No matter who you are, it has the ability to put a smile on your face.I love the very idea of magic. But it had always been something beyond the borders of reality, always out of reach.If I\u2019d ever been given a magic lamp, I\u2019d have gladly spent all three wishes on becoming a real magician.Those feelings were at the forefront of the memories I one day remembered from my previous life.My full name is Anne-Sophia Wynn Palletia, the First Princess of the Kingdom of Palletia.It had happened when I was five years old, and staring up into the sky.If I had magic, I could fly through that sky. That thought fluttering through my mind was the catalyst.If only I could use magic, I could fly. Just why had I thought of that? Before I had time to ask myself that, memories of my past life that I had forgotten had flooded into my head.It almost felt like someone had placed all the missing jigsaw pieces in my mind. That was the turning point in my, Anne-Sophia von Palletia\u2019s, life, when I recovered the part of myself that had been missing.It goes without saying that the memories of my previous life would be full of mysteries for the people of this world. Aeroplanes soaring through the sky, roads paved with asphalt with cars crisscrossing this way and that on top of them, and all the countless other conveniences of modern civilization besides.But, I had never seen any of them with my current eyes. In the world that I know, there are no planes or cars. Only birds and monsters soar through the sky, the rough roads aren\u2019t paved with asphalt, and only horse-drawn carriages travel down them, not gas-powered cars.Aristocratic families wielding national power were something that only really existed in the stories anymore, but I was a full-fledged princess. As I ruminated over the memories in my mind, the first word that came to my lips was\u2026\u201cI might be in trouble.\u201dI was in so much trouble, I couldn\u2019t help but say it. Even though I was such a young girl, I was in trouble. That\u2019s because, my thoughts and sensibilities had instantly become much more influenced by my previous life, than my relatively short time as Anne-Sophia.My duty as a member of the royal family? My pride as a member of the aristocracy? I was aware of them. I even still held some remnant feelings for them. But, I didn\u2019t care even a quarter as much as before. Because, in my past life, the world kept spinning perfectly fine without the help of nobles. Those had become my dominant feelings.My modern values found themselves completely incompatible with my previous existence as a \u2018member of the royal family\u2019. But, at the same time, I realized that breaking out of the mould of my current life would also be more trouble than it was worth. Honestly, having your memories of a previous life suddenly awaken in such a position, it\u2019s more annoying than anything else.\u201cWell, so be it.\u201dI was only five years old. I\u2019m sure that, over time, my sensibilities will change. Well, at least, that\u2019s what I hoped. Looking back in hindsight, I really was very optimistic.But, I was somehow even more optimistic about fulfilling my previous\u2019 life\u2019s dream than I was about solving that rather pressing problem.\u201cThat\u2019s right, this world has \u2018magic\u2019!\u201dYes, in this world magic wasn\u2019t the stuff of fairy tales or fantasy novels, but something that truly existed.Control over the four elements of fire, water, wind and earth. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand a thing about the practical theory of how it worked, but having seen it in person, my heart began doing cartwheels as I recalled those memories.If I used magic, maybe I really can fly through the sky. I wonder if such magic exists\u2026 Ahh, I\u2019m getting giddy, this is so exciting!\u201cI better strike whilst the iron is hot, huh?\u201dWith a new wave of determination flowing through me, I clenched my fist. Jumping out of my chair, I began to run. Throwing open the doors to my room, I dashed through the castle corridors as fast as I could.As I rounded the corridors, I bumped into a maid. Quickly bowing in apology, I tried to get past her\u2026\u201cY-Your Highness?! Please do not run in the hallway?!\u201dBut, before I could escape, I was held back from behind. Since I was so small, it was easy for the maid to pick me up in her arms.My feet didn\u2019t stop swinging even as I was lifted into the air, but I couldn\u2019t struggle loose with my childlike strength. The maid stubbornly refused to let me go either, gripping me tight. Looking back, I realized I actually knew this maid. Combing through my memories, I believe her name was Illya?\u201cOh, Illya. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d\u201cEven if you say that, you\u2019re still not allowed to run around the castle like that.\u201d\u201cUuu, meanie\u2026\u201dAfter realizing that escape was impossible, I quickly gave up. Seeing that I\u2019d finally given up resisting her, the maid called Illya lowered me back to my feet.\u201cJust whatever is the rush, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cI need to make a petition to father!\u201d\u201cP-Petition\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, a petition for I, Anne-Sophia, to learn magic!\u201d\u201cHaa, magic\u2026?\u201dIllya knelt down gently to meet my eyes. The look on her face seemed genuinely confused.\u201cYes, I want to learn how to use magic.\u201d\u201cI suppose it\u2019s a good thing to be motivated, but just why this, all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI want to fly in the sky.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cFlying. In the sky.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to learn magic?\u201d\u201cTo fly!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dShe looked like I was speaking in gibberish. Well, it makes sense. There was no precedent for using magic to fly as far as I knew, after all.\u201cThat\u2019s just one of the things I want to do with magic. I also want to use magic to beat up bad guys and help out people in need!\u201d\u201cMy, my, isn\u2019t that a wonderful dream? However, His Majesty is very busy. I\u2019ll make sure to pass along your request, so why don\u2019t we go back to your room for now, alright, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cMuuu, I guess\u2026 I\u2019ll give up on the petition for now and rely on Illya.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dAs if to say it wouldn\u2019t be any trouble to her at all, Illya gave her chest a light tap. It wasn\u2019t a modest chest, either. Looking closely, she really was a beauty. Was part of the reason she was chosen to be a maid in the royal castle just how pretty she is?Well, there was nothing else I could do, so I was brought back to my room. Even if I could go rifling through my previous life\u2019s memories, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything more I could learn that day. So, instead, I spent my time imagining all the things I could do once I started learning properly. I began to get giddy just thinking about all the possibilities.Thinking back, that was the beginning of my new life as Anne-Sophia von Palletia.I\u2019ll definitely do it! I\u2019ll definitely become a magician!\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aAfter that certain princess \u2018awoke\u2019, the years rolled by.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aIn the Kingdom of Palletia, there is a state-funded academy for the sons and daughters of royalty and nobility, called the Palletian National Aristocratic Academy With even foreign students from abroad being invited to study there, it can be considered a microcosm of high society at large.Of course, its chief purpose is education. That said, even if the focus is supposed to be on raising the grades of students without getting lost in the jumble of social hierarchies, nobles will be nobles and royals will be royals.Those of high status almost naturally come together, and those on lower strata can often find their future education in jeopardy if they step on the wrong toes.That\u2019s because it\u2019s much easier to lance a single boil than let conflicts continue since if powerful parents were dragged into the fray, things could very quickly move beyond a mere schoolyard dispute.Now then, today happened to be a particularly important day for the academy. The final exams of the students in their graduation year were over, and a big party was being thrown to celebrate all their efforts.As the students who had been putting in the hard yards these last few months mingled and socialized, elegant classical music was played by a small orchestra on the stage. Despite the rumours that had been floating about, it was a wonderfully pleasant and gorgeously decorated party\u2026 Or, at least, it was supposed to be.\u201cI hereby declare in front of all of you as my witnesses, that my engagement with Euphilia Magneta is henceforth annulled!\u201dThe First Prince of the Kingdom of Palletia and the heir apparent to the throne, Algard von Palletia, proudly proclaimed his declaration.With just those words that spelt out the cancelling of his engagement, that glittering party turned into what was essentially a courtroom.As she heard those words, Euphilia Magneta\u2019s eyes opened wide, but she bit her lip, not saying a word. She glared intensely at Algard, who stood above her.Euphilia was the daughter of Duke Magneta, who most considered to be the foremost amongst all the Kingdom\u2019s nobility. She was an exceedingly elegant and beautiful girl.Her long silvery hair hung down her waist, and those pink eyes contained an unmistakably strong will. It\u2019s often said of people with a strong gaze like hers that they can seem hard to approach, but that wasn\u2019t the case with her.If anything, that sharp gaze was part of her charm. As the fiancee of the Crown Prince, as the future Queen of the country, no one could dispute that she was more than dignified enough in appearance for the role.But, such a future was crumbling before her eyes. That said, this isn\u2019t something that had just happened out of the blue. The ongoing conflict between Algard and Euphilia was the #1 topic for gossip amongst all the academy\u2019s students.Algard von Palletia, as the next in line to the throne, was enrolled in the academy to establish life-long connections with other young nobles, as well as to receive an education in the liberal arts.At his side stood the daughter of Duke Magneta, Euphilia. Everyone gazed at them with a mixture of admiration and envy, the ideal couple to rule over the next chapter in the Kingdom\u2019s history.But, that ideal began to become murky the moment a daughter of a baron inserted herself between them. Speaking of said Baron\u2019s daughter, there she was, leaning on Algard\u2019s arm.\u201c\u2026Prince Algard, just why do you want to break off our engagement?\u201dSpeaking slowly but firmly, her voice never trembling, Euphilia asked him that question. But, her fists were curled so tightly that it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if her nails drew blood.In response to her question, Algard glared coldly back at Euphilia.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you aren\u2019t worthy of being my fiancee. What\u2019s more, I shall not let you escape justice for all the outrages you\u2019ve committed against Ryeini Cyan!Ryeini Cyan, the name of the girl who stood by Algard\u2019s side. She had a mature body but a cute face, and those big tear-stained eyes tickled one\u2019s urge to protect her.She had the look of someone who might collapse to the floor in a faint at any moment, the exact opposite of Euphilia who stood strong with a sharp glare. In a way, that was the root of all this.Originally, the relationship between Algard and Euphilia, who had been brought together as part of a political marriage, was one of shared solidarity in their duties to the country. In terms of true feelings towards one another, however, their relationship had not progressed much.That\u2019s why Ryeini, whose charms were the polar opposite of Euphilia\u2019s, very quickly found her way into Algard\u2019s heart. That said, Algard wasn\u2019t the only man who had his eyes on Ryeini, but that\u2019s a matter for another time.However, Ryeini was a baron\u2019s daughter. She wasn\u2019t fit to be by Algard\u2019s side, therefore Euphilia felt socially obligated to point that out.It was because of this that the relationship between the two, which had never been truly warm, began to fall into true discord. From the beginning, Algard had things he disliked about Euphilia, so that also became a factor.In any case, as Euphilia, a person who holds both herself and others to high standards, began to take a hard attitude towards Ryeini, Algard, in turn, began to look upon her more and more disfavourably.What\u2019s more, the rumours that began to swirl amongst the noble sons and daughters who attended the academy added fuel to the fire, helping to sour their relationship so much that it wasn\u2019t something that could be easily mended. And so, the house of cards that had been precariously wobbling up until now came crashing down.But, whilst Algard\u2019s feelings towards Euphilia had become decidedly cold, what of Euphilia\u2019s thoughts for Algard?Whilst she certainly had no real fondness for him, she had felt a certain kinship with him in the shared responsibilities they held and planned to support him as a pillar of the country. In a sense, feelings of camaraderie. Those were the feelings she had held towards him as she supported and lived with him these past two years.She\u2019d also not thrown away the possibility that her feelings might one day blossom into love. Euphilia believed that the best thing she could do in order to best carry out her duty was to work on herself, whilst supporting Algard in any way she could\u2026So, in a sense, the breaking off of the engagement wasn\u2019t the thing that shocked her the most. What was truly shocking to her was Algard\u2019s behaviour.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure what I should say about these \u2018outrages\u2019 you speak of, however, Prince Algard, have you received His Majesty\u2019s permission for this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have my father approve it later.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 Just why are you trying to dissolve the engagement our parents decided by yourself\u2026?! Do you understand just what you\u2019re doing?!\u201dIt would be a national embarrassment, simply put. Euphilia shouted out those words in complete disbelief.If he had told her that he wanted to end their engagement, she wouldn\u2019t have fought against it. This was a political marriage decided on when they were both just children, after all.But, she couldn\u2019t believe that Algard would just declare the engagement null and void on his own, without even informing anyone.What\u2019s more, this engagement had been a request from the royal family to the Duke of Magneta, in other words, it was Algard\u2019s side that had come to her parents to make it happen, not the other way around. There were so many problems with Algard\u2019s sudden declaration it was hard to know where to begin.\u201cI won\u2019t listen to any objections from father or mother, regardless! I will be the one to forge my own path in life!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a certain way of doing these things that have to be followed! Please reconsider this, Prince Algard! Just when did you become so blind?!\u201d\u201cBlind you say?! The only blind one here is you, Euphilia! You\u2019re not qualified to become Queen, blinded by your ambitions as you are, turning a blind eye to all those acts\u2026!\u201d\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t know what you mean by\u2026?!\u201d\u201cExcessively abusing and harassing Ryeini, theft and damage of her personal belongings, and even attempted assassination! And all with you being the one pulling the strings!\u201d\u201cWe can all testify to that. The number of misdeeds we\u2019ve seen her bring to bear against Miss Ryeini are too many to count!\u201dA group of men stepped forward to line up behind Algard. All of them were the sons of renowned noble families that together held large amounts of power in this country. What\u2019s more, Euphilia instantly recognized them as the other men that she had seen Ryeini clinging to at one time or another.Honestly speaking, Euphilia was someone who was seen as a nuisance by men, not least of all because of her excellent grades. Academic studies, magic, and even with the sword, none of them were a match for her.Euphilia, who had always enjoyed practising her combat skills as a form of self-defence, was also famous for her proficiency for magic, so when she combined these skills she could be counted amongst the strongest people in the Kingdom. This, along with her critical attitude and sharp looks, left her both envied by and alienated from many.Raised to be a model Queen-in-waiting, Euphilia sought to overcome any situation she found herself facing with strength, thus she sometimes was quite out of tune with the feelings of those around her. Therefore, it should be said that she lacked a certain consideration for the views of others.That\u2019s why Euphilia was so caught off guard when, besides Algard, those others lined up to accuse her as well. Justice should be on my side, so just why are they doing this? Those were her thoughts.\u201cRepent for your crimes and apologize to Miss Ryeini, Euphilia Magneta!\u201dJust what did she have to apologize for? She didn\u2019t understand, Euphilia didn\u2019t know just what she had done wrong. She had never experienced anything like this before.She had to speak up and correct them, protest that everything about this was wrong. But, for some reason, the words stuck in her throat.Nobody was believing her, and she couldn\u2019t bring the words to her lips. If you know you are in the right and speak correctly, then everything should fall into place\u2026 But, it seems that reality was working against that principle.This wasn\u2019t the first time something similar had happened, in that someone had sought to entrap her with malicious intent. But, this time was different. They weren\u2019t acting out of malice. Instead, they were acting out of their own beliefs, their own values.She couldn\u2019t understand it at all. That\u2019s why Euphilia, who had always stood so strong, felt her knees begin to buckle as she faced the reality that was unfolding before her. Yes, as if she really were about to fall to her knees, as if she was about to truly ask for forgiveness.\u2026But, just before she fell, Euphilia heard a strange sound.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dEuphilia wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed it. Algard also perked his ears up at the suspicious sound, as all the eyes in the room turned towards one of the banquet hall\u2019s huge windows.How would one describe it, exactly\u2026? It was a sound like rushing wind, mixed in with what sounded like\u2026 screaming?\u201c aaaaaaa AAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH ?!?!?!?!\u201dEventually, that sound became solely a scream. And, the massive window was completely shattered.Huh? That was the singular thought that swept through the room. Whatever had just smashed through the window continued to travel, hitting the ground hard and eventually rolling to a stop that positioned it perfectly between Euphilia and Algard.That trial-like atmosphere had completely dispersed in an instant, filled with the panicked footsteps of those people fleeing the shattered glass and everyone else staring in disbelief at what had just come flying in.\u201cOw ow ow\u2026 I still don\u2019t have enough control, I guess I need to do some more research, huh?\u201dThat flying object turned out to be a beautiful girl, who stood up and brushed a few errant shards of glass off her clothes.Wearing a leather jacket and trousers that were easy to move around in, she couldn\u2019t look more out of place in this banquet hall full of elegant gowns and neat dinner jackets.But, despite standing out like a sore thumb, she had her own sense of charm. Even though she didn\u2019t wear a lick of makeup, she still drew eyes wherever she went. Maybe the best way to put it was that she was\u2026 energetic? A diamond in the rough that would shine brighter than all the rest with a bit of polish.Even the patches of soot on her face couldn\u2019t cover up that eye-catching face. Bending over, the girl picked up what looked at first glance to be an ordinary broomstick, but on closer inspection was anything but.Those deep green eyes of hers had their own sort of adorable charm to them, but it was the colour of her hair that was the most breathtaking of all. That platinum blonde hair, just like Algard\u2019s, that one could call her proof of royalty.\u201cAh\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026!!\u201dSomeone pointed a finger at her, with a trembling voice. It was none other than Algard himself, whose pale expression was slowly changing from astonishment to anger.Once she turned to notice him, the girl raised a familiar hand in a wave.\u201cOh? Ohh, Allie! Did I interrupt something?\u201d\u201cELDER SISTEEEEEEEER?!\u201dThe girl who couldn\u2019t look more out of place in this showy venue, who was none other than the \u2018Problem Princess\u2019 of the Kingdom of Palletia Anne-Sophia von Palletia, gave a toothy grin.There is a certain \u2018princess\u2019 in the Kingdom of Palletia.\u201cThe Strongest Prodigal Child in Palletian History\u201d, \u201cThe Kingdom\u2019s #1 Maverick\u201d, \u201cThe Pure Distillation of Royal Palletian Madness\u201d, this Princess went by many names.Though, her official name was Anne-Sophia von Palletia. Her eccentricities seemed to multiply day by day, and the disturbances she caused were so numerous that \u201cOh, is that Princess Anne-Sophia again?\u201d had become one of the most common phrases in the capital.It is said that she attempted to harness the power of the wind, and went flying headfirst through a wall.It is said that she attempted to harness the power of fire to boil water to try and make a \u2018bath\u2019, and ended up with burns all over her body.It is said that she was the one who had defeated a group of monsters who were interfering with the new road-building project all by herself.It is said that the reason she acted out so much that it eventually broke the poor King\u2019s heart was that she didn\u2019t want to get married.There are so many stories about all the things she has gotten up to, that if you named it, Anne-Sophia had probably done it.She really was the Peculiar Princess, in a sense proving that lunatic idiocy and pioneering genius were two sides of the same coin.What\u2019s more, there was a certain popular phrase that was used to describe her.\u201cThe genius who loved magic more than anyone, but whom magic hated above all else.\u201dShe was a princess who couldn\u2019t use the types of magic that royalty and nobility took for granted in this world.That was who Anne-Sophia von Palletia was.And since she was unable to use magic in the same way as everyone else, she became the trailblazing progenitor of \u2018Magical Science\u2019, which she dubbed \u2018Magicology\u2019.\u2014(\u2026Did I come in at a bad time?)I, Anne-Sophia von Palletia, thought that.All sorts of young men and women are stood around, and judging by their suits and dresses they\u2019re probably sons and daughters of the nobility. What\u2019s more, all of them were staring at me weirdly.This might be my biggest blunder in a while, huh? I was just taking a test night flight with my flying magical tool, and when I was dreaming romantically about reaching out and grabbing a star, I ended up plummeting through that window back there.Looking down, I quickly checked on the condition of the \u2018Witch\u2019s Broom\u2019, the name I gave my flying magical tool. If it\u2019s broken, I\u2019d seriously burst into tears. Doesn\u2019t seem like anything is damaged other than my reputation! Alright, then there\u2019s no problems!As I looked back around at the venue properly, I spied my brother, Algard! That kid must be angry with me about one thing or another though, because he\u2019s glaring daggers at me.(Hm? But, just who is that kid hugging like he\u2019s trying to protect her? I\u2019ve never seen that girl before.)That girl is where Allie\u2019s fiancee should be standing, but why\u2019s she over there instead? Hmm? Just what\u2019s going on here?\u201cHey, Allie. You already have Miss Euphilia, but now you have another girl as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026T-This has nothing to do with you!!\u201dOh, he is mad. No, well, I guess he would be mad, huh? But, he also shrunk back a step, and seemed like he was a little terrified as well. Mm, well, I guess that makes sense. There may have been a few accidental traumas I inflicted here and there as we grew up.But, that\u2019s not important right now. I might be the black sheep of the royal family, but even I think it\u2019s a little weird for the future king to not be standing next to the future queen. I\u2019m not wrong, right?\u201cUmm, Miss Euphilia? What\u2019s going on? Oh, is she going to be something like a concubine?\u201dI turned from Allie and switched my glance to Miss Euphilia, who looked taken aback at the question. But, I had barely looked at her before she dropped her gaze to the floor.\u201cHm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201dHuh? What happened to Miss Euphilia? I always thought that she was a strong girl who\u2019d always speak her mind, even to adults, so she\u2019d be a really good queen in the future.But, right now she looks like she\u2019s about to cry\u2026 wait, is she actually crying? Is she upset because I broke the window? No, wait, that\u2019s not quite it. Wait, this situation, the way everyone is standing around, just why does it seem familiar\u2026?\u201cAhh, I got it. You\u2019re getting accused of things and having your engagement broken off, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wha?! \u201dHow do you\u2026? Euphilia\u2019s eyes seemed to say, as she looked back up at me. That usually iron cast expression of hers was gone as she stared at me, her pupils shaking in surprise.\u2026Ehh, seriously? In my \u2018previous life\u2019, I remember a few \u2018stories\u2019 that had this at a plot point, but it\u2019s seriously something that happens for real? The world sure is a strange place, isn\u2019t it? Well, not that I can say that.\u201cJust taking a look at the situation, it feels like Miss Euphilia is being backed into a corner?\u201d\u201cEh, um, why\u2026?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Okay! I\u2019ve decided!\u201dYou really shouldn\u2019t bully girls.I don\u2019t really know who is in the right here, but for now, let\u2019s just assume that everyone\u2019s in the wrong somehow. And, if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll protect Miss Euphilia, who doesn\u2019t have anyone by her side. I\u2019ll figure out who was in the right later.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Miss Euphilia. I\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kidnapping Miss Euphilia, so you can\u2019t blame her for this! Now, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s get out of here! Oh yeah, Allie, I\u2019ll tell mother and father about this for you, so we can have a family sit down about it later, okay?!\u201dWalking over to Miss Euphilia\u2019s side, I threw an arm around her shoulder. Hahaha, sorry about this. It really feels like the type of situation where I should carry her out like a princess, but I only have one hand to spare.\u201cUh, umm\u2026!\u201d\u201cWait, elder sist-!\u201d\u201c\u2026Later, Allie!\u201dI feel like some kind of phantom thief. With a flashy grin, I pulled Miss Euphilia to my waist and poured magical energy into one of the seals I\u2019d engraved onto my body.Kicking off the floor hard with my lightened body, I leapt through the window I\u2019d broken on my way in. That said, if I kept flying on this momentum alone, I\u2019d soon be having an unpleasant meeting with the ground. Miss Euphilia must have realized this, as she let out quite the scream.\u201cN\u2026 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ?!?!?!\u201d\u201cAha ha ha ha ha! Think of it as a fun bungee jump! Now, welcome to first-class air travel, my Lady!\u201dHooking the \u2018Witch\u2019s Broom\u2019 under my feet, I poured the magical power from my body into it. Just before we hit the ground, we suddenly started gaining altitude at exactly the same amount of speed that we\u2019d been falling with before.Now then, let\u2019s go and visit father!\uff0a\u3000\uff0a \u3000\uff0aThe Princess unloved by magic. Despite the fact that royalty and aristocracy in this world go hand in hand with magical talent, she was told that she didn\u2019t have the aptitude for casting even simple magic with success.And yet, the Princess still loved magic.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOrfans El Palletia, King of Palletia, was gracefully enjoying a well-earned tea break in his palace office.The governmental duties that a King has to carry out can be taxing, so one learns to savour the few spare moments of peace. It\u2019s important for your health to take a step back from work every once in a while, and that even goes for a King.\u2026If he didn\u2019t convince himself of that, he wouldn\u2019t be able to. There\u2019s always one problem or another cropping up in the administration, and what\u2019s more, there\u2019s several other major worries that he can never quite push aside. When his mind wandered, the face of a certain prodigal daughter came to mind, and he shook his head vigorously as if trying to banish it from his thoughts.Recently, that outrageous daughter of his has been suspiciously quiet. He\u2019d love to think that she\u2019s sorted out her act, but he wasn\u2019t so na\u00efve. Without a doubt, this was merely the calm before the storm.No good will come from mulling over it constantly, though. Pushing the thought to the furthest corner of his mind, he busied himself with his work, praying that nothing would happen. However, Orfan\u2019s sincere wish to the heavens was resoundingly and remorselessly shattered barely a moment later.\u201cYour Majesty! Sire! Please excuse my interruption! I bring an urgent report! Princess Anne-Sophia is\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahh, for goodness\u2019 sake! What is it this time?! Just what has that girl done now?!\u201dA shouting knight who had opened the door to his study had broken the news of the oncoming storm. It was a shout that signaled the return to the \u2018normal\u2019 lunacy.Orfans cast a rueful eye towards the heavens, then with one hand clutching his stomach which felt like it was preemptively sprouting a stress ulcer, he waved with his other hand to prompt the knight to report.\u201cHer Highness has invaded the Royal Palace using a flying magical tool! She has said that she requests an audience with Your Majesty, and\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd, what?! Spit it out man, let me hear it!\u201d\u201cY-Yes! Princess Anne-Sophia is in the company of Lady Euphilia, daughter to Duke Magneta. And, uh, at this point in time we believe this may be a kidnapping\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust what the hell has she done this time, that punk daughter of mine?!?!\u201dLady Euphilia Magneta, daughter to the Duke. As soon as he heard the name of his son, Algard\u2019s, fiancee mentioned in the same breath as his daughter\u2019s, Orfans felt an enormous dizzying spell wash over him, and he almost fell back into his chair.He was certain that this evening was meant to mark the occasion of the graduation party at the National Aristocratic Academy. But, just why was that girl here now? He couldn\u2019t help but wonder. The more he thought about it, the knight\u2019s theory about this being a kidnapping was growing more and more likely. He wouldn\u2019t put much past his daughter, after all.\u201cBring her in right away! Euphilia as well!\u201d\u201cA-As you command!\u201dHeaving a heavy sigh as the knight dashed back down the hallway, Orfans opened one of the drawers in his desk and removed a flask of medicine. It was stomach medicine, intended to combat the effects the stress his daughter\u2019s antics put him under had on his stomach.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that this flask of medicine was Orfan\u2019s most steadfast ally against the coming onslaught, though the irony was that this medicine itself was developed by none other than Anne-Sophia herself. Orfans recalled that, back when he found that out for the first time, he nearly sunk to his knees in despair.Taking a deep breath, he sat back down in his chair. He heard the knight\u2019s voice again from the other side of the door, requesting permission this time to enter. The moment he granted it, the door opened, and two people walked into his office.\u201cGood evening, father! Sorry for dropping by so suddenly!\u201dTee hee! Orfans felt a migraine coming on as he stared at Anne-Sophia, who had waltzed into the room without a care in the world. When he saw what she held, he prayed once more that this would all just end up to be a strange fever dream.Since, slung over the Princess\u2019 shoulder was none other than Euphilia, her face downcast. When Anne-Sophia hoisted her off her shoulder and let her stand on her own two feet, Euphilia\u2019s eyes widened and her face paled as she realized just where she found herself.\u201cY-Your Highness! I beg your pardon for my rudeness! P-Please forgive me!\u201d\u201cNo matter. I know that this isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s all because of that idiot. Now then, Anise?\u201d\u201cYes, father!\u201d\u201cReport. Just what on earth have you done this time\u2026?\u201d\u201cFather, let me just say this first, but this time I\u2019m really not the only one at fault!\u201d\u201cOh? I\u2019ll be the judge of that, after I hear what you have to say. So?\u201d\u201cI was doing a night-flight test, and just as I was on the verge of a new breakthrough, I suddenly found myself crashing the Academy\u2019s party! Via the window!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 utter fooool!!\u201dOrfans jumped out of his chair, rounded his desk and, approaching Anne-Sophia, brought his fist down on top of her head.GYARGH! With a decidedly un-ladylike scream, Anne-Sophia clutched her head. As his daughter looked up at him with teary puppy dog eyes, Orfans\u2019 migraine kicked into overdrive.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026! Just how many times do you have to do these things before it finally gets through your thick skull to perhaps stop and think, first?! Or is there just a big empty space between your ears?!\u201d\u201cFather, progress was never made by anyone afraid of failure!\u201d\u201cBut you could take some damned precautions, is what I\u2019m saying! Repeating the same thing over and over expecting a new result is the height of lunacy, you fool!\u201dAgain, another fist to the top of the head. This time, Anne-Sophia knelt down, as she held her head. Orfans\u2019 shoulders heaved as he took deep breaths in an attempt to calm down.Though he said all that, so far nearly dying whilst crashing one of the most important events of the year\u2019s social calendar was within the scope of what he had come to expect from his daughter, but Euphilia being here was outside of his wildest expectations. Now then, just why on earth was she here?\u201cEuphilia, why are you with Anise?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201dWhen Orfans turned to ask her directly, Euphilia stumbled over her words, biting her bottom lip and staring at the floor. Orfans couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow when he saw that.In Orfans\u2019 mind, Euphilia was already essentially his daughter, even if she wasn\u2019t officially yet. He had a bad feeling about all this, when he saw how the girl who would one day be the Queen of the next generation was trembling slightly in front of him. He knew that something was wrong, and instinctually he also knew that it wasn\u2019t just because of this absurd situation.\u201cAllie said he\u2019d cancel his engagement, Father.\u201d\u201cHah?\u201d\u201cLike I said, Allie is gonna cancel his engagement.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..Hah?\u201d\u201cCancel his engagement.\u201d\u201cWho? With who, again?\u201d\u201cAllie, with Miss Euphilia.\u201d\u201cWho said they\u2019d do that? Algard did?\u201d\u201cLike I said, it was Allie!\u201dAs Anne-Sophia finished delivering her report whilst rubbing her sore head, Orfans stood in silence for a long time. He needed all that time to truly digest what he\u2019d just heard, after all.When the pieces finally came together in his head, his stomach twisted like it never had before, and he almost doubled over from the pain. Forcing himself to endure it to preserve his dignity and pride as the nation\u2019s sovereign, he turned to speak to Euphilia, the corners of his mouth twitching.\u201cMy apologies. But, could you do me a favour and tell me that I\u2019m having a nightmare? Euphilia, please?\u201d\u201c\u2026I would, Your Highness, but it\u2019s a grave crime to lie to the King.\u201dAs Euphilia confirmed this wretched reality with a bowed head, Orfans felt like he\u2019d spit blood.In Orfan\u2019s mind, this was the worst possible turn of events.\u201cW-Why?! Just why did he break his engagement in the middle of a party?! Why didn\u2019t he say a damn word to me?! If he had, I would\u2019ve had the chance to knock some damn sense into Algard\u2019s skull before he could do something so stupid!!\u201d\u201cOh, it seems that Allie has a new girlfriend other than Miss Euphilia as well, Father.\u201d\u201cWho the hell?! \u2026Impossible, is it that baron\u2019s daughter?!\u201dThe rumour about Algard having fallen in love with a low-ranking Baron\u2019s daughter flitted through Orfan\u2019s mind.He didn\u2019t specifically mind his son falling in love with someone, but that\u2019s something that you should be open about with your main wife, and only pursue with her consent.\u201cCertainly, I\u2019ve heard that he has become enamoured with her\u2026 but to go so far as to break his engagement with Euphilia?! Does that mean he intends to take that Baron\u2019s daughter as his main wife?!\u201d\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t ask Allie about that, but I figure that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going on, yeah. Ah, right, we need to have a family meeting later! I\u2019ve told you, so you have to attend, Father!\u201dAs he watched his daughter say that with a big grin on her face, Orfans stood in stunned silence as he unconsciously raised his fist, only stopping himself at the last moment from bringing it down for the third time on top of Anne-Sophia\u2019s head.\u201cR-Ridiculous\u2026 a Baron\u2019s daughter?! Who hasn\u2019t received even the slightest education on becoming Queen?! Such a person becoming the main wife of the future King\u2026 Does Algard understand just what he\u2019s doing?!\u201d\u201cAllie really is giving us a headache, just rushing off and doing whatever he likes, huh\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs if you have room to talk?!\u201dOrfans yelled and rubbed at his temples in response to Anne-Sophia\u2019s wistful remark.This isn\u2019t just one bad incident. This had the potential to become the first in an uncountable number of dominos to fall.First, there was the royal family\u2019s relationship with Duke Magneta, Euphilia\u2019s father. In the first place, it was the royal family who had come to him to request that Euphilia be engaged to Algard.This was to both invite the brilliant and talented Euphilia into the royal family, as well as to secure the support of Duke Magneta for Algard, who was supported by the royal family as the heir to the throne.Duke Magneta, who truly loved his exceptionally gifted daughter, was reluctant at first to give away her hand, but he was eventually convinced due to his loyalty to the royal family as well as his personal friendship with Orfans.In other words, breaking the engagement is the same as spitting on Duke Magneta\u2019s sincere honour and loyalty.Orfans already had some idea that the relationship between Euphilia and Algard was rocky, Perhaps, Euphilia would have liked to break off the engagement herself? Such things were discussed in private.However, it was eventually agreed that faith should be placed in Euphilia to carry out her duties to support the country, and likewise the royal family would never abandon the engagement\u2026 Or, at least, that\u2019s what both sets of parents had agreed to.(If Grantz finds out about this\u2026 T-This\u2019ll be a disaster\u2026!)Duke Grantz Magneta, a talented military man and swordmaster, loyal to the throne and a close personal friend of Orfans. Orfans knew that, although he was often strict with his daughter\u2019s education, he also loved her dearly.His strictness only came from him thinking for her sake. In order to prepare Euphilia for the harsh realities of being Queen, and to best fulfill his duties to the royal family, he educated her as a Duke, not as her father.Duke Magneta was also a ferocious man, when he needed to be. Before he became King, Orfans was often saved by that ferocity, but now that he considered the possibility of being on the receiving end of that violence, he felt a chill run down his spine.This wasn\u2019t something so simple as merely breaking an engagement, this was something that could lead to problems on the national level.As the leader of the country, just what could he make of such an outrageous turn of events? If he found himself staring down the tip of Duke Magneta\u2019s sword in the near future, he wouldn\u2019t have any excuses.Orfans would never have forgiven Algard if he had told him about his intention to break off the engagement in advance.However, he may have been able to spin a broken engagement as something that was unavoidable. But, above all, he would have had to deny to the ends of the earth that it was because Algard had found a lover.What\u2019s more, that lover being who she is\u2026 She was merely the daughter of a Baron. It goes without saying that she isn\u2019t suitable as a fiancee to the Crown Prince. Perhaps this would be different if she had accomplished some great feat or possessed some amazing talent, but as far as he knew this wasn\u2019t the case.Meanwhile, Euphilia had been educated ever since she was young to be the very ideal of virtue and determination.Compared to her, he couldn\u2019t imagine Ryeini Cyan was ready to step into those shoes at all. In the first place, if she possessed the proper faculties to do so, then this sort of farce wouldn\u2019t have unfolded in the first place.To sum it all up, at this time, under these circumstances, there wasn\u2019t any possible way the royal family could accept Ryeini Cyan as a legitimate fiancee to Algard. It was simply impossible.What\u2019s more, Euphilia had been willing to continue supporting Algard, it was he alone who wished to cancel the engagement.Worst of all; this was an act that had been witnessed by an entire banquet hall\u2019s worth of people. It could hardly be swept under the rug now.He couldn\u2019t see a way to solve this situation. Or, rather, before thinking of solving it, Orfans wondered whether he\u2019d still have his head come sunrise. As he thought that, he could see in his mind the face of his friend Duke Magneta, a man who loved his daughter more than anything else in the world.\u201cUgh\u2026 Guh\u2026..!\u201dAs his stomach pains reached new heights, Orfans couldn\u2019t stand anymore and had to lean back on his desk to keep himself upright. The stress-induced pain in his stomach felt like it was spreading through his whole body.\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cY-Your Highness! Please be strong!\u201dAnne-Sophia and Euphilia jumped forward straight away to support Orfans. Then, supported by both of their shoulders, the two girls managed to sit the King back down in his chair.\u201c\u2026Why, Algard? How could you do such a thing\u2026?\u201dOrfans hadn\u2019t believed that Algard was so utterly incompetent. If he was properly lead and supported, surely someday he would be\u2026 Yes, although he may not have been a King to leave a mark on the annals of history, he surely would have been competent enough with the proper support.It was for that reason\u2026 Yes, it was for that reason he and Anne-Sophia had agreed that she could abandon her right to the throne.\u201c\u2026This really is all because of my own lack of strength, I can\u2019t apologize enough\u2026\u201dSeeing Orfans\u2019 downcast face, Euphilia felt to her knees, apologizing profusely for her inability to prevent this. Her shoulders trembled terribly, and it was clear that she was on the verge of tears.Orfans bit his lip in regret as he watched Euphilia, who had always acted with such grace and determination before. If he didn\u2019t open his mouth to speak, he felt like he\u2019d bite down on his lip so hard he\u2019d draw blood.\u201cWeeeell, Allie always had a bit of an inferiority complex, huh\u2026? Guess it can\u2019t really be helped, Miss Euphilia?\u201d\u201cYou of all people shouldn\u2019t be the one saying that!\u201dIt was certainly true, Orfans was well aware that Algard had somewhat of an inferiority complex.But, that was the fault of none other than this reckless daughter of his, Anne-Sophia!Although she was a problem child, it was indisputable that Anne-Sophia was a pioneering inventor, always showing off some new concept or diagram that had never even been dreamed of before.What could Algard hope but think, when compared to an older sister such as her? At any rate, it wasn\u2019t anything positive. She must have been at least somewhat aware of it, since Anne-Sophia had kept her distance from Algard as of late, however\u2026\u201cHey, I gave up my right to inherit the throne, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cThe problem is everything else that you do!\u201d\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll just get kicked out of the royal family completely, that\u2019s a great idea!\u201d\u201cStop saying that so proudlyyyyyy!!\u201dAs Anne-Sophia stuck out her chest pridefully at her excellent new idea, Orfans grabbed her and shook her back and forth. As he shook his daughter this way and that, Orfans thought to himself once again\u2026Ah, if only Anne-Sophia was a normal human being. And a man, to boot. Then, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much.Although Anne-Sophia was a member of the royal family, he\u2019d done everything in his power to keep her from state affairs, as if cloaking it in mosquito nets to stop this solitary bloodsucker.But, that girl\u2019s \u2018magicology\u2019 is the main reason why she couldn\u2019t be excluded completely from royal affairs.The magical potency of the Palletian Kingdom was increasing exponentially due to Anne-Sophia\u2019s \u2018magicology\u2019. It had already become something that the Kingdom of Palletia couldn\u2019t easily do without anymore.He knew that a major part of the reason for Algard\u2019s inferiority complex was due to the fact that, although Anne-Sophia barely seemed like a proper royal at all, she had still proven herself to be a major force in this country through talent alone.And, so, in order to prevent Algard from feeling like his position was under threat, she acted up and pretended to be a \u2018problem child\u2019 to put him at ease. Or, rather, that\u2019s what Orfans wished was the truth.\u201cFather, Father! Please have mercy on me, I\u2019m going to hurl! Mercy!\u201d\u201cI have no mercy for the likes of you\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut, at least hear me out! If things keep going like this, then who knows what Duke Grantz is going to do to you for revenge, Father!\u201d\u201cPlease stop reminding me of the reality I\u2019d like to avoid\u2026!!\u201d\u201cHowever, I, Anne-Sophia, have a plan to save Father from his predicament!\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201dOrfans, who had almost been overtaken by dark thoughts as he considered whether or not shaking his daughter until she vomited was a just punishment, stopped and looked at Anne-Sophia.Releasing her, Anne-Sophia quickly darted away from him and hid behind Euphilia, who had been watching the heartwarming (?) father-daughter bonding moment in silence. Watching his daughter use Euphilia like some kind of shield, Orfans glared at her. Did he really raise such a cowardly girl?\u201cIn the first place, one of the main reasons for the engagement was to strengthen the ties between our family and Duke Magneta\u2019s family, and to show the rest of the country that we\u2019re united, right?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. Of course, I\u2019d hoped that Euphilia could support Algard in future, but that was only part of it.\u201d\u201cTheeeen, if that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s still a way to break off that engagement, whilst still keeping a good relationship between the two families!\u201d(\u2026 I have an awful feeling about thiiiis! )Orfans\u2019 mouth began to twitch again as Anne-Sophia spoke with a big grin.Being her Father, Orfans had gained something of a sixth sense when it came to this sort of thing. He was absolutely convinced that she was thinking about something that he\u2019d need to do everything in his power to prevent.\u201c\u2026For now, I\u2019ll hear you out. Just what is your idea?\u201dAnne-Sophia\u2019s smile only grew brighter as she answered him.\u201c\u2026Just give Miss Euphilia to me instead!\u201dThe silence was so piercing that it somehow hurt his ears.Euphilia, as well as Orfans, looked at Anne-Sophia wordlessly.\u201c\u2026Just what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI want Miss Euphilia as a test subj- AHEM! I mean, rather, I want her as my research assistant!\u201d\u201cYouuuu! What did you just say?! Don\u2019t cover it up with a cough! Out with it!!\u201d\u201cI know that Miss Euphilia is a really talented magician! She can use all sorts of magic and I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s a once in a generation genius! I\u2019ve always hoped that she could lend me a hand with my research\u2026!\u201dIt\u2019s certainly true that Euphilia is an exceptionally gifted girl. She excelled not only in her regular studies, but as a magician as well. And her ability with the sword, which she had only taken up as a personal interest, was nothing to be sniffed at either.From the perspective of Anne-Sophia, the pioneering maverick behind \u2018magicology\u2019, it only made sense that she would want her as an assistant. He could agree to the research assistant part, the problem lay with that \u2018test subject\u2019 line she had tried to cover up.\u201cBut, just how is that meant to convince Duke Magneta not to kill me, you problem child\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe story about Miss Euphilia\u2019s engagement being broken has probably spread all over the capital! There\u2019s no way to cover it up now! So, we\u2019ll have to do something crazy instead! That\u2019s why, you can use me to save the day! The country\u2019s #1 problem child!\u201d\u201cStop saying things like that so proudly\u2026! So, what, I\u2019m meant to sell Euphilia out to you?!\u201d\u201cSorry for being blunt, but you need to think of Miss Euphilia\u2019s future, since in everyone\u2019s eyes she\u2019s been scorned and tossed away by the royal family! At her age, do you think it would be easy to get her another engagement now with a decent noble?\u201dThose words sent a pang through Orfan\u2019s heart.A young lady tossed aside by the royal family, there\u2019s no way her future marriage prospects wouldn\u2019t be affected. What\u2019s more, if Algard became king, her situation would only worsen as the woman jilted by the King himself.However, when it came to marrying her off outside of the country, Euphilia\u2019s genius became a handicap. To put it simply, it would be very difficult to find a decent match for Euphilia that would be loyal to the royal family of this country. Euphilia\u2019s future prospects had narrowed tremendously in the space of an evening.Euphilia was just reaching a marriageable age as well, if she were to have to wait much longer, questions would be raised about her age. That would just be adding insult to injury.\u201cSo, if she learns about Magicology and helps me develop new technologies, I\u2019m sure that Miss Euphilia can regain her honour! After that, she\u2019ll definitely be a perfect bride! Also, if enough time passes, I\u2019m sure that she and Allie can at least make up!\u201d\u201cYou certainly spin a good story. Alright, fine, let\u2019s say that this is all well and good. But, why don\u2019t you tell me what you really want?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that I\u2019m gonna miss out on the opportunity of making a research assistant this good mine, am I?!\u201d\u201cURAAAAGH!!\u201d\u201cT-The death claaaaw?! My face, my face is being crusheeed\u2026!\u201dOrfans jumped up, grabbing Anne-Sophia\u2019s face and lifting her into the air.Anne-Sophia tried to pull his hand off and struggle free, but eventually she realized resistance was futile.As he glared at Anne-Sophia, Orfans couldn\u2019t help but think that what she said was only one part of her plan.Right now, Magicology was something pursued almost entirely by Anne-Sophia alone. Although she was a problem child, she was at least considerate enough to try and take measures not to put other people in danger.She only ever disclosed some of her research results to a trusted few, and she jealously guarded her notes and technology until she felt it was ready to be released to the public at large. That\u2019s why Anne-Sophia kept the people at her side to the barest minimum and accepted being out of the public eye, despite being a member of the royal family.So, Orfans was truly surprised that she requested to take Euphilia as a research assistant.\u201cYou\u2019re still hiding something, aren\u2019t you, Anise?\u201d\u201cYour hand\u2026 Let me go\u2026 My skull is gonna\u2026!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to learn even if I do this\u2026\u201dWith a sigh, Orfans released his iron claw grip on Anne-Sophia. Rubbing her face, Anne-Sophia got back to her feet and spoke.\u201cWell, hmm\u2026 Even if you say I\u2019m hiding it, it\u2019s not really something I need to hide.\u201d\u201cOh? Try me.\u201d\u201cI just want to be by her side. Since I think Miss Euphilia is really great, after all!\u201d\u201cHah?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to assume that you mean that in a sense that she\u2019s more than just a potential test subject for your harebrained experiments?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is, I like her as a woman.\u201dOrfan recalled the memories he\u2019d done his best to push out of his mind over the years.That\u2019s right. At one point, he had genuinely considered potential matches for Anne-Sophia. But, it never happened. Of course, part of that was because of her eccentricities, but Anne-Sophia herself was also adamantly against it.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna marry a man! It has to be a woman, at least! I wanna marry for love! So! An engagement! Is! Out of the question! But, if I have to choose, then I don\u2019t mind marrying Illya!\u201dThe utter pandemonium that resulted from that shouted declaration, Orfans still remembered it clearly, as much as he would love to forget.Forget his lips, Orfans could feel both his cheeks twitching something fierce as he looked at Anne-Sophia.In the corner of his eye, he could see Euphilia, who was slowly backing away towards the door.Anne-Sophia locked eyes with Orfans, and spoke with that same big smile;\u201cI will\u2026 definitely make Miss Euphilia happy! So, Father, please allow me to have her!\u201dWith those words, Orfans stomach ulcer and migraine intensified to untold extremes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnne-Sophia\u2019s request couldn\u2019t be accepted or rejected right then and there. Orfans informed them that he would be discussing the matter with various individuals involved, and dismissed Anne-Sophia and Euphilia for the evening.\u201cYou\u2019re staying at the royal palace tonight, right? Miss Euphilia?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 I would return home, but it\u2019s already so late\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, do you want to stay in my room?\u201dThe moment Anne-Sophia asked her that, Euphilia stepped back and wrapped her arms around herself in protection. As Euphilia looked as wary as she could possibly be, even Anne-Sophia was slightly taken aback.Well, it was an understandable reaction. If you\u2019re asked that question, after hearing what you just had, then there were some rather immodest implications.\u201cSo, the rumours really were true\u2026?\u201d\u201cRumours?\u201d\u201cThat Princess Anne-Sophia\u2026 um\u2026 prefers the same-sex\u2026\u201d\u201cAhh, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. Well, it\u2019s not as if I find men disgusting, but when it comes to marrying someone, there\u2019s no way it could be a man! If I\u2019m going to fall in love, it has to be a beautiful mature lady or a cute girl, right?!\u201dJust what was she saying with such a pure smile? Euphilia thought to herself that her title as the Kingdom\u2019s Top Problem Child really wasn\u2019t for show.Despite being Algard\u2019s fiancee, Euphilia didn\u2019t have much prior contact with Anne-Sophia. In fact, the two of them were intentionally kept apart.It wasn\u2019t as if she wasn\u2019t completely ignorant of her, though, and even if she wasn\u2019t one to gossip, if rumours are repeated enough she\u2019ll eventually hear them whether or not she wants to.\u201cBut, what about your principles as a member of royalty\u2026?\u201d\u201cI left that sort of thing in Mother\u2019s stomach when I moved out!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you feel sorry for Her Majesty?!\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I guess if you put it that way\u2026\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t you think you ought to do something about it?!\u201dEuphilia began to feel her own headache coming on. Pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation, she realized she was far too exhausted to warrant continuing this conversation. She couldn\u2019t understand the Princess\u2019 thought process at all.She wanted to turn on her heel and never look back, having such a strange person look at them in such a strange way, but she knew full well that in doing so she\u2019d be turning her back on her own future.The prediction that Anne-Sophia shared with Orfans back in the study wasn\u2019t off the mark, Euphilia herself could see that was the most likely outcome.Likewise, Anne-Sophia\u2019s suggestion of earning credit to rebuild her reputation wasn\u2019t a bad one, either. The problem is that the one giving out the credit here would be none other than that Anne-Sophia.\u201cNow, now, instead of thinking about me, let\u2019s think more about your future, Miss Euphilia. It\u2019s our royal family that\u2019s wronged you after all, right? If we don\u2019t do something about this soon, then Lord Grantz is going to take my Father on a date to the Festival of Blood.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think Father would do something like that. If anything, he\u2019ll just scold me\u2026\u201dFor the sake of the nation\u2019s future, she was to become someone worthy enough to become its next Queen. And the one who had guided her on the path was none other than her great father, Grantz Magneta. Just how could she face him now? Euphilia\u2019s gaze dropped to her feet as her thoughts grew dark.Euphilia truly had no idea about the details of the crimes she supposedly committed, but what she could understand is that they were probably fabricated to suit the desires of certain people. The House of Magneta is a very powerful ducal family, this may have all been part of a scheme to curb their power.Just what on earth turned Algard from the path of reason, though, was another headache-inducing problem entirely. Just what could she have done to prevent it? Euphilia wondered about that to herself.\u201cYou\u2019re looking really down!\u201d\u201c Mugyuh ?!\u201dAs Euphilia was deep in thought, suddenly both her cheeks were pinched and squeezed. Then, they were sandwiched between Anne-Sophia\u2019s hands.\u201cLike I thought, I really can\u2019t afford to leave you alone right now, can I, Miss Euphilia?! Well, then, let\u2019s go! To my room!\u201d\u201cEh, wait, hold on just a moment, Princess Anne-Sophia?!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t take no for an answer!\u201dHoisting Euphilia back over her shoulder, Anne-Sophia raced down the hall. As she was being royally abducted again, Euphilia couldn\u2019t help but scream out in panic.\u201cS-Somebooody! Someone please stop Her Highness, someboooody!!\u201dEuphilia\u2019s screams didn\u2019t tail off, they only grew louder. But, the people they raced past in the halls could only offer wryly sympathetic grimaces in response to her desperate appeals.It\u2019s as if they were telling her it was futile. Then, pretending that they saw nothing, those knights and servants returned to their business.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aI return, my dear room!After carrying her all the way here, I arrived at my room in the Royal Villa. Putting Miss Euphilia down, I cleared through the mountain range of documents that marked the spot where my desk stood until I found a chair for her.\u201cIt\u2019s a little messy, but make yourself at home. I\u2019ll get a cup of tea prepared for you, so just wait a second.\u201d\u201c\u2026I believe I understand now. There\u2019s no way I could stop you with words alone.\u201dI beamed at Miss Euphilia, whose shoulders sagged as if she\u2019d given up.My personal room was full to the rafters with research material and all sorts of other books and documents. I mainly use this room for brainstorming and theory crafting, whilst I do the more practical stuff in my workshop.This Royal Villa itself is on the edge of the royal palace\u2019s grounds. I used to have my own private room back in the royal palace, of course, but this villa was built partly because I\u2019d conceded my right to be in line for the throne, and because I caused too many problems back at the main palace.I was actually quite happy about it, but Father seemed like he was at his wit\u2019s end when he ordered this place built. I really am a bad person, you say? Well, what\u2019s done is done, right?\u201cPlease excuse me, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIllya! Please serve some tea to help Miss Euphilia relax!\u201dAfter knocking once, my personal maid, Illya, entered the room. Having been with me for over ten years, she curtseyed once as if this was all par for the course, then set about readying the tea.There\u2019s a complete tea set already in my room, so it can be prepared straight away. Using a magical tool that took the shape of a tea kettle, Illya briskly set to work boiling the water and preparing leaves.Miss Euphilia seemed somewhat impressed as she watched intently. It wasn\u2019t just Illya\u2019s skill either, she was also gazing at some of the magical tools I had in my room.\u201cThere are so many magical tools, I\u2019ve never seen some of these before, either\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s because I have a few prototypes laying around here that I haven\u2019t released to the public, yet.\u201d\u201cIf anything, this place is full of terrifying traps. Once you get used to these tools, the thought of working anywhere else is\u2026\u201dIllya muttered to herself, her eyes glazed over. How can she keep her face so expressionless? That\u2019s scary.Though, I guess it is true that there\u2019s a lot of prototypes here that I tried to model after furniture and appliances that were commonplace in my previous life. I suppose Illya was the one who benefited from it the most.\u201cBut, they\u2019re convenient, so it\u2019s fine, right?\u201d\u201cThe problem is that they\u2019re too convenient. So, just how inconvenient must the wider world seem now by comparison? Truly an ominous thought, wouldn\u2019t you say, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine, since I really love the Illya who wants to stay with me forever!\u201d\u201cHa ha ha, and just who was the person who made sure that the outer moat of the palace was filled, simply so that I couldn\u2019t escape?\u201d\u201cJust who would do something so dreadful?! Hmmm, it was Father, wasn\u2019t it? Just call me a detective!\u201d\u201cIncorrect. The true culprit is the devil in front of me.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m a human, Illya. Should we get your eyes checked?\u201dMy banter with Illya was the same as ever, today. Well, we\u2019ve been together for such a long time now and she was my crush back then, not to mention she got caught up in a few of my nostalgic experiments from when I was younger, so as a result Father assigned her the job of being my overseer.But, even so, I take pride in the fact that I\u2019ve made Illya\u2019s day to day life quite a bit more convenient!Miss Euphilia looked pretty shocked at our conversation. Hmm, well, I guess it makes sense? Even if she\u2019s been a maid for the royal family for years now, she must be surprised to see us having a light chat, considering the difference in status.\u201cSo, Your Highness. Just why is Prince Algard\u2019s fiancee, Lady Euphilia, here?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, that\u2019s because Allie broke off his engagement with Miss Euphilia at the graduation party. I saw that she was being backed into a corner, so I kidnapped her and brought her back to the palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026Amazing. I honestly don\u2019t even know where I should start? First of all, just what on earth were you doing there? Secondly, breaking off an engagement in public like that? With Lady Euphilia? If this is a joke, it\u2019s in quite poor taste.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s the truth. You know what they say, truth is stranger than fiction, right?\u201d\u201cI see, but that phrase has less persuasive power coming from the clinically insane.\u201d\u201cImpudence! Impudeeeence!\u201dWell, I might say she\u2019s being impudent, but this is how Illya and I have always been. It\u2019s just how we show our love.As we went back and forth, Miss Euphilia stayed quiet, and looked a little restless. Noticing this, Illya coughed as if to get the conversation back on track.\u201cAnd, so? Just why is Lady\u00a0 Euphilia here?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s here to be my <ruby>test subj- <rt>guinea pig</rt></ruby> <b>AHEM</b> \u2026 I was thinking that if she worked under me as an assistant, she might be able to earn some credit and help wipe away some of the rumours from the engagement being broken\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201dAs Illya stared at me with dead-looking eyes, I nodded.I don\u2019t know why, but Illya turned to look at Miss Euphilia with a truly sympathetic expression on her face. It was like she was looking at a cow about to be sold off to the abattoir.Miss Euphilia could only return Illya\u2019s look with a puzzled expression, though. Sighing, Illya returned to look at me.\u201c\u2026So, you\u2019ve finally lost your mind, haven\u2019t you? This truly is unfortunate, Your Highness. All this time I thought you making people unhappy was simply an unfortunate byproduct of your behaviour, but now you\u2019re beginning to take real strides in entrapping people in misery, aren\u2019t you?\u201dWait wait wait, isn\u2019t that actually a little too mean?!\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aAfter Illya revealed her innermost thoughts, she sighed deeply as she ignored her master\u2019s aghast expression, and returned to the matter at hand.\u201cAre you intending to ruin Lady Euphilia\u2019s life?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to do the opposite, actually?!\u201d\u201cUwah, she\u2019s even saying she\u2019s doing it for a good reason? The road to hell truly is paved with good intentions, isn\u2019t it? What a devil.\u201d\u201cPrincess! I\u2019m a princess, Illya!\u201d\u201cAre you listening? I know better than anyone just what this means, since I can\u2019t escape anymore. So, please take note of what I\u2019m saying now; Have you truly gone mad? No, I suppose you\u2019ve been mad since the beginning?\u201d\u201cIllyaaaaaaaa!\u201dIs she angry? Or bawling? Ignoring Anne-Sophia who beat ineffectually at her dress like a crying child, Illya turned to Euphilia once again.There was something unsettling hidden in the depths of those eyes, but they were also overflowing with empathy. Euphilia found herself shrinking away from them involuntarily.\u201cLady Euphilia, you shouldn\u2019t be too hasty to accept. Please don\u2019t listen to this devil whispering in your ear.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\u201cBy no means should you make a deal with the devil. Understand? The moment you do, she\u2019ll take your soul and drag you down to hell, you know?\u201d\u201cD-Does she really want to do such awful things to me\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo. The issue is the tendency to become \u2018collateral damage\u2019, and even if you get angry, \u2018the ends will always justify the means\u2019, Lady Euphilia.\u201dAs she finished speaking, a shudder ran up Illya\u2019s body, as if in telling Euphilia that she recalled some terrible memory.Not quite understanding the meaning of the phrases she spoke, Euphilia looked at her in askance. Nearby, Anne-Sophia had given up on stopping Illya, and had resigned herself to sulking next to the desk.\u201cLady Euphilia, no matter what, I can assure you that the Princess\u2019 intentions no doubt come from a good place. Although I\u2019m sure that some of her own personal desires played a part, she was thinking of you first and foremost.\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 Well, I understood at least that much, somehow\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, that isn\u2019t the issue at hand. To phrase it one way, the Princess is like a strong drug.\u201d\u201cA strong drug\u2026? Ah, yes. I think I understand what you mean.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure if I should feel sad for the Princess that you didn\u2019t deny or it, or pleased that you agree with me. At any rate, it\u2019s fortunate that we\u2019ve reached some form of understanding. However, I have to wonder if you understand just what I truly mean, Lady Euphilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean by that?\u201dEuphilia\u2019s eyebrows narrowed at Illya\u2019s words. The idea that Anne-Sophia is a powerful drug was a simple enough idea for Euphilia to understand. What she had created had inherently changed and strengthened the power of the Kingdom of Palletia. She truly had many remarkable achievements to her name, even if she happened to also be the most infamous eccentric in the Kingdom.What\u2019s more, she also had the power to change her life, so she just didn\u2019t understand what Illya\u2019s problem was. Illya, meanwhile, correctly guessed that was how Euphilia interpreted it, so she continued to speak.\u201cThe Princess\u2019 inventions are wonderful. Just looking at the room around you, I\u2019m sure you can already tell how incredible some of them really are.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure that if these spread to the world, everyone\u2019s daily lives will improve.\u201d\u201cAnd therein lies the problem.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOnce you\u2019ve entered this world of hers, there\u2019s no going back. This needs to be made crystal clear; once you choose to go down this path, you\u2019ll never be able to turn away from it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s overstating it\u2026?\u201dIllya raised her voice slightly, wondering if Anne-Sophia herself would have any objections. But, she remained slumped over the desk, barely moving at all.Seeing that there was no rebuttal coming, Illya shook her head at Euphilia\u2019s words.\u201cImagine, for instance, if you took away fire from a civilization that had come to rely on it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, I understand. So that\u2019s how it is?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you all this now. This place is far too \u2018convenient\u2019. The way that the Princess sees the world is too difficult for me to understand, but, once you\u2019ve tasted the forbidden fruit, there\u2019s no going back. Once you come to know that devilish convenience.\u201dAnne-Sophia\u2019s inventions are truly amazing. But, because they\u2019re so amazing, it\u2019s hard to live without them once you\u2019ve come to know them.Once they\u2019ve grown used to it, humans are loathe to give up the benefits of a convenient life. So, that\u2019s why she compared Anne-Sophia to a powerful drug.\u201cCertainly, with the situation the way it is, to an observer it \u2018looks like\u2019 the royal family broke off their engagement with you. In that sense, gathering credit could be a way to fix things. Since Lady Euphilia is so talented, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long before word of your achievements spread.\u201d\u201cBut, if I become immersed in the cutting edge\u2026 I see, it might be hard to leave once this is all over, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure that you can understand without me spelling it out, but to put it literally, \u201cthe way you see the world will totally change\u201d. However\u2026 are you willing to still go along with this, despite knowing the risks? I have to ask you once more; are you serious? Do you understand what you\u2019re getting into?\u201d\u201cWhy does it sound like your assessment of me is getting worse and worse? Actually, this feels less like personal evaluation, and more like you\u2019re treating me as a dangerous substance?!\u201d\u201cI see you\u2019re up, Your Highness.\u201dEuphilia thought to herself as she began to understand. That, in truth, there was more to Anne-Sophia\u2019s \u2018strangeness\u2019 than she first realized.Anne-Sophia was someone that could transform the world around her. As for the person herself, the way she saw and interacted with the world was completely unique to anyone else she had ever met.This was a point of no return. Once she crossed that line, there would be no going back. She couldn\u2019t return to life the way it was before. In essence, that was Illya\u2019s warning.\u201c\u2026Princess Anne-Sophia.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t quite know why you would be willing to go so far for me, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I like you as a woman.\u201d\u201cAh, right\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can agree with that part, but I understand. Instead, Your Highness, just why do you pursue magical research like this? What end are you trying to achieve in all this?\u201dJust what is Magicology in the first place?It brought benefits that could transform the world as she knew it, but it could also serve as a truly addictive vice for humanity.The two girls saw the world through a different lens and the two girls approached life in different ways. So, just where was the Princess\u2019 path leading?Euphilia didn\u2019t have the answer to that question. When she tried to fathom the answer, she felt like she was staring into an abyss.And, after mulling it over a bit, the abyss known as Anne-Sophia stared back and answered Euphilia\u2019s question.\u201cYou know that I can\u2019t use normal magic, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOne of my earliest memories is when I thought to myself \u2018I wonder if I can fly using magic?\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dPeople weren\u2019t meant to fly in the sky. Nature intended them to walk the earth with their two feet planted on solid ground. That was obvious, since people don\u2019t have wings.So, Euphilia couldn\u2019t understand why Anne-Sophia would have such thoughts.\u201cBut, even if I talk about flying in the sky, it\u2019s not quite that simple since there\u2019s lots of things that fly, right? For example, birds and insects fly in different ways, and you even have things like flower seedlings that float on the air. And, if I decided that I wanted to float indefinitely in the air, then that would require a completely different line of thinking.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 huh\u2026?\u201d\u201cAhh, how do I put this\u2026 I honestly thought that people should be able to do much more with magic. Especially since I can\u2019t use it myself. It just feels like a huge waste, you know?\u201d\u201cA\u2026 waste\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. A waste.\u201d\u201c\u2026And, that\u2019s the reason\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dBecause she felt like it was a waste. Euphilia could feel that headache creeping back into her skull.That\u2019s all that she had to say? With just that simple motivation, she started to change the world? Ah, but, if one considers that she was looking at a completely different world to Euphilia, it begins to make sense.Perhaps it\u2019s something that Anne-Sophia could see, plain as day. When you\u2019re dealing with someone so different , it\u2019s useless to assume that anything seems impossible or ludicrous in their eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste not to use what\u2019s there, right? And it just so happens that I knew a method that could make things work my way. Ah, you probably already know, but I should mention that my innate magical power is top class! Just because I can\u2019t use my magic the normal way like everyone else, it\u2019s only normal to figure out a way to imitate and surpass it in a way that I can use, right? So, because I could do it, I did.\u201dAhh, finally, Euphilia understood the true depths of her eccentricity.It\u2019s because this was all to her. Simply changing and shaping the world around her into an image she saw fit, that was all as natural as waking up and getting dressed in the morning. What a terrifying way of viewing the world. But, she understood that, in effect, it had turned out to benefit many people.\u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it. I wanted to do it, so I did, that\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really are a frightening person, aren\u2019t you, Princess Anne-Sophia?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re much more scary to me though, Miss Euphilia? Unless you think that being armed with a super powerful family, genius-level academics, mastery of all magical elements and excellent martial arts skills is normal? You\u2019re like some kind of noble lady Einstein.\u201d\u201cEins\u2026? I don\u2019t quite understand what you mean by that last part, but I suppose I understand what you mean by the rest of it\u2026?\u201dOminous, isn\u2019t that what Illya said earlier? Euphilia smiled to herself. The way this person looked at the world, she felt like she\u2019d never quite be able to understand it.She began to empathize with Algard a little bit, when he had mentioned to her how much he hated Anne-Sophia. If Anne-Sophia had been like this since the beginning, just what could Algard have thought, having to grow up alongside her?She was sure that he must have felt the same way. That is, a feeling of fear, a feeling that one should run far away. The idea of being sucked into her world was terrifying. A world that she could change to her whims just as easily as she drew breath.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d be super glad if you help me out, Miss Euphilia. If you can lend me your aptitude for all the forms of magic, then I\u2019ll be able to expand the range of my experiments. Without you, I don\u2019t know if I can make it work.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 really do need my help?\u201d\u201cIt could help out the country as well. Or, rather, it will. That\u2019s part of why I can do what I like, after all. I can do whatever I want, so long as it can change the country.\u201dRight? Anne-Sophia seemed to say with a smile. She said that innocently, just like she was talking about normal future plans.\u201cSo, Miss Euphilia, if you ever want to join me I\u2019ll welcome you with open arms. Why don\u2019t we change the world together? As for the future where we don\u2019t, let\u2019s kick it to the curb!\u201dShe spoke with the voice of an angel, but Euphilia felt a chill run up her spine all the same, as if the devil had whispered in her ear.The strangest, most eccentric person in the Kingdom. The pioneer of Magicology, and a person who was changing the world.On that day, even if she would rather have been a hundred miles away, Euphilia Magneta came to understand the type of person Anne-Sophia von Palletia truly was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFour Party Talks Concerning the Duke\u2019s Daughter (Part 1)The day after her engagement with Algard was canceled, Euphilia, after spending the night in the royal villa, was dressed by a team of maids from the royal palace.She\u2019d already been told that she would be meeting the King today, as well as her father, Duke Grantz Magneta, who had arrived at the palace. The servants had been busy preparing her since this morning, and it was already noon.Even though she was being dressed up in a way that wouldn\u2019t shame her in front of royalty, Euphilia still couldn\u2019t shake off her somber mood. The only thing she could think of was that strict father of hers.(I wonder if he\u2019ll even worry about seeming civil when he sees me\u2026)Although Anne-Sophia herself had said that her father loved her, Euphilia couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe it.As far as she was concerned, he didn\u2019t see her as a daughter, only as a future Queen, someone to become a leading figure for the country\u2019s next generation. No matter how much she tried, that idea remained unassailable in her mind.If one aims to become Queen, one must be able to cut down opponents without mercy or hesitation. One mustn\u2019t throw aside their feelings, but they mustn\u2019t be fettered by them. One must be just for the sake of the country, sincere for the sake of the people. That was what had lain ahead for her in the future.Without being able to use those teachings and that goal to prop herself up any longer, Euphilia felt as weak and vulnerable as any girl her age in a situation like this would. Without trying to hide her melancholy, she looked out the window.\u201cCatch the Princess at once! Don\u2019t let her get away, after her!\u201d\u201cDoes she have her flying tool with her?! Alright, quickly, surround and corner her!\u201d\u201cRoyal Knights, spare no effort! We must protect the peace of mind of His Majesty!\u201d\u201cWE ARE HIS MAJESTY\u2019S SHIELD!!\u201d\u201cWell said, now begin the assault! Chaaaaaaaaarge !!\u201d\u201cORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\u201d\u201cFollow the knights! As Her Highness\u2019 personal maids corps, we cannot be left behind! Onwards, everyone!\u201d\u201cAT ONCE!!\u201d\u2026And watched a chaotic scene with a small army of knights and maids rushing about.What\u2019s more, she definitely heard the Princess mentioned more than once. Euphilia couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was going on this time.\u201cHahahahaha! This way, knights! Follow the sound of my clapping!\u201d\u201cPrepare thyself, Princess Anne-Sophia!\u201d\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re meant to be meeting with His Majesty and His Excellency Duke Magneta, you must get changed into a dress at once!\u201d\u201cI refuseee! I\u2019ll dress how I like, thank you very much!!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a requeeeeest!!\u201dAs she watched, the country\u2019s Princess hopped between the ground and the walls to evade her pursuers, like she was some kind of human grasshopper. And as she jumped around in a strange way, the horde of knights and maids raced after her, creating the strangest sort of scene.\u201cHahahaaa! Well then, my dear knights and maids, please do excuse meeee!\u201d\u201cThis is bad, is she going to scale the walls?!\u201d\u201cPlease wait, Your Highness!\u201d\u201cA Princess waits for no man!\u201d\u201c\u2026In that case, I\u2019ll stop you by force.\u201d\u201cA head hunter?!\u201dJumping down from the top of the ramparts, Illya descended like a grim reaper towards Anne-Sophia, who was running up the side of the wall.As they both plummeted into the ground a plume of dust exploded into the air, eventually clearing to reveal Illya pinning Anne-Sophia to the ground.\u201cNow! Don\u2019t worry about getting me caught up in it!!\u201d\u201cIllya\u2026 Your sacrifice will never be forgotten! Maid corps, get her!!\u201d\u201cLeave it to us\u2026! Prepare yourself, Princeeeess!!\u201d\u201cDamn you\u2026 Damn yooooou!\u201dAnne-Sophia struggled with all her might as the ropes were cast over her. Meanwhile, Illya closed her eyes and accepted her fate as collateral damage, as she was bound up together with Anne-Sophia and carted away by a group of knights. As the maid corps were hot on their heels, the rest of the knights let out a victory cry.After watching the absurd scene play out in silence, Euphilia let out a sigh.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could I have a cup of tea?\u201dShe decided that she would do her utmost to keep herself from seeing any more.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u201cGood day, Princess Anne-Sophia. Your dress looks wonderful.\u201d\u201cGood day, Miss Euphilia. That\u2019s what all the maids have been saying since this morning\u2026 That I look good in it, but\u2026\u201dEuphilia studied the dressed up Anne-Sophia. She stood somewhat shorter than her and combined, with that young looking face of hers, any stranger would have trouble believing that Euphilia was the younger of the two.Just like she thought, that skin of hers positively glowed after some care, and that platinum blonde hair that signified the royal family looked glossy and beautiful, woven into an intricate braid. That light pink dress with a fluffy hem was a perfect fit for Anne-Sophia\u2019s youthful looks as well.If she stayed completely still, and Euphilia erased what she had seen the day before and that morning from her memories, she could almost pass as a normal, beautiful princess. Though considering how beautiful she was when properly scrubbed up and prepared, Euphilia thought to herself that no matter what happened, she wouldn\u2019t ever be able to forget that she was a royal.Compared to Anne-Sophia, Euphilia had a more feminine look. In particular, her waistline was something that would make others sigh with envy. Although she was fairly modestly built in the chest area, it was the perfect size to balance out the rest of her slender and tall body.Euphilia\u2019s hair was a light shade of silver, that could almost be mistaken for being white. Under the light, it almost sparkled, it was that lustrous. Along with her lady-like pale skin and pink eyes, although her strong will often left a marked impression on people, nobody could deny her good looks. Simply put, Euphilia was a beauty.\u201cDresses are so heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease bear with it for now.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, Lady Euphilia, His Majesty and His Excellency are awaiting you.\u201dWith a bow, the maid lead Anne-Sophia and Euphilia into the next room. In the room, sitting opposite to Orfans, was a man whose features were reminiscent of Euphilia\u2019s.Just like Euphilia\u2019s, his sharp eyes left no mistake about the strength of his willpower, and his cold expression betrayed no emotions. A man whose entire being felt like it had been sharpened akin to a blade, he was none other than Duke Grantz Magneta.\u201cIt has been some time since we last met, Lord Grantz.\u201d\u201cPrincess Anne-Sophia, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you once again. You truly have grown up to be a wondrous beauty.\u201d\u201cGrown up\u2026 Oh, my Lord, you really do have a charming tongue. Almost like a Princess\u2019s!\u201d\u201cWho the hell is supposed to be the Princess here, you idiot girl?! Just hurry up and take a seat. Euphilia, if you would as well, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, please excuse me.\u201dAs Anne-Sophia and her father sat next to each other, their usual mood continuing straight from where it had left off the previous day, the mood between Euphilia and Grantz stood in stark contrast, feeling cold and mechanical. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Euphilia bowed and took a seat next to Grantz.After Anne-Sophia and Euphilia were settled in their seats, Orfans coughed and started them off.\u201cI believe we all know why we\u2019ve gathered here today. First of all, I would like to confirm some details about just what occurred leading up to and during the cancellation of the engagement by Algard. Euphilia, I realize this must be hard, but could I ask you to speak on it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Your Majesty.\u201dAfter being prompted by Orfans, Euphilia began to relay the story. Whilst listening to Euphilia explain what had happened, Orfans\u2019 face began to grow darker.In contrast, Grantz\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all. He merely listened to what his daughter had to say impassively. Whilst occasionally taking brief pauses to wet her drying throat with a sip of tea, Euphilia eventually finished telling the entire story.\u201c\u2026I see now. So, after breaking into the banquet hall accidentally, you took Euphilia away from there, is that correct, Princess Anne-Sophia?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAnd, out of consideration for what will inevitably happen to her reputation, you\u2019ve extended an offer to Euphilia to research magic under you?\u201d\u201cOnly with your permission, of course.\u201dAfter listening to what Anne-Sophia also had to say, Grantz stroked his chin. As always, his expression was indiscernible, like staring at a sheet of ice.Orfans, meanwhile, shuffled restlessly in his seat, preemptively stroking his stomach. Euphilia\u2019s shoulders had begun to tremble, her hands gripping her knees.Meanwhile, the eccentric princess lived up to her moniker as she casually sat through that tense atmosphere, taking a relaxed sip of tea.\u201cUntil now, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you have never directly involved anyone in your magical research before, is that right, Your Highness? So, why now?\u201d\u201cIs me liking Miss Euphilia not enough of a reason?\u201d\u201cIf you would, I would like to hear the real reason.\u201d\u201cWell, we both like each other, right? Isn\u2019t that good enough?\u201dFor the first time in the meeting, Grantz smiled. But, it was a smile like a predator that had prey in its sights. Anne-Sophia, meanwhile, grinned like a Cheshire Cat.\u201cTo put it simply, Miss Euphilia knows what it feels like to be hurt. So, I don\u2019t think I have to worry about her betraying me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Betraying\u2026 you\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean to say is that magic is dangerous, Miss Euphilia.\u201dAs she listened to the words she never expected to leave Anne-Sophia\u2019s mouth, the Princess turned and grinned coyly at Euphilia.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aMagic is dangerous. Or, at least, that\u2019s what I think.That\u2019s why, even if I do submit my research papers and reports from time to time, I don\u2019t let anyone see the inner workings of my research process, apart from Illya.I\u2019ve taken great pains to make sure that all the other maids are kept far away from my workshop. So, apart from me, there are only a handful of people who even understand a part of the research and development process behind Magicology.\u201cThe more research I complete, the more convenient and useful my brand of magic becomes. Making things convenient allows civilizations to prosper, and that prosperity eventually becomes something that can be wielded. In other words, right, it becomes what you could call power.\u201d\u201cPower\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. So, I try to keep as much of my research under wraps as possible, and don\u2019t give out more of this \u2018power\u2019 than I need to. It\u2019s fine to use these things for myself, but I\u2019m very careful about what I allow to spread to the wider world. And, I try to make sure as few people are involved as possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, it was because you foresaw what kind of influence Magicology could have that you gave up your right to the throne?\u201dEuphilia didn\u2019t quite seem to understand, so I explained what I meant. After I did, this time it was Lord Grantz who asked a quiet question.\u201cNo, that\u2019s more because the right to succeed the throne was a pain in the aAAAAGH?!\u201dBefore I could finish my sentence, Father\u2019s hand smacked the top of my head. That was dangerous, I almost bit my tongue. Wincing at the pain, I rubbed the top of my head.Part of the reason I gave up my right to inheritance really was that it was an annoying bother, though. Because, in the end, \u2018my\u2019 values had irreversibly changed, and I was eventually convinced that they would never go back to what they were, even if I stayed in that position.\u201cAll I wanted to do was study Magicology. That, and I didn\u2019t want to get married to anyone.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cBecause then I\u2019d have to balance work and kids, right?! I DEFINITELY don\u2019t want to have any children! And also, I don\u2019t hate men, but when it comes to a partner I have ZERO interest in the opposite sex!\u201d\u201c\u2026So, it really was true, after all?\u201dYeah. Honestly, I really can\u2019t see it. I can\u2019t imagine myself being in line for the throne now at all. It\u2019s not as if I completely hate the idea, okay? It\u2019s just so low down my list of priorities it may as well not exist.If I continued to proclaim my right to succeed the throne and actually achieve it, if I tried to keep going with my magical research, things could get sticky very quickly. I didn\u2019t really think about it too deeply back then, but that\u2019s something I slowly came to realize later.\u201cIf I continue to contest the right to inherit the throne, it could become a real problem for the country.\u201d\u201cJust why do you say that?\u201d\u201cMiss Euphilia, just what do you think is valuable about me? It\u2019s my Magicology. But, say I did somehow become Queen, then I\u2019d have to do my magical research alongside all my duties as a leader! I\u2019d have no choice but to choose one or the other. So, would I leave affairs of state to my husband? Wouldn\u2019t that just make me a puppet head of state? In other words, in order for me to keep devoting my time to making my Magicology a success, I have to give up on the right to inherit the throne!\u201dIf I actually became a Queen, I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid dealing with affairs of state. So, I\u2019d have to cut down on the time spent on Magicology. The problem is, apart from my magical research, I\u2019m not really good at anything else. Besides, I really don\u2019t think I could be trusted with a wallet as big as a national treasury.If I ended up becoming Queen, I\u2019d probably get so frustrated I\u2019d blow my top eventually. But, if I leave all my duties to whoever I ended up marrying, the schism of power would eventually lead to factions cropping up and dividing the country.\u201cAfter that, father began to suggest I be married off for political reasons, but belonging to some man was totally no good either. That would mean he\u2019d hold the power of Magicology, right? The power of Magicology being wielded like that could end up being really dangerous. I didn\u2019t want to get wrapped up in something that troublesome anyways, and like I said before, marrying a man is totally no good in the first place!\u201d\u201cSo dedicated\u2026\u201dAs if he felt a headache coming on, Father touched his forehead. Well, of course, I\u2019m dedicated! Like I\u2019ll let anything get in the way of my fun second life!\u201cThat\u2019s why I stepped back so that Allie could be the next King! And I went a little wild to help seal the deal!\u201d\u201cOh, Anise, did you truly act with such feelings in mind?\u201d\u201cWell, not really, it just sort of ended up that way.\u201d\u201cI knew iiit!!\u201dFather looks like he\u2019s grieving. But, well, all\u2019s well that ends well, right?\u201cHowever, that plan seems to have backfired.\u201d\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dLord Grantz muttered coldly. Father, meanwhile, groaned like he was in pain. Well, I suppose that\u2019s right, huh? With Allie acting out like this, the whole house of cards seems like it\u2019s teetering.It\u2019s also probably true that, since I was so free, a lot more scrutiny was placed on Allie. Maybe. I\u2019m sorry about that, really sorry.Well, even if I profited by having the opportunity to approach Miss Euphilia, it\u2019s not like it didn\u2019t come at a cost for most people involved, so there\u2019s no way I could say that out loud. Especially since the fault for this incident lay squarely on our, the royal family\u2019s, shoulders.\u201cSo, in brief, Princess Anne-Sophia, your plan is to restore Euphilia\u2019s reputation by having her participate in your Magicology research?\u201d\u201cYes. To be blunt, I don\u2019t think it would work out if I tried to butt into Allie\u2019s affairs. Allie doesn\u2019t really see eye to eye with me lately. So, with that in mind, I figured it would be better to bring her over to my side instead.\u201d\u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t a bad idea. In the sense that it would be of great benefit to Princess Anne-Sophia\u2019s magical research, that is\u2026 However, just how would it benefit my house?\u201dWith those words, the pressure exuding from Lord Grantz increased dramatically. I could feel Father wilting slightly beside me.It was definitely possible to fix Miss Euphilia\u2019s reputation, but, what would all this mean for how people viewed her family? Just like I said earlier, letting someone in on my research presented all sorts of risks.If it was a family like Duke Magneta\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t worry about them abusing the knowledge. But, a new problem would emerge in that people would perceive them as having too much power.\u201cI doubt I should have to explain to you just what I mean to say by that, Princess Anne-Sophia, as you have said it yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYet, despite that, you would still wish to bring Euphilia to your side?\u201d\u201cYes. Because I wish for her to be happy. And for her potential to fade away now would be too much of a shame. If anything, I want to help unlock her true potential.\u201dPersonally, I don\u2019t like the idea of a monarchy. Someone has to kill their own individuality and become a living embodiment of the state. But, so long as this country remains a kingdom, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do about that. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m capable of or willing to change.But, that doesn\u2019t mean I personally have to go along with it. I want to live as I like. From the day I regained my memories, I became wholly unfit to sit on a throne.Well, I won\u2019t deny that there are certain things that are easier because I\u2019m a Princess, and I don\u2019t have any complaints about making contributions to the country. But, if I have to stop being me, then I never want to become a Queen.However, I knew that my selfishness meant that someone else would have to suffer in my place. And, that was plain to see in what Miss Euphilia was having to go through. So, I want to do everything I can for her.\u201c\u2026I see. Euphilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Father.\u201d\u201cDo you still wish to become a Queen?\u201d\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aAs her father asked her that, she looked back at him, but she couldn\u2019t muster any strength to back up her gaze. Her shoulders trembled, and she chewed her lip as she tried to form words.Grantz, meanwhile, simply looked at Euphilia. Seconds felt like hours, but finally Euphilia opened her mouth to speak, as tears spilled down her cheeks.\u201cI\u2019m so\u2026 truly sorry\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you apologizing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I dragged our family\u2019s name\u2026 through the mud\u2026! I will do everything I can to clean it\u2026 but\u2026 I can\u2019t become a Queen\u2026 anymore\u2026!\u201dHer voice was racked with intermittent sobs. Euphilia\u2019s entire body shook as she put everything into her words, desperately trying to wipe away the tears that stained her dress.Grantz\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he listened to her, as if he wasn\u2019t pleased with her answer.\u201cEuphilia, I will ask you once again. Do you still want to become a Queen?\u201d\u201cI cannot become one\u2026\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking whether you could or could not. I am asking whether you want to be one.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t become one! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so sorry\u2026!\u201dShaking her head vigorously, Euphilia repeated the same words. Grantz\u2019s eyes stayed narrowed as he looked at his daughter.\u201cAh, yeah, uh\u2026 Lord Grantz, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite putting it right. Miss Euphilia, you\u2019re not really answering like you\u2019re meant to, either.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026?\u201dAnne-Sophia, who was scratching the side of her cheek awkwardly, interjected between the two of them.\u201cWho said you couldn\u2019t be one, exactly? Lord Grantz is asking you what you would like to do, Miss Euphilia. But, you\u2019re answering him like someone else has made the decision for you. That\u2019s why Lord Grantz was asking you to answer him differently, right?\u201dAnne-Sophia turned from Euphilia and directed her question at Grantz. Grantz paid Anne-Sophia a single glance, before turning back to his daughter.\u201cEuphilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cI raised you to become a Queen, so I wanted to see if you still held the resolution to become one. However\u2026 If you don\u2019t want to do that, then\u2026\u201dWhat happened next caused Euphilia\u2019s eyes to go wide from shock.Grantz reached out his hand\u2026 and stroked her head. With slightly clumsy fingers, Grantz ran a hand through Euphilia\u2019s hair.\u201cWe will end it. The engagement that the King suggested, if you decide that you don\u2019t wish for it anymore, then I shall respect that.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo matter who wants to make you into a Queen, if you don\u2019t want that, then I\u2019ll protect you with every fiber of my being. Euphilia, I want you to be happy. Up until now\u2026 I haven\u2019t been the sort of Father you deserve.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true at all\u2026! It\u2019s only because of how you raised me that I\u2019ve come this far at all, Father! Please don\u2019t say something like that! It\u2019s all my fault for being so foolish and bringing shame on our family\u2026!\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single foolish thing about my daughter. But\u2026 so be it, if you can\u2019t forgive yourself, then I\u2019ll forgive you in your place. The family I lead isn\u2019t so small a thing to be toppled over by some small mistake of my daughter.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say something like that\u2026 Just why are you saying this, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201dEuphilia\u2019s voice was barely a whisper as the tears continued to fall.Ever since she was a young girl, her future as the fiancee of the Prince had been determined for her. It was what had driven her forward, inspired her to become someone worthy of the position.She had given it everything she had. If she was to be the country\u2019s Queen, she could never burden anyone with her own selfishness. In order to lead the country alongside the King, she had to become smarter and stronger than all the rest.So, the words her father spoke rang strangely in her ears. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do as she liked, to act on her own desires. As confusion boiled in her chest, Euphilia hugged herself tight, as if the wall that had kept heart safe would shatter and disappear if she didn\u2019t.\u201cSo, please tell me that I was wrong\u2026 That it was my fault that I couldn\u2019t stop Prince Algard because of my own uselessness, that I was too weak to overturn the accusations, otherwise, I\u2019ll\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re acting just like a little girl, Euphie.\u201dEuphie \u2026? A nostalgic memory that she thought long forgotten stirred in her mind. And, when she raised her head, she saw Grantz\u2019s troubled smile.Ahh, now she remembered. That\u2019s what her Father used to call her, wasn\u2019t it? Such a nostalgic sound. From a time before she became the fiancee to a Prince, when he was just his daughter.\u201cIt\u2019s as if you haven\u2019t grown at all. As if, on that day, time had just come to a stop. You were still my little Euphie, you always have been, but I just failed to notice. As a father, I\u2019m pathetic.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cI taught you every day how to carry yourself with beauty and grace, because I imagined that one day you would carry the country on your shoulders, so I was strict with you since I didn\u2019t want you to see you fall to the hardships that awaited you in the future. But, all I was doing was coating you in armour, I didn\u2019t pay attention to what lay underneath. What a pathetic father I am\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t say that. Even if you\u2019re the one saying them, I can\u2019t listen to any words that degrade you, Father!\u201d\u201cThen, please tell this miserable excuse of a father, who couldn\u2019t even notice the pain his daughter was going through\u2026 Do you still hold the hope of becoming a Queen, Euphie?\u201dHe reached out a hand to stroke Euphilia\u2019s cheek, wiping away the tears. Reaching out, Euphilia took his hand in hers.His clumsily big, but warm hands. It felt just like the hand of her father\u2019s that she remembered as a child. And, as she held it, the stubborn wall that she had put around her heart finally yielded.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Father. But, I can no longer stand by Prince Algard\u2019s side. I have\u2026 no wish to become Queen anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so sorry for wasting all of the efforts that you\u2019ve been making up until now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Euphie, the only thing that I wish for is that you can smile, truly smile, from the bottom of your heart. You really did your best. And I\u2019m sorry it took me this long to notice. I\u2019m sorry, Euphie.\u201dGrantz pulled Euphilia into a deep hug. Euphilia, drawn into her father\u2019s embrace, buried her face in his chest and began to wail.Looking warmly at his daughter, Grantz gently stroked her back to comfort her.\u201cOhh, what a moment, Father! Don\u2019t you think this atmosphere is really great! Look at those two, it\u2019s like they\u2019re in their own little world!\u201d\u201cYooooooooooou! Even in this kind of moment, you wouuuuuld??!!\u201d\u201cMy neck! My neck should be off limits! Father, it\u2019s hard to breaaathe! Referee, where\u2019s the referee?! I give, I give!! Ahh don\u2019t squeeze even mooore?!\u201dWith one hand, Orfans wiped away a tear, truly feeling sorry for everything that had lead up to this moment. With the other, he gripped his idiot daughter\u2019s throat.As Anne-Sophia struggled in Orfans\u2019 grasp, she slammed her fists against his arms as she slowly went pale.As the royal duo began to get noisy again, Grantz and Euphilia turned to look at them, then turned back to look at each other.And, as if to say \u2018what a bother\u2019, the two of them exchanged a small smile.Extra: In the light novel, there\u2019s a scene where Euphie and Anise share a bed for that night and talk about themselves. Unfortunately, plot-wise, it doesn\u2019t fit with the way the web novel is written, so I\u2019ve excluded it. I can, however, share the illustration:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFour Party Talks Concerning the Duke\u2019s Daughter (Part 2)\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m sure that you still mean to have words with Prince Algard about this situation, but no matter what the result of that may be, I would request that you make the annulment of his engagement with Euphie official.\u201d\u201cI will make it so, so please raise your head, Grantz.\u201dOnce Euphilia had calmed down, Grantz had turned to bow down low to Orfans.Once Grantz raised his head, Orfans looked on with a bitter expression.\u201c\u2026Algard has certainly caused no end of trouble. Truth be told, I do not know if there\u2019s anything I can say to make this right. The only thing I can do now is to do the same myself. I\u2019m sorry about all of this, Grantz, Euphilia.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty! Even if it\u2019s just us here, you mustn\u2019t lower your head\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Orfans. Could you please not trouble Euphie like that?\u201d\u201cSometimes, I need to act as a person, not as a King. Honestly though, being a father, is it really worth it? Really, it\u2019s tough. Daughters especially.\u201dOrfans and Grantz shared a laugh, as Anne-Sophia rubbed her sore neck.Euphilia couldn\u2019t help but stare in surprise as her father laughed, it was as if she were seeing an entirely new side of him today, or at the very least, a side she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201cSo, Princess Anne-Sophia. I have no qualms with leaving Euphilia in your care. That is, if Euphilia agrees of course, and you also agree to my conditions.\u201d\u201cYes! \u2026Yes? Conditions?\u201dThe smile that had spread to her lips as she heard those first magic words quickly faded as she mulled over the word \u2018conditions\u2019, tilting her head.Putting back on a face more befitting of a Duke, Grantz sat upright. That warm expression he had share with Euphilia just moments ago had returned to that ice-cold mask as he looked at Anne-Sophia.\u201cIf you want me to agree to leaving Euphilia under your care, then I would ask that Her Highness reasserts her claim to the throne.\u201d\u201c Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ?!\u201dAnne-Sophia cried out in shock at Grantz\u2019s words. Her mouth hung open, looking at Grantz as if she couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.Sitting next to her, Orfans raised an eyebrow.\u201cWhat are your intentions behind this, Grantz?\u201d\u201cIf things continue as is, there is a chance that Prince Algard may not succeed the throne.\u201d\u201cWhy?!\u201dAnne-Sophia blurted that out at Grantz, who didn\u2019t seem to be fazed by her shout at all.\u201cI have doubts about his credentials as a ruler, whilst I have no doubts about your competency, Your Highness. If you were properly , then you could certainly be a proper royal.\u201d\u201cNo way no way, it\u2019s impossible! Did you suddenly go blind, Lord Grantz?!\u201d\u201cCertainly, as you are now, your behaviour and mannerisms leave much to be desired for a member of the royal family, Princess Anne-Sophia. However, that\u2019s if one only views that through the lens of the country\u2019s system.\u201d\u201cJust what are you after, Grantz?\u201d\u201cOrfans, don\u2019t you think it would be interesting to see what this strange daughter of yours would do as Queen?\u201d\u201c HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ?!\u201dA second full-blown scream. Anne-Sophia stared bug-eyed at Grantz, as if he\u2019d gone mad. Even Euphilia couldn\u2019t help but stare as she heard a proposal she\u2019d never have expected her father to make.\u201cAre you serious? Did you lose your mind? Why? Why? Lord Grantz, what did I ever do to you?! Why are you trying to subject me to this kind of cruel and unusual punishment?!\u201d\u201cI merely have the country\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d\u201cIf you put me in charge, then the country will be ruined, you know?! No no no, this is totally and completely a huge no!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I will put Euphilia by your side. By staying by Princess Anne-Sophia\u2019s side, Euphilia will come to understand Magicology, whilst Euphilia can manage affairs of state by utilizing the education she received as a potential future Queen.\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is totally crazy?!\u201dIt really was crazy. Even Anne-Sophia, who was the definition of crazy for a lot of people, couldn\u2019t help but think what Grantz was saying was absurd. But, Grantz didn\u2019t seem perturbed.\u201cWell, that\u2019s only a hypothetical, of course.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah. So, you meant that I should act like a stalking horse for Allie?\u201dAnne-Sophia slapped a fist into her palm as if she suddenly realized, whilst Grantz nodded to a much more appeased looking Princess.\u201cEven if Your Highness were to reassert her right to succession, you would still be second in line to the throne. As the eldest son, Prince Algard would still hold primogeniture.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s true? If you follow the law, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cHowever, Princess Anne-Sophia, you\u2019re hardly one known for following the law.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, don\u2019t act like it\u2019s a foregone conclusion?! I told you, it\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cHowever, if Prince Algard is disinherited, then there truly will need to be someone in reserve? If the Prince is deemed to be unworthy, then the throne will naturally pass along to you, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to do Allie in?! Actually, wait, are you trying to form a faction to do Allie in, is that it?! No way, you want me to be the figurehead for your faction as well?! Has that been your goal all along?!\u201dAll Anne-Sophia wanted to do was study Magicology and enjoy the fruits of her research. The main reason she had chosen to stay in the royal family was that it was a good way to prevent the results of her studies from being misused. If there hadn\u2019t been any danger, she\u2019d always thought it would\u2019ve been nice to leave the palace and settle down in the countryside.Well, she probably wouldn\u2019t do that anyway, since it would\u2019ve upset her parents too much. So, in order not to agitate Algard she\u2019d always made a big song and dance about how she wasn\u2019t interested in the throne. But, whilst she considered her accomplishments molehills in regards to the successorship, Algard had seen them as mountains.\u201c\u2026Hmm, so that\u2019s your aim. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a poor plan at all, Anise.\u201d\u201cHa? Father, are you finally going senile? Please, don\u2019t say such desperate things! You\u2019re the most important pillar of the country! If something happens to you, who would the people look to?!!\u201d\u201cKahh! Were you just born to test my fist\u2019s patience?! Can you reflect on yourself just once?!\u201dAnne-Sophia\u2019s panic deepened as Orfans began to raise his hand, but smacking her upside the head right now wouldn\u2019t solve anything.Trying to settle himself, he reached out instead and rang the small bell on the table, calling in a maid to serve fresh tea. After the tea was served and the maid left the room, Orfans turned again to talk to Anne-Sophia.\u201cOh, Anise, you certainly are the Kingdom\u2019s most problematic child, and the chief agitator of the Royal Solar Plexus.\u201d\u201cWhat an awful set of titles? Well, I\u2019m fine with them, though. Please, go on.\u201d\u201cHowever, deep down in your being, I know you have a good heart and keen sense\u2026 To tell you the honest truth, amongst the retainers, you are more popular than Algard is, Anise.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dAnne-Sophia\u2019s eyes widened like a rabbit suddenly hit by a crossbow bolt.Whilst staring at his stunned looking daughter, Orfans suppressed a sigh as he rubbed his forehead and continued.\u201cYou certainly have your\u2026 problematic qualities. However, it is believed that you would also have the necessary pluck and spirit to properly deal with a crisis situation, should one arise. There\u2019s also a certain view that you aren\u2019t truly out to hurt anyone, and that the goal for your research has always been to improve the lives of the people. In short, you\u2019re a problem child, but one that should be evaluated further.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m really just doing whatever I want, though\u2026 It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m doing it for anyone e- Uh, yes, sure, right. And?\u201dOrfans\u2019 eyes grew stern as he held his tongue for a moment. Anne-Sophia shifted backwards slightly, trying to read his mood. After a cough, Orfans continued.\u201cIf you become serious about competing for the throne, you\u2019ll find that there are people ready to take up your banner.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 HUH ?! Wait, then you\u2019re serious about making me Allie\u2019s stalking horse, Father?!\u201d\u201cIf having a true rival inspires Algard to steady and cultivate himself, then all is well. If not, then I shall endeavour instead to finally tie a rope around your neck and rein you in. The two worst-case scenarios, either Algard becoming an incompetent king or the Kingdom being left with no successor, I will not allow either to happen.\u201d\u201cTie a rope around my neck, doesn\u2019t that sound like you\u2019re gonna kill me?! Ah, wait, you wanna keep me like a pet?! Like livestock, is that it?!\u201dOrfans stared seriously at his daughter, whilst Anne-Sophia, on the other hand, showed a rare look of genuine terror.\u201cNo way, no way no waaaaaaaaaaaaay! Me, A Queen?! Seriously?! My apologies, I\u2019m not interested in what you\u2019re selling. Well then, please have a lovely day, I\u2019ll be going.\u201d\u201cWe are not finished talking.\u201d\u201cPah! Well, whatever, so long as Miss Euphilia refuses then none of this matters, right?!\u201d\u201cOho? You were talking of what you wished to do for my daughter before, but now that push has come to shove, you\u2019re going to abandon Euphie so easily\u2026?\u201d\u201cEt tu, Lord Grantz\u2026?!\u201dGrantz\u2019s eyes were dead serious. Anne-Sophia, who had faced down the killing intent of monsters many times before, flinched as she saw a vision of death in his eyes.\u201cWhilst I wish for Euphie\u2019s happiness, of course, I am still a Duke. If Prince Algard is proven to be an unsalvageable option, then I won\u2019t hesitate to take the next necessary step.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! If Father just has another baby\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou expect your mother to give birth at her age?\u201d\u201cAh, no, I mean\u2026 no. Anyways, no matter what, I hate it. I unconditionally refuse. There\u2019s absolutely no chance! There\u2019s no way that I can be a Queen!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what Euphie is there for, no matter what you do, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhh! So this is what Illya felt when I had the moat filled! I\u2019ve never felt like this before and I haaaaaaate it!!\u201dAnne-Sophia cried into her hands. The right to contest the throne that she thought that she\u2019d abandoned in the woods long ago had suddenly just knocked on her door to say hello. Along with a whole load of baggage. Ahh, how could this happen?! God is dead! Anne-Sophia seethed to herself as she thought that.Euphilia could barely keep up, so she just watched on silently. Anne-Sophia moaned and murmured to herself for a while, then suddenly took her face out of her hands and sat up bolt straight.Euphilia couldn\u2019t help but be surprised by the sudden switch, since when she stared at Anne-Sophia now, it was as if she was a different person to how she was a few seconds beforehand.\u201cAnd, so, how long will the grace period be?\u201d\u201cBy a grace period, I assume you mean in regards to Prince Algard?\u201d\u201cYes. Father, Lord Grantz, I would like to know how long a period of time you are allowing Algard to correct himself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Two years. However, if something serious happens again within the next year, I will not hesitate to take away his right of succession.\u201d\u201cIn other words, we should know where we stand after roughly one year, is that it? Judging by that amount of time, I\u2019m guessing that you don\u2019t want to be seen as too aggressively breaking old customs, correct?\u201d\u201cOf course. And until such a time that we can figure out whether Algard will stand or fall, I want you to remain quiet and out of the spotlight.\u201d\u201cI understand completely. I don\u2019t want the country to become full of strife either, of course. But, if I think it\u2019s necessary, then I\u2019ll be the one to drive Algard out myself. Is that fine with you? I\u2019ll have to become a despot. Otherwise, nobody will accept the old customs being broken. I\u2019m not a charitable person, if someone will stand in my way, then I\u2019m prepared to sit on a throne made from coffins. Humans can be demons if they need to be.\u201dEuphilia recoiled in shock when she saw Anne-Sophia\u2019s eyes, which were completely expressionless, as if they\u2019d been replaced by glass balls.Sitting beside the slightly trembling Euphilia, Grantz laughed heartily.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite some time since I\u2019ve seen that face.\u201d\u201cLord Grantz, you must be jesting.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always like this when the blood goes to your head, still a problem child, but in a very different way. Argh, but why did you have to flip this switch in this situation of all times\u2026?! Just why are you\u2026 so unbalanced like this?!\u201d\u201cHaaaaaaaaaa?! This is why I told you that I don\u2019t wanna do it, because I\u2019ll end up like that! No waaay! And you want to put me in a cage and keep me quiet?! Caged up like that, for a whole year?! Fine, I\u2019ll put up with this pain in the ass situation for a year, but afterwards, you have to give me a budget!\u201dImmediately switching back into acting like a child throwing a tantrum, Anne-Sophia\u2019s rigid posture broke down and she yelled back at her father. Opening her legs and sinking back into her chair, she covered her face with her hands.\u201cIf we\u2019re to hit you with the stick, I suppose it does make sense to hold out a carrot as well.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Euphie. Princess Anne-Sophia doesn\u2019t usually throw tantrums like this. However, when she does throw tantrums, she becomes a singularly useless double-edged sword, as you can thusly see. You would do well to keep this in mind from now on.\u201d\u201cY\u2026 Yes\u2026?\u201d\u201cAt any rate, this budget. You say that she never asks for any jewellery, dresses or anything of the like. Compared to the princesses of the past, wouldn\u2019t you say that she\u2019s a lot cheaper, Orfans?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the most expensive Princess in history when it comes to her father\u2019s stress levels! Ah, she has such a kind heart, however\u2026 It would be nice if she could learn to care a bit more about my poor stoma- NOWAH?!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say just now, you Father who has torn his daughter\u2019s hopes and dreams to shreds?!\u201d\u201cAs if you can talk, you idiot daughter!\u201dEuphilia felt her mouth twitching as she watched the Princess and the King fighting on the sofa.\u201cPrincess Anne-Sophia, asking merely to be allocated a budget, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re asking for too little?\u201dAs the royal pair pinched each other\u2019s cheeks whilst they tumbled, Grantz asked her that question with a straight face. Anne-Sophia stopped fighting her father and regained her composure, as she shook her head at Grantz\u2019s question.\u201cLord Grantz, the royal budget is the blood, sweat and tears of the people. It ought to be seen as the fertilizer that nourishes the country. It isn\u2019t something that should be spent or thought of frivolously.\u201d\u201cIn that case, why not ask for something other than an allocation of the budget?\u201d\u201cOther than the budget? Ehh, then, materials? But, I can just go hunting for those myself\u2026\u201dAnne-Sophia thought of what she could possibly want other than money, especially since she was the kind of person who preferred to personally collect the things that she needed herself.She didn\u2019t have anything in particular that she could ask of the country, she concluded. Well, other than being excused from this whole \u2018right to succession\u2019, thing. But she didn\u2019t even bother saying it, since she knew that it wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201cRelatedly, is that rumour true?\u201d\u201cRumour?\u201d\u201cThat you only love those of the same-sex.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Hmm, how should I put it? Certainly, when it comes to getting friendly and falling in love with someone, I\u2019d much prefer a woman. As for men, hmm, I suppose it\u2019s fine if they just want to be friends, but\u2026 It\u2019s hard to explain, but I feel my skin crawl just thinking about having a man as my partner? Like, it\u2019s physically impossible for me, it feels like. So, I suppose I avoid them just in case they say something weird or try to touch me, I guess you could say\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust listening to this is giving me a headache\u2026\u201dAs Anne-Sophia awkwardly tried to explain her preferences, Orfans rubbed his temples in exasperation.Hearing what she had to say, Grantz meanwhile tapped his chin and closed his eyes.\u201cQuite\u2026 I see\u2026 In that case, there\u2019s no need to rush. It would be a good idea to submit a request once you\u2019ve had some time to think about what you would like.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea as well. Father, are you fine with that?\u201d\u201cIt matters not to me. Anise\u2026 My apologies. Despite what I said, I know that this really is something you truly dislike.\u201d\u201cThe one I\u2019m mad at is\u2026 Allie! Ahh, I hate thiiiis! Ohh, I really hope nothing bad happens, pleaaaase!!\u201dThis side of the royal family made Euphilia\u2019s eyes glaze over slightly, as if her ideal of the monarchy she\u2019d formed in her mind was crumbling before her eyes.\u201cEuphie, you as well. Are you happy to study magicology under Princess Anne-Sophia?\u201d\u201cEh? Ah, yes. I\u2019ve actually been interested in Anne-Sophia\u2019s research since I saw some of the results of it yesterday.\u201d\u201cSo long as nothing drastic happens, Princess Anne-Sophia will be recusing herself from the spotlight for an entire year. This will be a good opportunity for you to rest for a while as well.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you very much for your considerate words.\u201dDespite the formal language, Euphilia smiled happily at her father as she thanked him. Watching Euphilia, Grantz\u2019s cold and business-like mask softened just a bit.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aOnce the meeting was over, Euphilia and Grantz sat in the carriage, returning back to their estate.Now that she\u2019d already talked to her father, Euphilia smiled at the thought of talking to her mother, who had always warmly taken care of her. Somehow, the way that Princess Anne-Sophia had fussed and worried over her had reminded her of her mother.\u201c\u2026Euphie, Please listen carefully.\u201d\u201cYes? What is it, Father?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of Princess Anne-Sophia? You may answer as honestly as you like. If you have any criticisms of her, I promise to keep them in confidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026If I have to describe her in a word, it would be \u2018unique\u2019. But, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person. She may be troublesome, it\u2019s true, but I also think that\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it possible for you to come to enjoy her company? I wouldn\u2019t want to force you into spending a year with someone you despise.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 yes. She may have somewhat\u2026 strange sensibilities, but in a situation where no one would help me, she was the one who reached out a hand to me. I can\u2019t exactly say I can relax completely around her, but\u2026\u201dIt was only yesterday that Euphilia and Anne-Sophia had properly made a connection, after all. But, although she was wary of her behaviour and inclinations, it wasn\u2019t as if she disliked her either. In fact, the feelings she held towards Anne-Sophia, who had saved her in her most desperate moment, were far from those of dislike.\u201cShe really hasn\u2019t changed much at all, that Princess.\u201dGrantz swallowed back his smile and coughed as if he were clearing his throat. Meanwhile, Euphilia tilted her head in confusion s she looked at her father.\u201cFather, are you close with Princess Anne-Sophia?\u201d\u201cAs Duke Magneta, we\u2019ve had no official relationship. However, anyone involved in His Majesty\u2019s inner circle of advisors will have had some sort of contact with her, whether they want to or not. She\u2019s always been pure, innocent and wild, that hasn\u2019t changed much at all since she was a young girl. Like a hurricane that doesn\u2019t know how to keep still.\u201dHearing that troublesome-sounding comparison from a man such as her father, Euphilia began to feel a little uneasy about what her future held.\u201cEuphie, please just listen to me, and consider everything I say past this point simply as possibilities.\u201d\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d\u201cStanding beside Princess Anne-Sophia, is that something you can imagine for yourself at any point?\u201d\u201c\u2026? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t quite understand the question\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe may have the power of a tornado, but she is also a power that is fleeting, and could melt away into the wind on a whim. Other than her exclusive maid, she doesn\u2019t have anyone she can truly rely on. She doesn\u2019t even truly open up her heart to her parents.\u201d\u201c\u2026Princess Anne-Sophia is\u2026 fleeting\u2026?\u201dWith her impression of the Princess up until now, it wasn\u2019t an analogy Euphilia could truly understand. To her, Anne-Sophia seemed wild and unrestrained, able to push forward and devastate anything foolish enough to get in her way, whether she meant to or not.Seeing that Euphilia didn\u2019t quite grasp his meaning, Grantz shook his head and continued.\u201cWhen the winds inside of her die down, Princess Anne-Sophia loses her lustre. You saw it yourself, didn\u2019t you? When the Princess said that she would become a despot if necessary to remove Prince Algard. That\u2019s also another side of her. It doesn\u2019t show up very often, but\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026To be honest, it scared me.\u201d\u201cIf she were to become Queen, those winds would inevitably come to a halt. As a Queen, for the sake of the people and the country, she would use her talents and the land would develop quickly. You may say that\u2019s what royalty is supposed to be, and I wouldn\u2019t disagree. However, Princess Anne-Sophia is also the type who doesn\u2019t forgive easily. What\u2019s more, Orfans has myself, your mother and Her Majesty as close-confidants. But, Princess Anne-Sophia wouldn\u2019t have such things as a Queen.\u201d\u201c\u2026She would be isolated as a ruler, you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because she understands herself completely that she exaggerated a threat of becoming a despot. She doesn\u2019t want to become the monstrous sort of Queen she knows she\u2019s capable of being. But, it\u2019s also true that she has the makings of an excellent ruler. I\u2019m sure you can understand Orfans\u2019 headache a bit, now.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me to support Princess Anne-Sophia, as someone she can confide in?\u201d\u201cI will never tell you what to be or what to do ever again. But, the truth is that the Princess is very unstable. I believe the behaviour you saw before was a reaction to being thrust into a troublesome situation she couldn\u2019t escape the usual way.\u201dUnstable. It\u2019s true that, after seeing a glimpse of Anne-Sophia acting like a propped up doll, Euphilia couldn\u2019t deny it.The Anne-Sophia who always wore a bright smile and rushed from one thing to another, and that cold-faced Anne-Sophia who seemed ready to sacrifice everything that stood in her way. It was as if she were flitting between two extremes. If that wasn\u2019t unstable, then what was?\u201cIt would be nice if she could be somewhat less of a problem child as well\u2026 No, perhaps that\u2019s just how her personality is. In any case, I\u2019ve long since talked with Orfans about this, and we\u2019ve agreed that she needs someone in her life to act as her foil, her supporter, and her anchor. And, as you can see, she adamantly refuses to take a husband or be married off somewhere.\u201d\u201cJust why does she go so far in refusing\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something that Orfans, or even her mother the Queen, can truly pry into. I\u2019m sure that her personal maid would have more insight into her feelings, though. And that leads me to my point, Euphie. I will be straight-forward with you. If you decide that you would like to act in tandem with the rumours surrounding Princess Anne-Sophia, I will not rebuke you in any way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201dJust what did her father say? Euphilia tried to make sense of the words she just heard.\u201cIf Princess Algard manages to right himself, then a child is unnecessary. In fact, even were it to become necessary for Princess Anne-Sophia to become Queen, then adopting a child of Prince Algard would allow the royal line to be continued without problems.\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 what are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re merely discussing possibilities, remember? I\u2019m not telling you to fall in love with Princess Anne-Sophia.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s! I\u2026! Right, wasn\u2019t she herself unclear when confirming those rumours in the first place?!\u201d\u201cForgive me for being blunt, Euphie. But, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s also deeply worried about you, since a man has so badly hurt you.\u201dGrantz couldn\u2019t meet her eyes as he looked troubled. Euphilia almost forgot what they were talking about as she stared at her father, since this was the first time she had ever seen him show weakness like that.\u201cNo matter what happens, so long as you\u2019re happy, then that\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019m sure that both I and the House will manage in your absence. Just for a year, try and stay by her side, not as the daughter of Duke Magenta, but simply as Euphie. Be that as a friend, or something else, either way, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m certain that she will treat you well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for your concern. I can\u2019t deny that, um, I\u2019d rather not be around a man right now\u2026 And when it comes to something like friendship or\u2026 um, love\u2026 I\u2019ve always put my duty of becoming a Queen first, so I\u2019ve never really thought about it\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I brought it up. I\u2019m sure that, right now, you\u2019re also feeling unstable. So, like I said, I\u2019m worried.\u201d\u201c\u2026And that\u2019s why you\u2019d like me to become close with Princess Anne-Sophia?\u201d\u201cThat Princess, do you think she\u2019s the kind of person to be two-faced?\u201dWhilst Euphilia was certain that Anne-Sophia didn\u2019t have any malicious thoughts towards her, she couldn\u2019t shake her impression of the Princess as a raging wind.She couldn\u2019t see what the future could hold. Just what would become of the two of them, and so on. And, just what did Anne-Sophia want of her?But, no matter what happens, she was certain it wouldn\u2019t be peaceful. Even if she didn\u2019t like it, she had to admit that the destination Anne-Sophia was hurtling towards every day of her life was not a quiet one.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u201cAh\u2026 ACHOOOOOO !! \u2026Ugh\u2026 Someone\u2019s talking about me, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cWhy are you making such a serious pose when you\u2019re meant to be taking off your dress?! Please, hurry up and get changed, Your Highness!\u201d\u201cOwowowow! Don\u2019t phull on miee cheeekhhh?!\u201dDad ships it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEver since it was agreed that Miss Euphilia was going to be my research assistant, things have been awfully busy. The main reason for that is because it\u2019s also been agreed that Miss Euphilia will be staying in her own private room in my royal villa.Up until now, Miss Euphilia had been living with her parents at the ducal manor, which is close enough to the royal palace grounds to commute every day, but most Magicology research is treated as a state secret. More importantly, judging by how my research binges usually go, there\u2019ll probably be quite a few all-nighters involved.What\u2019s why I made the decision to have a room prepared for Miss Euphilia in my villa, but\u2026 The problem is, there\u2019s only a certain number of people permitted to come and go from the villa.For the most part, it\u2019s solely run by myself and Illya. Well, to be honest, mostly just Illya. It\u2019s only when she needs to go out on some business or take a break is a specially selected maid (mostly picked for their ability to keep mum about what they see and hear) dispatched from the palace proper.To put it bluntly, there\u2019s not much manpower here, so just bringing in the furniture was going to be a pain. That meant I, a Princess, had to go and drag furniture around. Well, I guess so long as it\u2019s just furniture, that\u2019s fine.Or, at least, that\u2019s what I thought at first. It ended up just being me dragging heavy pieces of furniture whilst listening to the instructions of maids, I felt like a mover hauling things from a truck into a new house from my previous life.\u201cSimply bringing the furniture inside is plenty. Please do not think of arranging it, Your Highness. The Princess has an sense of interior design, after all.\u201d\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is that my tastes are weird? Or just plain bad?\u201d\u201cWell, yes, now that you put it that way.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even deny it?!\u201d\u201cPlease leave the arrangements to us. You\u2019re going to be visiting the home of His Excellency today after all, are you not?\u201dI nodded to the leader of the maids who had been sent from the palace. After finishing up here, the next thing on my to-do list was to pick up Miss Euphilia. Illya was the only one who was going to be coming with me, since apparently, it would be a if I went to Duke Magneta\u2019s home on my own, father insisted Illya go with me.Personally, I really wanted Illya to stay here when I\u2019m out. There\u2019s just too many places in the villa that I\u2019m worried about the maids stumbling into, after all. Not because I was worried about secrets getting out, the maids sent from the royal palace were all pretty tight-lipped, but there are a few rooms in this place that are pretty dangerous if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.They were briefed to be careful, but I can\u2019t help but worry a bit, can I? Well, since I was basically being politely pushed out once I brought up the last piece of furniture, I left what was to be Miss Euphilia\u2019s new room with that on my mind.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cIllya?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to get you prepared. It wouldn\u2019t do to be rude to Duke Magneta, after all.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right, since I am going to be carrying off his precious daughter. Especially after what Allie did, I guess it\u2019d be best to do things quietly this time, right?\u201d\u201cMy word\u2026 Our Princess, more akin to a wild beast than a royal lady, a demon from hell than an angel of the people, being so obedient\u2026 Ah, perhaps the world will be ending tomorrow\u2026?!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that going too far?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simply the way of things\u2026\u201dShe was like some melodramatic actress in an opera. Despite putting on a fa\u00e7ade of utmost melancholy in one second, Illya suddenly straightened up with a professional glint in her eye the next.\u201cNow then, first off, we must get you bathed. After that comes makeup, then onto the dress selection\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really do come to life when you get the chance to dress me up, don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d\u201cFlowers shine all the brighter when plucked and given a vase, and the same goes for you, Your Highness.\u201dAnd, so, Illya took me off to be scrubbed up and polished. Since I\u2019ve known her for this long, I\u2019ve learnt that at a certain point it\u2019s absolutely futile to resist her, so I went along with it.After the bath, I was plied with so much makeup that I barely recognized myself when I looked in the mirror. I really do have to admire the passion of Illya and the other maids, huh? Maybe it\u2019s similar to my own passion for magic? Thinking about it like that makes it a little easier to put up with the chore of getting dressed up by them.Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of Illya\u2019s reflection in the mirror. Although she\u2019s in her late twenties, her skin looks like she\u2019s still in her teens. It really was worth spending the time researching magic tools that would help keep Illya beautiful, wasn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026Illya sure is beautiful, huh?\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m serious? I\u2019ve always thought that, ever since I was little.\u201d\u201cAh, how nostalgic. I remember when you were little too, Your Highness, before you suddenly started running amok in the royal palace, developing magical tools and injuring yourself in a hundred different ways.\u201dIllya\u2019s scathing words almost sounded affectionate as she combed my hair. Although she\u2019s talking about my past failures, I think of them as precious memories that Illya and I share.Back then, when I learned that I didn\u2019t have any aptitude for casting magic, I quickly turned towards researching and making magical tools. And, Illya was by my side from the beginning. I wonder, if it wasn\u2019t for her, just where would I have ended up? I can\u2019t help but think about it.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true that there have been a lot of failures, but they\u2019re just the stepping stones to success!\u201d\u201cIn that case, perhaps my failures to escape from you are the same?\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, what success did they bring you, Illya?\u201d\u201cWhy, I\u2019d consider this moment right now a success.\u201dI muttered under my breath. How can she say something that embarrassing so proudly? It\u2019s mortifying.\u201cI could hardly leave you be, after all\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you say something?\u201dIllya just smiled in response. Even though we\u2019ve been together for ten years, it really doesn\u2019t seem as if Illya\u2019s face has changed at all from my first memories of her. Even if she\u2019s become more beautiful with age, Illya will always be Illya.I can\u2019t really put into words just how much I appreciate her always being by my side. If I tell her that she\u2019s like my sister, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get really mad at me. Besides, I\u2019m not really sure sister is the right word. More, like\u2026 my precious partner?\u201cBesides, despite what I say, I do think that being here can be quite enjoyable. I suppose that getting married really isn\u2019t the only sort of happiness available to a woman, after all.\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry about that\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be. Since my family\u2019s peerage is so low, I\u2019d only be a pawn in a political marriage anyways. Besides, one might say that I ended up being married to a Princess instead, so I can\u2019t really say I\u2019ve done too poorly, thanks to you.\u201dIllya was the daughter of a Viscount. With parents who had an eye to elevating their status, they had been looking for Illya to marry into a powerful house. One of the main reasons why she had been sent to apprentice as a maid at the Royal Palace was to catch the eye of a suitor from a prominent family.But, she caught my eye instead. Well, that is to say, when I heard that Illya\u2019s family were going to decide an engagement for her that she didn\u2019t want at all, I may have gone\u2026 a little overboard in making sure that she stayed with me.Thanks to that, Illya was fortunately unable to escape from me, and that\u2019s how we have the relationship that we do now \u2013 one where she helps me with my magical research. Well, I can\u2019t say that everything turned out great, though.Although Illya\u2019s family were initially fairly happy that she had gotten so close to me, even though her engagement had been broken, once I relinquished my claim to the throne it seems that it had caused problems between them, and they had become estranged. Oh, now that I think about it, I wonder if they\u2019ll start getting along if I\u2019m reasserting my claim?Illya had told me that she didn\u2019t care, though, since her relationship with her family had always been cold. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t refer to herself using her family\u2019s name anymore either. Well, I try not to ask about it too much, but to me, it sounds like she\u2019s essentially been disowned.But, it doesn\u2019t matter, since to me Illya is Illya. It doesn\u2019t matter whose family she\u2019s from. That said, since she\u2019s so beautiful, I\u2019m sure that she\u2019d be really popular\u2026 However, I don\u2019t want to think about that, since if I lose Illya I\u2019d be in real trouble. Besides, thinking about that kind of thing behind Illya\u2019s back would be rude, right?\u201cYou know, Illya, things are probably only going to get more exciting in the future?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what the Princess prefers. Well, putting that aside, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to start going easier on you, either.\u201dIllya\u2019s reply made me laugh. I\u2019ve only made it this far thanks to her, And since I can\u2019t thank her enough anyways, I\u2019ll just leave what we both already know unsaid.\u201cFufu, I\u2019m perfectly disguised like an actual princess\u2026 Excellently done, Illya!\u201d\u201cJust what is this saying?\u201dHer knuckles rapping against the crown of my head made a sharp crack echo through the room.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0aAfter finishing disguising myself as a Princess, I rode in a carriage to Duke Magneta\u2019s estate alongside Illya.Thinking back on it now, I haven\u2019t visited here since I was just a little girl. Back then, I was still close to Allie, and Miss Euphilia hadn\u2019t become his fiancee.The Duke\u2019s family is technically a branch house of the royal family, but in terms of actual an blood relationship, the Magneta\u2019s are very distant relations. I also remember hearing that Duke Grantz and my father were childhood friends, who worked together very closely back in the day.So, when I was young, I had visited the Duke\u2019s mansion, but that was so long ago that it may as well not have happened. It\u2019s best to try and keep calm and think of this as my first ever visit.\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Illya.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dGuided by one of the maids from the Duke\u2019s house, Illya and I walked through the mansion. It was plain to see just how amazing a place it was the moment we stepped through the gates, but I guess you wouldn\u2019t expect anything less of the Magneta house, considering their deep history.The room that we were guided to ended up being the main parlour, and waiting for us there were Miss Euphilia, Duke Grantz and the Duchess, Madame Nerschell.Madame Nerschell didn\u2019t seem to share too many features with Miss Euphilia, it seems that she takes more after her father. Since it\u2019s been so long since I last saw her, I ended up just sort of gawking at her. No, no, no! I have to actually try to be polite and courteous this time!\u201cWe\u2019re deeply humbled by your offer of assistance in this matter, Princess Anne-Sophia.\u201d\u201cNo, being able to invite Miss Euphilia to join me was something that I personally desired. So, I ought to be the one thanking you. More importantly, I must also sincerely apologize for my younger brother\u2019s dishonourable behaviour. Although the royal family has already extended an official apology to all of you, I would like to offer my own personal remorse for all of this as well.\u201d\u201cPlease raise your head, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Princess Anne-Sophia. The most important thing here is that you\u2019re the one who saved our adorable little Euphie. And since we\u2019re deeply grateful for the opportunity you\u2019ve also provided, it wouldn\u2019t feel right accepting an apology like this.\u201dSince Duke Grantz and Madame Nerschell both told me to raise my head, I couldn\u2019t keep it lowered any longer. Pulling myself upright, I quickly took a seat. Illya, meanwhile, took her place standing behind me.Across from me, on the other side of the parlour table, Duke Grantz sat with his wife and daughter on either side of him.\u201cIt certainly has been some time since we last saw each other, hasn\u2019t it, Madame Nerschell? I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re in good health.\u201d\u201cYes, the same to you, Princess Anne-Sophia. I\u2019ve certainly heard much about you, though? That said, it really has been such a long time since you last came to visit us\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter Algard\u2019s engagement was decided, I thought it was best to keep my distance from the home of Duke Magneta.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you plainly, although my feelings on the matter should be obvious now, from the very beginning I had my doubts about Prince Algard. Rather, now that everything has been brought to the light, perhaps this opportunity to cut things off really may end up being more constructive in the long-term?\u201dThat smiling face has a crazy amount of pressure, Madame Nerschell! Duke Grantz\u2019s expressionless face might be super scary, but that kind of cold smile is like the last thing you see before you die!It\u2019s not even the least bit surprising that Miss Euphilia, the daughter of these two, has a bit of a reputation for having a stern gaze. Blood always tells after all, huh?\u201cI\u2019ve already heard the details from my husband and Euphie. So long as Euphie is happy with the arrangement, I\u2019m happy to let her go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m deeply humbled by your trust. I cannot begin to describe how grateful I am for the fact that you have given me the opportunity to regain the honour of our royal family. I will do everything in my power to take care of Miss Euphilia, the precious daughter of Duke and Duchess Magneta. I swear it, in the name of the royal family.\u201d\u201cYou really are in top form today, aren\u2019t you, Princess Anne-Sophia? I have to say though, when you swore in the name of the royal family just now, it took everything I had to stifle a laugh.\u201dDuke Grantz\u2026?! Well, it\u2019s not like I disagree that this is all a bit silly, but you don\u2019t have to say it out loud! I\u2019m really doing my best to wear the mask of a Princess here! Ahh, maaan, I can even hear Illya sighing behind me. Well, whatever happens now isn\u2019t my fault anymore.\u201cJeez, Lord Grantz, even I know that there\u2019s a time and place for things!\u201d\u201cAh, my apologies. I just never knew that Her Highness could inspire such awe. However, I believe we all understand how since you were. I\u2019d also like to ask you to take good care of Euphie.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll do it with lots of love!\u201dFuhehehe! Now that I\u2019ve got Miss Euphilia, I\u2019ll be able to make progress with that tool\u2026 Oh, and that piece of research too\u2026!Actually having magic but being unable to use it normally can be a real pain at times. That\u2019s the reason I started developing magical tools, though. But, now I\u2019ve got Miss Euphilia, who has excellent aptitudes for all forms of magic, I couldn\u2019t wish for a better assistant! Ahh, here I come, my future rosy research life!\u201cHowever, Princess Anne-Sophia\u2026 You will be sharing your life with my daughter from now on. Don\u2019t you think that \u2018Miss Euphilia\u2019 is awfully distant-sounding?\u201d\u201cM-Mother?!\u201dI stared blankly at Madam Nerschell as she proposed that. But, she\u2019s right, calling her Miss Euphilia does seem a little distant\u2026 I want to get closer with her as well!\u201cThen, can I call you Euphie? Ah, but if that\u2019s a bit too much, then I\u2019ll call you Euphilia!\u201d\u201c\u2026Please address me as you like.\u201d\u201cThanks! Then, you can call me Anise, okay? Let\u2019s get along super well from now on, Euphie!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Princess Anise. I look forward to your guidance and teachings in the ways of Magic.\u201dAlright, you got i-\u2026! Wait, umm\u2026 Speaking of teaching, what about Euphie and the Academy? I don\u2019t think she can stay there, considering everything that\u2019s happened, right?\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s going to happen between Euphie and the Academy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very well aware, our Euphie is an excellent academic. So, officially, the reason that she won\u2019t be attending the Academy any more although she hasn\u2019t graduated is that she\u2019s transferring to study under Princess Anne-Sophia.\u201d\u201cWe felt that it would be important for people to know that Prince Algard\u2019s actions weren\u2019t the only reason behind this, but also Princess Anne-Sophia\u2019s strong request for Euphilia to personally come and study under her.\u201dAhh, that makes sense. If they go back and say that I had always been trying to scout Euphie and that\u2019s why she left school, then maybe it might make people focus less on the broken engagement.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then please use my name however you like. Besides, it\u2019s true that I\u2019ve always been interested in Euphie, after all.\u201d\u201cOh, my, then I suppose we shall have to rely on that kindness of yours? Wouldn\u2019t you say so, Grantz?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll make sure that Euphie is exempted from attending the Academy until the date of her graduation next year, and that she\u2019ll also be exempted from having to attend the graduation ceremony as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019d be awful if the reason Euphie had to leave school was because of her engagement being called off, huh? If I can be used to stop that, then please do!\u201d\u201cThank you for everything, Princess Anise.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201dMaaan, I sure am glad that things ended up getting settled, one way or another. As I breathed a sigh of relief, I suddenly remembered\u2026There was another child in the Magneta house, wasn\u2019t there? If I remember right, he was Euphie\u2019s little brother? Uh, what was his name again\u2026?\u201cCome to think of it, don\u2019t you have a little brother too, Euphie?\u201d\u201cAh, you mean Caind? Well, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThat boy, he\u2019s awfully unhappy about the whole business with Euphie leaving the academy to work with you, Your Highness. I didn\u2019t even tell him that you were coming today, but he must\u2019ve learned about it somehow and snuck out. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s at the Academy right now.\u201dAhh, so that\u2019s how it is, huh\u2026? Euphie\u2019s little brother seems to have a bone to pick with me.\u201cHe must be upset that it seems like his sister is just being passed around and used by the royal family, huh\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s um\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry about all this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s your fault at all. Besides, it\u2019s not like the rumours about me have probably helped, either.\u201d\u201cAt any rate, we had hoped that if the two of you met, perhaps he could understand you. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m sure the atmosphere right now at the Academy must be quite stifling.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the mood at the Academy is just awful, it seems the entire student body is on edge.\u201dMadam Nerschell sighed with a glum expression. I\u2019m really sorry about that, but for once this really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I\u2019ve never been to the Academy, after all! Apparently, father vetoed the entire idea of me attending because I\u2019d absolutely cause problems if I went. Well, I don\u2019t really disagree.After that, my meeting with the Duke and Duchess of Magneta ended without a hitch, and Euphie and I returned to the palace.Although the issue between Caind and me had the potential to be a bit prickly, I definitely want to stay friendly with Euphie\u2019s family, so I\u2019ll make sure to visit in the future.\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u3000\uff0a\u201cFufu, it feels like I haven\u2019t been able to get anything done ever since this whole thing with Euphie started!\u201dAfter I brought Euphie to the villa and asked Illya to show her around, I made a beeline straight for my workshop. Thinking about it, I really haven\u2019t done a single bit of research for the past two days because of this whole debacle. Just what happens to a master\u2019s skills if they step away from their craft for , I wonder? More importantly, just how far behind on my research would I be?!\u201cBut, now that Euphie\u2019s here, I have to rethink my experiments, huh\u2026 Since there\u2019s a lot more I can do now, after all.\u201dI mused to myself, as I took out my notepad. I always keep it on me to sketch out designs that I remember from my previous life, or to jot down any ideas that just happen to come to mind.I\u2019m essentially a foreign element in this world, after all. I\u2019m conscious that these memories of another life have changed my way of thinking and how I see the world, but I\u2019m also conscious that they could disappear just as suddenly as they came to me.So, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve prepared a meticulous amount of notes, just in case that does happen. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call them proof that I was alive or anything, but I figured it would definitely be a good idea to make sure that something was left behind.\u201cHmmm, well, for now, it\u2019s probably best to refrain from any style experiments, right? Going outside a lot probably isn\u2019t a good idea, either. If that\u2019s the case, experiments that use a lot of materials are also out\u2026 Actually, that\u2019 a good idea, let\u2019s talk to Euphie so that we both understand each other a little better\u2026\u201dWhenever I\u2019m left to my own devices, I tend to talk to myself a bit. But, as I paced, absorbed in my thoughts, I heard a knock at the door. From the other side of the door, I could hear Illya\u2019s voice\u2026 Then, is Euphie with her?\u201cCome in?\u201d\u201cPlease excuse us.\u201dOnce I responded, Illya entered the workshop straight away. And, behind her, there was Euphie. She must have changed clothes, since she was wearing a light dress that looked easy to move around in. Euphie gazed with curiosity around my workshop as she stepped inside.Meanwhile, I opened up my arms to welcome Euphie. Finally, Euphie has become my accompli-\u2026 <b>AHEM</b> \u2026 What I mean to say is, my coworker. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at that fact.\u201cWelcome, Euphie! This is my castle, but please treat it as your own as well.\u201d\u201cThis is your workshop, Princess Anise?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Be careful what you touch, okay? There are lots of prototypes in here.\u201dAt my warning, Euphie froze up a little bit with a start. Well, there shouldn\u2019t be any real problems though, since I have a separate storage area for anything that might actually be seriously dangerous. Sometimes I spend all night get sort of absorbed in something I probably shouldn\u2019t and end up making something I\u2019d probably regret anyone else ever seeing, so\u2026I added a seat to the desk that Illya and I usually sit across from each other from for Euphie to have. Whilst Eupie sat down and Illya prepared tea for us, it really was just another day in the workshop, apart from the newcomer.\u201cOnce again, glad to be working with you from now on, Euphie.\u201d\u201cYes. I hope that, just like Princess Anise, I can invent things to help the people.\u201d\u201cAhh, you don\u2019t have to be so serious and stuffy about it, though? Let\u2019s just do what we can do, let\u2019s go with that sort of feeling. Of course, getting results is what we\u2019re after, but there\u2019s always going to be more failures than successes.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIf you see the moon as a success, then failures are like all the stars around it. But, I think that\u2019s just how things have to be, you know? If we never went reaching for the moon at all, then the night sky would never be lit up by those stars.\u201d\u201cI see now. So, that\u2019s the sort of philosophy you have?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. Otherwise, if you get too caught up on results, all the failures will just make you end up feeling impatient and frustrated. You shouldn\u2019t work like you have an obligation to anyone for results, so you don\u2019t have to carry that on your back, okay?\u201dThis palace wasn\u2019t built in a day, and the secrets of Magicology weren\u2019t going to unravel themselves that easily either. Magicology is a life-long passion, my lover that I\u2019ll keep until I\u2019m old and grey! I can try and dress it up as something cool, but the truth is I\u2019ll just never run out of things I want to make! And if people end up benefitting because of what I make, then that\u2019s a good thing too, right?Euphie nodded, seemingly impressed. Ahh, what a good and honest girl. Well, maybe she\u2019s just happy about being released from her old obligations\u2026 Euphie must have killed her emotions as she pursued becoming the next Queen, but these past few days she\u2019s seemed more like a girl her age in a lot of ways.Considering the time that she\u2019s had of it up until now, I want at least the next year of hers to be full of fun every day. Awesome inventions! Fun magic tools! An experience she wouldn\u2019t forget even if she lived a thousand years!\u201cI think we should have a party today, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cA\u2026 party?\u201d\u201cFor you, Euphie. Well, we won\u2019t call it a party to commemorate your engagement being broken, but let\u2019s call it a welcome party instead? Either way, I\u2019m thankful for Euphie being here! Riiight, Illyaaaa?!\u201d\u201cI also think that it\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it truly all right to do something like that?\u201dEuphie\u2019s eyebrows were drawn tight, but she looked more embarrassed than mad. Putting one hand on the desk, I reached across to her and pointed at her nose.\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because I want to! Or, do you hate the idea, Euphie?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s just, um, this is a little sudden.\u201d\u201cWell, I hope you can get used to that part of being here. But, there\u2019s no need to rush things.\u201dThis time, I held out my palm to Euphie. Euphie, still seemingly a little confused, unconsciously reached out and placed her hand in mine.Then, I firmly gripped hers, and gave it a light shake. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll be leading her by the hand to do all sorts of fun things from now on. That\u2019s what I was thinking to myself, anyways, as I grinned back at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: 7\u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019d like to build up a lot of awareness with Uffi.\u201d\u201cThe folding of perceptions, is it?\u201cYeah. Yufi knows I can\u2019t use magic, right?Yuffi gave me a slow nod, although he gave me a look that seemed lost somewhere.In this world, a great nobleman can use magic. I have talent in it, and the amount of magic I have and the number of magical aptitudes I have become statuses.I am incompetent in that respect. A body that has magic but cannot use magic. This is innate, and it can be the result of my research that it is not of an acquired and changing nature.\u201cThe reason I can\u2019t use magic is mostly because I\u2019m guessing\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease wait?\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMaking guesses? That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that\u2026\u201d\u201cSo let\u2019s get to know each other,\u201d I said.\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. Excuse me, go on.\u201dIt seemed confusing, Ufi, but I nodded whether you were convinced by what I had explained.\u201cFirst of all, the magic is exercised with the help of the Spirit.\u201d\u201cYes. Work on spirits that exist everywhere in the world, at the cost of magic and form magic. And there is the nature of magic that fits with the Spirit, and it is taught that it becomes aptitude.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s a common story. I took a step from there.\u201d\u201cA step-by-step perception, when you say?\u201cLiterally. How can it be decided that magic conforms to the Spirit, or how can the Spirit shape magic at the price of magic?\u201dIn the first place, the magic of this world is exercised by the Spirit. And the number and variety of spirits are numerous.The four great spirits of fire, water, earth, wind, the original spirits of light and darkness, the subspecies spirits derived from them, etc\u2026. than to say. Whatever the typical spirits are, it\u2019s hard to distribute them when you include even derived subspecies spirits! I\u2019ve been filing too fine to distribute, but enough to throw it out on the way!That investigation showed that the Spirit basically says that even if there are differences in attributes, they are essentially ecological, or that the nature is the same. The Spirit is just something that drifts in the air if the Spirit is alone. It\u2019s like when this gathers or has the will to be promoted to a being like the Great Spirit or God.When summed up, the Spirit is a spiritual being drifting in the world, and what can be recognized visually is a unique individual, such as a strong collective. And we know that it feeds on magic.\u201cIs magic food for the Spirit?\u201cThe Spirit is a spiritual being, a spiritual force invisible to magic. I defined magic as the power of zero from the soul. And the Spirit doesn\u2019t have something called self-consciousness if he has to be a collective and be able to even see. I thought magic was processing the spirits.\u201d\u201cWhat processed the Spirit is magic, not what the Spirit prayed for embodies!?\u201dI laugh without thinking like Yuffi\u2019s surprise. Because I understand that there is no such thing as an existing mindset.\u201cIt\u2019s normal to think that way in general, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Spirits are usually like air drifting unconsciously. Change it by giving it food called magic, and make it magic. I believe that having a cap on magic is like the blood of a soul in the first place. And even though we don\u2019t get the amount we need out of the vessel, we think we\u2019re going to get out for the unnecessary amount.\u201dThe vessel called soul is packed with magic, or what is the source of magic. This will never go outside for what it takes, but anything but what it takes will be released outside. This is who magic is.The Spirit is unconscious, drawn by magic, and entrusted to the consciousness to which it was given its presence. Explain to Uffi the idea that magic is an act of alteration of the existence of the Spirit, and that the Spirit is not necessarily conscious and responsive to it.It was clear that Yufi looked sinister. Some people are followers of the Spirit Faith who worship the Spirit. From those people, my thoughts would be heretical, too. So I don\u2019t usually talk about this idea. Because of the circumstances, Yufi will be a collaborator, so I thought I\u2019d have to talk to her.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve never thought of magic or spirits as natural before, why, etc.\u201d\u201cEven I was driven by necessity to find out, so I came to this conclusion. So, if you can figure out how it works, you can see why I can\u2019t use magic.\u201d\u201cYou said you found out what prevented you from using magic?\u201cIt\u2019s a magic the Spirit doesn\u2019t like, simply put\u201dYes. I have magic. That\u2019s for sure. It is evidenced by the fact that it is activating the magic props. But I have not been able to use magic.The Spirit tries to keep his presence with magic as food. And unconsciously seek magic that goes well with you. That will be recognized as the \u201cfit attribute\u201d of the side that uses magic.If the Spirit of Water is doing the magic he prefers, so as to obtain the fitness of the water. In other words, aptitude fluctuates depending on how the Spirit likes the flavor.\u201cI don\u2019t know what this may be, but I think what happened to nobility and royalty started when I signed with the Spirit.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the Spirit Contract? Though the legend is said to be the beginning of the aristocracy that he exchanged covenants with superior spirits such as the Great Spirit and borrowed his strength. There are still a few, but there are also spiritual contractors.\u201d\u201cYes, a contract with the Spirit that is visible and self-sufficient can be so powerful that it cannot be compared to normal magic. That\u2019s why they say the country began by incorporating the spirits into the covenant and creating a system called aristocracy.\u201d\u201cI see. It\u2019s the remnants of your ancestral spiritual covenant that allows the nobles to use magic.\u201dMaybe. That was quite a while ago, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll know the truth unless you dig up some old records.Although following history is one romance, the romance I should follow is another.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know if it has become the nature of the magic I prefer because it is the blood muscle that I have contracted with the Spirit. Leaving that aside, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I can\u2019t invite spirits to use magic because it doesn\u2019t fit the spirits.\u201d\u201cSo, Master Anis is developing the magic props?\u201cI have magic. We need to make the most of it. And I wanted to use magic. That didn\u2019t have to be in the form of magic the Spirit did. By the way, I don\u2019t think we can use magic on civilians because there\u2019s no remnants of the spiritual covenant. Still, I think it\u2019s only rare that even civilians can use magic, probably because of those circumstances. Or an aristocratic bastard.\u201d\u201cI was born with the magic favored by the Spirit,\u201d he said. Should we consider it lucky? \u201c\u201cYeah, maybe. Leaving that aside, without that talent I had to overshadow it with effort. And I discovered things.\u201d\u201cIs it a discovery? And that led to the development of demonic props?\u201cRight. First, I explored the use of magic without passing the Spirit.\u201dMagic power releases excess minutes from the body and becomes foggy. If the Spirit is a magic that is not attracted either, it can also be said to be a resource that is wasted. I decided to do some research to see if I could use this for something. Could this have been around the age of six?\u201cThe first thing I laid eyes on was the Spirit Stone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a crystal of spiritual power that spirits gather where they gather and are said to be given to them by high-ranking spirits.\u201d\u201cYeah, so I decided to find out who that was.\u201d\u201c? Identity, is it?\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just a stone, is it? We can\u2019t figure out how it\u2019s created without looking at those principles.\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming\u201dCrystalline stone given by the Spirit, that is the Spirit stone. With this, even civilians can use the power of the Spirit. However, the applications are limitless.Instead of a fireplace if it is a spiritual stone of fire. If it\u2019s a spiritual stone of water, we can get the water out, but that\u2019s it. If it\u2019s a spiritual stone of the wind, it produces the wind, but it doesn\u2019t have enough power to fly people. The spiritual stones of the earth can enrich the land, but they cannot shake the earth.I mean, I can only do things like degraded magic. Now, the real question is how could Spirit Stone have done that and how could it have been created by the Spirit?\u201cSimply put, it\u2019s the remains of the Spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cOr the coagulated of the Spirit. Spirit that has materialized, without will. So I guess it\u2019s best to say carcass.\u201d\u201c\u2026 when they say that, something you should be thankful for will strike you as badly as possible\u201d\u201cIf you open the lid, reality is such a thing. Well, spirits are basically unrelated to resentment because unlike organisms, the concept of death is rare. I guess not when you\u2019re more than a big spirit with a clear will.\u201dSo spiritual stones are rich in spirits and are discovered in rich lands. The Kingdom of Palletia has a good balance between nature and population. In an environment where the Spirit is reasonably habitable, there are human beings beside him who produce the magic that feeds the Spirit.If you go to the depths, you can get pure quality things near people if you mine spiritual stones to the extent that they can help you with your daily life without going to the depths. It is no exaggeration to say that Spirit Stone is the corner responsible for the export industry of the Kingdom of Palletia.\u201cYou miss it. Flying through the sky, she used the spiritual stones of the wind in bundles, and plunged them into the walls of the castle.\u201d\u201cHe said he got into it\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought my whole body would fall apart\u201dBecause of that failure, I was able to obtain doubts about the Spirit Stone that I did not have any magic, so it turned out to be Auray.The nature of the spiritual stone was well understood. And if you don\u2019t have a number, you won\u2019t be like the magic you want, and you won\u2019t be able to use it freely. I can also say that my trial and exploration began there.\u201cWell, I did a lot of things. Truly the last decade has been\u2026 a day of trial and error\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that the reason why you became known as the Princess Odd Heavenly\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, you are. Because I really wanted to use magic. I\u2019m still not happy with it. The magic that sprays from the body can now be effectively utilized with magic props. We\u2019re only going to develop it to increase its variety.\u201d\u201cAs far as it goes\u2026. So why did you want me as your assistant?Yufi leans her neck in doubt. You can say that Yufi and my qualities are the opposite. I am a hater who is turned that way by the Spirit, and Uffi is a popular person loved by the Spirit. It\u2019s really fitness for all attributes.\u201cBeing able to actually see all sorts of magic. And because he\u2019s a mysterious creature with all the attributes and aptitudes and all the cheats and no physical abilities.\u201d\u201cChi and\u2026?\u2026 Um, am I that weird?\u201cI think it\u2019s weird. \u2018Cause there\u2019s something wrong with Yufi\u2019s existence. Even though it\u2019s not weird to have some parts of your body go crazy. That\u2019s the kind of stats you get, too, huh?\u201cHuh\u2026?Hilarious or slightly pale, Yufi blinks and looks at me. In fact, there is something in this world that should be called a unique disease because it is this world. That can be a disease about magic.\u201cFor example, you think that unnecessary amounts of magic are inherently in the body and mentally impaired? Sometimes you do, don\u2019t you? Even though my parents are so fine, my kids grow up to be such bad aristocrats.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah\u2026. It\u2019s not a question of education, it\u2019s a disease?\u201cYou\u2019re prone to heart disease. Magic is something that comes out of your soul. If we do not have a stable balance between our bodies and our souls, we will soon make one or both worse. So there are a lot of cases where the magic doesn\u2019t go out of the body and you get sick or, conversely, you get sick.\u201dIf you don\u2019t get out of your soul and you have magic, if you say it, you will cause root rot. The soul becomes unbearable and distorted by saturating magic. It was a serious discovery that some children would distort their personality or come to their bodies with anomalies if their souls were distorted.It\u2019s just that it hasn\u2019t spread to the country very yet, or it hasn\u2019t. Although I discovered it, I can\u2019t swallow it, and most importantly, I\u2019m not a doctor. The doctors gathered by the royal family have been entrusted with research and verification.\u201cThen I have an easy-to-like magic by the Spirit, so there\u2019s no such anxiety?\u201cConversely. Now there is too much magic eaten to feed to the source of magic inside the soul, making it sick and weak or risking carrying obstacles. I think Yufi has a miraculous balance between how much God loved her. Hundreds of years, no, maybe one genius on a millennial basis\u201d\u201c\u2026 the fact that the amount of magic triggers disease is more surprising than what I\u2019m called a genius\u201d\u201cYufi is sweet. It\u2019s better to be balanced about magic. More or less. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that the medical examinations around here have also begun to be judged by magic research, especially possession and proficiency in magic exercises.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s why magic classes at the college take measurements like that\u2026\u201dPrevention is possible even if the intention cannot be explained. Indeed, a few years after I discovered this theory, the School of Magic began to measure the amount of magic holdings and the proficiency of magic exercises to get statistics on any anomalies.Of course, magic isn\u2019t the only cause of heartbreaking. It is possible that those who possess abundant magic or are skillful at using magic will be subjected to unspoken persecution if they do not say that their magic is bad. I hear your father has been very careful in this regard.\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about kids who are a lot of magic and rough, and when they learn magic and become more proficient, they calm down and their spirits stabilize. Well, if things don\u2019t work out, you\u2019ll even hit eight. Magic is a factor.\u201d\u201cBut it is a great step forward that we have been able to discover the cause\u2026. but is it magic to look into these things?\u201cNo, just by-products. I\u2019m not a specialist, so even I can only talk by guessing. That kind of thing should be figured out by experts. I\u2019m not a doctor, although I\u2019m proud to be a leader in magic.\u201dMagic can\u2019t use magic. It\u2019s the kind of discipline I\u2019ve given birth to to be able to use magic.The 'science\u201d of previous life\u2019s knowledge, just magically tailored by reproducing it with magic props. It\u2019s supposed to be for that kind of use, right?By the way, I\u2019m not without researchers researching magic itself, but I\u2019m not very close to me because I\u2019m kind of on my way to something like faith, theology, or religion.I was just impressed by practitioner magic researchers. I have been personally thanked for the fact that the abnormality that comes with the balance of body and magic was scaled from my eyes and could have a very good effect on my drilling and my disciples\u2019 education.Well! Normally! Someone who can use magic! Hey! Jealous! And treat me like a troubled child! I\u2019ll make a fool out of you! Because they made fun of me until I was about to die of sorcery in the first place! There\u2019s a little bit of remorse left! I won\u2019t forgive you, Magic Ministry bastards\u2026!\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis?\u201cHa, a little black sentiment for the Ministry of Magic\u2026\u201d\u201cMinistry of Magic?\u2026 I heard you were unfriendly.\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Magic side is much easier now. I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s good now though. It\u2019s just that the princess is pulling the strings from the old days. And then there\u2019s your personal jealousy.\u201d\u201cShut up! What an elite wizard!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.A lot of guys look weird, so I\u2019m angry about Sang\u2026! With a guy who even sends a yellow voice or gaze when he sarcastically tells me? I wish I was dead\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 is that why? What makes Algard so close to the people of the Ministry of Magic?\u201d\u201cHmm? Al? Al isn\u2019t as good as Ufi, but I hear he\u2019s good at magic.\u201d\u201cYep. That\u2019s why the college and the sons of the aristocrats who work for the Ministry of Magic have often been welcomed.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s one of those big factions over there, too.\u201dI don\u2019t really like the way it feels to see magic as a privilege of nobility and not being able to handle civilians and magic from above. Rather, some people hate him enough to throw up backwards. Voter Ideas, Disagree!I understand that magic is a status. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s everything. I admire magic and do something about developing magic props. Though maybe it\u2019s a funny story I say. \u2018Cause this is a hobby.\u201cHas the story gone out of line? Uh, what were you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat was a mingling of perceptions of magic. Sure enough, it seemed confusing if we didn\u2019t fold it together.\u201d\u201cIt was. You were talking more about spirits and magic than magic one day. It\u2019s inseparable. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cEven if they say magic, the reality is unknown from the outside. I just hear you\u2019re often at the construction site? to sewers and street sites.\u201dUh, when I told my father about the sewer, he seriously considered it, because he asked me to be an advisor, like an assistant field supervisor, without knowing anything about it.Because if you have a sewer, you can treat the city landscape and sewage, right? Sewage can cause illness, because my father listened to me and even verified me when I told him stories like that all the time.Of course, I totally forgot I told you that, and I was suddenly made involved in a business that started after several years of consideration.I can\u2019t study it then! I thought you were outraged. Thanks to this, I have put all my efforts into the development of demonic props in construction relations. I\u2019m not reflecting.\u201cThe sewer was water in my sleeping ear, too, but because the streets show demons. The demon stone that the demon drops was the aim. So hunting demons in the name of auditing\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is the princess doing!?\u201d\u201cSounds like the princess herself is appealing to the inspection, right?\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about!? And the real deal and the pre-construction are different!\u201cWell, leave that alone. I needed demon stones, and I went to collect demon bones, skins, fangs, something that was going to be material at one end, and I was pissed off that I didn\u2019t disappear from the royal castle\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. How many times have I also noticed that I was left with only a letter and escaped? By the way, if you\u2019re going out there, you\u2019ve been sent to the streets to at least do your job.\u201dI feel nostalgic for Ilia\u2019s supplement. I used to be more like this, I wish I was free. I\u2019m calm now, too. No, sometimes it\u2019s because the research took a lot shape and validation and modification was the main thing!How do you get out of the royal castle, with the Kingsguard Knights and the soon-to-be-formed samurai squad? In a way, I feel like the Kingsguard Knights treated me like a virtual enemy exercise.\u201c\u2018Cause demon stones are degenerate spiritual stones, too, so I didn\u2019t find out enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe Demon Stone, that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? A crystal that can be taken from demons such as particularly strong individuals of demons, people with aliases\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s that magical stone that\u2019s brought into magical research or decorated as a sign of honor because it reveals its properties according to the characteristics of the species.\u201d\u201cIs that a spirit stone?!?\u201d\u201cPrecisely eating spirits and crystallizing the taken spirits into your body to enhance your race-specific power is the Demon Stone. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a perverted spirit.\u201d\u201cOh no\u2026 is that why the Demon Stone has a strange power?\u201cBecause there are a lot of accessories and things that use demon stones. Well, it\u2019s rare to have an individual.\u201dThat\u2019s why we had to hunt numbers, destroy a little herd of demons, and, you know, that happened. Oh, Ilia\u2019s gaze hurts a little. I wonder if they understand what you\u2019re thinking.\u201cThat\u2019s a spiritual stone, too, but you don\u2019t have a use for it because it\u2019s even more limited in use. It\u2019s not like we can go back to the Spirit Stone, so we\u2019ve only ever had enough use for accessories and honor.\u201d\u201cIn magic, can demon stones be used effectively?\u201cMmm. If you can\u2019t imitate it.\u201d\u201cSomething I can\u2019t imitate\u2026?\u201cSee? Well, take it off.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, take it off\u2026 hey, Dear Anis!?\u201dThen take off your jacket and let your upper body be naked. There are only women here, so there\u2019s no problem.And I look back to Uffi to show my back. As I halfway around turning only my neck, I could see Uffi circling his eyes.I think Uffi\u2019s eyes see an engraved \u201cengraving\u201d on my back. It\u2019s just a tattoo from the side, though. It is a felon to put a tattoo in this world. A custom that was left so that the sins committed could never be erased. So aristocratically, it\u2019s something to repel.\u201cIt\u2026 is it a tattoo? How could you do that?\u201d\u2018Cause this is gonna be the \u201cmagic\u201d catalyst I can use.\u201cCatalyst\u2026?\u201cYes, yes. This is paint that I brushed down and painted with demon stones. I carved this into my body, tamed it, and took the power of the Demon Stone into myself. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t imitate me.\u201d\u201cNaturally! What do you think your body is!?\u201d\u201cUh, that hand sermon is so pissed off when I carve this in, so yes, I won\u2019t do it anymore\u2026\u201dThis is one of the few \u201cmagic\u201d I can use right now. By passing magic through the engraving of the devil stone on your back, you can benefit from the engraved devil stone.I\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s something that has stained me with demonic powers rather than magic, so my father has an immediate restraining order for treating me like an evil person. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s zero danger.\u201c\u2026 ha, that His Majesty\u2019s hardship will be sneaked. So, what can you do with that engraving?\u201cMmm. Simply put, I wonder if I can gain the muscle strength of the original demon and other race-derived properties. Because you\u2019re using pretty good stuff!\u201c\u2026 what did you use for the material\u201d\u201c\u2026 when I say it, I feel like I\u2019m going to get mad\u2026!It\u2019s a dragon, Master Uphilia.Oh, Ilia! Why are you falling apart like you\u2019re making such a statement! I showed it to you!?\u201cDragon!? Dragon Demon Stone is not a national treasure Demon Stone!?\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been hunting for my life because I want it so bad!\u201cI haven\u2019t been told anything publicly.\u201d\u201cWhat are you really doing, are you!?\u201dHuh, material hunting\u2026\u2026? Uffi looked at me with a jitty eye as if such thoughts had leaked into my expression, angry or frightened.No, \u2019cause dragons are disaster-class demons. There happened to be a dragon that came across the Kingdom of Palletia, and I heard that a crusader was going to be sent out, so I used everything I could do at the time to hunt for a dragon, too, before it was made national\u2026 did I just\u2026?\u201cSo, it\u2019s okay! Because some of this can be properly external! About me to use it with engraving!\u201cIs it external\u2026?\u201cYou mean the medicine that worked out the demon stone? I have a bit of a side effect though.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI guess those around me are telling me. I guess you\u2019re not the one who stops when you say it with your mouth. Yeah, so.\u201dMr. Yufi, why are your eyes so fixed?\u201cIf you seem to be impotent in my sight, I will do everything in my power to stop you. Please be prepared.\u201d\u2026 I received a declaration of exercising my powers from one of the leading powerful in the kingdom.Yeah, I think you got a reliable assistant. It\u2019s okay, now, because I don\u2019t really have that kind of impotence anymore! Yeah, I\u2019m sure, maybe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: 8Anisphere Wynn Palettia. Princess of the Kingdom of Palettia, age seventeen. Strange behavior has been noticeable since childhood, and he was branded incompetent since he found out he couldn\u2019t use magic. It was in the last few years that the reputation of the Anisphere was overshadowed.No one gave up the right to inherit the throne from an early age, and no one would pay attention or expect her to combine with the reputation that had been pushed into the outhouse. But once in the world, the ability and heterogeneity of Anisphere became known to the world, even if I didn\u2019t like it.Commentators at the construction site for the establishment of sewers and the development of demonic props for the assistance of construction. He went on to accompany him as an auditor in the new development of the streets, instantly launching achievements such as annihilating all the hordes of demons he attacked.I thought it was the madness of incompetence, so I opened the lid and this is it. It was sometimes rumored that the king had moved to the outhouse to hide Anispheric competence. Few have tried to connect with such anispheres.Now, the truth about Anisphere\u2019s transfer to the out-of-house is the King\u2019s thoughts that directed it. That would be the answer of those close by, such as the Kingsguard Knights and the Royal Palace Samurai.It\u2019s just a pain in the ass, he said.And today and today, Anisphere runs out oddly.\u201cYufi will see this today!At the corner of the outhouse, in that square, I raised my voice to show Yufi what I had put up in my hand in front of him. Look what fits in my hand. Uffi is turning a surprise to me. It\u2019s the way I thought it would be.\u201cIs that\u2026 a sword pattern, is it? It\u2019s a little odd in shape.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m aware of the common long sword that knights use.\u201d\u201cWhy is it just the pattern?Yes. What I have in my hand is a sword pattern that doesn\u2019t exist. There is a crease in the root of the pattern, and a spiritual stone is mounted in the hole.All I can say is, if this is what it is, it\u2019s a sword pattern. Nothing more, nothing less. It is the undisputed pattern of the sword!\u201cThis is fine. This is one dish that I can proudly say is very popular and useful among the demonic items I have developed!\u201cYou\u2019ve been very anxious after this\u2026\u201dHehe, don\u2019t have such frightened eyes, Yufi. This is just the beginning, because I thought it was for Yufi, and I showed him an invention that was still very important.\u201cUffi could have used a sword, too.\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s Rapier I\u2019m using\u201d\u201cRapier. I was wondering if you\u2019d like me to show you the actual product I\u2019m actually using later.\u201d\u201cNothing good\u2026\u2026 that, what the hell is that sword pattern?\u201cIt\u2019s a magic trick, no matter what. Want to see it?I\u2019ll try to hand the sword pattern to Uffi. Surprisingly, Uffi makes observations with a sword pattern.Check the weight, or actually hold it and see. And Yufi turned his eyes to the root of the sword, the part of the temple where the Spirit Stone was fitted.\u201cThis is a spiritual stone, right? If it\u2019s a magic prop, can you use it if you pass the magic?\u201cWant to try it?\u201c\u2026 then\u201dMagic into the pattern of the sword as Yufi is urged. In response to carefully and slowly poured magic, the Spirit Stone in the Sword pattern brightens.At the next moment, the pattern of the sword, the light zeroes as if to draw a full body, as if to echo the magic of Uffi. The shaking light grew stronger and became the \u201cfull body of light\u201d.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cDemon Sword\u201d that creates selfishness with magic. Compared to normal swords, the weight of the pattern is the only one, and if necessary, the weight of the selfishness is adjustable according to the user\u2019s preference! How about one for a woman\u2019s protection!? \u201c\u201cWhy like a merchant\u2026 no, but this is\u2026 awesome. The way it looks, is it as long as the common long sword? But the weight is certainly only the weight of the pattern. Can this actually be slashed?\u201cOf course, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because it would overload the spiritual stones that are forming their own bodies when they are imminent. Oh, but if the demon swords are impending each other, I guess we\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s a by-product, but it\u2019s incredibly convenient to cut off magic without mass.\u201dAs impressed as I am, Yuffi has set up his sword to make sure he is comfortable using it. Looks like it\u2019s just a sword full of light, though. Although it has the disadvantage that it is not suitable for impending, it is less risky and more expensive. It is one of the few inventions even praised by his father for letting go.The development name \u201cMana Blade.\u201d In fact, some of the trusted royal palace maids carry it as a protective weapon. The patterned part alone can be carried, so it\u2019s easy to hide it if you put a holder on the thick crotch and give it away.\u201cWhat\u2019s the strength?\u201cThat depends on the adjustment, too. The distribution of shapes, strengths, etc. is divided and preferred. However, because Spirit Stone is used, if the Spirit Stone is overloaded and damaged, it cannot be used unless the Spirit Stone is replaced. And that\u2019s all I can do with my magic if I have more orders for my body. Current test in terms of durability years. Note that it was the shield version of Mana Shields that pleased Father more than Mana Blade. Regrettably.\u201d\u201cIs this a shield\u2026 that\u2019s useful\u201dI admit it\u2019s useful, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I wanted this Mana Blade to feel like a wanderer! By the way, only Father and Ilia have Mana Shields because they\u2019re scared to spread them. My father gave it to me as a gift for protection and to Ilia.Also, my father told me if I could make it into armor, but when it came to covering my whole body, it was difficult to adjust. Swords, shields, no range of motion. Adjustment was too difficult when it came to making it to the range of motion with armor.\u2026 No, wait? Instead of planting them all in armor, try planting Mana Shields on each part, no, you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s costly and covers the whole body. No, I don\u2019t think so.\u201cIt\u2019s not just universal because it\u2019s vulnerable to massive physical attacks. It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t work at all. Because the deterioration of spiritual stones continues.\u201d\u201cHow much mass is dangerous?\u201cIf I took a rockfall about the size of a person, it would have broken.\u201d\u201cDid you try it\u201dDistract. Hon, and cough up and face Yufi again\u2026. I never missed the point, did I?\u201cThere was something magical about making blades out of magic, like Mana Blade, wasn\u2019t there? Or Mana Blade is a reproduction of it\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have much use for it though. I was wondering if it was mainly used by those who aspire to join the Knights. However, they often say that you should normally use magic\u2026\u201d\u201cIt has to be a limited indoor space or something. Well, that\u2019s why this is gear for people who have magic, but can\u2019t use magic.\u201dMostly for me. I made it because I want to use it. I admire swinging swords made of light or something.It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t worked out her body, but what\u2019s wrong with her? Also, there were unexpected consequences of being made to hold it for the protection of the samurai, and this can be a success story among my inventions.\u201cUnattributed spiritual stones, which are usually used only for fuel, can also be used effectively.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSpiritual stones without attributes remained particularly questionable in their use because they only contained magic. It was a common method of use to crush and celebrate unattributed spiritual stones in rituals and festivals because if you just crush it, you can scatter magic into the air.After that, drugs or something? It\u2019s used as an ingredient in medicine to restore magic, but it seems to taste bad enough to die. Because of the ingredients, they couldn\u2019t do anything about the flavour.When I said I wish I could do pills or something, I was asked to have a chance to talk to the pharmaceutical researchers. The point is, we should be able to swallow it and digest it, so we talked about having it wrapped in a thin membrane and swallowed. How are you, we\u2019re in a cage with each other, so we\u2019re not looking at each other.\u201cWhat happens if this forms a body with a spiritual stone with attributes?\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass to death\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass to death\u201dReproduced. But it\u2019s a real pain in the ass!\u201cWhen I tried to wrap up the flames, the handles were about to ignite and burn, and if I tried to consolidate the water, it wouldn\u2019t blade if it remained water, and I tried to ice it, and now it froze to the handles and frostbite, and the wind broke out too difficult to adjust to stabilize. Soil? That\u2019s no different than a normal sword\u2026\u2026!Even I thought, attribute sword! But I couldn\u2019t use magic when I tried to form myself with spiritual stones with attributes.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t Yufi be able to do it? You just have to attribute it with your own magic, not spiritual stones.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. So at Uffi\u2019s request, I thought I\u2019d make you a special order.\u201d\u201cIs it to me?\u201cIf you want a sword, it\u2019s useful, right? I was wondering if I could handle surprise attacks or something, rather than using magic on my hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. Then I have a request.\u201dWith his hands on his chin, Yuffi conceived something to worry about before shrugging\u2026. to that suggestion from Ufi. I rounded my eyes and almost laughed out like crazy though.\u201cIt\u2019s great, Uffi. I knew I was right to invite you!\u201cI\u2019m just trying to say\u2026 possible, what is it?\u201cIt\u2019s against my way of saying things before I challenge the word impossible!That said I laughed to peel my teeth off. Come on, it\u2019s a fun time of trial and error!Uphilia had plenty of free time in the outhouse. From the next day, when she showed me Mana Blade, Anisphere got stuck in the workshop.Because I wanted to surprise you with anything, I was banned from entering the workshop until it took shape. I wonder if it makes sense for an assistant, but I won\u2019t even pinch my mouth if he wants to make something suggested and then give it to me.There\u2019s no education to be queen, no manners practice, no college classes. There is no such thing as pushing yourself aside as one. It was, lonely and vain, and Uphilia felt a hole hollow in her chest.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis, is it not over yet\u201dIt doesn\u2019t seem like Ilia is forgetting to sleep because she\u2019s looking after her. I don\u2019t even know what to do if I\u2019m left on a boulder.I wondered if the blur and time would pass today, Uphilia. But I heard noisy footsteps from outside the room as soon as I could.\u201cUfi! Sorry to keep you waiting! I got it!The bears are made under the eyes of the anisphere, and the hair is slightly grassy, albeit neat. But the smile remained unchanged and shady, and Uphilia exhaled unexpectedly.There is a single sword in its hand. The shape is a common rapier. There are distorted parts to cover the back of the handles, where six spiritual stones are fitted.\u201cThe full body is a magic conductor mixed with spiritual stones! Joining together and embedding the Spirit Stone improves Magic Conductivity! You won\u2019t know until you try it, but you can help yourself to attribute it! It can also be used as a magic medium like a magic wand! Demon Sword and Wand, Miracle Fusion Sword with both functions!Anisphere keeps talking with a quick mouth. Ufiria was unintentionally breathtaking to see a prototype incorporating the proposal she casually proposed.There is a wand with spiritual stones of attributes that the wizard called the wand is good at. It is an aid when using magic, and can be considered a common piece of equipment for wizards.Some put that in the shape of a weapon for protection, but so far no precedent existed: a sword. That\u2019s why Uffi\u2019s sword is an emergency weapon and has never been used in conjunction with magic.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.So I looked at Mana Blade, who developed Anisphere, and I said, The sword is good with a normal sword, so I was wondering if I could attach a function there as a magic wand.\u201cJust be careful, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a finished product yet. Put on proper protective gloves and keep your protective means as long as you can.\u201d\u201cAre you going to try it?\u201cOf course! Let\u2019s go to the square!\u201cAh, Dear Anis!?\u201dWith the tension high, he grabs Ufiria\u2019s hand and pulls on. Uphilia ran out together as she troubled herself, holding back her hand connected to the Anisphere.The sky is clear. Only Anisphere and Uphilia are in the square, and Uphilia once again takes the sword given to Anisphere and sets it up to show it.\u201c\u2026 Speaking of which, can Anis also do a blacksmith?\u201cNo, I did the design and build the patterned parts, but I outsourced myself. I know a hard-mouthed blacksmith. I always order only the pattern of the sword, so it pisses me off, but this time it\u2019s a great ride.\u201d\u201cIs that why you were out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you next time, too, Uffi. I dropped him off this time, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be treated in an evil way if I tell him I\u2019m going to tell him what I think of the sword. You really don\u2019t like nobles.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see\u201dUphilia also understands that there are civilians who dislike nobility. There are those who continue to hold grudges and jealousy because they have behaved tyrannically in the past as unreasonably abused by nobles.Many even have a wealthy life with nobility. I can\u2019t help but envy those privileged positions and raise them to evil emotions. That is why I wanted a queen to be glorified by the people for the sake of the people. Think that far. Uphilia shakes her head left and right.Now, I\u2019m not the next queen. It\u2019s just Uphilia. Touch it to stroke a sword made only for its own sake and then pass the magic through it.The feeling of being familiar with your hands comes first. It\u2019s like being a part of yourself through magic. Bring light as if you tremble in joy if you pass magic through spiritual stones.(As for the wand, I wonder if it\u2019s impeccable)Let\u2019s try it, and Uphilia shifts her gaze to Anisphere.\u201cI\u2019ll use a little magic. Please step away.\u201d\u201cCopy that. You can guess because there\u2019s a target there.\u201dTell him a word in advance, and then Uffi will work out his magic. The exercise of magic is to give a clear image to the Spirit. Magic takes shape if the Spirit correctly receives what he prays, desires, and desires.Uphilia mouths with her sword in front of her eyes as she leaps her mind slightly into the familiar sensation.\u201c\u201d Fireball \u201cThe moment the image is clearly deepened by what you said, a fireball rises from the tip of the sword and flies away.Landing. Fireballs can be played to burn the target. After seeing it through, Uphilia exhaled. Only a little force falls out of my nervous body.\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very smooth. It\u2019s easy to imagine magic exercises because you can feel spirits with spiritual stones.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look good not to chant?\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to skip chanting if it\u2019s something you\u2019re used to using. I\u2019ve heard of skilled wizards who omit even their magic names if they fit their attributes.\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, I just rang a demon, and I\u2019m going to exercise magic, and I wonder if that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all. Chanting can be omitted, but it has been proven that chanting can deepen the image and increase power and accuracy. Especially when you perform magical rituals, you have to chant. It\u2019s rather unpleasant.\u201d\u201cAs far as it goes. I don\u2019t have a real sense of empathy, but I can understand the content.\u201dYeah, yeah, and the anisphere nods in fun arms.While bitterly laughing at Anisphere, who feels she really likes magic, Ufiria decided to try her next function as the Devil\u2019s Sword.Mana Blade forms herself with magic. But now the sword in the hands of Uphilia will enchant itself and grant attributes.(Is the magic you can get in\u2026 water okay? I heard it would be difficult if you didn\u2019t turn it into ice)Fire and wind are likely to be injured, so the soil is said to be out of the question, so we should try it with water.Consciousness of magic to invite water spirits. The parts of the sword pattern, the spiritual stones of the water fitted there, return a reaction so that they resonate.The image forms itself so as to cover the sword, so that it can be covered. It\u2019s just like magic, the image matters. Close your eyes and start aiding by chanting.\u201cBody, formation. \u2026\u201d Waterblade \u201c\u201dWhen I opened my eyes, I maintained the shape of my body while the water maintained its shape so that I could see my body.Once, twice, I\u2019ll wave my sword. The shape is not likely to collapse, to the extent that some weight has been added. I accidentally raise my voice of admiration.\u201cThis is\u2026 somehow, that\u2019s interesting\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t be so shaped and all I could do was drool the water\u2026 Yufi is amazing!\u201cAh, Master Anis! It\u2019s dangerous to be suddenly jumped!Uphilia is surprised by the sudden jump of Annisphere and takes it by trying to deflect her sword aggressively.It was an anisphere that was in a good mood and with all its strength, but, uh, it became quiet and motionless as it was.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis?I wonder what happened, and Uphilia opens her eyes to Anisphere, who was about to collapse if she rocked her shoulder. When I let go of my sword and supported him, I heard him sleep.I get stunned unexpectedly. As such, Uphilia sat down and put Anisphere\u2019s head on her knee so that she could pillow her knee because she was in an aggressive position. Anisphere rests satisfactorily.\u201c\u2026 hard work, no, are you just innocent? He\u2019s like a big kid.\u201dSomeone older than me, but who looks as if he\u2019s younger than me.However, its contents are such as to embody a variety of aliases as they are. Even this sword makes it light. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any demand besides myself, but I think there might be demand for the Knights.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019ve never even done a knee pillow to Algard.\u201dUphilia laughs bitterly that she really tried too hard to be the queen and left her humanity behind.I couldn\u2019t deepen my relationship with Algard while speaking of the next queen. I can tell you that\u2019s a huge failure for me.But there is now because it failed. The fact of failure does not disappear, but the feeling of happiness that we are now able to obtain is so warm that it tickles.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a little envious of you. Dear Annis.\u201dAnispheric hair through her fingers was only slightly grassy after all. I was wondering if I should let you take a bath when I wake up. Uphilia was to spend a peaceful time watching Anisphere sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: 9After Yuffi\u2019s creation of the Devil\u2019s Sword, he was to take a break at Yuffi\u2019s request. Hmm, I realized that I was weak when asked to be straight. Ilaria\u2019s my partner, but she\u2019s basically my husband and squire.It\u2019s a more reciprocal relationship with Uffi. Though there is also an identity. So it\u2019s hard to say no when you ask me to be straight. She wanted to do research, but she told me that it was not something I would do alone.So while I was resting slowly, I decided to leave the adjustment of the Devil\u2019s Sword to Yufi and Ilia. Take your time off and if you wake up, your head is refreshed. Sleep is important, but I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201cSpeaking of which, Yuffi\u2019s Devil\u2019s Sword, I guess I should give you a name\u201dThat\u2019s not Mana Blade, though that\u2019s a weapon that applies Mana Blade technology. It\u2019s a new concept that combines the functions of the Devil\u2019s Sword and Wand. However, it is a bespoke dish for Yufi.Mm-hmm. Name, name. Also use for future development names? But it\u2019s not a mass produced product. Shall I talk to Yufi and Ilia?I ring the bell and see because even one person can be polite, but don\u2019t take the job. If Ilia moves, she\u2019ll be here soon, but if she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s up to us to wait a little while before we do our homework alone.\u201cGood morning, Princess\u201d\u201cMorning, Ilia\u201dWait a few seconds, Ilaria comes in gracefully with a gift. When Ilia can\u2019t come, it\u2019s less than enough. I can\u2019t even hear you running, but are you waiting all the time, or are you turning it off and moving even with the sound? This point of Ilia can be a bit mysterious.Ask Ilia to keep up with herself. While I had my hair combed in front of the mirror, I asked Yufi what was going on and decided to see it.\u201cHow\u2019s Uffi? How was your sword?\u201cYep. He said he liked it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s above all. Speaking of which, Yuffi\u2019s sword, should I have a name? I\u2019m not going to mass produce it, but I was wondering if I should have a name or something.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u2026 I think it would be a good idea to talk to the person as well. Because it will be mainly used by Master Uphilia.\u201dIs that true? While I was thinking about it, I decided to ask Ilia to show me to Uffi.It seems that Yufi has been waving the Devil\u2019s Sword and using magic to take all kinds of data since he got the sword. You told me to rest. I don\u2019t think Uffi could do anything about it.If I went out into the square, I could quickly find what Yufi looked like. This outfit is decorated to an unashamed degree as a lady, but emphasizes athleticism.Uffi looked back and thanked me for noticing me and Ilia approaching. I also speak to Uffi as I give him a thank you.\u201cHow you doing?\u201d\u201cYeah, very good. Waking up now?\u201cYeah. I got some rest and a good head.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s above all. Later Demon Sword reports, please do not look through them as they are available\u201d\u201cThanks, that would help!Because the opinions of the people who use them are important! Yufi is polite, and he reports to me in detail, and I can\u2019t wait to read the report for a second.\u201cOh, yeah. Yufi. Shall we name that sword?\u201cName, is it?\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a prototype, it\u2019s for practically Ufi only, but it\u2019s a piece I made, and I don\u2019t have plans right now, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any potential for mass production in the future.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t hold you, but if there is, I wonder if you\u2019ve ever crossed the line.\u201dUm, shall I name it then? What a good name.It\u2019s a demon sword that supports all kinds of attributes\u2026 lots of attributes, lots of colors\u2026 if you say rainbow, rainbow\u2026\u201cRainbow\u2026\u2026 no, arcane, shell, is that it?\u201cArcane shell? That\u2019s a good name\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, uh, yeah? Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes, Arcane Shell and I\u2019ll take your name.\u201dIf you like it, well, okay. Now the name of Yuffi\u2019s demon sword is Arcanshell!\u201cWhat do you think? Is there something you want me to tweak?\u201cRight, especially when it comes to features. I just want to make sure you don\u2019t have any precautions about taking care of your body. Because your body is special.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write down the caveats later. If anything goes wrong, tell me right away.\u201dI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good prototype. Whatever it is, it\u2019s the most horrible thing that Uffi likes and most importantly.I wonder what I\u2019ll do next.That\u2019s how I thought about it. Two, there was some shadow in the sky. I could see white doves flying when I made sure they caught me and turned my gaze. Oh, and I accidentally leak my voice. The dove flies straight towards me and stops in my hand.\u201cIs it a biographical dove?\u201cAh, this is the right time. We have to go.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis?\u201cYufi, I kind of had to go out. I was gonna pull a cage.\u201d\u201cHuh? To which?\u201cAdventurer Guild\u201dAdventurer Guild. It\u2019s not just the Kingdom of Palettia, it\u2019s a union of adventurers all over the world. Adventurers in this world are close to the store for anything. He\u2019s got everything from solving the small problems that happen on a daily basis to escorting journeys, pre-investigating the area, and crusading demons the country has bought.These days, the country also supports the Adventurer Alliance, and it is the relationship between the country and the adventurers that the adventurer has acquired as a job in stopping and resolving problems when the country cannot move or it takes time to move.\u201cWhy did you get a letter from the Adventurer Alliance?\u201cI think it\u2019s a crusade request because I\u2019m an adventurer and I\u2019m a high-ranking adventurer.\u201d\u201cWhy is the royal family registering adventurers?!? That\u2019s also high rank!?\u201d\u201cWhen I was working on the streets and stuff, I thought I should keep it\u2026\u201dLook, it\u2019s faster to sell materials and turn them to the Adventurer Guild, and with a part-time feel to your pennies\u2026\u2026As I pondered the excuse, a cold gaze from Uffi exhaled from Ilia.\u201cAs it were, well, there you go. It\u2019s your mission as a royal family to move ahead and prevent a crisis, right?\u201cIt\u2019s better for you to hunt and wholesale to your guild in order to keep the material to yourself.\u201d\u201cDear Anis\u2026\u201dUh, uh, I can\u2019t hear you. I can\u2019t hear you.I wonder what more than that. I find it quite a hassle to deliberately request a high-ranking adventurer. Which\u2026?\u201c\u2026 stampede,\u201dMass occurrence of demons. And the phenomenon it comes overflowing with swarms is stamped. I do think this is enough to summon high-ranking adventurers.Stampede can be caused more or less by demons with demonic stones growing rapidly. Stampede There is a named class demon somewhere. Stampede itself is a problem, but you can say the problem lies ahead.If so, the highly-ranked adventurer really has a voice. Solution of the stampede itself and crusade for the cause that caused it to occur. This is the main way to deal with stampede when it occurs.Of course, the Knights of the Country move if they say it\u2019s a stampede, but the first move is really delayed. If so, the usual trend is for adventurers to step out first.\u201cDid the stampede happen?\u201cSounds like it. So I\u2019m just gonna go.\u201d\u201cAre you going\u2026 yourself?!?\u201dUffi opens his eyes and reveals his surprise. I know, I know what you\u2019re trying to say. It\u2019s ridiculous to jump into the scene even though you\u2019re royal, or you can\u2019t call it princely behavior! I know that, but yeah!\u201cStampede is all the materials you can hunt! Grab it!\u201dIt comes out so overflowing, it\u2019s Fever Time for me to acquire material!Unexpectedly grip his fist hard and theorize. Stampede is a chance to recover not only the material from the overflowing demons, but also the powerful solid demon stones that started it! It\u2019s a golden opportunity for adventurers!I basically cover the cost of my research myself. Signing up for the Adventurer Guild can also be part of the gold measure. All you have to do is give your father the information on the lower town and get a penny, or you can pay a certain amount of budget from the work of magic that I provided.So you can\u2019t miss this opportunity!\u201cIlia! Nice to be away!\u201cYou\u2019re always right. Yes, sir.\u201dIlaria\u2019s holding her forehead in sigh. I\u2019m sorry I have a headache Lord, but when I can gather the material! And it\u2019s true that Stampede itself can\u2019t be left alone. Because I\u2019m not complacent that I\u2019m the only one who can fix it, but it\u2019s also true that it would be easier if I went.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll come too\u201d\u201cHuh? And Yufi?\u201cIs it necessary for the study of magic? Then my assistant has the right to accompany me, too, right?\u201c\u2026 um, well, because if I stop here, I won\u2019t tell you and we\u2019ll talk. You can protect yourself, can\u2019t you?\u201cI was accompanied by the Knights, but I have experience crusading demons\u201dYufi looks straight at me as I reach for Arcane Shell and says:\u2026 Well, stopping it rubs my mind, and it\u2019s a waste of time asking questions. They leave us in the material acquisition competition as it is!\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s go together, Uffi!\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWell, wait a minute! Because I\u2019ll bring you something to keep!\u201cYes!\u2026 Yes? Master Anis, what do you think you\u2019re going to have?Hehe, that\u2019s the line everyone wants to say once, right, this!\u201cI was wondering if this could happen! I had it ready!At the corner of the square, one of the warehouses connected directly from the workshop. Open the door and let the sunlight shine on the 'sole\u201d you left inside.\u201c\u2026 what is this? Ship\u2026?Uffi leaning back after me. At the same time, you\u2019re pulling on that look, or you\u2019re not looking well anywhere. Well, I can see that, too.In the knowledge of previous life, this is close to a \u201cmotorboat\u201d. However, the unusual thing is that the \u201chull\u201d is made of \u201cdragon\u2019s jaw\u201d.I\u2019m putting the dragon\u2019s jaw backwards and assembling parts to be a hull there. I put a \u201crudder\u201d on here for control, and there it is.\u201cThis is it! Prototype No. 6 of my flying magic props, created using dragon materials! That name\u2019s also Airdra!\u201cFlying magic props\u2026\u2026 this, do you fly!?\u201d\u201cThe power is the Spirit Stone of the Wind! A ship that uses dragon jaws, bones, scales, etc. to propel a pseudo-reproduced\u201d dragon exhale \u201dinto the sky!The truth is, I thought I\u2019d even make a motorcycle for long distance travel, but you couldn\u2019t make tires and you refused. There were wheels and street problems. And that\u2019s where I came up with my fantasy unique air bike!I had an idea before I made Airdra, but it was this Airdra who made repeated demonic modifications using dragon materials that I was \u201clucky\u201d to get!Excellent to gain buoyancy with the Spirit Stone of the Wind and use it as a propulsion by carving dragon demon stones into the hull to pseudo-reproduce exhalation!\u201cCome on, get in, get in! Yufi!\u201d\u201cOh, are you really going with this?!?\u201d\u201cTime contends for a moment, my material is at stake!\u201cYou wanted me to worry about something else there a little more\u2026\u2026!Use the trolley to take Airdra outside. Hold the rudder as you put Uffi behind you. Through the rudder, begin to shed the necessary magic on the hull.I accidentally smile at my mouth, making sure that the light shines on my \u201ctattoo\u201d to transmit magic to the hull.Uffi, hold on tight.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cThen Ilia, I\u2019m coming!\u201cPrincess, Master Uphilia, be careful\u201dIlia deeply appreciates and distances herself at a glance. I fall in love unexpectedly with that very early work. Behind me, Yufi seemed somewhat surprised as she cling to me.\u201cUh, why Ilia, run, that?\u201cSpirit stone, magic fill complete. Start floating\u2026\u2026 confirm takeoff! Bow angle adjustment, angle good!\u201c Dragon Exhale (Airbrace) \u201c, counting down to launch! 5, 4, 3\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, hey Dear Anis!? I have a bad feeling\u2026!?\u201d\u201cAirdra, braceburst! Fire!!\u201dPoop! Knock in the magic so I can switch it on and activate the magic prop.Braces were fired from the rear of the hull with a roar that also resembled a dragon hissing as it pushed its hull from behind, a bow pointing away from the ground at an angle to the sky with a windy spiritual stone.The irresistible hull gains its exhaling momentum to gain propulsion. Keep going to the sky, to the sky! Airdra, who had us on board as if it were a cannon bullet, rose to the universe.\u201cYes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!? Again?I hear a scream of Uffi coming from behind, but no scream of Uffi came into my brain. It was because I was in love with the view of the sky thrusting by Airdra.\u201cHaha! hahaha! I knew the sky was good. No, no, no!Inject magic into the hull and take the rudder. \u201cDragon scales\u201d affixed to the surface of the hull or redirected by windy spiritual stones. The goal of this is the destination where the stampede occurred!\u201cYufi! Don\u2019t bite my tongue! I\u2019ll fly!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already flying \u2013 whoa!!\u201dThe deep great forest that exists in the Kingdom of Palletia, the name \u201cBlack Forest\u201d.If you go to the depths by the depressed and lush trees, it will be dark enough not to shed light on the sun, and it is therefore told that the name given to it is the Black Forest.It is one of the flocks of the Spirit and is also known as the region of the Spirit Stone. At the same time, it is famous for its many demonic habitats, the daily food of the adventurers and the regular survey teams of the Knights.Such a black forest had a roaring sound.It\u2019s not uncommon for stampedes to happen in the Black Forest and demons to overflow. Adventurers and knights usually hunt demons as a measure of this, but it still doesn\u2019t come true to prevent it completely.And this time again, the adventurers who perceived the foretaste of stampede told the Adventurer Guild of the occurrence of stampede, and the adventurers and the knights who were staying to protect the neighboring villages were rushing to prepare for the crusade.\u201cHurry up! Hurry up the evacuation of the villagers! Pull the line! By the time Stampede arrives!\u201cWhat\u2019s the scale of this one?!?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fail to prepare your medicine!\u201cHey, out of the way! Watch out!Anger echoes and everyone rushes around to prepare for the upcoming battle. It was the new American adventurers who were coming to gain experience in the Black Forest that narrowed their shoulders in such a frenzy that there seemed to be no place to go.\u201cDuh, what are you gonna do\u2026?\u201cWhat are we gonna do\u2026 Stampede?\u201cIf they catch you from behind where you fled, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s better to stay here and fight with you. You have a better chance of survival.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening from the outset\u2026 too bad luck!The only evil that comes out of your mouth is if you worry about the status quo. From here on out is next to death. The original plan was to get daily food from demonic extermination and spiritual stone mining in a relatively shallow place. It\u2019s only unlucky, such as suddenly getting caught up in a massive demonic crusade.From afar comes roaring and thoughtful voices and sounds like a grunt. It also stirs the fears of the adventurers. My legs tremble, my stomach feels narrower and smaller, and my heart is so disturbed that I still want to escape.\u2013 My anxiety nearly smeared my mind, that\u2019s exactly when.\u201c\u2026 something? Can\u2019t you hear me?\u201cSound? You heard me earlier! The demons are coming this way!\u201cNot so! What is this, a huge, stupid roar\u2026\u201dAn adventurer who bumps into frustration, even as he surprises his fellow man who stopped to clear his ears. But the adventurer, whose ears were clear, also looked suspicious again, and changed the direction of his gaze.That\u2019s the opposite of the Black Forest. It seemed to come from the rear of the village. Unexpectedly narrow your eyes and stare. I was wondering if something like a little black dot was looming.\u201cHey, have you got anything from over there?\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, look, the sound is getting louder!?\u201d\u201cAre you serious?!?\u201dAnd the black dots that were floating in the sky loom with tremendous momentum, revealing their appearance.A strangely shaped 'ship\u201d and a thought shadow, it\u2019s falling into the sky and approaching this way. If we get closer, we can clearly hear the roaring noise earlier. It\u2019s so incredible, and so disastrous.What is that? Everyone speaks. The black dot keeps making a roaring sound and spreads the wind vigorously. Keep slowing down\u2026\u2026\u201cI forgot about the landing. Ahhhhhhhhh! Get out of the way!!\u201dLand as many ships as you wish to tap into the earth and stop even as you jump several times.Everyone puts their eyes to the odd ship. Two girls came down from that ship. Both groaning with their hands and feet on the ground.\u201cUgh\u2026 P\u2026!\u201cYufi! Hold on! If I throw up here, there\u2019s a crisis of maiden dignity!Put your hands on your back so that the girl who is still comparatively healthy can encourage the girl to squat with a bright blue face. Someone squeaked pompously watching the situation change as it was.\u201c\u2026 No way\u2026! This strange ship that flies through the sky and thinks something, strange that just seems out of common sense, just pathetic in appearance\u2026\u2026!\u201c\u201d Marauder Princess of Hunting \u201c?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s\u201d Marauder Princess of Hunting \u201c!! At least call me Mad, with Mad!!\u201dNot convinced or aliased girl, no, the princess of this country. The person, Anisphere Wynn Palettia, spoke out of indignation.Moments, cheered out of the adventurers. Everyone is happy with the advent of Anisphere with their hands up. On the contrary, it is the Knights who have a bitter worm-bitten look.\u201cMarauder\u2019s here! What a stampede, not enough to be afraid of!\u201cHey, don\u2019t get too forward! If you take the princess\u2019s share, we\u2019ll be hunted!\u201cYou demons get poor eyes again\u2026\u2026! My chest is getting hot\u2026!\u201cThe princess is here! Now you can win!!\u201d\u201cMy rating is terrible!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t you deserve it?Pompous and Uphilia squeaks while making her complexion look bad next to the anisphere.The Knights are furious to stir up the boiling adventurers. Anisphere turns her gaze to the Black Forest without looking concerned about the condition.\u201cCome on, Uffi! You will be supported by magic from behind with the Knights!\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis?On a bad feeling I don\u2019t know a few more times. Uphilia pulls her mouth and looks at Anisphere. On the other hand, the look that Anisphere gave me is a full grin.\u201cWell, I\u2019m coming! Keep the Knights under siege!\u201cUm, no way, but Dear Anis!?\u201d\u201cFever Tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!! It\u2019s time to hunt for the material. Ahhh!!\u201dI thought I raised one hand, and Anisphere ran out to the woods alone in a straight line. For a moment, it was Ufiria who shook off its back, but she shook her body and shouted like she couldn\u2019t stand it right away.\u201cDo you have a princess who goes into Stampede all by herself?!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: 10Stampede is a common occurrence factor in which demons with demonic stones suddenly increase their power and surrounding demons are affected to move in groups.For the demons, it is an escape to survive, and in order to survive, we must aim for a new heaven and earth. It\u2019s only natural to be desperate to survive.If I dare to tell the demons. Suppose they were unhappy when they jumped out of the Black Forest to escape the threat. That must have been the reality that \u201cdemons become material\u201d. And would anyone who prunes the material be here?\u201cMassive, massive\u2026! Not on a pretty big scale this time!Anisphere saw a crowd of demons overflowing with a grin. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s slightly over 3 digits just looking at it. It\u2019s pretty big, too, as a stampede.Still, the expression on Anisphere\u2019s face was a joy. There is no fear there. I only recognize the existence of demons as \u201cmaterial\u201d.\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t come out of the woods, but I can\u2019t help but tell you guys. Because it\u2019s this way that I\u2019m in trouble if I don\u2019t hunt more than I\u2019ve come out of it. So \u2013 I\u2019ll use it for a meaningful purpose. Come on!! Come at me!!\u201dAnisphere distorts too much grin of joy. Usually, hunting on this scale, for example, makes me angry that it\u2019s excessive, but if it\u2019s stampede, it doesn\u2019t seem excessive. Because leaving them is overwhelmingly more detrimental.That\u2019s why I\u2019m forgiven. \u2026 In the first place, we can refer to Stampede as \u201cmaterial grasping\u201d, which is the idea of a stranger/freak like Anisphere when it comes to world wide, and we can\u2019t even be aware of material or anything in dealing with overflowing demons.But there can be exceptions anywhere in the world. And the ravages by Anisphere began.\u201cHey silly, let\u2019s go for real this time\u2026\u2026!Anispheres pass their magic through the \u201cengraving\u201d engraved on their backs. Melting the dragon\u2019s demonic stone, the engraving that houses the dragon\u2019s power devours and empowers the magic of Anisphere as a price.More than usual, to draw more power than usual. Eventually a blurry aura emerges to cover the anisphere.It is possessed by the body of the anisphere, as it pictures the horns of the dragon or the nails. The color and pupils of the anisphere\u2019s eyes change, turning longitudinally into torn, reptile-squirted eyes.If you draw the dragon\u2019s power, the closer you draw it, the closer you go to it. It can also be described as a kind of curse. resentment of those who slaughtered themselves, and with respect. As if to say whether it is a dragon or a strong one as well.\u201cYikes\u2026\u2026 uhhhhhh!!\u201dMana Blade was placed on both hands where the body strengthening by engraving was tamed, and Anisphere kicked the ground. Poured with the magic of the Anisphere, Mana Blade unfolds the blade of magic.You noticed the approaching Anisphere, the gaze of the demons was directed at the Anisphere all at once \u2013 and its neck was dropped from the demon in the front row with its gaze. But that doesn\u2019t stop Anisphere.\u201cOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.\u201dThe blade of Mana Blade in both hands casually drops the demon\u2019s neck one after the other. Like that, it\u2019s like a circle dance. The herd of demons, all at once stepped into its center, jumped the necks of the demons dressed as if they were spinning.Even if we try to delay one hand and slaughter the anisphere so that the demons can jump, if we approach it, it will be cut off and fall to the ground. Another casual step like stepping on a skip, Anisphere drops the demon\u2019s neck.\u201cGraywolf, Killer Ape\u2026\u2026 Ah, there was Cocatrice too! Yikes! Nice no!\u201dAnisphere trembles with a tranced grin. I was wondering how much nostalgia would moisturize if I could recover all this material.But such anisphere joy will be watered down. The demons who tried to fly toward the Anisphere set foot on the demons that turned them into the slaughtered carcasses of the Anisphere.\u201cHey.\u201dAnisphere turned off her grin when she saw it. Lightly, I can get rid of the impending demons by stroking them into cuts.\u201cThe material hurts!!\u201dYou responded to Anisphere\u2019s anger, and Mana Blade\u2019s blade in both hands grows in momentum. Anisphere swung the blade horizontally out so that it revolved around herself.The body of a bunch of demons falls to the ground, dimensioned as if space had slammed up and down. Seeing a sight that instantly turned into a hell painting, Anisphere frowned.\u201cShit. The way you cut it now reduces the amount of material you can use!?\u201dFailure, failure and. Anisphere groans at her usual rate everywhere. You felt instinctive fear of such an anisphere, the demons try to intimidate but distance themselves from the anisphere.Distanced, Anisphere looks at the herd of demons with a grin on its face again as she returns the length of Mana Blade\u2019s fullness.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why don\u2019t you call me back? Otherwise, there will be a follow-up. And then you\u2019re gonna lose my share? Look, hey, if you\u2019re not coming, come on\u2026! You just have to go from me!!\u201dAnisphere turns into a whirlwind again as he boils his business down to the demons who are not close, and the demons are cast down. You recognize the threat of an existence called Anisphere, the demons begin to flee trying to distance themselves from the Anisphere.Anisphere is not as sweet as trying to miss it. Catch up on the backs of demons trying to escape immediately and pierce the blade of magic.\u201cDon\u2019t run away! You\u2019re going to lose your efficiency!!\u201dHe raises his indignation and jumps to the demons as Anisphere chases him.\u201cOh, it\u2019s still horrible\u2026!\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u201cThe Hunting Looter Princess.\u201d \u201cMarauder Princess.\u201d\u2026 \u201c\u201cI don\u2019t know which one is the demon\u2026\u2026!\u201cDon\u2019t rush! Get in line, don\u2019t be lazy! If you get there too soon, you\u2019ll be eaten by fewer marauders!The adventurers, who watched such anispheres from a distance, were fighting terror. Even as you advance your preparation, you will not be dazzled by merit and brave.The demons of today are the prey of Anisphere. If you get your hands on it poorly, you might get eyes on Anisphere. From the Anisphere herself, I guess I gently flush that Fever Time is over, but no one here knows what she thinks like that.Seeing Anisphere fighting hard to dance and dance, Uphilia found strength in her hands with nature.Strong. By the time it\u2019s overwhelming, too. The figure of Anisphere running around endlessly and slaughtering the fleeing demons is too far apart. Another demon sword in both hands jumps the demon\u2019s neck.Just shake it once to prune one life. Sometimes at once, and even showing physical ability to crush demons with kicks, not just swords. If you think that\u2019s the power of the dragon engraving you saw the other day, it\u2019s a terrific thing to say.That\u2019s a dragon. You can\u2019t deny anything if a dragon rides over and tells you it\u2019s rampant in a person\u2019s face. It was an overwhelming sight by then.\u201c\u2026 I, I didn\u2019t have to come all the way\u2026?Anisphere was so overwhelming that Uphilia accidentally thought so.Is that guy crazy? That\u2019s a fuzzy thought. I can\u2019t use magic on anispheres. Magic is the status of an aristocrat, and everyone looks if the magic available is diverse and powerful.He didn\u2019t have any such magic. I didn\u2019t have it, which is why I created it. That achievement is here and now. Uphilia thought she was scared of that. Her idea is, how far will her power stretch?\u201c\u2026 magic is a terrible thing\u201dIs this one of them? I remember the words Anisphere used to say. I don\u2019t know if I fear Anisphere because magic is horrible, or because it is magic produced by Anisphere. Maybe it\u2019s both, not one.What drives Anisphere that far? What is magic created because magic could not be used?I just couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it. Fear but still stare at the anisphere. I wonder how that guy \u2013 is so alive and happy.Where Uphilia\u2019s consciousness was possessed by thought in that way, a roar echoed.If you raise your face to see what it sounds like, something will come out of the depths of the Black Forest. That\u2019s huge enough now to compare to the demons that have overflowed here.The roar echoes. It\u2019s a cry that freezes those you hear in fear. The figure looked a lot like a person, but it was too distorted for a person. Seeing the appearance, Uphilia breathed.\u201cIs that\u2026 OGA!?\u201dAuga. It is a subracial demon feared as a cannibal. A dangerous species for humans to the point of being designated as an immediate crusade if found.Its body is far larger than that of a human being, and there are countless traces of blood on a stick like Marutai. The face was distorted as if he was laughing ugly when he saw people gathered.It\u2019s an aug that prefers people\u2019s meat, but it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t eat other creatures. That was definitely why it would be that auga that caused the Black Forest stampede.Such an orga found and recognized humans as bait. A frizzy chill rushes around the spine of Uphilia on that fact.\u201cSo, big\u2026!\u201cThat\u2019s a\u201c named \u201dclass orga! Even the usual species are troublesome!\u201cThat thing would be devastated if people were approaching you!?\u201d\u201cStampede would have been better\u2026!Because of the stampede, I was able to notice the presence of Auga. That could have been said to be fortunate in misfortune. He said if Auga hadn\u2019t stampeded in the Black Forest and had come straight down to people, it might have been more tragic.On the other hand, it makes noise as if the demons poked a hive at the emergence of an orga. From behind, there is an auga looming, and in front there is an anisphere. It\u2019s like being pinched.\u201c\u2026 Ugh, august. It seems like it can only be used for materials like Demon Stone.\u201dAnisphere in such a vortex, but it obviously entailed more and more air. There is no such thing as hunting demons as delight until earlier.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.There are few subracial demons that can be used as materials. Therefore, the anisphere\u2019s motivation was significantly shredded. But it was clearly dangerous to fight an orga in a vortex of stampede. When the damage is undoubtedly greater in such a brawl.\u201c\u2026 is Fever Time over, or what? I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dJesus Christ, exhale when I tell you. Anisphere walking out with the ease of even going for a walk.The demons did not try to get close, but instead it was the ogre who had packed the distance. He comes out sick trying to eat and scatter the humans who were beside him first.Anisphere dodges such an aug assault, jumping straight up and slamming the kick into the side as much as she wants.Anispheric kicked augs glide through the ground in momentum and are pushed back to the forest entrance. Landed Anisphere screams as she restarts Mana Blade in both hands.\u201cKnights and Adventurers! I\u2019ll take the Auga! I\u2019ll take care of Stampede!! Okay? I took it on! So, in this place, in this fight! Try not to die! That\u2019s it!!\u201dUphilia sees Anisphere\u2019s back in a strongly shouted word.Even if she\u2019s a freak, a freak, and she doesn\u2019t seem very queen. Still, Anisphere Wynn Palettia is royal. Even if she doesn\u2019t want the throne, she ends up standing for the people, whatever the motive.That\u2019s kind of funny, and Uphilia lost her shoulder strength. Pull out the arcane shell that was sitting on your hips. And speak to the knight who was nearby.\u201cIf you there. Is Her Royal Highness always in that condition?\u201cHuh? Oh, yes. Well, it\u2019s the most dangerous place you can take it.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s our job to keep this stampede.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah\u2026. I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but could you possibly be the Duke of Ufilia Magenta?\u201cHehe, can you still stay down? It\u2019s like a social tour.\u201d\u201cSocial tour!? Duke\u2019s Lady in this situation?!\u201d\u201cWhat are you wasting your mouth on! We\u2019re gonna control the stampede!From afar comes the wrath of the knights\u2019 summarisers and thoughtfully elderly knights. Uphilia takes a step as she smiles at the knight who stuck her shoulder over it.I don\u2019t know much about confusion. There is no prediction of the future when such a ruinous thing is done. Uphilia realizes that she is horrible, but expects something.\u201cYou\u2019re really a chicken, you\u2019re a blind person to look at\u201dI was wondering if we could catch up at all. Put magic into Arcane Shell. Ufiria prepares to unleash magic. Now, realizing that this is where I fight.I\u2019m not honest with Auga. Orga\u2019s magic stones don\u2019t seem to be very effective in magic, so it doesn\u2019t taste good to collect them and keep them on hand.They say it was Fever time for the material hunt in the corner, but it decreases as they try to be motivated. It\u2019s a threat, but it\u2019s not like they can\u2019t do it. Instead, he\u2019s someone I can afford to repel, and I think I\u2019ll finish my sawdust and let him go home.In the midst of the battle with Auga, he sends his gaze sideways to the fuzz. Magic pervades the herd of demons one after the other. What stands out in it is Uphilia, after all. I see her taking the lead and taking over one demon after another.\u2026 I wonder if I can even get the material for what Uphilia defeated. Thinking about it, I might be able to quench the grievances that usually make me less of a part of dealing with big guys. Well, if I run out of roots, the other adventurers are in trouble, so I have to keep them on track.\u201cIf I had more free money to spend, I wouldn\u2019t even bother to come and take my job away.\u201dIt\u2019s not like I want to fight. I am a researcher for what I am. So I\u2019m just traveling here because I can get the material cheap and I can get the money. It\u2019s not called Battlemania.And if something that would also be a princess were to pop up on the front line and hunt demons, I wonder if they could tell me that I\u2019m not royal or something, what a plan.I can afford enough to think like that. Now I can\u2019t fall apart with a \u201cnamed\u201d aug or so. Although it may be pathetic to compare it to a dragon, I feel paralyzed once I go through that fight.\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t help it.\u201dCome on, it\u2019s time to dismantle and go. Never mind. I can focus on Mana Blade, who holds both hands.Auga is at your disposal. It\u2019s beyond human physical ability to say it\u2019s in your power, and that power is enough to crush you. So basically, it\u2019s important not to hit it.Observe your surroundings, observe your opponent, read the situation and predict behavior. In the past, I\u2019m going to fix the difference with the orga I was fighting to bring it closer to my ideal feeling.I like this feeling of immersion. Feels like assembling and completing a pieced puzzle. Another one, another one, disappears.\u201c- Definition, Start Proof\u201dThe movement matches the ideal. Thoughts and sensations, the blow of beating down the orga that showed its unanimity, was unleashed as ideally.Skip your neck by Mana Blade, who swung it out in a counterfeit mood. The body of the orga who lost his head is frightened, and he falls as if he remembers it with tremor.\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t want to hurt me to collect the material and stick around to jump my neck. Would it have been easier to take him down if he hadn\u2019t been in custody?If you confirm that the Auga has fallen, the demons will run away trying to get back into the woods like they will bypass me. It was like a river running around avoiding me.If you want to escape, don\u2019t you have to chase me? Fine, I\u2019ve lost count. I guess I\u2019m pulling into the back of the woods for a while, even if it\u2019s not stampede.\u201cOne job, one end,\u201dReturn Mana Blade\u2019s blade to magic to fit in the holder. So you finally lose your mind, exhale naturally and loudly.Stop the magic supply to the engraving and go to its usual state. The feeling that the engraving is twitchy and has a fever increases the mood. It\u2019s usual to stay a little expensive until the fever goes out.Cheers echo from all around. The Knights, all the adventurers are shouting. Well, if you say stampede, it\u2019s a crusade for life. I\u2019m not complacent, but you would have struggled harder without me, I suppose.\u201c\u2026 I knew it was better for me to live freely like this\u201dI can\u2019t give up what\u2019s wrong with all this, even if they say it\u2019s not royal. At a distance you can reach, protect what you are likely to reach. I want to pursue whatever I want and get it on my own.I don\u2019t want to be respected, I don\u2019t want to be fu. I just want to live with as much happiness as I want and as much as I want. That way of life suits me, Anisphere Wynn Palettia.\u201c\u2026 Come on, we need to retrieve the material!Wait, Materials! And now the reward! I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at the thought that I couldn\u2019t contain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: 11Both Stampede and the crusade for the \u201cnamed\u201d class of Auga that caused it were successfully completed. Even though I said a named orga, he crusaded me before I got a formal name.The collection of demonic stones and materials was also decided in discussion with the adventurers and representatives of the Knights. I was the biggest contributor, so after I took my share, it was distributed across the board with merit and so on. It has always been the same way so far.Just because you can get cheap materials, you don\u2019t earn rough money like the adventurers are eating up. I will only take what I need as a material and what I will wholesale to the guild for redemption, after which I will leave it to everyone else. That was my usual way.When the discussion was over, I tried to get back to Royal Castle with Airdra as soon as possible, but Yuffi refused to do everything in his power to do this. I can\u2019t get on a ride without thinking about stopping.Uffi didn\u2019t shake his neck vertically, although it was difficult but he didn\u2019t have to stop. So I decided to ask the Knights to rent a carriage to carry supplies.It\u2019s not a quick journey! That\u2019s why I\u2019m on my way back to Royal Castle with Airdra and a pile of my share of material. He said he could do it himself, but a few escorts were put on the boulder, including a princess and a duke\u2019s wife riding in a carriage and returning.So I am allowed to relax on the carriage. I\u2019m not lonely because I have Uffi beside me. Uffi has a blurry view of the outside, somewhere out of his mind.\u201cAre you tired, Uffi?\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201dThey tell me to be nothing if I speak up. It seems clear to me that it was not my heart that I said it.If I were a normal lady, I might still be tired because it was just something I wouldn\u2019t experience. Yuffi would tell you not to worry about it, but I guess I\u2019ll just worry about it.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cMaster Anis, do you have dreams?\u201cA dream?\u201dIt\u2019s abrupt again, I think. If you turn your eyes to Uffi, you\u2019ll tangle with the gaze that was looking straight at me.\u201cI have a lot of dreams. It\u2019s my dream to study magic so I can do all sorts of things.\u201d\u201cMagic can\u2019t use magic. I studied it so that Master Anis could use magic, right?\u201cYeah, I am. Well, that\u2019s not all.\u201d\u201cYou think there\u2019s anything else?\u201cMagic is handy, isn\u2019t it?Ask Yufi. I wonder what she thinks about magic now that she\u2019s been touching it and seeing one end of it.\u201cI want to see a world where this is easier and more usable than me. I was wondering if the people who live in this world, other than me, would do things I didn\u2019t think they would do in magic. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find the meaning of being born in this world if I see such a sight.\u201d\u201cMeaning of birth, is it?\u201cAm I weird? It\u2019s not even royal, the feeling is uneven somewhere, weirdo. I\u2019ve become a stranger because I want to, but I feel like I just had to be.\u201dSometimes I put up with it at first. Because he\u2019s royal. Though I didn\u2019t keep any of that.I want to be free. But don\u2019t take it personally. The title royalty is a commandment to me. I\u2019m just staying in a birdcage in the frame of a country if I want.I never thought that would be unfortunate. I just think you\u2019re just a little incapacitated. I\u2019m protected by a birdcage. I have a sense of consciousness.\u201cBecause if you\u2019re not like others, if that\u2019s what nobody can imitate, then I want to believe it makes sense there. So I want to be like me. I want to study magic. More ahead, more convenient, more awesome stuff!\u201cIs that what Lady Annis dreams about?\u201cYes! I want to see the sight of my glimpse in this world and the moment something new is born!It\u2019s boring not to have a change. It doesn\u2019t suit me that I\u2019m not essentially a person in this world to live the way I do. If you can\u2019t accompany the world like that, I\u2019ll have to change the world. Because otherwise I\u2019m dying of a stuffy breath.It\u2019s a terrible way to put it, but you can give it to someone who wants status. I don\u2019t need to qualify as a king. I don\u2019t want to be king. Well, I don\u2019t even think you should sit on the throne with someone who doesn\u2019t deserve a minute. There is a degree of patriotism.\u201cFor example, what do you think would happen if this Airdra was in the hands of more civilians?\u201cIs this magic prop\u2026?\u201cMuch faster than a carriage if you can make it to your journey feet. Distribution may accelerate and expand. They may be able to deliver food that can only be eaten in the region. Villages communicate with each other in the country! Don\u2019t you think this is the only way to spread your dreams?\u201c\u2026 would also have a significant impact on the operation of the Knights\u201d\u201cYeah, demand means supply is required! Magic is good if it has magic, even civilians can make magic props. That also leads to good offices for the job. If a man works, the kingdom moisturizes, and if the kingdom moisturizes, the people will have wealth. That\u2019s what makes the country rich and stronger again and again! Even the day when the Kingdom of Palletia is called the Kingdom of Invention is not so far away!If you only talk about your dreams, I hope the day comes when you can see such a sight. There are many problems that need to be cleared for this, and I don\u2019t know if reality will go the way it wants. Still, one step at a time is fine. I want to go for that ideal.That\u2019s why I\u2019m royal. I don\u2019t want to be king, but I want to be part of the royal family. Because it is easier to give opinions to the country. I think Father is the ideal boss in that regard. Tighten it moderately and spread it out for the people as a feat of their own moderation. For that matter, I\u2019m giving you a lot of hard work.I have a sense of annoyance. And to be honest with you, when you say father, you have a faint feeling. Because that guy has a strong sense of being a boss to me. For a family, the divider called royalty is really far from the warmth I want.But I think that\u2019s good. At least something that\u2019s seriously going broke? If you don\u2019t, Father and I aren\u2019t going to change it from the way we\u2019re dating now.I noticed that Fu and Yufi looked worried. And Pottori and Uffi squirm.\u201c\u2026 I was raised as the next queen to support the king. I\u2019ve been trying to be that way myself. You\u2019re nothing like me.\u201d\u201cYufi is an honorary student. You don\u2019t do anything out of shape like me. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really far away. I saw you today and thought: Strength, mindset, goals. Everything is different from me\u2026\u201dUffi strayed from my gaze with her worried eyes. Uh-huh, something doesn\u2019t seem like a very good trend. Yufi looked at me and thought I was inferior.Normally, you have excellent magic, nobility, and the elegance of being raised as the next queen! I mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s connected to Yuffi\u2019s confidence right now.Because Al-Kun broke me there and hurt me. People can\u2019t stand if they break their core. Other than that, if you don\u2019t have the core to support it.The Queen is the Mother of the Nation who does all she can for her country. So I don\u2019t need more personality than I need. If only it were gear that goes around for the country. It still conflicts with what is required as the head of the country even though he is a human being. It is my belief that it is the royal duty to live on such a plank.I don\u2019t think Uffi had any other core. I didn\u2019t have the time or opportunity to be able to grow other cores. Maybe Yufi didn\u2019t even try to ask for it. Maybe there I worked salt into my wound unconsciously.I just wanted to show you my dreams and tell you that there are plenty of possibilities to look forward, even if I don\u2019t feel the same way about Yufi.Um, and. After getting a little lost, I embarked on getting closer to Uffi.Uffi, who was out of sight, looks at me. With my hand on such a yuffy cheek, I dropped my mouth on her forehead.\u201c\u2026 huh?Draws me to my chest to hold Yuffi\u2019s head, which leaks his voice flashly. To wrap it up, stroke the back of Uffi\u2019s head holding it in gently to handle the broken goods.\u201cGood boy, good boy\u201dHe strokes his head repeatedly as he whispers in Uffi\u2019s ear. Does Uffi stay surprised or not move?\u201cYou did your best.\u201dI think I\u2019m working really hard. He\u2019s younger than me, and unlike me, he didn\u2019t hold a heterogeneous soul. I just stuck it up with my talent. I have been disciplining myself to live with that qualification and that it should be.I can\u2019t laugh at that effort. That it\u2019s as valuable as the passion I\u2019ve put into magic. Empathy is not possible, but its value can be acknowledged.\u201cSo you\u2019re a good kid, a reward for a good kid. So you can hope.\u201dYufi worked hard. I tried to be what I wanted, and I couldn\u2019t be. That\u2019s not why that much effort disappears.So I reached out. Because Yufi\u2019s talent was spared. I need her to stay broken in the future. In my dreams, I thought I could go higher and higher.So reward the hard-working child. I think it\u2019s something I can do for you to keep trying.\u201cAll of Uffi\u2019s efforts are acknowledged. Some people won\u2019t like it because they won\u2019t admit it, or because they will. But Uffi is not alone. At least you have me. I will protect you. Look, I\u2019m strong, right?\u201cDear Anis\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh heh, my engagement has been dissolved already, but you were still supposed to be my sister, weren\u2019t you? Then it\u2019s okay for you to think I\u2019m your sister, right? I respect your freedom.\u201dThis kid has always been on the defensive side. Pride, family name, country. Those who were supposed to protect them gave them their hands back. Then who can complain where this child is on the side of being protected? Even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t allow it.I have to protect this girl for you. The wizard I admired, the one I expected to stand at the top of the country I recognized, this kid who could have been my sister in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll protect you. Until the day when you can choose your own way of life again. That\u2019s why there\u2019s magic. Because magic is my dream, my dream, to make it happen.\u201dPlease learn. There\u2019s no one way to grasp happiness. You can find it yourself. That\u2019s any form of happiness, so I can walk out for my happiness again.Let\u2019s protect this kid. It seemed natural. Because if I can protect it, it will lead me to protect a dream that never came true. A wizard who can be recognized by everyone, a nice wizard who can make everyone smile.\u201cBecause I promised. He said it would make you happy.\u201dSo be protected. Until the day comes when I will get out of this hand. And so that one day I can walk with you even when that day comes.I want to see this child\u2019s future. That\u2019s all I need to know is why I protect you. I put a little effort into my arms holding Yufi tight.Yufi didn\u2019t say anything. Without saying anything, they just wrapped their hands around my back and hugged each other. If you notice, until Uffi goes to sleep. That\u2019s how we kept hugging each other.\u201cSilly -\u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant leap.\u201c- Something ahhhhhhhh!!\u201dAnd a drop kick that incorporates rotation until beautiful.Beautifully tapped into my face, my real father\u2019s kick was too much for me to dance the universe, and I was tapped to the floor with a light spin.Yeah, I forgot. I kept it to myself that I went on a dragon hunt. If you bring up Airdra, your father will find out!?My father, who visited me to tell me a novel when I returned, looked at Airdra, who was loaded in the carriage, and smiled with a full face, \u201cExplain! It was the beginning of this tragedy that I came to say.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing!!\u201d\u201cTo whisper what\u2019s finished is to be done by the cautious, Father! Please do not work for my daughter, who has served with generosity!\u201cEven if you have a heart as wide as the sky, the wind you have caused will make you stand up\u2026! There is no mercy for you when it comes to the sun\u2026!Oh, this is disgusting. It\u2019s a long time ago in Maggie mode. Finally, my father putzed me. No, but I\u2019m not the only one, am I?!? I\u2019m not the only one who caused problems and overloaded the stress!? Even Al is!?\u201cHunting a dragon by yourself, etc., and which aga story dragon slayer!\u201cBecause I wanted it!\u201cAt least! Say something! Say it!\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019ll take it away!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cOf course, then!? How much do you think the dragons are worth! You used it luxuriously for personal, hobby, magic items like this!?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention Airdra like this, etc! Your father would want to be windy too!? It would be awesome!\u201cMm-hmm. That\u2019s a good suggestion. At least we don\u2019t have a choice to dismantle.\u201dAll right, Airdra, disassembly avoided successfully! Oh, my God, if Father honestly wanted to ride, I\u2019d nod softly, too. No!\u201cExcept for reprimanding my daughter for acting unsolicited.\u201d\u201cHiccup?\u201cThe rest only behaved as kings, and I remembered that I rarely dealt with you as a father.\u201dNo, no, because, Father, it\u2019s hard in the kings business\u2026? Well, I suppose you deserve less time as a father, don\u2019t you? Wouldn\u2019t that rather be directed at Al\u2026? Look, I, because I have a mad consciousness!He grabs the root, and for some reason he is put on his lap, where his father sat in a chair, lying down. At that moment I could see an alarm ringing in my brain. He restrains his father so that he can pinch his knees and arms where he tried to ramble.\u201cSpeaking of kids\u2019 classics, that was a butt slap, right? Anis.\u201d\u201cHih!? Hey, hey, uh!? Are you insane, Father! Thinking about my age!? Are you sure the King is willing to inflict such mental torture?!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still me as my father who\u2019s here now, no, it\u2019s me. Are you ready for this? Wouldn\u2019t you like to strike this overflowing passion with your sermon\u2026\u2026!\u201cMy voice is serious\u2026! Uffi! Uffi! Help! Stop Ilaria, too!Yufi, who saw this situation as gratuitous, has the face, however, of what to do because he is his father.Take a step forward so that Ilia, who had refrained next to it, would shelter Uffi, and offer her a respectful greeting.\u201cYour Majesty, I will finish later. Please, keep your heart open!! Do everything you can to get things done!!\u201d\u201cBecome!? y, Ilia\u2026\u2026 ugh!? I betrayed you\u2026! Take me! You betrayed me!!\u201d\u201cPrincess, is it right to say this in style? Says\u201d zama \u201d!Ma, Ilia said it out with a full smile!? It\u2019s a terrible betrayal, you think this kind of cruel torture is good to be allowed, there are only demons here\u2026!When I was scratching the algae trying to escape, a good sound was played from me. Moments, I turn away from the pain of running through. Ouch, Ouch!? Sounds to the core!?\u201cOh, that sounds good.\u201d\u201cHino!? Oh no! You\u2019re such a torturer to slap me in the butt! Father\u2019s pervert! Pervert!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was anything besides heterosexuality that you would refuse to do that. This is good! Reflect deeply! No, no, no! Shh!\u201d\u201cHigi, higi!? The shock is coming all at once, what kind of beating are you doing!?\u201dOuch. Ouch, broken bones! The shock\u2019s wrapped up and we can smash it from the inside! And my sooo ass hurts!?\u201cWhat, this is a magical application, too. Bundle the shock at once and strike it out of your palm.\u201d\u201cDoes anyone bother to use magic to slap your ass!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here. And I am deeply aware that it was myself who invited this, but it is good, Anise\u2026! It\u2019s a pleasure!My voice is laughing! I\u2019m definitely enjoying this father! What a bad taste!\u201cOh, I can\u2019t go to your daughter-in-law!!\u201d\u201cDid you think such an excuse would make sense now!! Carve it deep into yourself here for what you have never been able to scold!!\u201d\u201cHigi no!? Go! Ouch! Ouch! It hurts, Father! I didn\u2019t mean to throw away being a maiden!?\u201d\u201cMaiden\u2019s going hunting dragons by herself. Ahhhh!\u201cGahhhhhh!? My butt shouldn\u2019t be an instrument uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201dI forgot my maiden\u2019s shame for so much pain that I got zero wild screams. Still, I was not released and my freedom was only allowed to scream in pain\u2026\u2026How much time would have passed. I finally sat in a chair and was beaten to the point where I rather didn\u2019t want to sit. My legs trembled like a deer, so I could only stand on my knees and cling to the elbow of my chair.My father is sitting satisfied in front of me like that, and Yufi is sending his gaze at me worried. Ilia worked as usual. I can\u2019t forgive you\u2026 this grudge, can you stay without clearing up\u2026!\u201cMm-hmm. It\u2019s good to punish ass slapping every time you do something in the future. The rest of the depression clears up.\u201d\u201cTerrible! Not really! What were you going to do when I woke up with this special sexuality!\u201cI refused to marry or take my son-in-law, and I have nothing to worry about!\u201cDamn, I was uttered with a full smile\u2026!!\u201dYou don\u2019t make them, so you don\u2019t mind, do you? I was seen with such cold eyes. I have no choice but to shut up because I have no choice but to deny it. I was gripped by an unpleasant weakness\u2026I can\u2019t believe I have to look at your father\u2019s complexion in the future to protect my pretty ass\u2026!\u201cI mean, why are you still sitting there? Why don\u2019t you come home soon?\u201cYou, if you weren\u2019t my father, you\u2019d be disrespected, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201cI want to lie down early today because my butt hurts. Because of some kingdom of perverts.\u201d\u201cWell, don\u2019t you think you were hurt enough?\u201cPlease take your time, dear father!Seriously, now this guy\u2019s eyes were serious! You must be turning bright red. Still trying to blame your ass. It\u2019s an outside road! Livestock! We just have to let everyone know the truth about the king that will be revealed now!\u201cWell, bullshit is good. Sit down, Anis.\u201d\u201cContinuing torture?!?\u201d\u201cFine. It\u2019s gonna be a long story.\u201d\u201cEven though sitting in front of a long story was so painfully slapping my ass!? Woven torture!?\u201d\u201cI would not have done this if I didn\u2019t know you were hunting dragons, etc., I would have told that story more than I did!!\u201dI deserved it. Kuh\u2026 what I get was huge, but also what I lose was huge again\u2026! Mainly in the sense of my ass dignity\u2026\u2026!But there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t sit because he told me to. Trying not to irritate my butt so much, Ilia grabbed my shoulder and forced me to land. I thought the impact of the landing would cause my consciousness to fly unexpectedly.\u201cHih, ahh\u2026!? Oh, ahh\u2026!?!\u201cPrincess, I beg your pardon for the tea\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, remember\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely retaliate later\u2026!Later, I\u2019ll definitely make you cry\u2026\u2026! I can\u2019t help clearing up this grudge\u2026\u2026! Though he clenches his teeth unintentionally, he adjusts his posture and turns back to his father so that he is not too burdensome.\u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s the story?\u201cUh-huh. I need to talk to you guys about Algard.\u201dI wasn\u2019t talking about my ass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12: 12\u201cDid Al finish talking to you?\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026\u201dThe father\u2019s voice in reply is sinister. It\u2019s too easy to assume that it ended up being a less good result. So Al, did you go crazy for sex\u2026?Yuffi, who sits next to him, is also frowning at me in a faint way somewhere. With that look on his face, he turns his gaze to Father and asks.\u201cDear Algard, how did you get this case?\u201cAlgardo asked about the situation\u2026 Algardo first said that there was testimony that the harassment of Baroness Cyan was an attempt by the surrounding warrants to discredit Baroness Cyan at the will of Uphilia\u201d\u201cAm I? Such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cMm-hmm. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the rest either. We need to look into it more closely, but I\u2019m wondering if it might be possible to broaden the interpretation of the attention given to Baroness Cyan from Ufilia.\u201d\u201cWhat about the young ladies who committed the crime?\u201cThere is no way to identify who carried out which harassment. No one or he, did Baroness Cyan overtake it? They say things like that. There\u2019s a lot of harassment, and I don\u2019t know any time soon.\u201dWho actually did it, and the name hasn\u2019t come up? So, they say it was Uphilia who gave the instructions. I just find the phrase \u201cI\u2019m getting it\u201d nasty.Yufi didn\u2019t say it in person. But it looked like Uffi wanted me to. Maybe that\u2019s why you say \u201cI got it\u201d. Though I find it nasty. Not a good impression.\u201cIs that what actually happened? Well, the damage that Baroness Cyan suffered.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm. They also confirmed the actual items that were damaged and the evidence of the plot. I didn\u2019t see it in person. Some witnesses in the scene where Baroness Cyan was harmed, but honestly I don\u2019t know about credibility. The college today is very concerned and so confused that we have to figure out what is true. I don\u2019t know which testimony is correct.\u201d\u201cIf I get my hands on the college side from time to time, but too much interference with the college can cause burns\u2026\u201dThe College of Aristocrats is a closed social place. The habit is heavily influenced by public opinion. Even though interference is difficult, this one will soon be affected.I feel that the teaching of learning equally regardless of identity that should not cause rubbing is a bad influence. Learning equally but the difference in identity is absolute. It may not be a mistake if they say that it is the college that can be remembered.Was it because Yufi was neglected in the privileged position of Algardo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e? Or didn\u2019t you like Uffi personally? Or simply tried to plunge Uffi into the house of the Duke of Magenta?It could be all of them, which is very troublesome. I don\u2019t think everyone is moving with unified thoughts. That\u2019s why everyone shuts their mouth for the inconvenient. I don\u2019t know which is the truth anymore. Um, it\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201cThis won\u2019t even get you into class. Originally, I would like to give a full explanation of the cancellation of classes, but I also hold international students. Oh, and I can\u2019t stop the class\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here to learn, and you\u2019re going to involve international students in your country\u2019s problems? If you say so, you won\u2019t see me.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Algard, you\u2019re just messing around here\u2026\u201dIf this is all you need to do with your country\u2019s problems, it\u2019s still good. However, the College of Aristocrats also accepts students from other countries. The disturbance also began with the royal declaration of breach of engagement, such as the student\u2019s inability to take classes. It\u2019s definitely an excuse to be put in.This is a really headache problem to think about. Al, I don\u2019t want to think you\u2019re crazy until you don\u2019t know this, but what the hell happened\u2026?\u201cSpeaking of which, I heard that there are other sons of Al Kun who sheltered Baroness Cyan, but who are you?\u201c\u2026 not a pleasant story, eh?\u201c\u2026 so much?\u201cSon of the Knights Commander, son of the Secretary of the Ministry of Magic, son of one of the leading merchants in the country\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it, the on-parade that makes that stomach ache? Are you insane?\u201cI still think so\u201dThe Knights Commander and I also know each other there. Honestly, I\u2019m close enough to bash my back that I\u2019m a brave princess if I don\u2019t do what\u2019s past even the princess of the changer. Although I have never seen your son face to face very well.There must be no contact with the other kids. I\u2019m probably not familiar with merchants because they rarely meet each other directly\u2026. Secretary of the Ministry of Magic? Those are my enemies, so I don\u2019t care what happens to my son because he smiles and nicks on the surface but looks down on each other. Keh.\u201c\u2026 no, no, why are your sons so focused on such power!? It\u2019s obviously weird isn\u2019t it?!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I can leave you alone. But I don\u2019t have enough hands to figure it out.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to Baroness Cyan in that matter?\u201cHe says he\u2019s voluntarily stuck in his room now. He\u2019s been sick since that party, and he hasn\u2019t shown his face.\u201dWell, it hasn\u2019t been that long, so if you say you\u2019re ill, I don\u2019t have a choice. I don\u2019t mind, but you can\u2019t care about that, can you? This problem is on boulders.Every house is as important to the country as the Duke of Magenta, or to give way and take a step back. Even though it has been regarded as promising in the future, there may be an influence on each faction when such a result is achieved.It just hasn\u2019t spread under the water yet, and some would care about nature and what happened in the college if Yufi were known to have come to me. Either way, this will be known.\u201c\u2026 what do you think of Father?\u201cEven if this is just a erotic shack, I\u2019m going to graduate, but I guess I can tell you that too. You got something.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?Yufi speaks anxiously. Besides, my father and I look at each other and sigh small.\u201cTo be very straightforward, that Baroness Cyan is a spy for the purpose of the country\u2019s collapse or something.\u201d\u201cIt is possible that we are literally targeting the Queen. of suppressing the country\u2019s next major figure and manipulating politics behind it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that on the boulder\u2026 I\u2019m curious to know what kind of education you had at Baron Cyan\u2019s.\u201d\u201cIn the near future, Baron Cyan will have to talk to me directly. Anyway, if there\u2019s something behind it, both Anis and I are staring.\u201dAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019d rather you had thoughts. If you really seduced the sons of the leading noblemen without thought or thought, it would be something similar to the beauty of the Dungeons. If I were the queen, I\u2019d knock him out or assassinate him right away.Well, even if you think about the warmth you can, the breeding is the mountain of Sekiyama. Even that candidate has to be carefully selected, and he has to be monitored. Given the cost there, it would definitely be better if you died.Well, I mean, there\u2019s only one thing I want to say to Yufi.\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that this wasn\u2019t about Yufi being underpowered or that dimension. For example, if Baron Sian\u2019s warrant was running on someone\u2019s spy, I honestly don\u2019t think I can handle Uffi, a child I was still learning at the College of Aristocrats. It\u2019s a place to learn the basics, not a place to practice applying and dealing with things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an adult job from here on out. Because it\u2019s up to the parents to take responsibility for the child\u2019s untimely behavior. So, Anis, your restoration of the right to inherit the throne is going to take place in the near future, and we\u2019re going to have a feast for the public. I also know you don\u2019t want to be on the table, but just consolidate your readiness to be in an unwanted but unwanted situation.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s unavoidable. Worst case scenario, if you could get eaten up to the center, I think it would be nice to wedge you right away, Father.\u201dSo far, only Algard has the potential to be king. That\u2019s why I wanted power to concentrate on Algard, but I have to stand here more than that.No matter how much Algard takes precedence, we have to show the surroundings that if degrees pass, there will be a replacement. As a result, there is no choice but to crush Algard. Looks like that\u2019s all she\u2019s done.It depresses me. The sign of royalty is always cold. I don\u2019t want to get used to the feeling of my heart freezing.\u201cI\u2019m so glad someone testified that things are going to work out.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dThere was sadness in his sighing father like he was tired. Being a really hard worker.Well, after that, my father put me on a step, and I\u2019m not interested in the throne with my usual research threesome, I was wondering if I should make an appeal.I forgot, there\u2019s a party, which means there\u2019s a dance! He said he had manners! And I didn\u2019t even make my debut in the social world, and I want you to throw away dancing and manners lessons one day!The realization of such a natural fact begins with the fact that the arrival was delivered to Ilia, so that we may prepare ourselves accordingly because there will be a feast from Father shortly. That Ilia told me with a full smile.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time until the feast, so we will shred the time for research and conduct a manners and dance review\u201d\u201cEh.\u201d\u201cIt should be noted that the right of veto is not recognised by the royal fate. Absolutely.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s compulsion!? Tyranny, tyranny! I claim my right to freedom!\u201cPlease give up. Let\u2019s start with measurements to make a new dress.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no!I don\u2019t want to make a new dress! You don\u2019t want to make it! Good, \u2019cause you can wear your old dress around! Your shape hasn\u2019t changed that much!\u201cIt\u2019s a restoration of the right to inherit the throne, so if you don\u2019t dress accordingly, we\u2019ll have trouble.\u201d\u201cYou just want to say that and make a dress! I know, you know!\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make them wear it if it\u2019s not even an opportunity like this. Usually, you\u2019re all mine to me, so sometimes you can fulfill my own self? Princess.\u201dUgh. You\u2019re weak when they say that! I\u2019m not always saying all I can without any blame for my conscience! I\u2019m generally ignoring it, and I\u2019m only feeling some pain to the point of smashing my pinky finger!But when you defy it, that hurts my heart. Ugh\u2026 only this time, only this time, I can get acquainted with Al when he takes the throne. Let\u2019s also think about leaving the worst country. When your father is no longer your boss, Al will be your boss, and you\u2019re not sure you can do it well!In the end, whilst I complained of bumps, I did not go against Ilaria. Although I was told that rusty manners were at a minimum, they were only minimal, so I received strict instruction from Ilaria to refine them. I want to go home.I was asked if there was any hope for the fabric or design of the dress, but I said I was not interested in wearing it. Then he shook his neck to the left and right with all his might when he suggested a girl hobby dress with frills served as if this were still the case in the tentative proposal.\u201cMake it a calm design that will give you peace of mind, if you can, to the qualities, but to the extent that you are not ashamed to be royal, and not flashy!Even they say childish faces, so I definitely don\u2019t like outfits that can be seen younger than my age!And the most tiring part is practicing dance. I\u2019m the one who did everything, but only dancing is fatally bad. The princess doesn\u2019t like the crowd either, not to the extent that Ilia has been telling me for a long time!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want to dance\u201dManners are still good. But I don\u2019t like dancing. I don\u2019t like to imagine that there\u2019s someone there. I hate to think I have to touch them. I hate having to smile from close range.\u2018Cause the other guy is a man! I don\u2019t even want to make you aware of it, but I get goosebumps just imagining me approaching close range, holding hands and staring at each other! Oh, I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t like it! I don\u2019t want to attract your attention!\u201cDo you dislike it so much\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it!Oh, my God, it\u2019s Yufi who\u2019s dealing with me on the male part in my dance lessons. Uffi was an excellent courtesy and dancer. If Ilia asked me to teach her to dance, she\u2019d take it with pleasure.Uffi\u2019s instruction is gentle compared to Ilia\u2019s. But I\u2019m not talking about the dimensions of being kind enough to teach anymore. Me! Of men! For! This reality that we are sharpening this technology! I can\u2019t stand it!\u201cWhy do you hate your lords so much\u2026?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll talk to you someday, someday\u201dHonestly, I\u2019m not sure myself because I have a big physiological feeling either. If it had anything to do with it, I think it might have been my \u201cprevious life\u201d influence before I became an \u201canisphere\u201d.I admired magic. There was something I wanted to accomplish if I could use magic. A highly developed civilized society, ordinary people who were spending time without the rank of identity. I can\u2019t recall the personality that seems to me, even though values and such things come to mind from the common sense of the country \u201cJapan\u201d.Was it also an experience of hating men furiously in that unrememorable memory? I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking, but that\u2019s a little resentful when it comes to situations where I can\u2019t escape.Well, the strongest reason I can\u2019t physiologically, but there\u2019s also a reason why men who deal with me don\u2019t like me because they look down on me!Do it, something that would also be a princess comes out on the battlefield, etc.Do it, try to get magic into a habit that can\u2019t even use magic, etc., etc.Do it, if you were more feminine, you\u2019d want to protect me, or something.It\u2019s really annoying just remembering. I\u2019m laughing at Nico, too, if I can do research just to be protected. It\u2019s not my fault you can\u2019t use magic.\u201cDear Anis, I\u2019m frowning.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t respond carelessly\u2026. Ha, let\u2019s take a break\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dAfter all the careless replies, Yufi pissed me off. \u2018Cause you don\u2019t have a choice. I don\u2019t like bad things.I don\u2019t want to get married. If you still have the touch to shake hands or something, it\u2019s good. But look at me as a woman, and I don\u2019t like being asked to be a woman. I\u2019m going to be disgusted just because I felt that gaze. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t get this far myself, but there\u2019s no deep reason.Because I just don\u2019t like it. Then it\u2019s disgust to the physiological level already. I think of myself as a creature that\u2019s not fatally suited to women.\u201cI wish I\u2019d been born a man.\u201d\u201cDo you want to be a man?\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it. I was wondering if I would have felt different if I was still a man.\u201dIt\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t do you any good. It won\u2019t come true anyway, and I don\u2019t want to tell you I can.\u201cIf Lord Anis was your lord, could he have been engaged to me?Yufi teases me with a couscous and a laugh\u2026. Maybe that\u2019s not a bad idea. But I still don\u2019t even think it\u2019s good. Our relationship begins with Al-Kun\u2019s bluff.Yufi\u2019s change is another thing. Before the change, could Uffi and I do well to try to be the norm as queens? Think and see, about a second to the conclusion. I don\u2019t think so.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t think we got along any better than Al. The only thing that\u2019s working now is\u201d now \u201dmeshing with us. What if it doesn\u2019t make it in the first place? Though you can dream.\u201d\u201cSounds like Mr. Anise.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dBe yourself, I\u2019m not sure if they say so. Especially since I started to think about it in pieces. Well, I don\u2019t like being insulted so much by others! Especially when it comes to magic!I wonder if I have to do my best to keep my majesty as a royal. Although I\u2019m sick of it. Better than getting a weird temptation. I wouldn\u2019t if I couldn\u2019t stand it! I\u2019m not that warm.\u201cShall we continue the lesson then?\u201d\u201cOh, boy. So, hand in, lady?\u201cIf that\u2019s what you mean, it\u2019s mine.\u201dI\u2019ll stand up and give you my hand, rather than Yuffi standing first. Then Yufi laughed strangely and lay her own hand on the hand she offered.Practice as Yufi points out the unfamiliar dance as it is. The rusty manners were reformulated by Ilia, and Yufi was able to pass the dance, one day.Our father sent us an invitation to attend the feast. It was an announcement that a party day had been set to announce the restoration of my right to inherit the throne.\u201cHa\u2026 you finally decided, melancholy\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve taught so many lessons without making a sound, princess.\u201d\u201cI was giving it to you! I don\u2019t want to do this anymore! But you didn\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s what I do\u201dI was truncated unharmed by Ilia at my usual rate. After all, I regret, I can tell you that the days that were just what Ilia wanted were days of humiliation for me! I can\u2019t forgive you!\u201cHa, I hope this is the only time\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do that. I think I\u2019ll be called in again sometime.\u201d\u201cThe world is irrational -!I didn\u2019t want to welcome you very much. I could only fall in so that I could get to my desk with momentum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: 13A night when the moon shines in dazzle. Palettia Royal Castle, in the corner for its feast, the dressed people were interested in conversation with a gentle grin.Today\u2019s feast was led by the king himself, and an invitation had been sent because there was a serious announcement. The faces of the participants were also full of leading nobles in important positions in the country.\u201cI have a serious announcement today\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it about that rumor?\u201cDisengagement between Prince Algard and the Duke of Uphilia\u2026\u201d\u201cSo today you think it will be officially told by His Majesty?\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s gonna throw a big banquet so far\u2026\u201dEveryone tries to gather information with a passion for conversation until the time of the feast. To grasp the king\u2019s intentions at this feast.A small twist occurs in such a venue. Because the person who came into the venue blinded me.It\u2019s Ufiria. She has been escorted to the venue by her father, Grants. So much so that I think it was just a rumor, such as breaking an engagement, that it takes people\u2019s eyes away.\u201cIs Miss Uphilia in attendance too?\u201d\u201cBut Master Algard isn\u2019t here, is he?\u201cSo, that rumor is still\u2026\u201dThose who speak of their speculation. Uphilia doesn\u2019t talk to anyone and moves around escorted by Grants. Everyone was watching as they followed it with their eyes.The bell rang to draw attention in that. A gaze gathers to the bell-ringing butler, who gives a brilliant bow of grace before raising his face.His Majesty the King, and Her Royal Highness the Princess of Anisphere.The door opens slowly. Orphans, the king, slowly walks out, and from behind him the anisphere appears.Anyone who knows Anisphere from time to time would have been surprised. The expression is tightened naturally, sparingly exposing the beauty it originally possessed.Hair is glossy, healthy skin is polished out and even toned. The dress that you wear is also a soothing outfit, but it is not unlikely that you will ever bury it around you.Peacefully blooming high ridge flowers. Everyone who knows the Anisphere exhales with admiration and is blinded. Anisphere, whose eyes were slightly thin open with her gaze and slight twist, smiles gently.Orphans and Anisphere stand as they are guided to the high seats. Those who took part in the feast, Orphans, in a position to look down on everything, opened his mouth strictly.\u201cMy dear ministers gathered at this feast. On this good day, there are many surprises to share with you. Listen to me now.\u201dShin, the place calms down. Announcement from the King, concentrate your nerves to say you won\u2019t divulge its contents.\u201cSome of you have already heard, but it was the other day. It\u2019s a feast to celebrate the graduation of students at the Academy of Nobility.\u201dI thought you were here. Everyone in the venue made themselves slightly harder. After all, what Orphans is trying to tell everyone is about an example of an engagement breakdown riot.\u201cThe feast to be celebrated has had an unwanted upside, though. My son, Algard, declared his engagement broken to his fianc\u00e9e, Ufiria. The sudden surprise and anxiety caused all of us is all we royalty think about.\u201dThough Orphans did not bow his head, he was aware that there was something slightly bitter on his tight expression. The truth is, I guess the more I want to bow my head, the more I\u2019m looking for remorse.But the pain is also an instant thing. I could no longer see such a color on my immediately retightened look.\u201cHowever, I confess that there has been a breakdown of the engagement more than before. But make it clear that it is a vulgar rumor but does not originate in the misconduct between Algard and Uphilia. As for the breaking of Uphilia\u2019s engagement\u2026\u2026 my daughter, Anisphere. Explain it.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me for speaking.\u201d\u201cUhm, forgive\u201dEncouraged by Orphans, Anisphere, who was pulling back one step, gives a gratuity and asks permission to speak. If Orphans tells permission, Anisphere stands side by side with Orphans and looks out to everyone in the venue.\u201cGood mood, ladies and gentlemen. My dear sire has entrusted me with the task of explaining it. It is Anisphere. After a strong request from me to discuss this divorce, it began with Algardo.\u201dOnce again, the field goes out of its way. Why that anisphere? and. I don\u2019t even show my face to the social world, and my duties as a royalty are barely exchanged. Occasionally, it was an assessment of a strange man popping up to crusade demons to ruin the heavens or making strange inventions.I wonder why she talked about the engagement between Uphilia and Algard. Many people think unnaturally. An astonishing gaze therefore concentrates on the anisphere.\u201cAs you all know, I\u2019m working on a new technology called magic. In the process I was blessed with an opportunity to deepen my understanding of magic, coincidentally, with Uphilia, who excelled in the handling of magic. With that in mind, I\u2019ve come to express my hope that Uphilia and I might be able to work together.\u201dSoon a gaze will come and go between Anisphere and Anisphere to the high seat where Anisphere and Orphanth will stand, to Uphilia, who was standing in the lower seat just beside it.\u201cBut as some of you may know, my brother, Algard and I were at a distance. I relinquished my right to inherit the throne, and that was all a consideration to push Algard as king, so as not to create any extra grudge. So I was negotiating over people\u2026\u201d\u201cAlgard misunderstood in the process and his relationship with Uphilia became unexpected. I want everyone to know that it was the backdrop of this incident because of the overlap of factors there. I can\u2019t do anything more than say it once. This was their hope, and future decisions were made. I want to declare it from the rest of my mouth again.\u201dOrphans take the lead again to replace Anisphere.\u201cOne, I officially declare through this occasion the breaking of Algardo\u2019s engagement with Uphilia\u201dOoh, and a twist spreads from the nobles of the venue. Engagement broken declared by the king, his eyes hidden so that Uphilia, who had received it, lay down her eyes.\u201cTwo, at the request of Anisphere, Uphilia will officially be asked about assistants as research assistants in magic. It will be treated as a departure from the college. I want you to think that only books will be treated as school attendance, but graduation is fixed, and graduation is quick.\u201dUphilia is involved in magic. That was, in a way, a huge shock.The magic studied by Anisphere is not surprising, but basically its methods and research content will not be published. Royalty, no, I could say that Anisphere is in a state of monopoly.Uphilia, one of the leading nobles in the kingdom and a man of high qualities, was officially appointed assistant. Those who try to read the meaning of it in depth never cease to follow.\u201cAnd three, let\u2019s just say this is the real deal. Beginning on this date, the restoration of the right of succession to the throne of Anisphere Wynn Palettia is hereby declared. In the future, Anisphere will have the right to the second throne.\u201dThe stirring of the venue expands to a greater extent than ever before. Everyone had a surprise look at the restoration of the right to inherit the throne, the declaration that the path to the throne had been paved again in Anisphere, which had once renounced its right to inherit in its infancy.\u201cUphilia, come here\u201d\u201cExcuse me, Your Majesty.\u201dCourtesy, Orphans urges Uphilia to take her seat. Take the hand offered by Orphans after a grace and line up next to Orphans.\u201cThe breakdown of Algard\u2019s engagement has unfortunately flown. However, in inviting Uphilia, who had contributed greatly to the cause of the country, it was decided that the restoration of Anispheric succession to the throne was desirable. It doesn\u2019t change that first place is Algard, but from now on, I want everyone to look back on Anisphere\u2019s responsibilities as a royal family and watch her behave as she deserves. This is a complement to the Duke of Magenta family involved in the royal convenience, while at the same time demonstrating our attitude to continue to use the Duke of Magenta family as our dear minister\u201dI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019m going to see it. The twist widens. Orphans raise one hand to control the noisy scene.\u201cI will greet you from the rest with these three declarations. The feast will be the restoration of the right to inherit the throne of Anisphere and the hope of the future prosperity of the Kingdom of Palletia. Enjoy yourselves!The performance began with Father\u2019s proclamation, and the feast began in earnest.If the feast begins, the nobles will come to greet you in turn. I was being chased for customer service to such aristocrats. I laugh at Nico like I pasted a smile mask, and flush her home unmistakably.There were those who tried to sneak up on you, those who appeared obviously suspicious while hiding the colours, those who called out suspiciously about what the hell they had done, and those who were not going to hide their hostility about what they were going to do.I feel the harsh gauge in me builds up momentum. Ha, so he said he\u2019d avoided the social world and stuff before. I\u2019ll give it back with interest that I don\u2019t need anything to eat or dislike. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, so I want to put them all together and put them in line for bowling pins\u2026\u2026!\u201cDear Anis, your expression is getting worse.\u201dI am embarrassed with a whisper by Uffi, who stood next to me. I put a smile mask back on Yuffi\u2019s point and smile with Nico.Uffi has been beside me since the feast began. Those who speak to Uffi like that vary. Mostly, I\u2019m sorry about the engagement, but congratulations on the glory, and all that stuff. Hmm, I wonder if you really think from the bottom of your heart that it\u2019s glory.When it comes to divestiture, there was also a request from me. I don\u2019t hear any disgust that my eyes would be drawn to by the fact that I turned my back on the story. Well, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m beside you.(In that sense, I want to stay away from Ufi\u2026)Then the song that was playing changes. It was at the same time a signal to change from a place of discourse to a place of dance. I get a depressing sigh by accident. Finally, it\u2019s time for a dance\u2026Well, I don\u2019t have anyone to invite. I don\u2019t want anyone to come and invite me if I can, but I want you to stay the way you are on the wall\u2026\u201cPrincess Anisphere, could you dance with me for one song?Whoa, I\u2019m here\u2026 Well, maybe fate is more Ufi than I am. Don\u2019t invite me first on this occasion. It\u2019s not a good idea to invite Yufi, so I guess you mean me first.Well, I wonder who Sacrifice said to invite me to the dance. Stick a smile on it, look back and see the other person\u2019s face.\u201cYes, joy,\u2026 with\u201dUnexpectedly my words stall on my butt blush. I was grinning and my mouth was going to cramp.Silver hair with blue, long body, but I don\u2019t get the impression that it\u2019s unhealthy. Ice blue eyes stare at me zippily, and if you just say it by its appearance, it\u2019s a beautiful man\u2019s princess. The surrounding maid won\u2019t stop, I think.I know this guy very well. My skin developed goosebumps all at once. Why would the \u201chead elite of the Ministry of Magic\u201d invite me to dance!\u201cOh, Earl of Voltaire son. Thank you for inviting me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind Lang, princess\u201d\u201c\u2026 then with Lord Lang\u201dYou clumsy foe! and cursing inside I try to keep my smile.Lang Voltaire. An elite nobleman of wizards working for the Ministry of Magic. The next head of the Voltaire family, a family that excels in magic and continues to produce outstanding wizards. And the same age as me. Though we don\u2019t need that in common.Only a house that produces an elite of wizards, respects those who can handle magic and looks down on those who can\u2019t use it. It\u2019s like an elite painting like that. And he\u2019s also one of those who handled my magic all over the place. I forgive you\u2026 no matter how many years have passed, you are the only one I forgive\u2026!\u201cOkay, one song\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201dHow dare you? If you asked me out, I\u2019d have to dance.Thought I\u2019d step on it as much as I wanted, but that\u2019s sorry to Yufi for teaching me how to dance. Paste a smile but deflect your consciousness from the feel of your hands being focused and in touch with the dance. I still don\u2019t like it even over gloves.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect you to regain your right to inherit the throne.\u201dLang tells me in a voice that only reaches me. Besides, I smile but send a cold gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s only second place, it\u2019s a spare. You won\u2019t be on the throne.\u201d\u201cHow serious are you? We have heard about Prince Algard. I see, I have no idea what His Majesty thinks.\u201d\u201cYes, everything as His Majesty wills.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it a little too much to surround Miss Uphilia?\u2026 Ah yes, that\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Yufi, isn\u2019t it? Well, I knew.\u201cIf my engagement to Prince Algard was broken, would I have a chance?\u201d\u201cI guess that depends on Yuffi\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cYeah, unfortunately, I\u2019d really like you to take this opportunity to broaden your horizons. Her talents are too sparing to rot.\u201d\u201cYeah, so it depends on what you asked me to do under me.\u201d\u201cMagic, is it\u201d\u2026 Hey, I know you tried to laugh with your nose, you rotten handsome.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I don\u2019t like magic modoki that much. I really shouldn\u2019t stick around for a long time.\u201cHer talent is a miracle. Please don\u2019t let it rot. No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m telling you right now. He\u2019s a leader in magic.\u201d\u201cThank you for thinking about Yufi. I also look forward to her future, so I hope you will keep an eye on her.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to be close, too.\u201dWho makes Yufi come closer to a gut-rotting typical elite thought aristocrat like you!Lang hates magic a lot. Magic is a miracle given to you more than the world you deal with. He is noble because he can handle magic, and he thinks it\u2019s worth it there.So you\u2019re looking down on me as a royal but never dealing with magic. Furthermore, since the presentation of magic science, they have been made enemies of it. I\u2019ve even been told it\u2019s blasphemous technology to process demonic materials into pseudo-magic.That\u2019s why this guy and I have a relationship between water and oil. But when Uffi is involved here, the story is different. Yufi is also a brilliant wizard and is even more of a Duke\u2019s daughter. The House of the Duke of Magenta is also highly spoken.If they\u2019re going to leave a brilliant wizard behind, they\u2019ve definitely set their sights on Uffi. Although the Counts are somewhat out of tune compared to the Dukes, angrily enough, they might say that Lang\u2019s own achievements can be matched.\u2026 Well, I can\u2019t say no if Yufi tells me Lang is good. Yufi put it in my pocket once. They\u2019ll take it away from me. I\u2019m so sorry. It could be my sister, and now it\u2019s my sister\u2019s turn. I need to protect you as my sister\u2019s replacement!\u201cSo now you\u2019re me. We sincerely hope you will continue to flourish.\u201d\u201cThank you, Master Lang\u201dThough over the gloves, I run scared thinking I was dancing with this guy holding hands.Uh, I can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t go dancing next in this state. I say a word to the service and then I go out to the balcony.The outside wind is soothing and comfortable. I feel terrible at all. Well, it\u2019s still good that I can\u2019t stand up and blame the gagger anymore. It was horrible when I started presenting magic.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t even like it and couldn\u2019t use it. I would normally use it if I could.\u201dI wanted to use magic. Once you know that it exists, you can\u2019t give up dreaming.If you can\u2019t use it in the usual way, in a new way. Breaking existing concepts. But I wanted to have a miracle called magic. With magic, I can make someone smile. I can smile myself. I wanted that power so that everyone would be happy.But the reality is tough. The magic has certainly become available. But breaking down existing concepts. That was unacceptable to many. How long has it been for someone, not anymore? I made it for myself and started to wish I could do something that was going to be good for someone.That there is a minority of people in this world who understand me. Then it\u2019s good for the few. For all that, I decided to use my magic.\u201c\u2026 I wish I could have studied it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to be a king. I didn\u2019t want you to restore your right to inherit the throne. I don\u2019t want to dance or talk to them like they make fun of magic. My heart is twitching and hurting, it\u2019s getting harsh, it\u2019s getting mucky\u2026\u201cTurn them all into bowling pins after all\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, Master Anis. Did you come here?\u201d\u201cHih.\u201dMake Yufi\u2019s voice suddenly jump on his shoulder. Turn around, there was Uffi.Uffi moves to line up next to me, which was up to the back of the balcony.\u201cWere you resting here?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore with one song\u201d\u201cThat one\u2026 was the son of Count Voltaire of the Ministry of Magic, wasn\u2019t he?\u201cOh man. He hates me a long time ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes, is it\u201dThen why did you ask me out first? and. Uffi is tilting his neck. That was just trying to find out if I could rip Yuffi off from me, and I said, shut my mouth. It\u2019s nothing to say.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Uffi have to dance?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m ashamed to say that I\u2019m sorry to have planted all that dancing on Master Anis\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 touching a man is a little hard to breathe\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dYes, it was. Yufi had just been badly hit by Alkun. Though days have passed since then, it\u2019s still the most recent story. Yet dancing with men seemed more painful than I thought.I gradually notice that Yuffi\u2019s hands are shaking slightly. Seeing Yufi like that, I took Yufi\u2019s hand.\u201cLet\u2019s dance, Uffi!\u201cHuh? With Master Anis, is it?\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people here, and I didn\u2019t know who blamed me. You don\u2019t hate dancing, do you? But you\u2019re not, I knew it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you all right?\u201dLet my words squeeze my eyes, and Yufi laughs small. And you hold back the hand I took.I recognize it as consent and dance to lead Uffi. Even though it\u2019s the opposite part of what you taught me, dancing with each other meshes. That was strange, and me and Uffi laughed face-to-face.\u201cThat\u2019s funny, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a dance for two women\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be nice if you enjoyed it?\u201cIf your fathers see you, you\u2019ll be frightened.\u201d\u201cYou just have to let me get stunned! What\u2019s the value of a dance that\u2019s not even fun!Take the steps and twirl around for two. Eventually the music stops. A moment of silence, until you switch to the next song.\u201cIf Lady Annis hadn\u2019t taken me out that day. Sometimes I think so.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you cried, crushed, disliked it all\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter, it could have been broken\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI was honestly glad you said it would make me happy. Thank you for giving me a chance when everything failed, Master Anis.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cKeep it up, thank you\u201dKeep up the good work. Connected hands shake hands. Grip each other to wrap it up.My magic is the magic that makes someone smile. If everyone could smile, those little dreams would have changed shape. Young dreams grow up a little colder, narrower.The reach is narrow. I no longer dream about the length of my hand. That\u2019s why I think strongly. I won\u2019t let go of this connected hand. This is the happiness I wanted.You\u2019ll have time when the boring party is over. Let\u2019s go find out what we don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s go see something we\u2019ve never seen before.

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14: 14Anisphere Wynn Palettia is famous for being a fool.An odd freak who fails to figure out what royalty is, and leaves out the present in a strange study.But why don\u2019t you change your perspective and take a look? Specifically, what is the figure of Anisphere from the people?The impression of an odd freak doesn\u2019t make a big difference. Feel free to come down to Castle Town for royal habits and go around the store in the hiccups.What does it sell and nothing has changed? Who did what and what the case was. She listens to the public and leaves.The only time she takes the initiative is when something happens that involves her research. However, the problems I told her were invisible and were often saved at some point by policy.Is it a coincidence, or is Anisphere delivering the voice of the people to the king? But wherever you go, Anisphere is a freak and an odd man who is not royal.Still, she is loved. Being royal but listening to the voices of the people, trying to share the same gaze can feel familiar for better or worse.And most importantly, it\u2019s rare. Something she creates. I don\u2019t know where you come up with that idea. There\u2019s a strange princess who shows me that stuff one after another.Look, I\u2019m flying through the sky again today with something weird. Fear flies away when you see that princess, even though you think that if you do poorly, it will be horrible.Princess Anisphere again. Even today the people of the Kingdom of Palletia were singing peace.A roaring sound echoes into the blue sky. I\u2019m flying in the air right now on Airdra. That said, it\u2019s your father who\u2019s piloting Airdra.Though usually dressed to preserve his majesty as king, he now wears a little armor and looks like a samurai. I was clinging to my father\u2019s back like that and enjoying a pleasure flight with him.\u201cWhat do you say? Father.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! This is not good stuff!It was a sunny, bright voice to come back to the inquiry, and Father seemed to have so much fun. He was so fond of freeing himself from his daily duties and dancing in the sky.It may be too much to say that he is like a child, but he tells me that the father who is piloting Airdra is very confused.My father usually does a fine job as king, but from time to time he clears up his depression by trying my inventions himself. There are places where I expect my father to be a tester because he gives me candid opinions about the invention.Airdra seemed very fond of me this time and kept smiling all the time. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, it\u2019s your father who\u2019s relentlessly coming up with grievances.Father slowly lowers altitude and velocity as it is, landing in the garden of the outhouse. Taking advantage of the last reflection, the matter of proper landing has also cleared up the issue. That\u2019s all the features we\u2019ve included in Airdra so far. I don\u2019t think there is a problem when I say finished product.\u201cHow\u2019s Airdra?\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good. If you can mass produce this, your dreams will spread considerably.\u201d\u201cAt first the network\u2026\u2026 it would be nice to be able to use it for contact flights from Wang Du to each city and the surrounding village. When the numbers increase, it would be ideal for the Knights to travel and go in the hands of the people and use them for transportation.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 that\u2019s a good idea. Rarely can I admire letting go. But it\u2019ll take time. I don\u2019t suppose we have yet a stable, mass-produced flying magic tool?\u201cIf you just want to use it, you have a flying magic object of the shape of a magazine, but in terms of stability and safety, it\u2019s still a substitute for insecurity.\u201dI couldn\u2019t take off the image of a witch if I were to fly. You don\u2019t really think about letting others use this because it\u2019s a hobby product.I\u2019ve checked the required features, and I think the design of Airdra, which I created as a vehicle properly, could be better diverted if it was to be mass produced. The problem is the price of the material. Airdra doesn\u2019t think about using dragon materials in her hobbies or making them out of mass production. When it comes to mass production, it is necessary to look for materials that are easily mass produced and redesign them.\u201cIf it were to be mass produced, you would leave my hand. I can\u2019t make numbers if I\u2019m personal.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026. don\u2019t let this sound like a mismatch between you and the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s not like we like each other.\u201d\u201cThough I will persuade you to resent me.\u201dFather\u2019s point makes me pointy my lips. \u2018Cause I hate things I don\u2019t like, magic supremacists can be doomed. It\u2019s not like I liked it and couldn\u2019t use magic.In a way, I guess I\u2019m not magical supremacy either. Nothing. I think you should like the doctrinal assertion. I just don\u2019t like raw people looking down on it with an attitude. I get jealous of my magical talent, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna talk to you.Besides, magic props born in the course of the study of magic don\u2019t pick people to use as long as they have magic. I haven\u2019t made it stand out, but magic has those advantages over magic. In the end, things are both advantageous and flawed naturally, and it is not my preference to discuss and disparage only the flaws.So although I hate magicians, I don\u2019t even hate the way a country is made up of magical beings. It\u2019s not like magic itself is a sin.\u201cWell, it was quite a meaningful time. Then let\u2019s say we go back for the rest. Encourage me, Anis.\u201d\u201cYes, Father, please don\u2019t push me.\u201d\u201cHmm. I\u2019m telling you from the bottom of my heart, you\u2019re as good as ever.\u201dFather floated his face like he had chewed up a bitter worm. So sorry, no offense.He drops off his father, who\u2019s taking his escort away, and then he takes a breather by turning Airdra into a warehouse.\u201cGood day, Master Anis\u201d\u201cUfi.\u201dYufi spoke to me at a time when I exhaled. Time has passed since Yufi officially became my assistant so that we can read each other\u2019s breathing within living together.Yuffi basically sleeps in my outhouse and lives back home for the week off. Since I started living here, my shoulders seem to have lost a lot of strength, and I feel like I can live with my laziness and my wings stretched out every day. Most importantly.\u201cWhat do you say? Even a breath of tea.\u201d\u201cHappy to invite you, lady?\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me\u201dThey interact with each other and laugh at each other with zero distracted breath.I tried to call Ilia for tea, and at some point I was already showing up and starting to get ready. I didn\u2019t feel any sign of Ilia, but if Ilia asked me to assassinate her, I might accidentally get killed.I don\u2019t think Ilia would do that. It\u2019s going to be used to harass me before I assassinate you.\u201cMmm! Airdra showed it to your father, too, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll relax for a while. Unless it\u2019s a stampede.\u201d\u201cStampede isn\u2019t a good thing to wake up with so many times, and don\u2019t pop up because it\u2019s stampede every time, okay? Because I now have the right to inherit the throne.\u201d\u201cEh.\u201d\u201cUh, it\u2019s not. It is also my job to encourage such awareness. Forgive me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still stiff, Yufi is\u201d\u201cMaster Anis is too flexible.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dMbe, and tongue out and sip the tea. Ilia smacked me when I was licking my pepper like a dog. Yufi also had jitsu eyes. Pull your tongue in hard and drink tea normally.I get the illusion that my body or my chi is dull when I\u2019m having a relaxing time. Well, I was going to relax if I didn\u2019t even get stampede originally, which is why this is the situation I should want.\u201cHmm, although I\u2019d like to proceed with some basic research. I have Yufi in the corner.\u201d\u201cIs this basic research?\u201cMana Blade\u2019s attribute granting, that sort of thing. Though there\u2019s technology at the base, I was wondering if we could move forward in the direction of pulling the developing technology up a step.\u201d\u201cIs it attribute granting? Not just use the magic of the user?\u201cThere are attributes that can\u2019t be used by people like me or people who don\u2019t have the aptitude, and I was wondering if I could improve there. Well, maybe they don\u2019t want it in mass production when they say it\u2019s necessary or not. Sometimes I just want to try it.\u201dIt is very difficult to attribute to Mana Blade\u2019s fullness. At least with the technology at this stage, I\u2019m about to throw a spoon at the inefficiency, too. When I ask if I need to struggle that far to incorporate functionality into Mana Blade, I don\u2019t need it clearly.It is only my hobby to attribute to myself. Although I don\u2019t think this technology research will be wasted, I have left it because I didn\u2019t want any progress until now.\u201cYuffi\u2019s Arcane Shell is able to attribute itself, even though it depends on Yuffi\u2019s magic. And then I hope I can study how it works and manage to get technically depressed\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it would be nice if Anise could create a technique that would reproduce my attribution to anyone.\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Um, boulder honor student. It\u2019s so quick and helpful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help you\u201dMy heart twitches and warms to Yufi, who says with a grin. It\u2019s good to have someone who can be happy and worried about research. I have tried not to spread the influence of magic too much, but is it a luxury to feel a little unwell?For a while, Yuffi asks Arcane Shell to let his senses fall into the surgical ceremony during his mastery and body formation. I wonder what I should do in the meantime. Although Mana Blade\u2019s design itself doesn\u2019t have a part to expand anymore. I wonder if there\u2019s enough to explore how I can cost it down precisely.It\u2019s a little hard to move now to start something new, and I want to see a little more about Yufi. My life has just changed, and I don\u2019t want to do anything to distract you.\u201cYufi, how\u2019s life now?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201cTrouble or something? Look, there\u2019s something about your brother\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dI smiled as if Yufi was only a little troubled when it came to the subject of your brother. Even my brother Caindkun sometimes looks at each other more than he is back at his parents\u2019 house for the week off.Kaindo-kun was angry at the royal response to Yufi. Honestly, I brought Uffi here so I could cheat, but then I wondered what happened.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re still stuck in your belly. I\u2019m a little worried about how well you\u2019re doing in college\u2026 but you just don\u2019t talk to me much\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, then it\u2019s going to be hard for me to go out in person and face to face.\u201d\u201cIf you could just look a little closer at the time. Your father and mother care about you\u2026\u201dUm, some of the royal responses were bad, but I\u2019m really sorry to leave the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house out of trouble.Sooner or later, I\u2019d like to talk to Kaindo-kun face to face, but it seems premature. Al-kun really did a lot of trouble for me.(College, what\u2019s going on now\u2026?Though I had intentionally tried not to hear much about the college, I might not be able to say so in the future. I think we need to look more broadly into this from now on than we have regained our right to inherit the throne.Maybe it\u2019s really possible that Al won\u2019t be granted the right to inherit the throne. Maybe you should talk to someone, though I don\u2019t really care.Although I only wanted to do research, I couldn\u2019t say that anymore. I was really getting zero sigh in the reality.Now, since it would be harsh to make Yufi listen to the current state of the college investigation, I decided to act alone. I thought that Yufi should come and welcome a new lady beside me, but I haven\u2019t welcomed her in the end.I\u2019m discussing with Ilia that if she\u2019s going to work out of the palace, she wants me to be someone with no prejudice and a hard mouth. But it\u2019s not that easy to find someone that convenient right away, and they end up hanging around in the universe.So Ilia is getting about Yufi at the moment. Are those two compatible, they seem to be close, and don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s all it takes to make you feel safe.\u201cWell, and\u201dI squeal to put my temper back on. The purpose of this solo action is to gather information.But when it comes to gathering information, I am oblivious to the legend of nobility. There have been times when I have been withdrawn from politics and I have no legend. I didn\u2019t really think Al would be in trouble when I came up.For that matter, there is a lot of information that can be picked up from the civilian population by going down to Castle Town or naming Adventurers Guild. Occasionally, I have been rushing down to Castle Town to report to my father. The voice of the people is difficult to pick up directly.But the information I want this time is harsh in the castle town handouts. Then we have to rely on another Ate. And it was somewhere in the royal castle that I turned my legs to. From there, an ambitious voice echoes. A peek inside revealed the knights working in training.Yes, my athe was the Knights. There are not only civilians in the Knights, but also many nobles. The knights are often with you in demonic exorcisms, so they can be relatively close. Asking around for information is where to hit and put it on.\u201cSorry to bother you!The knights step into the training station with their defeated voices raised in training. The knights who were nearby stop training and look at me with a ghoulish look.\u201cA, Princess Anisphere!?\u201d\u201cI need to ask you something\u2026 oh, I\u2019m sorry I stopped you from doing your training, right? Do you have a knight captain?\u201cAnd please wait a moment!The still young knights who spoke rush away. I think it would have been better if I had spoken up in advance.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But if you think of it, you have to act immediately! I guess Ilaria tells me to calm down and act a little bit more.\u201cOh, thank you for waiting. The Knights Leader will see you.\u201d\u201cThanks. Good luck with your training.\u201dWaving at the knights who made the connection with the Knights Commander, I headed under the Knights Commander.If I slapped the knock a few degrees and then went inside, there was a beauty waiting for me inside that seemed mild. It gives you a mild vibe because its dark green hair and pale green eyes add to that impression.He is the Commander of the Knights of Matthew Sprout. He is the Knight Commander of the Kingsguard Knights placed in the King\u2019s Capital. I am also a respectful person.The Knights of the Sprout Knights have long been good to me, finding interest in my inventions. I\u2019ve been taught how to fight, and there are many opportunities to exchange words with the Knights Commander over and over again about chasing me around fleeing in the Royal Castle.A good man who also undertakes training when it comes to spreading Mana Blade to the samurai, even though she is married, she is still being sent a hot gaze by a woman.\u201cIn a good mood, Princess Anisphere\u201d\u201cGood mood, Master Sprout Knights\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you made a sudden visit.\u201dSays the Knights of Sprout with a bitter smile like some trouble. This still decreased the frequency, and I started putting in a word before visiting. I used to suddenly push a lot. The Sprout Knights Commander is already used to my treatment.\u201cI was hoping to take a moment. I\u2019m sorry to bother you while you\u2019re at work?\u201cDon\u2019t say it in doubtful form. It is also the role of the Kingsguard Knights to act as your counterpart. Please, come in.\u201dEnter his office as guided by the Commander of the Sprout Knights. This can always be a classic flow.Sitting in the guest seat, the head of the Sprout Knights will prepare tea for you. I fall in love with what I did in the Hall while being the Knight Commander and noble. Preparing tea for two, the Knights of Sprout took my opposite seat.\u201cSo, what can I do for you today?\u201cYes, actually, I\u2019d like to ask you if you know anything about the current Aristocratic College rumors or the status quo.\u201dCaptain Sprout Knights, who heard my words, round his eyes and then distorts his expression like he chewed up a bitter bug. I was aware it was a story I didn\u2019t really want to put in my ear for the Knights of Sprouts.Anyway, the son of the Knights of Sprout also says he\u2019s the one caught by that Cyan baroness.\u201cMy stupidity is very disrespectful in this matter\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, no. I didn\u2019t get any trouble myself. And I\u2019m going to have to call you a fool\u2019s brother, too, so please be there.\u201d\u201cForgive me, it hurts\u201dMy pity comes to the head of the Sprout Knights, who has completely dropped his shoulder. I don\u2019t know because this man has long had a strong loyalty to the royal family and I\u2019ve seen him do a shameless job as the Knights of Kingsguard.So as far as I\u2019m concerned, I feel like a neighbor\u2019s brother. I\u2019m about my uncle\u2019s age, rather than my brother\u2019s.\u201cBut it\u2019s rare for Anisphere to hear such rumors.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve restored my right to inherit the throne, and now I\u2019m taking over Yuffi.\u201d\u201cAs far as it goes\u2026. Miss Uphilia in a breath disaster?\u201cYeah, I\u2019m letting you relax and cure now. Looks like he\u2019s enjoying his studies of magic.\u201d\u201cThat was good\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Sprout Knights chief strokes down his chest, but soon his expression turns to bitter. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to help myself if I were in the position of the Knights Commander. I would have been in a position to stop it.Even if it\u2019s hard to tell a royal opponent, I hope he wasn\u2019t in the same position as Al at least. Yet the Knights chief\u2019s hard work is extrapolating because he is turning to the side of impeachment.\u201cSo I\u2019d like to ask you frankly. What do you think of this case?\u201cHow, what?\u201cHas the son of a powerful man been confused by an unknown baroness? I can\u2019t help it. Because it\u2019s oblivious to sex.\u201dIn the end it is there. It was Yufi and Al-Kun, and the sons of the powerful who surrounded them, and finally Baroness Cyan, who started the problem.I don\u2019t know much about this Baroness Cyan, so I don\u2019t really come to the pin. Honey, I\u2019d be most convinced if you told me you set up a trap.\u201cIn the first place, the Baron Cyan family is certainly a house where the incumbent, who grew up as an adventurer, was given the position of baroness and became one, right?\u201cYes, it seems to have been a decisive decision for my wife to receive the daughter of a patron aristocrat.\u201d\u201cHuh? So, what is Miss Raini like?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 apparently, it\u2019s complicated. Miss Raini doesn\u2019t seem to be a child with his current wife.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThere was an unexpected strange voice. What do you mean by that?\u201cWhen I was an adventurer, I forgot about the woman I had in mind.\u201d\u201cBaron Cyan said he wasn\u2019t tied to that person?\u201cWhat am I to learn more. Navr\u2026\u2026 because that\u2019s what my son told me\u201dNavre Sprout, huh? That kid, he didn\u2019t even seem polite and bad. As a sidekick to Al, he said he would be soft on the waist, look just like his parents and be like his father in the future, hey. Whoa, that\u2019s way off the record.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what it was like to take it away, but I can take the back?\u201cIt seems that was the mysterious woman, and for more information, so was I. We have investigated, but he is already a deceased person\u2026\u201d\u201cSo how did Baron Cyan take Miss Raini?\u201cShe saw Miss Raini, who had been kept in the orphanage, and realized that the woman was oblivious. You think it\u2019s the hang-up that\u2019s taken over? It was determined that she possessed her mother\u2019s appearance and that she looked alike.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s behind that orphanage?\u201cThere isn\u2019t. You can look at it as white. There\u2019s nothing shadowy about it.\u201dHmm. Then will the line called Honey Trap disappear too, or will it be a cleverly hidden two choices? But I find it inexplicable.\u201cWhat kind of child is Miss Raini?\u201cI have heard of diligence, seriousness, moderation and caution. Will the grades be excellent for ex-civilians? It just seemed so bad.\u201d\u201cEvil stands out, hey\u201dI know very well that even though I am not a nobleman, I could be seen as an enemy if I were to be taken by noble houses, and that would also be good grades and dear.I wanted to hear a few more figures from Yufi, but it felt like Yufi had never really been involved with Miss Raini.\u201cI don\u2019t know, the Lady Raini is a child. And how did all the children of the powerful get caught up in it? I was suspicious of the Honey Trap line.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think\u2026\u201dI guess the confusion is that so is the head of the Sprout Knights. Um, what\u2019s the matter?\u201cKnights Commander, what\u2019s your son now?\u201cFor the sake of reflection, I am making you cautious\u2026?\u201cNow let\u2019s talk in person!\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best to ask someone who knows more about what you don\u2019t know! That\u2019s why I\u2019m visiting the Sprouts today!\u201cYep\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: 15The Count Sprout family is known for its excellent martial arts lineage, which gave birth to the Kingsguard Knights of the Kingdom of Palletia.The mansions of such Count Sprout houses exist in the corner lined with castle towns, aristocratic mansions.Even so, this mansion is a villa. Many of the aristocratic mansions in the castle towns may be reserved for staying at the time of climbing, or for students attending an aristocratic college to live in.He seems cautious about Navre in such a villa in the Earl of Sprout family. I reluctantly pushed the Commander of the Sprout Knights reluctantly on my visit, and half forced myself to interrupt the villa of the Earl of Sprout family.I\u2019m not that familiar with Navre. At best I know my face and name, and to some extent I have said hello. I was close to the Knights of Sprout, but I didn\u2019t have any contact with Navru-kun.I hear he was also in a position to get tied up by Miss Raini and rebel Yufi. Well, I hope you listen well. Shall we say hello without making friendly aware that we are royal!\u201cHere is Navre\u2019s room. Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cThank you, Commander Sprout Knights\u201dI smile and thank the Knights Leader for guiding me to my room with an anxious face somewhere.Let\u2019s start with the knock on the door of the room. I get a reply from inside with a pointy voice somewhere. Make sure of that and smile with a hoot.\u201cAssault! Visit your next door house!!\u201d\u201cHey, whoa!?\u201dKick open the door as fast as you can with momentum. I don\u2019t care though the Knights captain is giggling next door! This kind of thing is about mood and nori!Navru-kun, who was in the room, sits up with his eyes groaned. It was as if a thief had broken in. Yeah, well, here\u2019s the reaction! Fine, I\u2019ll keep pushing it off!\u201cDon\u2019t move! I am Anisphere Wynn Palettia!\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLong time no see, Navre Sprout!\u201c\u2026 Huh? No, um\u2026 Huh?Navru-kun wandering his gaze like how to react. Behind me there are signs that the Knights Commander is holding his head. But I don\u2019t care!I pack the distance with Navru-kun, who is stunned as he is, and I grab him to shake his hands and shake him up and down. Navru-kun, who was to be but remained, finally recognized reality, opened his eyes and panicked.\u201cOh, Your Highness!? What, eh!?\u201d\u201cHmm, good reactions. You feel blood, Commander Knights!\u201cWhat are you doing to me!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been curious to see how you can say hello that\u2019s not royal!\u201cWhat do you want!?\u201d\u201cTrying to break the tension\u2026?\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026!Captain Sprout Knights with his head and Navre Kun. Huh, enough grabbing!\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do something about it with the younger ones. Thank you for your guide! Adue!!\u201d\u201cEh, hey.\u201dClose the door with all the momentum you\u2019ve just broken again. That\u2019s how he and I are left in Navru-kun\u2019s room.Sometimes it\u2019s hard to talk about having a real father. I was going to go as far as to get guidance from the original source.\u201cSo long time no see. Navr!\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026 we\u2019re out of time\u2026?Navre replies like he\u2019s lost his mind if the shock hasn\u2019t slipped out yet.Navru-kun\u2019s appearance is a dark green hair with pale honey-colored eyes that are very similar to that of the Knights Commander. Taller, the lines seem thin but don\u2019t feel unreliable. Beautiful knight as if painted on a picture. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d leave me alone if I were a normal girl.\u201cI came here today to ask you something. [M] I was cautious, so I forcibly broke through\u2026 but I didn\u2019t hear from you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what did Princess Anisphere tell me?Navru-kun asks if the shock is coming through, squeezing his expression. I can see you\u2019re on guard. Well, I\u2019ve never talked to you enough to get along, so I can\u2019t help it.\u201cGo straight in. I wanted to ask you why you rebuffed Ufilia Magenta.\u201d\u201c-\u201cI could see something bitter running in Navru-kun\u2019s expression. If you touch the reason why you\u2019re being cautious, I guess it\u2019s a natural reaction.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t get me wrong, but I didn\u2019t come here to blame you. Do you already know that I took Yufi as my assistant? As far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t deny that I\u2019m on Yuffi\u2019s side, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t care what I do with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you want me to trust that word?\u201cI ask the other way, but what can I trust!?\u201d\u201cDo you say so yourself?!?\u201dShe yelled at me to say that she didn\u2019t understand when I said it in a slightly reverse way. I miss it, it\u2019s a reaction that reminds me of the Sprout Knights when I was just a little younger. I saw that blood could not be disputed.\u201cI also think it\u2019s cruel to tell you to talk all of a sudden. But just so we\u2019re clear, I don\u2019t care about your convenience or anything.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand your emotions, and I think you should like them to the extent that they don\u2019t tilt the country. Except when it comes to Uffi. I got that kid. If that girl is sick, I want to solve it for her, and this case is really getting caught up. I want to be convinced, I am. You know?\u201d\u201cConvinced\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced, are you? If you\u2019re unhappy with Yufi, I can take care of it for you. Which way, for a while, Uffi won\u2019t be on the stage, and he won\u2019t be served again as Al Kun\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Marriage is hopeless, at least at the moment, and it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that her future has been picked. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?More and more bitter things spread on Navru-kun\u2019s expression in the wake of my words. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me for putting a little salt in your wound.I\u2019m angry about getting my hands on you, and I don\u2019t mean for the throne to be restored.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to understand what\u2019s inside the college from the outside. What did you guys think, what did you think, what did you want? As someone who runs the country, I think it\u2019s a headache story, but from my own personal point of view, if it\u2019s that much thought and action you take, why don\u2019t you like it to such an extent that it doesn\u2019t bother others? I think. But this one\u2019s causing trouble, so I think you deserve to hear the truth?\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom what I can tell, it just looks like you guys dropped by and fell into Uffi, and I even suspect Baroness Raini Sian is painting a picture of the conspiracy to overthrow the state there.\u201d\u201c- Raini doesn\u2019t want that!Navru-kun intensified his discourse so as to refute the speculation I had spoken of. But if he thought it was me, he distorted his face because he didn\u2019t think it tasted good on the boulder.\u201cNavr. I\u2019m supposed to be here as an Anisphere individual. Don\u2019t worry about your position as royalty. You can say whatever you want, okay? I won\u2019t use it later. If it\u2019s as bad as it sounds, I\u2019ll do it with personal sanctions.\u201d\u201cEither you want to reassure me or threaten me!?\u201d\u201cWell, calm down. Anyway, I don\u2019t have any influence in noble society no matter how noisy I am, and I don\u2019t want to do anything because I\u2019m disrespectful. I just want to hear what you really mean. And I want you to clear my suspicions about Miss Raini if you can. You\u2019re so caught up, aren\u2019t you, her?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you suspicious of Raini?\u201cAt least he thinks it\u2019s the most suspicious. \u2018Cause as far as I know, Al isn\u2019t stupid, and Navr\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t stupid. Don\u2019t you think people are the ones who make mistakes but wonder what happened to them to be stupid without even touching them?Al is mediocre but not stupid. At the very least, and the subordinates around you are excellent, can you retain them better than their talents? I think it was important to say one way or another there.That\u2019s why I think Father was expecting Al-Kun\u2019s networking at the academy, and I was hoping it would work out with Ufi. Though I call it mediocre, I never even think Al Kun was incompetent. They just appreciate it better or worse when you line up with me. It\u2019s very annoying from me.\u201cI\u2019ve only heard Uffi\u2019s side of the story, and if Uffi has a nonsense in the first place, that\u2019s good. To me, Uffi is an honest, hard-working kid. In the future, even fools who cannot return to aristocratic society will have no trouble being assistants. However, given that my right to inherit the throne has been restored due to your failure, it is possible that leaving this matter alone would annoy me extra. Then I want to keep it clear.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why was it me?\u201cThat seemed like the easiest thing to hear. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you are the one who suffers from understanding\u201d\u201cThey often say that.\u201dI don\u2019t even want you to understand. I\u2019ll whine that inside out.\u201c\u2026 why don\u2019t we just stand up and talk?\u201d\u201cOh, thank you so much.\u201d\u201cWhat if you realized you were a princess?\u201cThat consciousness disappeared with the absence.\u201dNavru-kun pulled me a chair, so I sit in a chair for the most part. Probably for visitors. Navru-kun also sat in the opposite seat after I took my seat.\u201c\u2026 to be honest, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being put on the surgery because my head hasn\u2019t moved because I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s too much clapping.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to open my chest collar and talk to you. See your tits?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t look!! What are you saying all of a sudden!? Crazy bitch!? Crazy bitch!?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want a man to touch me or see me. I don\u2019t want you to grow up!\u201cWhy are you going backwards there!? I don\u2019t know why\u2026!!\u201d\u201cWell, well. Little princess joke.\u201d\u201cIf the princess of the world hears about it, she\u2019s going mad\u2026\u201dHa, and he sighed like he was tired. I\u2019m sorry, I made fun of you for remembering the young days of the Cavaliers. I wonder if this is why the Knights of Sprout are getting cluttered up.It\u2019s nice to get a sense of distance closer! When I said that, I remembered the head of the Sprout Knights with a very sinister face, so I decided to stop you.\u201cThen the real deal. It was your will to rebuff Yufi, wasn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 yes. I heard that Raini was being treated unfairly, and I consulted him, including Algard, who had heard the same, and decided to contest him at Algard\u2019s suggestion.\u201d\u201cAl, you have no hope. How dare you go out with a big bad girl! Like? Didn\u2019t Yufi and I get along well from the beginning?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know how Princess Anisphere looked at Miss Uphilia, but from my point of view she was perfect. So, no one\u2019s coming in, he\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cHmm? Was Ufi that cold?\u201cOnly from my point of view, though\u201dI can point my gaze at you like I peep at you from Navre. I guess you\u2019re watching how Yuffi reacts when he tells you he\u2019s cold. Isn\u2019t that a good idea? I think so. I thought being royal, more emotions than necessary, was out of the way. No wonder Uffi was seen that way.I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a bad thing. No, not there. He\u2019s still young, too, and I don\u2019t know if you can tell me that Yufi means something cold, and I don\u2019t want you to know that and I\u2019m not talking about this.\u201cShall we get back to it? Anyway, Al took the lead and said he wanted to break his engagement and fight back. So?\u201d\u201c\u2026 so? What\u2026?\u201cNo, so what good were you guys going to get?\u201d\u201cProfits, profits\u2026 trying to correct mistakes, we are!\u201cOh, because I don\u2019t care about that. Don\u2019t bring up words like\u201d right \u201cor something on this topic. I hate it when people say things that affirm emotional theory.\u201dStab the nail first. Correct mistakes and pierce justice. I think that\u2019s a good word. If you want to talk about it. But when they do it in the political world, it\u2019s a bit of a hassle.If that\u2019s what the winner said, I can still swallow it. It\u2019s just a theory of thought if someone who hasn\u2019t won or lost talks about it.\u201cShall I rephrase it? When I say your interests, can I say that Yufi wanted to make her position better by surfacing her mistakes and making her apologize for her unfair treatment of Miss Raini?\u2026\u2026\u201cNo?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cHa!\u2026 With that said, maybe it is\u201d\u201cUm, enough to be. You guys acted so presumptuously, you know, Ufi is a kid who doesn\u2019t listen to people for a long time, right? That\u2019s certainly cold.\u201dNavru-kun turns a bewildered glance at my words. No, what? I simply want to confirm the facts. I just want to pursue what the origins are and how they traced it.\u201cPrincess Anisphere is on Uphilia\u2019s side, isn\u2019t she\u2026?\u201cFrom a protective standpoint, I\u2019m on your side. So if you\u2019re at fault with Uffi, why don\u2019t you just make it right? I think so. In fact, there was a verse about Yufi trying not to be too emotional, and I don\u2019t think you can help if you don\u2019t have enough gaps or feelings to be hated.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Still, do you take Uphilia\u2019s side?\u201cI hope you don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019m sheltering Uffi because Alkun unilaterally strangled Uffi. I wouldn\u2019t even be stuck in my neck if we were discussing this in agreement. Oh, sorry, you broke into the venue\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know if I would have sheltered Ufi that far if it hadn\u2019t been for that coincidence. Though it is unlikely that he would have gone scouting after all to spare the talent unleashed on the field. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s possible that it didn\u2019t.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys discuss this with Yufi? Were you so stubborn that Uffi refused to negotiate?\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s it. If you don\u2019t have ears to listen to, think.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have it?\u2026\u2026\u201cCould it have suddenly been disputed? Without warning?Navru-kun silenced me with a strong expression in my inquiry. When I saw Navre, who had been silent, I could not bear to zero my sigh as if I were frightened.\u201cHey, Navre. I want you to think about it. From what I can tell, it just seems like you trapped Uffi, who came to diplomacy without declaring war.\u201d\u201cSuch a big deal!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s war because you put on an aristocratic outing. Navru-kun suddenly navru-kun\u2019s actions are irrelevant, so I\u2019m going to rebuff you! If they say so, will you shut up?Navru-kun\u2019s complexion is getting worse and worse. Keeping his mouth down, he is folding his back slightly. No, although I can hear you whining small.Shut up to wait for Navru-kun to calm down. I\u2019ve been leaning over without saying anything for a while, Navre, but I look up and see you.\u201c\u2026 Calmed down? Can I continue my story?\u201c\u2026 Yes. But let me just ask you one thing. Why are you doing this\u2026?\u201cI just want to pursue it. What happened and what was the problem? If you\u2019ve caused problems, you can reflect. If I have to make amends, I will go where I should. Laugh it off if you can laugh at it to the point of scolding it. I can\u2019t go back to what happened, and I can\u2019t do what I didn\u2019t. Then I\u2019m just thinking next.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dNavru-kun, who is completely grown up, nods with a pale complexion.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m distracted, can I ask you something too?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cWere you in love with Miss Raini?\u201c\u2026 I thought he was a poor kid. I need to protect you. She seemed like a child. If you make an effort, you work hard for me. He leans in without saying anything when it\u2019s hard. When I say I\u2019m in love, I do think I was attracted to her\u201dHmm. If you do just ask, it feels like a pretty girl of dim fortune, and she may be tempted by her manhood.\u201cOh well. Weren\u2019t you in a low position and not originally a child of nobility? That suddenly puts you in an aristocratic college, and if you\u2019re in trouble, you want to give me a hand. If Miss Raini says she\u2019s a good girl, it\u2019s all the more so. That\u2019s why the means you chose are not good.\u201d\u201cSo how do I\u2026\u201d\u201cNow you can do it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u201d You just have to ask someone, \u201cto someone who\u2019s going to be able to fix it. In Yufi\u2019s case, I guess Al. Because we have equal standing. Before the rebellion, I might have offered to talk to the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house. It\u2019s not like your father doesn\u2019t have feelings for you if Uffi is so tyrannical, is it? I wonder why we chose to solve it ourselves. I don\u2019t know that, and I think that\u2019s your failure.\u201dAnd you\u2019ve been a little curious to hear about Navre.\u201cAl told you about the bullet, didn\u2019t he?\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWas Miss Raini happy about that?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI heard Miss Raini was pleased. Did Miss Raini tell you that\u2019s what she wants you to do? I\u2019m under the impression that you\u2019ve heard so much about it, it\u2019s good to go out and solve that kind of use of force! I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be happy to raise his hands.\u201dNavru-kun stopped the movement like it was frozen. I trembled as if the magic had been lifted, and I shrunk to grab both my arms.\u201c\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cNavru-kun\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s good for her.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what have I done\u2026?I answer nothing to Navru-kun\u2019s soliloquy, who has covered his face with both hands. To me, who is not a party, all I can say is the facts that I have observed.Maybe it seemed to fit correctly and righteously into good results if viewed from a perspective I didn\u2019t know about. But I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a good story. They were the ones who were stupid when they did what they had to fail to do no matter how they fell.At the time of occurrence, the viewpoint of the observation will be defined at the time the result is achieved. It would only be strangers like me or as much as I like to look at the process. I can\u2019t believe I prefer to devote my efforts to seeking truth and truth.People live by what they are taught. Do what you have to protect. Something to protect. That varies from person to person, and the way you protect it varies. No one complains if what it is is is just in the mind of an individual.But if it takes the form of being observed, its eyes are turned. Yes, they\u2019re going to point it at me. Later or later, it\u2019s too late to notice, and I can\u2019t change it anymore.\u201c\u2026 you say that love sickness is very similar to fever. I won\u2019t cover what you did, but you were invaded by the disease. Maybe there\u2019s room for sympathy. All I can tell you is that you\u2019re sad.\u201d\u201c\u2026 did we, from the Anisphere\u2019s point of view, make a mistake?\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to think carefully about what you\u2019ve done. I guess the fever of love sickness has caught your blood and cooled off a long time ago? Changing your perspective is an essential skill in pursuing things.\u201d\u201c\u2026 tough guy, the princess\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, you are. Adults are bothering me and wiping my ass. We\u2019re kids, kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026 really tough\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re angry. Whose fault do you think restored the right to inherit the throne? Don\u2019t bother.\u201dI totally dropped my shoulder and leaned down, Navre. Kun\u2026. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s any more, I guess he just suffers. It\u2019s not like I want to hunt down Navre. It\u2019s time to pull.\u201cFinally. Miss Raini isn\u2019t the kind of girl who falls for someone, is she?\u201c\u2026 Yes. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d\u201cThen that was an unfortunate rubbing mistake. Or maybe they were all equally stupid and bad. Failure is what anyone does. What a handful of successes. If it\u2019s easy to grasp, everyone won\u2019t have a hard time.\u201dTake a seat and turn your back. I could hear enough of what I wanted to hear. I am satisfied as far as I am concerned with more material for reflection. Whatever happens to Navru-kun later, it just seems like he can honestly work hard enough. I don\u2019t want you to do anything else. True.I guess you found out I was leaving. Navru-kun inquired, keeping his face down.\u201cLet me hear it from you, too\u2026. What is Miss Uphilia like?\u201cHe was the only one who could have been a queen. As a support for the king, he killed me as an individual to become a symbol of guiding the country, and he became cold. You\u2019re a sweet kid for your country, but you might have been cold for people. I guess she\u2019s too nice to be nice anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that right? Thank you.\u201dTo the voice on my back, I told him this without turning around.\u201cIntroducing you at last\u2026. no matter how depressing, stupid, stupid, and hopeless you are. Still, it\u2019s surprising that a parent can give a child a hand. If you feel that way, I suggest we discuss it.\u201dI won\u2019t hear back from Navre. Open the door and leave the room. I had eyes for the Knights Commander, who stood outside the room in his absence. He looked at me with an unspeakable look and bowed his head without saying anything.Without saying anything more, I left the Count Sprout family behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: 16The night I came home from Count Sprout\u2019s house, I was wearing my arms in my own room and bothering my head.The impression I heard about Navru-kun is that it is still the result of the outburst of admiration for Miss Raini, mainly Al-kun. I also feel like Miss Raini has no thoughts there. Though not yet definitive.From the impression I\u2019ve heard so far, it\u2019s hard to believe Miss Raini is up to something. In other words, the failure of Al Kun and his team in this case will be on their own. When this happens, Al will have to bring it back on his own to overturn his assessment from this failure.\u201c\u2026 are you okay, Al?\u201dHonestly, Al is in great trouble if you don\u2019t do your best. It is very difficult for me to inherit the throne. Whatever you scratch, all you see is a future that will raze the country.That\u2019s the side that got caught up if she also said that Miss Raini doesn\u2019t have any thoughts. More than all this fuss, I don\u2019t know where you stand.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019d like to see it straight once or so,\u201dAbout 80% of my suspicions of Miss Raini ended up digesting in me. Navru-kun didn\u2019t even seem to be thought guided by someone. When that happens, it is Al who will raise the priority of the problem.Al, if my judgment keeps going crazy because of my eroticism, the trouble is that I have to take the throne. It\u2019s a frightening future. I don\u2019t want to be a king. And a queen like no other before.\u201cI just want to live a life of studying magic and developing magic tools with ease.\u201dUnexpectedly blurry. This unintentional situation is disgusting as the sludge seems to get entangled. Though I thought I\u2019d just fall asleep, my head is getting weird today.What\u2019s the catch in plundering this corner of thought? Because you\u2019ve come up with the possibility of becoming a queen? How do you know what those people at the center of the case were thinking? Caught. Yes, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s no theory, no basis, intuition\u2026 -.\u201c- Dear Anis, are you still awake?Delayed in thought, he rounds his eyes to the voice he hears from across the door with the sound of a knock. If I ran over to the door for a small run and opened it, Uffi was already standing ready to go to bed.\u201cUfi? What\u2019s going on?\u201cMay I have a moment?\u201cI don\u2019t mind, what\u2019s wrong?Invite Yufi into the room to sit in a chair for visitors. Though I let the interaction at Count Sprout\u2019s house go past my head for a moment, it soon disappeared with dew.\u201cWant something to drink? You can serve tea right away, right?\u201cSo can I have it?\u201cOkay, sweetheart.\u201dI have a set of magic tricks in my room so I can have tea right away. I like it because it\u2019s easy to drink tea, although it\u2019s no match for Ilia\u2019s brewed tea.Also, my father told me to bring the same type of magic props for myself, so I\u2019m giving them to him. It may begin to spread to the aristocracy and among the civilian population once safety has been established and mass production guidelines have been put in place. I also feel like I can\u2019t wait just a little when I think about that day.Finish preparing your tea, recommend it to Uffi, and then I\u2019ll sit down and have a cup of tea too.\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201cWhich way was Master Anis going out today?Yuffi asked looking straight at me. I put my breath down for a cup of tea I prepared myself.Well, I wonder what\u2019s going on. Should I tell Yufi that I was listening to him around the college? I don\u2019t know if I feel bad talking to you. Think about what to do\u2026 I decided to speak honestly. Because it\u2019s a problem that involves him, he won\u2019t be able to cut off his involvement no matter what.\u201cTo the Earl Sprout family. I\u2019m here to see Navre.\u201d\u201cTo Master Navre?Yuffi looks a little surprised and then turns into a complicated look. I didn\u2019t really care there because I knew that Navru-kun\u2019s topic wouldn\u2019t be a pleasant one for Yufi.\u201cA lot. What were you thinking, thinking? I thought I\u2019d find out if there were any conspiracy guidelines there.\u201d\u201cIs Master Anis himself?\u201cThe right to inherit the throne rolled in, and I can\u2019t help but interpret to leave this case alone. At first, I asked the Knights of Sprout what was going on, and I wanted to talk to him. You can\u2019t even get caught up in something.\u201d\u201c\u2026 have the doubts been resolved?\u201cWhat about 80%?That said, have another sip of tea. Uffi was silent, but he immediately raised his face and threw the question at me.\u201cHow was Master Navre?\u201cI was depressed when I talked properly. I think if I explained what I did, I\u2019d find out. Even if you can reflect, it\u2019s up to you to rewind from here.\u201d\u201cWas it\u2026\u201dYufi\u2019s voice has no power, his expression remains dark. I knew you\u2019d be sick. It hasn\u2019t been that long, and it hasn\u2019t all worked out.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know about love sickness\u201d\u201cLove sickness, is it\u201d\u201cEven though I know it sounds like a fever, I don\u2019t know how to treat it because I don\u2019t feel it. Take care, at best.\u201d\u201cDoes Master Anis think falling in love is like being sick?\u201cI\u2019m sick in the sense that my mind is no longer normal and I can\u2019t make the right decision. It\u2019s a nasty disease with no pills on it.\u201dLove is an overflowing expression of emotion. Something I can\u2019t keep inside me, strong thoughts. That\u2019s why love is a pain in the ass. I\u2019ve never felt it myself, so I\u2019m just aware of it.\u201cIt\u2019s an annoying story, not at all\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you would accuse others of being annoying\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m sorry\u2026. Well, if you say you\u2019re in love with magic, you can\u2019t deny it. No, what do you say? I guess my thoughts on magic are already in the realm of love\u201d\u201cIs love different from love?\u201cMmm. I\u2019m not, I guess. It\u2019s only due to subjectivity.\u201dLove is something to fall for. If you ask for it, you won\u2019t stop, it\u2019s like a severe fever that fills your heart with augmentation.What is love against? It is my belief that love is something to be, something to be.\u201cI think love is natural. It becomes natural to love someone or something. It\u2019s becoming commonplace, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t realize it unless I\u2019m conscious. And when you realize love, it deepens. I think love is a lot like the truth.\u201d\u201cIs it the truth?\u201cPeople can live without love, but with love, they become richer. That\u2019s all it takes to be rich. If there\u2019s nothing there to fill you up with, you can know you\u2019re filled with something. I think it\u2019s great.\u201dUltimately, people can live without love. Still, people can\u2019t disconnect with others because they have the ability, the heart, to love someone.Born as something with a heart. I love something. That\u2019s natural. It just takes a pursuit to call it love, and you might not even recognize it as love without a hang-up.Love is a cut of love, and love may lead to love. I can\u2019t talk about love. It\u2019s me, but I can talk about love. Because I can clearly say that\u2019s what makes me who I am right now.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if Master Anis is an idiot or a genius\u201dAll of a sudden, you\u2019re being rude.Fools and geniuses say it\u2019s a piece of paper, but even I don\u2019t have a pattern for preaching. Navru-kun, \u2019cause he realized it himself. It wasn\u2019t because I preached, it was just a conversation with me hanging up.Exhale and stare at Yuffi\u2019s face. Yufi was laughing and dropping her gaze like she was in some trouble. Staring unexpectedly at his worried expression, he turns his expression to a bitter smile whether he realizes that Uffi is being seen.\u201c\u2026 I think so. You\u2019ve been so good to me, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll stay this way.\u201d\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201cIf I were you, Anis, I\u2019d feel like you\u2019d answer me.\u201d\u201cOf course I answer. Yufi suited my eyes with that talent and effort. He\u2019s a natural right. It\u2019s not for Al, it\u2019s not for Navre, it\u2019s not for Miss Raini.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026. I know it\u2019s important to rest and to stop. But it\u2019s kind of too calm, I don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201dLike some trouble, Uffi distorts his expression and strokes the edge of the cup in his hand with his finger.\u201cSo what is it? I was wondering where you went today. Ever since I left, I\u2019ve seemed to be worried about something. So what\u2019s bothering my mind is that I\u2019m sorry about what happened\u2026\u201d\u201cUffi never feels responsible. You\u2019re the victim, Yuffi.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026. I guess there was something wrong with me. Otherwise nothing went wrong. Different?\u201cI wouldn\u2019t deny that either\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s not like Uffi has no responsibility. But I also think it\u2019s force majeure. Yufi was trying to be perfect as a queen without feeling more in love than she had to be. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s bad in itself, I just think we should have asked others to understand.And it was Al who should understand. I don\u2019t think Al has room for discretion in that regard. That\u2019s why I think Al is totally bad, because some of us aren\u2019t, and it\u2019s kind of complicated.\u201c\u2026 where it ends\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to give up on someone being bad\u201dI wish we were all happy, and I want it to be a wish that everyone thinks it is at the same time.But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way for humans to understand. I felt so bad about it. I don\u2019t dream anymore, I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019m not saying I never thought so.Bad men are bad, and sin must be punished and atoned for. I know that people can make a difference compared to humans and dye their hands for bad things, and things roll for bad things.Lots of people don\u2019t understand each other. Reality is always boring. Sometimes I can\u2019t help but hang up and remember my old dreams.\u201cMagic was ideal for me, wasn\u2019t it? With magic, you can make everyone happy, you can smile. That\u2019s what I thought, and I believed, and I wanted to stay believing. So maybe I\u2019m obsessed with magic. Reality isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you listen to yourself like this. It\u2019s like when you get bored, you get dissatisfied.\u201dThere are not many people who can talk about this. So I stick to my heart like a starch and accumulate. If I had been able to immerse myself in research, I wouldn\u2019t have had to think about that, but I\u2019m not going to be able to.At least until Al-Kun becomes king or I become queen. It\u2019s more of an issue we have to face than the right to inherit the throne is back. It is inevitable and necessary to protect this country.\u201cMutual, that\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s right\u201dTea tastes a little unsavory and still doesn\u2019t taste good. But the taste of tea was just as good for my current mood as it was a little bitter.\u201cLately, I think it\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough excitement!\u201cHow are you in the morning, princess?\u201dThe next morning, I took a good night\u2019s sleep and thought to myself, Yes, trying to relieve stress.It is indeed important to enrich the foundations, and it is now possible for Uffi to take the stage. That\u2019s why the waves don\u2019t stand better when you\u2019re grown up.I can\u2019t believe I was thinking that way, maybe this thing that would have been with me got too grown up. To say that humans live every day fulfilling their desires!Viva research! Yes, let\u2019s start something new! If you\u2019re immersed in new research, forget what you don\u2019t like!\u201cI wonder what\u2019s good for that. Any good ideas? Yufi, Ilia\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cEven if suddenly they say\u2026\u201d\u201cI was wondering if I could get a stranger response than a princess.\u201dWhat\u2019s bizarre, bizarre? Sometimes an idea blossoms from a trivial word.But in fact, what good would it be if I said I\u2019d get my hands on something new? I feel very strongly about challenging things I\u2019ve never done before.\u201cWhat inventions have you ever had? Flying magic props, handy demon swords for personal protection, engraving of my Arcane shell, Anis\u2019s dragon, and all the supplies used in this outhouse\u2026 that\u2019s where I know it.\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s more or less what\u2019s in shape.\u201dDaily supplies magic props made from the desire to make life more convenient. Although that is only used in the outhouse, mass production is not that much. Because for convenience and high demand, we want to keep checks in mind so that there are no accidents. Otherwise, there\u2019s no budget.If it is to be used on a daily basis, many factors of injury and accident will be attached. I want to eliminate the elements that make me as dangerous as I can be. All this has to be carefully packed with research.\u201cI want to magically fly the sky, make my life easier, I want to make something that looks good\u2026 my dreams are mostly coming true. Yeah, you feel like you\u2019ve been stuck with ideas lately, too. Don\u2019t you want to open the door to a new world?\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Nori, Uffi!\u201cEven if they say so\u2026\u201dYufi is smiling bitterly like trouble. Uh-huh, I wonder if I can do something new. Something that can write off the stress you feel in this situation all at once!\u201cA few opinions from me on that\u201d\u201cOh, Ilia. What is it?\u201cAll of a sudden I have trouble telling you to come up with an idea, but thanks to your coming to Uphilia, I can fill what the princess has never had enough of, so I guess I can do it on the axis there too\u201d\u201cDoes that mean magic?\u201cYes. A princess cannot use magic so much as magic. This is a well-known fact.\u201dYeah. You can\u2019t use magic even if you have magic. That\u2019s a guy called Common Sense who knows me well.\u201cSo many of the magic props used by princesses were created to use magic to replicate magic pseudo-or to make effective use of magic, but they have one thing in common.\u201d\u201cIs that what we have in common?Uffi leaned his neck in doubt. What demonic props have in common. I think Ilia wants to say that in the sense that it can be seen by what I\u2019ve been making. I have one thing in mind, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a corner, so why don\u2019t you answer Yuffi?\u201d\u201cYea!?\u2026 is that what demon props in general have in common?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I have no idea. Including flying magic props, arcane shells, and this out-of-home daily necessity, right? What do we have in common there?\u201d\u201cWell, in that classification, arcane shells can actually be the exception.\u201d\u201cIs Arcane Shell an exception?\u2026 I don\u2019t know any more\u201dYufi frowned like she was in trouble. Well, it\u2019s just not looking that way because of the novelty or the impression that it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201cUffi is pathetic, and can I ask you to match your answers? Ilia.\u201d\u201cYes, the common denominator of magic props is\u201c simple. \u201c\u201c\u2026 simple?\u201cIn other words, in principle, there is one function that can be used with one demonic prop. So arcane shell is the exception. I can say one thing in the sense of assisting Master Uphilia with her magic.\u201cThat\u2019s true. But if it was made for that purpose, wouldn\u2019t that be normal?\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. But aside from the magic props that tried to make the most of the magic, the magic props that tried to reproduce the magic\u201c didn\u2019t have to be made because \u201d, Master Uphilia. The princess cannot use magic. I mean, it\u2019s hard to apply.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI leaked my breath to say that Uffi gradually understood Ilia\u2019s allegations.\u201cThat\u2019s all magic can be used for applications\u2026. and if you want to make magic props, it\u2019s complicated, with multiple features, and a princess would be able to design them. But the princess doesn\u2019t make it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201cBecause it makes it less user-friendly. Then you should make the functionality simple and easy to understand from the start. That\u2019s the princess\u2019s theory, isn\u2019t it?\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not what the princess wanted to do. The princess wants to be free to use magic. If it was meant to be, it would also make magic props that combine multiple functions. But don\u2019t make it. If it\u2019s true, right?\u201cMagic is dangerous.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because if you have magic, you don\u2019t know what uses magic props can be used for when they can be used in a variety of applications?\u201cYes. That\u2019s the problem\u201dMana Blade, for example. I only made that one so that it could be used as a sword, although it has some derivatives. The same goes for the daily necessities used in the outhouse, and even the flying magic props can only be used for flight.This also makes sense to make it easier to handle. The more complex the features, the more confusing it can be. This was really necessary in view of any mass production. Tools that don\u2019t take 10,000 people are obsolete.And another reason. Because making it easy to apply is likely to be abused.In the unlikely event that my magic is used by malicious people, I don\u2019t know what things I make for someone will turn into in application. That is a good example of the dynamite of previous life.That was originally made for construction purposes. It\u2019s definitely in people\u2019s interest to use it right. But dynamite turns fast into a weapon if used in war. I think I have to assume as much as I can how convenient technology will be used to bring it to the world responsibly.Even Mana Blade is pretty dangerous in that sense. Though I think it is very well done for protection, if this is in the hands of the assassin, it will turn into a dark vessel quickly. I want to eliminate these anxiety elements as much as I can.\u201cThe princess is not a troubled one with broken personality and common sense\u2026\u201d\u201cIlia, terrible!\u201cI won\u2019t admit no. Either way, I\u2019m not making tools to annoy others. But as you mentioned earlier, Arcane Shell is, in a way, an exception.\u201d\u201cSurely the Arcane Shell has both the Devil\u2019s Sword and the Devil\u2019s Wand functions, even if they are few.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I can\u2019t handle for a princess, but it must have been just right for Master Uphilia. The fur color is slightly different from the princess\u2019s inventions so far.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s different from a mass product and a bespoke one.\u201dIf I said that, my engraving would be different. I don\u2019t envisage letting you use that technology other than me. I\u2019m not going to do mass production or anything.\u201cI\u2019m assuming mass production is in anticipation of the future, but I thought it was one of the reasons why no one would let me use it right away?\u201cI don\u2019t deny that either\u2026\u201dBasically I don\u2019t make a good impression from a wizard. There was no such thing as a wizard treating me amicably, and I gave up on that, too.So even if you want to use magic, you look back at yourself and think that you\u2019ve made something more usable for everyone than something you can freely use.\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we just get back to where we started and see it now?\u201cOrigin?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t the princess handle magic freely?\u201dI accidentally rounded my eyes to the words told me by Ilia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17: 17The only reason I can\u2019t use magic is because it\u2019s a magic power that is not liked by the great spirits of magic. I mean, it\u2019s a matter of innate physique. Without the magic favored by the Spirit, I cannot use magic via the Spirit.But there is magic, so we have developed magic tools that can be used for a variety of purposes, so that we can use magic pseudo. There were ideas from previous life\u2019s knowledge, and they created new concepts that were not found in existing magic.Can I use magic like that? In my opinion it is probably not possible in previous studies.Then is it possible acquired to pervert magic as the Spirit likes it? It could certainly be interesting to look into it there.\u201cBut what do you think I should do? I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the Spirit doesn\u2019t like me anymore from the soul stage.\u201d\u201cIn Master Anis\u2019s theory, magic is like blood zeroed out of your soul. The fact that magic doesn\u2019t fit means it doesn\u2019t fit with the Spirit from the soul, right?\u201cI guess in theory it will. Though I find it difficult to clear this issue.\u201d\u201cYes, as far as I can hear, I think so too\u201dMe, Yufi, and Ilia\u2019s perceptions coincide. I can\u2019t make magic by degenerating the Spirit until we do something about this biggest problem.\u201cYou\u2019re the one I want to check, Princess\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf a princess can handle magic, it\u2019s okay to go through magic props, right?\u201cRight. If the results get there as well, I don\u2019t care if they say it\u2019s pseudo, do I?Because it\u2019s important to be able to use it. It\u2019s the magic props that I made as a way out because I want to use magic in the first place but don\u2019t deserve to enter that entrance.Besides, magic and magic props don\u2019t exist in conflict. There may be magic props for magic aids. That\u2019s like Uffi\u2019s Arcane Shell.\u201cThe princess has produced several success stories so far. Two separately, one is a magic prop. And it\u2019s a demon-mediated inscription.\u201d\u201cDo you dare to divide there?\u201cI\u2019ll split it. And I wondered, Princess.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cDid the engraving necessarily have to be engraved on your own flesh?Uh, yeah. That\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t even think about it, but hey\u2026Engraving uses paint with devil stones and other materials in the material. It\u2019s a mechanism to take this in as a part of yourself by taming your body.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t. However, depending on the nature of the Demon Stone, the use is limitless, and most importantly, because I don\u2019t know\u201c what can be done in a vessel \u201dwhen it is inorganic, I wonder if it is large that I was afraid of failure and couldn\u2019t get my hands on it. If I fail, it\u2019s all gone. Too risky.\u201d\u201cYou used Dragon\u2019s Demon Stone on yourself in that risky way?\u201cUh, uh, I can\u2019t hear you, I can\u2019t hear you\u201dNow that I think about it, it was a good place to play, but I was just desperate. I want to be able to use magic.There was also certainty that it would succeed. Because I\u2019m \u201ccursed\u201d for killing a dragon.Whether it be a dragon, or he that slew a dragon, or a dragon, or a strong one. I always feel that residual thought, and when I head into battle, I think it\u2019s the leftover incense of the dragon that affects what should be called a repercussion, a curse. I don\u2019t say it because I worry about it when I say it around me.\u201cAs far as it goes. So it\u2019s inefficient to carve an engraving into a magic prop.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to make it because even if I make it, I\u2019m going to be made to order, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to succeed. Materials are more than limited. It sounds interesting to try, though.\u201d\u201cI see. Now let\u2019s leave this suggestion aside\u2026. Dear Anis, by the way. Demon Stone is a subspecies of spiritual stone that accumulates power and is created in the body by spirits being preyed upon by demons, right?\u201cYeah? Right.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t people make demon stones?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It solidified by accident.Build people\u2019s magic stones?\u201c\u2026 theoretically not possible, is it? Yeah.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a substitute for a medium that uses magic?\u201cI know it depends on the nature of the person. I just don\u2019t feel like trying. If I say that, I\u2019m telling you to do the same thing as a named demon, right? He said he\u2019d definitely come out of his mind or something.\u201dMagic is like blood with no entity to zero out of your soul, taking in excessive spirits and degenerating them into demonic stones. I don\u2019t think people can tolerate that, and I\u2019m too optimistic to say that if they can tolerate it, it won\u2019t have a negative effect.Even if you can create a demon stone using the same procedure that generates a named demon, I feel it\u2019s an area where you shouldn\u2019t put your hands on it. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m not Mad. Oh, I might do it if I was an experimental subject.\u201cSo we just have to make it in a different way than the existing one, right?\u201cIf only there was such a way\u2026. come up with something?\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be possible for Master Uphilia to use the Great Spirit to make a pact?\u201c\u2026 Spirit covenant!I accidentally took a seat. Spirit covenant! of this country, the beginning of kings and nobles! Sure you could use that technique\u2026\u2026? No, too little information to draw conclusions. I breathe deeply to calm down and sit back in my seat.No, but the corner of Ilia\u2019s eye might be good. Although I cannot serve the Spirit, it may be possible for Uphilia, who has the magic of being liked by the Spirit, to make a special spiritual stone.\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I have many qualities with spirits, but I\u2019ve never met such beings as the Great Spirit or God?Yufi says with an anxious look on his face. He\u2019s a rare genius when it comes to magic, Ufi, but he hasn\u2019t stepped that far into the non-standard realm of boulders.Besides, spiritual contractors rarely go up on the surface stage because the state is surrounded and protecting them. They say they don\u2019t want it either.There\u2019s also a risk of kidnapping. For their own safety, it is better not to go on the surface stage if it is not necessary. This is what your father said, and I\u2019m convinced of it.\u201cHmm, but when it comes to looking into spiritual contracts\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll have to ask the Ministry of Magic\u201d\u201cYou honestly don\u2019t expect me to tell you. Unless the princess converts.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not abandoning spiritual faith!I just don\u2019t really have any connection to the thing called faith. You\u2019ve never felt grateful, have you? I can\u2019t use magic in the first place, and I don\u2019t really feel like believing.That\u2019s why I know you\u2019re being neglected by the Ministry of Magic. I don\u2019t care what the Ministry of Magic thinks myself, but they complain because I don\u2019t like them. Blasphemy against God, spirits, magic. Oh, it\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201cUm, I\u2019ve found a possibility, but it feels like it\u2019s on a reef. I guess we\u2019ll be collecting material for a while.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you meet with the Spirit Contractor of the Kingdom of Palletia? If you want to talk, you can ask directly.\u201d\u201cDo you think Father will let me see you?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a source of unrest for sure.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d let you see me.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m going to cry because I agree with you two.\u201dLet\u2019s chip.I do hear that there are contractors in our country who are under contract with the Great Spirit, but I have never heard of anyone somewhere. My father didn\u2019t tell me, and it\u2019s my father who thinks it\u2019s gonna be trouble when I see him.So for a while, an investigation into existing materials, legends and heritage. And then it\u2019s not a bad idea to go on an investigation in conjunction with an inspection to a land that is deeply connected to the Spirit. Thinking about it like this keeps coming up with things to do. You\u2019re starting to look forward to it!\u201cWell, here\u2019s another story in a distracted place\u2026 Princess\u201d\u201cAltered what? Ilia.\u201d\u201cThe princess will now have time to review her manners and mindsets as a royal family. Forgive me.\u201dI immediately stood up to kick the chair and let my body thrust into the near-field window. The crushing sound echoes and my body is thrown into the universe.\u201cEscape to freedom \u2013 \u2013 ugh!!\u201dWho would do such a terrible thing!Ilia jumps out the window just as she tried to escape with all her might as she did from behind.\u201cSomething lame!\u201cIs that what the princess was able to say? Dear Kingsguard Knights! As planned, capture the princess!!\u201dLooking at the landing spot, the knights were gathering to wonder if they had refrained. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that if I get caught, my feathery heart will be tied to a goose cross.\u201cNo one can bind me\u2026!I\u2019m gonna run, do my best!!\u2026 a few dozen minutes later, I was drawn to Ilia and pushed into my room. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201cNo studying. \u2013 Uh-huh.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like a child\u2026\u201dA few days after I was imprisoned in my room. I was protesting all over my body as I fell asleep on the bed. Why should I study as a royal now? You\u2019ve thrown me a spoon before!I won\u2019t be convinced if they tell me the truth because the right to inherit the throne has been restored. I was going to embark on some new research and research to relieve corner stress, but it\u2019s more of a stress build-up! Ugg, I hate everything!Yuffi sits on the edge of the bed stroking my head as I get depressed. Healing, Yufi is healing. He\u2019s my best assistant. I hugged him to the waist and pressed him against his forehead and he hated me. Shocked\u2026\u2026That\u2019s how I twisted with Uffi, and I heard him knocking on the door. Get your body up instantly and speak across the door.\u201cAnisphere is out right now. If you need help, leave a message\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, fool?\u201dIt was Father with Ilia who opened the door and came in.\u201cOh, Father, you\u2019re in a good mood. It was about time Anisphere couldn\u2019t stand the repetition of the plot, and she thought she would destroy the world and the rest of her heart.\u201d\u201cStop it. The kingdom will end if the Lord\u2019s heart is lifted without bounds.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if it was over!\u201cHow disrespectful is a fool!!\u201dShut up, Yasaguri Anis won\u2019t be bonded a bit or softly!\u201cI summoned Baron Cyan to the Royal Palace tonight. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll accompany Miss Raini.\u201d\u201cOh, is that an invitation to be present?My father\u2019s been saying things a little unexpected, so I get my place right.\u201cHmm. You were interested, too, weren\u2019t you?\u201cHappy then. If you look directly, you\u2019ll figure something out.\u201dNow you can finally worship the rumored Lady Raini. I\u2019m not looking forward to seeing what a candidate for the Dungeon Beauty actually looks like. I can\u2019t even just enjoy it. We have to decide how to treat them in the future.It\u2019s your father\u2019s job there, though. I\u2019m only discerning. Miss Raini is one of the key pieces in assembling the painting puzzle called this series of incidents.That\u2019s why Yuffi left a message.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t?\u201cPlease don\u2019t. I know you\u2019re not angry, but you need to listen to me calmly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok. We look forward to your return.\u201dAlthough Uffi has fallen down and dropped his shoulder, I can\u2019t help it all. I don\u2019t suppose even Yuffi\u2019s heart wound has healed. From here on out, you want to settle down a little bit with your adult possessions.For this reason, if you are to attend a place of sight, you must disguise yourself as a princess. Reluctantly, Ilia took me into a bath, from taking care of my skin to dressing. This takes longer than I thought. To be honest, it\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201c\u2026 I wish you\u2019d shut up. You\u2019re a good princess\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIlia, Ilia. You\u2019re gonna cry because of what you did to me when you put up with me? Princess, you\u2019re gonna cry, right?\u201cDon\u2019t waste your makeup because it breaks down.\u201d\u201cDisrespectful!After such usual interaction with Ilia, we head to the royal castle. I usually keep my mouth shut when I go to the royal palace because I\u2019m stuck away from the palace.The maids in the royal palace do me good, and the Kingsguard Knights people are casual. Well, now it\u2019s princess style, so smile carefully and rub it off.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s a fraud.\u201d\u201cI wish I\u2019d shut up\u2026\u201dYou, too! I remember your face!He leads me to a room where he waits until he sees me, taking a vow of vengeance against those who blur about me.\u201cNice to meet you, Anis.\u201dAnd the minute I went inside, I turned right and wanted to escape. Because there were people inside who didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201cOh, where are we going? Anis.\u201d\u201cHa, Mother\u2026\u2026! Why are you here\u2026!Silphine Mays Palettia, the mother who divided my blood. I am also the least minded person in the world.I\u2019m usually in charge of diplomacy in the Kingdom of Palettia, and it\u2019s about as rare as being in the Royal Palace\u2026 why are you here!?\u201cWhy are you looking at me? Heard Algard declared his engagement to Ufilia broken, and you told him to take care of diplomacy for that matter?\u201cNo, it is, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI do hope you have moxibustion in Algard, but I am delighted that your right to inherit the throne has been restored. Now we\u2019re going to have a chance to burn a little bit of common sense in that tongue-in-cheek head.\u201d\u201cNo, you know, yes\u2026\u201dcan\u2019t really get my head up on my mother\u2026\u2026! As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve heard that it was quite difficult to give birth and that both mother and child were in danger.So my mother was having a difficult birth. So she adored me so much that it didn\u2019t hurt to put me in her eyes. He\u2019s a child with a stomachache, so he can\u2019t help but relax freely.All of a sudden, I\u2019m not getting married! I was shocked enough to pull a cage for a time because I threw down the right to inherit the throne, the name I proclaimed.I wish I had cared for my mother like that, but I was immersed in unscrupulous research because I wanted to use magic, so I rubbed it brilliantly, and my mother was transforming into a successful maiden jewel at the same time as she regained her spirit. It seems that you were your original personality and that you had a character breakdown in my child\u2019s cuteness.Back at Girl Jie, her mother moved vigorously to make no mistake about Al Kun\u2019s education. If Al doesn\u2019t have the talent to glow, he\u2019s a really energetic person, such as to advise his fianc\u00e9e to send Uffi, who was whispered to be brilliant, or to embark on his own diplomacy to win the rights of the Kingdom of Palettia.Note that I was in the mood for abandonment, if that\u2019s what you mean, let me try to accomplish it, but when I couldn\u2019t do it, it was your last time, and instead of saying that it was your last time, he aimed at the opportunity to re-educate me with a tiger\u2019s eye, and changed his mind because I had achieved something called magic.I mean, to get out of me, to shake my profits to the bone. If my father is a boss who understands, my mother is a boss with a strict norm. Sometimes I like to go out originally, and I\u2019m not really in the country\u2026\u201cPlus the first voice of reunion. That makes me sad, too. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a parent or something that just goes out\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true! Long time no see, Mother! Anisphere is very happy!\u201cMe too, Anis.\u201dDanger! I knew I was a bad parent, so I felt like I needed to be recognized as a parent again, and I was about to be ruined in the physical language.In fact, Mother\u2019s accomplishments are unusual. It seems like a woman is a good word for her mother. So much more famous than your father in terms of visibility in foreign countries. Still, my father and I are close, so I am relieved.Mother with the negotiating power and toughness to consolidate diplomacy and even the beauty envied by many women, to Father, who originally had a day long for those who compile internal affairs. It is no exaggeration to say that these two support the Kingdom of Palletia as pillars.I can\u2019t help wondering if that\u2019s why I had heavy expectations for Yufi, too.\u201cWell, Algard\u2019s not irresponsible when he says it\u2019s time to retire.\u201d\u201cWhat, are you retired?\u201cNaturally. I won\u2019t be sitting in a diplomat\u2019s seat forever. I grew up going backwards, and I thought it was time for me to leave.\u201dSeems like it\u2019s really my mother who thinks about backwards. Except for the fact that the physical language comes out a little bit quickly and that she\u2019s a female genius, she\u2019s a solid and attractive person. It feels like a working woman. Honestly, I admire it.And, in short, its height\u2026\u2026\u201cSomething?\u201cNo, nothing!My mother\u2019s height is smaller than mine. It\u2019s also a child face that makes you feel like a parent and child.Blue eyes with calm intelligence in burning red hair. If this is all you have, it\u2019s cool beauty, but you look like a girl. Overflowing young enough to make sense.Although childhood has faded because of its piercing locks, there is still an undeniable sense of chigging. That\u2019s also because I know the inside, and I think the word \u201cpoor\u201d still works if you look at your mother smiling without knowing anything.However, if you want to tell your mother that you feel sorry for her, you can put pressure on her with a smile. It\u2019s like having a big lion in this little body. For the compressed amount, I think it\u2019s probably getting stronger. Horrible.You\u2019re not always young with me.\u201cUh, ah, yes\u201dMake as many jokes as you can, and if I say so, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.Although my mother is not as versatile as Yuffi\u2019s spiritual aptitude, it may be said that she is specialized for that matter. That\u2019s also in terms of battles.Speaking of wind magic users, Mother. You think you swung a spear around the battlefield with that little body? A fierce man named for one of the strongest yet. The world is full of strange things.\u201cIlia, this stupid girl\u2019s gonna have a hard time all the time.\u201d\u201cNo, you will only be rewarded for that word\u201dIlia shows her respect to her mother with a perfect bow of grace. Well, you said it was one of the few people who could stop my rampage. I won\u2019t deny it either.\u201cI also wanted to meet Uphilia face-to-face, but I didn\u2019t want to. If I met her, she wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. Mother\u2019s a little shy.\u201dMy mother really tends to think of me as a tough person because of her constant strong image. Actually, it\u2019s tough, but there\u2019s deep love on the back of tough. It is the mother who runs through it vividly, because of her deep love.If you weren\u2019t someone who could go about it, you wouldn\u2019t notice. My mother also knows and uses her temperament, but she doesn\u2019t think anything of it. I think my mother is strong because I can use it separately.\u201cGive him a face-to-face look when he calms down a little more\u201d\u201cRight. I have a big job ahead of me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about Al.\u201d\u201cYeah, you were looking into that, too, weren\u2019t you? Can you give me your point of view?My mother asks for my views with a serious look. People associated with this uproar of Al Kun\u2019s breaking of his engagement, the course of the case, and what thoughts led him to the case?The mother who hears it is serious in itself. I keep my eyes open to say that I will not have a single piece of information.\u201c\u2026 this is my view\u201d\u201cThank you. So you think there\u2019s no such thing as a conspiracy, Anis.\u201d\u201cRight. About 80%.\u201d\u201cWhat about the other 20%?\u201cIt\u2019s a survey\u2026. It doesn\u2019t come close, it doesn\u2019t have a basis, it\u2019s really just an idea.\u201d\u201cI think your scratch makes sense. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell you that much, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet.\u201dMy mother nodded one, small and put her hand on her chin\u2026. I still think that my mother often trusts me with something that has no basis in my investigation.When I look at my mother\u2019s face out of so much doubt, my mother intertwines with the gaze directed at me.\u201cIt\u2019s about you. Even if I don\u2019t flatter you, I just think you deserve a reference. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be who you are right now. She\u2019s my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you, sir\u201dHe\u2019s not good, he\u2019s strong, he can\u2019t win, he\u2019s like a tough boss, though. Still, I couldn\u2019t really get my head up thinking this guy was my mother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18: 18\u201cHow was this outing? Mother.\u201d\u201cYep. I extended my legs further from my neighbor this time\u2026\u201dEnjoy conversation time with your mother until the time of sight. It is interesting, and above all I like, to convey and listen to the scenery, lifestyle, skills and culture that I have seen on the outing, although I am a tough mother. Because all this time, my mother also relaxes a little and speaks to rap.Time passed instantly that Ilia was interested in a conversation with the tea she prepared for me, and it was time for a glimpse.\u201cSilphine, Anisphere. Time.\u201d\u201cOh, you already are. See you next time, Anis.\u201d\u201cYes, Mother\u201dMy father and I are here to join the family and go to see each other. The number of people between the sights is minimal, and the escort is full of his father\u2019s belly, starting with the Knights of Sprout.As he waits with his spine stretched so as not to be ashamed of himself as a royalty, the two figures are passed between the sights.One is a big man. Characterized by sharp gray eyes on dark brown hair, the body is disappointed.The figure is a sweeping word. Such a man is dressed in an aristocratic style, which makes him look rudely out of place. He is Baron Cyan. It\u2019s a convincing appearance when you hear you\u2019re an adventurer originally.And next to it. It was Raini Sian, the young lady who was next to Al Kun at a party at the Aristocratic Academy, who came in to walk behind Baron Sian\u2019s step.Grey eyes that tend to lay low on glossy dark hair. She is a more luxurious girl who is more accentuated if arranged next to Baron Cyan.First of all, the impression I feel is very flashy, and my face is full of worry because of how depressed I am. Perfect when it comes to the beautiful girl of thin fortune.\u201cBaron Cyan. And her daughter, Raini. Well done.\u201dFather speaks to Baron Cyan and Miss Raini, who knelt down. Baron Cyan, still kneeling, looked nervous and seemed to feel sorry for this one watching. It looks like such a big body is shrinking small.\u201cRaise your face, allow me to speak\u201d\u201cHa! My wonder daughter is so rude this time! Please, forgive me!Baron Cyan kept his head deeply bowed, even though he told me how desperate it was to look up and be good. I think I\u2019m going to be in the dirt now. Baron Cyan is begging, as he pleads, with a voice commensurate with his physique.Though Father frowned a little, he promptly returned his expression and again urged Baron Cyan to raise his head.\u201cEasy, Baron Cyan. This time we set up a seat to shed light on the truth. Without knowing the truth, I\u2019m not going to blame anyone for their sins. Take it easy first.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ha, excuse me. Your Majesty\u2019s words, very stained.\u201dThe expression remained tense, but Baron Cyan finally looked up to me. I can see from wherever you look at it, it\u2019s tedious. Baron Cyan is in a hard position too, given his position. Though it may not be different from your father\u2019s in terms of his father\u2019s hardship.I don\u2019t get such a bad impression on Baron Cyan. The line that my parents were poorly educated also disappeared in me. With that in mind, I turn my gaze from Baron Cyan to Miss Raini. I still don\u2019t see Miss Raini\u2019s expression on her knees.\u201cThere were aspects of Algard\u2019s and Uphilia\u2019s broken engagement that were more difficult to navigate than they were. Algard approached his daughter and exchanged feelings.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a thing when you think about your identity. The concubine still hasn\u2019t thought about pushing her legitimate fianc\u00e9e\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you think Algard said it unilaterally?\u201cI won\u2019t say that. Indeed, my daughter Raini was sometimes adopted, and there were aspects of her education as a nobleman that were inadequate. Sometimes the college seems to annoy the prince\u2019s hands because of the deficiencies, but it is thanks for the assistance that we had\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Algardo was driven by outrage for Miss Raini and stood by the break-up and impeachment of her engagement. This is not true. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any love left.\u201dBaron Cyan has shrunk his shoulders in a frightened manner. Father shifts his gaze from Baron Cyan to Miss Raini.\u201cRaini Sian. Raise your face.\u201dSlowly Miss Raini looks up. I can\u2019t see the color of my emotions because I\u2019m nervous about my expression, because it\u2019s going to disappear now. I can\u2019t feel the light so much that those eyes even seem as if they were a void.What an adorable lady to look at again. I\u2019m also convinced that if this humorous atmosphere disappears and smiles, a man will be blinded.She is certainly a beautiful girl with a different colour than Yufi. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m a person to be honest with. Even if they say it\u2019s a doll, they might believe it for a moment.\u201cAllow me to speak. To be frank\u2026 didn\u2019t your Lord have feelings for Algard?Father asks frankly. The attention of the venue gathers to Miss Raini, in which Miss Raini opens her mouth without shaking her expression.\u201c- No.\u201dThat, my voice.I doubted my ears for a moment with such a beautiful voice. That\u2019s enough to put me in the illusion that I\u2019ve been ruled over this place.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a hell of a thing. I don\u2019t think I can afford to be like that. I preferred Master Algard, if I didn\u2019t say so, it would be a lie. But I never meant to darken the future of the royal family.\u201dEveryone hears a good talking voice. I\u2019m just saying that I can\u2019t miss the way Miss Raini lays her eyes down, or even the movement of her lips that trembled just to exhale.How much silence would have lasted. My father, who made me jump on his shoulder like I was getting back on my mind, coughs.\u201c\u2026 well. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying to me.\u201ddiscomfort. Such a feeling spreads, like a thin membrane stretched between perceptions.Nobody says anything to Father\u2019s words, and he lowers his gaze so that he can\u2019t help it.It\u2019s as if Miss Raini isn\u2019t bad, she\u2019s going to admit it. The air is spreading.\u201c- BOOKSHONG!!\u201dMy nose itched and I sneezed as much as I wanted.In another sense, the place quiets back down. The gaze concentrates from Miss Raini to me. Oh, no, my mother has a great smile. This could die later.Baron Cyan is looking at me with his eyes round, and Miss Raini is opening her mouth to surprise. I also saw my father stand up at ease. My shoulders are trembling heavily.\u201c\u2026 Anis\u2026 the guy named you\u2026 everywhere\u2026!\u201cChi, chi! Father! Forgive me for speaking! I have something to say to you, Anisphere!\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if it was an explanation!\u201cIt\u2019s not! Please, I need some time!\u201cYeah, you want a nose too!\u201cI\u2019d like some time to talk to Miss Raini!\u201cWhat no\u2026?All of a sudden my father glances at me with his eyes just saying what to say. But I can\u2019t pull all this off either. If it\u2019s a mistake or a concern, that\u2019s fine.But if my remaining discomfort and hiccups are correct, I can\u2019t leave them alone. First of all, I can\u2019t help but not understand the situation. For that reason, I want to be alone with Miss Raini to confirm something.\u201cFather. Please believe me. It\u2019s not all a joke, it\u2019s not a witch\u2019s game.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is it too much for you to say? Can\u2019t we find out more here?\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have any certainty yet\u2026\u201dFather staring into my face and silencing. Both Baron Cyan, Miss Raini and the head of the Sprout Knights, who was on the escort, have a bewildered look at me.You may, Your Majesty.\u201cSilphine?\u201d\u201cI believe in anise intuition. I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before she wants time.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 ugh. Can\u2019t we even have someone present?\u201cYes, please just the two of us. I have no intention of causing any harm. We\u2019ll be prepared to punish you for your lawlessness once you\u2019ve confirmed it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok. Let me show you two to the separate room. Is that all right?\u201cThank you\u201dLook, I exhale and stroke my chest down. After thanking his father, he also sends his gaze to his mother to be silent. My mother didn\u2019t say anything, she just nodded small.You couldn\u2019t keep up with the situation on the field, Baron Cyan and Miss Raini are just gazing at me. I walk up to Miss Raini like that and give her my hand.\u201cMiss Raini, give me your hand. I\u2019d like to take a moment.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 ha\u2026\u201dMiss Raini stands up flashly as she takes my hand in a frightened manner. Leave the room as you escort her. Soon Ilia followed me and opened the door.Keep going into a separate room in the nearby area, with Miss Raini in the guest room. Encourage me to exit the room to the Ilia that followed me, make sure the door closes and exhale.\u201c\u2026 Um\u201dMiss Raini looks at me without even trying to hide her anxiety. Let go of the hand you were holding, take a step away, and then smile.\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m sorry, I really need to check something out.\u201d\u201cConfirm\u2026?\u201cLet me look into you a little bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, I didn\u2019t really do anything\u2026!Turn your complexion blue and Miss Raini steps back. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, and I know full well that I\u2019m scared of fear.To be honest, I know her mental burden is enormous. But I can\u2019t snort.\u201cI want you to trust me to prove it\u2026. Oh, no. I understand you don\u2019t believe me. This is an order from the princess. I\u2019ll check on you, I know it\u2019s lame. I\u2019ll apologize later. But if we don\u2019t clear you up here, we\u2019ll put you at a disadvantage.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no\u2026\u201d\u201cI just need to get back to you. All right?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dMiss Raini leaked her desperate voice and leaned down. And around her back, gently crawling her fingers on her back.\u201cHeh, heh, what?\u201cShut up. Because I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cSo, but\u2026\u201dIgnore Miss Raini\u2019s reaction. Slowly crawl her fingertips through her body. He crawls through his spine, shoulders to arms, and fingers in turn to focus his consciousness.\u201c\u2026 excuse me\u201d\u201cHia!?\u201dThe next thing I turned my hand around was her chest. He touches his chest with his fingers as he presses her from behind to keep Miss Raini from moving, who screamed adorably.\u201c\u2026 hmm, I see. That\u2019s enough.\u201dUntie the hand that was restrained from behind and release Miss Raini. Miss Raini is looking at me with tears as she retreats to hold her body tight. It was going to make me cry now.Even though it was necessary, he stirred up a sense of crisis by touching his chest. A little awkward, but I exhale.\u201c- Huh!\u201dHe slaps his killer like a sew between breaths and grabs it for her neck. Miss Raini flaunted herself for being suddenly shocked to death and resisted anything.I don\u2019t grab her neck and snap\u2026 I stop right in front of her and look at Miss Raini\u2019s complexion. Turning bright blue, she fell to the spot with her legs trembling as they were.\u201cHmm, totally silo, I guess. Then\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, what is it!? What do you want! Why, I look at you like this\u2026!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Wow, Miss Raini finally cried out. I look down at her covering her face with both hands and then I try to get on my knees and gaze at Miss Raini.\u201cI made you cry. What am I gonna say, but I need you to listen to me a little more. I want to know about your parents.\u201d\u201c\u2026 my father is not involved in anything. Even I\u2019m up to something\u2026!\u201cUh, no. No, but no. There\u2019s more to what I want to make sure! Oh, why are you so troublesome already?\u201dI scream out of anger by accident. Keep sighing and speak to Miss Raini again.We have to make sure that all this is going on. Including her safety in the future.\u201c- Do you realize you\u2019re not human?Baron Lady Raini Sian. She is not a \u201cpure person\u201d.\u201c\u2026 human, not\u2026?Miss Raini\u2019s voice is trembling. It\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t understand what they said.I don\u2019t even know what it feels like. But seeing Miss Raini convinced me. Miss Raini shook her neck from left to right as she was convinced that I was serious because I did not stray from my gaze and stared straight at her.\u201cOh no\u2026 I am human! Consciousness, what, what are you talking about!?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s unconscious too?\u201cWhat is it?\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.\u201dMiss Raini\u2019s eyes open wide to my point. Zero small voices, I\u2019m holding my breath.\u201cIs it intrinsic to mental interference, the use of magic? I have a little knowledge of that hand thing. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s to this extent because I\u2019m unconscious, or if it\u2019s leaking because I\u2019m unconscious\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 me, isn\u2019t that normal?She inquired as Miss Raini exhaled a trembling exhalation as she remembered to breathe. I nod strongly at Miss Raini\u2019s inquiry and show her.\u201cYeah. Definitely weird.\u201d\u201cBye! Isn\u2019t it a coincidence that you\u2019ve been able to turn a hot gaze on people of all ages?!?\u201d\u201cUgh, yeah?\u201cAnswer me! Is that because of its charm or something?!? Has it always been!? Could I have used it earlier?!?\u201dMiss Raini comes stuck to me with the momentum to get herself out. I nod and show again and again as I grip to take Miss Raini\u2019s hand, which has been stretched.\u201cNo, I do all the time. I\u2019m a little under the circumstances, and I\u2019m intolerant of the magic of that hand\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that true!?\u201dIt was such a desperate phase that I nodded momentously and again. Then Miss Raini collapsed like she had lost her leg power.When I rushed to support Miss Raini aggressively, Miss Raini started crying out loud. I was wolfed by Miss Raini, who suddenly cried out.\u201cWhat, hey, why are you crying!?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 I was\u2026 crazy\u2026! They weren\u2019t all weird\u2026\u2026 hey\u2026! Wow, ahhh\u2026!!\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute\u2026\u2026! (a) Iliar! HELP!!\u201dHaving had trouble with Miss Raini, who suddenly cried out, I summoned Ilia, who was waiting outside the room, to calm Raini down with Ilia and the two of us.Miss Raini sits in a calm manner as she buzzes her nose. Ilia is removing makeup beautifully because the tears have broken her makeup.\u201c\u2026 have you calmed down?\u201cYes\u2026 sorry for the disturbance\u201dIt\u2019s rare for Ilia to speak up like she cares, but I feel like I\u2019ve chewed up a bitter bug.Miss Raini\u2019s \u201ccharm\u201d influence is very troublesome. Even if he is unconscious, he has propagated it around him. Of course, not with Ilia. It\u2019s more troublesome than I thought.\u201cThat\u2019s above all\u2026. So, Princess, can you explain?\u201cUh, okay. Well, then, Miss Raini, I\u2019d like to make a few checks. Is that okay?Many times Miss Raini nods like a child to my confirmation. That\u2019s a lot of honesty, and I\u2019m going to ask you a question.\u201cFirst of all, have you ever been liked or unusually obsessed with people for a long time?\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize it was happening\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know. Everyone likes me, but I get a little crazy, and I get so scared when I try to get my distance, I have to keep my distance\u2026\u201dMiss Raini\u2019s voice was trembling to the point where she was about to cry out again. That makes me feel the depth of the trauma Miss Raini has been experiencing. Too much sadness makes me choose words for boulders, too.\u201cWell\u2026 as hard as I may recall, your mother is dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201c\u2026 Yes. So I was kept in an orphanage and my father found me\u2026\u201d\u201cOh well\u2026\u201dI accidentally arm myself with a difficult face. I blink my eyes like Ilia says it\u2019s rare, but from the bottom of my heart I\u2019m in trouble, exactly now.\u201c\u2026 Um, Princess Anisphere. I\u2019m not human\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. To be precise, I think maybe half human, is right.\u201d\u201cHow can you say it is?It was Ilia, not Miss Raini, who returned the question to my reply. I answer immediately.\u201cI was just allowed to palpate Miss Raini\u2019s body. I found something in Miss Raini\u2019s body that no ordinary human being has.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what happened?\u2013 It\u2019s a demon stone.Demon Stone. That is what is present in Miss Raini\u2019s body. Raini also rounded his eyes in my reply, and Ilia looked at Raini as surprised.That\u2019s a natural reaction. Speaking of which, I wonder if Ilia and I had just talked about that before. By chance, what is the time to say it?\u201cWhat is Demon Stone\u2026 is it true?\u201cYeah. If you want to find out more, I want time, but I have a great idea. Good thing my investigation caught on. Miss Raini\u2019s life and this country were in danger if we were bad hands.\u201d\u201cOn my body, is there a demon stone\u2026?Miss Raini said she couldn\u2019t believe it. Looking down at her own body with her face. Demon stones can also prove to be demons. How shocked is Miss Raini that she was told that such a thing was in her body? I don\u2019t think I can figure it out for you.\u201c\u2026 so the princess decided Miss Raini wasn\u2019t human?\u201cI\u2019m staring at you for being half human, to be exact. Baron Cyan would definitely be human, wouldn\u2019t he? And suppose that\u2019s a real demon, it\u2019s pretty unsavory. It tastes so bad that I\u2019m in a hurry. It tastes so bad that I admire myself for being here.\u201dWhen I told him to push again and again, he tightened his face to see if Ilaria had also told him that I was in crisis.A human with a demonic stone in his body. Power enough to unconsciously attract others. What do you say without calling this dangerous? And I know there\u2019s such a dangerous demon in my mind. And if it\u2019s real, it\u2019s pretty unsavory.\u201c\u2026 Princess, what is that demon?Ilia has asked as she swallowed up the tension. I suppose you care about yourself, Miss Raini, and you\u2019re turning your gaze to me.I gave the two of them an answer, painfully and slowly exhaling.\u201c-\u201d Vampires. \u201cIt\u2019s an ogre monster who sips people\u2019s blood and manipulates advanced magic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19: 19\u201cVampires\u2026\u2026?\u201cAre you talking about that gaga story?Ilia and Miss Raini ask to confirm. Regardless, Miss Raini saw a rare and bewildering color on Ilia\u2019s face.Nothing strange about the reaction between the two of them. Vampires are nothing but gay tales, at least in the perception of ordinary people.Says a monster sipping people\u2019s blood. I can\u2019t keep my parents\u2019 word, and if the sun goes down and I\u2019m walking away, I can speak to a beautiful person.He\u2019s so beautiful, he sucks up blood and becomes one of the vampires when he follows him as he is invited.But no one has ever actually seen a vampire, and the damage has not been reported. So it is only the existence of the Goga story. It is thought to be a creation to make children listen.\u201cNot when you\u2019re a vampire, but you\u2019re trying to tell me that vampires are real.\u201d\u201cIs it not?Miss Raini and Ilia all aligned in my rhetoric and looked suspicious. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Because there is no certainty as to why. But if my hypothesis is correct, Miss Raini will still be a vampire.If we don\u2019t talk hypotheses, though we don\u2019t prove it, we can\u2019t move on. I open my heavy mouth in sigh.\u201cI say vampires are prototypes of vampires.\u201d\u201cVampire prototype?\u201cI have a story based on a vampire\u2019s gaga story. Hypothesis inferred from materials and artifacts with few records at the time. So there is no certainty. Still listening?\u201d\u201c\u2026 let me hear it\u201dMiss Raini nods with a serious look on my foreboding face. It\u2019s about me, so I guess I\u2019m desperate. I nod one at Miss Raini like that and keep explaining.\u201cI think the prototype of a vampire was born out of some wizard study.\u201d\u201cWizard, is it?\u201cYes. Vampires are those who magically embody immortality in a limited way. Half-dead, but one who fell into a demon who gained long lives by magical powers. That\u2019s the vampire.\u201dMiss Raini was relieved by the hypothesis I told her. Because of the tension, the hand I was holding on my chest is shaking. I keep talking pretending not to notice it.\u201cIt was a long time ago. I don\u2019t know exactly how many generations ago it was. It is certain that it was before the vampire\u2019s gaga story spread. There were certainly people who became archetypes of vampires in those days. The figure, read and painted from the remaining research material, is a man who risked his life on a magical quest, who fell into despair and madness with an understanding of the time of death\u201dIt\u2019s a coincidence that I found that record. I am surprised that there are vampires and named beings in this world, and I have been wondering where their origins came from.Working also as an adventurer, I coincidentally took the opportunity to browse the Wizard\u2019s research materials to become a prototype of a vampire. It is called a \u201cforbidden book,\u201d a book describing knowledge that should not be spread in the country. The research material was one such forbidden book.\u201cShall I call him for convenience? Being a prototype of a vampire, he was an excellent wizard. And by studying magic, he was trying to trace the truth of the world. But there\u2019s one difficulty with him.\u201d\u201cDifficulty\u2026\u2026?\u201cLife expectancy. No matter how capable a wizard is, it cannot withstand life expectancy. He has become afraid of death. I didn\u2019t do anything good to decay in the middle of the road. At the end of his talent and obsession, he has completed one study. It was about\u201d taking it away from others. \u201c\u201c\u2026 take away?\u201cIf you\u2019re old, be young. If you cannot make up for your own life, transfer it from one person to another. Take it away from the\u201d others 'so as to make up for what is missing. He has completed such magic. By incorporating the blood of others into himself as a mediator, he tried to cross life expectancy and limits\u2026. and I\u2019m guessing\u201d\u201cIs that a guess?Ilia asks me with a suspicious look on her face as she follows the story och. I guess it\u2019s because I was clouded at the end for talking so much. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to be honest with you.\u201cI also only read it from research material and all I had to do was fill it in with my imagination. I don\u2019t know the boulder until the details of the procedure, and I just guessed it in the first place, so I might be wrong. But if my reasoning is correct, the wizard has somehow gained the power to sustain himself by taking the blood of others while dying.\u201d\u201c\u2026 can you make magic like that?\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do. My ideas are flying by the time I just try, and my ethics as a person are broken. I didn\u2019t think it would be real if I couldn\u2019t even solve this place. But I had a tip.\u201d\u201cIs that a hint?\u201cIt\u2019s a demon stone. Yes, I built the Demon Stone. If you just can\u2019t reproduce it by magic, you can create a demonic stone that\u201d has the ability to fulfill what you want \u201c. In your own body.\u201dWhether the words I tell you were a shock, Raini covers his mouth with his hands. Ilia is breathtaking with rare eyes open.I said it briefly, but I just think of it as an act where human ethics are clearly broken. Not to mention what I wanted is like immortality. To feed others for this is more of a monster than a human being.\u201cA body with an approaching death period cannot produce enough vitality. Then you can take it from others. Generate the demonic stones necessary for this purpose and take life from others via blood. That\u2019s how Bakemono, a prototype of vampire heritage, was born.\u201d\u201c\u2026 does that really exist\u201d\u201cI was half-hearted until I saw Miss Raini. But there were speculations that it might be true. Because vampires are\u201d born of people \u201ddemons. Conversely, it does not occur naturally. \u2018Cause I was originally a\u201c human \u201d. Otherwise vampires will not be established. And I think it\u2019s like an infection for a vampire bite victim to be the same vampire.\u201dIf you can create a demonic stone, if it has the effect of degenerating people. And if you can increase that demon stone. If this is true. It also coincides with the legacy that the bitten person will be one of the vampires.\u201cI don\u2019t know if vampires are already moving on their own volition, or if they are being driven by demonic stone functions to operate\u2026. Anyway, no matter how magically good you are at transcending people, there are limits on your own. So what do you think we should do? Miss Raini!\u201d\u201cWhat!? What, um\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d\u201cThen give me the answer. The answer is to increase the number. And he became a vampire. I guess this is what he thought. You can embed the same demon stone. That way we\u2019ll all be the same creature\u201dMiss Raini breathed. I guess it\u2019s because I imagined the sight. Even I would be frightened if I imagined it.If you can embed the Demon Stone into your people, you can let the Demon Stone suck magic after that. If there is no ethic or nothing there that respects humanity, it can be done. In fact, I\u2019m doing something similar, engraving\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s probably why vampires used to be recognized and crusaded as demons. But people are learning creatures. Vampires derived from people, of course, may have thought about it. If you can\u2019t make a stand and move, you should be dispersed in the darkness. Until one day the time comes.\u201dAnd the vampire disappeared from the history of the table. But the vampire threat isn\u2019t gone. At the very least, it is possible that the story of Aga remained as a lesson so that people will not forget, and that time has changed its appearance.That\u2019s just a guess. Because there is an overwhelming lack of material to fill that conjecture and reality.\u201cThere have been no reports of vampire damage, or maybe they hunted it all down. Or are you lurking somewhere so you can\u2019t find it? I\u2019m most afraid you don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so, you know. Why did Princess Anisphere think I was a vampire?\u201cBecause it matches the hallmark of vampire heritage, the ability that vampires are predicting to be gaining if my assumptions were correct. Strong charm, mental interference close to brainwashing. It takes more of our own kind, and it takes more of us to get confused with the world.\u201dIt is believed that what was attacked by vampires became vampires and that being one of them was due to the power of this brainwashing. And the fact that vampires still have a legacy of being beautiful enough to lure people into it makes me wonder if they\u2019re either transformed or fascinated.\u201cLeaving aside whether Miss Raini is actually a vampire or not\u2026 no, that\u2019s the problem, but the other problem is piling up\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 let\u2019s sort it out. First, Miss Raini said she was a half of an estimated vampire and a thoughtful demon\u2026. Are you sure it\u2019s half?\u201cSo, like the magical experiment where Miss Raini was implanted with demonic stones? I don\u2019t know about that, and it doesn\u2019t even look like they\u2019re implanting demon stones and causing mental anomalies. If it happened to be the idiosyncrasies that the Demon Stone would become in your body, wouldn\u2019t that be the subject of an autopsy?\u201cOr autopsy!?\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a possible case of autopsy, although it\u2019s bad for Miss Raini, who\u2019s bluishing her face. Anyway, I don\u2019t know any other examples. Even if the autopsy goes too far, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll kill you.\u201cWhether Miss Raini is really a vampire or not, that\u2019s a problem, but it\u2019s not. The issue that must be given the utmost importance is the power of Miss Raini. He\u2019s fascinated without consciousness, and his effect is enough to captivate the children of powerful men, starting with the royal family?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste good, no matter what you think. The country will be disrupted even if he wants it or doesn\u2019t want it. You can\u2019t let that happen.\u201dIlia shrugged frowning. Yes, there\u2019s actually confusion going on because of the people Miss Raini confused me with.\u201cAnd if Miss Raini was truly a vampire, the fact that the vampire lived to modern times is confirmed. It is possible that Miss Raini will be used in human experiments to explore countermeasures against vampires. Although noble, Baron, you are too weak to protect Miss Raini\u201d\u201cThe worst is the possibility that Miss Raini will be kidnapped and used.\u201d\u201cIf you let it spill out of the country, you don\u2019t know what kind of trickery you can put on it.\u201dThe problem is piled up even if I count it by the fold.One thing, Miss Raini\u2019s fascinating effect is that mental interference can overthrow the country.Two, if the source of that power was a vampire, the reality of the vampire could be confirmed and Miss Raini could be used as a material for research.Three, it would be very unpleasant if this information did not remain in the country and was known to another country and Miss Raini was taken away.These three alone are going to give me a headache. In fact, there are other problems just raising things that are understandable and critical.\u201cIt\u2019s the most dangerous thing that you can\u2019t control yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Speaking of which, how does the princess take action?\u201cThis is why I suspect Miss Raini is a vampire, but we rebel each other that Demon Stone doesn\u2019t really like the compatibility between demon stones\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, is that why? Engraving, right?\u201cYes, so I realized it was uncomfortable and I was able to resist.\u201dMy engraving is a melting of dragon demon stones to tame my body. As a function, it is no different from the Demon Stone. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m under mental interference from the engraving that should be called a \u201ccurse\u201d. That\u2019s why we realized that there was a rebellion between the demon stones that occurred.True, I don\u2019t know what makes me fortunate in any way. This means that only heretic children like me can resist Miss Raini\u2019s indiscriminate charm.\u201c\u2026 I wonder if I\u2019ll have to take it away when this happens\u201d\u201c\u2026 will it be\u201dFirst of all, you can\u2019t leave it alone. Although it is true that Miss Raini is dangerous, it is not that she had an affair with herself. Besides, she is also an interesting subject. If you examine Miss Raini, you may be able to apply it to my research in the future.I don\u2019t get the impression that Miss Raini is the bad guy because I talked to Miss Raini again. She was just swayed by her own power. Yet you are unreasonably asked to die, your body is deceived, or you are flirted with the thoughts of your country. It\u2019s just such a harsh reality.It doesn\u2019t feel too good to overlook. But protecting Miss Raini has a lot of headache issues rolling around.\u201cAhhh, no. I can\u2019t handle it alone. If I take Miss Raini away, it will be an absolute problem. Al-kun, Al-kun\u2019s surroundings, the Ministry of Magic, they make absolutely loud noises!\u201cYou\u2019ll definitely make a scene\u2026\u201dI feel a headache in one problem after another. There\u2019s absolutely nothing I can do about this. Yeah, if you\u2019re in trouble, even the standing parents can use it!\u201cI\u2019ll honestly talk to your father and your mother. I need to hear from Baron Cyan, about Miss Raini\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cIt could have been a vampire,\u201d he said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I don\u2019t have enough information to decide what I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s not a question of how I can do this on my own in the first place, so the only people I can use are my parents!If you decide on a policy, give Ilia instructions and ask her to summon Father and Mother. Even if the fathers speak to each other in the stomach, we\u2019ll talk to them first. Now we should not have Miss Raini meet an unspecified number of people.I was left in my room with Miss Raini while Ilia went to get my fathers. Miss Raini was shuddering to hold her own body in a hazy manner.\u2026 I can\u2019t even do it. Even I get headaches all the time. Although I am aware that I am out of standard, Miss Raini is an ordinary child. I honestly don\u2019t think I can hold it.Never mind. I hold Miss Raini\u2019s head in my arms. I stroke my back watching Miss Raini react, who made me jump like a surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t make it worse. I promise, because I\u2019m still a princess. It is our duty to protect our country and our people. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t abandon you, Miss Raini.\u201dNo reply from Miss Raini. Just a quiet creaking voice and a hand stretched out to hang on grabbing my dress.Ilia came into the room with her father and mother as she stroked her back to calm Miss Raini down. Though he rounded his eyes for a moment to see how we were doing, he immediately tightened his expression and turned back to me.\u201cAnis, I heard you were in a hurry. What happened? What happened?\u201cFather, please listen to me quietly.\u201dI will tell my father and mother about Miss Raini as easily as possible. About Miss Raini\u2019s charm, about her suspicion of vampires, etc.Father gets the look of bitter worms chewed up easily if he listens, and at the end of the day, he holds his forehead down. My mother also constantly emits sharp signs with a tight look.\u201c\u2026 unbelievable, such a story\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s true. I\u2019m still uncertain about the truth, but I don\u2019t mind clarification later. The question is how to deal with this situation. I think, given her power, it would be best for me to take it\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 if you take Miss Raini, Algardo won\u2019t shut up\u201dMy father tells me to blur with a bitter running voice. It\u2019s really that, Father.\u201cThat\u2019s right, my head hurts the most\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not going to tell Miss Raini widely, and most importantly, I can\u2019t predict what will happen by telling Al Kun the truth, who is expected to be captivated. Yeah, if you\u2019re asking Miss Raini to hide, I\u2019ll work it out, but I disagree. She is also a people of this country.\u201d\u201cI know. But what\u2019s the matter\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve tried saying that if you dispose of Miss Raini far away, it will be resolved, but it seems reassuring that Father hasn\u2019t even considered the option of killing her. This is where the problem starts\u2026\u201c\u2026 anise. You say you\u2019re responsible for the treatment of Miss Raini?\u201cMother? Yeah, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m the right person to deal with this problem.\u201d\u201cThat disorder is Algard, isn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 yeah, well. You will.\u201d\u201cNow let Algardo accompany me and take me on an outing\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201dDoes that mean I\u2019m taking Al-kun outside, Mother?!? I turn my eyes round to Mother\u2019s sudden suggestion.\u201cI can put on as many reasons as I want. If you say I\u2019ll work out again based on this situation, you\u2019ll be able to hold back even if you disagree. Plus that kid needs a track record. That too, Anis, is a feat in line with your magic. If you line up that kid who couldn\u2019t make Uphilia your fianc\u00e9e, there\u2019s only one advantage.\u201d\u201cWow, Al-kun was truncated.\u201dAl\u2019s rating for being a boy is too much. No, I deserve it, but I can\u2019t justify anything to a boulder, Al\u2026\u201cAlgardo, if I do something about it, let the rest of Miss Raini\u2019s captivated sons hold Orphans in responsibly.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s the rest of your job. It\u2019s easy to move if you can\u2019t pick your hands to keep Algardo down, but Sylphine will take you out.\u201dHis father\u2019s reign is brilliant, but he\u2019s not pushing hard enough. I wish I could say a king who honors the good sum, but when I have a mother who is a female jewel at a time like this, the choice expands.You think a power relationship is ideal because your father usually suppresses a mother with that harsh side, or a really good couple. While my parents.\u201cBut it won\u2019t be long before we can keep Algard out. You won\u2019t have to make it prolonged for a reason, but it still is. Do you mind, Anis?\u201d\u201cYes, Mother\u201d\u201cYou should be committed to improving Miss Raini\u2019s health by then. If Miss Raini\u2019s current situation doesn\u2019t improve by the time Algardo returns, it will take me to hide it.\u201d\u201cHey, Mother!?\u201dThat means you\u2019re declaring that you\u2019re going to end it with your own hands!? Your father is giggling, and Ilaria is shaking your shoulders like he was scared for a moment!? If you\u2019re in Miss Raini, your face is going to turn bright blue and you\u2019re going to hide even though you didn\u2019t do anything!?\u201cIf you don\u2019t reject the roots of the disaster, I will be responsible. We cannot all sink into mud, if it is a people to protect if it is to bring disaster to the country. Be prepared then. Miss Raini would be nice, too?I mean it. My mother meant it, this. It\u2019s a serious responsibility\u2026\u2026\u201cSo who will you tell? People choose more than not to reveal everything, don\u2019t they?\u201cMm-hmm. I guess I\u2019ll have to explain to Baron Cyan. Even if I put it under you, I can\u2019t make it public. It would be a good idea to leave the house for the sake of sanitary care and keep it in secret from you.\u201d\u201cChief Sprout Knights said his son was in on the impeachment. He is also an associate. Let\u2019s get him involved, too. You need to pay attention to the Royal Palace security, right? You\u2019ll do something with me and Orphans.\u201dI can\u2019t do the political rush around here, so I\u2019ll just have to leave it to you. My detachment is ideal for pulling cages, and unlimited access for people. It is the royal palace maid who has the possibility to come in and out, but many have a hard mouth. If you\u2019re out of the palace, it\u2019s a good idea to hide Miss Raini.And I looked into Miss Raini to explore measures of her power. I was going to do something new, but it\u2019s not going to be easy because it\u2019s going to be a formal job. I\u2019m just a little bit overwhelmed, but I can\u2019t even cry.\u201cAnis, it\u2019s going to be tough for you too\u2026 but do it right\u201d\u201cOf course. This is the only interesting research subject. I feel responsible, but that\u2019s it! Because this is this!\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s really not what you do.\u201dHa, she sighed at my mother like she was frightened. Was I not able to draw any intentions from that\u2026?\u201cPut Miss Raini in your outhouse and you\u2019ll have a big problem\u201d\u201cProblem?\u201d\u201cWho are you living off the palace with now?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRight, now you have Uffi in the outhouse!?Well, this is official work from the country, and it\u2019s urgent, so if you don\u2019t have a choice, you\u2019re going to have to swallow it, and you\u2019re going to live out of the house with Yufi and Miss Raini?\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the level of awkwardness!?\u201dWhat am I going to do? Ho, how did this really happen?!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20: 20I had my head on my way home from the royal palace, what am I really going to do? No, there\u2019s nothing I can do.I\u2019ll tell you all that on the boulder. I\u2019ll stop Miss Raini from protecting her! I can\u2019t say. It is now certain that Miss Raini will be allowed to live in my outhouse. All I can say is that I have no other choice.Lady Raini also needs to be prepared to come out of the palace, and Baron Cyan also needs an explanation, so it was not until later that Miss Raini came out of the palace. In the meantime, my mother stabbed me with a nail so that I could explain it firmly to Uffi.No, I didn\u2019t forget about Yufi, did I? I was just inadvertently out of my mind because Miss Raini had too many problems on parade. That\u2019s not why I was scorning Yufi, this is like force majeure, this is my duty as a princess or anything.\u201cWhat shall we do\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dMy whining was cut off by Ilia. It is too ruthless a trick. That and all of this. Isn\u2019t that what Al caused, I\u2019m not bad? I\u2019d rather not be your sister. You\u2019re all wiping your ass, don\u2019t you think you can be rewarded?\u201cI want to go butcher Al now\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, are you fighting for the right to inherit the throne?\u201cI don\u2019t need a throne! Oh, yeah! Why are you all this trouble?\u201cIf you don\u2019t stick your neck in it, you can\u2019t solve all the cases without a princess. Or when I realized the country was on the verge of overthrowing, until.\u201d\u201cSucks!I\u2019m disgusted by all the problems I really can handle. I suspect this is a bad year or something, or even started with a bargain sale of disaster. I don\u2019t want you to push it.Anyway, the problem is Ufi. There are places where physical and psychological care was the main reason for keeping Ufi in the outhouse. I can\u2019t believe that even though my life is finally calming down and Yufi is calming down, I have to live with Miss Raini even though there are circumstances\u2026\u201c\u2026 I wonder if you\u2019re okay\u201dI don\u2019t think you need to worry about Master Uphilia.\u201cYes\u2026? \u2018Cause it\u2019s Miss Raini, isn\u2019t it?\u201cDid Miss Raini do something directly to Master Uphilia?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not that narrow-minded. Just don\u2019t worry about him.\u201dI don\u2019t think Yufi\u2019s a bad kid or a narrow heart, but I\u2019m worried about her. There were places where I couldn\u2019t even do it. Ha, it\u2019s a tough future\u2026Slightly depressed, he returned to the outhouse and invited Yufi, who welcomed him, to tell him about what had happened in the royal palace. And tell Miss Raini that she is afraid that she will live in the outhouse.\u201c\u2026 ha, is that right\u201dUffi\u2019s response, which I was terribly waiting for, was really light. A whine that\u2019s more unresponsive than that, like out of your mind. Honestly, I can\u2019t grasp what you think. I get anxious the other way about reactions that just take the facts.\u201cUh. That\u2019s all\u2026?\u201cThat\u2019s all, even if they say\u2026 it\u2019s necessary, right?No, on the contrary, even if you look so strange. Don\u2019t tell me you thought the tipping trick was a little cute.\u201cNo, I am\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s force majeure, isn\u2019t it? If so, I was wondering if I\u2019d think of something.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201c? I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re having so much trouble with.\u201dI was told off with a decent face. Could it have been like this all along, Ufi?\u201cI think Miss Raini is annoying, but if she\u2019s not malicious herself, she doesn\u2019t need to say anything more, and her engagement to Master Algardo has been broken. I don\u2019t think you need to have a pan.\u201d\u201cIs Uffi really good with that?\u201cBecause it\u2019s force majeure. Then I don\u2019t feel like blaming you, and if you blame me, Miss Raini will be hard on you. So nothing in particular comes to mind from me.\u201dUgh, um\u2026 don\u2019t worry about this. Perhaps it is if I say that humans are made, but that they are too humane?\u2026 well, this is one side of Uffi as well. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you think of Miss Raini. But I process it with reason before I think I\u2019m dissatisfied with it. It\u2019s not about holding it in, it\u2019s not about hoarding it. And leave nothing behind.So Yufi was perfect. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019ve seen all the Ufi, so I never felt it, but maybe this is the distortion Ufi holds.\u201cBesides, if Anis abandoned Miss Raini because of me, on the contrary, I despised you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that, but it\u2019s complicated to think that it\u2019s hard for Yuffi to do that, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Please stay, Master Anis. I\u2019m glad you saved me. I don\u2019t want you to pull my leg.\u201dI felt a little complicated about Yuffi\u2019s response.I guess Yufi\u2019s charm of being raised as the next queen and gathering envy from many people is this standing behavior.Fair enough, don\u2019t pinch your emotions there. Disgruntled and angry are gone with strong reason. That could be ideal as a personable person.But at the same time, it\u2019s a drawback. Uffi was too perfect, that\u2019s why he betrayed me. Yufi\u2019s perfection becomes a mirror that reflects the immaturity of others. No wonder someone neglects Uffi like that.I didn\u2019t actually see it, either, and I didn\u2019t want Uffi to stay perfect. That\u2019s not how people live. It becomes a creature called the Queen. A queen should be a way of life.\u201c\u2026 Then we need to make sure that we can all get along even when Miss Raini comes. From now on, we\u2019re living together here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you one of them\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about the difference in identity, although I can speak in an official setting because I would be pissed off if I said anything. If only while you\u2019re here, right? I don\u2019t care where that distracts me. Because if you can\u2019t breathe, the humans will crumble. I want this to be the place for both of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you. Because that word is enough for me.\u201dI think this is a hard time for Yufi and Miss Raini. If I\u2019m the one who can manage that, I\u2019ll do my best. It\u2019s good for me, too.I can\u2019t change the past. I don\u2019t want to make you say the past was pointless, it\u2019s just painful if you can\u2019t turn hard experiences into the happiness you\u2019re about to feel. So at least I want to help them with what I can do.How painful the reality was, it would be nice if everyone smiled. Because I can\u2019t forget the first dream I had on my chest. So this is good, and it finally seemed so.Ready to welcome Miss Raini in the outhouse, Miss Raini came secretly to the outhouse to avoid being enlightened to enter the outhouse, and was terribly restless.I don\u2019t think that would be the case either. Because Miss Raini has Uffi in front of her. We didn\u2019t do anything directly with each other, but we had an affair over our fianc\u00e9e.From Miss Raini\u2019s point of view, her identity will be on top of it, and there will be burdens that she has made decisive in breaking her engagement.Seeing Raini, who is obviously frightened and frightened, Uffi has nothing in particular on his face. Cold, nothing like that. I don\u2019t have any emotions. That\u2019s enough to make this one more harassing.\u201cUm\u2026 well, from today on we\u2019ll be living together in this outhouse, let\u2019s get along!I\u2019ll try to brighten it up by the time it gets rough, but there\u2019s no response from the two of us. Quiet silence hurt me.\u201c\u2026 Miss Raini\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201dIn that I spoke from Ufi to Miss Raini. Miss Raini makes her shoulder jump just enough to see and face Uffi.But words from Uffi don\u2019t last. Staring at Miss Raini with no expression on her face, Miss Raini stared at her as if she were a frog stared at by a snake. It was Yufi who stopped Miss Raini from crying even now.\u201c\u2026 sorry. Well, I don\u2019t know what kind of face it would be appropriate for me to look at a time like this.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cI understand your situation. I thought you might care if I didn\u2019t think anything about it. So should I blame you or forgive you? I figured out how to make it easier for you, but you\u2019re not going to make it\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, no!? Please don\u2019t! Master Uphilia will apologize! It\u2019s all my fault\u2026!Miss Raini, who was turned by Yufi to apologize, shook her neck left and right as she went half frenzied. A high-profile duke\u2019s warrant, and an apology from the person you\u2019ve made will be wolfish, I look at it like any other HR.\u2026 Shall I keep an eye on you for a second?\u201cMiss Raini, are you blaming yourself for being harmful and falling for me and embarrassing me for what I did?\u201cNo! No, no, no! I have no desire to harm Master Uphilia!\u201cThen it would be too unreasonable to incriminate the misfortune you were born with. I don\u2019t think the situation is so bad right now. You have a situation, too, and I came here because I needed help. Then I can\u2019t even encourage you to take that hand and play it.\u201dYufi takes Miss Raini\u2019s hand and faces it from the front. Yufi stares at Miss Raini with a soft look compared to earlier. Miss Raini, whose hand was taken, is in suspicion of behavior without knowing what to do.Uffi doesn\u2019t say anything more either. Although Miss Raini manages to put something into words, she lays her forehead on Yuffi\u2019s hand to weep and blur without being able to speak.\u201cSorry, do\u2026\u2026! Make Master Uphilia\u2019s life a mess\u2026\u2026!\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all bad. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t say with myself, who was the next queen, that an individual named Uphilia Magenta lives quite happily now. So you can have fun living the rest of your life.\u201dForgive and admit. How difficult is that? Yufi who can do that is still awesome, but I feel it somewhere far away. But if you say this is the strength of Uffi, I don\u2019t want to turn my back either. Some things are called older intentions.I\u2019m sure what Miss Raini needed was a word from Uffi above all. I think when I look at Miss Raini clutching to Yufi\u2019s hand, crying like a groan without words.Know the facts you don\u2019t know, and be frightened of the impending reality. Even though I said force majeure, I guess I was frightened of that sin as to how to atone for the future I had broken. I think that\u2019s a natural story.The apology ends in self-satisfaction if you don\u2019t accept it. So Yufi forgave, and Miss Raini was forgiven. It\u2019s a pleasure. Please, I hope the tears Miss Raini shed are from joy. Because it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201c\u2026 I showed you my embarrassment\u201dMiss Raini rubs her reddish eyes as she snorts. But the expression was refreshing.Once again we sit in a chair and surround the table. Soon the tea that Ilia brewed for me was served, so I moisten my throat with that tea. Yeah, it\u2019s the usual delicious Ilarian tea.\u201cIt rains and hardens the ground, I guess.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis?\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Why don\u2019t we take a breath first and then we\u2019ll talk about the future. There\u2019s so much we have to do! First, Miss Raini. If you put it on, lady, it\u2019s a distance, so I\u2019ll call you Raini, okay?\u201cYes!\u201cThanks. Well, let\u2019s sort out the issues surrounding Raini first\u201dBoth Yufi and Raini squeeze their faces into the cut-out of my topic. I suppose Ilia, who is holding back behind me, is squeezing her face as well, I suppose.There are many problems surrounding Raini, all of which are often troublesome.One, that she has demonic stones in her body, enchantment, psychic interference powers.Two, that the power of its charm captivated even the royal family, and that I just happened to be able to resist.Three, you don\u2019t know how to use it if you know about its powers.Four, based on that, Raini has no back shield, and he is weak in order to protect himself.Five, when it comes to trying to protect Raini, I\u2019m the one in charge but I have Al Kun\u2019s problem.Six, if Raini\u2019s identity is the half of a vampire, it will prove that the vampire is real.Seven, no matter who you are, if you don\u2019t control your powers, your mother has declared herself to end Raini.All the fine problems still exist, and this is all they can be mentioned in the big places. Raini, who checked again, has also dropped his shoulder.\u201cHow\u2019s Uffi? I knew you had a thing for Raini?\u201c\u2026 right. You can\u2019t deny it. However, I didn\u2019t have anything more personal to do with my emotions than I used to, so I don\u2019t think I would have reflected it in my actions even if I had a preference. At best, the thought of advising you on how to stand and behave is probably the proof that you\u2019ve been affected.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. Emotions and reason are different. Whatever your feelings were, they didn\u2019t make you feel uncomfortable being the next queen.\u201dWhat spiritual power, or iron wall reason? Pull me on a little boulder, too. That means it\u2019s too perfect for boulders to be neglected, Uffi\u2026\u201cSo Master Uphilia embarrassed me\u2026 do you say that Master Uphilia was unusual because, as long as we dated, everyone went crazy and even the people who made it better in the beginning changed leopards\u2026\u201dRaini smiled with a crisp, whimpering smile that didn\u2019t make her feel anything. It\u2019s another look that makes you feel different from Yuffi\u2019s faceless expression.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIt always is. Even when we get along, when people make a difference, we all change our attitudes. So whoever we get along with, we just have to keep our distance apart\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s difficult\u201dAt first I am dissatisfied with Raini trying to get a distance, even if it is favorable, because it is favorable. In that case, the favorable emotions that swelled up with charm may be inverted. Because love and hate are the emotions of the whole thing. If you can\u2019t control it, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s very troublesome.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why my family took care of me. My mother-in-law can\u2019t help but be neglected without this power.\u201dRaini\u2019s grin whining in self-derision seems painful. The people who turned their thoughts to me that they liked may have just been driving their minds crazy with their alien abilities. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t go around and leave with that suspicion.\u201cSo to be honest, I\u2019m a little ho away from home\u2026\u2026 if I doubt it, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll change my distance. Then those people might neglect me, too. Even though I take that for granted, I\u2019m really scared\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. You can count on me as much as you like. Raini is going to help me with my research. That should help control Raini\u2019s power, too.\u201dIn fact, I\u2019m like before, and I adjusted the engraving to my body, but Raini was born with it. Then I think it\u2019s easier to put that power into things than I do.\u201cIs there anything I can do to help? Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cAlthough Uffi can\u2019t resist charm, I hope he keeps an objective view of Raini because he can maintain a flat relationship even if he can\u2019t resist. You can\u2019t do all this in Ilia, can you?\u201c\u2026 right. I feel immature.\u201dIlia, who had refrained behind him, says with regret. Ilia has a lot of emotional swings. For that matter, I want Raini in person. All this will be a joy to raise your hands to say that it is good to have Uffi. Role sharing is important.\u201cThen I\u2019d like to check things out and go, is Raini good at magic?\u201cNo, magic isn\u2019t that far\u2026 I\u2019ve been told for a long time that magic is a lot.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it completely unusable?\u201cYes. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019m good at it. Should I say that my senses are blurry\u2026 I\u2019ve been handled before, but it doesn\u2019t match what you say.\u201dHmm, I see. There is one reason for that feeling, I know it.\u201cMaybe it was the demon stone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is it a demon stone?\u201cThe Demon Stone is what the Spirit Stone has degenerated. I mean, even if certain magic has stretch bills, I guess it\u2019s less apt for other magic. Yeah, it\u2019s reasoning, so there\u2019s something wrong. I hope you don\u2019t get caught up there and be flexible about things.\u201dSimply because the possibility of inappropriateness has not yet been abandoned. When this happens, I guess the immediate goal is to explore the nature of Raini\u2019s demonic stones.\u201cIs Raini good at manipulating magic?\u201c\u2026 is it an operation of magic? I think it\u2019s probably bad. As I was saying, I\u2019m bad at using magic\u2026\u201d\u201cUh, no, no. Magic manipulation and magical ingenuity don\u2019t mean the same thing.\u201d\u201cIs it not?Uffi also raised his doubts with a decent eye. Oh, well. Have you ever explained that?\u201cRaini may be surprised because this is the first time he\u2019s heard about it, but magic is only about giving magic to the Spirit and turning it into magic, and affinity with the Spirit is a different technique than magic manipulation, even if it\u2019s required. It\u2019s not the same talent that\u2019s masterful of words and clever of hands, is it?\u201c\u2026 is the magic operation an affinity with the Spirit, how precise can you release the magic you want to shape, and is there no doubt in the realization that the magic operation is different with the technology involved in magic itself?\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cSo what is magic manipulation?\u201cFeel the magic and let it flow. You\u2019ve done that before, haven\u2019t you? Spirit Stone Magic. If you say so, you can use it to measure magic operations.\u201dIt\u2019s ironic, but if you can use magic, it\u2019s something anyone can do for granted. Magic manipulation is. Though I used a little special method until I got it.\u201cWhat happens when you poorly manipulate magic? You have to plunge into the wall.\u201d\u201cOr on the wall\u2026?\u201cOh, it\u2019s a case of putting too much magic into those massive windy spiritual stones and plunging them into the wall,\u201d\u201cOne of the causes of defeat was the high number. I can\u2019t deny it when I say that the same goes for all body burns in the bath\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there also an indoor flood?\u201cI guess the only thing that worked was plowing the soil instantly\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you were going to plow in the fields on the Royal Castle property.\u201dYeah, I miss it. In other words, I can\u2019t use magic, so I don\u2019t manipulate magic on a daily basis. When I tried to put magic into spiritual stones, I tried my best to do more than I expected. I mean, the more the dot touched, the poorer the magic manipulation was.There\u2019s got to be something besides me! I\u2019ve been outraged, but people like me use it rarely in the first place, and it\u2019s usually the wizard\u2019s job to put magic into spiritual stones. They can use magic, so they already understand additions and subtractions on their skin.In conclusion, the result was revealed that I had just kept on treading bravely, but that would be a different story.\u201cBy the way, magic manipulation is an essential technique for dealing with inventions of magic. Because unlike magic, there\u2019s a proper cap.\u201d\u201cYou think there\u2019s no cap on magic?\u201cThe Spirit is the natural manifestation of all things. I can do anything if the world is in a range that\u2019s not impossible, in theory. If we want to have a natural mutation in the boulder, we can talk about how much magic and affinity we need with the Spirit.\u201d\u201cI was wondering if I was going to magically have a natural mutation\u2026\u201dThe idea was strange, and the three of them saw it with their eyes. \u2018Cause if you can, why don\u2019t you just check the means? It would be nice if we didn\u2019t do it. And I wonder if that\u2019s all dreams can be spread by talking about being able to scale it down.Anyway, let\u2019s get back to it. Now it\u2019s time for Raini to gain control over the power of the Demon Stone.\u201cThe Demon Stone has different uses than the Spirit Stone, but the reason is the same, you just have to instill magic. Raini has never consciously activated the Demon Stone, so it\u2019s possible he\u2019s drooling. I mean, it\u2019s funny\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess, Miss Raini\u2019s about to cry, so that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kohon. I mean, maybe the force is leaking unconsciously. But with control, you might be able to control it. The first thing Raini does is once again acquire control of magic and be able to manipulate demonic stones\u2026. and one more thing. I\u2019ll present this as a means first.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t want to use this hand. Because there is less chance of success. But it\u2019s a possibility, so I\u2019ll have to say it. It\u2019s a last resort.\u201cI\u2019ve made you aware of controlling this far, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no other way. It\u2019s just risky. Live or die.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is the way?\u201cDeciding the Demon Stone out of Raini\u201dRaini blued his face at once, and Yufi glanced at me, too.I know, about what I\u2019m talking about. That\u2019s practically the same as saying I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201cSure enough, if you leave it as it is decided, Raini dies. So remove the cause in the first place while simultaneously removing the demon stone and treating\u201d\u201c\u2026 is it possible?\u201cI think 80% will fail. First, there can be shock death from pain. Blood loss in the process of sweeping out demon stones can also be possible. If we lose the Demon Stone in the first place, we can\u2019t guarantee that Raini might be able to live. Safely connecting your life may leave you with sequelae. It\u2019s definitely a last resort.\u201dTechniques such as surgical surgery have not yet developed in this world. Because it\u2019s a world protected by the grace of magic. If you use magic, your injuries will heal, and your illness will get better. In that sense, it may be said that medical technology in this world has developed differently from previous lives.So what I\u2019m thinking is heresy is heresy, even if it\u2019s repellent. Besides, I don\u2019t have the knowledge or experience to actually perform surgery. It\u2019s only a matter of revalidating the knowledge of memories and comparing it with the common sense of the world.\u201cMy mother said that if there was nothing I could do, I would end it with my own hands. But I\u2019ll face Raini\u2019s life to the end, and I\u2019ve decided to be responsible. If I really can\u2019t do anything by running out of means, I\u2019ll take the last resort\u201d\u201c\u2026 Princess Anisphere\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not because I want to give up. In order not to give up, I will take responsibility until the end. So I hope Raini doesn\u2019t give up either. Your power is certainly dangerous, and you may not be allowed to live without control. But that\u2019s not sad.\u201dMagic is a power that can make someone smile. That\u2019s the dream story, no matter how far away the ideal is.I\u2019ll never give up. I decided to keep reaching out if I could.\u201cBelieve me, will you follow me, Raini? I want to show value in your power.\u201dNo reply. But seeing Raini snort again and again, I loosened my cheeks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21: 21I was stuck thinking in my own workshop. Today we will investigate Raini\u2019s demonic stones and explore ways to control his power. On top of that, I had concerns. But I didn\u2019t say that to anyone.(Raini can remain human when control is achieved by instilling magic into the Demon Stone\u2026?Even though I thought about the possibility, I didn\u2019t say it because I couldn\u2019t yet make a decision.Vampires are demons changed from wizards. And a vampire is half dead. When you awaken the power of the Demon Stone, it\u2019s impossible that your body will suddenly become half decayed. After a long examination, Raini remains a legitimate human being.\u201cWhen you get the art of controlling demon stones, it\u2019s unknown if you can just stay human,\u201dI don\u2019t know if a vampire can remit a child. Maybe there\u2019s an individual difference, or maybe Raini really had a miracle-like chance of God receiving raw.It is unknown what changes will happen to Raini when he puts the power of the Demon Stone under control. I can only make speculation because there is no precedent. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t say it. I can\u2019t believe you could be a monster if you help.\u201cI hope you roll in the right direction\u201dI wish there was nothing. It would be ideal if it would at least fit to the point of being attacked by a blood-sucking urge. Even though I know of the existence of a vampire, it is riddled to the ecology. That\u2019s enough to add a variety of dorsal fin tail fins to your story.I can\u2019t help but worry. The clock needle never stops, because we can only do what we can little by little.Never mind. I leave the workshop. I only came here to get the tools I needed in the first place. If we left for the courtyard as soon as possible, Yufi and Raini and Ilia would be waiting there.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting! Then let\u2019s start practicing control of Raini\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you\u201dRaini nods with a tight look. Until the other day, Raini lacked the hegemony to say some pretty girl of dim fortune, but now I feel full of motivation. Nod that what you are willing to do is a good thing.Well, it\u2019s Mana Blade who gives it to Raini like that. This dish boasts some of the finest craftsmanship and stability in the Demonic Props. Let\u2019s get used to this first.\u201cThis is the magic item I made called Mana Blade. Even magic has magic to make magic blades, right?\u201cYes, did you make this by touching it?\u201cYes. So, the use of this instills the necessary magic\u2026\u201dSet up Mana Blade after a short distance. Raini sends an interesting gaze at the blade, which is constituted by magic. Next to it, Yufi was letting his cheeks loosen as he nodded at Raini\u2019s reaction that he was too.\u201cThen why don\u2019t we use Raini?\u201d\u201cYes. Inject magic\u2026 with doing it magically\u2026 just like\u2026\u201dWhimpering the steps several times, Raini pours his magic on Mana Blade. Yeah, it feels like I saw it. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem with the flow of magic. I don\u2019t feel weird, and I don\u2019t see any abnormalities.And lightly Mana Blade was producing a blade of magic. Raini is seriously observing Mana Blade and trying to shake it gently.\u201cWow, this is amazing. It\u2019s easier than just making magic! I wonder if I prefer this one. I\u2019ve never used a sword or anything\u2026\u201d\u201cI prefer magic because it\u2019s wider, but I guess this is better for those who aren\u2019t good at magic.\u201d\u201cUm, compared to Master Uphilia, yeah, a little\u2026 on a boulder\u201dRaini is smiling bitterly at Ufilia\u2019s words. That\u2019s right, you\u2019re the head of a genius child. Yufi is. Because it is the privilege of those who can do better freely on their own.Now, while Raini\u2019s magic flow is fine, shall we keep doing some check-ups?\u201cRaini, I wonder if you could intervene a few times to get in and out of the blade. Because I\u2019m a little curious about how Demon Stone reacts.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026. Speaking of which, where is Demon Stone in your body?That, I didn\u2019t tell you. I point my chest at Raini tilting his neck. It was the heart that pointed it out.\u201cHere. I think it\u2019s stuck with the heart\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the heart. Um, if I remove that, I won\u2019t die instantly\u2026\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a last resort, so let\u2019s hope there isn\u2019t one.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like being ripped out of my chest and dying\u2026\u2026!Oh, I think I\u2019m overmotivated in a strange place. Well, whatever the history, it\u2019s desirable to be motivated.Then excuse me. I turn around behind Raini and hug Raini so he can keep his back. Put those hands firmly on your chest\u2026\u2026 yeah, I guess they\u2019re bigger than me. No, this could be pretty big\u2026?\u201cOh, oh, that!? Princess Anisphere!? Why are you rubbing your chest!?\u201d\u201cTo see the demon stone react. No, but you have quite a few things\u2026\u201d\u201cHih.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dBlunt pain ran on my head with the dull sound. I\u2019m about to scream as it is, but I can handle it because I\u2019m holding Raini tight. Ilia, add or subtract a little more and hit me!? If I hit you, I\u2019ll make that noise!?Maybe next time I\u2019ll make some Harrison for Ilia and give it to her. If I get beat up badly, the boulder will tear me down, too. It still doesn\u2019t hurt if you get slapped on that one, and the Ilia you\u2019re slapping might drop your drinks. Let\u2019s consider it.\u201cWell, then, Raini, try it\u201d\u201cYes, no\u2026\u201dWhile blushing, Raini repeats Mana Blade\u2019s activation. I\u2019ll explore the magic flow to the Demon Stone, but the Demon Stone still doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s flowing.But it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any magic in the Stone. By analogy, as there is a circuit through which magic passes, it feels that although it is connected to the circuit, magic is not actively flowing.Still, there are demonic stones in the flowing path, and they receive magic. But I\u2019m not actively trying to harness magic. Should this state be referred to as an inactivated state?\u201cHmm, I see. That\u2019s enough. Thanks.\u201d\u201c\u2026 this is an examination, this is an examination, because this is an examination\u2026\u201dWhen I let Miss Raini go, she held her chest tight and was distanced. He said he had no other intention. But it worked, hehe.When I thought about it, I saw Yufi with no expression. I can\u2019t see the color of that emotion. It\u2019s like my eyes are complaining about something, cough it up and then get back on my mind. Come on, let\u2019s be serious!\u201cI guess I know more or less the state of Raini\u2019s demonic stones! There seems to be no problem with the magic manipulation, so let\u2019s move on to the next phase!\u2026 and I just wanted to say. Wouldn\u2019t you like to go?\u201d\u201c\u2026 is there something?\u201cSpeaking of which, there is. Yeah, you\u2019re right. So let\u2019s talk about it.\u201dIt\u2019s going to be a little long, so I encourage you to move to the tea party space in the courtyard. Ilia is the only one who is away and ready for tea.Wait for Ilia\u2019s tea to make it, and moisten her throat with that tea. I regain my mind and look over everyone again.\u201cThere was no problem manipulating Raini\u2019s magic, and the Demon Stone is in an inactivated state. I know it\u2019s like a drooling state because it\u2019s moving with minimal force but I haven\u2019t even operated it. Well, then, we\u2019re gonna talk about controlling this. I need you to be ready before I do.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ready, is it?Raini frowns anxiously. And I nod and answer.\u201cWhen you activate the Demon Stone, a change can happen to the flesh. It could affect your spirit, and if you put it simply, it\u2019s not like you could really be a vampire.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you mean I won\u2019t be able to be me?\u201cIt may or may not be. I couldn\u2019t say anything until I knew it clearly. I didn\u2019t want you to get me wrong. Sorry about this, Raini.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no\u201dRaini shakes her neck left and right with a sunken look. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m depressed, but I can\u2019t stop talking here, so I\u2019ll keep going.\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to look so anxious. At least because there\u2019s a precedent for pimping.\u201d\u201cPrecedents?\u201dIt\u2019s about me.Yufi looked at me with a slight change of complexion to Raini, who leaned her neck. As if to ask for an explanation of what it means.I just didn\u2019t say it because I didn\u2019t think it was enough to say it. I\u2019ll explain it properly when I get a chance. Because it\u2019s about that extent.\u201cI am engraving my body with demonic stones. I mean, it\u2019s pretty much the same as having a demon stone in it.\u201d\u201cReally?!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you next time. Um, so. Maybe there\u2019s nothing wrong with using the power of Demon Stone. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m crushing it and turning it into paint, so Raini and I have a different premise. I guess Raini\u2019s body turns into that of a vampire because I\u2019m under similar influence.\u201d\u201c\u2026 does that mean that Master Anis could also become a demon?Uffi asks with a slightly more sharp voice color. I snort firmly, without denying it.\u201cBecause it\u2019s like a curse. In the first place, I was a little cursed by dragons before I carved demon stones into my body.\u201d\u201cDragon!?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Isn\u2019t that amazing? But you can stay like this, so you don\u2019t really care about Raini either, do you? I can handle it!\u2026 That\u2019s what we talked about. It\u2019s no big deal to say curse. But because you killed yourself, you were cursed whether you were stronger than yourself or a dragon.\u201dDragon exorcism made possible by giving everything you can have. Finally, the dragon put such a curse on me before I could breathe out. The loser is deprived of everything, versus the winner gets everything. Then you\u2019ll be the next dragon.And since engraving was engraved on my body, I have become subject to interference from engraving. Power, strength, closer to the dragon, as I say. Well, it\u2019s not that annoying if you don\u2019t shed magic either.Still more susceptible to engraving when it is used. Becoming belligerent or feeling a little daunted. I\u2019m just aware of it and I\u2019m not going to be drunk by it. That\u2019s the only thing and I\u2019m breaking it off. It\u2019s not inconvenient.\u201cFor that reason, being cursed isn\u2019t harmful because you\u2019re familiar with your body. If you\u2019re careful, there\u2019s no inconvenience in living normally. Still, they won\u2019t look good if they find out.\u201dLike Uffi there, or Ilia, who\u2019s creating some awesome signs back there. No, I\u2019m thankful you\u2019re worried, because there\u2019s no problem! I want you to forgive me with the results ohrai, truthfully.\u201cIn Miss Raini\u2019s case, unlike mine, it\u2019s from the Demon Stone itself. I want you to keep in mind that blood sucking impulses and all those vampire traits can come out of your body.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cSo instead of directly controlling the Demon Stone, we might be able to explore ways to seal it up somehow, but it\u2019s going to take a while. Above all, that could put a load on your body. It\u2019s not natural for the body.\u201dBecause it is natural to have demon stones, making demon stones completely dysfunctional may have some effect on Raini. In the end, no matter what you do, there is a risk, and later you get to the point of what you want to do in person.\u201c\u2026 wasn\u2019t Princess Anisphere afraid?\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be human.\u201d\u201cNo, nothing\u2026?\u201cThat\u2019s light!?\u201dI have returned nothing in particular to Raini, who has asked me with a serious face. No, apart from saying if you actually think anything of it there?\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of human definition.\u201d\u201cDefinition issues?\u201cI think that\u2019s why I have it. I\u2019m not quitting being a human being to be like a dragon. I can\u2019t say enough to a boulder when that figure is no longer human. Still, I\u2019m the one who chose that. Then I insist on being human while I\u2019m still here, and I don\u2019t care who told me.\u201dKeep who you want to be. That\u2019s why I thought I was disqualified as a royalty, and I don\u2019t think nobility is the right way to live. Because I want to do what I want, admire what I want to be, and live free.Because there\u2019s magic. I was not free to use that magic. I\u2019m still looking for a technique to use. It\u2019s made and produced. That\u2019s the essence of me that I can\u2019t change for the rest of my life. So I won\u2019t give it to anyone, and I don\u2019t want to. So much so that I think I can do anything for it.That\u2019s not why I want to actively throw away what I was born with. Because it\u2019s still a matter of priority.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in humans, too. Some Uffi like a chunk of talent, Ilia who looks heartless and is actually thick in emotion, Raini who may have happened to be born as a demonic half. And I\u2019m just a shapebreaker who loves magic. Even though humans are so different, there\u2019s no way we can narrow down the definition of human being to one.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s a great theory\u201d\u201cIf you want to be human, you just keep saying you\u2019re human. I treat you as a human being within acceptable limits, and most importantly, you said I would take care of you when it comes to Raini. I don\u2019t care if you become a vampire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really lame, Princess Anisphere.\u201dRaini laughs like she\u2019s in trouble. But I don\u2019t see the sad colors that floated until earlier.\u201cLooking at Princess Anisphere makes you look silly to be worried about\u201d\u201cWith all due respect, if you become like a princess, you lose some of your common sense as a person, so be careful.\u201d\u201cYou disparage me very naturally, don\u2019t you, Ilia?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201dI\u2019m not denying it.Who did you laugh out of? Everyone was laughing when they realized it.Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no more pressure to stop being human. I know that it\u2019s not like I can call something unacceptable to human society human.Still, I can\u2019t be anything but me. Everyone should be. So if you\u2019re going to be what you want to be and still insist you\u2019re human, you just need to put your chest up. I\u2019m the one who chooses.\u201cHey, Raini\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?So it\u2019s easy to ask. I just asked him to confirm.Raini lays her eyes down once. There was definite power in his eyes that opened again.\u201cI, I want to take my power\u2026 Because it\u2019s the power I\u2019ve always been with.\u201d\u201cOh well.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThen I\u2019ll just help. If that\u2019s what she wants.\u201cWhen using magic, keep the feeling of instilling magic around your body. I want you to feel your magic flow in your body first.\u201dFollow my instructions and Raini will focus his consciousness. He closes his eyes and carefully imagines the feeling I say as he takes many deep breaths.To make it easier, check the condition while placing your hand on Raini\u2019s shoulder sitting in the chair. To instantly understand Reini\u2019s magic manipulation and the state of the Demon Stone. So far, there seemed to be no problem.I take my gaze off a little and look at Uffi and Ilia watching away, making them nod to reassure me. So far, no problem.\u201c\u2026 somehow, I think I can grab it\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, gather some magic in your heart and see. Something uncomfortable?\u201c\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m being stopped by weirs, clogged. But it\u2019s like solving it with magic\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t forget that feeling. Because that\u2019s what it feels like to instill magic in demonic stones. You can take your time. Don\u2019t rush.\u201dA glimmer of sweat falls from Raini\u2019s forehead. Remove the handkerchief and wipe it.I wonder how much time has passed. I sense Raini\u2019s change from the hand I had on my shoulder. The magic that had been gathered in Raini\u2019s heart was beginning to travel all over his body again.\u201cRaini? Are you okay?I look around to the front and peek into Raini\u2019s face. Raini, whose eyes were closed, slowly opens his eyes.Red. First the color got to my eyes. The suspicious light is blurring in the iris of the back of the eye. Keep carefully observing the changes you see and see.\u201c\u2026 Princess Anisphere\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s me, what do you say? Do you have any unusual feelings about yourself?\u201c\u2026 my body is hot. Looks like I got a fever\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. Shall we release the magic then? Don\u2019t let it out all at once, take your time.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dEncourage Raini to release his magic by holding hands to calm him down. Close your eyes again and slowly release your magic as Raini exhales.You\u2019ve calmed down, Raini opens his eyes again. Though it is the suspicious light that has disappeared, the colour of the iris has been stained with red colour. What kind of change is this?\u201cEye color, you\u2019ve changed\u2026 can I see it for a second?\u201cHuh? Really?Peek into Raini\u2019s eyes with a change of color. If you pay close attention, you still have a pale residue of magic in your eyes. Is this\u2026 like my engraving? I get the impression that some kind of magic is burning.\u201cAny change in vision?\u201c\u2026 no, especially. I\u2019m just uncomfortable with my eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat discomfort?\u201cSounds like a good street of magic can do it if you put some magic through your eyes\u2026\u2026 can you do it again?\u201cFine, take a look at me.\u201dRaini nods at my instructions and starts putting magic into his eyes again. Raini\u2019s eyes are shaking with suspicious light floating again.Within sight of the light, you are struck by the feeling that your spine is twisted. They took the magic even though the engraving on my back wasn\u2019t even activated. Surprised by the sudden sensation, it seemed to go on when I was eyeing Raini, so I strayed from my gaze.\u201cDid you do something to me? Raini.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Wow, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just\u2026 your eyes are taking magic with them, like they\u2019re using magic.\u201d\u201cDevil\u2019s Eye\u2026 or something? Though mental interference is a possible possibility. Is there anything else uncomfortable?\u201cMy whole body, it\u2019s still hot, but my eyes and heart are especially. There\u2019s more\u2026 ah\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cMouth\u2026\u2026 no, teeth, is it? Something mushy\u2026\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Raini, uh.\u201dIf I let Raini open his mouth, I could just see the dog tooth area getting sharper. This is a picturesque change\u2026\u201cYour teeth are fangs\u2026\u201d\u201cHo, ho, ho, ho? Oh, heh heh heh heh heh heh.\u201d\u201cSorry, you can keep your mouth shut. What?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Looks like I\u2019ll be back if I don\u2019t put some magic into it. Here.\u201dHold your mouth before Raini opens his mouth. I couldn\u2019t see the canine teeth I had earlier there. Hmm? Temporary physical changes due to magic? Interesting, this is interesting!I don\u2019t know how the hell it works, I\u2019m curious. Changes due to demonic stones, that\u2019s too unknown. I was concerned about that. I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t go back when I\u2019m like a vampire.\u201cThis\u2026 is worth looking into. Hehe, that\u2019s very interesting, Raini\u2026\u2026!\u201cHino!? Yu, Master Uphilia! Dear Ilia! I am afraid of Princess Anisphere\u2019s eyes!!\u201d\u201cHey, any other changes!? What kind of things are you going to be able to do!? Tell your sister\u2026!! Quick! Look, come on! Ha-ya-ya-ya-ku!!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until after eating the full body blow of Ilia that I realized that I accidentally got tense and scared Raini away that I was stuffy. I think there\u2019s something more about how to stop it!?Refresh your mind and check on Raini. Is there a change in the state of the demonic stone or is there no change in the whole body? Of course, with Uffi and Ilia under surveillance. I mean, I\u2019m so scared of Ilia. Yes, yes, I\u2019ll take a serious look.\u201c\u2026 Huh? This is interesting inside. No, that\u2019s really interesting. I see, this is the kind of approach you\u2019re going to take\u2026\u2026 no, I honestly admire this. But if this is a natural occurrence\u2026\u2026 no, wow, I could say this is a great discovery of the century!!\u201d\u201cUm, Princess Anisphere, there\u2019s another tension\u2026!\u201cHa\u2026\u2026! Sorry, I\u2019m so excited. No, if this is what I\u2019m guessing it is, I\u2019m going to tremble at how talented the wizard who became the prototype of the vampire was\u2026! Ugh, yeah, yeah! I wanted to see something like this!! Oh how happy!! I\u2019m so grateful! What a great day!!\u201dIf I look it up, my skin will poppy as much as I look into it. This is for joy. I understand more or less by looking into it. This is a hell of a mechanism. Though different from mine, that\u2019s why it\u2019s funny!\u201cDon\u2019t just convince yourself. Can you explain?\u201cOf course! You listened very carefully, Ilia! Let\u2019s start with the conclusion! First I found out that a demon named Vampire is real, but not real!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?I can see you\u2019re questioning me. \u2018Cause this isn\u2019t such an existing idea. It\u2019s very similar to me, but it\u2019s like a nearby, distant brotherhood born because things are different from me!\u201cThe very identity of a demon named Vampire is a\u201c magic system \u201dcalled Vampire!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: 22\u201cIt is highly likely that those called vampires will survive to modern times. In the first place, I thought a demon named Vampire had changed from person to person. That must be right and wrong at the same time. To be precise, I think we should refer to vampires as\u201d heirs to a magical system with the ability to be called vampires. \u201cWhat happened to the vampire began with the wizard\u2019s footscratch and challenge that enlightened the time of death.It was magic to keep one\u2019s body alive, even by taking it away from others.\u201cFor example, stealing food from others via blood, mental interference to keep them from feeling uncomfortable.\u201dThis is thought to be to gather allies or inherit magic technology to make compatriots.Many will want eternal life and youth because they will even transcend their life expectancy at any rate. Whatever heterogeneity it was and the lack of ethics.It is not hard to imagine that some would have wanted to disciple, and many would have liked to keep it in the magical grace.Maybe that\u2019s why vampires were tailored to demons. It\u2019s actually too much to banish from the public as a heretic. Because it\u2019s natural to be excluded at the point of harming people.But there\u2019s the wizard of obsession who also tried to transcend death. Were you taking measures, or were you driven by necessity to optimize, evolve? There is no reason to know which motive is ahead, but they have redesigned their existence to be called vampires.\u201cThat aggregation is the Demon Stone. Maybe this was rooted as an organ for the inheritance of the magic system. To acquire the necessary abilities as a vampire. And as it grows, so does the Demon Stone. And now the demon stone will be inherited to the next generation.\u201dSo vampires increase their compatriots. Does that give birth to a child just like a person, or does it let it be inherited by bites spoken of like inheritance?I can\u2019t confirm the answer, but I can make predictions. Because vampires are close to people. Perhaps we should call it a new species from mankind.\u201cI don\u2019t think Raini ever felt a vampire urge before because he didn\u2019t need his body. Because the demon stone was inactivated. I guess it\u2019s more natural to think of Raini as a vampire, or vampire child, innate than to think of him as an acquired vampire.\u201d\u201cSo you think the Demon Stone will use its power if necessary?\u201cIf I had recognized myself as a vampire from the beginning and wanted to use my powers with magic on demonic stones, I might have needed nature and my body. Perhaps ordinary humans don\u2019t have enough magic to use the power of Demon Stone to fuel them. So I naturally recall the art of taking it away from others. I think it\u2019s like an engraved instinct.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but I can\u2019t believe I wanted to interfere\u2026\u201dRaini, who has no idea, shakes his neck left or right. When I saw it, I stood my finger up.\u201cI have a hypothesis about that. Raini had a reason to interfere.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cRaini, I ask you frankly, when was the happiest time of your life?Raini gives a bewildered look to my question. After a little worrying, Raini tells her in a slightly painful voice.\u201c\u2026 when your mother was alive\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about the stepmother in Baron Cyan\u2019s house today, it\u2019s about the mother who gave birth to you, right?\u201cYes, I think I was happiest back then\u201d\u201cSo what makes you think I was happy afterwards?\u201c\u2026 no\u201dI have to live with the loss of my mother. The real father who appeared at that time, and his life as an aristocratic courtier, began, his whole life up to the College of Aristocrats. What did Raini think? However, as far as her reaction is concerned, it is hard to say that she was happy.One day a girl who originally spent time as a civilian has to live as a nobleman. He is slammed into education, restricted in freedom, and required to behave like an aristocrat. I admire the brilliant life of nobility, and I wouldn\u2019t say that no one would be happy, but I wasn\u2019t happy for Raini.\u201cYeah. So Raini was under a lot of stress. I think that\u2019s why I unconsciously wanted mental interference. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the function of a vampire\u2019s demon stone is already instinct. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve begun to show strength apart from my own will.\u201d\u201cI was stressed, is that why?\u201cIf you\u2019re stressed, your body resists. It\u2019s a kind of defensive reaction because you feel tired and your body doesn\u2019t want to move. In other words, we can assume that Raini\u2019s mental interference was an unconscious instinct for self-defence. I began to use charm unconsciously so that people wouldn\u2019t hate me and treat me gently. But that\u2019s an uncontrolled force. It\u2019s easy to charm once, but the control from it stays thrown. It\u2019s no wonder the emotions are disturbing and the charm is counterproductive\u201dNodded as Yufi and Ilia were convinced by my explanation. I mean, Raini\u2019s situation is utter force majeure and it\u2019s hard to hold him accountable. If I\u2019m going to be guilty of that, I\u2019m going to have to ask because I was born. That is unconvincing.Raini\u2019s confusion about someone is also only the result of her instincts working to survive. The problem is that no one knew. Ignorance is why I can\u2019t deal with it. No one thought the existence of a vampire existed, etc., and the reality was unknown.\u201cI think it\u2019s because of Uffi\u2019s thoughts and values that it\u2019s hard to attract to Uffi or that it didn\u2019t seem to work\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 sure if you ask me\u201dBecause it sounds like you\u2019re gonna be flat when your emotions cross a certain level, Yufi. It\u2019s already a habit, or a stained one. Make sure that any emotions unnecessary to act as queen are immediately truncated.That\u2019s why Yufi can\u2019t shake even if he feels fond of Raini. I try to play my part entirely because I don\u2019t shake. That\u2019s\u2026 somehow, totally bad eating with the surroundings. Not everyone has as much self-control as Uffi.\u201cI guess Uffi was kicked around because Uffi\u2019s self-control and Raini\u2019s mental interference had too much impact on his surroundings. It\u2019s the worst combination of bad but deadly for both of us in college with kids still immature, right?\u201c\u2026 right\u201dYufi started to look so far away, and even to Raini, he covered his face with both hands. Ilaria\u2019s got a look on her face that she can\u2019t pick a word for.There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. It\u2019s force majeure, but I just have to laugh early. I don\u2019t think there was a lot of people dying in the middle of no-one trying to control it. Well disturbed, me that day. Well done!\u201c\u2026 how can I apologize now\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I wish I could be a little more flexible too\u2026 it was too much\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201dApologize to Raini and Uffi with each other\u2019s dead eyes. No, I know how you feel, so I really can\u2019t say anything.\u201cWell, well. Look, I\u2019ll be happy to know what caused it and take care of it. Besides, Raini\u2019s power would be great if he could control it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I think you\u2019re no less talented than Uffi.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really? \u2018Cause I can\u2019t believe the power to confuse people like this\u2026 and who could ever want their blood\u2026?\u201cThat\u2019s the only way to break it off as constitution. It\u2019s not like you can choose to be born. That\u2019s why I think that power should be harnessed for people. Being able to interfere with people\u2019s spirits isn\u2019t all bad, at least. It\u2019s only right to use your powers. Therapy or something.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Therapy?Oh, well. I stuck to it, but didn\u2019t it make sense? In this world, when it comes to healing, magic is already the Lord\u2026\u201cPeople are really mind-breaking creatures. But with Raini\u2019s help, we might be able to alleviate that pain. I may be able to solve the hearts and minds of people with deep troubles, or I may be able to get them back on their feet. Wouldn\u2019t that be a great force to put it this way?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 but that\u2019s what happened to me\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, naturally, I can\u2019t. No one has mastered since that day because they have a sword. The technology needs to be polished or it will end immaturely. And if you work out the wrong way, it turns into something that lightly hurts people. Raini can randomly use his charm in the college to break into chaos, not just in the college, but in every country.\u201dYou have to understand the dangers of your power. Raini looked frightened, but that\u2019s not enough.\u201cRaini, you mustn\u2019t run from your power. I can\u2019t change how I scratched what\u2019s there. Containing the overflowing is not a natural condition. One day there will be bankruptcy. Take control of yourself so you don\u2019t. That\u2019s where I use it and not use it. Don\u2019t run away from knowing yourself.\u201d\u201cFrom myself, I don\u2019t run\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t run away. There was nothing from me. Scratch your feet, and what you desperately find is really scary. Still didn\u2019t throw it out. Sometimes he didn\u2019t want to throw it out, but he didn\u2019t want to run away from his responsibility.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Princess Anisphere was strong\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was nothing strong about it. I regretted it, and there were so many things I wanted to throw out. I don\u2019t want to be told I was strong from the start. \u2018Cause if you don\u2019t, I really wanted to cry,\u2019 cause I\u2019m gonna be gone.\u201dWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t use magic, my head turned white. But still, I paved the way for magic. I was just desperate to go that way.Now that I thought about it, I didn\u2019t seem to be facing reality. So I did the unscrupulous, and I did whatever I wanted. Because if not, I\u2019ll stop my leg. Because I have to face it.\u201cYeah? I mean, isn\u2019t this running away? No, you\u2019re not. Yeah, it\u2019s not a bad thing to run, but I can\u2019t keep running, but I guess it\u2019s right. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t run, is it? It\u2019s good to run away for one day. But you can\u2019t keep running.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t keep running\u2026\u201d\u201cMe, I\u2019ve thought about killing myself because I couldn\u2019t use magic, and that kind of thought was clear and unscrupulous and annoying to Ilia, and there were plenty of things that made both Father and Mother frighten me. But I made the roundabout, but I couldn\u2019t help myself, and I think I got something to replace it.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.It\u2019s only my subjectivity that I haven\u2019t escaped, and objectively it may seem like I\u2019ve escaped. Yeah, this awareness is important. If that\u2019s what they thought, I might have seen a bit of a reason why both stone heads in the Ministry of Magic hated me.Run away from your duties as a royalty and devour your time and materials for research you are not sure about. I don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s starting to improve. I may have been laughed at with my nose while I was scratching my feet, but I can\u2019t even keep laughing when I start to achieve results.Well! That\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t if I told you I was going to skip it! I didn\u2019t know that!!\u201cYeah. I mean, why don\u2019t we just win the last one?\u201cThat\u2019s a great throw!?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s getting difficult and troublesome\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess, as soon as you get in trouble, you run away, right? What didn\u2019t escape? Aren\u2019t you running away?\u201d\u201cShut up, Ilia! Yes, that was just moving forward! On my way!I admit I\u2019m a fugitive habitual, I don\u2019t like archery or anything. But this is moving forward, not running away! I\u2019m just straight down my path, and if that\u2019s what you see from someone else, you just look like you\u2019re running away! You\u2019re the guy with the difference of values!When I was thinking about such an explanation, Raini started laughing like he was breathing out. A year-to-year, heartfelt laugh out of power that is not aristocratic. There were thin tears in his eyes.\u201cTrue, that\u2019s crazy\u2026 I\u2019ve laughed so much, it\u2019s been awesome\u2026\u201d\u201cFun?\u201d\u201cFun?\u2026 right. Princess Anisphere is such a funny person, disrespectful as it may be, but she\u2019s really crazy and so horrible to be here\u2026 so\u2026 oh, sorry, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about anymore\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say\u2026\u201dSip your nose, try to say something, but you\u2019re speechless. Like saying that I\u2019m trembling for laughter and just can\u2019t contain overflowing emotions.Touch Raini\u2019s head like that. I found my shoulder jumped, but I keep stroking my head without worrying.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cOne day, I\u2019m sure, if you don\u2019t give up, you\u2019ll be able to convey the words you want to convey. But if you turn away, you won\u2019t be able to speak for life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh\u2026!\u201cWe may not make it. I might miss the opportunity. But, you know, I can\u2019t tell him, and if he doesn\u2019t, I think it hurts terribly. Raini should walk at Raini\u2019s stride width. If you want to run, you can run. You\u2019re free now. You don\u2019t have to be a baroness or a girl to be loved.\u201dYou just have to laugh honestly, cry honestly, be honest angry, and enjoy it honestly.Even if you shouldn\u2019t behave with emotions alone, noble or royal. I think it\u2019s a mistake to push everything to death. Otherwise people go crazy.Still, it\u2019s hard for everyone to be free. So at least if it\u2019s a permissible place, I have to tell you fully.\u201c\u2026 Princess Anisphere sounds like your sister\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen I stroked my head, Raini groaned pompously as to whether it had calmed down a bit.\u201c\u2026 you wanted such a sister\u201d\u201cAre you insane?\u201cShut up, Ilia. It was a really good scene right now.\u201dWhy deny it at no time, I\u2019ll cry on the boulder, too.\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d freak out if I had a sister or a sister like this\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so powerful!? Oh, I even started laughing at Yufi!?\u201d\u201cNo, because I feel the same as Miss Raini\u2026 but I also know how Ilia feels\u2026\u201dYufi says with a laugh of couscous. Ilia has a complicated look on her face, and Raini laughs at Nico at some point. It\u2019s perfectly peaceful. My rating is on you, though!\u201cUm\u2026 I may have forgotten, but I\u2019m the real sister? There\u2019s Al.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Speaking of which, they don\u2019t look alike at all\u2026\u201d\u201cHonestly, even when they say sister and brother\u2026\u201dRaini breathed and Yufi nodded to agree. No, well, it\u2019s a man and a woman, and they don\u2019t look like each other. Who is Al Kun?\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do anything like a sister. Either way, they think you\u2019re just an enemy with blood connected, don\u2019t they?\u201c\u2026 are you so unfriendly?\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. It\u2019s just that Al has a reason to hate me, so there\u2019s no choice.\u201d\u201cYou mean the right to inherit the throne? But Master Algard\u2019s up there from the beginning, isn\u2019t he?\u201cOf course there\u2019s a reason for that, too\u2026. Well, can I say it. It\u2019s kind of an uninteresting old story.\u201dI don\u2019t mean to break this fun air, but it\u2019s not like these kids have anything to do with Al. Most importantly, I wanted to talk to you. It\u2019s hard to say I won\u2019t be involved in the future.It is better for you to know more about me and Al than to come to my side. That\u2019s what I started talking about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was just before Yufi and I decided to get engaged. Or maybe you can say that my fault has led me to an engagement with Uffi\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?Yufi stared at my face with a decent face. You didn\u2019t know what was going on around there.\u201cAs it turns out. At the time, Yuffi was chosen because she was good, but it was definitely my fault that she decided to choose her fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cHow can Princess Anisphere cause this?\u201cHmm\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to, hey\u201dRaini\u2019s question is natural. When people really ask me why that happened, all I can say is that it turned out.\u201cI thought Al was after my life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cFact is, you said you were about to kill me\u2026 you said you were about to let me die\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could that happen!?\u201dUffi was distracted by the facts I told him. But I\u2019m gonna get my mind back on it right away and get the scratch on it. I think such a reaction would be the best. No, really. Even I think so.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that. I was just an idiot back then. My sister wanted to please my brother, and I took Al out on a trip.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve had a fugitive habit since then\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already been famous since then. I was too young to do my best, and I was really rushed back.\u201dWhether Ilia remembers what happened at the time, she groans in a bitter voice. No, I\u2019m really sorry about that verse\u2026\u201cSo I took Al to the woods. I wanted to get my own Spirit Stone, and I felt light-hearted to teach Al the knowledge I\u2019d never seen to get out of it as much as I thought it would be fun. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m too young to laugh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 have you been studying magic since then?\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t help but do what I came up with. That\u2019s why I used to get Al involved a lot. I made him cry a lot, and we laughed a lot together. That\u2019s why I was wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026 a mistake, is it?\u201cMistake\u2026\u2026 no, you\u2019re not. I was ignorant. I didn\u2019t think properly about my responsibilities as a royalty or my surrounding eyes. That\u2019s what happened because I\u2019m an idiot.\u201dIf I close my eyes, I can still remember that time vividly. Because it was still the last time I was dating Al, my sister and my brother.He was somewhere weak and hesitated to follow me if I gave him my hand, Al. Yes, that day was just as usual. Nothing was going to change, a little adventure.\u201cWe went into the woods and tried to get the Spirit Stone, and we ran into demons.\u201d\u201c\u2026 eh\u201dBreathtaking as Raini ceased to say to me. When you say you ran into a demon at a young age without a guard, it\u2019s natural, but breathtaking, isn\u2019t it?\u201cTwo royal children got out and were attacked by demons. Really, you\u2019ve done something stupid.\u201d\u201cYou were well safe\u2026\u201dI shook my neck left and right to Raini, who whimpered with a clich\u00e9. It seems to deny Raini\u2019s words.\u201cI was safe.\u201d\u201c\u2026 something happened to Master Algard?\u201cI\u2019ve been defenseless since that time, and even Al\u2019s sister was aware of it. It\u2019s my responsibility to take you out on that. I dealt with the demon myself and told Al to run away. Al ran away without defying me.\u201dI\u2019ve never cursed my recklessness because it\u2019s my responsibility. I regretted so much that I should have gotten out on my own even if I wanted to.That\u2019s why I thought I had to protect Al. I didn\u2019t care that I couldn\u2019t use magic. I was also fortunate to be collecting spiritual stones. I managed to survive against demons using spiritual stones with all my hardships.\u201cI was immediately protected by a knight who rushed to hear the noise. But I couldn\u2019t find Al.\u201d\u201c\u2026 were you attacked by another demon?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the point. If I simply hid to hide myself, my discovery would be delayed. I ran around the woods without asking myself to look for it. So, I\u2019m the one who found Al.\u201d\u201cIs that the cause of the misconduct\u2026\u2026?\u201cThat too, but I think maybe that was the problem afterwards. At that time, I was pimping with no injuries, so I was simply happy to find Al.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what the hell did you do?\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dI smile bitterly at Yuffi\u2019s questionable questions. I wonder if the suspicion that I did something is something that you would think so if you knew me. I won\u2019t deny it, though.But I really did that day. I\u2019m just really glad Al\u2019s okay.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I was pimped. If I had been slightly injured, I might have been able to explain it. Someone told me. Anisphere tried to assassinate Algard.\u201dYufi and Raini breathed in the words I told them. I keep the conversation pale without worrying about how you two are doing.\u201cI was pimped, and I was the first to be discovered by a knight. Someone told me that\u2019s why I set it up. I said I wasn\u2019t, but it\u2019s not easy to wipe away the perception that spread once. And I had a motive.\u201d\u201cIs that a motive?\u201cWe all knew I had been obsessed with magic since that time. That\u2019s why you tried to kill Al when you were jealous.\u201dThere is no smoke in the absence of fire. I mean, I was seen with the right motive. I couldn\u2019t use magic, and I was obsessed with magic. I thought you were jealous of Al Kun, who could use magic.Except if you think so around me when I say I\u2019m different. Even though I was a weirdo. It was even more offensive because I had a sense of consciousness. They even thought it was madness, so naturally some doubted if what I said was true.\u201cSo I realized I was a child with the right to inherit the throne. He said he might pull Al-Kun\u2019s leg just because I\u2019m around. That\u2019s why I thoroughly crushed the factors that make Al your political enemy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 does that lead you to declare you\u2019re not engaged\u201d\u201cI was desperate to get rid of the thought of him trying to kill me because of his desire for the throne and his jealousy for Al. It was more convenient because they thought I was crazy from around. There were times when Al was cute, but I didn\u2019t want to get caught up in such a hassle and be unable to study it.\u201d\u201cOh, that was already the usual Princess Anisphere there\u2026\u201dWell, because that\u2019s me. Because my magical obsession is a wish that has been on my backbone since the day I became one.That\u2019s why I wanted to have magic in my hands. That was just it. It\u2019s not like I wanted to interrupt Al\u2019s becoming king, and I didn\u2019t want Al to die.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIt worked. I did the impotence, but it did what I wanted. Now no one wants me to be a king, or a king\u2019s wife. That\u2019s why I told Al you don\u2019t have to worry anymore. I thought it would be better if I stayed away until my suspicions cleared, and now I can finally apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026 did you apologize?\u201cI apologized. But he didn\u2019t have ears to listen to. I guess it was too late or I couldn\u2019t take it back anymore. So I think whatever you did was in vain.\u201dI think our differences were decided that day when we took Al Kun out into the woods.\u201cAl wasn\u2019t suspicious of me. It\u2019s not there. Me and Al are the cause of this mismatch.\u201d\u201cThen why did Algard get along with Anisphere?\u201cI overdid it. I shut my father and mother up too much. I did what I could for it. At the time, I won my freedom even by tapping on the achievements of a handful of magic studies. Kids beat the shit out of adult-face losers. What do you think of that?\u201c\u2026 abnormal, right\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s an anomaly. From Al Kun\u2019s point of view, I was a madman. And he had the head and action of an adult-faced loser. Al said this. Whether my sister wants it or not, she wants to kill me. Someone told me my sister was good. They said I couldn\u2019t do it\u2026. Don\u2019t play witch mountain. We\u2019re talking.\u201dHa ha. The vain zero laughter was less powerful than I thought.I can\u2019t forget the look on Al\u2019s face distorted by fear and despair.\u201cNobody. He compared me to Al. Where I forfeited my inheritance, you didn\u2019t take it the way you wanted me to. Al Kun had me in the monster. Being alone had made me a monster that took away everything, my place, my value. \u2018Cause the right to inherit the throne I threw away was something I took for granted, and they recognized me as threatening it. No matter how much I tell you I\u2019m going to be king.\u201dAm I laughing? I mean, I\u2019m laughing when I\u2019m talking about this, but I don\u2019t often see it that way. Fact is, I can\u2019t laugh, so maybe it comes naturally to my face.\u201cNo matter how much I wished for Al Kun\u2019s future, I couldn\u2019t get my hands on it. He said he could take the throne if I wanted. He said that if I could only use magic, I wouldn\u2019t be worth it. I was just born a man, I could just use magic. It\u2019s inferior to me. That I should be king. I\u2019m the enemy.\u201dI distanced myself from Al because I thought it would be good. That gave Alkun enough time to breathe in what he didn\u2019t need.And all that remained was the result that we became nominal sisters and brothers. I went on the path to the exploration of magic, and Al-Kun was to be taken on the path to the king.\u201cBecause of my overdoing, Al Kun became desirable for a lot. An excellent queen who can guide her country through her qualities as a royal family by stretching her magical talents that I do not possess to replace magic. I pulled myself back to say it was for Al, but I thought I\u2019d like it because it was already a hassle. That\u2019s why I like it. Being king doesn\u2019t bother me, he doesn\u2019t want to. He said we\u2019re not getting involved anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so you broke up?\u201cThere were many reasons, but think that no one would think of me as a king if I didn\u2019t pull away and fulfill my duty as royalty. In fact, he\u2019s gone. It didn\u2019t matter to me anymore. I was thinking about getting out of this country.\u201dIn fact, I think if it weren\u2019t for your father and your mother, you would have left the country. My father and mother respected my freedom and stopped me from connecting. I don\u2019t blame Ilia, my only trusted squire, for doing adventurous or angry residence. He even gives me a budget.It was not a legitimate family relationship, but it connected a relationship that seemed to break off like a boss and subordinate. Then I grew up too. Compared to when I was a kid, I could tell.\u201cWell, I said it heavily. Is it heavy now? Until a little while ago, we were thinking,\u201d We\u2019re not good at each other, and we had a lot to do with it. \u201c\u201c\u2026 oh, so you had a mild attitude about not being so serious\u201d\u201cIt also meant posing. Because Al won\u2019t like you, and I thought it would be a hassle to get involved.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have a little trouble figuring out if you\u2019re thinking about it or not\u2026\u201dNo, I think you\u2019re both right. Based on that, I just chose not to worry.I didn\u2019t mean to help Al when he told me he wanted to be king, and I thought it was something that would be on his own. Whatever you say around you, your father and mother will do something about it.Well, that\u2019s broken, too. Yeah? Can\u2019t this be funny? No, that\u2019s not funny. Al, can we roll back from here, really?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I was born\u2026\u201d\u201cHey Raini!? Sister, you didn\u2019t blame me that much, or it was just really a bad time!?\u201dSure, Raini is the one who smashed the situation so far fixed!? Don\u2019t look far with dead eyes. Look at me, Raini!\u201cBut without me\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe so, but that\u2019s why I can\u2019t admit what Al did. At a time when I had not taken formal steps to break my engagement with Yufi. Even Raini is a force majeure.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cIn the first place, it could be my fault for pushing you into such a situation. I don\u2019t know Al. Because I can\u2019t figure it out for you anymore.\u201dThat only makes me a little, no, very guilty.If I could hold hands with Al like I did at a young age. Maybe there was a future where everyone could laugh.It\u2019s so hard to do that, I can\u2019t take it back anymore. Still, I can\u2019t help but think.I never noticed Uffi staring at me all the time, trying not to appear on my face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: 24The identity of Raini\u2019s demonic stone, the progress of the Vampire Fact Sheet. Today was a brilliant and fulfilling day.Raini also had reports that his senses had changed since passing magic on the Demon Stone. I wonder if we need to keep track of the details in the future. So far, so good. As much as I want to unwittingly sing my nose song.After all, exploration is good. Know what you didn\u2019t know and absorb it as your own knowledge. If Raini imagines expanding her possibilities as to what she will be able to do, her dreams will spread. My chest dances to such a forecast of the future.I turn on the lights and run the pen even as the night goes deeper. There are limits to what you can remember. That\u2019s why I keep writing my thoughts. A note line with no takedowns, other than me, may not know the exact meaning.Second, the door to the room was knocked as if a paragraph was on and aimed at the timing at which the pen was placed.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cDear Anis, it\u2019s me\u201d\u201cUffi? There you are. Open it now.\u201dIt was Uffi\u2019s voice that I heard from across the door. When I open the door, Uffi stands, who had already finished his sleeping schedule. I invite her into my room and start making tea.\u201cTea, I\u2019ll prepare it, sit down and wait.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you know we need to talk.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dLet Yufi sit down and prepare tea for two. Sit down to face Uffi and sip a cup of tea. My body, which I had concentrated on writing until earlier, is slightly hardened and I turn my arms to untie my body.Uffi also put his mouth on the tea and then exhaled softly. I decided to wait for Yufi to start talking because I was wondering how she was going to cut the story out.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s hard to make weak noises\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was any certainty between Anise and Algard.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like making it public. Even if the hang-up wasn\u2019t known, it\u2019s a well-known fact that Al and I weren\u2019t close anymore.\u201dI don\u2019t think I could do anything about that right now. It\u2019s the result of my move without thought, so I have to take it.At the time I had no idea what the weight of the right to inherit the throne was. I will not be king. I was optimistic that Al-Kun would be king.If only I could support Al in the future as my sister. I was thinking that if I could study magic while helping Al, it would be fine.I was too short-circuited, I had no idea. The incident with Al-Kun is one of my hateful failures.But I can\u2019t even just regret it. Honestly, I\u2019d be lying to Al if I told him I didn\u2019t have pangs myself. How can you not understand, my God.I didn\u2019t mean to hurt Al. I\u2019m not going to be an enemy. I hope you don\u2019t mind the words around you. I always thought it would be good if Al became king and was good. I really wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to understand.But if you can\u2019t tell them, it\u2019s no use trying to understand. Then I should live my life and stay out of it, Al. That\u2019s how my relationship with Al went cold.\u201cWas Master Algard suffering too?\u201d\u201cI guess I was in pain. It seemed tougher than I thought.\u201dWhen my father told me that I behaved so unroyally, that there were still many who supported me, I didn\u2019t even think about it.Al Kun will be king, and I never thought I\u2019d be king either. So I proceeded to behave like I was called a freak. That would make it impossible for anyone to stand me up.(Actually, Ilia\u2019s parents did. I had a relationship at first since I made Ilia exclusive, but I couldn\u2019t stomach him for treating Ilia or anything, so I poked him a little bit.)Then Ilia\u2019s parents stopped coming after me. Everywhere I go, I am Princess Kiteretz. Even with the merit of magic, it is not suitable as a king.It may be popular with the people because they were distracted and close to the civilian population. Still, it is the nobles who move the country. So I stop there even if it\u2019s popular.Many nobles are proud to be able to use magic. So no one can stand me up because I can\u2019t use magic, and even if I were there, I wouldn\u2019t be able to push those people away.So nobody expects anything from me. Even if I did, I don\u2019t have the power to move public opinion, just someone who understands. Maybe you can change it if you make a big announcement about the achievements of magic and try to spread it. The change will cause a great deal of turmoil in the country.So it was best for Al to be king, and the story should fit in round. This is how it turns out.\u201c\u2026 would something have changed if I had leaned closer to Master Algard\u201d\u201cUffi is a true, irretrievable failure.\u201dIt was an irresistible failure. It\u2019s not like one of us was bad, but everyone made a little cause of it. It was this incident that happened overlapping. I can\u2019t blame anyone for being bad.If you blame that, then you must seek sin from all human beings. I think there\u2019s a lot of responsibility, though. Then I think it would be better if you were punished for flirting with this nasty situation now.\u201cI can\u2019t make up for it without fail, but I can make up for it with my next success. You can\u2019t keep succeeding all the time. Because there isn\u2019t, we all do our best for fear of failure. I think Uffi will learn to make this mistake and get the next big success.\u201d\u201cDear Anis\u2026 I\u2019m really positive and envious\u201d\u201cThe world is wide and the dreams are far away than I have time to turn around.\u201dMagic was once a dream story. Unreachable fantasy. But I think I can reach it now. I can\u2019t help but stretch. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have time to look back. Time is finite. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to end.I am me. But all of a sudden, the day may come when I\u2019m not me. \u2018Cause it\u2019s just a coincidence that I was able to get my memories back from my previous life, too. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know, so I\u2019m not surprised what happens.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t just want to stop my legs. I want to be running straight to my dreams, just straight. I want to live this life to the fullest.\u201c\u2026 because I haven\u2019t decided what I want to be yet\u201d\u201cYou just have to think slowly. I have my life, Uffi has Uffi\u2019s life. That\u2019s how they all live. Now the road is just with me. The time may come for us to break up, and even if we break up, we may rub it off somewhere again, and the road may connect again. I don\u2019t even know what happened.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, too\u201dYuffi shrugged and laughed. Next I lay my eyes down to get lost. I lay my eyes down for a while, but my slowly open eyes stare straight at me.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis. I need a favor.\u201d\u201cHmm? What?\u201c\u2026 may I escort you to bed today\u201d\u201cAccompanying? Nothing good, though.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026. because I got a little anxious. I\u2019m afraid to sleep like this.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d be happy to.\u201dThat\u2019s a cute favor, what a little laugh. But I think it\u2019s a good trend. Yufi could be sweeter. I guess I haven\u2019t done that before. Then you can take it back from now on.My bed is as big as a royal bed. There\u2019s plenty of room for both of us to sleep. Try to invite Yufi. I\u2019ll go into bed first, then I\u2019ll attract her.\u201cHave you ever had someone sleep with you?\u201cWhen I was little, I told my mother\u201d\u201cOh well. Then I\u2019ll adore you as Uffi today. Look, come on.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not old enough to wear it anymore.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care\u201dLie side by side in bed and wear a futon. I lay down to look at each other, and laughter came in from either side.\u201cGood night, Uffi\u201dLift your forehead to do so to your toddler and then drop a kiss on your forehead. Because Yufi is taller when he usually stands, so he can\u2019t do it! Yuffi, kissed on the forehead, turns her eyes round and laughs as if she was in trouble in some light.\u201c\u2026 good night\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before I fell asleep. I think Yufi\u2019s hand grabbed my hand before I fell asleep. I fell asleep shaking that hand back.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll be checking Raini\u2019s abilities in earnest from today on\u201d\u201cYes, thank you\u201dBecause I slept slowly and took the day off, Raini\u2019s complexion is pretty good. After all, people can work hard when they feel progress. I want you to remain confident in yourself and be able to control your abilities.\u201cShall we start with a check-up? How\u2019s the demon stone?\u201cRight. I have no problems with my health. Rather, it\u2019s very refreshing to say that the senses have become clearer. I feel like the magic is flowing through the stones.\u201d\u201cIs the power of the Demon Stone going to be dampened?\u201cYes, I can\u2019t breathe better going with just a little bit of magic than trying to stop the magic. That way, you won\u2019t even be able to get into places where there\u2019s a feeling that magic is going to happen\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dThere are more or less things I have come to understand while I continue to examine Raini. After all, Raini\u2019s demonic stone is very similar to the nature of my engraving.The difference is that it is always operational. My engraving will never exert its power without instilling my magic. Sometimes I take magic on my own with defensive reactions, but there\u2019s nothing rampant about it. I think it\u2019s also the result of the adjustment.In contrast, Raini has the Demon Stone in constant operation. Sometimes it\u2019s integrated with the heart, and I can\u2019t breathe when I try to stop the function, or the flow of magic.Instead, it has the advantage that it can always be kept through magic. This is an advantage not found in my engraving. Engraving is too influential when you\u2019re instilling magic, so you only instill magic when you need it.As for the power of vampires, this was honestly good news because with proper consciousness, we seem to be able to narrow down and weaken our magic to avoid activating the power of the Demon Stone.\u201cIlia, how about watching Raini compared to yesterday?\u201cRight\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem particularly unusual though\u201d\u201cHmm, I wonder if the recognition is imprinted even if the charm isn\u2019t activated once it hits the charm. Maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t know the difference. This is definitely troublesome\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to try anything new.\u201d\u201cSorry for the inconvenience\u2026\u201dI really wanted to check the comparison between when I was using force and when I wasn\u2019t, but I\u2019m not going to make Raini\u2019s power public, so I\u2019m going to stop.According to Raini, it was the eyes, the throat and the nails on the teeth that were particularly magical. Each confirmation indicates that the eyes and throat can act as catalysts for mental interference and that the nails and fangs can increase or deform strength. I really admire you for being like a vampire.\u201cPhysical strengthening is easier to do than before. However, the senses became clearer, but the magic of using the Spirit didn\u2019t feel particularly stretched\u2026\u201d\u201cSpirit magic and magic that can be used with magic stones are similar and different. Maybe the usual magical aptitude isn\u2019t that high for Raini because it\u2019s something that\u2019s originally the same but derived. Rather, it fits the vampire\u2019s demon stone, so I can think of a possibility of stopping by.\u201d\u201cI see. Even if a vampire is a wizard, your father is a civilian.\u201d\u201cBut I hear you\u2019re a fine adventurer. Do you want Raini to work out her body, too? Maybe he\u2019s talented, huh?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it\u201dAs a little troubled, Raini smiles with a smile that doesn\u2019t make her feel the color of the shadow. Although she doesn\u2019t seem like a lady, she looks better on Raini\u2019s smile right now.But maybe there\u2019s a direction to build your body. The nails can increase or deform the strength of the fingernails on the hands and feet, and the more strength and magic you can put in, the more iron and colorless strength you can get. Though I was most surprised by the person I verified.\u201cVampires are horrible when you try this\u2026\u2026 if you don\u2019t have to hide the dark vessel. If you have nails, you turn into a weapon quickly. Spiritual interference of charm, the virtues of the magical streets of physical strengthening. If this is a trait as a species, it\u2019s nothing more than a threat.\u201d\u201cBring it to the assassination\u2026 you\u2019re not surrounded by intelligence in some country, are you?\u201cThat\u2019s a funny imagination.\u201dBut I understand Ilia\u2019s fear. Vampires disappeared from the history of the tabular stage. But Raini found out that its existence could have survived to modern times.If it was moving as intelligence in another country, it would be frightening. This has to surround Raini with everything.If you are a mother, you may want to appeal to Raini\u2019s danger and that is why it will be used as a countermeasure. At the moment, it doesn\u2019t seem that my mother is attracted to other countries.Still, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to do anything about it when we find out it exists. Though I was born with no choice, there are few options for the future that Raini can choose from.\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s no such thing as being a queen.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cAre you going to brainwash the people?\u201cHa, then you\u2019re a real dictatorship. It\u2019s a joke, a joke\u201dRaini was bluishing his face brightly into conversation with Ilia and shaking his face left and right vigorously. Raini\u2019s expression has been soft lately because she has understood herself. I feel like a little animal somewhere, and I want to stick with my love.But I think I\u2019ll check Raini again. Engraving and demon stones, the difference. Engraving is only something that draws strength. But Demon Stone is what makes you pervert. No matter how much you adjust the engraving to fit your body, it doesn\u2019t become like a demon stone.(I didn\u2019t mean to quit on humans, but the difference, I guess)If you were trying to transplant the Dragon\u2019s Demon Stone intact to your magical desire. I would have become something that wasn\u2019t a person by now. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing, but in the end I didn\u2019t choose that option.So I imagine. What would have happened if I had pursued magic until I became a dragon?\u201c\u2026 if I went that far, it wouldn\u2019t be me anymore\u201dI\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t choose, and if you have me that you chose, at that point, you\u2019re already someone else. Can I remember why I pursued magic until I quit people? What did you really want to use that magic for?\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis?\u201cUfi?\u201dTwo, when I was blurry, Uffi called me out. Uffi was peeking into his face as consciousness returned to reality.\u201cSorry, I was a little blurry. What is it?As a matter of fact, someone came earlier.\u201cUsing\u2026?\u201cYes, from the Ministry of Magic\u201d\u201cRoar.\u201dUse it from the Ministry of Magic? I wouldn\u2019t normally do that. What the hell are you doing here?\u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201cThe other day, what was the magic prop that His Majesty was riding on? He asked for an explanation.\u201d\u201cYou got airdra? \u2026 have you been blinded by the material?\u201dThat\u2019s my personal property. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be taken away, but I\u2019m going to have difficulty. I lied about hunting by myself, and they\u2019re going to tell me where I bought it from, and if I didn\u2019t put that money out of the treasury. I really like it.\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what I want you to do. She wants an opportunity to reveal herself at the Ministry of Magic. I was wondering if we could do an exhibition of magic gear to help us understand each other as well as Airdra.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHas the Ministry of Magic ever said such a special victory? I wonder if he\u2019ll even shake his spear tomorrow. If you put out that magic trick, they\u2019ll come after you? You want to throw a party for the exhibition? Sponsored by you?The practitioner wizards I understand are also in the Ministry of Magic, but the strong roots are the researchers of magic faith, theology. Practitioners are not that high, and they are not good friends with them.Practitioners do whatever they want with political plays and executive chairs, which is one of the main reasons. Therefore, even if it is favourable between individuals, it is neutral to the Ministry of Magic itself and to what I do, so I will not be on my side.\u201cAnd my assistant wanted me to attend, so I came to see him\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I guess the aim is Ufi\u201dSure, right now, if I were to get Uffi out of here, I\u2019d stick around for the reason that he\u2019s my assistant. But for me, it\u2019s hard to say no if Yuffi is also assigned to accompany him as an assistant.If I didn\u2019t have Uffi even if I attended alone, I still don\u2019t think I deserve to be an assistant, and so on, it would be extremely troublesome if they told me.What happens if I refuse the invitation of the Ministry of Magic? Perhaps it will deepen the conflict. Then they could even talk to me about the budget they\u2019re putting me on. To the extent they are there, they need to show their faces. They are loud.If so, it\u2019s probably Uffi if you say what the Ministry of Magic is after. No matter how much magic props are said to be excellent, I don\u2019t really think the body of a Ministry of Magic with lots of wizards of Magicism will change soon. So it\u2019s a coincidence to say that you should get along with me.That\u2019s why I think the aim is Uffi. If you think you want to pull through competent Uffi as a wizard or you want to have that opportunity, Tsuji fits.Unexpectedly the face of Lang in the Count Voltaire family came to mind. I chewed my back teeth off because I was accidentally mushy.\u201cDeadly Yufi, I wish I could find the crude demon prop. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 am I the destiny?\u201cYou want it for your wife. Leaving an excellent pedigree for the next generation, I don\u2019t know.\u201dKeh, I throw up without thinking about it. I know it sounds aristocratic, but it\u2019s not my favorite idea. I don\u2019t mean that Uffi is talented to have children. What a guy who doesn\u2019t try to make Yufi happy at that point.If Yufi is happy, I\u2019ll just have to swallow it no matter how much I hate it as much as I\u2019m likely to throw up. Well, that\u2019s not all I can do. Though not funny.Still, I\u2019m protecting Yufi. Then you won\u2019t have to complain if you let your eyes shine.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s not a very interesting story. Too bad.\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Magic has never stopped by me for the rest of my life. Unless I treat the Spirit as something to worship. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have faith either.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re not enthusiastic.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. I won\u2019t deny that.\u201dWell, what shall we do? It is not very nice to say no to this. Even though it\u2019s a time when I don\u2019t want to have a wave, it\u2019s extremely troublesome.It is confirmed that me and Uffi will be present. It\u2019s out of the question to just let Uffi go, and if I\u2019m the only one out, I could be obnoxious about Uffi. But even if we both attend, it\u2019s just what they\u2019re after. Ugh, I\u2019m angry.\u201cI want Ilia to come with me, too, but maybe the lady will tell me to back off.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s no way to attend\u2026\u201dEveryone\u2019s gaze concentrates on Raini. Raini, who was gazed at, shrunk into smaller pieces.Yes, Ilia can\u2019t take him. Considering that you have to look at Raini. Then I\u2019ll have to get on with their thoughts, touching my thoughts.\u201cMm, you don\u2019t have a choice. Let\u2019s attend. If we can, let\u2019s take something that doesn\u2019t seem to stand a corner. Ilaria sends her regards about Raini.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in awe, princess\u201dHa, that\u2019s depressing. I hope it\u2019s over with nothing\u2026\u2013 We\u2019re ready.\u201c\u2026 right\u201dThat\u2019s a dark room to avoid people\u2019s attention and to avoid attention. There are those who exchange words in it.\u201cIt\u2019s all for you and us\u2026\u201d\u201cOh. Whatever you do, I\u2019ll have you guys hanging out.\u201d\u201cOf course it is. I\u2019ve been interrupted so far. You won\u2019t fail.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know\u201dThe signs of those who were having conversations disputed in the darkness disappear.The one left was small and exhaled softly.\u201cAlmost there.\u201dWith so much emotion that I couldn\u2019t fit into the words that I whined small.It was anger. It was hatred. It\u2019s hot as a fiery flame.At the same time, it interacts with coolness to the point of cooling. Fierce but therefore keeps killing, contradictory emotions.Shadows that are cold enough to push and kill fiercely burning emotions also disappear into darkness.The shadows swoop. In the darkness, crawl quietly. Until the time came\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: 25The day came for an exhibition party of magic props sponsored by the Ministry of Magic. Regardless of the demonic props I could hold, I was really short of manpower to carry Airdra, and I was supposed to call people from the Royal Palace.What\u2026 I wonder why they\u2019re mixed up in the Ministry of Magic. You don\u2019t usually lean away from the palace. No, I assume it\u2019s natural for you to prepare?\u201cDear Anis, there\u2019s a wrinkle between your eyebrows.\u201dThe wrinkles between the deeply carved eyebrows are unlikely to return even when Uffi points them out. Honestly, I don\u2019t like the magic ministry guys touching my magic props. It\u2019s going to be deliberately destroyed and obfuscated.It cannot be said that magic props differ in quality from magic to magic, depending on the skill of the user. Standards are only troublesome when mass production is not uniform.And they say that the Ministry of Magic doesn\u2019t have a nose. Demonic props are inferior to magic. They can\u2019t reflect the skill of the user.Though I\u2019ve touched the magic, I\u2019m not aiming to spread it the same way I do! It\u2019s more important that anyone can use it easily!When it comes to magic props that can be used as a daily necessity, if you keep asking me what it\u2019s like to use spiritual stones for something like this, I can bounce off the rage accumulated in the accumulation.I usually avoid it because it\u2019s a pain in the ass for them. That doesn\u2019t mean the frustration disappears. My roaring voice leaks out unexpectedly.\u201cPrincess Anisphere. Are you sure that\u2019s all for the exhibition today?\u201c\u2026 checking the inventory is ok. Instructions are later available for each magic prop. Look first for precautions. If you try to use it in a way other than the specifications, you cannot be held responsible. Then be sure to follow the instructions of the samurai I requested. If anything happens, I\u2019ll be in trouble during the exhibition.\u201dIf I gave him the thick instructions with an overview, the man from the Ministry of Magic gave me a convulsive grin. You want me to read this? That\u2019s just the look on your face. That would be the job, but I\u2019m not complaining because I worked this one too. You must have asked me out in the first place.\u2026 No, I shouldn\u2019t. This attitude is not good. What are we going to do if we sell a fight from here before something starts? The purpose of this meeting is to bring the exhibition party to an end. Smile here and be honest!\u201cAsk me or Uffi if you need anything. I will explain it sincerely and clearly.\u201d\u201cHih\u2026\u2026!What the hell? Person responsible for staying tuned and returning to site command as soon as possible. I feel the smile that was floating back to the top of the Buddha again. I can\u2019t solve my current reaction when I said I handled it with a smile on my face.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis, there was now a killer seeping out of my smile\u201dOh, yeah.\u201cHe said it would be nice if there wasn\u2019t a wave of wind on his own\u2026\u201dYufi sighed as if she were frightened. That\u2019s why you handled it with a smile! It\u2019s bad over there that scares me! Me, not bad!I have to go to the royal palace because I have to check on myself in the royal palace, thinking about the waste of such a child. Ilaria\u2019s leaving today, so we\u2019re going to have people out of the royal palace.At a time like this, I don\u2019t think it would be convenient to spin it in small numbers from time to time. The title is too heavy. I just want to throw it away. Shall I hit your father with a paper plane that says right to inherit the throne? Oh, no. If they find me because I have a mother, they will kill me.\u201cRuss boss is still my mother\u2026\u2026!\u201cWhat are you talking about, I\u2019m coming\u201dI snorted reluctantly, prompted by Ufi, who said away in a sigh.Then Ilaria, you\u2019re coming.\u201cYes, please be careful\u201d\u2018Cause if anything happens, you can skip me.\u2019\u201cYes.\u201dIf it\u2019s as far away as the Royal Palace, there\u2019s something you can use in the prototype\u2019s demonic props. I really want to achieve long-range communication. I have no idea how to make a phone call or anything like that on a boulder, and I hope I get some ideas flashing.Ha, it\u2019s a hassle, but do you want to go? Feeling like something heavy accumulated in my stomach, I headed with Yufi to the royal palace.The party venue for the exhibition, prepared by the Ministry of Magic, is one of the halls that is also used in royal palace feasts, etc. There are several halls in the Royal Palace that can be used to coincide with the event, of which the format has been determined and the venue has been changed by the event.This time, it\u2019s the lowest formatted hall because it\u2019s not that big. Still a hall on royal palace grounds. The decoration is made of first-class products, and given its size, it could be said to be gorgeous enough. Then the participants must be dressed as they deserve.\u201cHeavy dress, long hem. Out of the way.\u201d\u201cDear Anis\u2026\u201dPolished by the royal palace samurai, she complains about the dress she has recently had more chance to wear with something. Truth is, dresses are heavy and painful. Oh, no. Good one-piece dress for everyday knight clothing motifs. Wouldn\u2019t it look like that if I wore a medal or something?Though maybe she\u2019ll smile and get rejected by Ilia or her mother. Still, I won\u2019t give up on taking off my tough dress\u2026!\u201cPrincess Anisphere, Dear Uphilia. I\u2019m ready. Come to the venue.\u201dThe samurai bows her head respectfully and tells her. The exhibition hall for the magic props has already been set up, and later it will be the flow for me to enter the venue and give a description of the magic props.This time the eyeball is Airdra. Well, you want to hear what I made out of plenty of dragon material.To put it bluntly, this is a presentation. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get consent because the values are different where I presented them. I guess they\u2019re after me to get the bollocks out anyway.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s okay, Dear Anis\u201d\u201cUfi?\u201d\u201cBecause I know.\u201dAs I perceived in my heart, I forget myself unexpectedly by the words of Yufi conveyed with a grin. The stained words are strangely embarrassing and my stomach tickles. I was hit, I thought it was natural and my gait was faster.That one is cunning. But that\u2019s good. I hope someone understands. Someone will find value beside me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m happy about. So fine.Nature and sight gather in the venue. Airdra was resting on the stage where I headed. Go up to the altar with Uffi and give him a compliment.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, be in a good mood. We are very pleased to have this event open today. Today is a time to deepen our understanding of the inventions of magic, and it is up to us to be brave.\u201dWhen I raise my head and then say hello, my reactions vary. There\u2019s a lot to see as doing the price trail as I imagined. Surprisingly, there were a few people eager to hear this story.Well, what is it? I can\u2019t think of any reason why I could turn that gaze on you. I\u2019m just a little surprised by the unexpected, but I\u2019ll keep explaining.\u201cFirst of all, I think you\u2019re wondering, this is Airdra, the flying magic prop I developed. This one is made of dragon material and has a hull that can withstand the propulsion and its propulsion utilizing the dragon\u2019s exhalation mechanism. This one was produced with the aim of limiting performance, but we are also working on a concept of mass production based on the design of this prototype.\u201dKeep breathing and continue explaining. Airdra and the purpose for which flying magic props are used, the economic benefits that can be expected from the spread of flying magic props, the revolution in itineraries, etc.The reaction of listeners varies again. I keep watching such an audience, but I keep going until I separate the explanation.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s all about flying magic props\u201dWhere I divided the explanation, Uffi comes forward. That\u2019s what I was planning.If I remain a little confused, Uffi opens his tease with a grace.\u201cI\u2019m Uphilia Magenta, and I\u2019m your assistant to Princess Anisphere. This time, I am very pleased that the people of the Ministry of Magic have been given the opportunity to open such a place and talk about a promising future through magic. As Princess Anisphere explained, we are concerned that some people in the Ministry of Magic have doubts that this invention is a blasphemy to the Spirit and God.\u201dHey!? Yufi, are you going to cut in there!? Look, there are a bunch of people who changed their complexion to see it.\u201cCertainly Princess Anisphere\u2019s idea doesn\u2019t exist. It may seem like a bold, in other words incomprehensible reason to the rest of us. But if I\u2019m going to tell you this from someone I\u2019ve seen close to me, I\u2019d like to tell you that magic is a sign of respect for them that\u2019s different from spiritual beliefs and theology.\u201dYuffi just talks pale. It just draws attention to its appearance. I can\u2019t help but notice.\u201cKnowing the world, knowing reason, knowing magic, all of which go hand in hand, magic is born. Magic is also equal to academia and never makes faith or tradition contemptible. Rather, it was born with the tradition and wisdom that we have inherited, and I wonder if my kingdom should be proud that the gift of Princess Anisphere was born in this world.\u201dNo, you don\u2019t have to be proud, I thought, but you read the air with me. Tighten your expression and stretch your spine. For a moment, I felt Yufi smiling at me with a gaze. Although I\u2019m not sure because it was a moment.\u201cPlease don\u2019t turn down the path of learning. All with the Spirit, the will of God and your name. I would like to share with you that Princess Anisphere was not gifted with the protection of the Spirit, but that the Spirit and God recognized her talent. What happened in our country, starting with the covenant we had with the Spirit, and how much time has passed since then? I think. Now is the time for us to walk with change. With the foundations we have walked so far, we want to work with you towards the future. I just hope today will be the first step on that good day\u201dYuffi smiles and cuts the words. At the same time a quiet applause echoes. And the sound of the applause gradually increased, and little by little the sound of the applause wrapped around the venue.\u2026 No, Yufi is amazing. I guess Uffi is sincerely saying what he\u2019s saying right now. That\u2019s why I had something to sound like. I don\u2019t think I can do it a little bit.If I stared at Yufi, I smiled softly as if you noticed my gaze. I knew it was cunning, I thought. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud of where Uffi is now next to me. Because it seemed like it was worth it for me just to have her next door.(True, Yufi is cunning\u2026\u2026 will I try too)After Yufi\u2019s speech, I gave a presentation of the magic props I had brought in, and it ended well. Next, it was a meeting meal, and I actually got zero laughter when I saw the hot water out of the pot and the servings I was using.I want you to think it would be useful. It\u2019s gonna be my feat. You know, I honestly didn\u2019t ask for that. It would be nice if the person who actually used it could make the job easier or something like that.The air in the venue was always calm. To me too, the Ministry of Magic, it also brought practitioners face to face.\u201cPrincess Anisphere, you have a good assistant.\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so much.\u201d\u201cHa! What do you say? The throne has been restored. You\u2019re too modest.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s why you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want to be a king!? Stick a smile in your mouth.\u201cI would be happy to see such a sight. Demonic props spread as a convenient tool to enrich people\u2019s lives. And that\u2019s what I really am.\u201d\u201cIs there no greed or is there\u2026 After all, Princess Anisphere is an interesting person.\u201dI\u2019m interested in bickering, but honestly I want you to stay away for a moment. I\u2019m worried about Yufi. So cut up the story and look for Yufi.I kind of smile when I realize that there\u2019s not enough people at Uffi\u2019s to compare to me. After all, there are people who come together.I managed to get close enough to take Yufi, but my steps were stopped. Because someone came forward to block the path.\u201cPrincess Anisphere, if you like, say hello\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh, what about you?Honestly, I thought it was intrusive, but I smile without even being able to scorn it. That\u2019s like I\u2019ve seen it somewhere. A young man my age, or younger. I get the impression that it looks nervous.On silver hair with habits, a young man with purple eyes with demonic colors smiles and offers his hand to me. I don\u2019t get to see people face to face, so if I remember, I can remember the name right away, but I don\u2019t know.The young man who entered before me smiled and gave me a courtesy to name his name. So I finally understood who he was.My name is Mauritz Chartreuse.\u201cOh, the son of the Secretary of Magic?\u201cYes, the Secretary of Magic is my father.\u201dHe hates me fur. Son of the Secretary of Magic\u2026. Oh, I remember. I thought it was the face I saw somewhere. It\u2019s one of Al-Kun\u2019s surroundings. So this kid is one of those things that got Raini distracted?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I try to smile so that I don\u2019t show it on my face while I don\u2019t really like it and want to talk about it.\u201cThank you very much to Princess Anisphere. And I apologize for the inconvenience.\u201d\u201cAm I what? I don\u2019t have any direct contact with you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about Master Uphilia. My father scolded me for working so hard\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dI smile but I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re thinking. I mean, I can\u2019t see the heart. I can\u2019t grasp the bottom of my belly. I\u2019m not sure how I see Yufi, though I say it in my mouth. Because I don\u2019t feel sincere about words.\u201cI was also the one who suggested this occasion. I managed to think of it as an opportunity to regain my honor. I hope you can remember my name.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you? May I ask why? Weren\u2019t you sincere with Al\u2026 Algardo?I didn\u2019t know you were the son of the Secretary of the Ministry of Magic if you wondered who planned it. This was an unexpected story, to be honest. Besides, he was originally on Al-Kun\u2019s side. I don\u2019t see any motive.\u201cYep. But I also changed my mind\u2026 I wanted to hear it from the princess herself who developed the magic props that were turning away.\u201d\u201cYou want to change your mind, you want me to change my saddle?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. Today is a fixed day. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling my father.\u201dI can\u2019t eat anything. I don\u2019t want to deal with them because my sincerity is hard to grasp. Besides, I want to rendezvous with Uffi, but I\u2019m getting a substantial foothold, so I\u2019m getting annoyed. Let\u2019s just cut to the chase and get some free time here.\u201cReally? I hope you will keep an eye on my actions.\u201d\u201cOh, Princess Anisphere. If you don\u2019t mind giving me a lecture on magic props.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s another chance\u201d\u201cThat would be now. Could you please?\u201dDon\u2019t eat it down long enough, perseverance. I couldn\u2019t help but think of wrinkles between my eyebrows, so I could concentrate on my facial expressions. I don\u2019t know, I even feel like I want to keep Yufi and me apart when I can eat this far down.\u201cThere are other people\u2019s eyes. Please refrain. I\u2019ve already finished my lecture tonight.\u201cDo something there\u2026\u201dPerseverance! Let\u2019s break up the conversation and head to Uffi\u2019s. I don\u2019t know why you suddenly snuck up on me, but I don\u2019t have time to deal with them.It was when I said no again and tried to give my heels back.\u2013 Kiin, and. The high noise echoed from afar.I open my eyes to the sound that everyone in the venue has heard. I know this sound. You can\u2019t possibly know. Because this was developed by me.\u201cIlia!?\u201dIt\u2019s an emergency alert I gave to Ilia. I will immediately begin to act on the alarm sound, which has never been used until this day. But the movement was blocked.\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise now! Gather the people from the venue! Don\u2019t let him out!Mauritz, who was beside him, roughs up his voice and gives instructions. Those who were whispering to each other about what noise would gather together in one place, guided by those who gathered men according to Mauritz\u2019s instructions.I tried to run against the flow and Mauritz grabbed me by the arm.\u201cWhere are you going, Princess Anisphere!\u201cPlease let me go! I have to go!\u201c- Who is it! Who\u2019s here? Princess Anisphere is disturbed! Retain!\u201dHa!? Who says you\u2019re upset!? Yeah, I might know!\u201cOut of the way ah!!\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201dGrab the arm that was being grabbed and slap it with your back throw as you go. Throw away a light Mauritz compared to a knight who is working out or something and shake his arm off.I try to keep going to the exit, but I zero tongue when I see the knights gathering to block the way already.Tap up the dress and remove Mana Blade from the holder that had been planted in the flatulence to cleave the dress. Tie the ends of that torn dress together, and I rush out with all my might without even worrying about my legs getting dewy. Headed for, the window to the venue.\u201cGee ho\u2026\u2026! What are you doing! Will you stop Princess Anisphere!!\u201dMauritz\u2019s anger echoes and the knights move out confused. Really, he\u2019s the only one who can get in the way!?\u201cA, Princess Anisphere!? Where are you going!!\u201d\u201cOut of the way! Retreat!\u201dSome knights have embarked on trying to stop me from moving, but not as intransigent as Mauritz. Paying for a perplexed, stretched arm, as it were, I stuck my body reinforced and crossed my arm towards the window.Keep breaking through the window and your body will be thrown out into the universe. There is some height to the ground, good and fractured as long as it lands, bad beatings can even kill you.\u201cDear Anis!\u201c!? Yuffi!?\u201dYufi jumped in, throwing herself out there in the same way. You\u2019re using magic, you can catch me and hold me at a faster drop rate than I do.Yuffi\u2019s face just says he doesn\u2019t want to be angry, and he yells at me as he catches me.\u201cWhen you\u2019re impotent, at least give me a hand!\u201cHuh, questions later! Uffi, fly me to the outhouse! Let me land!?\u201dYufi nods as she hugs me hard. Calling to the Spirit of the Wind, our bodies fly toward the outhouse like bullets. As the ground moves towards momentum, the membrane of wind unfolded by Uffi acts as a cushion, making sure to jump several times and we come back to the earth.Yuffi stays on his knees and I get up by killing the shock as I get out of Yuffi\u2019s arm and roll. If I looked up, the outhouse was already at the end of my eyes and nose.\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s this all about?So what I saw was a sight to doubt my eyes, to be honest.Raini, who is dropping without force, is bleeding heavily or the smell of blood creeping up his nose. Ilia is holding Raini tight like that. There is no stopping place from that eye, and the tears become zero. That Ilia is crying. Is she wounded, too? It\u2019s lame.\u201c\u2026 answer\u201dAnd the other one.illuminate the person as the light of the moon, hidden in the clouds, poured down. It was those eyes that stood out above all else. A dubious \u201cred iris\u201d that shines in the dark at night.And his upper body, which he opened until he showed his chest, is embedded with a \u201cdemon stone\u201d rooting in his chest.\u201c\u2026 sister\u201dThere, my brother Algardo Bona Palettia stood quietly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: 26\u201c\u2026 you really don\u2019t drive my plan crazy\u201dAl, who told me to throw it away, stares at me as he distorts that red iris. The abomination, the colour of hatred, which is not hidden, is visible in its eyes.I got Al Kun\u2019s gaze. I was about to exhale deeply. But don\u2019t disturb the rhythm of breathing, don\u2019t forget to calm down.Then there was someone more responsive than me. That was Ufi.\u201cDear Algard\u2026\u2026!\u201c\u2026 you too, Uphilia. Really abominable, all aligned.\u201dYufi stares at Al-Kun with a harsh look. Al, who returns his gaze to Ufi like that, his eyes are just as full of hate colors as he sees me.I try to stay calm and grasp the situation. A different colour of iris than before Al Kun, and a demonic stone embedded in his chest.(\u2026 I see.)Keeping Al on guard, he rushes under Ilia quickly. On his knees and peeking into Raini in Ilia\u2019s arms, his chest was wide open and he was in a terrible condition peeking inside.Still breathing, Raini repeatedly breathing shallow. And my eyes wander through the void out of focus.\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026 no\u2026\u2026 princess\u2026\u2026!He bows his head deeply and drips as Ilia tells him to apologize for biting the cry to death.I don\u2019t know the details until how. But enough was enough to convince me that Raini\u2019s demon stone had been taken.Even Ilia is never weak. But they were bad. Anyway, Al is royal. I can\u2019t help it if they take the lead if they surprise me like that. I guess Raini\u2019s demon stone was taken away by Al Kun because it actually happened.\u201c\u2026 Raini, can you hear me?\u201c\u2026 anis, fia\u2026 princess\u2026?React to my voice and Raini gazes at me. Tears zero out of his eyes and wet his cheeks.The expression is distorted in agony and still shakes his throat desperately trying to spin the word.\u201c\u2026 Already, Shiso\u2026 Yes, Ma\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about the apology. I\u2019ll only ask you one thing, if you stay like this, you\u2019ll die.\u201dRaini has no time left. I have more to ask than apologize.\u201cDo you still want to live?Raini remains blurred in my inquiry. However, I still don\u2019t get out of sight.\u201cBecause I help. If you want to live, tell them to help you.\u201dYes, help. I won\u2019t let you die, never.Raini is still struggling to live because she was awakening her demonic stone. Vampires are \u201cresistant to death\u201d magic. So if Raini still doesn\u2019t give up, the road can connect. She\u2019s already given that wisdom.Raini shivers her lips at the inquiry I tried to prompt her to respond. I closed my eyes tightly and found myself putting my strength into my body.\u201c\u2026 I want to. Ma\u2026 not yet\u2026\u201dRaini overlaps words as she gasps and spits blood as she coughs. Ilia firmly supports Raini\u2019s body, which swings without force, to a slightly easier posture.Enough with that word. So I\u2019ll give you more reason to live. Whatever I can give you.\u201cRaini. Then I command you. Live, even if you\u2019re no longer a man. I\u2019ll accept you.\u201c\u2026 anis, fia\u2026 princess\u2026\u201d\u201cNever give up until the end. You wanted to live. I ordered him to live. Then I won\u2019t allow you to defy me.\u201dTake my word for it. Raini blinks a few times and grins like trouble. Then I pulled my lips together and closed my eyes. I get up, making sure Raini\u2019s exhale turns into something bitter.Yufi had set up an arcane shell to alert Alkun. Al didn\u2019t make it slight, he just stared at us quietly.\u201cUfi, heal Raini. Ilaria, now it\u2019s time for both of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 princess\u2026. Yes, I did accept\u201dIllia, who got my word, also opened her eyes to hold her breath for a moment, but immediately stopped crying and wiped her tears. And respond with a more resolute look than usual.On the other hand, Uffi turns his gaze as if confused by my instructions.\u201cDear Anis, in this injury\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. But I can just buy you some time. If Raini could be a complete vampire, he could survive.\u201d\u201cBut no more demon stones\u2026!\u201cIf that was created in Raini from the beginning, you just have to do the same thing again. If that\u2019s not possible, I\u2019ll get it back from Al. Either way, I need time. I said I would help. Then do your best for it. Can you do that, Yufi?\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok\u201dWhen Yufi nodded to me, he immediately knelt beside Raini and prayed to the Spirit to begin exercising his magic. The Spirit sheds light in response to Uffi\u2019s prayer and gathers under Uffi.If it weren\u2019t for this situation, I would have observed it was a fantastic sight. I look sideways and then I turn my gaze to Al Kun.Al didn\u2019t move a step from the spot. I\u2019m just staring at this one with dark eyes.\u201c\u2026 all of it, I wonder if you turned your hand. The exhibition, Mauritz?\u201cI don\u2019t know. If you\u2019re a smart sister, don\u2019t you know everything?\u201cI\u2019m not a god or a spirit. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019ve never seen.\u201dThis situation is too much, and Al doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to hide. Mauritz opened the exhibition to attract me, too, so as to keep me away from Raini.No matter how much you shut your mouth, you can\u2019t keep rumors. Al-Kun found out that I protected Raini and made this plan. I don\u2019t know who the hell told or asked Al, but that\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re here now.\u201c\u2026 this demon stone? I just took the woman there hostage.\u201dLook at Ilia as al-kun points with his jaw. Ilia is taking out Mana Blade as she bites her teeth in remorse and takes her stand.\u2026 to the point of becoming. Did you disable yourself for aiming for Ilia rather than for Raini himself? It was a small number of people who became enemies.Make sure you feel the heel you\u2019re wearing as you circle your thoughts. Yeah, I guess there doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem.\u201c\u2026 Weren\u2019t you fascinated by Raini?\u201cWas.\u201d So I was just trying to put it aside. Because of you, the plan went crazy, so I had to change it. \u201c\u201c\u2026 did you know about the vampire?From Mauritz.That\u2019s him again. I wonder if it would have been painful to gather the materials if he had been the son of the Secretary of the Ministry of Magic. Is that why you got to Raini\u2019s identity?I care there, but it\u2019s not important now. The problem is that Al is trying to secure Raini to become a vampire, and more precisely, to gain the power of a vampire.The Secretary of the Ministry of Magic often snorted at this plan. I don\u2019t know how far Al and the others are talking. All I can say is, this is totally hostile to me.\u201c\u2026 so? To be a vampire?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I had Raini in my hand that I was going to be. Or I didn\u2019t mean to if I didn\u2019t have to. But since you put Ufiria and Raini in your hands, you just decided you had to go hard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rust coming out of you. If you wanted Raini so badly, you could have welcomed him to your concubine.\u201d\u201cRaini\u2019s charm did not make sense to Ufilia. Hence, I was in the way. So I was going to eliminate it and give Raini power by officially welcoming him. My father and even my mother had a math attached to them that they couldn\u2019t resist Raini\u2019s charm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big plan. Were you going to take over the country?\u201cSooner or later, it\u2019ll be mine, so it\u2019ll just get a little quicker.\u201dAs I had a conversation with Al, I took a big sigh of zero. I feel signs of something staring at the bottom of my belly.\u201cEverything went crazy because of your intrusion. Raini was suppressed, and in the meantime you held Uphilia and Raini in your hand.\u201d\u201cWill you stop saying that like I put it in a cage? Tell me you protected him.\u201d\u201cEither is good. The only thing that matters is that my sister is in my way.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? It doesn\u2019t\u201c blow \u201dmuch. Al, is the power of vampires that tame?Only for a moment to my question, Al\u2019s eyebrows jumped. I was wondering if the vampire\u2019s demon stone wanted time to get used to the conversation for a long time, but it looks like you haven\u2019t removed it.That\u2019s natural. Embedding demonic stones is like transplanting someone else\u2019s organs. Raini was born naturally in his body, so he\u2019s familiar with it, and if Al tries to take it in, it won\u2019t be that easy to say how many vampire demon stones have affinity with him.\u201cYou took the Demon Stone from Raini because Raini didn\u2019t obey al-kun?\u201cDo we have to talk that far? You know everything, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you have a head that can make guesses even if you\u2019re not looking directly at it?\u201cYou think it\u2019s about people, Al\u2026\u201d\u201cA monster.\u201dMy lips trembled at the answer returned without getting my hair in. Words that tried to spit out aggressively, but nothing cools them down but thoughts.\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t say it\u2019s clear\u201d\u201cI have to cross you. I needed strength to get over it. Something more than my sister. But I didn\u2019t. Magic talent, politics, schooling, they\u2019re all\u201d what people can do \u201c\u2026!Alkun screams as he grips his fist into all the blood. I guess I look terribly cold in those bloody eyes. The temperature difference would be completely different between Al, who screams, and me, who exhales.This is my sister and brother who split the blood. Oh, what can I say\u2026\u2026\u201cSo you want to do something I can\u2019t even do? Why don\u2019t you kill someone and get the power of the monster?\u201cCountry. I need a country. \u2018Cause that\u2019s what I get, not what you get. I am the King Prince, then I must be the King Prince. Become the next king and stand at the top of the country. Then this power is the power I should have!\u201c\u2026 to rule the country? To say that\u2019s your power?\u2026 Oh, really.\u2013 You\u2019re a bore, Algard.I told him to throw up. Moment after moment, I feel my expression slip away.My thoughts get cold. My emotions get cold. But I didn\u2019t lose my fever. Take it to the back, take it to the back. Feeding the heat of emotion, thoughts flourish.\u201c\u2026 really boring. Am I interrupting you?\u201d I\u2019m sorry you were in such a way that you were interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you pale as to say it\u2019s not funny from the bottom of my heart, it\u2019s not funny.\u201cWhat do you think I was playing madness for? Isn\u2019t it like nobody\u2019s coming any closer? Couldn\u2019t you have imagined that? Algardo.\u201dIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t figure it out anymore. Anger, sadness, I don\u2019t know at the earliest.\u201cCan only people do what they can? Isn\u2019t it obvious, because you\u2019re a person? It\u2019s people who do that to the best of their ability. What do you mean, I\u2019m a monster, so I have to be a monster myself? Who told you when to say that and when to do that? Oh, no. Did you make your own decision? Really? That must have bothered me a lot. You must have suffered. But, Algard, why didn\u2019t you think about the fundamental?Let your body sink just a little. Tilt your center of gravity forward at any time so you can run out.The hand Mana Blade emits a magical light, forming a blade. Clear as a blue sky everywhere, it\u2019s a calm blade of magic. It was as if the undisturbed blade even showed my heart.\u2013 There\u2019s no way you can beat me on the same mound.The ease with which I speak of today\u2019s weather makes me say it all. Al\u2019s expression was severely distorted by my words like that.\u201cSister\u2026!To Al, who distorts his face violently, I nevertheless continued my words to slash and throw away.\u201cYou should have just been a good king. You should have looked like a person everywhere, worried a lot, talked a lot, and went for it with people\u2019s hands. What the hell are you fianc\u00e9es for? What are you doing here? What were you a nobleman, a royal, a parent for? People say it\u2019s a treasure to stack, inherit, and go on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that may have seemed expensive to you, but -!\u201d\u201c- It\u2019s not the king\u2019s eyes, such as cloudy eyes, whose value is no longer visible.\u201dEven Al\u2019s attempted spit objection smashes him in one breath.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Algard. Whether someone else compares you to me, I am what you call a monster. I just wish you\u2019d let me stay a monster. Why did you go up to the same mound? Do you want to compete with me so much? That would be stupid.\u201dI just let him shake his head left or right out of regret. I know my anomaly best.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.That\u2019s why I pulled myself back. Don\u2019t disturb what was sought after for this country. It\u2019s just that I would have been so glad to have been able to sneak up on my dream.\u201cDo you want the monster to rule the country so much?\u201d If no one heals, it\u2019s the people who will suffer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know that? Algardo.\u201dI stare strongly at Al. If I could put all my strength into shattering my back teeth, the sound of a toothpick would reach my ears as well.\u201cShould we rule the country with the power of vampires? Because I can\u2019t imagine what domination by power would produce? How could it be seen if other countries knew about it?\u201cThat\u2019s the power! Then swallow everything, rule everything\u2026\u2026! Yes, that\u2019s why you should be a strong king! It is only by putting everything under control that you will be king!\u201cThat\u2019s a very biased idea. Did the educator do a good job? Or did you run into brainwashing? Speaking of which, you said Raini\u2019s charm didn\u2019t work even if it did. Was that assumption before you? Or did you say you\u2019d already been humiliated?\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t! Don\u2019t look at me with those eyes! Don\u2019t take the price!\u201cIt would be because I would do something cheap to get beat up. I was hoping you would be king and brace your collar around the monster\u2026 you were too high on boulders.\u201dI laughed with my nose at this sight when it was boring.\u201cAt all, your father and mother will mourn. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t have all the children you were born with. You don\u2019t know what happened to the future of the kingdom.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dUnexpectedly, Al asked me in a different tone of voice than before.\u201cIf a good man is to be king, if he calls himself superior! I wish you had been king from the beginning!Al-Kun shakes his arm off and screams. Those eyes won\u2019t let go of me.\u201cI am Prince Wang. It must be Prince Wang. But what is a king? What is a king no one can recognize? An unwanted king is a king for what! All I ever wanted was a\u201d foil \u201cfor Uphilia, who was recognized to lead the country!Al Kun\u2019s cry was dark. It\u2019s ugly enough to spit blood reflexes, like it\u2019s burning and rotting in flames.\u201cI have nothing! There was nothing! I only had what I could give! There\u2019s no such thing as me there! It\u2019s just a king prince, just a king! It\u2019s just me who can\u2019t be anyone!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s what love comes from parents\u201d\u201cLove? Love!? That this is love!? That this is love!? No, can this be love!? It just makes me choose sacrifice to make a wedge called King!!\u201dRun your eyes blood, bite them to the point where they\u2019re about to cut off your lips, and then Al barks.\u201cIf this is love, what are you? Does that mean you\u2019re not in love? Then why are you laughing so much, why are you so free? You are you, sister. It\u2019s only on my sister. Always, everywhere, anytime\u2026\u2026!\u201c\u2026 Algardo\u201d\u201cIs that love, too! You say it would be nice if I were king too! He just wants to be king! Then you don\u2019t need love\u2026! I\u2019ll decide my own way, if you want, I\u2019ll take it and put it in this hand! If you have to swallow everything, it\u2019s not even worth it, like being a person!!\u201d\u2026 I wonder what I look like right now to Al\u2019s cry.Thoughts remain crossed by emotions pushed into the back. There is no fever. Just keep going around. If you have to fulfill it, with one thought.I was so sad that I couldn\u2019t help it, I couldn\u2019t help it. The spinning words are just pale and fruitful.\u201c\u2026 yes. Then you have no choice. If your\u201d Wang Dao 'says so, I will have to speak with\u201d Wang Dao \u201cas well. A king is the foundation of his people, a wedge to exchange his kingdom, and he doesn\u2019t need any there. Maintain peace, so that the contents of the country are not broken, so that they are not exhausted. Yes, I will not deny you that the king is a sacrifice.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You, Father, Mother, this country has pushed me! That\u2019s all I am!!\u201d\u201cIf you knew, you would have been happy. And if you don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t stand as king. I can\u2019t be happy with a king. Ever since I wanted to be individual, I\u2019m sure it will be forever. Because the king only has the happiness of being a king.\u201dI\u2026 I\u2019m probably laughing like I\u2019m in trouble. That\u2019s why Al-Kun\u2019s words strike so hard that he puts a punch in my chest.I guess it hurt. It was so painful, maybe he wanted to cry out. Still not tolerated. Because we are royalty.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get the happiness you wanted from the bottom of your heart with all the alignment. We are.\u201d\u201cSister\u2026! No, Anisphere! Anisphere Win Palettia!!\u201d\u201cIf you say you can\u2019t be the foundation of the country, if you mean to cross me, then let me step on the corpse. Repent yourself, cursed by fantasy that it will not come true forever. We were unhappy from the start. If you still can\u2019t live without swallowing it \u2013 finish it here. That is the mercy from me, who is\u201d inhuman. \u201cAlgardo Bona Palettia\u201dStep in and step forward. At the same time, magic is released from Al Kun\u2019s hands.The battle begins with my brother, who divided the blood. dwelling in the power and will of those who have to be men to one another.\u2013 I remember the warmth of that hand.Failing that, there was no word of reprimand.I was just laughing. He said be careful next time.If successful, the voice of joy echoed.I let my eyes shine, and that guy complimented me.\u201c- Al!It was like a day swinging around.It was a day-to-day that seemed to change dramatically.He was an ignorant child. So I felt happy to know.What he doesn\u2019t know, what he doesn\u2019t know.Repeatedly, we are moving forward. You don\u2019t have to be aware of that.I remember that dazzling light with all this presence.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Al! The next invention is amazing!There is no such thing as a perfect existence. I wasn\u2019t there.It couldn\u2019t be forever. So it\u2019s over.The cut-off has escaped. Yes, I did. And being helpless.\u201c-\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Al\u201dDistance from each other was far away. Everyone tells the shape of a world they don\u2019t want to talk about.Still must be protected. Because that\u2019s what I was born for.I have no choice. I have no choice. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2013 Huh, I looked up at the sky.There\u2019s nobody to be held prisoner of, a vast and magnificent place \u2013 he was there.What crawls through the earth never reaches the sky. But he let it arrive.I\u2019m reminded that I can\u2019t go anywhere, I\u2019m just helpless.It\u2019s dark and buried everywhere. The name becomes just a symbol.Without contents, as desired, unnoticed.\u201c- I\u2019m your sister, Algardo! I\u2019ll call you Al!I remember the warmth of that hand.For your sake, etc. That\u2019s what you told me, I remember the fever that wasn\u2019t deception.I really wanted power. The power to reach that sky.\u2013 So Algardo Bona Palettia can\u2019t be happy forever.For the wingless cannot attain the happiness of dancing freely in the sky.\u2013 So Anisphere Win Palettia can\u2019t be happy forever.Because even if you try to have wings, you lose your freedom tied to the wedge of blood fate and country.If there\u2019s a difference. Those who danced in the sky could choose to put their feet on the earth.And the wingless didn\u2019t even deserve to dance in the sky. That\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: 27\u201cDefine, Start\u201dWords spoken switch my thoughts to those in battle.(Objective Definition, \u201cDestruction of Al Kun\u201d and \u201cRecovery of Raini\u2019s Demon Stone\u201d)Draw out equations to attract the desired answers. However, there is too little information to get to the desired answers.I have not accurately weighed Al-Kun\u2019s threat. So I\u2019m going to do a little research first and attack to gather information.What will Al do and how fast will he react to the attack? How precise and how diverse is magic? What can be accommodated and what will be the decisive hit?As thoughts run glaringly, my body moves apart from thoughts and compels me to tap into a flash by Mana Blade. In contrast, al-kun spins powerful wording to wave his hands down.\u201c\u201d Water cutter \u201c!\u201dAfter the light-emitting phenomenon just before the magical activation, the blade of water approaches me as the orbit of the hand I waved down. Shake through Mana Blade to match the flow of the body that walks through it and fog the blade of water. Adjust the stride to get forward without killing the speed and take steps.Of course, that\u2019s not the end of Al\u2019s attack. He waves his arms like a conductor, one blade of water after another is created, drawing various loneliness and approaching.(I can\u2019t do this while moving. Stop your legs and intercept)My legs stop and stay on the spot. Step on the spot so that you dance, and slap down without leaving a single blade with many impending sword flashes swinging together.Keep going one step, another step and try to pack the distance as you dance. But Al Kun\u2019s movement, which sensed my movement, shows a change.\u201c\u201d Isicle \u201c-\u201cAl knocks his fingers out. I felt the temperature drop all at once mediating the water I cut off and scattered. Almost at the same time as I perceive it, the cold air comes at once as the water that was icy and attached to my body envelops me.\u201c-\u201d Prison. \u201cHuh!Ice Hell, if you say so. The water stretched to cover my body becomes ice and freezes rapidly. If this freezes my body, I kick the ground in momentum and retreat.If you magically stroke the surface of the arm that was starting to freeze, the ice falls to peel off the scales. Make sure you haven\u2019t lost your arm sensation and then get back on your feet.As he lowered his posture as he crawled through the earth and tried to start walking, he saw Al-Kun raise his hand to heaven. Huge water polo balloons are starting to gather up ahead of me with my hands up, and that compresses.\u201c\u201d Waterhammer \u201c!!\u201dThey come at me like compressed water beats a hammer. He drew in his brain an orbit drawn by a hammer in the back of his brain and jumped from a crawling position to a strong force on his feet.Accelerated at the same time as the hammer struck the earth, I earn flying distance and rotate my body so as not to kill momentum at the moment of landing. Mana Blade, held in both hands, turns like a windmill feather, drawing a sword flash and slamming it into Alkun.\u201cHa-ha!?\u201d\u201cChih!!\u201dAl stepping on a dance, but I only finished drawing a scratch that would pull a letter on my arm. Unexpectedly tongue-beating the result, he slips past Al Kun\u2019s side without killing his body\u2019s momentum.My body jumps to slip through the ground, although I took passivity. Momentum was able to kill speed by protruding Mana Blade. As soon as I landed, I turned back to Al Kun, and I saw the blood that Al Kun had shed twitching oddly and going back to my arm so that I could unwind it.(healing\u2026\u2026 no, regenerating? The combination of Al Kun\u2019s magic and vampire traits. Is Al Kun\u2019s aptitude for water and ice? So it\u2019s compatible to use blood as a medium?Observe calmly and try to gather information. On the other hand, Al is staring at me with burning emotions in his eyes. If you wave, a magically activated emission phenomenon accompanies the orbit of that hand before an ice column is formed.\u201c\u201d Icicle lance. \u201cHuh!One, the ice-column spear released again at a deviation from the other, is released to block my exit path.(Can you beat it all off? Can you go? \u2013 Hypothesis, established. Run Now!!)I fly one step back and knock it off with a blade stretched out with magic on Mana Blade.The moment I kick the ground and fly, Al also comes forward. The hand overflows from the wound, and the blood that was covered with a sore lid reshapes in the hand, forming a red spear.\u201cAnisfiaaaaaaa!!\u201dPlace the spear in both hands on the upper stage, and al-kun swings it down so as to slap it. The stretched blade of Mana Blade is restored to normal selfishness by spreading magic.Recirculate the blow of the red blood spear and take the side steps as you go. Fly beside Alkun and jump right into Algard\u2019s belly with the iterative instructions to kick in.\u201cGu\u2026\u2026!\u201cOr\u2026 Huh!Al Kun\u2019s stomach was just hard to say if something was being planted, and he could have hurt his leg without physical strengthening. Though slightly surprised by that fact, we distance ourselves again.Al Kun\u2019s face was full of bitterness. I couldn\u2019t breathe knowing it didn\u2019t affect me at all. It\u2019s already a complete demon, like this. He said it wasn\u2019t human endurance.\u201cDon\u2019t lick\u2026\u2026 ugh!\u201cHuh!?\u201dIt was a flash of relief. Al was starting to have a flat face when he wondered if there was any flow of magic moving.\u201c\u2026 amazingly tough. That\u2019s the power of vampires?Al-Kun answered my query with nothing and came with his hands turned. A magical precursor to the light emitting into the air again, now it was the bullet of water that approached me.\u201c\u201d Water Barrett \u201c\u201dI tried to cut off the impending bullet\u2026\u2026 I had a bad feeling. A sense of crisis runs all the way through my back like thunder.Follow your instincts and avoid twisting your face on the verge of landing. The bullet of water flowing backwards sank into the earth, sounding unwillingly heavy.\u201cI know about your weakness.\u201dPale Al Kun unfolds his magic. One, two, three and a bullet of water floated, and I could see the debris mixed in there.Look at that. I accidentally zero my tongue. My weakness, the endurance of demonic props. An attack with heavy mass is something I need to avoid. If you do poorly, Mana Blade could be destroyed.\u201cI can\u2019t use magic. So rely on demon props. But demon props can\u2019t be used if they break. It\u2019s already a well-known fact that your magic tools are vulnerable to physical shocks.\u201d\u201cIf you think only demonic props are my hand tag, drop one hand.\u201d\u201cThen let me prove it!\u201cEven if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201dA bullet of rubbled water approaches me as I begin to walk. It\u2019s like rain.(Preventing rain with a sword will not come true. Mana Shields is no more useful under this circumstance than there is a mixture of debris. Avoidable with increased speed? \u2013 Not executable)You can\u2019t avoid a bullet pouring out of time so as to block the way.(- So here\u2019s the deal)The next moment Al opened his eyes. Perhaps you sensed my magical movement.But it\u2019s late. \u2013 I sucked my breath out loud and \u201cI could yell.\u201d\u201c\u201d \u2013 \u2013 Huh!! \u201cNormal people had throats crushed, no, it was a growl that couldn\u2019t be structurally put out.Yes, that\u2019s like a dragon roar. It sounds like a shockwave that shivers the air and knocks out the rain.(There was a hint. If vampire fangs, demon stone body changes are possible, even I can theoretically do it)Dragon\u2019s lung vitality and screaming by his throat. That is equal to the intimidating roar of the dragon itself. That\u2019s where I shock by putting magic on it.Al was distracted by an attack he didn\u2019t expect. And a gap was created into that nostalgia. Mana Blade\u2019s sword flashes to make sure she doesn\u2019t miss this opportunity, slashing and ripping Alkun to shreds.\u201cGuh!\u201cMana Blade, Limit Release!Mana Blade, the opposite of the swinging out Mana Blade, receives my speech recognition and unwraps herself and takes another form.The blade of magic unfolds like a nail. The nail length is not as long as the blade, each thin. There he forcefully taps into his magic and turns his three nails into something tough.I don\u2019t mind the excess magic leaking out like purple electricity, and I slammed that blow into al-kun.\u201cOveredge\u2026\u2026 ugh!\u201c Dragon Crow \u201dHuh!!\u201dA claw sword blow rips Al off his body as he chooses through the wound that was cut into slashes first. And Al-Kun turned to the shock, and his feet departed from the earth.But the shock of a full blow strikes me as a recoil, too. Distance yourself from Al to mislead that recoil.The light disappears from Mana Blade, who unfolded the nail sword, and there is no response. Confirm it before inserting it back into the holder of the thick crotch.(\u2026 it is difficult to use it again)Time must be set aside for reuse to be used to prevent breakage with excessive output on boulders. Besides, I don\u2019t even know when it will break if I don\u2019t take care of it once I use it. Literal swords of all blades, but their power is immense.A good amount of blood flows from Al\u2019s body. I can see the damage taken from the area where the blood is throwing up from my mouth is deep.Still, Al won\u2019t fall again. Blood becomes a red sore lid to block the wound again, stopping the flowing blood from weighing.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026 ha!I guess it just drains your strength and magic. Al\u2019s breathing is rough and his eyes remain bloody running.\u201cWhat\u2019s up\u2026 I\u2019m not down yet\u2026! You\u2019re not calling!!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cNot really\u2026\u2026! You want to say you don\u2019t have to deal with them, but you do!! You said you\u2019d help Raini! If so, you want this demon stone!?\u201dThe demonic stone embedded in Al Kun\u2019s body was about to be buried in the back so that it could be further rooted. So much so that it\u2019s going to bury in your body as it is.\u201c-\u2026 I\u2019m bored\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?Al raised an eyebrow. A kind of inquiry that asks what the hell it means.Asked, I was \u2013 I was just vain enough to stop hanging up. I know perfectly well that my mind is going to be empty. So it was an enquiry that came out of my mouth.\u201cI hear it\u2019s boring, Al.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201cYou\u2019ve got the power, and you\u2019ve taken my blow. Al doesn\u2019t seem to have a lot of fun.\u201d\u201cSo what are you saying?Al Kun hits his emotions with a pointy voice at me as he seems irritated. Plus my empty heart started to regain heat like it caught fire.That was something I\u2019ve been sequestering ever since this battle began\u2026. Ugh, it\u2019s a lie. This is an emotion that has been going on for a long, long time.\u2013 It\u2019s the emotion I\u2019ve always had with Al.\u201cLook forward to it, Al.\u201dI\u2019m not sure myself that made me cry. I don\u2019t think I wanted to cry. Anger has passed, neither hateful. It\u2019s just an empty heart burning. I thought there was nothing to burn.\u201cThis is what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? Yet Al, you seem bored. I don\u2019t even laugh, I\u2019m just angry and screaming that I don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s crazy. Al, aren\u2019t you doing what you wanted to do right now?If this battle has always been what Al wanted.How can I only feel Al\u2019s empty anger?That makes me sad. So sad that I feel that nothingness is created in my heart.\u201cLaugh more, you\u2019re angrier, you\u2019re sadder, you\u2019re looking forward to it\u2026. Otherwise, you can\u2019t even fly this way. You\u2019ve always wanted to do this, haven\u2019t you? You wanted to compete with me and try to win, didn\u2019t you? If you\u2019re doing what you wanted, you have to laugh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what, the rationale. Oh, I am! Yes! I wanted to cross you! I wanted to prove I had something better than you! That\u2019s why I keep trying!\u201cI can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a consultation, \u2019cause I can tell you I\u2019m better. I\u2019m not even willing to lose to you.\u201dBuy words for sale. My heart is about to burn in anger, but my fever doesn\u2019t last.Sad, vain, painful, hard. All those emotions get ahead of me and the back of my eyes get hot.\u201c\u2026 hey? Now, Al, you live the way you wanted from the bottom of your heart? I don\u2019t think I can breathe.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cIt looks spicy, Al. Hey, Al. If you can\u2019t laugh here, you can\u2019t laugh even if you beat me\u2026\u201d\u201cFunny! I laugh! I thought I had a better place than you! He said he could protect what I wanted to protect!!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that just reassuring? Can you say that you\u2019ve fulfilled your wish? \u2013 It\u2019s not, Al. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\u2013 It\u2019s painful, Al. Watching you is so hard. [M]\u201cEnjoy your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Enjoy,\u201dAl opened his eyes to my spitting words. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m surprised, angry, or just being taken aback. I don\u2019t know anything about Al anymore.\u201cIf you can\u2019t enjoy it, it doesn\u2019t make sense, it doesn\u2019t make sense. In the end, Al, you just become king. I\u2019ll be a boring tyrant no different than a king of decorations, just wielding my powers. Or do you want to enjoy the killing? Is abuse the happiness for you?\u201cWhy bother asking such a thing!? Have pity!?\u201d\u201c- If you don\u2019t want to be pitied, behave yourself!The fever of the heart that I finally regained, the color of that emotion is not anger. It\u2019s a void that can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s so empty that you can\u2019t even color it. That\u2019s why I have to scream. I can\u2019t do anything to Al-Kun anymore without burning this void.\u201cIf it\u2019s not fun, think about living happily ever after! If you don\u2019t want to be tied up, think about living free! Isn\u2019t that why you chose? Trying to cross me! Don\u2019t enjoy it, what\u2019s left over me? After all, it\u2019s just the cold crown, I don\u2019t know!?\u201dAl distorted his expression so that he could be poked in the void by my cry. My legs step back, as if pushed by my momentum.I took a step forward to pack that remote distance. My legs are so heavy. If you don\u2019t want to put it forward, it\u2019s like your nerves are screaming.analogy, still. I take a strong step forward. Even if it is a completely missing step to fill this distance of disconnection.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel anything right now? You just regret it? Are you just scared? Really? Well, I\u2019m sure you were scared of me. That was scary. You\u2019re making me mean it, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t think anything of yourself? I got it for sinning or throwing it all away, but what I\u2019ve got is so empty!?\u201dGrab your chest with one hand. It\u2019s too heavy and it\u2019s a painful emotion to spit out. When would I have tasted such carelessness?\u2013 Yes, it\u2019s enough to compare it to despair when you know you can\u2019t use magic. That was the worst, worst fact of my life.I had another taste of despair that I thought for a moment that I would turn down my life. Then there\u2019s no way your heart won\u2019t die.It\u2019s the same world with magic, but it can\u2019t breathe how magic can\u2019t be used. That\u2019s all I was desperate for. Yet Al is! You\u2019ve given me the same amount of despair!\u201cLook forward to it! You\u2019ve grown stronger! Any history, any reason! I\u2019m going out with you! I\u2019m still\u2026 your sister!! Your only sister!!\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.You can hate me. You can hate me. Because that\u2019s all I could give you anymore. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been fooling myself about.But the truth is. \u2013 I\u2019ve never forgotten the day Al took your hand.He was an important brother. He was a cute little brother. I was the one who had to protect you. He\u2019s the one who realized I couldn\u2019t protect him and let go of his hand.Please, at least be healthy. Even such prayers were betrayed. I ended up ruining Al\u2019s life because of me. You have to. I can\u2019t live!\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my life and lived it! To shape the magic I\u2019ve always dreamed of! I don\u2019t care how much magic you can\u2019t use, no matter how desperate they poke at you! It was fun, ever!!\u201dIf you wish no more to come true, let\u2019s burn everything down. This nothingness, despair, everything that was prayer.Now I leave nothing to think about. This may be the last time. I have no reason to hold my thoughts. The royal wall is an unnecessary title for us anymore.\u201cIn such a boring battle! Beat me! So Al is satisfied!? Come and ask for more, slap him as much as your emotions think! You\u2019ve always regretted it! You\u2019ve been asking for it! Here and now! Don\u2019t enjoy this fight! Don\u2019t be happy! Don\u2019t be sad! When do you say you think anything but anger!?\u201dIf you\u2019re saying I\u2019m the one who emptied your life\u2026 I\u2019ll burn it all.\u201cIf you say there\u2019s only anger, I\u2019ll remind you. I remember that you didn\u2019t want to remember. \u2013 Because I\u2019m your sister. This is the only way I can be your sister!!\u201dI just screamed to my heart. I don\u2019t think about the feelings of the recipient, just the ego itself.To my cry like that, Al was just like not knowing what to look like. Good, that\u2019s good, Al. You\u2019re on your own, I know.\u2013 Still, you can only live on your own. Curse me. That\u2019s fine.\u201c\u2026 what, that. Are you trying to tell me you\u2019ll forgive me?\u201cYou can\u2019t forgive me, idiot! Now that Al is gone, I\u2019m the next one to have the right to inherit the throne!? I\u2019m not playing witch mountain games, I\u2019m not doing anything stupid to you that won\u2019t even beat me!! Baka! Idiot! Idiot at last!!\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou always wanted to do this!? Did you ever know about royalty, determination, destiny or anything like that! Just talk as you wish! Just be free to hope! Do what you want! Don\u2019t be patient! Isn\u2019t that what you wanted!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 that was unforgivable\u201dBite your teeth off by the time you\u2019re about to hear a toothpick, and Al squeals like a groan. You don\u2019t know that!\u201cYou can\u2019t forgive me! But it\u2019s too late! That\u2019s how you know!? Then you\u2019ll have to laugh already! Then laugh! Laugh at all the nasty things you\u2019re about to push on me! Happy to! You should do that!\u201cNo, that would be too rampant!?\u201d\u201cUgh, baka!!\u201d\u201cWhat was that earlier!? Kids!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s a child! I\u2019m just a kid! Kids are good!! That\u2019s why you fight!! You\u2019re doing it now!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 fight\u2026?What are you talking about? and al-kun blinked his eyes. Oh, I really couldn\u2019t even do this to you. I wonder how we could only be like this.\u201cIt\u2019s a fight, it\u2019s just a fight. This.\u201d\u201c\u2026 fights,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no reason to fight! This is, this is \u2013 revenge\u2026! Me! I wanted revenge on you\u2026!Revenge, huh? Oh, yeah. This is revenge for Al. I kept taking everything away from myself, if I didn\u2019t have to be anything, it\u2019s just revenge against the royal family that gave me the curse of being king.\u201c- But know it or not!\u201c\u2026 hey, what the hell are you! Why don\u2019t you always think about the reaction from around you? That\u2019s why you\u2019re called Kiteretsu! Yet they say I\u2019m good except for magic, they compare me and you know how I felt!?\u201d\u201cI just found out! And I don\u2019t care!! It was Al who would be king!!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be king of decorations!!\u201d\u201cThen you should have been the king you wanted to be!!\u201d\u201cMy sister was the one who should have been king! You\u2019re better than me, and you have to inherit just to say I\u2019m a boy! Isn\u2019t that irrational!!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s good! Al!\u201d\u201cYes, no!\u2026 No, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s different!? What are you talking about!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weirder for Al to deny it even though he admitted he wanted to, you idiot!\u201cOh what the hell are you\u2026!! What do you want!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s a fight. It\u2019s just a fight!\u201cIsn\u2019t that a fight problem?\u201dAl-kun looked at me with an incredible look on his face. Besides, I think I accidentally got a crying look on my face.Because the reaction\u2026 seems too \u201cnormal.\u201d I guess Al couldn\u2019t float all this time.One day, memories come back to my brain when I was pulling my reluctant al-kun hand. We were still sisters and brothers today.\u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore! Details!\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter!?\u201d\u201c- Where is the problem more than accepting the grievances of a suffering family member!?\u201d\u2013 Hey, Al. I wish I could still pull your hand.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you because I\u2019m royal! There\u2019s no point in saying it anymore! If you throw it away, I\u2019ll throw it away! That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to face me! If you want to fight, say so!! If you say you are unhappy, say my best to show it!!\u201d\u2013 I can hear that guy (sister) scolding me.I got it so I could slap the words. I clog the words. Emotions twist up and spread to every corner of your body.I don\u2019t know if I want to cry or if I\u2019m mad anymore\u2026. and lost power all at once. I couldn\u2019t help it, I wanted to laugh.\u201c\u2026 now you are.\u201d\u201cYeah, now it is.\u201dThat guy (sister) has a crying look on his face. You must have been angry the whole time. My anger is still not gone. But that wasn\u2019t pure anger anymore.\u201c\u2026 if I could have heard that word sooner, I would have\u201d\u201cIf I had conveyed this word quickly, I would have\u201dOh\u2026 it\u2019s like a mirrored word.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave now.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t back off.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be a bastard.\u201d\u201cNo one.\u201d Apologize to Raini, fool. \u201c\u201cMy sister is the one. If we keep this up, Raini\u2019s gonna die, okay? Can you apologize then?\u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t let you die! If you break it, Raini will be the same! If you\u2019re guilty of the same crime, both succeed and lose! Later, I am royal!! My orders should take precedence!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 terrible reason. Really, terrible reason\u2026 makes me cry\u201dI laughed as I shed my floating tears. I was laughing.At the earliest, I was too sad, too angry, but the laughter came in and I couldn\u2019t help but\u2026 I thought it was fun.You\u2019re an idiot, I thought. I do fools from what to what. Both myself and the person in front of me (my sister). That\u2019s not the case, but still\u2026 we\u2019re trying to have a \u201cfight\u201d.\u201cHey, sister.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWill you die?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s no choice.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\u201cHave a fight!\u201cShall we continue!\u2013 Oh. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing left, and it\u2019ll be a fight that won\u2019t benefit.Let go of everything you had and just slap your emotions as you wish. I wanted you dead, I thought. From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to beat this irrational incarnation to pieces.Still good. I guess this irrational sister says. This guy is too prodigious, incomprehensible, and yet oddly sharp to pierce his mind.\u201cI hate you!! Sister!!\u201dI\u2019ve always hated it.I hated you more than anything and couldn\u2019t help but notice you.You lived your days to the point where you didn\u2019t care about anything else, you were hateful, jealous, and envious from the bottom of your heart.I remember one day smiling. When would it have been a smile? That\u2019s the face my sister is laughing at. Really, this guy hasn\u2019t changed anything or anything for a long time.I couldn\u2019t wait to hate it, but it seemed to spit out without starving.This guy says he hates you. He always wanted to beat this guy up. This awareness lightens my mind above all else, and I am reminded that there is nothing ahead of me.I just couldn\u2019t stop laughing from slipping down my throat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: 28The movement has changed, he said. Ilia thought watching the sight.The rough moves were intact, but the battle had changed its nature. A blow that could take each other\u2019s lives is flying and my sister and brother, who shared blood like dancing and dancing, are bumping into each other. Each other, just a serious look at the other is consistent.One by one, the water-mediated magic played out by Algardo brightens in the light of the moon. It is the anisphere that scatters its brilliance. A magical light filled body in its hands cleaves the darkness at night.It\u2019s like the light is dancing and dancing. It even seems as if they are having fun dancing while risking their lives in it. That seems beautiful somewhere, and I can\u2019t cut it enough to tighten my chest.Ilia\u2019s been watching Anisphere\u2019s back. Just look forward, my back that\u2019s going to fly away somewhere if I\u2019m not reaching out. a back that would be gone from sight if someone hadn\u2019t fastened it.\u201c\u2026 was I just going to follow you\u201dAnispheric screams had also reached Ilia\u2019s ears. She always said she didn\u2019t want to be king. I know the intention. There is also love for Algard, my brother.But how much was my understanding? Even though I know the ironlessness of the Anisphere, I just seriously see Anisphere facing Algard and confronting him with his life.Is this the separation between royalty and nobility? Was there something between those two that could still only be held by royalty because they were my sister and brother? My chest was painful if I thought so. I can see that back so far away right now.\u201c\u2026 Dear Uphilia, Miss Raini\u2026\u201dI shouldn\u2019t, he said. Ilia shifts her gaze to Ufiria and Raini, who are dedicated to treatment by shaking her neck from left to right.He places his hand on Raini\u2019s chest so that Uphilia overlaps his hands and continues to exercise his magic while even sweating. Even though the pale light shines to cover the wound, the wound doesn\u2019t seem to disappear.(From the tip of the pour\u2026 like the bottom is missing\u2026!If he was a concurrent wizard, magic was consumed to such an extent that it was not surprising that he was running out of magic. It is only with the qualities of Uphilia that we are still being treated.But still, it\u2019s not enough to connect and stop Raini\u2019s life. There is no way to bury a life that falls, and it has not been a fundamental solution.Raini\u2019s breathing is getting smaller and smaller. His eyes, which were closed in agony, open thinly, wandering through the void.\u201c\u2026 Yufi, Leah\u2026 Dear\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Raini, don\u2019t talk!\u201c\u2026 did you hear that\u2026?\u201c\u2026 what is it!Uphilia returns her words in frustration with Raini, who suddenly speaks of the question.I would like to say that I do not want you to wear out your wasted health. However, it is possible that the person is speaking in an attempt to remain conscious. Then I respond with a loud voice when it is better to call.\u201c\u2026 Dear Algard and Princess Anisphere\u2026 I don\u2019t know, you know\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, figure it out?\u201cMe too, because I was a civilian\u2026 a nobleman\u2026 and it was hard\u2026 and I\u2019m sure those people were\u2026 heavier\u2026 but like me\u2026 you gave up, you couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201dRaini mouths her thoughts intermittently, shaking her lips.Raini had also heard the voices of Anisphere and Algard who had exchanged during the battle. It was empathy and voidness that came to Raini\u2019s chest when they heard the two words. \u2013 And it was a vision.\u201cI can\u2019t help myself\u2026 I can\u2019t do anything about it, so give up\u2026 but those people\u2026 they\u2019re not\u2026 they\u2019re not, so only in that way\u2026 can they scream\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 screaming?\u201cI scream\u2026 like I\u2019m giving you\u2026 I think\u2026 to me\u2026\u201dWhile continuing to treat Raini, Uffi shifts his gaze sideways into the battle between Anisphere and Algard.I can see Algard waving his arms and trying to create countless blades of water to flex them away like whips, and Anisphere trying to push them forward while pressing and slashing the impending blades of water.Without roughing up each other\u2019s voices, they just head straight to overthrow the other. Can you see that sight screaming?Raini\u2019s senses were empathetic and hard on Ufiria. I know you\u2019re in pain. But is that how you behave like a scream? I didn\u2019t think so very much for Ufilia.\u201c\u2026 if you suffer too much\u2026 hands up\u2026 I want to\u2026 scream\u2026 squirm\u2026 on the contrary\u2026 you can\u2019t say anything\u2026 really\u2026 if you suffer\u2026 even though you can\u2019t stand it\u2026 you will endure it\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Raini\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe both\u2026 endure too much\u2026 we try too hard\u2026 but if you don\u2019t\u2026 we\u2019ll have trouble\u2026 because I know\u2026\u201dTears creep into Raini\u2019s eyes. Grab a fist with the help of your body, which should be losing its strength.\u201c\u2026 oh, so,\u2026 sorry, sorry\u2026! Please, but\u2026 yes, I do\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease? What?\u201cBlood\u2026 dammit, come on\u2026 I\u2019m ready\u2026 I\u2019m ready\u2026 I\u2019m ready\u2026!Fumi Uphilia realizes. The color of Raini\u2019s red iris seemed darker. Uphilia is breathtaking in the colours of the person. This is nothing more than the ongoing vampirization of Raini.\u201cAre you going to be able to? Your demon stone\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Demon Stone\u2026 of the Spirit, perverted\u2026 now to me\u2026 Master Uphilia poured me\u2026 I have the power\u2026 to use, use this\u2026! Play, let\u2026!Raini repeats, even as he is interrupted. What did she understand what she glimpsed by approaching the abyss of death? Uphilia doesn\u2019t know that. But I thought if I needed blood, I couldn\u2019t let go.\u201cThen give me my blood\u201d\u201cIlia\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy end, I\u2019ll put it on. Miss Raini, do you mind?\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not totally a vampire yet\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Even if you become a vampire. If you can help the princess with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 eh\u2026. right. \u2026 So, Uphilia, Dear\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cYou\u2026 you do what you want to do\u2026 come\u2026!What I want to do.Yes, Raini told me and Uphilia forgot me. I wonder what I want to do and what I want to do.Raini lays her hands over Ufiria\u2019s hand, which was magically continuing to heal. He is gripped with a hand painted with blood, and his hand gets dirty with Raini\u2019s blood. Still, Raini lifted Ufiria\u2019s hand away from herself.\u201cEveryone\u2026 clumsy, too\u2026 so at least\u2026 honestly\u2026! Oh, ho, ho!\u201cMiss Raini, I\u2019m coming.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 muggu!?\u201dThe moment he coughed, Raini\u2019s hand left Ufiria\u2019s hand powerless, and Ilaria re-held Raini as she scratched it, blocking its lips with her own lips.On his lips he sees a chewed wound, from which overflowing blood is poured into Raini. Suddenly Raini moves for a moment with his eyes round, but is suppressed by Ilia to seal his movements.With his eyes closed, Ilia suppresses Raini without letting go. Every second, two seconds and time goes by, Raini\u2019s body jumps into small pieces, and her eyes narrow to bitterness open. Pushing Ilia to peel off, Raini turns herself against the bow.\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026!! I want to be there\u2026 heh\u2026!!\u201dThe unpleasant sound of meat and meat being forced to connect sounds. The wound that was on Raini\u2019s chest disappears beautifully and refreshingly, and I see sharp dog teeth that cannot be hidden in Raini\u2019s rough, exhaling mouth.\u201c\u2026 Is it a success?\u201cHuh\u2026 I want to be, but\u2026 oh, really\u2026 I was\u2026 lying, this\u2026 why Master Algard\u2026 move\u2026 stupid\u2026!? is\u2026 come, and no\u2026!!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re all right, you don\u2019t seem to have a problem.\u201dTo Ilia wiping her lips like nothing had happened, Ufiria finally resumed the movement she had stopped.Even if the wound heals, Raini is about to twist her face in agony to see if it hurts where the wound appeared. Watch Uphilia while Ilia suppresses Raini like that.\u201c\u2026 Dear Uphilia. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026 can\u2019t you please? I don\u2019t even have the nerve to crack it in that boulder and let it in. I don\u2019t even have words to follow. Besides, I can\u2019t leave Miss Raini. That\u2019s how the princess ordered it. If that\u2019s what I can do, then I can do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I am\u201d\u201cWhen Miss Raini lived, she fulfilled that promise. Protect it and I\u2019ll do what I have to do. \u2026 What do you want to do? Dear Uphilia,\u201dIf Ilia asks me, I can\u2019t find an answer. I can\u2019t even think of any words to follow from there.At that time, something disgusting sounded and took my gaze away. It was such an inorganic sound, like something smashed.Ahead of Uphilia\u2019s gaze, there lay the remains of a crushed Mana Blade in space, away from Anisphere\u2019s hands.\u201cHuh\u2026!He\u2019ll do it! I can\u2019t believe Mana Blade took one!The blade of water that swells around Al-Kun flexes like a whip. The number is four, which at first glance looks just water but weighs less than usual. He was well poked at the point that he was vulnerable to physical shocks, a weakness of Mana Blade. But it still doesn\u2019t count to be crushed\u2026\u2026!\u201cHa ha! Ha ha ha!! crushed! It\u2019s crushed!!\u201dLook at that. Al is laughing. Wow, I\u2019m so sorry. Al, I\u2019ve been up to my magic arm all at once in this short time. No, you\u2019re not. It\u2019s refining what was there. They don\u2019t use magic in the form of magic anymore.He\u2019s switching to a physical subject to suit me. Actually, this is hard. Al Kun\u2019s water is heavy. It\u2019s too much of a burden to beat it off. But all my methods of attack are melee attacks. When I can seal this, I don\u2019t have the next hand.All that\u2019s left is Mana Blade, who uses the overedge to stay anxious. This could crush the meeting as soon as possible. I can\u2019t use it for an attacker ahead of me from here.\u201cWhen they use magic on boulders, it\u2019s tight\u2026! I mean, if you can handle it so well, go ahead and eat it!\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Uphilia next door, that could have been possible too!\u2026 Was there me compared as a royalty and Uphilia compared as a wizard?Yeah, I already said I didn\u2019t have the specifications to see someone anywhere I stood.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense now that I realize it.\u201d\u201cNot at all\u2026\u2026!\u201cI wish I could have you like this!!\u201dDodge the approaching water blade as it kicks the ground. I don\u2019t have the means to intercept it, so I even dodge it thoroughly and run around Al Kun\u2019s perimeter to see it, but I\u2019m coming after it.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have said if it weren\u2019t for the magic props! Let me see it, sister! If you still have your hands! If you don\u2019t see it, if you don\u2019t try to get over it, it doesn\u2019t make sense!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 you said that. I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201dConcentrate your magic around your body on your back engraving. Your body\u2019s fever keeps rising and your heartbeat is engraved as if you had another heart on your back.\u2013 Wake up.Wake up the \u201ccurse\u201d. What I imagine is magic to fire iron, like will to pull the trigger.Moments, my body is attacked by the illusion as if it were boiling. Never really boiling, rather it is the soul that is burned with heat to the point of boiling. The illusion is created by the magic spitting out of its soul all over its body.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\u201dRaise your voice to squeeze. There\u2019s a voice in the back of my brain. A hissing creeping into your ears begins to sound like it penetrates your cerebral cord.Look, if you want to eat, eat. It\u2019s nothing anymore, it\u2019s not me. Part of me. Eat as much as you like, and ramble as much as you like. And the resounding sounds create magic that cannot be embodied in people.\u2013 \u201cThe fictional Dragon Devil\u2019s Heart (Dragon Heart).\u201d The back hand that evokes the curse engraved on this body through engraving and refluxes the \u201cDragon Magic\u201d that generated it to me.Bring my magic into the water and let the magic pass through my body that is not my own. Originally inexhaustible, but \u201ccursed\u201d by the dragon. The real thing that the body takes, my only back hand.My body is degenerate filled with dragon magic. If you can\u2019t fit in people, you can change. That\u2019s what they wanted, so it\u2019s inevitable.I am a dragon, be a dragon in the shape of a person. Much like vampirization, but different. If you say that\u2019s a transformation or a mutation, this one\u2019s a perversion. So the dragon\u2019s magic can only be used \u201cwithout taming the body\u201d. Otherwise, the dragon could really drink it.\u201cEven if you die, don\u2019t resent me!!\u201dMy tongue doesn\u2019t turn oddly. The intoxication is as if you drank a glass of fire alcohol. Still, I don\u2019t just let go of consciousness.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Kick the ground with momentum and jump into Al Kun\u2019s nostalgia. at a rate that does not even react the water blade. The sound of the wind passing by and the body reaching your ears more than that. The bones, the muscles, the sound of my soul burning.A blow that changes all of that heat to power can be a special hit.\u201cGu, ha!?\u201d\u201cOh man!!\u201dStrike the clenched fist with all your strength into al-kun. Every time I crushed something, or I felt like I crushed it.Still, I won\u2019t stop. Crush, crush, crush. flesh, mind, even myself.Break it, break it, break it, still disconnect it.(How many seconds to keep\u2026!? out of time, before\u2026 crush\u2026!!)I can\u2019t give you more magic. Even if my own magic is blocked, the dragon\u2019s magic remains in my body.If I can spit this out, I have no aftermath. So I have to make up my mind here. I can\u2019t help it. \u2013 Even if that kills al-kun.\u201cNow you are! Over y!!\u201dGrab Al-kun with one hand and pull his fist so he can squeeze his bow. Twist your body, feet to hips, shoulders to arms as you go. Al-Kun and I met each other in an attempt to tap our fists into Al-Kun using the power of our whole body.Oh, there\u2019s nothing I can do. He looked like he\u2019d given up like that, but relieved. Oh, don\u2019t kill me with this. Some sober thought proves that definition. Al will be crushed and killed by me here\u2026\u2013 And it wasn\u2019t the feel of soft meat that I hit, it was the feel of hard iron.Al is blown away by the impact of the beating. And likewise, \u201cSomeone who broke in between Al and me rolls.\u201d Around the universe, what pierced the earth was familiar.Not only did he say he had served, but it was Uffi\u2019s arcane shell that broke from half and fell to the ground. And it was Ufi who entered between Al Kun and me, and she gets up with her limbs on the ground, shaking her whole body.\u201c\u2026 so\u201dAt first with a small voice. But I raise my face firmly and stare at this one with my eyes moistened with tears.\u201cIt\u2019s a fight! What are you going to do when you kill me? We are both big idiots!! If no one is going to stop me, I\u2019ll have to!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yu, Phi\u201dHe cracked me in, to take a blow that would have killed me instantly if it had hit me. Even the arcane shell in the corner was crushed, and the other person, even if he was a former fianc\u00e9 who scorned himself, put himself up and saved his life.Dragon magic falls out of the body, fatigue and intense pain strike the body. Continue to stand with your teeth bitten hard in the face of wanting to fall as-is.Blown up, Al has no sign of moving with his body spread out over the big letters. Towards Al Kun like that, I go close to dragging my feet.\u201c\u2026 pissed off, I got it\u201dWhen I speak, I turn to me the gaze that was pointing at the sky. From the edge of his mouth, Alkun was vomiting blood, and there seemed to be no standing force left of what his fingers would occasionally pick and move.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s totally unusual. There is no hand or foot in the seriousness of those who wanted to cross, and lives are saved by the woman who should have abandoned them. It\u2019s a good place to be funny.\u201d\u201c\u2026 better dead?Al smiled lightly at my inquiry. It\u2019s like a transparent, disappearing look.\u201c-\u2026 I\u2019ve always wished I hadn\u2019t been born\u201d\u201c-\u2026 so-so\u201dJust speak up and the pain runs on your body. Still, I didn\u2019t want to stop talking to Al.\u201c\u2026 Al. I hate to compliment you, but I did everything I could.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ah\u201d\u201cIt hurts so much, this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt hurt me too\u2026\u201d\u201cThat hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cThat hurts.\u201d\u201cBut I won. Look. Like I said, right?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Ah\u201dAl puts his hands crossed so as to block his gaze. Bite your teeth off and your teeth just crumble.\u201cHuh, huh, huh, huh \u2013 huh!!\u201dThe cry echoes. Makes you feel desperate, sounds like that.Al can\u2019t beat me after all. I never would have been the winner I wanted.If it\u2019s the same mound, you\u2019ll never lose. I just tapped that fact.Scream, scream, just scream, keep screaming\u2026 slowly Al\u2019s voice goes down.\u201c\u2026 sister\u201d\u201c\u2026 hey\u201d\u201cRegret\u2026\u2026!\u201cOh well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be who you want to be\u2026!\u201cRight\u2026\u201dWe were never going to be who we really wanted to be.There\u2019s nothing we can do about it, because we\u2019ve become \u201cinhumane.\u201dThen there was no word between us. Instead, Ufi walks over to me and Al.\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201dI needed to say something, and I tried to open my mouth \u2013 my fist flew in. I felt my feet off the ground in the impact of a fist slipping into my cheek.As it was, I was rolled next to Al. Honestly, the moment I was beaten I didn\u2019t know what had happened, I could only blink my eyes black and white.\u201c\u2026 Hey, Uphilia, what?\u201d\u201c\u2026 this is! The minute this fight made me worry, the minute my engagement was broken on its own, Yikes!!\u201d\u201cGuhhhh!?\u201dThat, Al is getting beat up too!? His fist grabbed up his chest and pierced Al\u2019s cheek, and Al is rolled to the ground again. Standing up, Yufi is breathing on her shoulders and still looking down at us.\u201cThis is what I want to do!\u201cWhat do you want to do\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s both a fight and a defeat! If it\u2019s anything, fight with me too! Hit me if you want! If you don\u2019t, if you say you can\u2019t exchange words, do so! From now on, more than ever, because now I wish I had!Trembling in tears, Yufi told us so firmly. I was just distracted and pointed my gaze at Al.Al is more surprised than I am, he was just staring at Yufi. Then he narrows his eyes so that the gold tie is broken, and closes his eyes to divert his gaze from Uffi.\u201c\u2026 if you knew you were a lady who could make a fist out of a fight\u2026 you might have.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what about that, Al?\u201d\u2013 Oh, you\u2019re done.That\u2019s it, our fight is over. It was a fight that really didn\u2019t do any good. Mana Blade will be broken, and my body will be worn out with my wife\u2019s hands. My head hurts when I think about what\u2019s going to happen.But both fights succeed and lose? Oh, if it\u2019s been a success or failure\u2026 it\u2019s over now. I felt powerless to think so, and I exhaled deeply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: 29When the fight between me and Al ended and dawned overnight, we were all aligned and summoned to Father\u2019s office.I can only keep my head down there, starting with my father, my mother and the Duke of Magenta. Uphilia and Raini also seemed uncomfortable, and it was Ilia who was unfaithful even on this occasion, and Al, who was supposed to be a party to things.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Father holds on to his forehead like a headache, but he is drooling without words. I see all kinds of gritto there and it also looks like I\u2019m not sure if I should yell or moan. No, your feelings are very conjectural.The Duke of Magenta will look at us immovably, and my mother is just sitting quietly. Wow, I feel heavy. And my stomach is hurting. I want to truly go back to bed and sleep. I honestly have a pain in my body from last night\u2019s recoil, so I want you to give me a break.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 what do I ask the rest from?\u201cAs for that, if I say something too\u2026\u201dWhen I thought Father had finally spoken, I had trouble responding again.Last night, after we settled on a fight with Al Kun, it seems that me and Al Kun lost consciousness at about the same time. The noise of the exhibition also passed on to Father, and Ilia reports that she and I were dazzled and about to fall to grasp the condition of Al Kun.Fortunately, most of the nobles who attended the exhibition were not out of the venue, and since the quarrel between me and Al-kun ended while we were in turmoil, it seems that those who knew that we had fought were kept to a minimum. Still, the Knights and others have noticed that there was a battle beside the outhouse, and a decree has been laid.I\u2019ve asked Ilia since I woke up, so I don\u2019t have a clear idea of the details. Al-Kun was put out of the palace with me after he collapsed, so it\u2019s a similar situation to mine.\u201c\u2026 then report on Miss Raini and Algard\u2019s body first\u201d\u201cYes, first of all Raini, but consider it a completely vampired one. Unlike before, power came under control, flesh dying, and vampire survival instincts required human blood intake.\u201dRaini totally vampired. As I told my father, the good news is that the control of power can now be done by Leini\u2019s will. Instead, if I did not consume regular blood, I would fall into withdrawal symptoms. They also got blood from Ilia this morning.I have to make a follow-up on how much blood Raini has to consume from now on. This is not a problem because they can also optionally choose Raini to vampire subjects they were concerned about.Though I solved it when it came to unconscious honey traps, I guess it\u2019s good to say that an equally big problem has surfaced.\u201cAl Kun\u2026 I can\u2019t say as much as Raini, but he got the vampire trait. But the fact that the Demon Stone doesn\u2019t belong to him or that he robbed it from Raini doesn\u2019t seem as familiar or skillfully manipulative as Raini. You seem to have more of a demonic stone force in your survival instinct, or regeneration, than in your fascination aspects, if that\u2019s the effect of your quarrel with me. In the future, the progression of vampirization may strengthen your power, but when it comes to control, Ar-kun is better than Raini, so I was wondering if it would be an immediate problem\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be a problem in itself!\u2026\u2026 ha\u201dIt\u2019s the state I mentioned to my father about Al. Should I say half a vampire? Although it was close to Raini before, there was nothing like unconsciously attracting others like Raini. Although Al was laughing sarcastically when he found out about his condition.If vampirization was going on there without my intervention, the Demon Stone could have also given power to the fascination aspect.\u201cCan you take out the demon stone?\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s already completely taken in. Alkun\u2019s vampirization is inevitable.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026My father brought me to the chair to look up to heaven silently. I was about to be summoned again. No, yeah. I really don\u2019t know what to say!?\u201c\u2026 you inherit vampirization, don\u2019t you?\u201cNo certainty, but definitely first\u201dSo Algard\u2019s kid\u2019s gonna be a vampire again?\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s a good chance that it will\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dFather opens his eyes as he decides to be ready, and turns to Al.Al also quietly returns his gaze to his father. For the time being, the two people who were facing each other in silence end with their father breaking the silence.It\u2019s Algard.\u201cYes, Father\u201d\u201c\u2026 any explanation?\u201cNothing. My sister is still talking.\u201d\u201cAdmit that you tried to rule this country with the power of charm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I had, and I thought so.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you idiots\u201dThe squeezing father\u2019s voice had no power. Father quietly continues his words with his fingers as he stretches a wrinkle that leaned between his eyebrows.\u201c\u2026 there is nothing else that will make you obsolete. I can\u2019t let you and your son inherit the throne.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAl also nodded quietly to accept everything without showing any emotional swings in his father\u2019s proclamation.That\u2019s the only way. Al Kun\u2019s vampirization is inevitable. And if it\u2019s going to be hereditary, you can\u2019t let it inherit the country. That decision is legitimate, and I think this conclusion is a natural conclusion.\u201c\u2026 Anisphere. One, ask.\u201d\u201cWhy should I, Father?\u201d\u201cTo Algardo, is it worth using?I couldn\u2019t answer your father\u2019s question right away. \u2026 is worth using.\u201c\u2026 it is urgent for us to know the ecology of vampires. And whatever information we get, we need to prioritize.\u201d\u201cRight. Algard, then. \u2026 you will dedicate yourself to this country.\u201dAl-Kun laid his eyes down on his father\u2019s proclamation and pierced his immobility without saying anything.Father was staring at Al like that. For a moment my clenched fist, I saw it tremble.\u201c\u2026 there is no freedom in your future. Skip your neck if you imitate inadvertently. Use it to atone for its sins until it becomes flesh and dust. That is the warmth from the rest. Good for you, Algard!\u201cHa!\u201d Your Majesty, thank you so much for your warmth!His father was shuddering small at Al Kun, who bowed his head deeply and thanked him like a subordinate.Is there no freedom? It\u2019s a killer, isn\u2019t it? Yeah, I would, too. There\u2019s still something to look into in vampire ecology. Al Kun is valuable in the sense that he can compare to Raini\u2026 and Al Kun is already a sinner. Even human experiments that Raini can\u2019t do can be done if Father commands them.And that\u2019s what you have to decide as a king. I learned that a vampire existed. Then the threat must be accurately measured. People must know for that reason. Even if we dedicate Al Kun as its foundation.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Algard\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you resent the rest?\u201cNo.\u201dAl, with his head up, shakes his head quietly to the side. With a face like a possession fell, smile.\u201cWhat I resented was everything in the world. Born, to this day\u2026 all of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ha ha. Right\u2026. everything. Do you resent everything? It\u2019s a big one.\u201dFinally, Father distorts his expression and stains it with remorse. My mother also chewed off her lips, bleeding from the edge of her mouth. Still, I wipe away the tears with my hands.\u201cOur immorality is due to this deeply ingrained resentment. Who, not. Everything, for me\u2026 there was no salvation. That\u2019s what I admitted. That\u2019s everything to me. I resented you. I just resented him.\u201dQuiet everywhere to tell a grudge, but surely Al speaks in weighted terms. I can\u2019t measure that inside. The heat in the words hasn\u2019t gone away, but it doesn\u2019t get as violent as a flame. I still get the impression of smoking ash.But why not? There is no fire in the ashes. I was so sure. It seemed like a hole in my heart, even though I was sure I thought to myself.\u201cEverything in the past. Running waterfalls never rise. Now\u2026\u2026 I want to face this sin. We apologize for not meeting your expectations. Father, Mother.\u201dMy mother couldn\u2019t bear to be called my mother, so I let out my breath and tears so that I could only gasp once. The tears that broke down did not stop, and Father laid his eyes down carelessly.My mother, who was holding back next to my father, stands before Al. Tears don\u2019t stop anymore, and I still look up to Al with a motherly perseverance.\u201c\u2026 I regret it. I just regret it. Algard\u2026 Still, I meant to be your mother, even so\u201dAl-kun turns to her mother, who tells her in tears, to kneel down and look at her. The expression was too mild to my mother and was going to disappear now.\u201cYou are the great one. Please don\u2019t confuse me. You were the country\u2019s beloved mother. Please don\u2019t be proud of that. It is the only filial piety that can be conveyed from me, who was an unfortunate son.\u201d\u201cWhat is filial piety? I\u2019m a very unfaithful man, you are\u2026. oh, the color of my eyes is already like this\u2026 red\u2026\u201dWith his hands on Al Kun\u2019s cheek, he zeroes the exhalation of his mother trembling as he meets his forehead. All I can do is lay my eyes down, blocked by flowing tears, trying to stare at al-kun\u2019s face with unstoppable tears.Al won\u2019t let his mother do what she wants and move from him. Though I closed my eyes to hide my eyes if they mentioned the color of my eyes.\u201c\u2026 Your Highness. May I?\u201c\u2026 Yep, Duke of Magenta. I\u2019m sorry to disturb you.\u201dIf Lord Grants ever spoke through silence, Mother stopped crying like a lie and went back next to Father. Although her eyes are bright red, she has returned to her normal mother\u2019s appearance.Al also rises from the position he was on his knees and becomes upright immobile\u2026. I wonder what it is. True, it\u2019s clumsy, isn\u2019t it? My mother, my father, and Al. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m clever, but I wonder what it really is.\u201cPrince Algard. Can I ask you a question?\u201cThe Duke of Magenta\u2026. Yeah, whatever.\u201d\u201cHave you made your own plans from scratch from one case of this, no, Baroness Cyan?I could see Raini bouncing his shoulder off the mosquito net. Yes, Al said it was fascinating, but there was something strangely calm about it. I wonder what the hell you were thinking there and it was working.Once in Lord Grants\u2019 inquiry, Alkun breathes as if to prepare his breath, then tells him straight back in return for Lord Grants.\u201cNo. Not everything is my idea. The Maurits of the Chartreuse family are involved.\u201d\u201cHe did? Or are you even involved in a case of divestiture?Was it intentional, after all, to try to disturb me then? Or are you even involved in a case of divestiture? Wasn\u2019t that the enchanted surrounding B?\u201cMauritz had a deep knowledge of magic. Enchanted by Raini, Mauritz felt unusual about his condition and came to know his vampire. And you brought it to me. I was wondering if you wanted to secure the throne.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what? Guarantee the throne. I would have given up my right to inherit the throne if it had been before my engagement was broken, right?I raise my doubts unexpectedly. Because only Al Kun has the right to inherit the throne at that time, it was decided that Al Kun would be king for sure and nothing. Something\u2019s wrong with Mauritz.Al, who heard my questioning voice, distorts his expression into a grin just a little as troubled.\u201cNow that I think about it, it seems like a lot of it was blown in. Mauritz sees Uphilia in particular as a rival\u2026 I wonder if the King really thinks that Anisphere should take his son-in-law, too\u201d\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d say\u201dNo. Do you want to be able to turn that kid\u2019s head into barren land?\u201cSo we\u2019re the real allies,\u201d he said. To be honest, I was halfway there\u2026 but I learned about Raini\u2019s power and was attracted to him. Vampires are one of the ultimate in magic. Who should truly sit on the throne, etc. \u201c\u201c\u2026 Sure, the Count Chartreuse family was bound by their magical faith, but they wanted to raise their vampires to you\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we crush it?You can\u2019t keep your mouth shut on a boulder, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s such a fanaticism to say magical faith.Certainly vampires are the ultimate in magic and have many advantages if you meditate on the fact that you have to sip the blood of others. However, the disadvantages are as great as that. I don\u2019t know exactly how long a vampire can actually live, but it\u2019s also a headache to stay on the throne long enough.\u201cPerhaps he wanted to work in a magical exploration by repainting the country and becoming a vampire himself. If the country itself accepts vampires, the disadvantages of vampires can largely be eliminated\u201d\u201cNo guys!? That\u2019s totally no guys!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 the princess says that?\u201cIlia, I\u2019m not studying because I want to annoy others!I don\u2019t want you to come with me! Truth be told, my magic is academic, not religious!Lord Grants, who was listening, touched him to stroke his jaw before sharpening his intimidating eyes even clearer and zeroing his groan.\u201cLet\u2019s hit the hands. Just now, we have also heard that Master Anisphere worked a wolf when he was distracted. Including a blow to Prince Algard would be enough to cut your house off.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Regardless of the blow to Algard, isn\u2019t Anispheric distraction the usual thing?\u201cFather!? That\u2019s where you shouldn\u2019t go!?\u201dI\u2019m not distracted! Extremely sane!\u201cHas anyone else been involved besides the Count Chartreuse family?\u201cNo, only me and Mauritz are the very backbone of the plan. The other endorsers didn\u2019t know about the plan, and\u2026 after Raini got hold of it, they were going to remain corrupt as well.\u201d\u201cOh no, this brother is thinking so scary\u2026!Instead, Al\u2019s the one who\u2019s upset. I knew it! I\u2019m still decent!\u201cAnd Count Chartreuse in this matter?\u201cYou\u2019ve given me a lot of support back there\u2026. My mother said if I vampired her, she could use it for diplomacy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?Whoa, my father\u2019s clean. Uh, you make your mother a vampire. That\u2019s too dangerous in many ways. It\u2019s such a glimpse of the future. I\u2019m too golden for the power of charm and ghosts to my originally diplomatic mother.My mother, who was counted in the calculations of the conspiracy, is also grinning like a lion. Oh, this is the Count Chartreuse house, it\u2019s over. Terror, horror.\u201c\u2026 or you kept taking that poison a lot\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought it was. He just needs to kill his mind and keep weighing in on the balance of profits. And then it\u2019s not too late.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s just a little bit like Ufi to say that\u201d\u201cMaybe there were some similarities\u2026. I knew Uphilia would hold me dear. But maybe that\u2019s why I was unnecessarily neglected.\u201dAl Kun then turned to Ufi again. Yufi stays silent, but Al turns his gaze and turns back.\u201c\u2026 again, should I apologize\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll hit you again if I apologize\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cRight\u2026. I feel like I let some fish get away with it.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I left my hands that I became a big fish. \u2026 it is I who apologize for not comforting you. Dear Algard,\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s pour it into the water. As it is, please flow to the sea. The vessel named me was too small for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 hehe, that\u2019s why it\u2019s too deep to say sea. Dear Algard,\u201d\u201cMust be.\u201dWhat the hell is this, looking at me and exchanging words like that? What does that mean?Or you\u2019re close\u2026. I\u2019m sure that if the buttons didn\u2019t hang differently, there would have been a future for these two to lead the country.Then Al Kun turns back to Ilia. Ilia remains as faceless as usual.\u201cApologize again, Viscount Coral.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ilia, call me as you used to\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ironic.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMy sister is a happy man. As long as I\u2019m jealous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an unbearable word. \u2026 me too, unfortunately\u201dIlia has been face-to-face with Al for a long time. The interaction felt just a little cheerful.The next time al-kun turned his gaze was Raini. Raini turns to Al with a look that looks complicated.\u201c\u2026 Dear Algard\u201d\u201cRaini. Apologize from the bottom of my heart\u2026. and I appreciate it\u201d\u201c\u2026 why thank you?\u201cWhatever the outcome, I\u2026 took the liberty of being satisfied. I wouldn\u2019t have lived if I hadn\u2019t. He must have stayed dead. You\u2026 breathed into my life. Please don\u2019t forgive the man who avenged that good fortune.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, I will not tolerate it. It hurt.\u201d\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 that hurt\u201dSoftly, Raini took Al\u2019s hands. Pushing his forehead against that removed hand, Raini closes his eyes.\u201cThat hurt\u2026\u2026 all the time, all the time. That really hurt\u2026\u201dAl Kun shook his shoulder at Raini\u2019s words, which he was told to repeat.He gently shook Raini\u2019s hand back with the hand taken by Raini and pressed his forehead against his hand just like Raini did. In a gesture of prayer to each other, they silenced themselves, and when they left, they just smiled at each other and left.\u201c\u2026 sister\u201dAnd it\u2019s me. Al, who turned to me, was laughing.That smile reminded me. What was at the bottom of my memory comes to mind.I can\u2019t help but think that Al\u2019s voice color sounds like the voice of that day.\u201cDo you remember that?Staring at Al Kun\u2019s hand offering his hand. I lay my hands on that hand so that I could gently touch the broken object.\u201c\u2026 a handshake to make up,\u201dVision seeps through. I wanted to forget.This kid was my brother. He was my brother who took me out to play with him out of hand. Sometimes I fought and this is what I always did when I made him cry. I laughed when I took his hand and shook his hand and cried.Laugh, I was there. What do I look like now? I don\u2019t have a voice like my throat is cramped.\u201c\u2026 sorry,\u201dIf I could just live like the people who normally live in this world. If I could bend myself. Such \u201cno choice\u201d regrets are on my chest.I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll repeat the same choice back in time. Even if that thoroughly drives Al Kun. I can\u2019t give up magic. I can\u2019t put a lid on this longing.No matter how many times I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been reborn. As many times as this soul can\u2019t erase its longing for magic.\u201cSister.\u201dTears fall and Al Kun has a calm expression at the end of his clearer vision. Always with a glare, he looks abominable when you look at me. He\u2019s not there anymore.\u2013 Goodbye.Yeah. Goodbye, Al.Goodbye, my brother. Someone I couldn\u2019t take my hand from, someone I let go of.And at the end of the day I did not face Al Kun, and he left the royal castle.Think back to the upside of things. First, Al-Kun\u2019s formal abandonment was declared, and the Chartreuse family, who had taken a hand in this case, destroyed your home. Of course, the execution of Count Chartreuse, including his son Mauritz, and his relatives, was handed down by his father.Al-Kun was to be flown to a remote area. It\u2019s a land on the border where people can hardly lean either. There he crossed with those whose fathers believed, and with the researchers who believed as well.Al won\u2019t be able to come out of there anymore. So it provides information on the ecology of vampires, which will form the basis of the country. There\u2019s no freedom, you can\u2019t choose to die on your own, you\u2019re just going to be kept and killed.And the other party, Raini\u2026\u201c\u2026 Raini, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes! Sorry!With Ilia\u2019s guidance, he brews tea in the way Raini, wrapped in samurai clothes, was frightened.Since then, Raini has been offered to the royal castle as my exclusive maid. Although Baron Cyan, who found out about the upside of the matter and who his daughter was, looked terribly shocked, he said that he did not cut off the edge of his parents and children and wanted to continue to treat them as fathers.But he wants me to wait to talk to Raini\u2019s stepmother. Or Baron Cyan said he might not be able to talk like this.\u2018I think this was a good idea. I really feel like we can start trying to be family. \u201cThat was also accepted by Raini. Raini also feared that if her charm was broken, she might lose her mother-in-law, who had been nice to her.Then the dream stays the dream. I can\u2019t tell you about the vampires. He wants to put aside time to tell her.With that happening, Raini continued my protection, but became a dropping point to become a samurai apprentice as a superficial position. Isn\u2019t he full of himself, now he seems to be joyfully following around behind Ilia? Hopefully this will ease Illia\u2019s burden as well.\u2013 Yes, when it comes to Ilia\u2019s burden, Ilia offered to provide blood to Raini herself.There\u2019s no way you\u2019re gonna let me or Yuffi drink their blood. Then he thinks he\u2019s a good fit to have a low profile in this. Still, from Raini\u2019s point of view, he\u2019s up there. I was very nervous at first.My father and mother are busy with Lord Grants encouraging me in my affairs. This is because there has been an increase in processing at once due to the abolition of Al-Kun and the destruction of the Chartreuse family. For a while, my mother won\u2019t be diplomacy either, she\u2019ll be putting in her strength as an assistant in internal affairs.Though I hear you have more time with your father and more private time, it is your father and mother who are deeply hurt in this case. Slowly, though I cannot say, I only pray that we may comfort each other and rest in peace.And when I say\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 aren\u2019t you going to be able to move yet?\u201cHmm, it\u2019s a lot easier\u2026\u201dAs I lay down in bed I look back at Yufi sitting in a chair.The influence of the dragon\u2019s magic through his body is not immediately removed. When I saw it, I couldn\u2019t do it, but I went, but then I repeated my life on the bed. I wasn\u2019t just sleeping, I was focused on it because I needed to put my magic back through my body.lazy as this had a severe cold. Thoughts are dull, flimsy, and bodies are lazy and scattered. Fortunately, if you don\u2019t have a cough, you don\u2019t have a runny nose.\u201cHa-\u2026 much. I want to get back to my body.\u201d\u201cThen make yourself comfortable\u201dYufi has made my care worthwhile. Ilia also has Reini\u2019s guidance, and Yufi has generally taken care of me because of Yufi\u2019s offer.While I was sorry, I laughed bitterly that Yufi had nothing to do either. And if you haven\u2019t done something, you won\u2019t be able to calm down\u2026. I honestly know how you feel.\u201c\u2026 Al, I wonder if you\u2019ve got it already\u201d\u201cWhat do you think\u201dUffi\u2019s gaze at returning the gavel is distant\u2026. Yes, if you keep your mouth shut, you\u2019ll think about Al.Even though I would definitely do the same if I regretted it. Even though there is no specification that I felt guilty, my heart will stare when I feel guilty over and over again.\u201c\u2026 go to sleep, Master Anis. My heart and body are tired now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201dYufi\u2019s hands seem limp. With such hands on my forehead, I closed my eyes with great care. It is true that your body is tired, as soon as you close your eyes, you will be drowsy.\u2026 I heard a song. A babysitter. Yufi is singing me a babysitting song. Though I\u2019m not that old. Feel beautiful at the same time. That was comforting, and my consciousness fell asleep inviting.\u201cGood night, Master Anis. Now, slow down and have a good dream.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: 30Many people refer to Princess Anisphere Wynn Palettia as a royal disqualification.I don\u2019t have a magical talent for acting like I\u2019m not royal. And I\u2019m immersed in an incredible invention, and I\u2019m drawn to the outhouse.But still, many appreciate Anisphere Win Palettia. It is someone who acknowledges the new concept of magic or who defines her essence.It doesn\u2019t deserve it if you look at one side, but it does enough to make it up to you. Maybe that\u2019s why Anisphere is the pile that leaves is told as if it will be struck.Well, there\u2019s a lot of anisphere to talk about ratings so far from nobility.So how do the people living in this country see Anisphere?It is the Duke\u2019s Lady, Uphilia Magenta, who follows a strange fate.How the hell does Anisphere Win Palettia look from her?My name is Ufilia Magenta. Duke of Magenta family duke warrant pledging allegiance to the Kingdom of Palettia. Would that be the easiest way to describe my identity?I am now walking down the castle dressed in elegant clothes like the ones worn by the civilians, not in brilliant outfits like the dresses I usually wear. Next door is also the Princess of this country, Lady Annis, with us.Platinum hair, which often appears in the royal family, is wrapped in a hat and is not noticeable, and Master Anis goes on through the castle town in the footsteps he is accustomed to.\u201cThis way, Uffi\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Dear Anis\u2026 not Anis\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is forbidden to treat you because you are impatient.\u201dI look down as the fever on my cheeks is about to rise on Master Ennis, who laughs joyfully.Yes, we are coming down to Castle Town with patience today.The beginning of the matter was Algard\u2019s distraction the other day. My Arcane Shell restoration, which broke in the middle of it, is the hang-up. When it came to blacksmiths, I left my hand because I was asking a blacksmith in Castle Town.We\u2019ve been in a hurry and busy day ever since. Even so, it is Lord Anis who has been mainly busy. Anyway, Master Algard has been abandoned and sent to a remote area.Now Lady Anis is number one in the right to inherit the throne. Then there were successive interviews with those who asked Ennis how he was feeling and tried to explore the sincerity and circumstances of Algard\u2019s abolition, and he was unable to move.And today, in her spare time, Ennis finally invited me to come down to Castle Town to pick up Arcane Shell.I also thought of the escort, but Mr. Anis showed me that he didn\u2019t want to take the escort when he was impatient. I was taken to Castle Town while it was coming along on its own so I could do whatever I wanted.It\u2019s not that I never like your patience. However, now that I\u2019m close to the throne, I want you to be concerned about your danger\u2026\u201cDoes Uffi come to Castle Town often?\u201cNo, not really\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about inspections?\u201cIt\u2019s about your father\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t really like it because it atrophies civilians no matter what they are in the capacity of Duke\u2019s Warrant Lady. Still, if it is an inspection, we must see the lives of the people and feel many things. I miss thinking that a little bit.What about now? Now my position also feels like I\u2019m floating in the universe. I don\u2019t mean to be an assistant to Ennis in magic, but lately I think Ennis has stopped studying magic itself because he has also been involved in politics.I don\u2019t shake Master Anis to talk about politics to me\u2026. I think you\u2019re paying attention. I\u2019m the one who leans in on Master Anis as his assistant, but when he tells me to take my time, I have nothing to do.I used to try to deserve to be the next queen, but now I don\u2019t have that kind of pressure. I find it a little painful because I feel that it is protected by Master Anis\u2026\u2026\u201cRight here, Uffi.\u201dLooks like I got to my destination while I was distracted by my thoughts, and I raise the gaze I was lowering.Town workshop with no weird philosophy whatsoever. Size is arguably small within this castle town. From the size of the store, it looks like a workshop for individual customers rather than for mass production.You should be aware that this difference is handled differently depending on the owner, or the merchant who employs the owner. Sometimes it has a merchant as powerful as a large workshop, and he has a nose for business talk stories.On the other hand, small shops like the one where the workshop owners open the workshop alone have a lot of artisanal temperament and tend to feel strongly committed for that matter. Your father told me that even when it comes to workshops in bulk, the response changes in the products you deal with and the surrounding environment.Surely it would be natural to choose these small, skilled craftsmen\u2019s workshops if you were to work on inventions of magic.The name of the workshop on the sign out there seems to say \u201cGana Martial Arts Workshop\u201d. Master Anis opened the workshop door without a knock and went inside.\u201cTomas! I\u2019m coming in!\u201cAh, anise\u2026 anise!If I rushed after him and let him inside, the sight exactly like the painting greeted me.There stood a good, eye-catching youth there. Nothing less than my father\u2019s sharp red-brown eyes in a light brown hair with a slender hair. There is dirt and so on in the middle of the work, but I still wonder if the skinny yet successfully squeezed figure is no less than that of a knight.Speaking of shortcomings, there is no facial expression on that face\u2026\u201c\u2026 Master Anis? That was a long time ago.\u201d\u201cAre you ready for what you asked for?\u201cHmm. Take it\u201dI accidentally made my eyes peel. Though impatient, this artisan named Tomas should know that Lady Anis is a princess. Still, I observe and see if this attitude is of no interest to the secular.Then my gaze was pointed at me, too. After sending some surprise glance, Tomas turns to Master Anis.\u201cWho?\u201cMy assistant\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, that user\u201d\u201cI told you to bring him in, didn\u2019t I?\u201c\u2026 Hmm. This isn\u2019t a beautiful place for a lady to come.\u201dTomas groans so much that he seems to groan abominably. Speaking of which, it\u2019s like Anis used to say he hates nobles\u2026Should I say hello here in nature rather than in awe?\u201cMy name is Yufi. He said he could have any family name.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know. Rumor has it that Ennis split his fianc\u00e9e from Algard.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t catch you, did I? Well, there\u2019s a complicated reason, so you can just say what you want to say.\u201d\u201cLet the nobles fight. I don\u2019t want to get involved.\u201dWith a laid back look, says Tomas. Even though your face is neat, all the faces floating around are Buddha tops and rugged expressions. I get the impression that you are very difficult.\u201cIt\u2019s Tomas Ghana. \u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to be afraid. It\u2019s Yufi who\u2019s here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. That would help.\u201dI just softened my attitude a little when I told him I didn\u2019t need to respect him. You don\u2019t like to be awed, though you don\u2019t seem like a bad person.\u201cSo? What about Arcane Shell?\u201cI fixed it already.\u201d\u201cCan you show me?Encouraged by Master Anis, Tomas wipes his hands and cleanses them, then returns with an arcane shell in his hand that was placed to rest.Through the arcane shell that remained tucked away in the sheath, there was a figure there that was no different than it had been before it broken.\u201c\u2026 make sure\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dNot to Master Anis, but to me. The feel of the arcane shell in my hand is so natural that I don\u2019t think I was leaving my hand. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable standing up again and again. I accidentally exhaled because there didn\u2019t seem to be a problem seeing it through magic.I would appreciate it if you could fix it perfectly so far. Without this completely, I became restless. It\u2019s what Ilia used to say, that knowing the convenience of a magic prop doesn\u2019t get you back into your previous life.\u201cExcellent work. It\u2019s not uncomfortable.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 something?When I told him with the arcane shell in his sheath, Tomas was staring at me with serious eyes.When you look surprised at that gaze, you scratch your head back like Tomas panicked a little.\u201cNo\u2026. you\u2019re using it right now, so I know. I thought I could believe it because it was a recommendation from Master Anis, but until I actually saw it, I was half-hearted\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I see. \u2026 now I can\u2019t calm down without this anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201dTomas narrowed his eyes so that he could think of something. And what I thought, I\u2019m turning my gaze to Master Anis, who was appropriately looking around at what belonged to the workshop. What are you doing, Master Anis\u2026 you are too free\u2026\u201cDear Anis, I\u2019ll give you a penny so you can buy me something appropriately at the stall.\u201d\u201cOh, is that good?!?\u201d\u201cMa, wait!?\u201dI accidentally screwed up, but I\u2019m not wrong!? I\u2019m royal, I\u2019m royal even though I\u2019m here with patience!? Is there a good reason to treat me like such a child! And please don\u2019t make Master Anis happy! Despite your patience, the royal family! Don\u2019t be happy to get a penny!\u201cI want to talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026 hmm? What, I think it\u2019s hard to dictate to a boulder?\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re going? You\u2019re not going?\u201cI\u2019m worried about Tomas because he\u2019s a lousy mouth. Well, I\u2019d better go, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201cOh. Especially since Princess Anisphere won\u2019t let me hear it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok. Okay, I\u2019m coming. And Yufi\u2019s share is good, right?\u201cWhatever you want.\u201dThat being said, Tomas took out the money and gave it to Master Anis, who left flat.Though I tried to pull it off unexpectedly, I was concerned about Tomas\u2019 words earlier. If you accept what I don\u2019t want Anis to hear, you will understand.\u2026 what kind of distance are you two at? Master Anis seemed nervous, and Tomas is natural. That\u2019s all we seem to forgive each other and not be aware of the difference in identity\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. All of a sudden we\u2019re both gone.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026. who else is in this workshop?\u201cHey. I have a sense that I\u2019m bigoted. It suits you sexually to work alone and do your own satisfying work\u2026. I have a chair for visitors.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.That said, Tomas brought me a chair, so I decided to sweeten it. Tomas brings the chair the same way, and we turn face to face.\u201c\u2026 you think you\u2019re changing Master Anis?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 to the point where I doubt there\u2019s a common sense word anymore\u201d\u201cRight. But he thinks he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s already\u201dOtherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been here. What would have happened by now without Master Anis? You could have lost sight of your existential significance and broken your heart. On the contrary, it is possible that the country was turning into something else.The only reason I have it now is because of Master Anise\u2019s movement. I\u2019m about to bite my lips wondering what I could have done there. I know you\u2019re protected. But am I made of something just being protected\u2026?\u201c\u2026 Hey, Master Yufi. Can I ask you something clearly?\u201cWhat is it?\u201cIs the next king, Master Anis?Mr. Tomas, who mouths that question, is just serious, and I correct my attitude with nature, too.\u201c\u2026 it is now Lady Anis who has the primacy of succession to the throne. There\u2019s already been talk of Algard being scrapped, isn\u2019t there?\u201cAh. That\u2019s why I want to make sure. Is the next king like Anis?\u201cYes, I think it will be\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201dSeverely Tomas exhales. Obviously not happy, with the look.Doesn\u2019t Master Anis still think he deserves to be royal? That\u2019s why you want me to take my seat off?\u2026 If so, why to me?\u201cMaster Yufi, is that definitive?\u201c\u2026 so anxious?\u201c\u2026 maybe not as anxious as Master Yufi is worried about. A lot of people would love it if that man became king. He always thinks of us as civilians.\u201dTomas\u2019 expression turns around and turns into something gentle. It\u2019s also somewhere to be proud, to be proud of something.\u201cFew things have improved because of Lord Anis\u2019 opinion of the King. That guy put himself in our sights and moved what we needed and what we needed to do\u2026. he says it\u2019s natural. But you\u2019re not, are you? You\u2019ve never seen nobility live like this before, have you?\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right. But that\u2019s what I think it is. Nobility is nobility, civilians are civilians.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t deny that either. You and others are taking responsibility instead of wealth and status. It\u2019s a big responsibility to protect this country. That\u2019s what Lady Anis said\u2026. so I hate more aristocrats. Precisely someone who abuses civilians by wielding the privilege of\u201d nobility. \u201cTomas tells you if something has happened in the past, with a voice that even seeps hate. I can only narrow my eyes and drop my gaze on those words.As a matter of fact, I think there are a few people who forget their responsibilities as noblemen. Nobility is something that is responsible for its status. I also believe that it is not the nobility that should be, such as forgetting it and behaving tyrannically.But it\u2019s a difficult story if you ask me if it will be passed on to him, who is a civilian. So it is divided by the brackets of nobility and civilians. That\u2019s not supposed to be a word or a status to separate us from each other.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about living like us. I would be a little more convinced if I knew what kind of life the nobles were living too\u2026. It\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t it?\u201cIt\u2019s not easy\u2026 you can\u2019t say\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I am, too. So if we take responsibility for each other, that\u2019s fine\u2026. No, that\u2019s not what you want to talk about. Yes, Master Anis. That guy can be very trustworthy in that sense. There\u2019s gonna be a lot of people out there who think otherwise than me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but you don\u2019t find it pleasing\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you notice? Well, yeah.\u201dScratch your head like you\u2019re in trouble and Tomas clouds your expression.\u201cThat man will be able to do the king, but he won\u2019t be fit for the king\u201d\u201c\u2026 not suitable, is it? Sure, he\u2019s a ruinous one\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not suitable in the sense of a wreck or something, it\u2019s not\u2026 that guy, you\u2019re carrying too much\u201d\u201cToo much to bear, is it?I leaned my neck against Tomas\u2019 words. I do believe he is someone who has some good mouth but a sense of responsibility. I could feel responsible from my attitude towards Master Algardo, and it comes from my response to Raini.\u201cThough I think that\u2019s a good talent as a king, as one who stands above. If you carry too much, if we help you, the minister\u2026\u201d\u201cI can be king. I could be, but you\u2019d be better suited to him if you let him do something else.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThat is an undeniable fact. I believe that Master Anis has the qualities to be king. But I also know from the bottom of my heart that Anis does not want the throne. What that person really wants to dedicate his life to is the study of magic. I know that too.But it is Anis who inherits the royal lineage with the right to inherit the throne. Whether he wants it or not. That\u2019s what\u2026 it\u2019s called royalty.\u201cIt would be different to talk about having the qualities to be able to do it and that\u2019s why they do it\u201d\u201c\u2026 but I\u2019m responsible. To the nobles, to the royalty.\u201d\u201cBut you have no precedent for a queen\u2026. does that really have to be carried by Master Anis? It would be nice if we could continue our study of magic even as kings, but we wouldn\u2019t, would we? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I\u2019d come and get your sword sooner.\u201dIndeed, Master Anis here these days hasn\u2019t gotten his hands on the study of magic, driven by his daily businessmanship. Do you have time to do research in the future, given the mindset, the knowledge, and the fact that you will be pursued by government to become king?If Master Anis stops studying magic, can someone take over? \u2026 spreading existing magic props to the world may come true. But will a new idea emerge?If you think about it that way, Master Anis is the only one for magic. And now even as royalty. I can\u2019t think of a way to reconcile these two big things\u2026 If you try to exchange it, it will take a lot of work.\u201cWhen that man becomes king\u2026 he won\u2019t be free. That\u2019s going to kill that guy\u2019s charm. If I stipulated that I was king, that man wouldn\u2019t come here anymore. At least\u201d Dear Ennis. \u201c\u201c\u2026 you know Mr. Ennis very well\u201d\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t changed since you were little, and that guy\u2026. Oh, maybe that\u2019s why. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m anxious that Master Anis is going to change extra. Master Anis, who talks about magic, was always brilliant. There was a lot of empathy for us who couldn\u2019t use magic. We all expected Lady Anise. He\u2019s the one who listens to us and tells us his dreams.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t change being king.\u201d\u201cWho is he? But aren\u2019t you not allowed around?I won\u2019t allow it around me. You can\u2019t deny anything when you say that.If Master Anis becomes king, he will increase what he will not forgive around him. I will do so with me. The king shakes himself as king, and he must guide the people. Because it is my responsibility.That way, Master Anis loses his freedom, and if you say so, you can\u2019t deny it either. It is also easy to imagine Anis killing his heart for that reason and becoming king.Because he can do it. Your father has seemed to have restored Anis\u2019 right to inherit the throne in anticipation of it.From any point of view, we may not be able to avoid the flow of Lord Anis becoming king anymore. But\u2026\u201cBeing king, will that make Lord Anis happy?\u2026 The words asked by Tomas remind me of the words in the back of my brain.\u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get the happiness you wanted from the bottom of your heart, with all the alignment. We are. \u2018That was a zero word from Master Anis for Master Algard.That left me so badly stabbed in the chest.Become king, the word. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a curse to take happiness away from Master Anis.Again it was strong, deep, engraved on me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: 31\u201cDid Tomas say anything to you?I heard Master Anis ask me to peek into my face. I felt my consciousness flying back somewhere far away, and I let my shoulders jump.After that, Master Anis returned to the place where Tomas and I had become subtle air, leaving the Gana workshop behind. I had the experience of eating the unfamiliar foods that Master Anis had bought me with this unfamiliar clue again.He said this is the taste that civilians eat. It will be cluttered and flavorful compared to what you eat from time to time. Still a strangely appetizing flavor. If you ask me if I like it, it\u2019s different, because it\u2019s too different from anything I\u2019ve ever eaten. So when it comes to fresh fun, it\u2019s close to that.If I turned my gaze to the town, I heard lively people. It was also the first time I had walked through the landscape of my life and had been blinded. That\u2019s where my earlier Ennis inquiry flew in, so my shoulder jumped.\u201c\u2026 it was just a public story.\u201d\u201cHmm. Because I didn\u2019t feel like I was here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201dI thought I was talking to Tomas. He said it was a curse to be king of Anis.Because he\u2019s royal. It\u2019s very easy to say that. That\u2019s why there\u2019s nothing else that can replace the king on his shoulders. If Master Anis were to give up and welcome his son-in-law, I guess the story would be different again.\u2026 No, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s essentially the same. The curse placed on Anis means \u201crestraint to freedom.\u201d People are small and small and bound, but the restraint of royalty is too heavy for Anis\u2019 talents. Lead the country and protect the people. That responsibility is too\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 she was worried that Lady Anis couldn\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cHmm. And you\u2019re on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 forgive me\u201d\u201cMeh.\u201dI get a blurry look at Master Anis\u2019 face laughing with pleasure. I would have been really busy lately. We also have less time to proceed with the study of magic. We also continue to extend our time relative to the nobles.Is this grin a real grin? I was wondering if you had any major anxiety behind it or if you were feeling hard. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. As I was once unable to understand Master Algard\u2019s distress\u2026\u201cEuphie?\u201d\u201c\u2026 too, I\u2019m sorry\u201d\u201cStiff tone\u201d\u201cHo, grabbing my cheek is\u2026 mmm\u2026!I get my face pinched with both hands and rubbed loose. It\u2019s very embarrassing because we have people going out and going.Although I managed to escape, I got more tired. Being unfamiliar is really tiring\u2026\u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it with magic. Al\u2019s gone, so there\u2019s no specification.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dI accidentally stopped my leg. I wonder why they noticed me, and was I so in the face?Master Anis was the usual nature and smiled bitterly as if he was in trouble somewhere.\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t need it. Look, there\u2019s no choice, he said he\u2019s used to it for a long time. Complaining doesn\u2019t change anything. Besides, it\u2019s gonna be tough not deciding who the next king is, right? The country, the people.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that good? Really.\u201dI couldn\u2019t bear to say that question. I had predicted what to say, but I knew it would deepen the curse for Anis.My inquiry will not break Anise\u2019s expression. I just smile loosely and say it.\u201cIt\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s something someone has to do.\u201dYou can\u2019t say anything more to me when you say that at your usual rate. It was the first time they had thought that not spinning words was so improper and impudent.What should I say to Lady Annis in the first place, even though I didn\u2019t have that answer in me?\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care about that. I\u2019m gonna go around town.\u201d\u201cWhat, that!\u201cTime is limited. I have to do what I want right now!Master Anis pulls my hand and rushes out. It is best not to be left behind because you are too unfamiliar with the fact that you ran out of hand.This guy is always like this. It\u2019s a wreck, you do whatever you want, and you go over it. Hard or sad. And it solves it ahead of time.If they don\u2019t pull my hand, they\u2019re going to leave me. I could only hold that hand and follow Master Anis.Later on, after a courtesy trip to Castle Town with Lord Annis, I was interested in a tea party at the invitation of the Queen. I was wondering if Lady Annis would be called too, but apparently I was alone.Beside me is Raini, a samurai apprentice. Raini, who for the time being had a level of half a serving from Ilia, was able to do the minimum work, so there was more to do with me and Ennis. Looks like you were in charge of me today.\u201cCould it be a breath disaster? Ufilia.\u201d\u201cYes, I live my days well\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than anything.\u201dShe\u2019s a queen who snorts satisfactorily, but I think she looks tired somewhere. From one of Master Algard\u2019s cases, the Queen does not turn to diplomacy to assist His Majesty in his internal affairs.Now the nobles of the Kingdom of Palettia stand in colour. Algard, who was supposed to be the next king, was abolished, and because of the succession to the throne, Ennis had the first right to inherit the throne.Those who have ever treated Anis coldly have not been able to set their attitudes, and those who begin to sell the festivities, those who stand still, their movements vary. I also wonder if it is significant that Lord Anis has become seriously involved in government as a royal family.Still, Master Anis doesn\u2019t want to get married for the rest of his life. There are still few voices about what they intend to do with the inheritance. I guess the anxiety about what\u2019s going to happen is something that goes around everyone\u2019s chest.\u201cWhat about Anis?\u201c\u2026 What do you mean?I had difficulty answering a question thrown by the queen for a moment and asked her intentions.\u201cI wonder if Anise has ever changed.\u201d\u201cRight. Seems like the usual, but lately I think they\u2019ve been putting some energy into politics.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026. don\u2019t you feel dissatisfied about that?\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t say anything about that.\u201dAre you worried about Master Anis, or are you looking for coarse? Either way, there\u2019s very little you can answer for me. Even though I also think that Master Anis is dissatisfied, I cannot answer when asked how far it is dissatisfied.The queen exhaled deeply in my response. Don\u2019t hide your fatigue, you\u2019ll be worried about how you\u2019ve fainted.\u201c\u2026 in the end, no one knows. Raini, sit down too.\u201d\u201cWhat!? So, but I\u2026\u201d\u201cI called you on an excuse. Please take a seat. I want to talk to the people beside my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ha\u201dTake a seat in the seat where Raini had another available with the look of fear. Was it the Queen\u2019s hope that Raini was put on me?\u201cAnis has been working so hard these days. Like it\u2019s ever been a lie. But for the first time, I\u2019m confused, honestly.\u201d\u201cThe confusion is that I can nod if I think about it before\u2026\u201dI honestly understand how uncomfortable it feels to be serious because Anis was too destructive for better or worse.\u201cI tried not to think of that kid as just a daughter from the day he pushed his claims through. That\u2019s what I was thinking when that led to stretching that kid out. \u2026 but I don\u2019t know about her now that she\u2019s avenged me.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I think there\u2019s something about Anis who can understand.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case with you, is it intentional?\u201d\u201c\u2026 intentional, is it?\u201cSometimes she struggles with understanding herself, but it just seems like she understands it and does an impression manipulation.\u201dImpressive manipulation, Anis acting like he doesn\u2019t understand himself.To be honest about it, I have the feeling that it would be. Sometimes you say you stand around trying not to interrupt Lord Algard\u2019s path to the throne.\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. Master Anis is brilliant\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. then at least I\u2019m showing you the vegetables more than I am?\u201cWhat about that? It doesn\u2019t feel like Ennis is neglecting the Queen.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m not. That kid doesn\u2019t try to hide that kind of favor much. She just doesn\u2019t know herself.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis himself, is it?\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about this one, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s comfortable with it. Because she didn\u2019t publicly proclaim that she didn\u2019t want to take over the throne. So if you\u2019re watching that kid act too worthy right now, you won\u2019t know. What are you thinking? That\u2019s why I was so anxious to talk to you. I also asked Orphans to see\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, what?\u201c\u2026 keep calm,. I\u2019m not supposed to be involved.\u201dI didn\u2019t know His Majesty had told the Queen that. Honestly, I\u2019m a little surprised.But I don\u2019t think so\u2026. Honestly, Anis is in a \u201cthat\u201d state because he is horrible.\u201c\u2026 Has the Queen ever seen where Anis was seriously pissed off?\u201c\u2026 that kid?\u2026 No. Probably not. Do you have any Uphilia?\u201cJust once. It was when His Majesty and your father asked for the restoration of Anis\u2019 right to inherit the throne.\u201d\u201cHow can you be angry?\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s ice\u201d\u201cIce?\u201d\u201cMy emotions are falling out and I\u2019m just pale. Like my heart froze.\u201dMaster Anis appreciated that he could only be a tyrant laying down a dictatorship.If you are confused because you have a heart, you should freeze that heart. Freeze and sharpen your heart for what the country needs. I know it\u2019s Lady Anise who can do that.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve been saying lately that I have no choice. You must be dissatisfied. But that man will still be king. Let your heart freeze, for example. I can do it if I need it\u2026 No, I can do it\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 yes\u201dLong, heavy. The queen\u2019s exhaled breath falls uninterrupted.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t help but feel the pain that I failed to raise my child.\u201d\u201cMy queen\u2026\u201d\u201cAlgard became depressed and dangerous. Anisphere has acquired the brilliance to kill her heart\u2026. No, Anisphere\u2019s. That\u2019s not wrong as royalty. But I guess that destroys what you\u2019ve been cultivating as a child.\u201dAs long as he is king, no individual emotions are required. What the king demands is fairness. There are kings to guide the people. I know, but I also agree that that fact weighs too heavily on Master Anis.\u201c\u2026 now I wonder what to say to that girl. I could only deal with her as a queen. Laugh.\u201d\u201cNo, laughing, etc. And that is the Queen\u2019s assumption. Lady Anise doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026. looks like I\u2019m having a boulder too\u201dWeakened, he said. I shut my mouth to the queen smiling so tired.I said I couldn\u2019t do anything to this one either. That\u2019s what I thought, and I saw Raini sitting next to me taking a seat.\u201cRaini?\u201d\u201cMy queen, with all due respect, what are your plans for this aftermath?Yeah, I\u2019m going back to the executive branch.\u201cThen just take a little rest during this tea party time. Let\u2019s see what I can do.\u201d\u201cYours?\u201cLook into my eyes. We\u2019re still in the middle of a trial and error, but the effect is anise-sama\u2019s inkling.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Raini walks to the side of the queen and gives in to align her gaze with the queen.Its eyes are red indicating that it is a vampire. I also found some suspicious light in the back of those eyes. The magic flow also strokes your skin to let you know some signs.\u201c\u2026 look me in the eye and rest my heart. It\u2019s kind of like a hint, but it\u2019ll make you feel better. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t stay.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that being said\u201d\u201cMaster Anis is also getting a heartbeat. It\u2019s like dreaming of a little peace of mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 would be good. We need to be sure of your strength.\u201dHave you made up your mind, the queen stares straight into Raini\u2019s eyes. Raini made her face stretch like she was nervous for only a moment if she could turn her gaze from the queen, but she immediately smiled and turned her gaze back to the queen.\u201cQueen, is it Anis who makes your heart sick?\u201cRight. I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d\u201cIs that because that one doesn\u2019t show any sincerity\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t guess what she\u2019s thinking or what she\u2019s thinking.\u201d\u201cYes, then look me in the eye\u2026 it is the Queen\u2019s concern. That one loves the queen. You have to do it as a royal, the heart of it is certainly inherited by the queen. However, I do want to tighten my mind even more because it is different from before\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that right?\u201dThe queen\u2019s eyes are slowly lowering and becoming dull. Raini stops me so that I can put my index finger on my mouth where I float to see if this is okay.\u201cWhen the situation settles, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think about proposing a policy that encourages magic. That way again, it\u2019s the usual Anisphere. If you close your eyes, you can imagine.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah, right. That girl would say.\u201d\u201cHow far can I go, Anisphere, who will consult with you? It\u2019s a full smile that tells me there\u2019s no clapping.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026 it really seems to come to my attention\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, then, I think it\u2019s blurry, but don\u2019t question there\u2026\u2026 pull yourself out of it. How does the Queen answer to Lady Anis?\u201cWell\u2026 first of all\u2026 listen to me\u2026 give me\u2026 what are you thinking, Anis\u2026 you\u2026 I can\u2019t reach you\u2026\u201dTsk. A drop of tears spilled out of the queen\u2019s closed eyes. I kept myself in the chair, and, uh-oh, I put myself to sleep.Raini, who has seen it through, is exhaling heavily on her shoulders and weakened. I inadvertently ask Raini.\u201cRaini, what did you do?\u201c\u2026 I just blunted my heartache. I just encouraged them to dream because blunting them too hard would go too far into the implication. Later, if I wake up with dreams, I\u2019ll wake up with allusions, but I thought I\u2019d give you a little happy dream and rest your mind and body. It\u2019s tattooed with Anis and Ilaria.\u201dMental interference, a characteristic of being a vampire. He said he used it to relieve heartache. And I kept dreaming, he said. Was this the effective use of Raini\u2019s power that Master Anis was saying?And with the ink of Ennis and Ilia\u2026\u2026. hmm? I guess that means I tried it on both of us.\u201c\u2026 maybe even hint at Master Anis?\u201cYep. That guy said that because the dragon engraving works on its own, it would take me to follow the implication, too. Successfully implied.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. Dear Anis, no matter how much he is aware of it along the lines of implication, he breaks it quickly, so it won\u2019t leave any impact. The effect has been felt. The actual experiment was done by Ilya.\u201d\u201cBut you did it to Master Anis at first, didn\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 well, that\u2019s right\u201d\u201cWhat implication?That\u2019s how I get caught up in it. I keep asking Raini questions. Raini gives you a troubled look somewhere, and then you keep it to yourself like you\u2019re in trouble, right? And he prefaced and told me.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can reduce my interest in magic.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cNo, but I couldn\u2019t. And then I tried the royal consciousness and the allusions that encouraged it, but it all seemed to resist, and Anis had his head about how stubborn he was.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes. So you\u2019re still doing that now, Anis, of your own free will.\u201d\u201c\u2026 there are occasional days when you ask me to make an allusion, even just in my dreams. If you say yes, I think you do.\u201dThat helped me train myself to use my powers to make dreams come true, but Raini laughs like she\u2019s in trouble.Isn\u2019t that, conversely, like saying you can\u2019t do it without relying on implication? Nature and my hands were stretched if I thought so.\u201c\u2026 what am I doing when even Raini says I can help Master Anis\u201d\u201cYep\u2026? Hmmm\u2026 Sure is a bit overprotective for Master Anis and Master Uphilia\u201d\u201c\u2026 might Raini think so too?\u201cBecause that\u2019s true for me too. Otherwise, you can resist my mental interference, so let me use my powers to manipulate my mind? Dear Ennis, it\u2019s sweet in you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 right\u201dI know that Master Anis is sweet in you. That guy seldom puts people in his own pocket. Maybe that\u2019s why\u2026\u2026\u201cWe\u2019re especially avoiding Master Uphilia about political relations. I don\u2019t have the knowledge to just go into the subject, and I have a lot to remember as a samurai\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 can you say that to me?\u201c\u2018Cause I think I can stop Master Anis. About Master Uphilia, right?\u201cMe?\u201cPerhaps Master Anis is the one who forgives his heart the most. There is a verse in His Majesty and Queen that draws a line, even with affection\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s Ilia who\u2019s been dating a long time, isn\u2019t it?\u201cSometimes Ilaria says she can\u2019t stop you because she\u2019s been dating too long.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so why me?\u201cMm-hmm, subjective, but I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s reciprocal, right?\u201cEqual?\u201dMe and Lady Anise?\u201cI am out of the question in my position, and there is a place where Ilia is wrapped up in a subordinate relationship because of her long service, and I draw a line about whether it is because her Majesty and the Queen are family. Dear Anis, there aren\u2019t many people watching each other equally. I think the closest is Master Uphilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I have just been helped by Lady Anis. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s probably because Master Uphilia has been helping Master Anis all along, right?\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s only recently that I started dealing with Master Anis, isn\u2019t it?\u201cEr, whatever the reality, I think it\u2019s because of Uphilia that Ennis was able to do whatever he wanted without worrying about the royalty. Master Uphilia said she was not worried about anything because she thought she could support Master Algardo. So I\u2019m sure he feels that he wants to make it easier because he made me struggle because of him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 but I am\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what happened to the results. It hurts me so much. Lady Anis tells me there was nothing I could do about that. And no matter what happens to the results, what you try so hard to do doesn\u2019t disappear. I think that\u2019s why we have Anis now because Master Uphilia was a solid candidate for the next queen. You think it\u2019s your turn now, don\u2019t you?Because I\u2019ve always done what I wanted. Because I suffered because of that?Because you admit what I\u2019ve been doing, and now you\u2019re trying to fulfill it?So should I be free this time? But I don\u2019t know freedom.I don\u2019t know what to do. Dear Anis, I\u2026 can\u2019t be like you.Now, on what grounds can I say that I am equal to you? What should I tell you when I have just been sheltered by you?\u2026 to me, it remains unclear.As it were, the tea party was held because the queen took her time off.I woke up the queen at the end of time and asked Raini if she could ask me again when she broke up, and I was impressed that Raini was wolfing.I guess I have to look for it. What should I do now? Tell that guy he\u2019s equal, and there\u2019s just something I can convince him of.Just magical talent is not enough. Knowledge through education that we have developed is still not enough. Something tells me I\u2019m the reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32: 32\u201cYou\u2019ve got a pretty good look on your face, Yufi.\u201dConsciousness emerges that was blurred in the voices spoken. With all this happening these days, I look up to embarrassment. It was your father who spoke to me.Dinner seats at my parents\u2019 house now. He\u2019s a busy father, but he seems to try to show his face for dinner on the day I return to my parents\u2019 house, and this is how we have more opportunities to face each other.\u201cCaind was worried. I\u2019m still not being honest with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I let you get stubborn, so I can\u2019t help it\u201dNaturally, there was also a Caind, my brother, in the dining table with his family. But when will be the last time we have properly exchanged words? Caind will soon be out of the room, even at the dining table, as they will be avoided face-to-face in the house.When it\u2019s time to talk to Caind, things seem to change dramatically and go on losing sight of what I should be doing. I\u2019m just reflecting on whether that\u2019s why I showed a gap even in front of your father.\u201cUffi. Would you talk to me if I could?\u201cMother\u2026\u201d\u201cBut things have changed a lot lately. You are different from before. I just want to ask you something. What bothers you and what makes you anxious? Until now, you\u2019ve failed just to be tough on you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you failed, Mother. \u2026 but yes,\u201dI also feel ashamed of how much I had exposed myself to my thoughts if I had even heard from my mother about my worries. But it\u2019s a problem that I can\u2019t help myself with.And I wanted to ask Father again. Because it was no other father who advanced the restoration of Lord Annis\u2019 right to inherit the throne. What is your father thinking now?\u201c\u2026 father. What do you think about Lord Anis\u2019 reign in queen?To my inquiry, your father narrows those sharp eyes. It seems to me that some people are staring at me, but I\u2019m used to it, so I don\u2019t care.After a little silence, your father opened his mouth.\u201cNo matter how you say it. It is Princess Anisphere who now has the right to inherit the throne. Princess Anisphere will have to be queen and set the country up. On the contrary, what bothers you so much?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m worried that Master Anisphere should really be king like this\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether it should be. You must be king. Prince Algard has become obsolete, and the only direct bloodline is Princess Anisphere.\u201dWhat your father says is an unchangeable reality. Yes, in the end, we just have to break it off.\u2026\u2026 but I unwittingly grip my fist. I know. I know.It really brings a smile to Master Anis\u2019s face. And the way emotions fall out of that look and freeze.\u201c\u2026 if you become king, that man loses his freedom\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what a king is.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026. I know. Still, I don\u2019t want to tie Lady Anise\u2019s heart. If you become king, you will be told that you will inherit. Didn\u2019t your father think that all of them?\u201c\u2026 the only way to do this is to fulfill the wishes of Princess Anisphere whenever possible. In order for you to accept the inheritance.\u201dAgain. I kind of see how your father thinks that way. I didn\u2019t know that if Master Anis were to be king, he would want us to have children any day.\u201cSo what if Master Anis says he wants to focus on magic?\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to choose a king\u2019s mate. Or Yufi, there will be a hand in you taking on politics in one hand, but you will not be enough on your own. Which way, there should be more hands to use\u201dThis is also reality again. It\u2019s something you can\u2019t change. I know.\u201c\u2026 you look unconvinced\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not convinced. \u2026 he should not be king.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026?\u201cMaster Anis is a vessel of kings. If you brush your talent, it will glow. But it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not. Then Lady Anise\u2019s glow will fade.\u201d\u201cBeing a researcher in magic is what Princess Anisphere should look like?\u201cIncluding that. It\u2019s not like we should just let them do research. I am also well aware that I am not well informed. I just think. Being free is his irresistible charm.\u201dI want Lady Annis to remain free to choose. I want you to decide whether you want to be royal or immerse yourself in the study of magic.\u201cIsn\u2019t that compatible with being a king?\u201cI can\u2019t. The name\u201d shackles \u201dis\u201d king. \u201cOnce you become a symbol, you cannot escape. If we want freedom on top of that, that is what needs to change the shape of the country. And he pulls it off forever.\u201d\u2013 I don\u2019t care.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201cIf you want to lay a dictatorship, you can lay it, and if the degree has passed, we can advise you. That one is not stupid. It seems to me that if you advance, you will listen to me. That means giving it up to the king. The king\u2019s words are the future of the country, the way the country should be. If you have overlapping thoughts there, stand together, and if you are different, ask the right questions. That\u2019s my loyalty.\u201dIt is. I shut my mouth trying to keep the words going. Surely then will Master Anis\u2019s wishes come true? Then should I be like that, too? As your subordinate, stay on its side and don\u2019t break your heart\u2026?Is that the form of the future I want? I can\u2019t swallow it like a thorn stung my heart. If that\u2019s right, I think it\u2019s okay. Undrinkable emotions twist and stay in my mind.\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Because I never had such thoughts in me.\u201c\u2026 but that\u2019s my loyalty\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201cWhat do you think? Yufi.\u201dAsked the other way, what do I think? Your father said he was loyal. Reason tells me that if Anis is free to lay down a dictatorship, I should serve him for it.But every time I get caught in the heart, this is\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not rational.\u201cI do not want the crown of Tsu to be worn by Master Anis. I just don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s that guy who gets tied up. It is named King. That freedom is\u201d something that is allowed. \u201cI just want that guy to be free. Who it could be with, what it could be for.Oh, yeah. That\u2019s why it was easy. I just don\u2019t like being given a name that doesn\u2019t suit a king.You don\u2019t have to name Lady Ennis King or anything. You don\u2019t have to behave like a royalty by acting like a wreck. I just want it to be for someone, for a dream.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to tie it up. But it\u2019s not the same as letting you choose to be here or you choose to be. I don\u2019t want to tie you up, I want you here.\u201d\u2026 Ah. Finally, I get it.The failure I\u2019ve made to Master Algard must have been \u201cthis\u201d.I could only be a restraint. It was just a decoration. I had to have it before I could be asked to have the ability.Not to make you choose, but to make you choose. Not to bind, but to take your hand. To walk together, to defend that freedom of choice.\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that I have no choice but to be king. I want Anise to know that I can choose to be king. Right now, this situation is only a matter of pressing against Master Anis. That\u2019s not true. I want to give him the right to choose.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but no more Prince Algard\u201d\u201cStill, if you give it up, it\u2019s not\u201d my loyalty \u201c!Said it was my loyalty to protect that person\u2019s freedom. Give that man his heart, his world, his choice. Protecting the future I choose for myself is what I want.Now I finally felt that way with my chest up. As they say but not as they wish. To choose and challenge any difficulties there may be. It\u2019s not enough to just act the way you want, as you are given.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 right. Is that your loyalty? Ku, ku, ha, ha, ha!!\u201dI accidentally rounded my eyes. Your father laughed. And just say it\u2019s funny. Raise your voice. I\u2019ve been blinded by a trick that doesn\u2019t make me too much of a father.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. It was so funny.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand you\u2019re being childish\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not. No, maybe it is. Right, freedom. You\u2019re not like me, are you? Then it can\u2019t even work.\u201d\u201c? What\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was just a matter of course that you didn\u2019t do well with Prince Algard just because you did my imitation. I guess you had your core. I didn\u2019t realize that, and even if I put you in the shape of me, it would be\u201d as good as I can \u201c. \u2026 what you\u2019re trying to say is, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the same as it is in essence.\u201dTo one convincing and laughing father, without grasping the guidelines, I would tilt my neck. What the hell was your father\u2019s laugh bump\u2026?When I was perplexed, my mother, who had ever been static, raised her voice.\u201cYufi, you must be different from our generation.\u201d\u201c? Is that\u2026 what?\u201cYou know that when His Majesty Orphans took office, the Kingdom of Palletia was in a messy world, right?\u201c\u2026 Yes. I didn\u2019t know there was a lot of turmoil until His Majesty came to power.\u201dThat\u2019s what you learn in history class. It is now stabilized by His Majesty\u2019s hand in internal affairs and the Queen\u2019s diplomacy, but he said it was a series of hardships and misery until he was on track.He said there were times when he was about to go to war with another country. Such signs are now faint, and that must also be a gift from the Queen\u2019s diplomacy. And I know that the country has stabilized because His Majesty served it.\u201cWe had to tie together. In a disturbed world, there was no room for unified ideas, stability for the people, preparedness for external illnesses\u2026 and that\u2019s what I couldn\u2019t afford to choose.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, maybe you\u2019re the generation that\u2019s ready to choose.\u201dWith her hands on her cheeks, her mother smiles. That\u2019s not always the kind of grin you see, but somewhere with a soothing, joy-seeping grin.\u201cFor example, if it was a time of war, we would have strongly preferred Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic to a knight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that all there is to it? Dear Annis, I have heard of your work. But I didn\u2019t have to. Yeah, that\u2019s what we protected. It must have become abundant for you, the children, to be able to choose that way. Choice means that it\u2019s an idea that doesn\u2019t come out unless it\u2019s rich.\u201d\u2026 Sure, if you ask me, I did. To say you can choose is because you have room to choose.I say to your fathers that they didn\u2019t have such an idea, because times are probably different. And this world is what your fathers connected us to.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWe had to protect ourselves. Next, to connect to the next. But I guess you don\u2019t have to\u201c inherit the same \u201cto connect the next\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t forget my respect for my ancestors\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. Still, it is not something that must be protected and inherited. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, Uffi. Well, maybe Princess Anisphere is what we wanted.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis?\u201cRich the country, everyone can live with laughter. We\u2019ve come to do our duty to hope for such a country. Would Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic props bring us closer to that dream ideal?Maybe that\u2019s what your mother said. Lady Anis\u2019 magic props have many things to help her with her life. Both flying magic props and magic props to help you live.That is not a privilege granted only to the nobility. Lady Anis said it could be used by anyone, even civilians who can\u2019t use magic.\u201cUfi.\u201d\u201c\u2026 father\u201d\u201cI still want Princess Anisphere to be king. She has enough\u201c value \u201dto hold you accountable for it. of the country we protected, as the next symbol. He wants it to be the foundation of the country with magic and to build a new era. Now I\u2019ve strengthened that thought.\u201dYour father tells one of the words with a definite force. I can feel the strength of your father\u2019s faith in just one word.\u201cBut I don\u2019t live in your time to build. Of course, as long as I have this life, I will devote myself to this country\u2026 but your generation is the one who walks with the most anise, Yufi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd you want Princess Anisphere not to be king, but to be free. Then another king must be set up. But Master Algard, who was that candidate, is no longer here. Still want it?\u201c\u2026 Yes. If you give it up, I feel like I can\u2019t be me anymore.\u201dWhat do your fathers want and wish for us? Even if we can pass on what kind of ordeal we\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t feel the same way and hold our thoughts.That\u2019s why I want to believe in my beliefs. I inherited it from your fathers, the right I felt. Not just foolishly believing, but overlapping, thinking, and accepting.There is no more cloudiness in that thought. Still, whatever prayer there was. Again, I do not want Master Anis to be king.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cI have no means. But that\u2019s a dream story. That may be the idea that contradicts Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what does that mean?\u201cPrincess Anisphere has the talent she decidedly lacks as king\u201d\u201c\u2026 magic?\u201cYes.\u201dYour father nods loudly. Indeed, the Kingdom of Palletia has walked with the Spirit and continues to develop as a country of excellence in magic. The idea is still handed down as a faith.Magic is a privilege allowed to the aristocracy, something that our country should be proud of. That is also why I was wanted by the next queen. In that perspective, Master Anis is not talking about falling apart.In other words, in terms of magic alone, you can also view that Master Anis cannot be a symbol or a king.\u201cMaster Anisphere\u2019s legitimacy is a feat of blood muscle and magic. Well, there\u2019s been some behavior so far. He said to himself that there was some support gathered, but the wind direction from the nobility running the country would not be good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no matter how much faith is gathered from the people, it is nobility who moves the country\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Without the people, nobility can be formed, but it is not civilians who move the country\u2026. that\u2019s what Princess Anisphere\u2019s reign is all about. If it\u2019s goodwill, it can\u2019t be done right now.\u201dIt is true that such a future could also be possible if magic developed and spread throughout the country.Sometimes magic can be used as a nobleman, but it\u2019s a small part of it. That\u2019s what makes a handful of people like Baron Cyan, Raini\u2019s father.\u201cReturn to the story. In other words, it is fatal that Princess Anisphere lacks the talent of decisively magic in order to be king. Whether we bury this with magical merit or not, it will not be tolerably acceptable in the nobility of our country, which is rooted as a faith. I\u2019m proud to have defended my country by its magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that, I know\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to poke you there.\u201d\u201cPoke there, what?\u201cWe have no choice but to build a new king\u2019s bloodline. You remember how interested this country is? Yufi.\u201dTo your father\u2019s words, I accidentally stood up and laid my hands on the table.\u201c\u2026 a new king, the beginning of this country, you mean the\u201d Spirit covenant \u201d!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The beginning of the first king to entertain the kingdom of Palletia, and with that merit, to make the Spirit Contractor the blood of a new king.\u201d\u201cWell, I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable!?\u201d\u201cNaturally. Still, it\u2019s not like we can cross the tradition of lineage.\u201d\u201cIf so\u2026\u201d\u201cThen it would be nice to have\u201c royal blood \u201d. Even remotely.\u201dRemote, but?To that word I breathe in the facts that have surfaced, and your father turns his gaze straight to me.\u201cUffi, will\u201c you \u201dbe king?\u201cWow, but\u2026 but?\u201cEven though my Magenta family is now remote, there is royal blood flowing. I mean, it\u2019s thin for proof of lineage, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not justified at all. And you are also recognized as the next queen. [M] You will raise your name there as king with the qualification based on the first generation of the Spirit Covenant. If so, isn\u2019t it enough as Princess Anisphere\u2019s opposing horse?\u2026 the words your father tells you do not swallow well and sit down powerlessly in the chair as they are.\u201cIf you want it\u2026 you can turn down my blood.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you want the throne, abandon the House of the Duke of Magenta. And be adopted by His Majesty. Otherwise, my Magenta family will be the spark of contention for seeking to seize the throne. Whatever path you have, Princess Anisphere, it will be a spark\u2026 but remember, you have such a future.\u201dDrop the house.What your father says\u2026 I understand.But that\u2019s too much of a dream story, and I don\u2019t really feel it.I just couldn\u2019t say anything, and I just couldn\u2019t help but keep sitting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: 33I was looking at the sky blurry in my own room. I really don\u2019t even feel like sleeping from the back of my brain with the words your father told me repeatedly.I think back on my life so far\u2026. Think about it, how much did you pick out for yourself in your life?The status of fianc\u00e9e of Master Algard, as well as the praise of an excellent Duke\u2019s Lady. You must have been talented indeed. I\u2019ve also made an effort just to be worthy of admiration. Was my will there\u2026? Honestly, you can\u2019t put your chest up.I guess I did because they wanted me to, if they told me. I can\u2019t deny it. That was just it. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, so maybe I couldn\u2019t do anything.It was easy to follow. To be shown the way is just to move towards the goal. I could do that. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve lived a life that just glimpses the path and goals I\u2019ve been given. No worries, no confusion, no doubts.\u201c\u2026 what I want to choose\u201dThat\u2019s what comes to mind in this chest. Close your eyes and you\u2019ll see Master Anis\u2019 face. The fact that you smiled at me, the face that laughed naturally, the face that plotted something. I can remember the expression that froze my emotions and the crying face that was going to disappear.That\u2019s all I\u2019ve seen of that guy. I\u2019ve come to see that guy who gave me just one hand in a place where only one was cornered. I can\u2019t name the emotions that were born in this chest yet. I just can\u2019t ignore this thought anymore.\u201c\u2026 I am\u201dLook up at the moon. Today is a strong golden moon, and that reminds me of Anis\u2019 hair color.Reaching out won\u2019t reach the moon. Why do you still want to reach out? Hands on the moon, gripping to grasp the moon.\u201c\u2026 to be king, want to be\u201dFor that guy who\u2019s nobody, and for himself. To be myself.What I\u2019ve piled up so far overlaps with the ideals I wish for right now. This is for your country. And I hope my will is for that man.I want it. I thought so. First time from the bottom of my heart. I want that seat. I have a position where I can protect someone. We don\u2019t stop looking so much for the throne, which is the pinnacle of this country.Like making noises in me so that the gear meshes and something fits in. To such a sense of reality I closed my eyes and gently pressed my hand against my chest. As I pray for the future to come.Please, this choice. That this path I choose is not the path to fulfilling my wishes.It would be a little noisy if you went back to the outhouse. But that seems like the usual noise. Master Anis jokes, Ilia goes in to stop him. I guess the noise is increasing these days because Raini is starting to join us.To the extent that makes me feel comfortable somehow, I guess I\u2019ve been poisoned, too. The noise you hear calms your mind. With a slight smile I head to the room where everyone is.\u201cGibb gibb\u2026\u2026! My arm, my arm breaks\u2026\u2026!\u201cYes, Master Ilia, not too much for a boulder\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, to this extent\u201d\u201cNot good! The princess\u2019s luxurious arms will look adorable!?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 luxury, is it\u201d\u201cHow can you help!? Okay, sorry, sorry! Reflect!! Please forgive me!!\u201dUsual hustle and noise. I knock on the door even though I almost laugh at it. It was Raini who opened the door for me. Raini greeted me with a slightly troubled face.\u201cGood day, Master Uphilia\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re back, Raini\u2026. Again?\u201cYes, again\u201dI also smile back at Raini, who smiles bitterly. And, oh? I was made a Raini face that Was I looking so weird?But there are things that need to be prioritized over that now. I will walk over to Master Anis, who is still twisted in the arm by Ilia.\u201cDear Anis,\u201d\u201cI was just there!? Oh, welcome home Ufi\u2026\u2026! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Because I\u2019m not kidding!\u201cThat\u2019s an odd encounter. I\u2019m not joking either.\u201d\u201cIlia, get him there. I need to talk to you.\u201dWe go into arbitration, remembering the smile on the two\u2019s usual interactions. Ilia looks surprised, but she let Lady Anis go because I said so. Master Anis is stroking his arms with tears.\u201cThere he is\u2026 you\u2019re just kidding\u2026\u201d\u201cSomething?\u201cNo, nothing! So, Uffi? What\u2019s the story?Lady Anis smiles like she\u2019s been re-minded. I feel my mouth loose naturally on the smile I\u2019ve seen many times.I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t regret making this choice. Such certainty came to my mind naturally.Because Yufi wanted to talk, it was going to be a long story, so I asked Ilia to prepare some tea. I haven\u2019t had this time in a long time and my mind is relieved because I\u2019ve been in a rush of days lately because it\u2019s just a business meeting.And you\u2019re talking about it, right? Lately, Yufi has often looked like she thought. I wonder how shocked I was about Al. After that, you feel responsible for me having to take over the throne?Well, there\u2019s nothing wrong with Yufi about that. I can\u2019t say that Yufi wasn\u2019t at fault, but it\u2019s only natural that the nature of Raini\u2019s unconscious vampire and the stubbornness between me and Al can\u2019t be solved by herself.But I was wondering how I could encourage them to do good things, too, but when I got home, I wondered if I felt any different. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the story?\u201cYes, I would like to discuss the future with Mr. Anise.\u201d\u201cThe future, huh?\u201dI don\u2019t know about the future. Honestly, I think Yufi is floating in the universe right now. No, you mean I did that intentionally. Right now, I don\u2019t have time to get my hands on the study of magic. Then Yufi, who keeps him as an assistant, will have nothing to do.It\u2019s just that Yufi had a lot going on. I admit I didn\u2019t dare wave my job because I thought I was accumulating hard work. But if you want to actively consult with Yufi, I think you have to think about her future.Originally, if I were to be king, Yufi would be prime minister. Honestly, it\u2019s a strange story that there\u2019s no Uffi beside me for getting into politics. If Yufi wants to, will he be involved in government affairs with us in the future? That\u2019s comforting, though.\u201cI found what I wanted to do.\u201dThings I want to do. Yufi\u2019s eyes said so firmly forward. He\u2019s a strong eye with a will he didn\u2019t see these days.When would have been the first time I saw this eye of Yufi. I guess it was when I heard you were Al\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and said hello. I guess I was relieved in these eyes that you knew about me but you didn\u2019t scare me.Although it often clouded or lay low from Al-Kun\u2019s fianc\u00e9e-breaking disturbances, there was no shade in Yufi\u2019s eyes as to whether there had been any change in his mood.\u201cIf Uffi finds out what he wants to do, it\u2019s more than that. Now, I couldn\u2019t go on studying magic either. You don\u2019t mind if I focus on you?\u201cNo, your cooperation will be essential to what I want to do. So I wanted to talk to you in advance.\u201d\u201cMy cooperation?Well, what is it? I don\u2019t know what to do with Yuffi, even though she says she\u2019s willing to cooperate with me.\u201cYes, I must ask Anise herself to help me, and I would like to ask Her Majesty and the Queen to help me in my conversation.\u201d\u201cIs that what I have to talk to you and your mother about?That, again. You\u2019re about to do something very big, aren\u2019t you, Yufi? What, some kind of new state business or something? Sure, if you\u2019re Yufi, you can have one or two of the bills. It is.But I still don\u2019t see why I\u2019m pinched there. Because you\u2019re the next king? Well, if you\u2019re going to do some state business, you should talk to me first\u2026\u201cCan you help me?\u201cI wonder if it depends on the content. What are you going to do?\u201cOf the Spirit covenant, its clarification.\u201d\u201c\u2026 spiritual covenant?\u201cYes, I would like you to help me become a contractor myself.\u201dSpirit Contract! I can\u2019t believe Uffi wants to be a contractor. It\u2019s a little surprising, but given Yuffi\u2019s magical talent, he might be able to reach it. And if you become a spiritual contractor, you can gain enough standing to be protected and welcomed by the state.\u201cWhy are you suddenly again?\u201cI want merit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 feat?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFor what?Why would Yuffi want merit? I\u2019m losing my mind. I wonder what Uffi\u2019s thinking?\u201cBefore you answer, please allow me to ask you disrespectfully. Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is it?I dare you to call the princess and me with some intent. I correct my posture.Uffi turns off his grin and looks straight at me. Feeling nature and heightened tension, Raini, who had refrained, is behaving suspiciously.\u201cDo you think you will be king and that your reign will work?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I think I put a sinister face to Yufi\u2019s question\u2026. the answer to that question is settled.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it at first, and if I can unite, there\u2019s only dictatorship. It takes time to make this country accept the new concept of me. And after taking the time, the country only distorts for what it took. Of course, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want a stable reign because I think dictatorship will distort the country.\u201dI can\u2019t use magic. There is an absolute lack of talent required as royalty in this country.Even politics is not confident. I\u2019m not here with a decent education in the first place, and my connection to nobility is weak. Honestly, I\u2019d hold my head by now if I didn\u2019t have a hand tag named Yufi.My strength, magic, is also confident that it can be infiltrated if spread. But that leads to the destruction of the order that is now in place. It\u2019s convenient, so you can\u2019t spread the word. Because that\u2019s the only strength I have, I think I have to be prepared to push for distortion no matter what.I think that\u2019s my limit as king. I cannot rule my country until I destroy the current order. It would be the people of this country and future generations of historical researchers who would judge whether that was good or bad.\u201cStill have to do it. Without a leader named King, the country would be lost.\u201d\u201cEspecially you.\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, it could be hard on Uffi there\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to have a hard time with Anis, too, so I\u2019m going to have to be your son.\u201d\u201cThanks\u2026. So, does that question have anything to do with wanting merit?Return to the story. After all, what does Uffi want to find merit in order to unravel his spiritual contract?\u201cYes\u2026. Dear Anis\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI want that crown to be mine\u2026. Speaking of which, will you be surprised?You want the crown to belong to me? Um, I mean, what? Does that mean you want a crown?I mean, that\u2019s what you want the crown for?\u2026 Huh? No, no, I mean that\u2026\u2026\u2026. Yes?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cI want to be king.\u201d\u201cHaaaa!?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, eh!?\u201dMe and Raini\u2019s surprising voices overlap and even Ilia cracks open her mouth and disorients.Yufi is laughing like a child who has succeeded in amazing our reaction.\u201cOh, to be king\u2026 Uffi has no right to inherit the throne!? Huh!? Declaration of usurpation!? He wants to make a spiritual covenant, he wants to drain the royal family!?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I want legitimacy.\u201d\u201cLegitimacy\u2026 you mean the feat you want to earn by making spiritual covenants?\u2026\u2026 ah!?\u201d\u201cYes. The spiritual covenant is a feat accomplished by the first king of the Kingdom of Palletia. This is why I have the right to inherit the throne by embodying it.\u201d\u201cWait, wait!\u2026 No, wait! That\u2019s not enough, not enough at all! Even Yufi isn\u2019t an idiot who doesn\u2019t know that!?\u201d\u201cYes. I am not a royal person. But the blood of the royal family runs remotely in my Duke of Magenta house. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any justification for lineage at all.\u201d\u201cNo, I do\u2026!\u201cI want His Majesty to adopt me with that feat. And I want to give you the right to inherit the throne\u2026. this is all we can do, can we line up?\u201cAdoption\u2026\u201dI can\u2019t keep up with my brain\u2019s understanding of sudden declarations. So you\u2019re saying that Uffi wants to join the royal family by gaining legitimacy that I don\u2019t have? So you get the right to inherit the throne, aim for the throne?I can\u2019t understand it by saying it myself so far. It\u2019s certainly more than possible, if not impossible. Whatever it is, I am now alone without Al Kun, who was an opposing horse. But I have no magical talent, so I don\u2019t have a good reputation from the nobles.What if Uffi got a legitimate right to inherit the throne there and went up on the surface stage?\u2026 It\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t. Uffi was originally educated to come to the royal family as his daughter-in-law. If you use your abilities, it\u2019s certainly not an unlikely story. No, I don\u2019t!\u201c\u2026 who blew in? Talk like that.\u201d\u201cDear Anis,\u201d\u201cI did say I didn\u2019t want to be king! But that\u2019s not why I want to crack the country! Uffi is certainly close to getting legitimacy now. But that\u2019s not perfect either! It\u2019s not like when I was with Al!Even if you fight for the throne, the terms are different between me, Al, and me and Ufi.Because I had unilaterally given way to Al-Kun, there was no faction I could have, and Al-Kun prevailed. And I thought that was desirable. Because Al also had legitimacy.But it\u2019s not the same story when the other person is Ufi. Uffi stands for the capture of the throne. No matter how many adopted, she was originally the daughter of the Duke of Magenta family. That pulls my leg. So take charge of me or take charge of Uffi. Which is better, the terms of which are five fifths in my view.\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy story! The whole story went so well that you won the right to inherit the throne, you\u2019ll never come above me! And what would the Duke of Magenta do to come to the throne with his adopted son?\u201dMy father told me to cut off my blood.\u201cWhat do you think Lord Grants is thinking too!? Lord Grants blew in!? Let me restore my right to inherit the throne!?\u201dWhat the hell, that guy! No, I don\u2019t even know! No, I still don\u2019t know! What are you thinking!? No, I can\u2019t keep up with my understanding at all\u2026\u2026!Isn\u2019t that a embarrassment to stop thinking like that to push me!?\u201cMy father is pushing Master Anis. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get support if I\u2019m adopted and I get the right to inherit the throne.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026 no, no!? Why did we talk about that?!?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to make Lord Anis king.\u201dYuffi looks me straight in the eye and tells me. The strength of that will never wavers\u2026. I mean it. This kid really doesn\u2019t want me to be king.\u201c\u2026 why? I know I don\u2019t deserve it. I said cry. But then I don\u2019t know why Yuffi would want to be king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 not because of you. This is my fault.\u201d\u201cMy best,\u201d he said?\u201cI will not let you be king. You don\u2019t have to sit on the throne until you freeze your heart. I just have to let that happen. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\u201cHuh, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be king with your personal feelings!\u201cWho lamented that he didn\u2019t want to be king because of his personal feelings?Ugh\u2026! Hey, it hurts\u2026!\u201cSo, but I can\u2019t believe I want to be king for that reason! You can\u2019t admit it!?\u201d\u201cThen I can\u2019t admit I don\u2019t want to be king for that reason, either, like Master Anis.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the same!?\u201d\u201cI mean, it weighs the same. Besides, if you\u2019re going to take over the reign from His Majesty Orphanth, I\u2019m more confident that you can calm me down. I\u2019ll show you the legitimacy of blood, too. I will prove to you that the royal blood that flows through you will never fade.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 Ufi!\u201c- If I were to be king! Your dreams come true!Uffi roughed up his voice for the first time.It was just a cry of temper, but the core of my body seemed to shake for the first drink I heard.\u201cI am good at fulfilling all the roles I have been given. Whether that\u2019s the queen or the queen, the weight doesn\u2019t change. Instead, without denying myself that I lived that way, I want to be king myself. If you have a dream ahead of you.\u201d\u201cMy dream.\u201d\u201cThe happiness of approaching the magical mystery and continuing to chase the magical props for the people. You can ask for it. No, I forgive you. If I were king, you would be a people too. And it will be a family. Then I want to forgive you. I dreamed it would enrich this country.\u201dUffi takes a seat and reaches out to me. I can only stare at that hand.\u201cI pledge to your side to help that reign, even if it does not come true. And if it comes true, protect your dreams and let them be seen together. It is my wish and desire that you be free. We should be able to hold hands together, not fight each other. So, Master Anis. Please take my hand. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201dEven if Uffi can\u2019t be king, he becomes a belly that helps politics.If Uffi could be king. I\u2019m\u2026 free, okay\u2026?Staring at Yuffi\u2019s hand as it was offered, I put that hand.\u201c-\u2026 huh?\u201dI wonder who leaked the voice. I don\u2019t know.All I found out was the feel of my own hand playing Uffi\u2019s hand.My breath hurts. I can\u2019t breathe and my vision seeps. No, you can\u2019t cry here.I didn\u2019t know why I was crying, but I stood in the chair thinking I shouldn\u2019t show tears.The body moves without consciousness. Just my body trying to get away from here.\u201cAh, Dear Anis!!\u201dI wonder whose voice it was that called me from behind. I don\u2019t know. Nothing, I don\u2019t know.All I knew was that I ran away. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: 34\u201c\u2026 remember when you first met me?\u201c\u2026 come dress more sneaky\u201d\u201cI want you to hear my heart scream when you jump in my current outfit\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201cYou think apologizing won\u2019t make a bad rumor!?\u201dI escaped from the outhouse and jumped into the Gana Workshop as I dressed. I was out of the palace, so my outfit remained quite royal. Naturally, Tomas, jumped in, is angry and angry. I\u2019m sorry.Honestly, I care about Tomas. I can\u2019t afford it. The back of the nose is hot, and the back of the eye remains twitchy hot. If I got caught off guard, I was about to have a voice that didn\u2019t make sense, and I was like a child.Tomas sighed as he sat round his knee in the corner of the workshop to indulge in the uncontrollable things he couldn\u2019t even control himself.\u201c\u2026 go home\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a comforting place!?\u201d\u201cShut up, shut up. Don\u2019t get me into trouble. Eighty-nine, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\u201cNot nice! Me, princess! Yes, work!\u201cYou can go and report that the princess is knee-wrapped in such a filthy place, right?\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I said all I could!I really want you to give me a break about being brought back now. I mean, you\u2019re making a scene, aren\u2019t you? He noticed I was crying and usually looked at the knights who came to stop him with all their might.Or it\u2019s going to annoy Yufi awesome. But when I think of Yufi\u2019s face, I can\u2019t help but want to die. My heart hurts, I\u2019m going to cry, and I\u2019m going to make my nose squeal. Then I heard Tomas tongue pounding.\u201c\u2026 yeah depressing\u201d\u201c\u2026 terrible\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s terrible. Nothing but royalty and tragedy running into civilian workshops crying.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s certainly a tragedy\u2026 no, it\u2019s really depressing\u2026\u201c\u2026 uh, already. Don\u2019t apologize. So, what happened?\u201d\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201cGo home when you talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201dYou can\u2019t stay in a boulder for long. Makes me mistake that I ran in crying. It\u2019s bad for Tomas if there\u2019s a rumor. No, it might be too late. I wonder what you\u2019re really doing, me.I\u2019m going to tell Tomas about the depression but also the bump and how this happened. I know I\u2019ve had a lot of stupidity to say to Tomas, but this could have been the first time I\u2019ve ever cried. Usually I haven\u2019t even figured myself out so far\u2026Besides, I was just careful now. But I don\u2019t want anyone to touch me. It was such a complicated feeling. So I was thankful that Tomas didn\u2019t even return the hammer and just stayed there and listened.Recently, I thought Al was gone and I had to take over the throne. That\u2019s where Yuffi said he wanted to be king. When they told me I was free to chase my dreams, there was nothing I could do about it and I couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201c\u2026 so I ran away. Why did you run away? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know myself. For the first time, I\u2019m sick of being grumpy\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t want to go back. I don\u2019t want to face anyone who knows my face now. To Uffi, to Ilia, to Raini, to Father, to Mother. I just wanted to be alone. But I didn\u2019t want to be alone either.The contradictory feelings don\u2019t take shape, they circle around. I don\u2019t know anything about this. I don\u2019t even know what to do without knowing. I can only squat with my knees, I don\u2019t want to.\u201cRight. Then go home.\u201d\u201c\u2026 terrible\u201d\u201cYou, I told you I was leaving.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d\u201cLiar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201cI\u2019m scared, you are. That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re running away.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Scared?Scared, ran away? What\u2019s that? Just, that\u2019s all\u2026?\u201c\u2026 is that so simple? This.\u201dOther than that, I don\u2019t know why.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m scared if someone tells me to keep my life. Even if I cut off from my family. But I feel heavily prepared if they tell me I\u2019m going down the road I know it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s still heavy when people say it\u2019s for their dreams.\u201d\u2026 heavy preparedness, huh? That\u2019s, yeah. Yufi\u2019s readiness is heavy. Even now I know I was surprised.\u201c\u2026 Tomas.\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you making fun of me right now?\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m that Anisphere Win Palettia under the sky, right? He stormed the dragon, saying he was collecting material for the demon, and he went to fight alone\u2026 but he ran away.\u201dYufi\u2019s proclamation is goodwill. It was for me everywhere. Yet I ran away. I got scared, freaked out, couldn\u2019t take it, couldn\u2019t say anything back\u2026\u201c\u2026 no, it\u2019s not weird to run away\u201dTomas\u2019s response back is so unexpected that I look up in momentum.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe only thing that Master Ennis can stand to lose is his own. For example, if the dragon leaves now, do you want to leave alone?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not going\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not in that much of a rush for material right now. Besides, I\u2019m the only one with the right to inherit the throne now.\u201dNow, if I die from a single hit with a dragon, I won\u2019t be able to see it. So I can\u2019t reckless like that anymore. Until now, there was Al. Because Al was there, I wasn\u2019t worried that the king would be gone even if I died.But not now. I am the next king. There is none but me. The country will be disturbed without me\u2026. That\u2019s no good. If it becomes a civil conflict, many people will surely die.\u201cIf it\u2019s just me, it\u2019s good. But you can\u2019t stand the fact that other people\u2019s lives are lost because of you. Anyway, until now, you thought you had Prince Algard even if you were dead, right?\u2026\u2026\u201cBut Master Uphilia isn\u2019t. Only one, that\u2019s what I wanted from Lady Anise. I want my dreams to come true. If you snort, Master Uphilia will lose a lot of things.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s, it\u2019s scary. \u2018Cause I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to me.\u201d\u201cRight. Nobody admitted it.\u201c Make your dreams come true before you are royal. \u201cWho else could say that?\u201d\u2026 right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m scared. \u2018Cause I\u2019m royal. Nothing took precedence over that. Speaking of which, I\u2019m sorry that Ufi isn\u2019t free. Get out of the house in the first place, because what do they say?I wanted you to admit it. That\u2019s not a lie. But I didn\u2019t want to trade it for someone\u2019s life. Because I knew it wouldn\u2019t come true.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right, I can\u2019t say. Maybe I burned it because I burned it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? Did you say that to Uffi the other day?Tomas is scratching his cheek at first sight\u2026. but Yuffi decides as much as Tomas tells you? No, maybe it was just hanging up. I\u2019m sure Uffi thought about it a lot, worried about it, and decided on it. Because someone told me, what an easy determination.That eye proves it. That eye of Yufi didn\u2019t look like such a light decision. I think that\u2019s why I got barometric pressure. So much so that you want to run away.\u201c\u2026 what did I say?\u201d\u201cMaster Anis said it wasn\u2019t for the king\u2026. unless you\u201c stop \u201cMaster Ennis.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cYou know that for yourself, don\u2019t you? Not Lady Anis,\u201c Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere Wynn Palettia \u201ccries mesomethodically in a castle workshop like this?Unexpectedly there was a zero voice of distress. It hurts my heart to be poked all over the pain just now.Surely royalty doesn\u2019t cry in places like this. I don\u2019t cry in the first place. You just have to freeze your mind before you cry. No royalty needs tears. I\u2019m the one crying right now. You don\u2019t have to cry if you stop being me.\u201cI won\u2019t come here anymore if Master Anis becomes really just a royalty, and I won\u2019t do anything stupid, and I won\u2019t laugh\u2026. I didn\u2019t ask you to do that and be king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 obnoxious, I stole people\u2019s dialogue\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll steal it\u2026. You had Master Algard. Why not? I\u2019ve never heard of a queen.\u201dTell Tomas to bump his grievances\u2026. That was so sweet to regret. Happy. So in my mouth I slap haters.\u201cNeither do I. There\u2019s no way. But al-kun\u2026 al-kun was hard, too. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have specifications.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t cry, go home. Don\u2019t talk too much. If you\u2019re gonna cry, you\u2019re not here. What\u2019s so comforting about the words of the people?\u201d\u2026 will not.I\u2019m just glad you told Tomas you don\u2019t want me to be king. That\u2019s it. \u2018Cause Tomas can\u2019t do anything. There\u2019s no reason to either. Doesn\u2019t make sense if you do. That\u2019s why Tomas doesn\u2019t. I have such trust.That\u2019s why I believed it. I don\u2019t like to hang out and get dried up, only my rotten arm is a good blacksmith Tomas. I asked him for it because I thought it looked like me somewhere. That\u2019s the beginning of our relationship. There\u2019s no such thing as warm feelings there. It has nothing to do with comfort.\u201c\u2026 sorry, thanks. I was losing myself a little bit. I\u2019m coming out.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cSorry to interrupt your work.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. my next job, I\u2019m waiting for you. If you want to come out later, weave your feathers around the robe. You stand out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201dI don\u2019t know what I replied to. I end up obscuring myself. I take the robe and go back the way to the royal palace to hide. Honestly, that foothold is heavy.Scary. Words pointed out by Tomas come back to life. There is no need for Uffi to sacrifice himself. I think so from the bottom of my heart. Because Yufi is not even the next queen anymore. There\u2019s no reason to marry Al. There\u2019s no reason to take my place.I wonder why not. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know. I wonder why Uffi said he didn\u2019t want me to be king. I\u2019m free, I follow my dreams, I wonder what that will be.For the good of the people? Yeah, well, that could happen if the development succeeds. But if Uffi tries to embrace magic without radically changing current politics, that\u2019s hard, and it takes time to penetrate.My dreams are only worth it to me. I just happen to be doing it for the people, and magic is just doing it for me. I can\u2019t use magic. It\u2019s a sign for me.\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m worth it\u201dNow, don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t know what to do. Don\u2019t say that.I wonder if you could take it down when I get back. I want you to tell me it was a joke. Then Yuffi laughs at you for being a bad joke.That can\u2019t be happening, I say calmly. Yufi is serious. Besides\u2026 I\u2019ve found the advantage of Yuffi becoming royal. That made me angry.The Royal Palace did not make any particular difference. The knight on the lookout and me back made it through without a novel today.No one spoke to me. It just comes with a gaze that deals with the swelling on the far roll. What, now? Even the problem kids, they always looked at me like that. Why are you looking at pathetic things with such eyes?You told me to be king, so I had no choice. Because I am royal. That\u2019s been the case for a long time. Because I\u2019m royal, because I\u2019m royal, because I\u2019m royal! I\u2019m royal!!\u201cI am royal.\u201dSo I have no choice.Speak in your heart the words you have repeated over and over again. Let\u2019s give up. We have to give up. Give it up, I can stand it if I don\u2019t think of anything. Oh, yeah. Don\u2019t leave me half untrained.I want to get easier soon. It\u2019s like walking in the water. I\u2019m going to be unable to breathe. Still, I won\u2019t stop walking. There\u2019s no way I can stop you, because you told me to do it all the time and I can\u2019t run anymore.\u201c-\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dIf you notice, the outhouse is at the end of your eyes and nose.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Uffi was standing at the entrance.\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cWelcome back\u201dDid you wait for me? Ever since I popped up.The serene expression doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking. My legs are going to bite. Still, my legs move. You just have to ignore all of them. Tell me, tell me.Slip through the side of Uffi and enter the outer palace. At that moment, I was hugged by Uffi from behind.\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to be seen in the face, so please stay like this. If you really want to get away with it, figure it out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh,\u2026 Uffi\u201d\u201c\u2026 good\u201d\u201cWhat was good about it? You want me to laugh funny?\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so angry.\u201d\u2026 What\u2019s that? He said it was so good that I was angry.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I could intimidate you. Now if you can\u2019t even put it on your teeth, you\u2019ll have to get more excited.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what does Yufi want to do with me? You want to piss me off, make me an enemy?\u201cIt\u2019s both right and wrong. I do want to piss you off. More importantly, I don\u2019t want to see you freeze your emotions. I don\u2019t want to be an enemy, I want to be equal. If you think you\u2019re wrong, you can do everything in your power.\u201dMistake\u2026\u2026? I get angry with that word and try to unravel Yuffi\u2019s arm and turn around and face it again.\u201cMistakes!? What is wrong with you!? Freezing your emotions!? What you don\u2019t understand is Ufi! That\u2019s what kings are for!! Kings who can\u2019t kill emotions are inferior to dictators who can\u2019t be fair! That\u2019s just a tyrant!!\u201d\u201cThen you will be a tyrant. As my subordinate, I have a duty to stop it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh!\u201cCan you tell me it won\u2019t? You know what I mean. You cannot abandon that longing. [M] No matter how sealed you are, you can\u2019t throw it away. If you\u2019re disrespectful, you can take this neck.\u201d\u201cI thought I would snort anything if I shielded my life!?\u201d\u201cNo, no. It is unacceptable for me, the Duke\u2019s wife, to flatter the royal family with such shallow thoughts.\u201dUffi is straight everywhere. I\u2019m not bluffing. One step toward the will to slap him, he realizes his feet are falling back.\u201cAt the cost of this life, but I want to protect your heart. I\u2019ve decided to reach out to you that no one can reach.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s so heavy. Who asked for it? Do that to me! I didn\u2019t ask for it!\u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ve come to a point where you can\u2019t cry anymore, can you? Master Algard is gone. You are the only one. Because you\u2019re the only one. Then you can\u2019t wipe those tears without overturning that premise.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not crying! I\u2019m not crying! I\u2019ve been giving up for a long time! I can\u2019t believe this is happening without Al! I hoped it wouldn\u2019t! I was praying! Until then, no matter how foolish they were, it was rather convenient! Even if you come to your head, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s where it ended! No one expects me!! No one will look at what I wanted to be expected!!\u201dNo matter how much magic props were made, it did not come true to bury the faith of magic.I couldn\u2019t admit it, because nobody had to expect me to. I hope someone understands. That was enough. I wanted that to be enough.\u201cMe! If you say king! If you say the king deserves it\u2026 admit it! My magic! Unlike everyone else, this is my magic! I found the magic that makes everyone happy!!\u201d\u2013 Magic is a nice power to make everyone smile.So I admired it. I wanted to reach out. I couldn\u2019t stop it if I knew it existed.I knew what was not in this world, even if I had no magical talent. If we can create it, it will be magic that no one can do. Become magic for everyone.I still think so. But it won\u2019t. The way the country works, the history of the country doesn\u2019t allow it. I have the confidence to make you admit it. But I wanted to make everyone happy and I made magic, and all I could do was turn it into a spark of contention!I know you can\u2019t all be happy! Behind happiness lies misfortune! Happiness is a dream story!\u2026 Still, I can\u2019t live without dreaming.\u201c\u2026 Yes. I know. The value of your dreams. I know because you put me on your side. I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that. The richness and splendour that can be created by anyone who can take magical protection from the civilian population.\u201d\u2026 stop.\u201cI\u2019m sure you really should have been king more than anyone else. As much as your father wants. It doesn\u2019t arrive no matter how talented I get my daughter. Because you only have magic. But this country will not forgive you. Not yet, not yet. But\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s because I walk alone. I will not spare this life to protect your dreams.\u201dStop it.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be king by yourself. Instead, I\u2019ll hit it and put it on. As long as it freezes my heart, I will be there. I won\u2019t let you give up. If the title King binds you, I\u2019ll take your place. So\u2026 please don\u2019t give up on wanting to be king until you kill your worth\u201dMy breath was so painful that I didn\u2019t realize that I was stuffed with distance that I chewed my lips off the voices that seemed to pop up for no reason.They grabbed my hand. Don\u2019t miss it this time. The hand I shook off, now grab my hand.\u201cI am here. Here, on your side of the mind. With you more than anyone. To dream of you together.\u201d\u201cTell me that. What would you do if you couldn\u2019t be king?\u201d\u201cAt that time, be on your side as a stomach. Let me show you my father\u2019s acumen.\u201d\u201cIf the king doesn\u2019t like it, he can\u2019t run away.\u201d\u201cDream it over and over again then. With your dreams, I will be able to feather everywhere. Only if your magic is on your back.\u201d\u201cMy family and not my family anymore.\u201d\u201cA king is the one who guides and loves all his people. \u2026 the relationship changes, but its thoughts remain the same\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d be happy to say that\u2026?\u201cNo\u2026. I knew it would break my heart. But yes.\u201dA hand that hasn\u2019t taken my hand slips through my chest with my fingers.\u201cIf the wound put on me is more than the wound that can be put on the country in the name of the king. That I could risk my life to bury it. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Ufi is actually a hell of a confident guy?\u201cI\u2019m a Duke\u2019s Lady. As second to the royal family, this is still not enough. If it\u2019s going to come to your dreams, it\u2019s still more.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the duchess of the world is about to cry. You make me laugh\u2026\u201d\u2026 Ouch. My heart hurts so much.\u2018Cause it\u2019s heavy, like this. Likewise, they gave their lives. I know, but that\u2019s what kings are for. I knew it was something that would keep other people\u2019s lives.But that\u2019s bearable because you\u2019re a king. It\u2019s unbearable if you\u2019re not a king. So I\u2019m not the king. To me, after all, Uffi\u2019s life is heavy.\u201c\u2026 I will not give up being king. It\u2019s a duty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but Yuffi decided not to have to take my hand.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cThen we need to keep an eye on it. Because now Uffi is just a renegade minister. No choice, no choice.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t give anything back if I lose them all\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already received it\u201dUffi\u2019s hands wrapped around my hands and lifted them. Hands over each other as we pray in front of our breasts, and we gaze.\u201cDream, future, wish, and now me. Someone like a meteor who saved me the empty and gave me light that day that I just did my part. I got you something irreplaceable.\u201dThat day, I just wanted to test my night flight.It was also a coincidence that I flew into the venue of the College of Lords.I gave Yufi my hand because I just wanted to.If such a coincidence is my \u201cmagic\u201d circle, then so be it.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a big deal, Yuffi.\u201dI wonder if I could lean on it one day. Because I don\u2019t have that courage right now.But I just want to keep my hands connected. Now, that\u2019s all I need.He pressed his forehead against our hands, layered to pray. Please, don\u2019t let this connected hand get away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35: 35\u201cIlia, can you hang out with me for a second?\u201cYes?\u201dIt was night. I was calling out to Ilia to stop. Ilia looks at me with amazing eyes.\u201cDinner break. Just a little bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ha, that\u2019s unusual\u201d\u201cHey, yeah. No?\u201d\u201c\u2026 because I have trouble being stubborn like daylight. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dIlia nodded at me as I sighed. I can only smile bitterly at that reply. I\u2019ve been with Uffi since then until I calmed down, but if I calmed down, I was embarrassed and had a hard time face-to-face.You knew that too, Yufi, and when I rested early with a troubled face on my face, I stuck it in my room. Ugh, I\u2019m embarrassed you seem to be taking it by the balls, it\u2019s regrettable and honestly complicated.Invite Ilaria to my room to watch the wine prepared for Ilaria pour into the glass. Honestly, I don\u2019t drink much alcohol. It\u2019s subtle when people ask me if I\u2019m not a strong person and if I like the taste. If you\u2019re about to drink alcohol, you should be high on brain drugs\u2026\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Thanks\u2026. Shall I pour Illia\u2019s share?\u201cPlay.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s playful enough at the point where I say we drink together.\u201d\u201cSo is that.\u201dIlia prepares her own share of wine and sits in her seat. And we toast with a glass of wine. Take a bite to lick, then drink the amount through your throat and narrow your eyes.Pepper, gently tongues out. Yeah, I knew I wasn\u2019t that good at alcohol. But I had no choice because I wanted to drink it. Ilia has also reduced the amount by about half while doing so. Ilia is alcohol resistant.\u201c\u2026 sorry about the day\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I can\u2019t believe you said Uffi wanted to be king\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect it\u201dRight. I didn\u2019t think Yufi would think of that. I don\u2019t know what will actually happen, but I won\u2019t refuse Yuffi\u2019s favor anymore. If Yufi ever really becomes king, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.If I imagine such a future, I get zero weird laughs. I was so worried, in pain, I was finally going to be able to swallow it. It\u2019s going to be lightly covered by Uffi.\u201c\u2026 a little, I regret\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ilia?\u201cI was proud to say I was closest to the princess. I was reminded it was only a squire stop.\u201dIlia whines a word when she drinks up wine at once. Once again Ilia tries to pour wine into the wine glass, but first I take the wine and pour it into Ilia.Then Ilia catches her eyes and stares, but pretends she doesn\u2019t know. Pour the wine as it is, then sit back in your seat and put your mouth on the wine for yourself.\u201cIlia was like your sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that my sister\u201d\u201cYeah. He scolds me properly and makes sure I\u2019m not mistaken. I came this far because Ilia had been watching me the whole time. So thank you so much\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s like you\u2019re pretending to be fired\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not a princess anymore, fine. Even if I quit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because I\u2019m serious?I feel the intensity of Ilia\u2019s gaze has increased. I feel the wine drunkenness coming around feeling good. Staring at Ilia\u2019s face as she felt her head flutter.I think you have a really beautiful face. I don\u2019t even make you feel old. If you had the right amount of equipment, you would have had a lot to choose from. Still, being by my side must be one of my luck.\u201c\u2026 if you want to quit, yes. I want you to stay in Ilaria. But yeah. Don\u2019t tell me I did. I wonder if Ilia would like to be here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s the sudden matter\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity\u2026\u201dDrink up the leftover wine and look at Ilaria with eyes with only slightly heavier eyelids.\u201cIlia was beside me because of my self\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if the princess wished.\u201d\u201cYeah. If I can fall in love with myself, I think Ilia has taken care of me. It\u2019s a really happy thing, and I\u2019m sure it was Ilia who protected my heart the rest of my life.\u201dIn my position, my father, my mother if it\u2019s harshness, and Ilia if it\u2019s peace.Closer to me than anyone else and guided me. Someone with no changeover who served me.\u201cI really appreciate it. I think I was happy from the bottom of my heart that you dated me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a bad word.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not why\u2026 it\u2019s a good opportunity. Because I said as much as I could. I want to hear what Ilaria wants.\u201dThe reason must be whimsical. Until now, I would like to receive in words the feelings that you have shown me with your attitude. Ilia\u2019s feelings instead of responding to my very own dating.Ilia tilts the wine silently for a moment. It was as if I were choosing words. I drink like a chick and a lick of wine too.\u201c\u2026 it was me too who was spoiling the role as much as I could be given\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026?\u201cAll I could choose was to gain power for my home. Connecting with the people who deserve it. I never even thought about my worth more than that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what you saw, and it was very easy for you to live in the role you wanted. You don\u2019t just have to respect it. Instead, even disrespect is wanted, and I think it was a very difficult Lord to live as he pleases\u201dPhew. Ilia laughs as she breaks her slightly reddish cheeks with alcohol.\u201cYou wanted me. And there is now. Your happiness was my happiness and my happiness was your happiness. It would have been an honor for me not to have done so much more if I had praised it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cBut\u2026. I could not guide you even if I could protect your heart. That\u2019s something I can\u2019t do. I don\u2019t have the brains to draw the ideals, nor the power to just take your hands. She\u2019s just a maid of honor, a daughter of the same Viscount family who was banished.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what Ilaria\u2019s worth.\u201d\u201cYep. But people are greedy things\u2026. Without Master Uphilia, I wouldn\u2019t have thought so.\u201dThey gave me Yufi\u2019s name, and my heart just bounced a little. Fill the wine with deception.\u201cEven if I envy you, I can\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t compare what I\u2019ve done for you to what I\u2019ve done to save you, even though I know it should be my own\u2026 regret.\u201d\u201c\u2026 wow, me, were you loved?\u201cThe most, most beloved person in the world. My lord, Princess Anisphere. If you weren\u2019t passing it on, let me tell you something, especially with this hand?\u201cBecause I\u2019m drunk now! Stop it because it\u2019s dangerous when you get hit!Sooo, I shake my head frightened by my creepy raised hand. Damn, I just pour wine into the wine glass that Ilia emptied of me.I shrug and close my eyes, blurring at the wine that is poured.I have to apologize to Ilia.\u201c\u2026 have you been too drunk?\u201cMaybe\u2026. I was sweet on Ilaria.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it already\u201d\u201cHa, I wanted you to deny it\u2026. Somewhere, I thought I could die anytime.\u201dIf you\u2019re in Al\u2019s way, you can\u2019t even be free, and someone keeps denying you your life.No matter how useful your father finds it, it is not recognized by the nobility of this country.I wonder how much this life is worth if my existence disrupts the country.If it\u2019s not worth it, live as you please. Even after one day, oh, so I can say it was fun.Anyway\u2026 I was reborn once. Then I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no choice.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was normal. But I gave up somewhere. It\u2019s still good when your father is alive. But if Al becomes king, I\u2019m sure there will be no place for me in this country. Then I wonder if the study of magic, too, would have had to be surrounded by other countries or done secretly. So I ended up in a cage in my shell.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cIlia was like part of it for me. Naturally, even if I die, Ilaria will finish well, he said. You\u2019re an idiot, you\u2019re so rude to Ilia. I think so now. Today, when Tomas asked me, I was told that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to lose my own.\u201d\u201cTomas did that.\u201dIlia knows about Tomas, too. Though I\u2019ve never seen you talk more than business just because you know it.\u201cSo I realized. I thought it was convenient to look at Ilya. But if Ilaria cared about me, I thought it would be rude.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see\u201d\u201cMy father, my mother, I wish I had Al\u2026. Oh, I\u2019ve always been rotten.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a very greasy child.\u201d\u201cYeah. So let\u2019s close it today. Ilia.\u201dDrink up the wine Ilia poured me all at once\u2026. whose blood the wine was likened to. Talk about previous life or this world? I can\u2019t remember with a dull head of thought. But now I drink it out of sight with Ilia\u2019s blood. Because I thought it was necessary.Beloved squire who has served me so far. Who I\u2019ve been bothering. Someone like my sister who\u2019s been leaning in on me. Correct your posture and stare straight.\u201cIlia Coral. It was great that you served me to this day. Anisphere Win Palettia will never forget your devotion. I would like to reward you once and for all. Tell me what you want. Talk as much as you can if you want to flourish. If you wish to be fulfilled, I will bless you with all my might.\u201dYou\u2019ve been the reason I\u2019ve had my life connected.Happy being beside me, happy just being beside me. Let\u2019s end this here today. I can\u2019t live like soaking in warm water anymore. It was so cozy, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s over.I\u2019m not running anymore. If Yuffi really should be king, let\u2019s give in, let\u2019s set that environment up. If Yufi can\u2019t reach me and I should be, I\u2019ll be king with my chest up. To protect this country that anyone who loved me tried to protect.\u201c\u2026 with extra honor, this Ilia, I am grateful\u201dStanding in a chair, Ilia kneels before me. Waiting for Ilia\u2019s words, staring down at her lowered head.\u201cReward,\u201d he said. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re allowed to do\u2026 again, I\u2019d like to serve you forever. \u201c\u201c\u2026 is that all you need?\u201cFor eternity, I said. You are irreplaceable. It wasn\u2019t your identity, it was your personality that made me want to be on your side. Are you\u2026\u201dIlia slowly looks up,\u2026 a little lost face, then stands up and stops by my side.I can wrap my cheeks with both hands so I can lift them and gaze at them. Ilaria had a smile she\u2019d never seen before.\u201cYou were my treasure. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you to do anything more than be happy.\u201d\u201cIlia\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe was a really laborious kid. My best, no clapping, and I\u2019m going to have to keep my eyes open. That\u2019s why I was allowed to be on your side, too. It was above all forgiveness to me. It was what I meant by living. If you die, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t hate it.\u201dBite your lips. Because otherwise there was going to be a weird voice. Oh, I knew, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201cIf you mean reward, I will return the life I have deposited with you. I don\u2019t want to die for you. Even if you die, I swear I will think of you and I will mourn you.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s a far-flung threat\u2026! You threaten to keep resenting me if I die\u2026!\u201cIf you want to make me happy, keep living. If it\u2019s hard to live because you\u2019re not happy, please be happy\u2026. If they thought I was their sister, I really don\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201dI, too, think the same thing.The hand that was wrapped around my cheek is turned to my head and held tight.Huh, and. My voice leaked out of my mouth. Bad. Bad, Ilia.Now, if you say that and they hold you tight, you\u2019re going to cry.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s all right now. You have Uphilia. I, Raini, Your Majesty and Queen are there. It\u2019s enough to count with one hand, isn\u2019t it comforting?\u201c\u2026 yeah. Enough to hold my fist.\u201d\u201cPlease stand. Please move forward and reach out happily. Ilia vows to keep an eye on its back. Even if you go far away. As a landmark to remember where you\u2019re going. As your sister\u2019s replacement.\u201d\u201c\u2026 will Ilia be happy with that?\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you need to worry anymore\u2026 right. Let\u2019s increase my happiness again. Raining Raini has also become fun. I was wondering if it would be a good future to be the first to grow your own.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Reach out to Ilia\u2019s back. Hold Ilia tight so she can catch him, and bury him in the face.\u201c\u2026 I love it\u201d\u201cI know you do.\u201d\u201cHey, Ilia. Say it from your mouth.\u201d\u201cWhat is it\u201d\u201cCan I be happy?I wonder if I can live with what I want. I wonder if I can want to change the world.Because this world is cramped and boring. We all have magic, but we only look at it when we\u2019re in a position of right. Even magic studies are full of faith and theology. No matter if anyone tries to extremes magic, they don\u2019t even try to pursue what magic is.Wonder if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like to know about. Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m a reincarnator in the root part. So the world I want is far away.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. Ilia will be with you then.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor\u2026. please go ahead, don\u2019t you?\u201cTerrible. I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d\u201cI trust you\u201dThen let\u2019s win both credibility and trust. Then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be happy.\u201cThank you, Ilia\u201d\u201cYes, Master Anisphere\u201dThe wine still tastes on my tongue. Even if I wanted to get drunk, I wasn\u2019t good at the taste of alcohol.But this flavour is special. So even if I\u2019m not good at it, I think I\u2019ll remember it all the way ahead.\u201cLainey, can I ask for your help?\u201cAre you using it? Yes, what do you use?The next day, after breakfast, I was calling Raini and handing him a letter. Raini stops by me once and for all to receive a letter.\u201cApply for an interview with your father and mother. I\u2019m not in a hurry, so please let me know for your convenience.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in awe. Then you will come to the royal palace.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been working out a little lately!Raini laughs innocently as she makes her fists with both hands. Well, in our position, if we can\u2019t defend ourselves somewhat, we\u2019re in trouble. You can defend yourself if you remove the shackles of Raini\u2019s mental interference, but don\u2019t forbid it at the same time that you\u2019re your wife.I\u2019ll take a look at it for you once in a while. I know a little about personal protection, but I remember my arm. Yeah, but you said Ilia was starting to enjoy growing Raini, so I guess I shouldn\u2019t give it a bad little bit?\u201c\u2026 are you interviewing Your Majesty and the Queen?Yufi, who was sitting face to face, raises a voice of doubt. I snort, too, to meet Yufi\u2019s doubts.\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s officially pass on Yuffi\u2019s intentions to Father and Mother as well\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really? You\u2019re nervous about boulders.\u201d\u201cRight. Neither do I. I don\u2019t know if these two will snort happily.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t normally give a king a name, would I? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what Uffi said, not me. I guess it flips, Father.I wonder about your mother. I know you\u2019re gonna listen to me, but I think I\u2019m gonna get another headache. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re all in trouble, no, Uffi\u2019s a super good kid.Then Raini came back after depositing his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s replies. Unexpectedly, the two of them took the time to get a meeting today.Familiarise yourself by Ilia and Raini, then leave Ilia at the voicemail for me and Ufi and Raini to the royal palace.\u201cWaiting for you, Dear Anisphere\u201d\u201cOh, Chief Sprout Knights\u201dIt was the Knights of Sprout who welcomed us. Give them a thank you and then look at each other.I heard you wanted to talk to me in confidence, and you asked me to join you.\u201cYep. If that\u2019s what your father decided, thank you.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026. that\u2019s Baroness Cyan.\u201dHitachi Sprout, the Knights Commander, turns his gaze to Raini. For a moment, Raini almost atrophied, but quickly regained his mind and stretched his spine.\u201c\u2026 my son has caused you a great deal of trouble\u201d\u201c\u2026 Raini, the Knights of Sprout know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I am rather sorry for the inconvenience caused by that verse\u201d\u201cUhm. Then let\u2019s say we water each other with that apology\u2026. I also want you to meet my son when you get a chance. He\u2019s still worried about how to cut off the untrained.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. Not right away, though. Be sure to be close.\u201dReini returns it to the Knights of Sprout with perseverance. Navre, I wonder if you\u2019re still being discreet. I don\u2019t even know if they told me the truth, and I hope I\u2019m not depressed.Apologies are in order. I was taken by the Knights of Sprout to my room for an interview. Your father and mother were already waiting, and there were other Lord Grants there.\u201cWell done, Anis, and Uphilia\u2026. So, what? What did you do, send out a letter and ask for an interview?Is that the first voice, Father? No, it\u2019s definitely important, but I\u2019m not the one who did it. I wouldn\u2019t deny it if they told me it was a day to day thing, but come on!\u201cI\u2019d like you to think I\u2019ve changed my mind, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 have you eaten anything bad?\u201cAren\u2019t you really rude?\u201cWhere else have you been so rude?\u201dIt\u2019s me, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201cYour Majesty, Anis\u201d\u201cUgh, um. \u2026 then, go to your seats. Why don\u2019t we talk?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCoho, and his coughing mother stares at us, and Father urges us to take a seat. Me and Uffi take their seats and stand behind them as Raini refrains.Behind his father and mother stands Lord Grants and the Knights of Sprout. Thus began today\u2019s interview.\u201cFather, Mother. I have something to say from Anisphere, and thank you for your time.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let your spine get itchy\u2026. So, what\u2019s the point?\u201cI was awed at the corner\u2026\u2026 well, that\u2019s fine. Father, mother. Would you be angry if I told you I didn\u2019t want to be king now?I wondered if they would yell at me, and my father and mother shut up against my expectations.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re a fool, but you don\u2019t know it won\u2019t come true.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 all I have to say is that you can\u2019t hold the throne. No matter how much you cry.\u201dFather tells him to be quiet. My mother nods quietly next door. Well, that\u2019s right. Don\u2019t yell at me. I want to think it must be your father\u2019s kindness trying to teach me.\u201cSo if I recommended a king other than me, I\u2019d still be angry?\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cFather, Mother\u2026. Aren\u2019t you going to adopt Yufi?To my words, my father and mother opened their eyes in amazement. The two men standing in the back were also reacting in contrast.The Knights of Sprout opened his eyes just like his fathers, and Lord Grants lay quietly down his eyes.\u201cYour Majesty, the Queen. I know this is a sudden surprise, but I need you to listen to me.\u201dTry to keep up with my words. Uffi keeps up the words. To convey my thoughts to my father and mother. That gaze looked that way, even as he looked at the two of them, pointing them at his father, Lord Grants.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: 36What I cut out and Uffi talks about is the desire I have. The thought that you should not make me king and the advantages if you get the throne. Of course, I\u2019ll tell you all I can think about when I couldn\u2019t be king.My father, listening to Yufi, always looked difficult. My mother is distracted, but she still squeezes her expression to listen. The Knights of Sprout show confusion but remain silent, and Lord Grants has the same faceless expression.\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming\u2026\u201dAfter Uffi had finished talking, he opened for a little while and then his father exhaled deeply, trying to keep his body behind his back. And I look up at the ceiling just a little bit, and I close my eyes.How much would I have done that? I felt a long time of silence. Father didn\u2019t say anything, he just doesn\u2019t move with his eyes closed.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Grants\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Your Majesty\u201d\u201cThe rest, I think, is impudent.\u201dWaking himself up, his rising father turns back to Lord Grants, who had refrained behind him. I can\u2019t see that face because you turned your back on us.\u201c\u2026 Your Majesty. We, the Duke, are ready to offer ourselves to the kingdom.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026. forgive me, Grants. The rest, I always pretend to be your devotion.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let them ask you stupid things. It is the result of His Majesty\u2019s reign. Whether I\u2019m happy or not, I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s impudent.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how many young kids\u2026\u201dMy father, who returned his words to Lord Grants without strength, looks back. There was a tired look on his face like he\u2019d given up.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Uphilia. I only took your advice.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cBut. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s still premature to admit it. Spirit covenant, indeed, that is a feat that the First King exchanged. It can lead to the legitimacy of the road to the throne. But there\u2019s no reason why it should be you.\u201dSo Father shifts his gaze to me. I take my father\u2019s gaze straight.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Anis\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you resent the rest? After giving birth to someone without magic.\u201d\u201cNo, not even my hair.\u201d\u201cThen while you draw the\u201d possibility \u201d\u2026 resent the remainder of keeping you away from the spiritual covenant?To that, I had to stop the words, too. My father kept his spiritual covenant away from me. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know it if you say so.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Uphilia. It would be the same if you gave the\u201d Spirit Contract \u201d. Then everyone will recognize you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but Father. My research suggests that spiritual covenants are probably impossible for me.\u201d\u201cNot even like you! Did you demonstrate that?\u201c\u2026 no\u201dI didn\u2019t actually try it. I\u2019ve never even looked at it from a real example. I am merely speculating that it is impossible at the moment, and whether that is really impossible is not enough when it comes to verifying it.I\u2019m not saying I wasn\u2019t interested. But if you still think that you didn\u2019t stick to the spiritual covenant because of your father\u2019s strong opposition, you can convince yourself.I found a reason to give up myself. So I never looked at the means by which magic might normally be available.\u201cThe rest, I wanted to keep you away from the throne.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Father\u201d\u201cIt is Algard who will be king when a boy is born more than his ex. I was afraid that the wiser you were, the rougher the country would be. For example, you could have linked yourself to a powerful nobleman and targeted a king. I also thought about leaving the country before that. The rest\u2026 I was afraid of you, Anisphere. So in case there is, I don\u2019t want you to be able to use magic properly. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\u2026 Unexpectedly, my breath trembled.I was surprised too when I realized you were holding my fist with nature.\u201cIt still seemed loving that you were my daughter because you were smart. You turned away the throne yourself and did not have too much power, but you helped me reign. That you delivered the voice of the people is not something anyone can do. It was you who received the voice of the people and showed me what to do.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cLaugh but good, Anisphere. I used you above all else, in fear of you. The name Father is a decorative, just a king. I was only a king. If you were inclined to magic, if I recognized its value, you would have soaked up there. It was convenient.\u201d\u2026 Oh well. So, as a family, you feel the wall, and as a boss, it\u2019s convenient.It hasn\u2019t always been that way. It was what I thought. My father was only a king. Against me all the time, I\u2019ve always been king.\u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient, it\u2019s good to deprive you of your freedom in the name of the royal family. Until then, throw it away.\u201d\u201cAs a king, it was necessary. Even praising the decision, resentment, etc. And as a father, I don\u2019t want you to think of me as a flirt, Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cWho has the fool to let the king do the scratching! I want you not to make me look like a rare fool that far!\u2026 the place froze.What\u2019s your father talking about, Koz? He\u2019s got a face, and Uffi puts his hand on his forehead and exhales. The Knights of Sprout are blowing out as much as they want, and Lord Grants is poking him with his elbow and hastily retightening his expression.Raini also blows up in the back and feels signs he\u2019s rushing to fix it. My mother is so open with her eyes open. I keep coughing like I\u2019m trying to fix the place.\u201cThat\u2019s because he was my father. Besides, I thought you handled it like a proper princess when you were king.\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201cI mean it! So Father, Father was making you look like a proper father. Maybe that\u2019s what it looks like, but it makes sense to be seen that way, and it\u2019s worth it to think that way. I wasn\u2019t behaving to wait for His Majesty the King to scratch! He was sweet because he was my father!That\u2019s what I mean. I\u2019m not going to wave the king around on the boulder either. I was going to do something right. Yes, it\u2019s just that even if your father was the king and your father was behaving as king, even if he was afraid of me. What the hell is wrong with that?\u2026 To be honest, I\u2019m not convinced in terms of emotion. But there\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m not convinced of.\u201cIf I resent you, it\u2019s just that you took magic from me.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you were most thirsty for?\u201cThat\u2019s a misunderstanding. I didn\u2019t want to be able to use magic. I wanted to be a wizard.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t convey my intentions. How is it different?\u201d\u201cFor me magic isn\u2019t\u201c purpose, \u201cit\u2019s\u201c means. \u201cThe magic I had in mind was flying. A feat no one has yet accomplished, and what happens if we can fly. I\u2019ve shown my father what it\u2019s worth.\u201d\u201c\u2026 improved transport convenience, accompanied by logistical developments\u201d\u201cYes. To me magic is a means of making someone smile. I am certainly dissatisfied with the fact that the magic itself was taken away. But that\u2019s why I went down the path of magic, and now I am. It\u2019s hard for me to think that I was\u2026 unhappy or something.\u201dThat\u2019s all, that\u2019s all. Make me angry, Father.\u201cDidn\u2019t you, above all, recognize my worth? Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Anisphere\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be king. I didn\u2019t want to vandalize the country. But still, there\u2019s something I can do without being king, and I kept inventing in magic, hoping to help you, help the people. You and your mother were the first to recognize the value of the Wizards that I admired in denying them. Whatever that intent may be. I didn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201dNo matter who doesn\u2019t admit it, I would have been glad if my parents would have been happy.If it wasn\u2019t even there, I\u2019d be too miserable. At least I thought you were admitted.\u201cWas my value just sympathy? Then don\u2019t play witch mountain games. I\u2019ll have to punch you in the side.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if that makes you feel better\u201d\u201cAre you an idiot! Why aren\u2019t you trying to discuss it! I told you to keep your father\u2019s heart open and that I would not aim for the throne, please do not raise Al-kun as a priority! Didn\u2019t you assert yourself with me! I was flashy for that, but I thought you couldn\u2019t! Because you didn\u2019t say so, and now you\u2019re sinking on your own and regretting it?\u201cMm, mmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt pisses me off! I\u2019m mad at you. I am! That I didn\u2019t trust anything! I was convinced! Do you want to make me so miserable that I didn\u2019t have to tell you everything and I thought it was something I could do as a daughter to be convinced!?\u201dReally miserable! I thought it would be hard to say the truth because my father is a king, and it would be hard to say things to me, even though I turned my mind! No, maybe it\u2019s out of line to be angry because I used it too, but if you say that, it\u2019s war, Father!\u201cNever! With my guilt! Don\u2019t be confused! We did make sense without words, and no, it was a little sporadic, but, uh, for what? It\u2019s a little hard to judge, but I thought you came walking with me!\u201cThat\u2019s good enough. Don\u2019t talk, you fool! I feel sorry for you just listening!Father groans as he hands on his forehead like a headache. Because I say stupid things!\u201cFather did his best. It\u2019s just that things were too unexpected to have the art of coping\u2026. and the technique of solving happened to be in our hands. That\u2019s all it is. Then, Father, as king, you can only order. If you still don\u2019t feel well, say something to me as my father.\u201d\u201c\u2026 as king, as father?\u201cI\u2019d be fine with either, if Father cares\u201dTake my word for it. Father pushes silence. Then after a deep sigh, Father turned his tired eyes to me.\u201cAnis, how could it be Uphilia\u2026 at least something that Uphilia wouldn\u2019t have thought of so far if she wasn\u2019t the other guy!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Yes?\u201cIt is still good for Uphilia to be king. No, rather, in the sense that I won\u2019t make you king, it\u2019s best to raise your hands and welcome them! That\u2019s where Algard\u2019s engagement was originally intended! But in order to do that, we have to take Uphilia from Grants! Don\u2019t you know how much I can\u2019t get my head up on Grants!?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!? Why did the story roll over there!?\u201dI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s bouldering. Why did you talk to me?\u201cBullshit! You couldn\u2019t even educate Loc with me. It\u2019s hard to tell you to do the king! Think of all my hard work that will stop me from getting my head up on Grants!\u201cI don\u2019t know. Is that so!? And what?!? What\u2019s that misleading way of saying it!\u201cWhat a misunderstanding! I thought you said if you were going to fall in love for a long time, you\u2019d be a girl!\u2026 I said\u2026 I did say it!\u201cNo, hey, uh, no\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how I relate to Uffi!What are they misunderstanding, Father!?\u201c\u2026 Uphilia?\u201c\u2026 ha. Well, I\u2019m prepared to dedicate my life. I was wondering if it would be different if you said so.\u201dI say with a troubled look on her face somewhere, with Ufiria putting her hand on her cheek. Then Father opened his eyes.\u201cWhat is it!?\u2026 or do you keep making me mistake! You stupid girl!\u201cThere are elements that piss me off right now!?\u2026 There you are!!\u201dIf you say that from time to time, you certainly can\u2019t help but think so! Yeah!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Then my mother, who had remained silent until now, threw a quiet inquiry at me.\u201c\u2026 so, anise. What about it, actually?\u201cYes, Mother?\u201cLeaving aside your perceptions, it just seems to me that Yuffi came to you to marry you.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026No, wait, wait. Hot as a fire on my face all at once. Cover your face and squat.That\u2019s what I see, I see it!? No, I see it\u2026 I see it!?\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent in the law for marriage on the same sex. But this isn\u2019t a de facto dowry? Anis.\u201d\u201cNo, come on, Mother\u201d\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Indeed, as a queen, let us say that it is the muscle that will allow you to fulfill your spiritual covenant and use magic before you are able to speak of the throne. But I see that Uphilia has the qualities to make up for it. Honestly, I even think it\u2019s a good idea to make up your mind.\u201d\u201cWow, my feelings.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be king, do you?I shut my mouth unexpectedly to inquire in my mother\u2019s tender voice.\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be. Because that\u2019s the same heart after all.\u201cIt is a bold hand to welcome Uphilia to my royal family for this reason, but even as an individual if it can be used as a shield for legitimacy. It\u2019s not painful to take Uphilia away from the Duke of Magenta for that\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking how you feel.\u201d\u201cDuh, why?\u201d\u201cYou said you\u2019d make Uphilia happy, didn\u2019t you?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I told you,\u201d\u201cUphilia says she\u2019ll be happy to be next to you, even if she\u2019s cut off from her family, right? Whatever your thoughts, are you prepared to reward them? Annis, you know the weight of becoming king better than anyone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it is, though\u201d\u201cIf your feelings are not for Uphilia, if Uphilia is going to be royal, I must advise her to make a fianc\u00e9e. Whether you\u2019re king or Yuffi is king, the inheritance problem hasn\u2019t been solved.\u201dTo Uffi, my fianc\u00e9e? Again? Yes, the inheritance problem hasn\u2019t been solved whether I am or Ufi.\u2026 it is.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cUffi suffered scattered. I decided to protect Yuffi from the burden of being hurt. If it\u2019s someone Yufi chooses for herself, it\u2019s good if that\u2019s a good person. But if not, I won\u2019t allow it. That\u2019s the atonement that the royal family has made to Uffi, and I don\u2019t want Uffi to think that without making amends.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s no problem.\u201dMy mother speaks up softly\u2026. That, I don\u2019t know, this unpleasant feeling.\u201cIf you set a precedent for Yuffi entering the royal family, you will also be able to take your prospective children as adoptive children. The premise of a spiritual covenant will be necessary, but it will be a challenge for you to work out. If you can\u2019t accomplish that, you\u2019ll have to turn to them and give birth to an heir.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mother\u201d\u201cOr if you\u2019re just going to let me retire\u2026 maybe I\u2019ll try my best too. It would be desirable if he were my brother.\u201d\u201cYes!?\u201d\u201cSay what, Sylphine!?\u201dMy father\u2019s barbaric voice overlapped. Does that mean your mother\u2019s gonna have a baby now? No, no, \u2019cause even your mother\u2019s getting pretty old, and you don\u2019t know if you can do it, do you? It\u2019s also a question of whether you can give it to me safely and have it!?\u201cOrphans, brace your belly. Sure, I\u2019m old too, but now I have anispheres. I will also be able to find ways to withstand childbirth.\u201d\u201cNo, it is, but\u201d\u201cWhat do you do with all the burden on your children! The first step is for parents to fulfil their responsibilities as parents. We miseducated our children. If the parents don\u2019t take the blame, who will!My mother drank it and my father was sad enough to flaunt my shoulder. No, I do look if they tell me to find a way\u2026!\u201cIf I could set up another son, I would also have a proposal to make Anis or Yufi king of the inner connection. It\u2019s time to prepare the means, Orphans. Or will you have a concubine now?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t intend to\u201d\u201cIf so, please do your part. I was also clouded by the cuteness of my child when I realized that my eyes had not yet been clouded.\u201dMy father looks sinister at my mother\u2019s words. Well, Father loves Mother. If you say you don\u2019t like being called concubine now, I don\u2019t know how you feel\u2026\u201cIt won\u2019t be too late for Uphilia to be king after all his hands have been put out. It\u2019s not like I want to take my child away from my parents. That\u2019s good, Grants!\u201cHa, as the queen pleases.\u201d\u201cMatthew, you too! I\u2019ll be working for the Kingsguard Knights from now on. Don\u2019t let me tell you I\u2019m a dull castle worker.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dMatthew, known as the Knights of Sprout, stretches his spine.The air on the field was taken to my mother at once. So confused, my mother takes her seat and walks up to me.\u201cParents travel before their children. I thought you guys would be left\u2026 but there seems to be a lot left to do. It\u2019s not going to be easy to hide.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mother\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you raised, your parents take responsibility for it\u2026. but Anisphere. You are responsible too. That\u2019s a responsibility you have to fulfil before you can be royal. And the first thing I should have done to you as a parent.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what would that be?\u201cBe happy,\u201d he said. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna teach you. We are a royalty, a symbol, and we cannot escape being bound. We did teach you to admonish, but we didn\u2019t bother to teach you because we thought you were made of nature. We don\u2019t live to be tied up, we live to grasp happiness in our hands. \u201cMy mother\u2019s hands wrap my cheeks. My mother has a pale grin that seeps through her regrets.That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s what you wanted to tell Al.\u201cYou loved us. I really didn\u2019t know you cared that much. Because I thought it was vegan. You\u2019re a liar, but you were never a tough kid. No, I\u2019m sure she was the one who had to put her hands on it.\u201d\u201cSuch a thing\u2026\u201d\u2018Cause I\u2019ve been a childless kid since I had memories of my previous life, Brad.He could certainly have been an overdone kid. Because you can\u2019t do magic, think about giving the throne to Al, and behave like that.\u201cYou were not a child to be tied to. You just looked free and made it look that way in your forgiveness.\u201d\u201cNo, it was vegan too\u2026\u201d\u201cThen our eyes would have been cloudy not realizing the kindness of caring for others. You\u2019ve lived like that for the people, for us, for Algard. It\u2019s too tragic to tie you up like this.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to think of it that way. I was free enough to do it, and I didn\u2019t think I was unhappy. Sure, I\u2019ve thought of it as cramped, because that\u2019s normal as royalty.But there are no objections. Are you not sure you can tell me well, or did I, really, just want you to say that and admit it?\u2026 \u2018Cause can you say you\u2019re sweet? I don\u2019t think so, normal. Because being nice to others was normal.\u201cSo look a little further in the face of Uphilia\u2026. you seem blunt to other people\u2019s feelings and your feelings?My mother\u2019s words whispered so in my ear, and the fever on my cheek, which was about to cool down again, soared.Face Uffi. Well, I wonder what that means to face it. Making me think about what that means again, I was unintentionally stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: 37\u201c\u2026 Together, the story goes out of line a lot but communicates the rest of the decision. Anisphere, it\u2019s Uphilia. I give you my life.\u201d\u201cKing\u2019s life, is it?\u201cMm-hmm. Either way, you can\u2019t cut off the spiritual covenant. I order you to study and elucidate the spiritual contract from the point of view of the researchers of magic.\u201dIn other words, from the King, it becomes a study and study of spiritual covenants duly authorised by the State. It is very difficult for you to say this from your father.Until now, magic has been nothing but my way of doing things. Results are not officially recognized as a country. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the first historic feat that your father has asked you to be king.\u2026 nature and mind exalt. Whatever you say, it\u2019s a pleasure for me that Father appreciates magic.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Anis\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI asked for it.\u201dThat\u2019s all, really enough.I thank my father deeply. Whatever the consequences, now I\u2019m not afraid of anything anymore. When I became king, I thought my heart was something I had to kill. He said there was only dictatorship to set him free.If I changed my perspective a little, I would have noticed. I\u2026 well, it seems everyone\u2019s taking care of me. I guess I\u2019ll just have to grow up a little bit in the future. Even in the sense of reassuring.\u201cLet\u2019s make sure we can meet with the spiritual contractors in our country soon\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201cUhm\u2026. but because I\u2019m secular away from you in a different way. It might break my bones a little bit. Not right away. You guys are gonna do what you can by then, right?\u201cYes! Of course it is!There\u2019s plenty to do. Let\u2019s first formally request the Ministry of Magic to disclose the materials. Heh heh, we have a royal life here! The king\u2019s life! The king\u2019s words will never be!\u2026 Well, we also have to do something about our relationship with the Ministry of Magic. Are you busy with the restructuring because the Chartreuse family, which has been at the top of your list, has fallen? I didn\u2019t really think it was a good idea for me to poke, so I was deciding to be static, hmm. I was wondering if I\u2019d bite a bit to get the dossier out.\u201cUphilia, may I have a moment?Yes, my queen.When I was talking to my father, Uffi was taken by my mother and left the room\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m just curious because there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been talking about. haven\u2019t blown weird things in, have you, Mother?!?As I was a little worried and exploring the signs at the end of the door, I hardened my posture when I noticed Lord Grants dropping by nearby. Ugh, a little awkward on the boulder\u2026\u2026!\u201cG, Lord Grants\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess Anisphere. Can I talk to you for a second?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be hard on yourself. It\u2019s about Yufi.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dThis is scary\u2026\u2026! It\u2019s so intimidating\u2026\u2026! No, the signs aren\u2019t that harsh, but I still have pressure on my eyes just to be normal. My eyes are too strong.\u201cWhen she said she didn\u2019t want you to be king, she replied that she was loyal\u2026. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201cThat is loyal, but to say loyal\u2026 some, the color of emotion is deep. If you think of my daughter as a straight line, I miss her a little bit.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 what is that?\u201cThe blood muscles of my Magenta family, once burned, until later burned out\u2026. Please, thank my daughter again\u201d\u201cWhat!? What!? What do you mean, Lord Grants!?\u201dHow can they laugh at such fun and leave disturbing words behind!? That\u2019s what the Magenta family is all about!?Or don\u2019t really leave. Why are you laughing and leaving! Lord Grants, Lord Grants!?\u201cFather up!? What the hell does that mean?!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 the history of the Duke of Magenta family is old. You know that too.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s no more\u201d\u201cRemember that even when the blood of the royal family diminishes, it was part of the royal family, and I am proud to be born of the historic Duke family. And if it is hereditary or loyal, many thick are born. But if your thoughts burn, then you\u2019re stubborn.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is that?\u201cI can\u2019t get my head up on Grants, because\u2026 he\u2019s my best friend and my brother\u2019s kind of opponent. I\u2019ve been taking care of you for a long time.\u201d\u201cAt the time, I gathered around His Majesty Orphans as the ruler of the rugged kingdom of Palletia, but I didn\u2019t go sailing smoothly.\u201d\u201cHead of the Sprout Knights!The Sprout Knights captain, who has been mixed up in conversation at some point, is smiling bitterly.Speaking of which, my mother used to call me names, but actually, you know, dating since then?\u201cHis Majesty Orphans is somewhat hard-working and has gentle sexual roots. Besides once it sinks in, it\u2019s muddy. Ha ha ha, how many times Lord Grants was yelling at me and slapping me in the butt!\u201cMatthew! You!\u201cBesides, I came next door with Master Silphine. I miss you even when you couldn\u2019t stay weak, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThat kind of thing was used by Grants and Silphine with their jaws!\u201cIt was more peaceful than His Majesty, who had been slapped in the butt and stirred up with pneumonia.\u201dOh, it\u2019s in my eyes. If your father messes with you, Lord Grants and your mother are pulling you out and letting you stand on the arrow. There was also a Sprout Knights Commander there, hmm\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat Lord Grants wanted to say was that the House of the Duke of Magenta would never betray the loyal opponent it once decided to do. No matter how low you stand, if you decide you deserve the letter. Miss Uffilia said she was drawing the blood of the Duke of Magenta.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201d\u201cIf this is a same-sex opponent, I would settle into a pattern like a good friend or brother, like His Majesty and Lord Grants\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 hmm?\u201c\u2026 Uphilia\u2019s loyalty has a strong color of affection, unlike his own. I mean, you wanted to say it wasn\u2019t just loyalty. Grants is.\u201dHa, and sigh and father rubs his eyebrows loose\u2026. after all, is that what they\u2019re looking at you for?! or even from your parents, yuffi!?\u201cAs a Princess Anisphere, don\u2019t you wish or fulfill?\u201cNo, no, no!\u2026 I did say girls are good for a long time!\u201cWhat is it, is it not clear?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t that strange? Normally, I thought they\u2019d never come out the same way.\u201dI wondered if there would be a concubine or something! That\u2019s not true! It\u2019s kind of like a pet, and I don\u2019t think love means anything! So honestly, it\u2019s unrealistic.Ugh, uhh, roaring, then I turned my gaze to one of my dependents in shame.\u201cRaini!\u201d\u201cHih. Hey, what is it?\u201c\u2026 Doesn\u2019t Ufi feel like that\u2019s just loyalty\u2026?\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dWhy are you looking at such a pathetic creature, Raini? Stop, stop that raw, warm gaze!\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I recommend that you discuss this with Master Uphilia.\u201d\u201cDuh, I don\u2019t know what to look like\u2026\u201dRaini, your father sent me a seemingly pathetic gaze. I can\u2019t solve it.Don\u2019t slap me on the shoulder with a bitter smile, Captain Sprout Knights. It\u2019s breaking my heart.\u201cYes, women are brave!I\u2019ve tried to worry about it since I got back out of the palace, but I don\u2019t get an answer. I didn\u2019t confess to Yuffi in the first place, and I didn\u2019t confess from me.Though they did say something like a proposal, and they also said they don\u2019t mind devoting their whole lives! If you hadn\u2019t told me you still were, we wouldn\u2019t have established the facts!So if you\u2019re bored, you just have to ask him directly! So if that\u2019s not what you mean, then that\u2019s fine!\u2026 maybe.No, no, but what if even Uffi still feels halfway and doesn\u2019t know which way to fall? Doesn\u2019t that make you awkward? Me. No, but it\u2019s honestly awkward as it is now\u2026Ha!? Kuh, my thoughts are twisted again\u2026\u2026 this doesn\u2019t suit me! Repeat! Women are brazen! You just have to hit it and smash it!\u201c\u2026 Yu, Yufi? Still awake?It was sometime in the night while I was stuffy and troubled. Yufi visited my room at night, but this may be the first time she\u2019s visited from me.Hey, did you fall asleep? Yufi sleeps well, so I might just go to bed at night. \u2018Cause he looks like an honorable student, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be mad at Ilia all night long or anything like me\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis?My heart bounced loudly on my voice coming back from across the door. I want to turn right. What are you gonna do, run away here? Me! Or you have no reason to run! Uh, I don\u2019t know anymore. No!I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. I won\u2019t leave you behind! Ask Uffi the answer and you\u2019ll see! Think afterwards! The second repetition! Woman! Breast!\u201cHa, I\u2019m coming in!\u201cEh.\u201dWhen I entered the room before waiting for Yuffi\u2019s reply, I met Yuffi, who was distraught when I stood up. Oh, this is as embarrassing as I thought.I look at Yuffi with my back hand closed to delude him. Duh, brains!\u201c\u2026 heh, heh\u2026!\u201cWow\u2026 they laughed\u2026!Even though I looked funny like that, Yuffi began to laugh as she hid her mouth and bent her back. Ugh, shut up! I thought it was funny, too!\u201cTell me and I\u2019ll open it\u2026 Welcome, Dear Anis\u201d\u201cUgh, yeah.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, next door.\u201dAnd, next door. I was just about to get out of bed, and, uh, maybe you were asleep?Awkward as I thought. He said he was brainless, but I shouldn\u2019t want to bother you\u2026\u2026!\u201cOh, did I wake you?\u201cNo. I was still blind. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s tea here in Anise\u2019s room\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, fine\u2026. next door, sit down.\u201dTake your breath and never sit next to Uffi with your will. It\u2019s no less comfortable than the bed in my room. It seems true to say it\u2019s before bed, and Yuffi\u2019s hair is usually tied down with a half-up as well.There is no agitation in Yufi\u2019s expression. Rather, as usual as I float, I even feel my guts shrivel. I can\u2019t beat you! I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna lose, but I\u2019m not gonna lose!\u201c\u2026 do you care that much? What the Queen told me.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dIt\u2019s going to be broken at the opening. Rather broken. My nose was frustrated and my guts shriveled.\u201c\u2026 you feel sorry for me?\u201cNo. I think Master Anis has a weakness in the crowd too\u2026 I think she\u2019s cute, don\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen Uffi say he\u2019s cute.\u201dIt\u2019s been a freak, weirdo, weirdo, three beats before. No, I\u2019m not really complimented. I\u2019ve always been told to disqualify royalty\u2026\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t Uffi annoying? Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see with me.\u201d\u201cAre you going to ask that now?\u201cNo, I am\u2026\u201dI did, maybe even more now. \u2018Cause I\u2019ve always been around to say I like girls, and I can\u2019t deny when people tell me that\u2019s the intention that surrounded Uffi, and I did prefer Uffi!\u201c\u2026 I was aware of the boulder. About the fact that I\u2019m changing. So, no one like me would be in a boulder.\u201d\u201cYou never get romantic feelings about the same sex, do you?\u201c\u2026 yeah. Especially among the nobles. I have to give birth to a heir.\u201d\u201cLady Anis is usually imprisoned in common sense in a habit that doesn\u2019t have a thump.\u201dI guess. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m changing myself, and I don\u2019t feel so imprisoned by common sense, but I\u2019m not sure there. I was never conscious. I can also say I didn\u2019t need to be aware\u2026\u201cI admire Lord Anis\u2026 but honestly, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s romantic emotion.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, yeah\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been in love in the first place, so there\u2019s no comparison. I do hear love stories and such, but it doesn\u2019t mean that my feelings overlap there.\u201dOh, shit. Safe, like eating a shoulder watermark. Whatever it was, I lost my temper, stroked my chest down and exhaled.Gun, and his body was pulled back and looking up at the ceiling. That, and it is worn so that Uffi can cover it over me before I recognize reality.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201cBut if Master Anis wants you to see it that way\u2026 you don\u2019t mind, do you?What do you care, Master Uphilia?It\u2019s going to be a tribute, and they hold my wrist where I tried to get up and push me into bed. Hey, wait a minute! It\u2019s suppressed!?\u201cHey, wait a minute! Wait, Uffi!\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNot a romantic emotion myself, I told you!?\u201d\u201cHa. I did say I didn\u2019t know. Is it something that imitates others and makes them fall in love in the first place?\u201cNo, not for reference!?\u201dBut I\u2019ve never heard of women\u2019s romance stories.\u201cHeh, you say reason, that\u2019s what you say!\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?For a moment, I was lost in my response to that question. Don\u2019t you like it, don\u2019t you?Uffi faces her lips, who asked for air to gasp without words. Ufi blocks me and dims my vision. The look on Yufi\u2019s face, which he sees with backlight, is kind of vain and colorful and his heart bounces as loud as it sounds.\u201c\u2026 or are you scared?There is a worrying color on Yufi\u2019s face that is so close to touching her now.Scared? Scared of what? I don\u2019t know. But it gets quieter as if it were cold that my heart was bouncing loudly. I close my eyes and breathe.\u201c\u2026 My queen told me. He wants me to take a good look at you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a master of lies. You don\u2019t have to be fake to be fake. Until you tell me, you may not be aware that you\u2019re hiding it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 your mother?\u201cDear Annis today, he said he seemed frightened by something. He said in his mouth that he clearly didn\u2019t have to be loved as a parent, that he seemed to want the affection of his parents. That didn\u2019t seem like what the kid thought it was, that it looked more real. It\u2019s like being in the shape of a parent or a child.\u201d\u2026\u2026Strength fell out of the body that was so tense in that allegation. Restricted to form, he said. He says he wants it for real. If they say that\u2026 just one thing, I know it.But is it a good thing to talk about it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve realized it since I was pointed out. Blur and what comes to mind distracts my mind. Oh, well. I couldn\u2019t stand it because I wouldn\u2019t be noticed the whole time, and I couldn\u2019t because I noticed it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWill you devote your life to me?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you lying?\u201cI swear.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 will you take my secret to the grave?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dWhat I didn\u2019t tell anyone. That I wasn\u2019t aware of. I forgot it with a sense of happiness to follow my dreams, mine.\u201cI, really\u2026 what can I say? Yes, you are. It must be a fake.\u201dIt was fake. So I had to be real. The words seemed to fit perfectly into my mind.\u201c\u2026\u201d Fake \u201d?I frowned at the words that Lady Annis told me.Anis, who visited the room when he was lying in bed without sleep, looked nervous and somewhere behaved suspiciously.I thought it was unstable, and that\u2019s what I felt when I saw it. So during the day, at the end of the meeting, I thought of what the queen had told me.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI want you to take a good look at her. That kid is faking something to us. While he doesn\u2019t think so either. I\u2019m a master of lies, and I don\u2019t make you think lies are lies. No, as much as she thinks she\u2019s true herself\u2026. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t say well either, but I felt that way. So look at her. You\u2019re probably the only one who can give her a vegetarian look. Uphilia \u2018To be honest, I leaned my neck against the queen\u2019s words. You think Master Anis is lying enough to falsify his feelings? Enough to fool yourself? I was wondering if such a lie seemed like an implication. What the hell is a lie so much that Master Anis would imply it to himself if it existed?Speaking of which, and. That\u2019s where I came up with it. It\u2019s about \u201cRaini\u2019s implication\u201d. Raini said he would be bounced because Master Anis would resist immediately. Though he himself said that the cause might be the effect of the curse caused by the engraving of the dragon\u2019s demonic stone.But what if that\u2019s not the only reason? If you\u2019ve already made your own \u201cimplication\u201d? When such an imagination passed, an unpleasant chill was what ran my spine.But, for example, I feel that Anis is calmly accepting to escape the harsh reality. I also want to think that I meant everything I thought about my family, and the words lie, falsehood really didn\u2019t tie me to Master Anis.But when I saw the anise visiting the room, I thought, Should that be called a mask rather than a lie or a lie? Have you noticed or not noticed yourself, too? It was like the mask was cracked and something was visible and hidden.So I tried. Master Anis seemed to care about being seen in love with me. But that doesn\u2019t match what you said or did when you protected me or when you declared you weren\u2019t getting engaged.If you like girls and like me too. I was wondering if that would be a pleasure. Is that confusion from joy, or is it another reason?And if I pushed Master Anis down, what I felt was\u2026 the color of fear. It\u2019s still odd discomfort, like he\u2019s just not aware of it either. The queen\u2019s words come back even if she doesn\u2019t like the discomfort that doesn\u2019t match her expression and reaction.And when I asked him repeatedly, Mr. Anise showed a reaction that would make that mask peel off. And there was an anise like I\u2019d never seen before.She says. He said he was a \u201cfake.\u201d He said he had something to keep secret. But I don\u2019t know what that is.\u201cUphilia\u2026 do you remember not herself?\u201c\u2026 a memory that\u2019s not me, is it?\u201cYeah. Not here. Somewhere, I don\u2019t remember myself living\u201d\u201c\u2026 no\u201d\u201cTo me, it was in my head when I felt like it. I remember that.\u201d\u2026 it is.What the hell is that all about?\u201cI have memories of previous life. I mean\u2026 I\u2019m not here, I\u2019m someone else who\u2019s going to live the life of a girl named Anisphere Wynn Palettia.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201cHaha, I have that\u2026. my magic is proof of that.\u201d\u201cMagic?I didn\u2019t think, \u201cLet\u2019s fly magically.\u201d I knew how to fly magically, so I was able to create magic. \u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. Then the order is certainly the opposite. It\u2019s a big difference that Anis was able to produce magic because he knew, not because he derived it.I didn\u2019t get a flash, I knew the way from the start. At that time, the magic of flying in the sky that no one could think of.\u201cI was a civilian.\u201d\u201c\u2026 civilians?\u201cYou didn\u2019t have an identity, to be exact. It was a world full of magic props that I invented in magic as a matter of course. Anyone can buy as long as they have the money. I lived in that world.\u201d\u201c\u2026 such a world\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only in my head, though. And this isn\u2019t about the world. It\u2019s conclusive evidence.\u201dYou put a foreground, and then Master Anis squeals like he spits out something seriously painful.\u201cThere\u2019s no magic. There\u2019s no magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no magic?\u201cTo be precise, it was a world without spirits. It was the existence of a gaga story. It wasn\u2019t real. Magic was just a dream story to make kids listen. At least that was the reality for me.\u201dLady Anis closed her eyes and continued her words with a slow exhalation.\u201cI still remember the moment I woke up. It was really a mundane moment. I woke up like what was falling apart in my head was fitted. From then on, I was\u201d Anisphere Win Palettia. \u201c\u201c\u2026 it\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not me. But I was\u201d Anisphere Win Palettia \u201d. I couldn\u2019t be any more, I couldn\u2019t go back, and I just had to live like that. I didn\u2019t hate that.\u201dLady Anise\u2019s breath trembled. My hands, which were loose, hide to cover my face.It\u2019s like putting your nails on a mask. It\u2019s going to crumble and break. Hold that, as if it\u2019s going to hide your face.\u201cBut I ruined Al\u2019s future because of me. endangered the future of this country.\u201d\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201cIf I was just\u201c Anisphere Win Palettia, \u201cif I wasn\u2019t even remembered in my previous life!\u2026 Oh yeah! Always, always, always, always! That scared me!!\u201dMaster Anis screams like he went mad. The mask breaks, the face becomes dewy. I was there\u2026 just like a child.\u201cI admired magic, but I couldn\u2019t use magic even though I was royal! It\u2019s in front of me, but I couldn\u2019t reach it! That\u2019s why I wanted a replacement! I wanted a compliment! I, I, I\u2019m not weird, I wish you hadn\u2019t thought of me weird! Just a kid who can do great things! Or you\u2019ll find out! I\u2019m not the Anisphere Win Palettia. I know who I am! Isn\u2019t that cruel!? Can you imagine Yufi? If you were told to live as someone different from tomorrow, I\u2019d have all my memories, but I think I am, but I have another me! What would your father think if your mother found out? Such a child, isn\u2019t it creepy?!?\u201dMaster Anis is screaming. Scream with blood spitting thoughts.\u201cI was loved. I knew it. As royalty, but they still loved me. I didn\u2019t want to betray you! If it just seemed weird to me, I just had to push through! All I had was the knowledge in my head, a weapon!\u2026 That\u2019s why I created magic. My, my own magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that was your secret.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware. I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t try\u2026. because if I look there, I won\u2019t be able to be those people\u2019s child. I\u2019ll take those people\u2019s children. I could have taken it all the way to the future of the country, but I could do such a cruel thing\u2026? So it was\u2026 easier to be a henchy princess. That was me. As weird as they say, I was stiffened by weird myself\u2026. Mother, that\u2019s amazing. I even realized I didn\u2019t notice. Really, I was blessed with a good mother, I\u2026\u201dAs I mourn from the bottom of my heart, even though I am happy. She squeals.Hard to imagine, her only pain was there. I looked at her bottom so painfully. I\u2019ve seen one scale that no one understands.Oh, this guy was so \u201cheterogeneous\u201d and so \u201cnormal\u201d.\u201c\u2026 yeah. Refreshing. Of the mind, it feels like some of the people I\u2019ve been to are back. This is my secret, Uffi. I really am, it wasn\u2019t Anisphere Wynn Palettia. It was someone. But at the same time, I\u2019m the Anisphere Win Palettia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be king, yeah. I had this underlying consciousness. I\u2019m a fake. Heterogeneous. So\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to make it any more messy. the world of the people who loved me. Besides,\u201d\u201c\u2026 and?\u201cThe magic, it was really nice. It was just what I admired. I liked this world. I thought I could love you\u2026. this is all I am for real. Whether magic is imitation or I\u2019m fake, the feeling of magic is real.\u201d\u2026 so she obsesses with magic. It produced a product called magic without giving up that magic could not be used.But too much for me. It\u2019s too \u2013 I\u2019m angry!\u201cI\u2019m an idiot\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou are! It\u2019s stupid! It\u2019s all, it\u2019s all set for real, isn\u2019t it? You are the Anisphere Win Palettia! The princess of my country who inherited your blood! I sent into this world a great alternative to magic, even without magic! Even if he was a stranger as a royal family, he still held his heart to thinking of someone! What do you say none of that is real!?\u201dShe thinks of herself as a fake somewhere in her heart and decides that there\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s real. She was too pathetic, stupid, miserable to look at.\u201cIt could have been someone else.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u2026?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Princess Anisphere who wasn\u2019t here, was it?\u201dI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s fake. You don\u2019t have to think that!There\u2019s this guy who thinks it\u2019s fake and moans compared to the \u201creal\u201d that doesn\u2019t even exist!\u201cYou are! You helped me! You\u2019re here! You\u2019re listening to me! You are the one who swore my allegiance!! There is no fake or real thing there! You are the only one!!\u201d\u2015\u2015 \u2015\u2015\u201cIsn\u2019t it all good for real? Besides you, I don\u2019t have you! So where do you say you are\u2026? It would be here!? All of it! What you felt would be here what I felt!?\u201dSlap her in the chest and exhale roughly. Only when there are tears in my cheeks and I wipe it away rampantly.\u201c\u2026 it must have been painful all along. I don\u2019t know the pain. I can\u2019t say I get it, etc. So let me tell you something, Master Anis.\u201dI finally found it, the way to take her hand, the answer to line up next to it.What this man wanted to be was not a king. \u201cA wizard who can make someone smile,\u201d but her dream.So let me do the magic, too. Give her the magic of salvation, too, as you did to me.\u201cYou\u2019re the best wizard in the world to me.\u201dBecause this guy keeps admiring magic so much.\u2013 My heart was breaking.No. It wasn\u2019t the heart that broke, it was the chain-like admonition that bound the heart.Yufi\u2019s words melted all over me. A commandment that was in my heart, that even I had turned away myself. Too tight, that shackle that was only with my heart. If you break the adhesion commandment, it hurts. It\u2019s decided to make me cry.\u201cHuh\u2026 Huh\u2026!My throat is cramped. My breath hurts. My vision is full of tears and I see nothing.Now I felt all was forgiven. I couldn\u2019t forgive you one day. It all got better now.Just free. I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t beat anything anymore. What I wanted is in my hand right now. I can definitely grab it.Hold Yuffi\u2019s body tight so he can hold on. I couldn\u2019t help it, I wanted to scream, but it was so painful that I couldn\u2019t breathe, I asked her to scratch the algae.I was in the mood to grab the straw. I never wanted to let go. Good thing this guy is the only one for me. I just wanted to hold my breath, it was painful, and yet I was happy, and I couldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201cYes, but\u2026!Thank you for saving me.Thanks for making me a \u201cwizard\u201d.Thanks for finding me that I almost forgot.I didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cking\u201d. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a wizard.Like giving an ash-covered princess a pumpkin carriage. I want to bring happiness to someone, a smile.It was a dream. It was a dream that I thought I could get but couldn\u2019t reach it. Because I was a bad wizard.Because it confuses the country and breaks someone\u2019s smile. But even for me, if you\u2019re in this hand. Because I can still say \u201creal\u201d.Oh, no. I can\u2019t breathe even though I want to thank you. It\u2019s painful, just painful.So I didn\u2019t know what blocked my breathing.Soft, warm. My heart remembers a normal heartbeat for a feeling that reminds me to breathe.Yufi\u2019s face spread all over his sight. I was crying at the end of my closed eyes, close enough that my forehead was going to stick\u2026!\u201c- Huh!? Mmmm\u2026!! Mmmm!Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!?Whoa, whoa, whoa!Near, no, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s blocked, away, powerful!? I can\u2019t peel it\u2026!Even though it\u2019s a breath I can\u2019t even remember, I leaked my remaining breath. Kurakuri, I thought my head had shaken, and my body lost its strength and sank into bed.\u2026 make sure I\u2019m grown up and Yuffi wakes up and leaves. I wiped those wet lips with my fingers and she made me laugh.-\u2026 oh, this, no. Totally fucked\u2026\u2026I was embarrassed and couldn\u2019t see her face properly. All I could do was groan while hiding my face with both arms.It\u2019s really been done. I\u2019ve made it unconscious, and I\u2019m going to be the real me. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been enchanted.I have fallen in love with this man, with Ufilia Magenta, helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38: 38\u201cDid you enjoy last night?\u201cChi, chi, no! Idiot!\u201dThe first thing in the morning is to say hello! You really made it, Ilia!After that, we fell asleep together in Yuffi\u2019s room. I couldn\u2019t help but cry and use my strength. Yes, I have no choice. There was nothing wrong with you!Yet I greet you this morning. I did, you don\u2019t look like that. Whoo! Mm-hmm. Tsk! These 10,000 years of beauty! Perfect squire!\u201cIs that a curse, Master Anis?\u201d\u201cIf you say something really bad, you\u2019ll be returned as many times as you want\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it Master Anisphere who doesn\u2019t care if you give it back\u201dDon\u2019t say anything stupid. Just eat your breakfast, and I\u2019ll handle the mess.I\u2019m used to it, so I start eating breakfast as prompted. There is no conversation while you are eating. Only the sound of the meal sounds as it is, almost at the same time finishing eating. I guess I\u2019m a little early, about.\u201cDear treat\u201d\u201cYes. What are your plans for today?\u201cReini again\u2026\u2026 no, I think I\u2019ll ask Ilia to use you. I need you to sign up for a meeting with the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cNow is it the Ministry of Magic? I heard from Raini, but with the King\u2019s life as his shield, he\u2019s going to insist on a dossier?\u201cHmm\u2026 before I do, I think we should discuss it properly.\u201dIlia looks unexpected in my words. Well, if you think of me before, right? I thought it would be useless to discuss it with the Ministry.I still honestly don\u2019t expect you to listen to me.\u201cI was wondering if I was any worse off getting out in a tough way than this one took the royal life. You can pull your father out again if he does something that buys you some time. You don\u2019t want to make things rough over there right now. Then I\u2019ll talk to the restructuring HR.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very calm opinion. That\u2019s all I had in mind for the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cHaha, I wasn\u2019t even me until yesterday\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming\u201dWould you look at Uffi there and not nod deeply? Ilia\u2026. I can\u2019t deny it if they say it\u2019s because of Yufi though.Ilia and Raini clean up after breakfast. All that\u2019s left is me and Uffi\u2026 actually, just a little awkward. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, but that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right with me?Look at Yufi, he\u2019s got a good eye. Then Yufi smiles softly, so he gets embarrassed and out of sight. Ugh, uhh, I\u2019m not feeling well\u2026!\u201cYou\u2019re so shy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just not used to it\u201d\u201cSo should you get used to it quickly? Or should I love the beginner anise?\u201cUffi is mean\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the influence of Anis.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s terrible\u2026\u201dLooks like it\u2019s my fault to go around\u2026. No, I wonder so. Uh-huh. I don\u2019t know.I can\u2019t turn my face to Uffi, even though it will if we just continue the conversation. Or me yesterday, I cried too much. I feel like I\u2019ve been showing all these weird faces. No, \u2019cause there\u2019s no way I can control myself that I\u2019m not aware of\u2026When I keep my mouth shut, I think of it stuffily. All I think about is Yufi\u2026. I admit it because I can\u2019t turn my eyes on you anymore. I like Yufi. Of course, in a romantic sense. I already told you to surrender completely.Just because I\u2019m aware of the problem doesn\u2019t seem to be the nature of being able to stand around cleverly. My mother told me that I was neglectful of people\u2019s feelings and my own, but I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know, so you don\u2019t have specifications\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why can\u2019t you afford Uffi?\u201d\u201cBecause I admire you\u201d\u201c\u2026 cheating\u201dI don\u2019t know how I could say that! I feel like if I stay like this, they\u2019ll make me good\u2026\u2026! If I don\u2019t get used to it sooner, they\u2019ll make me feel much embarrassed. I don\u2019t like that because I think I lost something. I still have older intentions.\u201c\u2026 so Dear Anis. Do you think your discussions with the Ministry of Magic will go well?\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dEven without emotion, yes. The studies of the Ministry of Magic do not go against my magic. Rebellion is inevitable if I try to push for magic. I mean, I can\u2019t know anything more than I am, unless the Ministry of Magic changes its current attitude and mindset.I can break it off if I don\u2019t have a choice now. My senses are, after all, uneven from the general feeling of this world. It takes time to penetrate it.\u201cYou can only admit it once you\u2019ve built it up one by one. No rush, huh? I\u2019ll work hard on the princess for a while. You told me your dream was coming true.\u201d\u201cBut you haven\u2019t, have you?\u201cOf course it is! But if we\u2019re going to move on, we have to consolidate the ground. I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to hang on here. It\u2019s not yet decided that Yuffi will be king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dYufi smiled gently and nodded at me. That\u2019s all I need, that\u2019s enough for me.I\u2019m not alone. I have someone to follow my dreams with. That fact is so comforting. So there\u2019s no rush. Even if you become king, you will not feel this feeling any more.Because you have Uffi there. So I can be so relieved, and I can believe tomorrow\u2026. while I\u2019m at it, I think it\u2019s cash.\u201cWell, we also have to be prepared for when we had to be kings. I\u2019m going to study hard today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be with you, Master Anis.\u201d\u2013 Well, then it\u2019s a few days from now.The day has passed since I informed Ilia of my request for materials. I haven\u2019t heard back from you yet, but it was about the time I started to wonder if this would be normal if my father and I would just have good footwork to do an immediate OK.\u201cDear Anisphere, we have a response from the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m here. I was wondering if I could decide on a day out or something right away.\u201dI take a letter from Ilia from the Ministry of Magic and look inside. The contents begin with an ordinary, aristocratic, rhetorical greeting. I didn\u2019t see anything I disliked, so I wanted to talk to you.Hmm, I think I\u2019m gonna go. Well, I guess you don\u2019t actually look good if you look at each other, but that\u2019s a stack you\u2019ve had, so you can\u2019t help it. However, this time I would like to tell you that I would like to cooperate.\u201cIlia. It\u2019s sunny, but I was wondering if you could tell her that this is the day because I think the Ministry of Magic can handle it at its leisure. If it\u2019s still sudden, could you tell her that it\u2019s okay to skip a few days at her leisure? I\u2019ll get back to you later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in awe\u201dIlia graciously receives it. I have to work hard too, I\u2019m not very good at writing letters\u2026\u2026 I was wondering if I could make a typewriter or something. Maybe I\u2019ll talk to Tomas next time I get down to Castle Town?\u201cThank you for your patience, Princess Anisphere\u201dOn the day of my visit to the Ministry of Magic, I was taking Uffi and Ilia to visit. Raini is leaving a message at the outhouse. Just in case, I asked the Commander of the Sprout Knights, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything like it before, but caution is important.I was greeted by a grandfather who was also seeing a back bend. Next to it stood that unfavourable Lang Voltaire and one less familiar young man. It was your grandfather who greeted me.\u201cNow the Ministry of Magic is in a tough time, too. Thank you for your time.\u201d\u201cPlease take your seats first. And Miss Uphilia.\u201d\u201cThanks\u201dI was prompted to take a seat, so I take a seat while you pull the chair. Everyone except Ilia sees the rash gathered again where they took their seats.Lang is a smile who still doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. I just feel like looking at me and Uffi somewhere with lizard-like eyes. Clearly, it\u2019s creepy. I don\u2019t want to get along no matter how much I try to get rid of the panic.In contrast, it is the other young man who has no idea. I don\u2019t really remember people\u2019s faces because I\u2019m basically pulling away from the palace. This one has a nice looking grin on people\u2019s faces, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way because of the prejudice in it?And the last old man. I honestly don\u2019t remember this guy much either. But it\u2019s like we\u2019ve met before\u2026 huh?\u201cPrincess Anisphere is above all in your breath disaster\u2026. I don\u2019t even seem to remember Non\u2019s face. No, time flies fast.\u201d\u201cWhen did you see me?\u201cShall I name you first? My name is Jiltu Graphite. He was the secretary of the Ministry of Magic for earlier generations. I was the head of the Graphite Marquis, but I\u2019ve already given it to my son.\u201d\u201cThe Graphite Marquis! \u2026 I do remember seeing you as a child.\u201dMaybe before I still tip into magic. Aren\u2019t you the grandfather who handled me when I got into the Ministry of Magic wanting to study magic? With that in mind, I\u2019m starting to feel like I remember somehow.The Graphite Marquis, in fact, don\u2019t ask so many names. That said, because I\u2019m not remarkably good. The Marquis family of fame, it was often said?Though it was thought that taking the seat of the magic minister of the previous generation would be an opportunity to spread the word, I knew that I had retired peacefully without leaving any activity that seemed to be active\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to remember. It\u2019s an old bone that just dries away, but if Princess Anisphere remembered it, it\u2019s above all.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026. But why the earlier generations of Jiltu Hou?\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to be put on a horse anymore. Please don\u2019t call me Jiltu. The King ordered me to represent him during the restructuring of the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cNow, Lord Ziltu, and. Is your father representing you?\u201cYeah, whatever. It\u2019s pretty important this time. The Chartreuse family, who was the next generation of the Kuniken cauldron, took it from you. I\u2019m surprised.\u201dThe Count Chartreuse family appeared, and the clan was executed for rebellion against the royal family for trying to establish a puppet regime by laying low and taking charge of Al-Kun only to talk about vampire relations. It has a lot of mouth sealing implications, but it was ideologically out, so there\u2019s no sympathy either.\u201cIt\u2019s where I\u2019m heartbroken, too. Without that one, my brother might have been able to worship the sunshine of becoming king.\u201d\u201cI heard you had pangs with Prince Algard?\u201cI certainly can\u2019t deny it. But I thought we could understand each other. In fact, we think we exchanged words with each other when we broke up. \u2026 really, unfortunately\u201dReally, yeah. Though my emotions disappeared unexpectedly and I became a whine in a low voice.I\u2019m scared to see the Ministry of Magic itself as an enemy when I remember Al-Kun too much. Slowly calm your breath and face back.\u201cI guess in my heart\u2026. Whatever, that\u2019s the circumstances under which the old bone was pulled out onto the surface stage. Now the competent Earl of Voltaire, the Son of the Son, has been very helpful. We\u2019ve managed to do it.\u201dLang gives a compliment\u2026. Well, you\u2019re an elite even if you rot.I guess I\u2019m just not fit for thought and I\u2019m competent. That he is the son of the Earl of Voltaire family, who is said to produce brilliant wizards from the boulder generation.\u201cLord Lang and I have met several times, but what about you?\u201cI\u2019ll catch your eye first, Your Highness. My name is Miguel Graphite. I was driven out with your grandfather\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cOh, Lord Jiltu\u2019s grandson.\u201d\u201cBecause it is so old bone. It\u2019s not that I belong to the Ministry of Magic, but I remember it quite well, so it depends on what I bring in.\u201d\u201cIt is\u201dLord Jiltu\u2019s grandson. Hey. Similar\u2026\u2026 similar? These people have a hard time grasping the vibe. Do you mean you can\u2019t see the bottom just because it\u2019s calm, or don\u2019t let it grab you? What a hard time. Looks like they\u2019re dealing with a cloud.\u201cNow it\u2019s time to get down to business. The Ministry of Magic is asking for materials.\u201d\u201cYes, I would like permission to view and retrieve materials stored in the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cWhat material exactly do you want?\u201con the history of the founding of the Kingdom of Palletia and then the Spirit covenant\u201d\u201cHo\u2026\u201dHearing what I asked for, Lord Jiltu narrows his eyes as he strokes his jaw.\u201cMay I ask your intentions?\u201cYou know I can\u2019t use magic innate.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s a nostalgic story. I remember handing Princess Anisphere some magic\u2026. It was an unfortunate story. Come on, I thought you were careless.\u201d\u201cBecause you can\u2019t just look down and move on. So now I\u2019m going to explore if I can\u2019t see the thread of the solution by examining the spiritual contract of magic origin. This is my father\u2019s mission as king.\u201d\u201cAs long as it takes! Surely, if the miracle of the first king dwells in Princess Anisphere, we can say that she is safe.\u201dLord Jiltu nodded at me with a laugh. Is this going to be better than I thought?\u201cBut what happens to magic if Princess Anisphere can handle magic?Yikes\u2026. I don\u2019t really want to be shaken right now. Miguel, who told the story, looks intrigued. I think Lang\u2019s eyes looked this way, too. You don\u2019t have to turn around.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 whatever it is at the moment. It would be reasonable to maintain the status quo for a while longer than your father had given you the privilege of clarifying your spiritual contract.\u201d\u201cSo in the future, you think it\u2019s possible to pull a hand from magic? That\u2019s unbearable!\u201cHey, Miguel. Your mouth is too much.\u201dLang looks grumpy when Miguel tells him to mourn. Um, shall I keep the face of the Ministry of Magic here?\u201cIt\u2019s something that was viewed more heretically than the original. Results are what you get. Guys, once again, we want to put our validation on the way magic works. A spiritual covenant will lead to the art of knowing the spiritual mind deeply. If so, I wonder if the existence of my magic will also be questioned as natural.\u201d\u201cAs long as it takes! Learn magic, hence magic! Please, Princess Anisphere, just pray for the light in her quest!Oh, oh\u2026Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Lang\u2019s eyebrows aren\u2019t going to come back. It is a little pathetic. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t want to get too excited, but hey.However, I could only have a loving laugh and this young man named Miguel planted a sense of bad taste in me. And Lang\u2019s displeasure wasn\u2019t going to go away! How did that happen!?\u201cDear Anis, may I wait outside?\u201cHuh? Yufi?\u201cThere will be many valuable materials, because they are going to be eye-catching. \u2026 please return when you have the necessary materials\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dAt the end of the conversation, which seemed to cause bad air earlier, Lord Zildou and I stood in front of a library closed with heavy doors and strict keys to receive the materials.When I tell her that I will wait outside, Anise will look at her like she missed the conjecture. I will be escorted straight into the library by Lord Zildu before exhaling. But if I don\u2019t tell you this, you\u2019re going to be distracted, Master Anis.\u2026 and some of you seem to need me.\u201cDear Uphilia,\u201d\u201cSon of Count Voltaire\u201d\u201cWith Lang. May I have a moment, please?\u201cYes, until Master Anis returns.\u201dThat\u2019s an indication. He called out to me, who was watching over Master Anis, but was also interested in me.\u201c\u2026 it seems like things are going on and it hurts my heart. Do you feel any inconvenience or anything?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. Recently, Anis has also changed his mind and served as a royalty.\u201d\u201cIs that a spiritual covenant as a first step?\u2026 What do you say? Do you stand a view that is involved in magic and works well from Master Uphilia, who is blessed with magical talent?To the kind of inquiry I would explore, I would stare at Lord Lang sideways and then take my gaze off. Then this sigh exhales into your shin and shakes your neck to the left and right.\u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t work.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why is that?\u201cI didn\u2019t verify it, but at the moment, Master Anis is innate in his inability to use magic. Will that be fulfilled even in spiritual covenants, or can covenants be made in the first place? As an assistant, I think we should look to the worst possibilities at the same time as we wish Annis success.\u201d\u201cAs good as it gets\u2026 I still wonder if that attitude is great as the one raised as the next queen. I\u2019m so sorry to hear about Algard\u2026\u201d\u2026 Yep, really. I just regretted it when I thought about it. Failure to save that one must be a disgrace to me all my life and an unconsciousness that I will continue to recall.\u201cEven though the Chartreuse family has gone wild, the trust of both of us has fallen\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Lady Anis does not think so. Instead, it was the discord that had accumulated for so long that was the seed of the problem, and he told me that now was the time to remove that bud.\u201d\u201cReally, that\u2019s delightful. If Master Anis could give magic to the Spirit, he would no longer be imprisoned by the incredible idea of magic. I wonder if that\u2019s the kind of sight you should still have as a royalty.\u201d\u2026 heh, really. \u201cThis is the world that Anis felt\u201d?I inadvertently deepen my grin at the emotions that have emerged from the bottom of my mind.\u201cIncredible thought, is it\u201d\u201cYep. That\u2019s what I think. There is no denying the use of magic, per se. But the theory that speaks of it\u2026 I thought it was just a little bit of a rush.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the theory of the occurrence of demonic stones from the occurrence of spiritual stones?\u201cYep. Referring to Spirit Stone, the gift of the Spirit, as the carcass of the Spirit\u2026\u2026 I thought it was very blasphemous. Not to mention that the Demon Stone is what the Spirit has degenerated, etc.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t deny it until it\u2019s useful, do you?\u201cYep. Even acknowledging the usefulness of magic itself, I think many people find it difficult to accept the idea that leads them there. I was concerned about that. And the royal family.\u201d\u201cSure\u2026 I\u2019m out of line, too\u201d\u201cLord Uphilia, too! No, I\u2019ve been worried about you, too. I was wondering if Princess Anisphere might be distraught\u2026\u201d\u2026 Yeah, he said he was sick. Because I\u2019ve always been heartbroken about it.\u201cNow, I\u2019m here. Be sure to show Princess Anisphere the right way. My loyalty to the royal family and to my country remains unchanged.\u201d\u201cOoh\u2026\u2026! That\u2019s comforting. Please, then, as a member of the Ministry of Magic, this Lang will also help.\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks\u201dTake my hand and stare at Lang mouthing on the back of his hand, and I smile back.Plus, Lang and Smile were where they were returning, but the voice that broke in there sounded.\u201cLang, why don\u2019t you come inside and help me out? Just Grandpa, you\u2019re gonna have a hard time taking out the materials, aren\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 Miguel\u201d\u201cLook, I\u2019m only helping. Wouldn\u2019t it taste good to go inside?\u201d\u201cHmm! I know! Let\u2019s just say son of the Marquis family, letting outsiders in is a bad outing! You\u2019re still forgiven for being such a Zildou, don\u2019t bother to look too big.\u201d\u201cI know. Look, he said come on.\u201dWhile I\u2019m just a little surprised by the attitude I don\u2019t think of as a very Marquis son, I see Lang enter the library with an abominable distortion of his face.I clean my hands by dropping Lang off in the back and then calling on the Spirit of Water to float the water polo in the universe.\u201c\u2026 unexpectedly Eggy, Master Uphilia\u201d\u201cWhat is it about? Just, yeah. I thought it was a little dirty.\u201dWipe your hands in the water polo, then squeal your fingers and mist the water polo to turn it off.\u2026 All this, I resent you. Dear Algard, I frown at the discomfort that makes the back of my stomach heavier.\u201cOh, I\u2019m scared! Or would you rather thank me? I stopped oiling the fire.\u201d\u201cWhat is it about? I thought I heard something very informative.\u201d\u201cYou really look just like your father. Ha ha, keep the parents and children together!You don\u2019t feel bad to be told you look like your father. The road is different, people, it\u2019s a respected back. You want to start lining up your shoulders someday.Well. I\u2019m observing a man named Miguel who broke into the story again. Somewhere without a grasp, you get the impression of a cloud. If you can never be alert, you\u2019re the one who sounds the alarm behind my brain.\u201cIs that me, on guard?\u201cI don\u2019t see a position, in the sense that\u201d\u201cNeutrality. Neither. I\u2019m just here to identify you. He\u2019s gray. It\u2019s not white, it\u2019s not black, it\u2019s gonna be both.\u201dHe said he\u2019s not an enemy or an ally, he\u2019ll be an enemy or an ally.\u2026 Is this the Graphite family policy? What is inconspicuous is that you refrain from being conspicuous? Close your eyes and look at Miguel.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your father and father are not your enemies.\u201dYou didn\u2019t even say \u201cyou\u2019re on our side,\u201d did you?\u201c\u2026 Nice. Yeah, well, people who can interact like this are really great.\u201dKeep staring at Miguel with your arms together and nodding away from your gaze.\u201cIf I were to reduce it, I wonder if I\u2019d find out if I could use magic anytime.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh!\u201cAre you unconscious? Is Prince Algard\u2019s divorce still ringing? It\u2019s tough not to realize if you don\u2019t point it out, you should fix it, huh?Sure, I was expensive enough to shoot magic anytime. Being pointed out made me aware, so it is easy to calm down. However, the problem is that I was taken into account, and the bitterness spreads.At the same time, my vigilance for Miguel and at the same time my interest boiled. Perhaps he is also quite a magical hand-worker. Didn\u2019t I ever hear your name because you\u2019re lying down\u2026?\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll continue to have a good relationship? Dear Uphilia,\u201d\u201cYeah, this way. Lord Miguel.\u201dThat\u2019s how I got my hands on Miguel. He looked just a little unexpected, Miguel, but he immediately responded to my handshake. A handshake to the point of contact is immediately released and a handkerchief is offered.\u201cIt was wet, so use it if you like\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern. Can I wash it and give it back?\u201cNow, please keep it until the next opportunity. We are always looking forward to returning it.\u201dYeah, when there\u2019s next time, sure. That\u2019s how we smiled at each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39: 39Well, I was able to borrow materials from the Ministry of Magic.Speaking of which, I thought you were looking into vampires. I didn\u2019t really care then, but now I\u2019m starting to think that fact is hateful. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I lifted my eyes from the file and looked up at the ceiling.\u201cToo abstract!\u201cYes?\u201dYufi, who was similarly loading the material, zeroes the voice of doubt. Is this the basis of this country? No, I wonder if that\u2019s what it is. Is that what this is all about? Is that what you want!? It\u2019s not good, is it?!?\u201cWe want to look into history.\u201d\u201cRight. So I asked for the materials.\u201d\u201cFor the record, you\u2019re not reading a story! That\u2019s funny though! The facts!? This says the accuracy of the facts properly!? I know where to glorify the great king! That! Actually! Of greatness! Details! Why not write it down!!\u201dI scratched my head and screamed. What I asked for was \u201cfacts that were in the past,\u201d not that I wanted to decipher what reality to read from an old inheritance! It\u2019s stressful!\u201cAnd the spiritual covenant! I say you have the power to be great or scared, but what kind of spiritual contractor do you actually have! In what contractual way! Like the details of what you need! That kind of information! I want to know!\u201c\u2026 didn\u2019t you write it?\u201cYou say that\u2019s too abstract! This may be normal for Uffi, but this doesn\u2019t tell you the\u201c facts \u201dof the past! This interpretation gives you your own answers!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, I see. That\u2019s certainly a problem. If you know it as a legend or a story, you can think of details, but when you verify it, you can\u2019t compare it.\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, Yufi!When you give an example, you have a destination and you want to find out the way. To read this information from the material stored in the Kingdom of Palletia: \u201cThere was once a man on his way there. The man\u2026\u201d said the man\u2019s references pinched, with descriptions of the feat that I don\u2019t know the details of unless I read another literature, and the information on the road at the heart is like being bracketed in \u201cAnd He\u2019s Got It\u201d.The hassle of having to put up another equation to give the answer to the equation. Furthermore, we need to examine the rhetoric and heritage of the past to decipher it and tilt our necks several times. Beyond the limits of my patience to boulders.\u201cWhen I was a vampire material, I was willing to assemble my own theory, and it was still better because it was an individual record\u2026 this is the material I keep as a country\u2026?\u201c\u2026 is it unsavory?\u201cFor example, you have the plumbing I suggested and your father executed, right? The condition of the land, the conditions and procedures of the time, even if construction is to be carried out. Suppose you didn\u2019t detail this, did you? What if the people weren\u2019t there when we were working on the new place? Who\u2019s going to verify this? If you don\u2019t have a detailed record, and they just hand you stories that glorify greatness,\u201d\u201c\u2026 can we just imagine doing the construction?\u201d\u201cOr while re-validating it. You\u2019re wasting your time! Why are they all abstract? This is why theology doesn\u2019t fit with me!!\u201dTheology in the Kingdom of Palettia is close to moral teaching that glorifies the Spirit, God, and the Great.We are the ones who have ancestors and honorable beings. Therefore, we thank the world every day and live to do our duty. Thank you, God, Spirit, ancestors! I will inherit that pride and live clean and right!This is more or less the place. This is good in itself. I don\u2019t mind taking care of what I inherit from the past and glorifying nature much. I think it is a faith or an idea that would take root with nature in the Kingdom of Palletia, rich in resources from the Spirit.The problem is that spirits and gods are too omnipotent to ask God for anything, a spiritual request. This is not good. The greatness of God and the Spirit was well understood. Great men at a glance from their gods and spirits are also amazing. Let\u2019s teach you a lesson! Because I still know.But when it comes to writing facts, it\u2019s so abstract that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. In other words, if you\u2019re going to criticize me privately, it\u2019s the product of suspension.\u201cNo, my head hurts when I\u2019m reading\u2026 I\u2019m not feeling well\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know Ennis was going to get that far\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 originally, I\u2019ve been faint in faith since my last life. There was a national pattern.\u201d\u201cWas it a world without spirits? If so, so is God?\u201cI was there, they say, but in reality, it\u2019s a product of fantasy. I didn\u2019t mean to have any faith, but I didn\u2019t mean to be saved by prayer.\u201dSaved, I can think. But I can\u2019t prove that you actually saved me.But this world will be demonstrated. Because there are spirits and gods. So I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to praise you. But I don\u2019t. Even if I can\u2019t benefit myself, the way I think about it is understandable. I can\u2019t empathize with you.\u201cYou\u2019re a lot different from this world.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Even if there\u2019s no magic, there\u2019s technology that\u2019s advanced more than this world. You know, a mass of iron big enough to carry hundreds of people at a time like my flying magic equipment.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t imagine\u201d\u201cNot only in the sky, but also in traffic. The streets were more organized, and vehicles that ran faster than horses were generally popular without having to use them.\u201d\u201cSo you think the material was more anise-sama\u2019s preference, too?\u201cI guess I should say it was a preference or a proper classification. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this material. It\u2019s just that if it\u2019s not clear what it\u2019s for, they\u2019re gonna step on two legs, or disappoint me.\u201dI\u2019m just disappointed I was hoping. And honestly, I don\u2019t think I can count on any other material. Where did you get your hands on it when you didn\u2019t have any materials to look into? I don\u2019t like it, but I wonder if I\u2019m going to have to make assumptions from inheritance and legend and test them to lice.\u2026 Wow, my stomach is going to be heavy. At this rate, it has seemed impossible to me to have a spiritual covenant for the rest of my life.\u201cYou don\u2019t care about Yuffi, do you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. Is it because you can still use magic? I think you have a different perspective. I can bury it as long as I can imagine.\u201d\u201cAh, well. Because I can\u2019t use magic, I can\u2019t accept it to my senses.\u201dWhat I want is facts and accuracy. All that is left in the dossier is emotional and sensory.I ask for facts and accuracy because I can\u2019t solve them in a sensory or emotional way. But Yufi isn\u2019t. I can sensibly inflate my imagination from the material I read. That\u2019s because she has affinity with numerous spirits and has a variety of senses and talents when it comes to magic.\u201c\u2026\u2026 hmm. I knew it wasn\u2019t the wrong policy, was it? It\u2019s just not for people like me.\u201d\u201cYou know what Anis says. \u2026 Shall I strike my hand in our behalf?\u201d\u201cUh, right. Shall we also consider such a policy\u2026\u201dIf you want to capture the facts, multifaceted, it\u2019s better to have a lot of references. I\u2019m sure that will happen from now on. No, I hope so.That\u2019s where I thought it sounded like a knock. With permission, it was Raini who came inside. Tea and sweets are on the hand.\u201cGood day, Dear Anis, Dear Uphilia. How about a break?\u201cYeah. Thanks, I was just stuck.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have it.\u201dI move the materials from the table I was facing to the table for tea and enjoy the tea and treats Raini brought me. It relieves me, even though it reinforces the fatigue that I was feeling as if it were staining my tired brain.\u201cRaini\u2019s much better at brewing, too.\u201d\u201cThank you! Not yet for Ilia\u2026\u201d\u201cHe said there were no specifications compared to veterans. And Ilaria?\u201d\u201cOh, I got blood earlier, so I\u2019m having a good night.\u201dTell Raini as he fingers his dog teeth. Speaking of which, you weren\u2019t paying attention to Raini because of your daily busy schedule. Are there any negative effects of vampirization?\u201cHow have you been? No negative effects or anything?\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 you look delicious when you run out of blood, people. Are you hungry or what your body wants\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was worse than I thought\u201d\u201cBut because Ilia will notice more than I think I am unwell myself\u201dI really can\u2019t get my head up, and Raini laughs bitterly. Ilia, you really adore Raini. That reassures me. I am glad that I have been able to connect with people as I have never seen anything but enthusiastic dating me.\u201cI\u2019m getting really good at it. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\u201cRaini\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, Master Anis and Mr. Uffi are happy.\u201d\u201cBuh.\u201dI hope you don\u2019t say that with such an innocent smile! You wouldn\u2019t know how to react!?\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, wouldn\u2019t you mind if we went down to Castle Town by ourselves with patience?\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve exhaled lately.\u201d\u201cCastle town. I wonder if it\u2019s a good distraction.\u201dIf you were going to Castle Town, I would have liked to see Tomas. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to decrypt material that I personally don\u2019t want to make progress with right now. Maybe I\u2019ll go for a distraction.Speaking of which, I haven\u2019t even shown my face to the Adventurer Guild lately. I guess I\u2019ll also tell him that in the future it will be difficult for me to participate even if there is an emergency.\u201cWhat will you do? Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm. Shall we go down? I have a little business to attend to.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you a message\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re going to be alone with Ilia, right?\u201c? Well, Master Ilia is on vacation, so you will. I always get blood, and I\u2019d like to take care of you once in a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry, nothing\u201dRaini, I wonder if it might actually be natural. Or is my heart just dirty? \u2018Cause we\u2019re friends getting blood, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the one pushing something evil. No, I feel like my relationship with Uffi has changed lately.When I looked up, Yufi was laughing elegantly with her hands on her mouth with a strange face. I sank\u2026\u2026. gif.\u201cLong time no see, Tomas\u201d\u201c\u2026 hasn\u2019t it been that long?Me and Yufi were visiting the Gana Workshop dressed for your patience. Tomas welcomed me on the same Buddha summit.\u201cThis, this previous apology item. Thank you.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026 You look good too, Master Yufi.\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks for that verse. I was able to listen to you and I was stomped off. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 come on. I didn\u2019t say anything big.\u201dsays Tomas as he scratches his head with a shin. I wonder if it\u2019s lit, maybe a little unusual.Well, I gave Tomas something to apologize for. Hey, Tomas had a favor to do, didn\u2019t he?\u201cTomas, I need a favor.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cOne, will you strike the sword?\u201c\u2026 what?Tomas looked surprised. Yufi has her eyes round too, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while.\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not an invention of magic. Not that order.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201cFor my sake, I want you to strike a sword that can withstand all my might.\u201dI take Mana Blade out of my nostalgia and show him. Long after it was done, it was no exaggeration to say my partner. But this is not enough.\u201cAl broke this, didn\u2019t he? And after using all my strength once, I\u2019m going to need maintenance. When it comes to withstanding this, Arcane Shell is the closest thing to ideal.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so to me?\u201cIt is good to use all the knowledge and technology I have ever given to the Gana workshop. I\u2019ll give you as much money as I can. I\u2019d like to ask for the best gesture for me\u2026. will you take it on? Tomas Gana.\u201dRequest not for co-development, but in anticipation of the arm of one blacksmith named Tomas.I fought al-kun and thought. It\u2019s not enough as it is now. But my technology isn\u2019t the only way to get there. I know Mana Blade is a masterpiece, but she\u2019s not my ideal one.Yuffi\u2019s Arcane Shell took my blow from the front and showed it. Based on that, if Tomas had prepared the best wave for me.\u201c\u2026 suddenly what happened? You didn\u2019t usually line up your mess and try to hold the sword itself.\u201d\u201cBecause I was in custody. But some ideals don\u2019t just reach detention. I want power now. I really need a sword to do that\u2026. because some people wanted to protect me.\u201dFor me, Mana Blade was in the \u201cmagic\u201d category. Magic itself reproduced with magic props. Not having a sword was a bit of a restraint. Because if I had the sword itself, something was going to brake in me.But I\u2019ve already found that to be a concern. Because I was already a \u201cwizard\u201d. So now I want power. Because I really need a weapon to fill in the missing power.\u201c\u2026 ok. That order, take it.\u201dTomas squeezed his face tight and nodded at me with a serious look. There is trust in that snort. I was able to smile naturally.\u201cInstead, I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d\u201cHmm? You got Mana Blade?\u201cAh. Do you mind?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good.\u201dI don\u2019t have a problem giving it to you if it\u2019s about one bottle. Because if it was Tomas, I would be relieved to leave it to you.Look at the Mana Blade you took from me. Tomas has a strong grip with a look on his face that looks like he can bite something off.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s heavy\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201cOh, uninterrupted\u2026 that\u2019s heavy\u201d\u2026 That\u2019s what I said and laughed at Tomas\u2019 face, and he accidentally caught my eye.You look good. No body. No, I wonder if it was me who was making you feel unwell.I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201cOoh.\u201dI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. We laughed at each other naturally out of such trust.I knew this sense of distance was our distance. It seemed so strong.\u201cHow did Master Anis meet Tomas?\u201cWith Tomas?Uffi spoke to me where I was headed to my next destination after Gana Workshop. What I heard was about meeting Tomas.\u201cWhen I was going to make Mana Blade, all I wanted was a sword pattern. The first workshop I went into was the Gana workshop, and that\u2019s when I met Tomas. It\u2019s a weird order, so you\u2019re making fun of me? That pissed me off.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what it feels like\u201d\u201cTomas has good arms, but you\u2019re right, he\u2019s heartless. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a good idea. But Tomas is top notch. At least he\u2019s the blacksmith I trust the most. I wonder if it has anything to do with it now while I\u2019m putting my order on. They were similar.\u201d\u201cSimilar things to each other, are they?\u201cI\u2019m looking for an ideal. I just have a place I want to get to, and I\u2019m not deciding what to do there. So there\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t talk about if we don\u2019t get there first\u2026 and we live in pursuit of it. I do magic, Tomas does blacksmith.\u201dThat\u2019s why I settled into nature\u2019s present relationship. I\u2019ve never heard of Tomas in detail. However, the fact that I inherited the workshop from my parents and the fact that I continue to protect the name of the workshop. I am not thinking about moving to a large workshop even if I am expected to have arms because I am not interested in selling.\u201cSomething\u2019s got the right wavelength, right? That\u2019s why I believe in Tomas without reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re a little jealous. And that kind of relationship.\u201d\u201cUffi can do it someday, too\u2026. and now you have me?\u201c\u2026 hehe, right\u201dYuffi smiles as the flowers break. That\u2019s all a little embarrassing is that it\u2019s worth the patience. Even I don\u2019t have a lot of people\u2019s edges, but that\u2019s why the bond I\u2019m connected to now matters, and it\u2019s loving.That\u2019s why I wanted power. It\u2019s also regrettable that al-kun broke me and cornered me\u2026 actually. My magic hasn\u2019t reached the wizard who drilled his powers yet. Oh, I still regret that. So I want to go further, I want to go further.\u201c\u2026 That said, it\u2019s time to consolidate the ground. It\u2019s boring.\u201dTruly, the right to inherit the throne is only a burden to me. It slows me down.As a result, there are places where you have to show your face. I reached my destination while walking alongside Uffi.\u201cDear Anis, are you here?\u201cYeah. This is the guild of the adventurers. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a face in person\u2026\u201dThe Castle Town Adventurer\u2019s Guild also houses a liquor store and a lodging house, so you can still hear cheerful voices even when the sun is high. Adventurers have their lives at stake, and it\u2019s not easy to live every day.I think they\u2019re free for that. Sometimes I envy it when I think that\u2019s why such a fun voice sounds.\u201cAll right, I\u2019m coming. Yufi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s ask!\u201c\u2026 what, is that the greeting?!?\u201dIt\u2019s Nori, Nori! Push open the swing door with momentum and I step in. The people who were inside my voice turn their gaze to me.\u201cGee!? Marauder Princess of Hunting?!?\u201d\u201cAhem!? I wonder who called me Marauder!? I\u2019m telling you at least make me mad!?\u201d\u201cSo what about that\u2026?Yufi is dropping his shoulder like he\u2019s tired of my scratch. No, it\u2019s something I can\u2019t give away privately, there!\u201cWhoa, Princess! You haven\u2019t seen your face lately, have you? Who\u2019s the lady next door?\u201cUffi, he\u2019s my assistant.\u201d\u201cAre you serious the next king is a princess? The world is over! Hire me a knight, too!\u201cTake your entrance exam!\u201cWhat are we going hunting next? Are you gonna wake up again, Stampede?\u201cI\u2019m not gonna wake up! Because if there\u2019s a stampede, I\u2019m not the one out there!\u201c\u201d \u201cAgain!\u201cOkay, a fight? Maybe a fight!? Long time no see, this Nori too!Even though I know I\u2019m royal here, it\u2019s easier for me because fewer people are afraid. Well, I guess it\u2019s also because of my immersion here.Yuffi seems to be eating, but this is the kind of nori that\u2019s good here. I guess you don\u2019t really want to fight over there either. You\u2019ll be royally treated by boulders there.\u201cAh, Master Anis! Oh, it\u2019s been a while!\u201cFarna, long time no see\u201dHiko, and. It was a long woman who put her face out of the carefree brothers and uncles of the adventurers. Farna is a receptionist for this guild who is taller than Yufi, but has the impression of being somewhere weak.People who often meet me face to face, too, and it\u2019s often from Farna to skip urgent contact with me. He\u2019s a weak, tall, but unusual person like a small animal, but he\u2019s also a little haggard with just the strength to give up adventurers with lots of rough people.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, come on, can I get you anything today?\u201cUh, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201d\u201cI\u2019m retiring.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hey, retired?\u201cYeah.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t think I can afford to be an adventurer anymore. If you don\u2019t tell them officially, they\u2019ll have trouble making me an athlete in an emergency. I\u2019ll miss you, but I can\u2019t help it.Farna opened her eyes and revealed her surprise to the great audience, which was solidifying to chew the meaning of the words cut out of me.\u201cOh yeah!? Ho, are you really retiring the adventurer?!?\u201d\u201cOh, hey! That marauder is retiring!?\u201d\u201cSeriously, that princess who shows up with rare demons and stampedes!?\u201d\u201cUh, shut up, shut up!It\u2019s loud and loud, already! Well, that\u2019s all you spare me, though I\u2019m a little happy to think.Removing it from the nostalgia is a tag indicating the belongings of the adventurer. When I am halfway through my breath, I gently hand over what is being given to the Adventurer to prove my identity to Farna.\u201c\u2026 ho, you\u2019re really retiring\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think I was making it athe as a force of war, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna get harder.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, no. Well, that\u2019s right, because this is what nature should look like. You\u2019re going to be the next king, Dear Anis\u2026\u201d\u201cI think drinking here will be a lot less. Or maybe it\u2019s gone?\u201cOh, that\u2019s lonely.\u201dEggs, sighs into Farna crying out. Damn, my tear glands are as brittle as ever. When Farna cried out, the adventurers around her also had a soggy air.\u201cThat marauder\u2026 retired.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s too soon. I can\u2019t help it because I\u2019m royal, but come on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just been weird. I always thought it was material, because I thought it was going to jump.\u201dI wish I could have lived like that, too, hey. Well, even if that comes true, it\u2019s a story ahead. Now that we\u2019re retiring, we\u2019re gonna get into trouble with each other.Still, what was spared was done here, and I was filled with a little pride, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: 40\u201cHave you become a distraction?\u201cYeah.\u201dOn my way home from the Adventurer Guild, me and Uffi were slowly walking side by side.From time to time, the children who rub off run through well. Pull over a little and drop that back off. Turning forward, Uffi, who was one step ahead, looked back and looked at me.Then Yufi gave me her hand, laughing. For a moment, Yufi\u2019s hand reached out and took my hand where I was about to tilt my neck. They hold hands as they are and look a little resentfully at Uffi lining up next door.\u201c\u2026 already\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?I don\u2019t know.Keep your hands open and the two of you walk away. A slightly farther road, like a roundabout of the city.\u201c\u2026 not all of Castle Town can be turned around, even if it\u2019s a pity.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201cWe\u2019re not getting anywhere near boulders in insecurity\u2026. the bad guys are everywhere.\u201dThere is a shadow of crime in the gathering place. Even the peaceful castle towns are a stash for the rogues, depending on the location.When I\u2019m in the Adventurer Guild, I also come in with stories like that with nature. Once you heard about a group of criminals who had been wanted by the state, you reported them to your father and sent the Knights.Some people have resented me knowing I was a princess because of the country\u2019s fast movement. I tried to pay you back.\u201cThere\u2019s no difference between rich and poor. I don\u2019t think I want to do anything about it\u2026 but I hope I get a chance to get out of here.\u201d\u201cIs it hard to save?\u201cSome people deserve it and get poor. Some people look for a way out if there is a law. If I told you everything, you wouldn\u2019t be here. You can reduce it.\u201dI am not an all-powerful God. I am not complacent enough to think that I can be a king and save everything in the world even if I am a wizard.\u201cNot so many people can be happy. I can help you make everyone happy.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis is sweet.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I guess so\u201d\u201cYep. So it also looks dangerous. So I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 hello\u201dI said I\u2019d be in trouble if they told me straight! I turned away as I shook my hand back, which only made me a little stronger to grasp.When I get back, the material and fighting time start again. Because I feel a little depressed when I think about it. Let\u2019s just go home a little slow. Because I want to feel this calm time.Well, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve cultivated sharpness with patience. I decided to share the work with Uffi on my proposal for loading the material.What I did was to first itemize the information I asked for. Create a classification item to the extent that Ufi has no difficulty, and fill in the information of the relevant item when Ufi loads the material. I will organize the information by compiling which information I have obtained from the materials.Pick up items with many analogies to find out if there are any derivative examples there. Load, organize, summarize, and collect inference material from the collected information.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s going to be a long task.\u201d\u201cYeah, not at all.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is a spiritual contract\u2026 I want you to leave me some information\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s also one of the rituals\u2026 The most common analogue sentence is\u201d The Great King spoke with the Spirit and became his friend. This is the beginning of the Kingdom of Palettia \u201c\u2026. because this is all it is\u201d\u201cHow did you become my friend! Oh, no more! I\u2019m starting to feel fast listening directly to the Spirit Contractor. Stop, stop! Even if we have to sort out the materials someday, it\u2019s not now!When I or Uffi become king, the Ministry of Magic will take responsibility and push me to organize the database. Let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s definitely do that. I want you to deepen your understanding of the Spirit and God as much as you like. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.I vented my dissatisfaction and closed my eyes as I rested on my back. My eyes squeeze because I\u2019ve been fighting with the material all my life.\u201cI like reading, so it\u2019s not bitter\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hate it either\u2026 I should have. I\u2019m a little unsure right now\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 good job\u201dFearless theology. I\u2019m sure God doesn\u2019t like me. That\u2019s not even a spiritual contract, is it, haha!\u2026 Much.I could see Uffi doing an invitation when it was blurry as it was brought to the chair. He stroked his head as he stood and walked over thinking of something.\u201c\u2026 treating you like a child?\u201cNo. You\u2019re a good boy, good boy, good boy\u201d\u201cYou treat me like a child\u2026\u201dOh, but I feel good about Yufi\u2019s hand\u2026\u2026. I want to leave it like this no longer. I don\u2019t want to work hard. I want to study magic, I want to develop new technologies. I want to live freely without worrying about your service.Soon after I realized it, the couch had guided me into a knee-pillow position. Yufi, when are you gonna put me in the knee-pillow position\u2026\u2026 oh, I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m tired anymore. Watch the void as you indulge in the feel of Yufi\u2019s knees and palms.\u201cExcuse me. \u2026 you seem tired.\u201d\u201cYeah, could you make me some tea? Ilia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in awe, Master Uphilia\u201dIlia, who looked at my ugliness and looked at me like I had guessed a lot, smiled bitterly and started preparing tea for me\u2026. where Yufi is knee-pillowing me, I was seen as much as I wanted. But now I\u2019m too tired to work my head off anymore. You can sleep like this.\u201c\u2026 I appeal to my father about the importance of material organization, item classification and indexing\u2026\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dI want you to make an inventory. True. Or when I\u2019m king, I\u2019ll definitely let the Ministry do it. Absolutely\u2026!I\u2019m really starting to laugh at how incompatible it is with the Ministry of Magic. Is that a gateway or something to me? Oh, my head hurts\u2026\u2026 Yufi\u2019s hands feel good\u2026\u2026\u201cDear Anis, speaking of which, I have received your letter.\u201d\u201cLetters? From where?\u201cThey say it\u2019s from the Gana workshop. This is the workshop where Lady Anis was kind enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201cFrom Tomas? I don\u2019t know.\u201dGet out of the knee-pillow position and I get a letter from Raini saying I\u2019m from Tomas. It was a concise letter like his.After checking the contents, I gained momentum off the couch. Turn to Yuffi immediately.\u201cYufi! Let\u2019s go to Castle Town!\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYes, my sword!The depressing mood blew up all at once. I can\u2019t help but want to jump out now. Seeing how I nodded, Yufi smiles to see the troubled child before shifting her gaze to Ilia and Raini.Ilia snorted in sigh and Raini just laughed bitterly. What, the good news just popped in where I was distracted, so I\u2019m glad to hear it!With the momentum as it stood, I flew out to the castle town to pull Yuffi\u2019s hand.\u201cOh, Master Anis. Where are you going?\u201cHi Auntie! We\u2019re going to Tomas!\u201cOh, yeah. Be careful!I run through holding hands with Yufi as I get a voice from a different rubber.If I opened the familiar Gana Workshop door with momentum that just kicked open, it gave me a big sigh of sigh after Tomas, who was sitting at the counter, rounded his eyes.\u201c\u2026 open the door quietly\u201d\u201cSorry! I saw the letter!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the princess\u2019s role\u2026 you\u2019re the same, really\u201dLike a shudder, but laughing calmly, Tomas took his seat from the counter and came back with one sword in his hand. When I saw the sword tucked away in my sheath, I rounded my eyes.\u201c\u2026 this is it?\u201cOh. This is the best I can hit right now.\u201dReach out and lift your sword\u2026. short. Yes, my body is short. It was a dagger from anywhere. It\u2019s a little different from what I thought and confusing.I didn\u2019t expect a dagger to come out because I thought it was either Rapier like Yuffi\u2019s Arcane Shell or Longsword on its own.But for a dagger, the handheld pattern part is long. It seems disproportionate because the pattern is long against the body. And the part of the filament is also intricately crafted\u2026. craftsmanship?\u201c\u2026 what is this\u201d\u201cPull it out, see for yourself\u201dAs Tomas told me, I pulled my dagger out of my sheath.The blade of the dagger that showed itself before me is a single blade. The filling does convey the weight with meat thickness.Beautiful as polished was going to reflect my face.\u2026 and familiar with your hands often. Grip it again and you\u2019ll see. The length of this pattern can be shaken with one hand or with both hands. The only thing that is disproportionate is the length of your body.\u201cI broke down Mana Blade and she showed me how it works. Besides, I used Yufi-like\u2019s experience from Arcane Shell to work out a glass of spiritual stone that could only be stuffed into my body. Thanks to this, my body has thickened, but I won\u2019t break it because of the fact that it is half-lived. And that fullness acts as a conductor of magic. It\u2019s easier than ever to put magic on your body, and it\u2019s easier to form a body.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but isn\u2019t this a sword or something?\u201cThe sword.\u201d No, it\u2019s the Devil\u2019s Sword chick. That\u2019s all there is to make use of Mana Blade\u2019s functionality. It\u2019s not a serious sword. I wouldn\u2019t be dressed as a sword. I calculated the length of the body and the length of the pattern, but I can adjust it somewhat. Let me know what you think later. \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201d Can I expand \u201d?\u201cOh, let me see. I tried it too\u2026 while I\u2019m at it, it\u2019s quite a horse.\u201dNodding at Tomas\u2019 words, I take a distance from the two of them and hold the sword with both hands. Turn your consciousness to magic into your sword as you exhale slowly.\u2013 Deep. That\u2019s what I felt first. First of all, the magical streets to the full body are good. So deep. I can\u2019t see the limit value as far as wondering how much magic I can put into it. How much magic can you instill?Inject more magic than usual when using Mana Blade. I know Tomas says horse then. This uses more magic than Mana Blade, and I can eat it.When the magic instilled exceeds a certain sense, the magic body is formed by stretching out of the pattern. A single-edged fillet of light that finally matches the length of the fillet with the length of the pattern.\u201cIf used as is, the body can be used with an image that stretches the body\u2019s body. Change the way you inject magic if you want it to be double-edged. Toggle the amount of Spirit Stone injected into the core of your hand to aid in deformation.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s why I have three.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis has a lot of magic. I was wondering if I could modify that\u2026 dissatisfied?\u201cI wonder if we could lower the cost and limit values a bit more as a mass produced product. But as for my dish\u2026 it\u2019s the best demon sword I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dI can\u2019t break it first. Instead of my full strength, I feel the strength of stickiness and the depth of nostalgia that I can assure you that infusing dragon magic won\u2019t break.\u201cI guess it feels like it\u2019s for protection when it doesn\u2019t pass through magic. It is easy to pull out because it is short. Easy to build, better to protect than to attack.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s magic in the offensive hand, isn\u2019t there? Then I can protect you as much as a tool. That sword will never break. As long as you don\u2019t give up and keep gripping, it will help you. Instead of shielding even if the magic runs out, and I thought it would be convenient to play the attack\u2026. this is my masterpiece I\u2019m sending you\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is there magic?\u201d I heard terrible killing complaints, true. \u201cMy eyeballs got hot by accident. This is certainly a sword for me. Guardian\u2019s sword, which presupposes the use of the Devil\u2019s Sword. It was Mana Blade\u2019s weakness. It eliminated her endurance to physics, so she would use magic for that matter. Then a horse.A sword that is not produced if it is a normal idea. It\u2019s my only sword. It\u2019s for me. This sword cannot be broken. So I can keep using \u201cmagic\u201d. Unless this magic runs out, unless this will runs out. \u201cDemon Sword\u201d is also a \u201cmagic wand\u201d for me that does not presuppose demonic props.This is my \u201cDevil\u2019s Sword\u201d that pairs with Uphilia\u2019s Arcanshell.\u201c\u2026 Tomas. What\u2019s the name of this sword?\u201cHuh\u2026. I have no upbringing. If you like it, Lord Anis will give you a name.\u201dNo, that\u2019s troubling me. Name, name\u2026\u201cCelestial, how about that?\u201cUfi?\u201d\u201cI think it was a name that meant\u201d empty \u201d. \u2026 because my arcane shell is a\u201c rainbow \u201d\u201d\u201c\u201c Sky \u201dfor\u201d rainbow \u201d?\u2026 a sister sword would be perfect.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s the perfect sword name for anyone who wants to fly the sky for the first time in this world\u201d\u2026 Empty, huh? Yeah, that\u2019s where I always started.I looked up at the sky that day and I became \u201cI\u201d. It\u2019s all about me since that day. This life, prayers, wishes. It\u2019s mine alone, created by what I have done to this world.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dTears flowed naturally. I\u2019ve been crying a lot lately. But I didn\u2019t want to stop this tear. Because I thought this tear was more of an admiration than anything for Tomas\u2019 work.\u201cTomas Gana. It\u2019s so good to see you.\u201dI put my magic in it and put the sword I was given the name Celestial in my sheath before I offered Tomas my hand. Like asking for a handshake.Thomas shook my hand with a little confusion. Clumsy, clumsy man\u2019s hand. What this hand has produced is loving and proud of me.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the good fortune I had in meeting you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re royal or civilian. You are the best blacksmith I recognize. If it\u2019s true, I\u2019d like to give you the honor\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 no, good\u201dTomas smiles calmly at me like he\u2019s never seen before.\u201cHe showed me tears worth more than any gem\u2026. I\u2019m satisfied with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it was a little late to dictate.\u201d\u201cWho dictates\u201dYeah. We\u2019re good with that. So I want you to let me say it again and again in my heart, Tomas.You\u2019re my unchanged friend. He wants to say thank you again and again.\u201c- Tomas! Come on!Anger popped in as if to crack and break such air. It was an uncle of a familiar adventurer who came inside.\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s up?\u201cDo you have the sword I asked you to take care of?!? It\u2019s a case of\u2026?!? Wow, isn\u2019t it Master Anis?!? Why are you here?!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on business, too. What, a bad case?\u201d\u201cThe dove has arrived! The Devil Wolf is out! It\u2019s a defense fight because they\u2019re coming this way!\u201cWhat is a Demon Wolf\u2026 Fenrir!? That\u2019s unusual!? Or it\u2019s coming this way!?\u201dFenrill is a demon of the werewolf species and, at the same time, a tentative name until the \u201cnamed demon of the werewolf species\u201d is officially named. However, there are few things that can be officially named the demon of this hand.For some reason, its invasion speed is top notch among demons. By the time you name it, it\u2019s devastating, such a demon. That\u2019s why the \u201cnamed\u201d demon wolves before they were named are often called Fenrill and unified names.Conversely, the damage must be stopped before it becomes a \u201cname\u201d. That such a chemical class is headed for Wang Du!?\u201cI don\u2019t know if the area of occurrence was close or coincidental! Even pigeons say they\u2019re a step ahead of him! Stand out, wind! Or dirt! If it was a subspecies, I couldn\u2019t even hit my eyes!\u201cNow that we\u2019re fighting in defense, we\u2019re going to intercept you at the nose tip of the king\u2019s capital!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the only way\u2026\u2026! I don\u2019t know if the evacuation\u2019s gonna make it now, damn it!I listened to my adventurer uncle. I turn my gaze to Ufi. Yufi took my gaze and sighed like she\u2019d given up. Hehe, I\u2019m sorry. After all, it doesn\u2019t seem like a \u201cbig time\u201d to me!\u201cDo you know where it\u2019s coming from? Are you coming in a straight line?\u201cIt\u2019s almost a straight line! There is no village that was the Lord on the path\u2026 hey, Dear Anis. Are you kidding me?!\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m sorry I said I\u2019m retired? Still, I\u2019m a\u201d princess \u201cand a\u201d wizard \u201c! Tell the Adventurer Guild! I\u2019ll be ready for the defense, but Anis is going to strike out!\u201c\u2026 what the hell, Conch Show! You\u2019re just gonna take it to the delicious place again! I\u2019m sure your magic props will make it quick to pick up enemies!\u201cThen beat me to the guild as an urgent request! Continue to me, say!! Cheers for my luxury if you hunt safely!\u201cI\u2019m on, dammit! The Wolf has no luck either! I\u2019ll let the invasion path out! Hurry up and get that demon prop! If we\u2019re late, we\u2019ll take it all! Tomas! Sword it out!\u201cAye.\u201dMy uncle rushes out with the sword that Tomas brings in his hand. After I see it through, I turn back to Uffi too.\u201cYufi! We\u2019re coming too!\u201cYes.\u201dWe have to go to the Imperial Castle first! It\u2019s been a long time since Airdra made it!The road that leads to the Kingdom of Palletia. Happy or unhappy. There was nothing like a 'sole\u201d going through the wind cleaving distractions.\u201cSole\u201d was hungry. I couldn\u2019t help but feel my stomach and my food for my existence was dwindling. The allowance or gradual prey filled the belly, but the hunger did not know where to stay.And I found it. It was fine meat. The meat is scattered and cannot be said to be much meat itself. But they flock on top of being easy to hunt. Some of them emit fine smells.The sense of smell that captures its prey is far from 'sole,\u201d but prey is prey. Until you find it and eat it. And \u201cSole\u201d walked away. As if to cleave the wind, as if to kick the ground to pieces.The smell is coming up. Hunger becomes stronger. Yeah, fast and full, I ran through my instincts wanting to fill this being. It caught a strange smell and a strange noise in its ears.\u2015\u2015Stop your legs. It was like, that was some kind of hissing. I\u2019m on my way as cleaving the sky as I am. That too, yes.\u2013 From the 'sky\u201d. It makes you look like you\u2019re stuck in front of yourself. Two prey cross the odd things that slowed down as they slipped through the ground and wrapped around the wind.A prey that gives you a premium smell and a prey that seems likely to be edible but has a thin flavour. But \u201cSole\u201d never jumped to prey bravely. Because my instincts were ringing the alarm.\u2013 They say they\u2019re hunters, just like themselves.\u201cWow, you\u2019re pretty big\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to be able to hit the path safely. So, Master Anis?\u201cI know. Come on, Fenrill without a name.\u201dOne of the prey utters a voice that is incomprehensible. But I can understand it even if it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201cLet\u2019s define your end of the line.\u201d\u2013 The competition for survival begins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: 41The fur is dark black gray. Eyes are bright red eyes filled with starvation that shimmer. About three or four times the size of a person? Hey, it\u2019s big. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve fought Fenrill, but this one\u2019s pretty big. Is that the pattern of eating prey before the stampede happened?\u201cYufi, can you go? Do you want me to fit in?\u201cJust kidding. I\u2019ll fit in.\u201d\u201cThen your breath is perfect. Out front, behind you?\u201cI\u2019ve been entrusted. Please, just look ahead.\u201dShall we go then? Strike magic into the engraving on your back and set fire to the struggle. The magic that runs all over your body fades your fear. Yeah, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a fancy prey. Let\u2019s do it right.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019ve had a great opportunity, Celestial.\u201dLet\u2019s go. There\u2019s no turning back. Throw the word and step in with momentum. Fenrill also corresponds to my speed. He opens his mouth wide and comes toward me in an effort to keep my head in control.While I don\u2019t kill the momentum of my body, I swivel to gain momentum and slip through the side of Fenrill as I hit my teeth to shield Celestial. Magic pours into the Celestial at the same time Fenrill lands.\u201cMake it simple first! Slash it!!\u201dHe converts magic to form a body and stretches the blade as it is, trying to wipe out Fenrir\u2019s body. Fenrill responding to my movements also suddenly bounces sideways in response to the extended blade. It comes with an extra neck stray. I would have liked to have plundered even one of my fangs if I hadn\u2019t strayed.But fast. Just because you\u2019re going to deal with me is out of standard. Furthermore, the opponent is more gigantic and the speed is faster that way. If I get away with it, I can\u2019t deal with the boulder either. Fenrill wasn\u2019t as good as this one before, and I don\u2019t know because there was a siege net.\u201cYo, hey, ha!\u201cGrrrrrr!\u201d\u201cHands! Get down now!Now he dodges Fenrill as he steps finely toward tearing him apart with his nails, taking overhead, turning his body in the air and tapping him into the heel drop.Stiff though. The body moves quickly under a murderous gaze and lands momentum as it rolls its back on the shaft with its slapped legs intact.\u201cGah!!\u201d\u201cOoh!?\u201dAt the moment of landing, a growl shouted as he received a gaze as if to stare. That becomes the bullet of the wind and comes at me. Preventing Celestial from shielding it aggressively also blows your body behind the shock.Bounce and rebound without defying the momentum. Celestial is\u2026 intact! Sturdy! If that was Mana Blade, it would have been dangerous!\u201cBut a plain is hard to do\u2026\u2026!It\u2019s hard to be passive because Fenrill moves faster. I can react, but I\u2019m worried if you didn\u2019t come this way\u2026!\u201cDear Anis, get behind me! Run!That\u2019s where Uffi\u2019s voice reaches his ear. Fly backwards momentum before confirming, change your posture so you can jump and run backwards.\u201cEarthquake.\u201d Huh!Yufi grabbed the arcane shell with both hands, and it seemed horizontal to pierce it into the earth with momentum. In a moment, the earth blew up. No, the earth bulges out in disorder and the plains change their appearance.Even as the spear-like tip approached Fenrir from its raised earth, Fenrir could see that he was already about to start his walk towards Uffi. The earth protrudes to hold it down, and Fenrill\u2019s feet stop.\u201c\u201d Air Hammer \u201c!\u201dEvery earth that blocked the road, Uffi slams a hammer of wind on Fenrill. Although the blow involving the hammer was only losing momentum, it pours down to soil Fenrill.As Fenrir turned himself uncomfortably, Yuffi kicked the raised earth and climbed up and up. Swing through the arcane shell as it flips and shakes away in the universe.\u201c\u201d Water! \u201cUffi summons a large amount of water from the air to bathe Fenrill. The ground that has already collapsed is muddy. Fenrill opens his mouth wide and releases a bullet of wind to Uffi to release his breath.\u201cUffi!\u201dI wondered if I could move in the air, and I doubted my eyes where I was in a hurry to chase them.Uffi \u201cran through the sky.\u201d No, wind under his feet, scaffolding for just a moment and 'stepping on the sky.\u201d Uffi builds momentum where he avoids the bullets of the wind and heads to Fenrill as he speeds up his fall.\u201cWe have a frenzy feast here. Receive my voice, desolate!\u201c Icicle Storm! \u201cIt produces a whirlpool of cold air that envelops Fenrill as if the Spirit of Wind and Ice were ecstatic. The whirlpool of blown cold air freezes the moisture contained in Fenrill\u2019s body, the mud rolled up, and all of it to stick to his body.Fenrir walks away from the whirlpool of cold air as he growls, not to mention that this is unbearable. As if Uffi sews a way out of the crumbled earth.\u201cIf only I knew where I was going!!\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u201cOveredged!\u201c Dragon \u201c\u2026\u201d Crow \u201dHuh!!\u201dThere I go around. The shape of the blade is broken, and the demon blade, deformed into three nails, rips Fenrill\u2019s body apart. A blow of a dragon\u2019s claw is engraved on his body as he rips Fenrill\u2019s flank as he tries to avoid it.Blood dances. Fenrill screams tall at the wound torn apart like a rub. All right! The heavy one\u2019s in! Or Yufi is too unscrupulous! The terrain is changing!\u201cDear Anis! Coming!\u201dFenrill, burned in anger, stares at me. I thought I was coming straight at you, and I yelled at the sky. My surroundings darken as I growled so much that I shook my ears. The cause was the clouds\u2026. clouds?\u201cIf you do\u2026! Yufi! Back off!\u201c He\u2019s wet! \u201cIn response to that voice, we distance ourselves from Fenrill once. At the same time something pours out of the sky towards Fenrill\u2019s body. That\u2019s enough light to burn your eyes if you look straight at it, and the thunder that shivers your tympanic membrane, or thunder!I thought it was the wind, thunder, which is also a subspecies of the wind! If Thundercloud could be called so soon, it would also retain the Demon Stone of its attributes.Even though I got lightning, no, I\u2019d rather have called it in to store it in my body myself. Because of the charge, Fenrill takes a diseased stance while causing purple electricity to explode into the chin and air.And Fenrill\u2019s assault approaches me. Obviously the speed is increasing! What an inch to power up with thunder! Stopping the Celestial on the shield in an aggressive manner to receive the fangs.\u201cGuru\u2026 no\u2026! No, paralyzed\u2026\u2026!This guy is about to run an electric shock over here!? Feel the omen. I\u2019m about to be crushed by the giant that hits me. Oh, no. This guy\u2019s charging as much as he wants right now!\u201cNah\u2026 Nah!!\u201dTap the magic into the celestial with all your strength. With my will, the blade of Celestial grows and grows, lifting my body into space as it is. At the same time as I get that momentum, I take my hands off the Celestial.At the same time, Fenrill\u2019s giant falls in like it snaps my demon blade. The blade, which lost its source of magic called me, splashes like a glass cracks, and the celestial circles the universe. I reach for it and grab it.\u201cUfi! Fly me!\u201cAh,\u201c air hammer \u201c!\u201dI yell at Yufi for trying to get closer to me. Uffi struck me with a hammer of wind as he understood my intentions. I take it as a shield with a celestial and land right on the ground. Tsk, I couldn\u2019t kill the momentum. Slightly paralyzed feet! But it\u2019s better than paralyzing your whole body!\u201cYufi, I saw it!?\u201d\u201cYes! Wind, then thunder! I thought this Fenrill was a rare species!\u201cHow valuable do you think that demon stone is!?\u201d\u201cI knew it! Oh, no more! Someone who can\u2019t help it!\u201cI\u2019m sorry!I\u2019ll take this Fenrir demon stone! It\u2019s worth studying the Fenrill Demon Stone of the dual attributes of thunder and wind!\u201cYufi! I\u2019ll take care of the back because I want to decide all at once!! I\u2019ll use the\u201c heart \u201d!!\u201d\u201cI have deposited that life!Good reply! Come on\u2026\u2026 let\u2019s go, Celestial! Go farther, faster, farther!!\u201cWake up!\u201c Fantastic Dragon Demon Heart (Dragon Heart) \u201c!Replace all magic and dragon magic by slamming the curse. Inject the seemingly excessive power that runs all over your body into the Celestial.Moment after moment, Celestial takes his magical powers in seclusion. If you wonder what it is, Celestial\u2019s unfolding blade of the Devil\u2019s Sword hardens like a thin, blue crystal.\u201cWhat?\u201dI don\u2019t know.Or my body is light\u2026\u2026 wow, it\u2019s dangerous! Fenrir approached me so I waved the celestial as I paid for it.Then, what do you think? The crossed nails were mutilated from the ground up without resistance.\u201c\u2026 what?No, you\u2019re cutting too much. What is this, Tomas? Explain it to me!Or my body is light. It\u2019s usually so much the magic of a wild dragon rushing around in your body. For that matter, it thickens the blade of the blue crystal as if Celestial were self-asserting. You can even hear the noise\u2026 Yah, if you don\u2019t release this, it\u2019s gonna break!?\u201cThis, then, horse! Take magic. No!!\u201dStep on both feet and swing through them to shake up the blade in tandem with the full body force from foot to shoulder. The blade that was crystallizing responds to my will, dissolving itself from the crystal while also emitting a dazzling light, once again becoming a blade of magic to explore the world.Even the dark clouds that Fenrill was calling out can be dispelled, a blow that gave him a peek into the blue sky. Fenrill, whose body is amputated to launch, raises the severer.\u201c\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201dTomas, it\u2019s a dong pull. What is this, my demon sword, too awesome and scary?\u201cI mean, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201dSeeing Fenrir sink into the ground with a blunt sound, I accidentally screamed like that.Look at me like that, without even realizing how Uffi is sighing like a coward.\u201cTo Princess Anisphere!\u201cWe\u2019re in the Princess!\u201c\u201d \u201cCheers!!\u201d \u201cThe night the moon rises. In the king\u2019s capital of the kingdom of Palettia, in the square of its castle town, bonfires were set ablaze to light the darkness, and the noise of drinking and singing was spreading. The center is the adventurers, but the inhabitants of the town gather there all the time to say it\u2019s a festival.In the middle of that square rests Fenrir, whose body has been severed by shortness of breath. The black-grey body, which has completely shed blood and dirt, is exposed to the light of fire and its fur luster at all costs.The calamity that tried to reach the tip of the nose of the king\u2019s capital was prevented by the activity of Anisphere and Uphilia.By the time the Adventurers\u2019 advance team arrived at the two places, they had already settled, so the name \u201cMarauder Princess of Hunting\u201d became grass, saying it was not Dada.With the delivery of Fenrir, who was transported to Castle Town, the request from \u201cPrincess Anisphere\u201d was completed. As she declared, a feast for luxury was held.It was the people of the castle towns who had been informed by the Adventurers Guild of the possibility of evacuation that spread the enthusiasm of the people here. Fenrir\u2019s carcass was brought in with fear, but the threat also left, and the adventurers decided to jump in and join them.And while the feast was still happening, the leading actor, Anisphere, was looking up to heaven.\u201cOh, you guys, no!! You\u2019re not going to empty my savings!?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha! What are you talking about, Princess Anisphere! It\u2019s the princess who said it was a luxury!\u201cBe Gothic! No, it was hard to carry Fenrill!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve done! Or even the people of Castle Town!\u201cNo, we don\u2019t say we\u2019re extravagant, Princess Anisphere! Hey, adventurer there! There\u2019s fresh meat! Perfect for a feast! I\u2019ll keep it cheap now!\u201cLeave me alone with Princess Anisphere!\u201cEvery time!\u201cHere uhhh!!\u201dI can yell like an anisphere threatening me as I wave my hands up. But without even thinking about it, the adventurers stroke the anisphere one after the other, turn their hands on their shoulders, and even lift their torso to flirt with the anisphere.Uphilia watched the noise one step away. Everyone there was laughing, although it was harrowing where the torso was being lifted. Looks like fun from the bottom of my heart, to glorify Anisphere.\u201c\u2026 you don\u2019t mix?\u201c\u2026 yeah. Is that where you can stay because you\u2019re Anis? I don\u2019t have a seat. I\u2019m just a duke.\u201dIt was Tomas who had spoken to Uffi like that. One hand contains fruit liquor poured into the jock. Show one of them to Uffi.\u201c\u2026 you want a drink? It tastes poisonous if you need it.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll keep it.\u201dI take a jock with both hands from Tomas and hoist it for Tomas. You understand the intent, just a little bit. Tomas tells the head of the toast like he\u2019s in trouble.Uffi with fruit liquor in his mouth rounds his eyes. It\u2019s still different from the alcohol I\u2019ve had. But it\u2019s not that I\u2019m unfamiliar. Yes, it was a fresh discovery that I had tasted this flavor in cooking, for example.\u201c\u2026 even if it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re eating the same thing, some things are still the same\u201d\u201cIs it still different from what nobility drinks?\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fresh. I can\u2019t say I like it or I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s just novel and confusing.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Duke\u2019s Lady drinks with civilians. If you say you\u2019re anise and your senses are mahy, you are.\u201dIf the name of Anisphere comes out of Tomas\u2019 mouth, Uphilia\u2019s gaze will look for nature and the appearance of Anisphere. You\u2019re still tangled up by adventurers, you hear the energetically noisy anisphere voice and the laughter around you.\u201c\u2026 even if you say luxury, the Alliance will fill something in. It doesn\u2019t make sense if I emptied Anise\u2019s wallet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that\u2026 Lord Anis was reminded once again that the people like him.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. that guy looks good after all. No matter what the royalty is now told, it brought the distance too close. So we all feel close, and we expect it. I was wondering if that man would make his life better if he became king.\u201dUphilia frowned at Tomas\u2019 words. So much so that I accidentally shook my head left or right.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t be sure of that. Even if Ennis becomes king, he can\u2019t solve all the problems alone. Without the help of the nobles.\u201d\u201cNo matter how much civilians support it. It is the nobles who are moving your country\u2026. In fact, some civilians have become barons, but that\u2019s not why we\u2019ve become just as great ourselves. Instead, the distance just goes away.\u201dsays Tomas as he stirs up the fruit liquor. Uphilia also tilts the jock to imitate it.\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want the king to do something about it. If only he could live as he is, laugh freely, and live freely. That said, I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis was angry. I didn\u2019t hear this! That. Celestial, it was a wonderful demon sword. Honestly, my spine is poppy. We ripped open the clouds, and we opened the blue sky.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 what the hell\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Tomas groans unexpectedly with a slack face just saying what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t remember making anything like that.\u201cWhat, no matter what they say. Because I actually saw it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just that Master Anis is out of standard. I\u2019m not that big a deal.\u201d\u201cBe modest.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t get past it, but I can.\u201dUphilia shrugs her shoulders at Tomas, who squeals his nose. The noise of the feast didn\u2019t know where to stay, and I said the heat only increased.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s a long way off\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a king who wants. Thinking we have to beat this sight\u2026\u2026 too far away\u201dAnisphere will be a king loved by the people. Even without magic, there is a weapon: love for the people and the idea of magic. Enough, Uphilia is convinced that Anisphere has enough qualities to create a new era.I wonder if that\u2019s why I have to cross this sight if I\u2019m going to say I want to be king. From that thought, Uphilia closes her eyes and turns her thoughts around.\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t it that far?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like one of us has to do it. Or does it still look like it\u2019s not enough for Master Yufi to see this view?Tomas tells me. Uphilia turns once again to the centre of the festival.Everyone was so cheerful about shouldering and singing songs, it was a hustle and noise filled with happiness. The people are happy. We have ourselves there. If there is something missing, is there no nobility here?\u201c\u2026 no. This sight is full of happiness. Not before this, but as much as I\u2019d like to keep seeing this sight.\u201d\u201cThen we all have to work hard. You can\u2019t work alone. [M] Even if Master Anis works hard on his own, that\u2019s not true.\u201d\u201cSo with everyone\u2019s hands\u201dOn top of that, I said\u2026 Pompous and squeaky, Ufiria stirs up the jock she had in her hand at once and drinks up the fruit liquor.Thomas was surprised by the sudden good drinks of Ufiria, but the slightly reddish cheeks made Ufiria smile.\u201cSo I don\u2019t want that man to be king. Because there\u2019s that guy in everyone\u2019s reach. To protect the present.\u201dThat\u2019s all I can tell you, and Uphilia will go on walking to mingle with the center of the noise again.The jock that was left behind is a bad demeanor that I don\u2019t think is the Duke\u2019s Lady, but that kind of freaked me out for Tomas.Everyone is laughing.Surround that guy, look like he\u2019s having fun, look happy.Is this the sight this man wanted to see, the sight he wanted to protect, the sight he wanted to stay in?The figure of that guy approaching me step by step is full of energy, and I\u2019m relieved to say that he used \u201cdragon magic\u201d but without sequelae.\u201cDear Anis! Or I am grateful!\u201d\u201cWhoa, hey, Farna! Don\u2019t come hugging me all of a sudden!\u201cFe, I can\u2019t believe Fenrir, but I don\u2019t think I can anymore\u2026 uh-huh! Please don\u2019t retire ~! Dear Anis ~ ~!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re drunk, Farna! Hey, this, somebody! Peel off this crying Uedo! I\u2019ll bury it with my chest!\u2026 What is it? It was strangely frustrating.Is this what jealousy is all about? I\u2019m also reassured that I\u2019m still human when I can feel these movements in my mind. Let\u2019s just say that helps Anis out.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, Yufi\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201cThis one\u2019s mine.\u201dPull off Farna and get inside my chest. Then my surroundings shimmered, and I quieted back\u2026 huh? Is something wrong?\u201cYuyuyuyu, Yufi!? and suddenly what are you saying?!?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026?I feel fluffy in the head and strangely distant in my voice. This is drunk, isn\u2019t it? Did you get drunk with the air on the field? This me? Or did the fruit liquor not fit? I don\u2019t know, but your consciousness is clear, so you\u2019ll be fine.\u201cNo\u2026 Anis\u2019s assistant.\u201d\u201cOh, of that Duke of Magenta house\u2026\u201d\u201cMine\u2026 dude\u2026\u201dLooks like your temper\u2019s back. Above all. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the feast. I just wanted Master Anis to stay by my side.\u201c\u2026 Ufi, are you drunk?\u201c? Yes. A little fruit liquor\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Oh, uh, let go\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse\u201dWhy are you trying to leave? Master Anis needs to be here.That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be a king. I\u2019ll protect it. Not to make this man king. To be able to stay in such a happy place.\u201cAnd let\u2019s leave here once anyway?! Right? Yufi! Because she\u2019s a good girl!\u201cMaster Anis wants to be here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to now!? Yeah, don\u2019t look! It\u2019s not a show!!\u201d\u201cWhat a princess! You finally found your destiny!\u201cMen refuse! Playgirl to be nice to a pretty girl at last!\u201cYou must be saying bad things about people!? Yufi is asking!?\u201dWell, what is Playgirl\u2026? Occasionally, civilian language confuses you with words you don\u2019t quite understand.\u201cHey! Master Anis! Yabe, the knight\u2019s coming over here looking for Master Anis!\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, cancel the festival?!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! But the king is calling for Anis\u2026\u201d\u201c- Because I\u2019m not here! All right, everybody, have fun doing the rest!Master Anis blues his face slightly, takes my hand and runs out in momentum. Try to scratch the crowd, quick, quick.I will hold back Master Anis\u2019 hand, which connects my hands. The temperature in that hand is comfortable, it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a dream\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 kind of, my feet are fluttering.\u201cAll the time, Yufi!? It\u2019s okay!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m fine. But I\u2019d like to get some rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is it good because it\u2019s not popular? Oh, it\u2019s already a detour\u2026 it\u2019s not like Ufi!\u2026 What is it about being like me? Sure, this is a less popular backstreet, and it just seems like a place to be the blind spot for people\u2019s hustle and noise.Keep your back on the wall and your head flutter will only soothe a little. The feeling that the world is shaking is just a little disgusting, but not beyond indulgence.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMaster Anis needs to be happy.\u201dI got away from that view. But the truth is, he always wanted to be there.So I\u2019ll protect you. Just like you saved me from despair. I\u2019ll hold hands if you want to head to a cold place, too.\u201cI, today, this day, love that sight\u2026\u201dThe view the people are laughing at. You smile happily in it. If you become king, you will not reach the sight.\u201cI love this country where you are. I like you.\u201dOverlay your forehead with your hands on both cheeks of Master Anis so that you can catch him. Close enough to feel each other exhale.\u201cLove it, it is\u201dI love you.My lips layered to take my breath away were warm and as comfortable as I wanted to remain.Sooo, sooo, and I hear regular sleep.An invisible alley. Anisphere that covers her face with one hand against its wall and Uphilia that hangs on and sleeps while supported by such an anisphere.Only the moon looked down at Annisphere\u2019s cheeks turning bright red like ripe apples.\u201cReally\u2026 it\u2019s an anomaly, Uffi. Let me at least say I like it\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: 42\u2013 It was painful to dream of a day that was fun.It\u2019s always depressing to be sent back to the days when you couldn\u2019t just be a young child.I just lay my eyes down in front of reality, get rid of my emotions and smile vaguely at everyone.I keep giving up. I needed Raini Sian to live.\u201cLet\u2019s call it a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh, su, sorry!I make my shoulders jump on words spoken in a frightened voice with sighs.I shouldn\u2019t, it was when I was being taught by Master Ilia! I can\u2019t believe you skipped consciousness today. I thought I\u2019d stopped dreaming and settled down lately.Now I was in the middle of coaching on how to brew tea. The tea I was working on halfway through will be finished by Master Ilia. I drop my shoulders in my elusiveness as I look at its handiness.\u201cRaini, please sit down\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dUgh, don\u2019t get mad at me. I wonder if my focus has become more diffuse lately because I\u2019ve been as handy as I think I am. That makes me really disgusted. I\u2019m just sorry and I get a heavy response.But I can\u2019t hear the reprimand I expected when I get to my seat. I can only hear the sound at hand preparing the tea as it is and on the contrary I am restless\u2026\u2026\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cHuh? Um\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to get cold.\u201dThink about what I am right to do to point out Master Ilia. But I didn\u2019t even know if I thought about it. I\u2019m even suspicious that I was able to think in the first place. Just grab a teacup and have a cup of tea as prompted.The aroma and taste of the tea was such a gentle flavor that it would unravel the dull head of thought. I narrow my eyes to the warmth that goes through my throat. I accidentally get zero breath of relief.\u201cOh, um\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind. I kind of knew it wasn\u2019t here.\u201dIt was a pale reply to return when I conveyed my words of apology. As always, Master Ilia can\u2019t read her emotions. To be honest, I\u2019m a confused opponent.I accidentally drop my gaze on the teacup and look at it when I realize my face is showing. My own face without hegemony, I wonder if this is what I see from people right now. I think you look a little worried yourself.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201c\u2026 my dreams are a little bad\u201d\u201cIs it a dream?\u201cDream of when your mother was alive.\u201dMy voice was surprisingly flat when I grumbled.One day, Mr. Anise pointed it out to me. Memories of when you were happiest to me. I couldn\u2019t stand that now, comparing reality to its memory.And the big case I\u2019ve had. I have driven many people\u2019s lives crazy. I was wondering if I could still drink tea or something like this. So much so that I think so. I shouldn\u2019t have done this. I don\u2019t have time to lean down. Still heavy enough to drool my head\u2026\u201cMother. Mother\u2026 I guess it was a good mother to remember as much as it seemed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cMay I ask what kind of mother?\u201cHe was a free man. You took me out and showed me all kinds of views, and you don\u2019t even remember staying in one place, do you? Looks like he raised me on a journey.\u201dI wonder if it was to keep me from knowing who I am.My mother is likely a vampire. The demons spoken of in that gaga tale, but their identity is a little different, but they can\u2019t be described as ordinary people.The presence of me has shown it. Your mother wondered what that man thought he was living in this world. I wondered why I was traveling around.\u201cHe was a bright laugher. He really always laughed and gazed at me and talked about everything. I was really, really sweet and I loved it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but you\u2019re already dead\u201d\u201cYes, he had a poor quality disease\u2026 he said it would get better soon, but he also made sure I was ready to be taken to the orphanage, and stay asleep\u201dReally, your mother had died to sleep. I can still remember how cold my mother\u2019s hands were when she stopped moving and got cold.I was in an orphanage by the time I got that fact that I was dead. My mother was beaten by the reality that she was not coming to pick me up anymore.\u201c\u2026 life in the orphanage since then has been terrible. I didn\u2019t care that my life was painful. But things get taken, they get abused, and I thought,\u201d My work started, and I felt like I was something. \u201c\u201cOh, no more vampire charm by then\u2026\u201d\u201cProbably. That\u2019s why I liked one. I wish I\u2019d been knitting in my room or reading a book. How long have you been creepy and nobody\u2019s ever come near you?\u201dAnd I grew up gradually, too. He\u2019s there, but he\u2019s not there, he shouldn\u2019t be. With that in mind I was living my days like the air floating in an orphanage.That\u2019s when your father found me. The only thing I desperately protected that I didn\u2019t want to be taken. A pendant that is the shape of a mother. Something that the orphan doesn\u2019t get a little tense to have. This is all I can remember biting but protecting it through.\u201cAnd then there was the flow of your father welcoming me to the Baron Cyan house. My mother-in-law didn\u2019t blink that much either because it was a civilian ascent. You must have been fortunate to be a woman. If I gave it to my daughter-in-law, my adopted son would never have inherited the house.\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t get to be cute, did you?\u201cI think it\u2019s a fascinating force\u2026. It\u2019s so painful to live in a world where common sense is different, and my breath is stuck. I honestly gave up thinking that being admitted to an aristocratic college would just change my breathlessness.\u201dYour father desperately educated me as a noble lady so that I could find a good friendship. I\u2019ve never thought I\u2019d hate that. The way you told me you struggled a lot yourself and talked to me to keep my gaze on you is enough to remind me of your mother.I was glad to think that there was more blood connected to this guy. That\u2019s why I wanted to live as a noble lady. Your father would love to find a good friendship. I don\u2019t like studying, but it\u2019s hard to get along, but still trying to live without a wave.However, it was still not easy to live in the aristocratic world.\u201cSo I made a big mistake\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I think Prince Algard was approaching with confusion.\u201d\u201cYep. But will the others gradually become involved with me? Honestly, I was used to it, so I thought if I kept my distance, I should laugh at it unnecessarily even if I was approached. After that, there are rumors about what kind of a baroness the prince is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 hell it is\u201d\u201cDo you think so\u201dIn the end, when I realized it, I couldn\u2019t move. Whatever you do, you don\u2019t carry the situation as good as it gets. Nothing. I don\u2019t like anyone, and I don\u2019t even hate them. Whether they take things, or throw them down the stairs, or let bad reviews run through them, they can handle it if they\u2019re alive.After all, it won\u2019t work. Furthermore, I was desperate to discuss the break-up of Mr. Uphilia\u2019s engagement. I really didn\u2019t know what was going on. I wonder why these people are saying this.\u201cActually, I only allowed a little heart for Master Uphilia\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201cBecause he was the one who would embarrass me properly. So I was actually using it as a great reference. It didn\u2019t work out.\u201dBecause I wasn\u2019t as strong as that guy and I couldn\u2019t end up pushing someone away. I couldn\u2019t poke out that the mistake was a mistake. There was also the issue of the title, because I was afraid of the development of waiting ahead, which I obstinated from.So shut your mouth and put a lid on your heart too. I also blocked my ears and closed my eyes. I must have begun to reject the world to live. It was\u2026 Lady Anis who opened it again.\u201cNow, I\u2019m really calm. I think it\u2019s a peaceful place to finally feel safe.\u201dI don\u2019t hate my job as a samurai either. Silently cleaning and cleaning up is also good for the sex. Both Anis and Uphilia make me better. He knows about his powers, and he shows me how to use them.I\u2019m sure it seems so from the bottom of my heart that it\u2019s a privileged time even in my entire life. I should have told you I was happy. It should be.\u201c\u2026 and yet you can\u2019t. I just kind of dreamed it would rock me like this.\u201d\u201cNo. You must have been the mother I thought of by that time. Honestly, I envy you.\u201d\u201cEnvious, is it?\u201cYes, Raini and his mother.\u201dWith that said, Master Ilia carries his own brewed tea to his mouth. The graceful trick reminds me that this man is also a Viscount\u2019s maid.\u2026 That said, I haven\u2019t heard much about Ilaria\u2019s family. I\u2019ve been away from the palace for a long time, and I\u2019ve never seen you go home like Master Uphilia. You noticed my doubts, Master Ilia gave me an explanation.\u201cI look like I\u2019m being taken care of by the house. No, you might be closer to running away from home.\u201d\u201cRunning away\u2026?\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it when I go back. It must be my sincerity not to want to go back there. I\u2019ve never felt warm about family.\u201dI open my eyes and reveal my surprise at Ilya\u2019s words that I have never felt warm about my family. I was wondering if you have parents who think that way.Master Ilia broke her expression there. A troublesome smile, that was a look that saw the color of emotions that you couldn\u2019t normally see.\u201cI am the daughter of the Viscount family, but I was a pawn to gain power. To bond good luck and improve the voice of the house. She was just my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no\u201d\u201cSometimes my father sent me to marry someone because I couldn\u2019t find them. I wasn\u2019t as defiant of the house as I am now. The Anisphere picked it up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 what to say\u2026\u201d\u201cThe marriage partner is also about his father\u2019s age, and it\u2019s a rumor with a colorful family. If you want my Ilaria to go there, I\u2019ll take it! They caught me.\u201d\u201cThat guy, you really like to grab people\u201dI shrug unexpectedly remembering where I grabbed Master Uphilia. Then Master Ilia turned her eyes round and zeroed her laughter so that she was crazy and unable to indulge. Too rare.\u201cAnd then you\u2019re not leaning on the house. So I was finally reminded that I was good to live by my will. Because the Anisphere is too lively. The Anisphere has been well reprimanded by His Majesty and the Queen.\u201d\u201cFor once, we\u2019re talking about marriage\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. Well, sometimes I disagree and it went through safely. Though I seem to have switched policies thinking that if the house was surrounded by royalty at home too, I could smoke sweet honey. Well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not home. I don\u2019t have any honey to smoke.\u201dWow, spicy. That\u2019s what I thought by accident. That was enough to tell me that Ilia had no good feelings for her parents.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even given up your house, it seems like you\u2019ve left my book. Well, the honor of being chosen as a direct samurai of the princess is an honor if you don\u2019t say the truth. It would have been a better hustle and bustle if it hadn\u2019t been for the odd princess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really spicy\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. So Raini, you seem a little jealous.\u201d\u201c\u2026 my family loves me, from?Master Ilia nods quietly\u2026. I guess I should say that Ilia wasn\u2019t loved by her family. I think it\u2019s a terrible home environment, too.That\u2019s why I envy you. I feel strange when they say that. Even though it\u2019s warm, for some reason, I get backward and drop my gaze again.\u201c\u2026 loved, I wonder\u201dI am not a pure person. I\u2019m already a vampire. I\u2019m sweet with Anis that he accepts me even when I\u2019m a demon, and I\u2019m not human anymore.I can feel that people\u2019s blood is delicious, and I can feel that the feeling of magic has become different than before. I\u2019ve also gained my own strength. Fascination, mental interference, and then physical change. That\u2019s not normal anymore.I\u2019ve never been able to control that power, and I\u2019ve driven many people\u2019s minds crazy. Can I live to be forgiven for that?\u2026 anxious, afraid that one day, this tranquility will be lost again.And the favor that you love me. I was just scared when I thought that might have driven me crazy.\u201cAt least, I\u2019m going to love you\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI told you. My home environment sucked. I only knew that I loved people\u2026 and that I loved them. And the thought was directed only at Master Anisphere. His Majesty and I had loyalty to the Queen, but that was all I had\u2026. Until I\u2019m enchanted by you.\u201dI was shocked and opened my eyes to the words that Master Ilia smiled and uttered.\u201cYou seem afraid that your power will drive people crazy, but from what I\u2019ve told you, you think you\u2019ve learned better by giving them feelings that they have no reason to know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t you afraid? \u2018Cause that\u2019s not how you were born naturally, is it?\u201cIf you mean to do harm with it, fear it. But what should I fear from you, who are afraid and frightened?I say with a sigh of sigh as Master Ilia was frightened. I also lose my words to that and shut up. Master Ilia flaunts her shoulders like she\u2019s in trouble.\u201cYou are cowardly. But that\u2019s fine, Raini. If degrees pass, I\u2019m going to slap you in the butt, but I\u2019m disqualified as a lady when I\u2019m fearless and everything goes into a broken world sticking my neck in. Be a fine lady and apprentice Master Uphilia.\u201d\u201cNo, I was wondering if it would be impossible to be like Anisphere on a boulder or Uphilia\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. So you just have to choose the way of life that was at your height. It\u2019s that prep period now. At least nobody wants anything from you while you\u2019re away. There is also a way back as a baroness. There will also be a way to live as a squire, like me. The therapist Master Anisphere showed you? Was it? There are paths like that.\u201dMy future forecast maps shown one after the other. That makes me feel odd thinking about it one at a time. Tickled, yet heavy. It scratches my heart even though I think I\u2019m happy. The feeling of messing up is painful and holds my chest down.\u201c\u2026 Dear Ilia\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m happy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m scared. Also, when will this happiness fall to zero? Because I remember being happy.\u201dAs your mother is gone, I wonder if this happiness will be lost again one day, and that scares me, my heart and my legs.So I don\u2019t want you to touch happiness, and I want to run away. But the warmth of happiness is really comfortable, and I don\u2019t know what to do with what I\u2019m given in this hand.\u201cThen be strong.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Strongly\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYou can\u2019t keep what you want for those who don\u2019t grab it, even if it\u2019s given to you.\u201dMaster Ilia\u2019s words are not gentle. Just poke reality at me. But there\u2019s no pain. Hard, though painful. It tells me that\u2019s reality.The happiness you were protecting me from wrapping up has already been lost. That happiness seems to be taught that there is no going back. Still, there\u2019s something left for me to say I\u2019m happy.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s warm in here\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dIt\u2019s really warm. My worries are going to melt. It\u2019s warm and I still feel comfortable.He said he didn\u2019t have to have another nightmare for a while. I felt like stroking my chest down.\u2026 so maybe I should try to be a little more courageous, too, oh my god.Later, I was out of the royal castle. It has been a long time since I\u2019ve been out of the royal castle.When I told him I was going out, both Ennis and Uphilia sent me off with pleasure. I really appreciate that, and I really can\u2019t even lift my head to Ilia, who dropped me off when I left the Palace.I won\u2019t decorate you while you\u2019re there. It was me. I also got time to look back at myself and accept myself. So I have to start accepting me, too.The footsteps forward are only a little faster and I go along the nostalgic castle town to let my breath out a little. On his way was the mansion of the familiar Baron Cyan family.\u201cSir, please wait inside\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI know how you feel\u2026\u201dAt that entrance I saw a waiting father and an elderly butler exchanging words.My tear glands loosen just a little when I think you\u2019ve been waiting for me, but I smile at it and show it to you. Try never to rush your gait.\u201cFather!\u201c\u2026 Raini\u201dIf I walked over, my father would laugh and look at me like he was relieved and warped me.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re home well\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dLess words, exchange greetings for a reunion. Move the place straight to your father\u2019s private room so he can guide you.Your father\u2019s private room is decorated with splendid gear, demonic bones, etc. whether it\u2019s remnants from when he was an adventurer. I\u2019m a little scared to look at it again.\u201c\u2026 Was there any disabling?\u201cYep. I made it better for Master Anisphere. I\u2019ve reconciled with Master Uphilia.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dYour father shrugs as he closes his eyes and bites them off. The kindness of your father, who guides me first, is really warm when you feel it for a long time, losing strength from nature and body.I stroke my chest to make sure I feel like I\u2019m a family that I feel a little further away. It\u2019s not like being out of the palace, but it\u2019s a place where your mind can calm down.\u201cBut what\u2019s up? I was surprised to hear you were leaving.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got my mind sorted out, and I wanted to face the house properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well. Arianna will be delighted.\u201d\u201cHow is your mother-in-law?\u201cAfter that one incident on the boulder, I was feeling down, but now I\u2019m calm. After all, it\u2019s been a lot of hard work for you to be seen by a senior nobleman and move on to breaking your engagement\u2026\u201dArianna Cyan, my mother-in-law. I have heard that my mother-in-law is the daughter of the Viscount family and the youngest sister of many brothers. He said he made out with your father when he became a baron because he was his last daughter and developed into an engagement as it were.Even from my point of view, I\u2019m close to your father. He was a kind man who made me better too when he said he wasn\u2019t his own child\u2026. Though that may also be the effect of my charm. Now I can push that suspicion into my mind.\u201cI apologize again for the inconvenience caused to the house because of me this time\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening\u2026. and your vampire thing. There\u2019s nothing I could do about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know either, did you? My mother\u2026 told me Tillis was a vampire.\u201dI saw something like a color of regret in Tillis and his father\u2019s voice calling his mother\u2019s name.I\u2019ve heard you still love your mother. But I never heard the details. I thought it would be rude to dig for roots and leaves because my mother-in-law is here.\u201cI still don\u2019t know if your mother was really a vampire. I can\u2019t even look into it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 wondered if it would have been different if I had known I had you if I had known who Tillis was. I\u2019ve been thinking about that all these days.\u201dYour father groans with a bitter face. I don\u2019t know how your father and mother weren\u2019t together. But from the look on your father\u2019s face, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201cI love Arianna. But I never forgot Tillis\u2026. I don\u2019t want to betray Arianna for choosing me to be such an outlaw. But when I look at you, I don\u2019t like it, but I remember. You look a lot like Tillis.\u201d\u201cReally?I accidentally lost my aristocratic tone. Your father circled his eyes when he replied in a tone when he was a civilian. Then I deepen my grin about what was wrong.\u201cOh, it looks just like that. Just your face. Tillis was\u2026 more active.\u201d\u201cI understand. We\u2019ve been traveling together forever.\u201d\u201cRight. If he was interested, he would be happy to receive troublesome requests and requests to go away.\u201dMy father, who groans to miss the old days, feels that he really cares about the memories. Your mother was really taken care of, he said.\u201c\u2026 what do you want to do? Raini.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you want, what?\u201cAre you going to come back here? As far as I\u2019m concerned, you can just stay out of the palace and spend time under Master Anisphere. If it\u2019s hard on you, you don\u2019t have to come back here, do you? And seeing Arianna face to face\u2026 isn\u2019t that hard? Behave as a nobleman to you, who was more civilian than you were. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know how hard it is.\u201dThat was the word because you\u2019re the father who went from being an adventurer feat to being a baron.Even your father must have had a hard time. Being a nobleman and not embarrassed to live in a different world.\u201cI had Arianna beside me\u2026. There were some embarrassing reasons why Tillis had been forgotten. But maybe it was my fault that I asked you to do the same\u2026\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really going to disappear, and Tillis, who\u2019s gone from my sight, is really going to be behind my brain. That\u2019s why I wanted to keep it on hand. Like he disappeared at some point, he wants to prepare happiness with my hands if he\u2019s about to be unhappy. I thought that was what you could do\u2026\u201d\u201cI really still appreciate that\u2026. Father\u201dLook straight into your father\u2019s eyes and I exhale to calm myself down.\u201cI\u2019m still worried about how to live. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to me to decide right away. So now, I want to stay like this. Not yet\u2026 I just want to be a parent and child\u201d\u201cRaini\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, with your mother-in-law\u2026. because your father loved me as his daughter. \u2018Cause I haven\u2019t been able to repay the feelings that made me happy.\u201dI really wanted you to take me out. from a world that is just painful. Therefore it was not bitter to be a daughter of nobility. Even if further suffering awaited them\u2026. I can\u2019t believe I ever told you how I felt.\u201cAs good as your mother, your father is your father\u201d\u201c\u2026 uhh\u2026 yeah,\u201d\u201cThanks for finding me. Thank you for giving me my family again. I want to take care of this house more. I want to be your father\u2019s daughter, who sees me as a daughter, even if I\u2019m not a normal person.\u201dMy wish is to repay you. To the people who gave me something to replace the happiness I lost.To the father who brought me out into this world, to the mother-in-law who accepted me. To Lady Annis, who saved me, to Lady Uphilia, who gave me forgiveness. To Ilia, who shows me how to live.I neglected that fact when I found out I was a vampire. Even now, it\u2019s not yet accepted. Still, I don\u2019t want to just be stopped and given anymore.The only one who grabs happiness is one who tries to grab it with this hand. Because you told me so, I want to grab one so that I can be sure, although it may be an unreliable hand.\u201c\u2026 well. Then come back anytime.\u201dYour father laughed calmly and walked over to me and stroked my head. I close my eyes unexpectedly to the feel of a big man\u2019s hand, that gobbly hand.If I say I have no anxiety, I lie. My identity may be misaligned, or I may fail because I\u2019m not good enough. Still, I can\u2019t grasp anything for not walking out.I can\u2019t shine like those people, but I want to move on myself.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cI\u2019m home now\u201dTo one of my words, your father warped his face and said, \u201cWelcome back.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: 43\u2018Unfortunately, Princess Anisphere has a magical talent\u2026\u2019\u2018I didn\u2019t know any magic would react at all\u2026\u2019\u201cAren\u2019t you an abominable child\u2026?\u201cHow painful\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t use magic. No magic ever took shape.I\u2019d be lying if I told you I wasn\u2019t shocked by the fact that I couldn\u2019t use it.I heard sympathy from around, but it didn\u2019t bother me.Because it\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t use originally, so I can\u2019t help but use it.But I knew. There is always a beginning and an end to the world.There is more to the beginning and more to the end than the world is in front of me.So even magic has a beginning. That\u2019s why my heart jumped.How can magic be magic?What spirits are necessary to use magic?Why should I pray to the Spirit,Is the word of prayer anything good as long as it is in prayer?Where is the Spirit born, has a life span, etc.?Why can\u2019t I use magic? There may be a way to use it.Because that\u2019s where the magic is. If only that principle had been revealed, I\u2019m sure.There was no reason to mourn, only there was a desire to solve the mystery.There was no such thing as despair in the world. The magic remained unchanged and hopeful for me.Let\u2019s figure it out. Because it\u2019s my dream. Follow, reveal, and.I use magic. This determination of mine has not changed since that day.\u2026 I had such a nostalgic dream.\u201c\u2026 Hmm\u2026 I was asleep\u2026?My head is still asleep. I think it\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed a lot.Are these days of immersion in research, because it was also examining spirits and magic itself that hit the backbone more than the development of magic props? That is certainly reminiscent of the past. I wake up feeling unwittingly nostalgic and try to stretch my back.But when did you get back to bed yesterday? I have no memory at all\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 mmm\u201d\u201c\u2026 hmm?Rise and roll futon. There was a swell of someone sleeping apart from me.There was Yufi, who had her clothes open, resting quietly.\u201c\u2026 what?No, wait. Wait, Anisphere Wynn Palettia. We should be cool here. Let\u2019s just calm down and take a deep breath.Yes, it\u2019s premature to think something happened just because Uffi was asleep on the side. Look, you used to go to bed and stuff. Maybe that\u2019s what happened this time. He was sleeping with me just because I don\u2019t remember!Check the situation. Next to me is Yufi, whose clothes have been slightly opened. He said he was more exposed than usual, or he took off his clothes as he was and went into bed with his skin on. If you look over to the room, there are scattered clothes of me and Uffi that have been stripped away.From the interior of the room. This is Uffi\u2019s room. I\u2019m just wearing my skin, too, and I\u2019m not even wearing bedtime clothes. Cold sweat floats unexpectedly. Why can\u2019t I remember yesterday only at a time like this! My idiot!\u201cYu, Yufi. Oh, it\u2019s morning\u2026? Yufi?\u201dI accidentally rocked Yufi\u2019s shoulder. Maybe I was more upset than I thought. Shoulder shaken by me, Yufi slowly opens her eyes.Keep your eyes closed and rubbed, put your hands on your mouth and then yawned. Yufi smiled as if she was relieved to see me in her sight, keep her eyes closed\u2026\u201cTo, don\u2019t sleep twice! Yufi, even in the morning!\u201c\u2026 Mmm\u2026 Dear Anis\u2026\u201dYufi opened her eyes slightly as she called my name with a slightly pointed voice.Then I thought I had blinked a few times, and he looked up at me dissatisfied. Wow, bad eyesight\u2026\u2026 this could be a little scary.\u201cOh, good morning?\u2026\u2026Pu, and he turned his back. Oh, why!? It\u2019s my fault I\u2019m seeing a grumpy aura from my back for some reason!?\u201cYu, Yufi\u2026\u2026?\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWhy are you mad?!? Huh!? Yesterday, I did something!? Blood draws me away like I wore cold water. The clothes are scattered, they stay on each other\u2019s skin, they\u2019re in the futon together, and the grumpy Ufi, what, what did you do to me!?Did you have a drink yesterday? No, that doesn\u2019t leave any feeling at all. I haven\u2019t had time for that lately in the first place. I\u2019ve been focusing on looking into spiritual contracts, especially things that make me unconscious like my memory flies\u2026\u201c\u2026 ah. I remember.\u201dYes, yesterday. I often forget to sleep and eat once I\u2019m immersed. Yesterday, Yuffi forced me to take him in when I was reading through the materials in an effort to proceed with the investigation.Ilia has given up on this vice of mine, and she exercises her strength when she needs it. Raini wouldn\u2019t be that lame of a kid either. Then Yuffi said, yesterday she smiled and was hugged by Yuffi, thrown straight to bed, and taken off\u2026\u2026\u201cHoaaaah!?\u201dI remember! My face gets hot like it caught on fire when I remember. No, I sure didn\u2019t feel bad just being laid to sleep!? I didn\u2019t! They stripped me of my clothes, pushed me into a futon, and I just fell asleep\u2026\u2026!No, it\u2019s true, because Uffi is cunning. Because it\u2019s really cunning. Ku, damn, how could I be the only one to feel this embarrassed\u2026! That\u2019s a compliment! You must have taken care of yourself because you can\u2019t see me when you\u2019re immersed!\u201cYu, Mr. Yufi\u2026\u2026?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know anyone who triumphs.\u201dShit, I\u2019m so angry. I\u2019ve never seen Uffi so grumpy.I\u2019m going to do this all by myself. I\u2019m usually a good listener, but no, it\u2019s my fault! Duh, what do I do\u2026\u201cUfi, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you reflecting?He wakes up and stares at me as Uffi turns to me and blames me. The gaze pressure is strong\u2026\u201cis reflecting\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 the next time I do it, I\u2019ll force you to sleep\u201d\u201cHino.\u201dCome on, I want you to stop forcing me\u2026\u2026! At least I want it to be a way to prune my consciousness like Ilia\u2026\u2026!But gradually, I\u2019m losing my mind to Uffi. I feel like I\u2019m seeing a laughable future where I can\u2019t get my head up on Magenta parents and kids in line with my father. Father, let\u2019s have a drink together next time\u2026\u2026\u201cLet Ilaria or Raini clean up your clothes.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. I left it undressed\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. So\u2026 I\u2019m going to sleep until I get here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?Uffi catches me disappointed and pulls me into the futon. Uffi\u2019s exhalation is held tight enough to be felt beside him, and Uffi is trying to decide to sleep twice as it is.I held my breath unintentionally and stopped moving, but all at once the heat in my face goes up. Even if I scratch the algae trying to get it out, Uffi\u2019s power is stronger than I thought and I\u2019m not going to get away with it.\u201cNo, no, wait, wait! Let\u2019s calm down, Uffi! Misunderstood! Because it will be misunderstood! Because sleeping in this outfit will be misunderstood! I\u2019ll wake up! Yufi, I\u2019ll wake up! Because I apologize properly!\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201dI don\u2019t know!? No, the obstinate Uffi is cute, but Ilaria\u2019s gaze has been raw lately! Besides, I think you\u2019re laughing at me with your nose! Or laughed the other day! What kind of crap would they do if they saw this place\u2026!I tried to pull Uffi apart to get out, but he stroked me with his finger on my back. My body accidentally jumped back and my pitiful voice leaked.\u201cHiya.\u201d\u201c\u2026 let\u2019s go to sleep\u201d\u201cShh, spine, shh\u2026! Wow, no more sides! Because I laugh! Torture! Because it\u2019s torture!In the end, I gave up my impending destiny to accept that it was barren because Uffi was about to consume my strength.Then came Ilia for a while. When he saw me, he laughed at me with his nose.\u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant heckle.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you say to the Lord!?\u201dIt\u2019s a plush, scattered morning!\u2026 deserve it? Yes, yes, that\u2019s right! Hmm!Days also lay considerably from Fenrill\u2019s raid. We have been investigating the Spirit Contract ever since. I left the decryption of history that I had deposited from the Ministry of Magic to Ufi, and I was looking through a research paper on magic that had been kept in the Ministry of Magic.I borrowed a new one, wondering if there was any clue, but none of it was like approaching the magical backbone. They just talk about religious views to glorify magical miracles, and after all, it gives me zero breath of dismay that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much material to help me think. I come to the boulder.\u201c\u2026 Though I thought my thoughts were heretical\u201dIf I don\u2019t have a clue so far, I come to my heart. Although the decoding of Yufi\u2019s history is progressing, I am not very responsive. When I got here, I even thought it was intentional not to have a statement about the spiritual covenant at all.Spirit Contractor. It is he who covenanted with a collective so dense that he had himself among spirits such as the Great Spirit and God. There are terribly few records that we can see its existence in myths, legends, and myths, but it is real.In the first place, spiritual contractors have unlimited records of real people, even if the name is the one that emerges in myths and miga stories. Although the Spirit Contractor is said to have tremendous power, I don\u2019t know exactly what that is.Are the abilities different for each contracted spirit or do they have any common characteristics? What is necessary to reach the Spirit Contractor? Everything is bug-eating and missing pieces. Come on, I\u2019m losing my mood.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019d like to hear from the Spirit Contractor himself when this happens.\u201dThe story hasn\u2019t come from your father yet. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s difficult to negotiate, but I can\u2019t seem to hear from you right away. It\u2019s stuck if it stays like this.Still, I can\u2019t help but do something and reach for my next paper to see.\u201c\u2026 oh?I was unanticipated by the content. It was a paper called \u201cThe Differences Between the First Spirit of Light and the Dark Spirit, Compared to the Four Spirits\u201d.The content is focused on the Spirit of Light and Darkness. Whereas the magic of fire, water, earth, wind spirits, and derived subspecies of spirits that are considered the four Spirits often have entities, the magic of light and darkness often does not have generations to form. Think about what the original is from this fact, etc.\u201cFire, water, earth, wind. These magic most often involve some form of activation, including the subspecies spirits derived therefrom. In contrast, light and darkness each have no form alone, and magic has fewer entities. It is intangible from the original supposed light and darkness, aren\u2019t these two inherently identical\u2026\u201dHeh, that\u2019s an interesting paper. I\u2019m also a little surprised about the supposed first attributes of light and darkness, but light and darkness in this world are not conflicting beings, are they?Thanks, in the knowledge of previous life, light and darkness are often contested or used as symbols of conflict, but not in this world.Light and darkness are neighboring and melting beings. So much so that some discourses say that light and darkness are wrapping the world by joining hands, producing day and night, and turning to each other.And as this paper suggests, light and darkness is a lot of magic that doesn\u2019t have a solid-like entity. To give you an example, the magic of healing that Ufi also used is the magic of light and darkness, right?To be more precise, light healing is right for injuries, but it is used separately because dark healing works for the temper. Furthermore, by adding other attributes, healing magic is increasingly derived.I have thought that medical technology has not developed because healing magic is excellent before, but I think this is a major reason why medical technology that does not rely on magic does not develop.Even in bulk with healing magic, some wizards specialize in good healing magic because there is actually a wide variety of magic.What is even more surprising to me is that many have the aptitude of light and darkness together. Only light, only darkness, is rarer. Or there are many combinations of light and any of the four major attributes, darkness and any of the four major attributes. But this is also a handful. Basically, light and darkness are treated as sets.To my knowledge, light sees a tendency to strengthen the potency of existing attributes or to increase the intensity of matter and magic itself, and darkness tends to fog magic, contrary to this, or to weaken its nature.In this theory, I thought Raini\u2019s mental interference was also an attribute of darkness, but I don\u2019t know if I can verify it in detail.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.(\u2026 I wonder if Yufi\u2019s magic is awesome because he\u2019s also fit for light and darkness)More than just the magic of the four Spirits, it can be strengthened by combining light and darkness, the first of its kind. Wouldn\u2019t it be due to this combination that Yufi\u2019s magic is amazing?What I want to sum up in this paper is that if light and darkness were supposed to be the first, it would have been intangible. If it is assumed that the four great spirits were born from the beginning, it is presumed that the creation of this world has become tangible from intangible. What great feat was there to get there?It depicted praise for God as I put it on from there, and I accidentally blew it out. The real issue isn\u2019t a tribute to God, but I feel like it\u2019s a cluttered way of writing as if I\u2019m forced to write about it.\u201cSome people thought this way. Sounds like a pretty old paper, but who wrote it?I scroll through the pages trying to find out the name of the person who wrote the paper. Seeing that name, I turned my eyes round.\u201cHey, Uffi?\u201c\u2026 Yes? What is it? Dear Annis.\u201dYufi looks up at me as I was in the process of organizing the material. I ask with my fingers the name of the person who wrote the terrifying paper.\u201cNerschel Bougainvillea\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s your mother\u2019s maiden name\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!? Yeah, I wrote this. It\u2019s Mrs. Nerschel!?\u201dAre you kidding me?\u201cWhat house is Bougainvillea\u2026?\u201cI don\u2019t work for the royal castle. You\u2019re away from Wang Du, too. I\u2019ve been to the Marquis de Bougainville, but it\u2019s a peaceful place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Marquis. The territory feels like an idyllic countryside?\u201cYeah, your mother said it was just right for maintenance. The Marquis Bougainvillea family is full of serenity, but her mother is quite a stranger among them, and she has been married to her father in one\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, what\u2019s bothering me?\u201dI\u2019m super concerned about Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s taming. Um, it seems pretty old that I put out this paper, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve studied or written a paper in particular right now.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cUffi, can I follow you home to the home of the Duke of Magenta?\u201cI don\u2019t mind that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to hear a little bit about Mrs. Nerschel, and it\u2019s time to talk to Caind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, sorry for the inconvenience\u201dYufi\u2019s brother, Caindo. They haven\u2019t been able to make up well with him yet. I knew I had to get along better than I was the one who caused it. Even that could take Uffi out of the Duke of Magenta house.And, yeah. I would like to hear Mrs Nerschel\u2019s story. This paper, which seeks to approach the truth, the essence, rather than theology, strongly inspired my curiosity. I want to hear more about how the hell you think and capture things for once.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know at home.\u201d\u201cYeah. Please\u201dI hope it\u2019s also a distraction for Uffi. I\u2019ve been heading to my desk lately to decode history and organize materials.Well, that\u2019s why I did it, the Duke of Magenta house! I guess I\u2019ve been disturbing you since I came to say hello to you about keeping Uffi.This time Yufi and I, we came alone. Sometimes I want Ilia and Raini to get some rest.\u201cWelcome home, lady. And welcome, Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m back now. And your mother?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll wait in the guest room. Please, I\u2019ll show you.\u201dAn elderly butler greets us and leads us straight to the guest room where we leave our bags and the maids carry them.If we went straight into the guest room, Mrs Nerschel would be waiting for us about her seat. He laughs at us as he walks over, taking his seat.\u201cWelcome home, Uffi. And welcome, Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for allowing me to visit today\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d see my thesis when I was younger.\u201dOh ho ho, says Mrs. Nerschel, laughing at her mouth hidden. If you take your seat as it is urged, the butler will brew you a cup of tea and serve it with tea treats.Eat sweets when you pick them. Um, the Duke of Boulder house. You\u2019re eating good food, aren\u2019t you?\u201cI\u2019m here today to talk to you about your paper, but\u2026 can\u2019t you say hello? Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201c? Greetings?\u201cI\u2019ve had a good relationship with my daughter, so I thought you\u2019d say hello.\u201d\u201cOhhhh!? Ohh, ho\u2026!There\u2019s sweets in my throat, sweets\u2026! Yufi, who was sitting next to me, strokes my back. I manage to catch my breath and face Mrs. Nerschel again.\u201cUh, well, as for\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh, you\u2019re doing a lot better\u2026 the\u201dWhat am I supposed to say!? Master Nerschel is laughing strangely, and even Yufi!? I can only stop staying and narrow my shoulders and shrink\u2026!\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think Princess Anisphere was that much of a wife.\u201d\u201c\u2026 make it a fallen weakness.\u201d\u201cOh, well! It is!Duh, what kind of torture is this\u2026 Shit, I wasn\u2019t thinking about this development at all! This needs to change the subject quickly\u2026\u2026!\u201cSo? How long have you been thinking about dating?\u201cDuh, to what extent!?\u201d\u201cBecause even if my lovely daughter devotes her life, she will serve. You don\u2019t have any parents you don\u2019t care about, do you?\u201cWell, that\u2019s true\u2026 I certainly didn\u2019t mean to make you happy\u2026\u201d\u201cThat you could marry Yufi?\u201cHow could you talk like that?!?\u201d\u2018Cause it bothers me.That\u2019s definitely the only element I care about, and as a parent, I\u2019m probably worried about you. Whoa!? I just feel like I\u2019m sitting on a needle. Whoa!?Yufi, you\u2019re turning away, but you know you\u2019re laughing!? What are you laughing at!?\u201cIn the first place, we\u2019re same-sex\u2026!\u201cYou still like each other, don\u2019t you?\u201cAnd you don\u2019t blame\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s more of a burning side. I\u2019ve been keeping this kid\u2019s freedom bound ever since. If Yufi wants it, I\u2019m going to support it as much as I can.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m relieved\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019d like to ask you again how far Princess Anisphere likes Uffi, right? I\u2019ve publicly stated that I like women since I was a child, but if I could have a lover, would I be that beginner?\u201cTo, nya! Yikes!Stop it! Because it\u2019s becoming my black history these days! And lover!? lover\u2026!? now they say lover!? no, i dont deny that, but other people tell me, and their parents tell me, they die of embarrassment\u2026\u2026!Then I tried to pursue it several times, but every time Mrs Nerschel turned me back on topic. Somebody help me!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44: 44Where shame rose in Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s pursuit and she was about to surrender completely, she coughed up and Uffi put out a helpship for me.\u201cMother, that\u2019s enough to make fun of Master Anis\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean to tease you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re good friends.\u201d\u201cOh, well! If so, is Uffi more aggressive?\u201c\u2026 to the extent that we share a bedroom together\u201d\u201cHey!?\u201dThey made me look like a help ship and knocked me down under the waterfall!? Mrs. Nerschel started shining her eyes!? Why is Yuffi even flat?!?\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to be upset about, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cYa nasty thing\u2026!\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cUh-huh!?\u201dNo, don\u2019t! My shame will shatter!! Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s raw warm gaze is hard! I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die of embarrassment like this\u2026\u2026! I want to bury it already\u2026\u2026! Actually, you\u2019re still mad about the all night habit, Yufi!? Okay, I won\u2019t do it anymore! Forgive me!Did my desperate prayers arrive, Yufi and Mrs. Nerschel finally changed the subject for me. Ugh, my heart has been brushed down for nothing\u2026\u201cSo how did you get my old paper again? I heard you were looking into spiritual contracts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the material that was kept in the Ministry of Magic is so inclined to the content of theology, there are many parts that are not helpful in terms of records as facts\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I see. I know exactly how that feels.\u201d\u201cAgain, Mrs. Nerschel did the same thing?What I could feel from Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s paper was the pursuit of the truth: magic. The respect, faith, and moral suggestion of beings such as God and the Spirit were to an extent accompanied.I mean, it\u2019s not really about the side of faith in magic. It could even be described as heterogeneous in the papers kept in that Ministry of Magic.\u201cI don\u2019t have faith, I don\u2019t mean to scorn faith, but I thought we should be separated from the mystical pursuit of magic. That\u2019s what Princess Anisphere said. I thought it was necessary to state the facts alone.\u201d\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I snort a lot, but haven\u2019t there been any changes in the policy of the Ministry of Magic since then?\u201cThat\u2019s right. So at the time, some factions said it was an innovative thesis, and some were diagnosed with entering the Ministry of Magic. I said no.\u201d\u201cDid you say no? Why?\u201d\u201cIf I go into the Ministry of Magic and be the flag bearer, I will create a force. I said no at the time when we were trying to work together to stabilize His Majesty\u2019s reign.\u201dAhhh\u2026 is that also the time. The Ministry of Magic occupies an important place in the Kingdom of Palletia. He said that his father was struggling with his reign at the time, so did he ask him not to stand in the way of it? That makes me feel a little uncomfortable.\u201cSo who married Lord Grants?\u201cBecause I was the one who had that conversation at the time. I was just about to get married. At first, he had no romantic feelings, and when he was watching the beauty of his magical fitness, he couldn\u2019t decide on his fianc\u00e9e either, so he put his hands together and made a fake engagement.\u201d\u201cHas the disguised engagement really become?\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with distance while I\u2019m dating, and I\u2019m staying that way.\u201dLord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel, was that such a tame start? I can\u2019t believe the disguise is real. But it certainly didn\u2019t seem like Lord Grants had normally decided on a fianc\u00e9e, and if I were convinced, I might be convinced.I look like a good couple now, and I have a history of meeting people, and so on.\u201cSo you were a root researcher.\u201d\u201cRight. Ever since I got married, I\u2019ve been busy as Duchess, and the person I could talk to was about my husband and His Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat!? Father too!?\u201d\u201cOh? Haven\u2019t you heard of it? Once upon a time, His Majesty Orphans was interested in landscaping and farming, and he studied it with a hobby? I really like growing flowers and crops, that one.\u201d\u201cI had no idea\u2026\u201dBut I think it\u2019s a father\u2019s hobby\u2026. If I could retire early, I wonder if you could build me a personal garden or something to study. I haven\u2019t had a hard time before. I think that\u2019s as good a use as it gets.I wonder if that\u2019s why your father showed understanding in magic, too. I think from the bottom of my heart that my father was a good father. I think I\u2019ll walk over some more. He said he would regret not keeping the filial piety within his means.\u201cNeither did I think I could talk about that paper now\u201d\u201cIt was very curious.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of Princess Anisphere? on the relationship between primitive light and darkness and the four major attributes: fire, water, earth and wind\u201d\u201cIf you follow the myth, the first thing in the world was light and darkness. In other words, it is assumed that the world began with intangible beings and that four major attributes were later born. This is because of God\u2019s work.\u201dI don\u2019t deny this either. Well, I\u2019m almost sure this world is a planet just like Earth. It\u2019s just knowledge from previous life\u2019s knowledge, though I keep it to 90% certainty because I haven\u2019t tested this world itself.Then I guess there was the beginning of the planet, but I don\u2019t remember the details around here. I don\u2019t know if that was born with nature, or if God created the world as it is told in mythology. However, there are certain conclusions at this point in my mind.\u201cIf we speak on the assumption that there is a God, then perhaps the primitive attribute of light and darkness is God himself\u201d\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t you hate theology?\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but cutting it is inseparable. Regardless if it is just simple material light and darkness, light and darkness presumed to affect magical effects are too different in colour to be arranged as magical attributes together with the four major attributes. That\u2019s true of being intangible, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I want to focus on\u201d being intangible but having influence over things that are shaped. \u201c\u201c\u2026 material light and darkness, is it? But there\u2019s no form in light or darkness, is there?Yufi leans her neck wonderfully. Surprisingly, so is Lady Nerschel. Yeah, but if I think about it on the assumption that light and darkness in magic are intangible, it\u2019s weird when compared to my knowledge.\u201cGlow, you can\u2019t open your eyes if you\u2019re too strong\u201d\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\u201cI mean, even if it doesn\u2019t have shape, it does exist at a time when it\u2019s affecting matter. But the magic light is different, and so is the darkness. It\u2019s not material, it just seems to work conceptually.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s interesting that light exists as a substance. But you can\u2019t touch the light, can you?\u201cNo, I\u2019m touching it. It\u2019s just not big enough for us to recognize it as a form\u2026. right. Would you like a little sugar?Take the sugar that was prepared with the tea and I scratch it as I drop a spoonful of sugar into the tea. The grains of sugar dissolve and become dispersed in the tea.\u201cNow the sugar is invisible, but indeed there are grains of sugar blended into this tea. Even if we become invisible grains like this, they exist as substances. In this respect, light is working on matter, but perhaps we should refer to the state in which this is not working as darkness. Well, when I get to know more about it, I can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201dIs light a grain, a wave? Certainly quantum mechanics? I don\u2019t know the exact place with the knowledge I just remember with such a bare memory. Even if this world looks the same in the first place, it doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s working under the same laws. So I can\u2019t say for sure, there is magic.I was in the middle of talking about magical light and darkness in the first place. Yeah, let\u2019s get back to it.\u201cLight and darkness in magic, this is also linked by myths and legends as neighboring beings. I mean, it\u2019s the same, but I guess it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\u201cThe opposite of working?\u201cIf light is an acceleration, darkness slows down. If light is to be activated, darkness is sedation. But the power to work is the same. I think that\u2019s the difference between the power on the side that moves and the power on the side that stops it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Interesting! I do have a few things in mind.\u201d\u201cThe healing magic of light acts on the flesh because it is activating the flesh. It is believed that the magic of healing of darkness acts on the spirit because mental illness is often caused by the load on the spirit and helps to alleviate this\u2026\u201d\u201cOh! I would have liked to hear that story sooner! Princess Anisphere!\u201dMrs. Nerschel takes her seat vigorously, grabbing my hands and shaking them left and right. Oh, oh, something about Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s tension going up on the eel climb!?A little bit and Mrs. Nerschel also settles her excitement, she laughs, hiding her mouth so that she can sit in her seat and delude herself, looking just a little embarrassed. Yufi was a little cute looking round her eyes at Mrs. Nerschel like that.\u201cIndeed, each of the magic of light and darkness is rarely used alone. Moreover, most people possess the fitness of light and darkness in alignment, and fewer possess only one fitness. It may have in addition to the aptitude of the four great spirits and subspecies, but maybe that just doesn\u2019t meet the standards laid down by man. I thought His Majesty Orphans was a good example.\u201d\u201cDoes Father only have light and darkness, one aptitude?\u201cYour Majesty only possesses the aptitude of light. Besides healing magic, I used it to grow plants.\u201d\u201cHa ha, I see\u201dTo say that you don\u2019t have aptitude in magic is just to say that you can\u2019t handle magic that just transcends standards, which is not the case with cases where you can\u2019t use magic completely like I do.My father seems to tell me he\u2019s only fit for light, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s just because he\u2019s not good at it, he\u2019s not fit for darkness. Suitability is only a matter of standards set by people.\u201cI see. This is the discipline of magic\u2026\u2026 10 more years, no, 15 years I wanted to see you soon. Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cWe are delighted to hear your assessment\u201d\u201cHehe, if I was about the same age as Yuffi, I might have grabbed it from the side.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt\u2019s not a line to put your hand on your cheek like that and smile gently, Mrs. Nerschel!?\u201cI wonder if Princess Anisphere will come to adopt the Duke of Magenta\u2019s family once Yuffi has gone to the royal family to adopt him?\u201cNo!? What are you talking about!?\u201d\u201cJust kidding, kidding\u201dReally no? That was the voice that made me want to hear it. I mean, my eyes looked a little serious and I was scared. This family has too much eyesight\u2026\u201cMother, that\u2019s all you have to play with\u201d\u201cOh, jealousy? Yufi.\u201d\u201c\u2026 jealousy, do you say? It\u2019s unpleasant for your mother to take the anise.\u201d\u201cUnpleasant! Ugh, you\u2019re starting to say that too.\u201dBye, Ababa!? That\u2019s what Yufi says again! Yufi\u2019s got a little lip pointy, and Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s laughing like she\u2019s in her bump. What is this?Where Mrs Nerschel exhaled, laughing strangely for a while, she cuts out the subject.\u201cIs it to explore spiritual covenants that we examine the formation of spirits?\u201d\u201cRight. Because there are so many ambiguous expressions, such as the terms and qualifications of spiritual contracts.\u201d\u201cRight. I hear spiritual contractors have a lot of unique sensibilities.\u201d\u201cHave you also met Mrs. Nerschel with a spiritual contractor in our country?Speaking of which, I was wondering. If your father knew you, Mrs. Nerschel would have met you.\u201cI\u2019ve seen him before, but not when he tells me he\u2019s close. Yeah, it\u2019s just a coincidence of interest.\u201d\u201cIs it a match of interest?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m glad you actually met to confirm that. In my opinion, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be bad.\u201dMmm, what a strange rhetoric. I wonder if the idea of a match of interest is as if we\u2019re having feelings for each other. It seems like some kind of pale relationship though.\u201cSpeaking of which, wasn\u2019t today\u2019s visit just about the paper?\u201cYep. I haven\u2019t been face-to-face with Caindkun before, so I thought I\u2019d talk to him properly. He said that Uffi was still avoided.\u201d\u201cOh, and that kid too\u2026 He used to say everyday that if Yuffi were to be queen, he would support his sister so that he wouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be the Duke\u2019s head\u2026\u201dGiven Lord Grants\u2019 position, it is a story that is uncomfortable if you think you will take over afterwards. However, if that person to serve treated my beloved sister unreasonably, I can\u2019t help but doubt it.I hope today it leads to unwrapping that pan. I guess I won\u2019t know that until I see you face to face. As far as my previous reputation is concerned, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad kid.\u201cShall we call it now?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIf you like, please\u201dI nod at Mrs Nerschel\u2019s suggestion, looking sideways at the slightly nervous faceted Uffi.Have a cup of tea as I escort the butler out of the room at Mrs Nerschel\u2019s direction.\u201cBy the way, are you going to tell Cain that you and Yufi are in love?\u201cBlah blah.\u201dI accidentally swallowed it. That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got today!? Shame on Yufi for gently rubbing my back. Yay, sad one. Whatever it is, breathe and cough.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Honestly, what do you think of same-sex and romance?\u201cConsidering it\u2019s not common, and the position of the two of you, are you thinking about how you can handle inheritance? And that makes me nervous.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dAfter all, that problem cannot be avoided. I need to do something someday, but honestly, I don\u2019t want to think about it. That\u2019s true of me myself, and I don\u2019t like that Ufi can do those kinds of opponents.I\u2019m also thinking about adopting a child, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no problem. The roundest thing is to get a proper son-in-law when you get to the throne. Oh, I have a headache and a heavy temper.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to get away with it, we have to do one of the reprimands, but if we\u2019re going to solve each other\u2019s problems, I\u2019m not going to tell you anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you. I still want to be happy with Yufi.\u201d\u201cOh, well. Thank you again for your daughter.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIf I am carefully bowed my head, I also have to correct my posture and reply. I wonder if it was my fault that Mrs. Nerschel, who raised her head, seemed somewhere relieved.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t think Princess Anisphere looked alike\u2026 but she\u2019s the Queen\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHe was admired by the same sex, too, right? His Majesty Orphans, it was a straight line, so I stayed only admired by the far-winded.\u201d\u201cOh, I can see that somehow. It\u2019s good to take care of her, isn\u2019t it, Mother?\u201dThen Princess Anisphere inherited it.\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201dBut my mother also had such a past, which attracts a bit of interest. Next time, I wanted to hear about your fathers. I\u2019ve drawn a line somewhere before and I\u2019ve never even heard of it in private\u2026I heard a knock when I was a little blurry. There are signs of people coming from across the door. Is the butler back?\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019ve brought Lady Caind\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dImmediately after Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s reply, the door opens and one boy enters the room.My first impression is he\u2019s a luxurious boy. Or farsighted, I\u2019m going to lose track of my gender. If we get closer, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s a boy.And he looks so neat. The hair colour is silver hair conceded by Mrs. Nerschel, and the colour of the eyes is in deep but vibrant red tea. Yufi was also a tough beauty, but Kaindo is also a beauty with different hairs. I get a soft impression somewhere compared to Yufi.It\u2019s just the intensity of the eye that makes that impression misty, too. Can\u2019t blood contend, I feel a strong gaze of pressure. What, do the Dukes of Magenta want to beam it out of their eyes?\u201cExcuse me, Mother. Caind, I\u2019m here now.\u201d\u201cCaind, Princess Anisphere has asked to see you. Say hello.\u201dCaindo-kun moves in and out of my way, prompted by Mrs. Nerschel. Kneel and drool your head as you take your benefactor\u2019s gratitude. I have zero breath of admiration without thinking about pretty sophisticated behavior. The boulder is only a trace of the house of the Duke of Magenta.\u201cIt\u2019s Caindo Magenta. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Anisphere Win Palettia. It\u2019s good to see you today. I am doing well for your sister, and your parents. Keep your head up.\u201dI was about to be in princess mode too. Somehow, you mean you get tight? Kaindo-kun is even more remarkable, although it is something that Yufi felt. I\u2019m going to embarrass this one if I don\u2019t be somewhat cautious.Take my word for it. Kaindo-kun is turning his gaze straight at me. I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just staring or staring because of the pressure of that gaze\u2026\u2026 no its really hard to understand Duke of Magenta house!?\u201cI wanted to get closer to you today and solve your misunderstandings.\u201d\u201c\u2026 misunderstanding, is it\u201dWow, I\u2019m scared. My voice pointed sharply like a blade. You look just like Lord Grants in these places!Keep a loving laugh on your back as you accidentally get a cold sweat coming out of you. Have you been intimidated by younger people lately? Isn\u2019t that strange? Me, the princess, right? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s majestic or anything! I feel something irrational about the world!\u201cThe misconception is that you can explain Prince Algard\u2019s actions against his sister from the break-up of his engagement to today?\u201cNo, I\u2019m really sorry about that my brother\u2026\u201dI\u2019m sorry, too. Come on! I have no sympathy for Al, but come on! It\u2019s time for me to get mad too, isn\u2019t it?!? It\u2019s more or less an Al Kun butt wipe!?Caindo-kun\u2019s gaze will grow stronger on the words of apology that have come out of his grudge. This is scary\u2026\u2026! I feel Lord Grants\u2019 blood muscles\u2026\u2026!\u201c\u2026 what will royalty do with his head so easily bowed? Are you going to admit no?\u201cIt\u2019s an informal place, so miss it. Yeah, I\u2019m gonna let you go vegan from here, but I\u2019m really sorry about Yuffi\u2019s breakup.\u201dI would like to emphasize that this is only an informal place. I do know how easy it is to say that royalty shouldn\u2019t bow its head.The air seemed to get tingly nervous. Caindo-kun is the cause of that. Yeah, now you\u2019re pre-adult\u2026? You have too much style\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re saying it\u2019s informal, can you say something from me, too?\u201cGo ahead. I came here today to take your grievances, your grievances without any further ado. You can say whatever you want. I can\u2019t listen to insults to the royal family, but if they\u2019re to me, I\u2019ll listen to them. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dI can\u2019t be fooled by intimidation. Because if we don\u2019t hang on here, Yufi and Kaindo-kun might make up for it a long way back. Sometimes it\u2019s a virtue not to talk, but this time if you\u2019re firmly dissatisfied, you have to talk!\u201cNow, let me be frank. The royal family wonders what my sister\u2019s devotion is.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really royal about that, or a form involving Ufi in the circumstances of me and Al Kun. If you want to bow your head, it\u2019s me and Al, not the royal family. Yufi\u2019s been trying so hard for me. Now you\u2019re with me as my assistant, but I\u2019m helped by the extraordinary.\u201d\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t that just convenient to use your sister?\u201c\u2026 Caind, even though it\u2019s too much for you to forgive me.\u201dWhat, hey!? Why are you shouting like that low roar all the way to Ufi!?Or that the pressure on each other\u2019s gaze is too strong! My spine!! I\u2019m scared!!\u201cSister.\u201d\u201cI serve Lord Anis of my own free will. As for Master Algard, it\u2019s because of his impudence that I couldn\u2019t save your heart without. There\u2019s a lot of difference between the royal family trying to use me.\u201d\u201cMy sister herself does. But I don\u2019t see her around. If you don\u2019t show it in a way that you know, you won\u2019t be able to convince your surroundings.\u201d\u201cSo for that reason, I\u2019m helping Anise to contribute to magic.\u201d\u201cIs it magic, magic\u2026 Is that really research for the country? I do not deny the achievement itself. But isn\u2019t that idea too much for this country?\u2026 Ooh, that\u2019s a heartbreaking word for Mr. Anisphere, Kaindo.I\u2019m used to that because they\u2019ve been saying it for a long time. Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201cCertainly, Master Anis\u2019 magic is something original. It will take time to penetrate both among the people and among the nobles. And that\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d\u201cMy sister is responsible for that,\u201d he said?\u201cThat\u2019s all magic is worth. And it\u2019s worth serving Master Anis as well. I will continue to appeal aloud, no matter who denies it.\u201d\u2026 That\u2019s crazy. Me, I was supposed to be here to make up for these two. Why are they all staring at each other in a fight\u2026? Me, something wrong\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Keep it that way.\u201dThey\u2019re staring at each other with their fighting hips. Mrs. Nerschel came in to stop me as I grated at Ufi and Caind, who kept their gaze together but took their gaze off as if the thread of tension had broken.\u201cSit here, Caind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dKaindo-kun sits next to Mrs. Nerschel across the street. This is how we turn around again, but Caindo-kun\u2019s signs remain somewhat pointy. Um, I guess I\u2019m not really impressed.Or, if we fail to make up here, the later is awkward. Whatever happens in the future, we\u2019re going to continue our relationship with the House of the Duke of Magenta, and I want to create a good relationship here. Cough it up so I can get my mind back on it, and I\u2019ll face Caind-kun back.\u201cKaindo-kun appreciates the achievements of magic itself, right? Especially if you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s in the national interest, and then you\u2019re worried about my personality and ideas?Caindo-kun won\u2019t say anything just to return his gaze to my inquiry, but he won\u2019t say anything back, so there\u2019s no objection.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell the truth, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good royalty. That\u2019s more of a story now. I\u2019ve been acting like I should, too, and I never dreamed the throne would roll over. I don\u2019t feel like I deserve it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I have a consciousness that I\u2019m not feeling good enough as a royalty,\u201d he said?\u201cOf course. I think it\u2019s a minority to snort when asked if they want to serve such a king. Not on my own. I don\u2019t think so.\u201dI really thought you were a minority. I found out that someone appreciated me more than I thought and cared about me. Don\u2019t be ashamed, I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t either. But there\u2019s too much missing for me, isn\u2019t there? Magic, time, mindset.So I think I\u2019m going to bump into people who have doubts like Caindkun. If I were to be king, I would be. If you don\u2019t have to be king to spread magic, it\u2019s a problem you have to face.\u201cI know I\u2019m not good enough. That\u2019s why I want an understander. And the people who can help. That\u2019s why I want to discuss it. Until now, I didn\u2019t think it had to be understood, but I want to change that attitude.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you saying that this is how you set the scene up to gain my understanding?\u201cStay close, I wouldn\u2019t even say. It\u2019s just that Yufi is walking with me. I want to take care of Yuffi\u2019s family. I don\u2019t want to leave the status quo, where I or the royal family are confused for a reason. Even if it seems like an extra treat.\u201dCaindo-kun narrowed his eyes thinly. Is it because you\u2019re still young that you haven\u2019t hidden your emotions from seeing them? That\u2019s right, I suppose. If that\u2019s what you think, there was something praiseworthy about Al, that stupid brother.\u201cI can\u2019t help but say all my hopes. What do you want me to do, Caindo?\u201c\u2026 what do you want me to do, what?\u201cYou\u2019re dissatisfied with me because you don\u2019t like the way I swing, do you? But I have an idea of my own, something I can\u2019t even give way to. I don\u2019t understand this around me any more than I think, I don\u2019t get endorsement either. That\u2019s no choice, but it\u2019s not a good problem to give up if you don\u2019t have a choice. So I\u2019m going to start by asking people for their opinions. I want a frank opinion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that simple. Try to behave like a royal.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m that mindless as a royal?\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been asking. The royal family must not bow their heads to their subordinates at all costs. And in order not to bow your head, you must always show your attitude as a norm.\u201d\u201cThis is tough\u201dIs it always right and normative? Um, in that respect, I\u2019m having a hard time overriding my valuation because of my previous liabilities. No, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201cWhat can I do if something happens that I have to keep my head down? Still, I am royal. How am I supposed to take responsibility?\u201cIt\u2019s still about acting royal. If you do it right, your grievances will disappear with dew.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m not going to make up with Yuffi now?\u201c\u2026 and this is a different matter. If my sister returns to the Duke\u2019s house, I can be reassured.\u201d\u201cHe said he was against keeping it beside me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Caind\u201dAs Yufi tries to get himself out again, he pushes his hand in front of him. No, he said he\u2019s scared of intimidation even though he\u2019s not really staring at himself, Yufi.And Caindo-kun, who is strengthening the pressure of losing and gazing, is amazing. Um, I wonder what\u2019s wrong with this.\u201cIt was the rust that came out of me that caused my distrust of the royal family. I can\u2019t trust you right now, and even if you tell me to get results, it won\u2019t make any noise\u2026. Still, I\u2019m not going to let Yufi go\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dWhoa, killer! My neighbor, Yuffi, was up for a moment. This isn\u2019t an exaggeration to say hatred, but you mean you care about Yufi so much. Um, I still have an even more headache.But for a moment, I\u2019ve had my doubts. Caindo-kun has not shown the key.\u201cFirst, what do you do when Uffi returns to the Duke\u2019s house?\u201cWhat do we do, what?\u201cIt\u2019s Yuffi\u2019s honor. Returning to the Duke\u2019s house will not erase the fact of the divorce. And I can\u2019t tell you that Uffi didn\u2019t have a problem telling me how bad Al was.\u201d\u201cYou think there\u2019s something wrong with my sister?\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the royals who stained my sister!!\u201dMomentum pounds his fist on his desk and Caindo-kun reveals his anger. The look is stained with anger and stares strongly at me.I look back at Kaindo-kun, feeling his head getting cold with a word of Kaindo-kun on the contrary.\u201cProblems arise because of each other. The weight of responsibility is not equal, but it\u2019s not like Uffi is any worse. It\u2019s the royal family who\u2019s been stained.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201cYou said it yourself. He said he couldn\u2019t save Al\u2019s mind. Yufi was perfect both as a duke and next queen. But its perfectly hush-hushed and unable to develop its sensibilities or relationships as a pivotal partner. That\u2019s Yuffi\u2019s fault.\u201dBut if he was asked to be a duke and queen, he had nothing to do with Yufi. But it was in Uffi\u2019s lack of walking and thinking that he was not likely to be next door, and it was a clear Uffi lapse that he was not able to develop enough relationships.Of course, Al is the one who didn\u2019t pack the distance, so it\u2019s both bad. Some of this is all about people\u2019s compatibility. Speaking of bad, Al is overwhelmingly worse, but it\u2019s impossible for Yufi to be told like the victim alone.\u201cThen Prince Algard says what a dissatisfaction he had with his sister!\u201cThat\u2019s not Yufi\u2019s fault\u2026\u2026 it was too perfect. It was painful to be next door.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2026! Isn\u2019t it bad Prince Algard who couldn\u2019t drink his own shame and couldn\u2019t make it right! Is that how the royal behaves!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you got scrapped. Now I\u2019m the next king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you called me Princess Odd Heavenly? When you bury what\u2019s missing from it on your sister, you say so?\u201cThat\u2019s right. For this reason, we have also prepared a new status for Ufi. All of them got their achievements loaded and made it a beacon of honor restoration. This was decided by Father and Lord Grants. To be clear, I\u2019m not going to pinch your grievances. But then your heart will not be saved. I can\u2019t repeat the same mistakes I made when I was Al.\u201dBecause I have no choice. That\u2019s the right thing to swallow. And you have to be patient. Life is such a pile of things. There\u2019s something I really need to swallow.If you can still save it. I don\u2019t want to abandon you if you can reach this. Even more so if you say that\u2019s who you want to reach out to.\u201cSaving\u2026! What do you know about me!? All I could do was see my beloved sister swung at the royal convenience and her honour and heart broken! Say what you know!!\u201dCaindo-kun finally takes his seat and shouts. No one could do anything about this problem. We all had equal hang-ups and lost sight of the opportunity.Who\u2019s worse, everyone\u2019s worse. It got up by that little pile. But that\u2019s why I can\u2019t just mourn and move on. We have to move on.\u201cYour dissatisfaction will be there after all. Whether we, the royal family, will not hurt Yufi again. I can\u2019t wipe my distrust because I can\u2019t take that certainty. Fine, then. Okay, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re convinced, but let me make a suggestion.\u201d\u201cSuggestion\u2026?\u201cTry me. In a way that you are convinced. Whatever you want, you just have to see if you deserve me as the next king and see if I can get enough to keep Yuffi.\u201dI also take my seat and approach Kaindo-kun. Pack the distance and stare back at his gaze from the top.\u201cIt\u2019s just that. This is the last time I can give in, too. If you don\u2019t even try me and just say you\u2019re not convinced\u2026 I\u2019ll have Uffi cut the edge with the Duke of Magenta\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026 heh!?\u201d\u201cUffi is my loyal minister. If you can\u2019t trust me, I can\u2019t trust you either. [M]\u2026 If that sounds later I\u2019ll trump the Duke of Magenta house. What matters to me is Uffi, not the Duke of Magenta.\u201dIf Uffi bothers between me and the house, cut off Uffi and the Duke of Magenta house with my hands. I told him when I was ready for it.Mrs. Nerschel, who sighed, uttered words as Kaindo-kun ceased to say and lost them.\u201c\u2026 that won\u2019t do either.\u201d\u201cMother!?\u201d\u201cCaind, you are the next Duke of Magenta. If you are not willing to offer your loyalty, advise yourself. Know that if you cannot do so, you will not gain the trust of the royal family. We serve only. The Duke will not be responsible for those who fail to make good the Lord\u2019s mistakes.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 my sister said I\u2019d cut off the edge of the house, etc! If you say I can\u2019t, why don\u2019t my sister inherit! Cut off the edge, etc., and no!\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is wrong with you. Besides, Yuffi was supposed to marry the royal family. It just slightly changes its shape. Besides, it would be difficult to succeed the wounded Uffi. It\u2019s a prerequisite for taking a son-in-law\u2026. and Yufi would also take Princess Anisphere if it were our home and Princess Anisphere?\u201cOf course it is. \u2026 even if you can no longer call your mother my mother\u201dTo Mrs Nerschel\u2019s inquiry, Uffi quietly returns her words. Kaindo-kun takes a step back to Yufi\u2019s response and steps back.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 Caind. If you are not worthy here, the Duke of Magenta will close its history.\u201d\u201cNah\u2026!?\u201d\u201cIn the times to come, the way the country is going to change dramatically. That is definitely what Princess Anisphere has earned the right to inherit the first throne. If you can\u2019t keep up with the course of that era, I was wondering if it\u2019s also up to parents to say no before they push you away.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you thinking the same thing Father and Father\u2026! Forgive me for that!\u201cI just want you to stay strong. You just have to be worthy of being the next Duke\u2019s owner. Isn\u2019t that the same thing you asked Princess Anisphere to behave as a royal?Mrs. Nerschel overlaps her words toward Kaindo-kun in a sharp blade-like tone.\u201cCome on, sister, go away. Yuffi\u2019s future is up to you, and yours is up to you. Until now, I thought about Uffi standing as queen and raised him as loyal as possible\u2026 but things have changed.\u201d\u201cMother\u2026!\u201cSweetness is unacceptable. Look at reality, take it, think. We\u2019ve given you as much education as we can think of. If that\u2019s still not enough, it\u2019s nothing more than a disgrace to our house. Let me spoil and accept that immorality with you.\u201dIf Mrs. Nerschel says it all, Kaindo-kun chewed her lips and silenced her.After seeing Kaindo-kun, who has been silent, Mrs. Nerschel turns her gaze.\u201cPrincess Anisphere, may I have some more time? I\u2019m going to discuss it with my son, too. And Grants, of course.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t mind waiting. I just can\u2019t get a long reprieve.\u201d\u201cYep. If you seem to be so obstinate\u2026 Uffi, I\u2019ll leave the decision to you.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern, Mother.\u201dUffi bows his head deeply to Mrs Nerschel\u2019s words.\u2026 In the end, the air of talking about it also disappeared, so I left the matter of Kaindo-kun to Mrs Nerschel and we decided to go back to the outhouse.On the way back to the outhouse. I was blurry as the carriage that got me out of the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house rocked me. Uffi, sitting face-to-face, was also looking out in the sky somewhere above.The sky is the color of the sunset. The side of Uffi lit by the sunset was somewhere full of worry and looked very lonely.\u201c\u2026 Ufi, I\u2019m sorry\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 take the liberty of talking about isolation, bring it up\u201d\u201cNo. I think it was necessary\u2026. Talk to me again and I get it. Cain\u2019s heart swore allegiance to me, not to the royal family.\u201dYufi says as he lays his eyes down. That looks so careless. It does seem to me that Kaindo-kun was loyal to Ufi individuals. But that might not help either. He said he had been educated since he was a child when he saw Uffi as queen.Maybe if Uffi could have been queen, there would have been no problem. But it didn\u2019t. When this happens, the feeling of admiring Kaindo-kun\u2019s Yufi becomes excessive.\u201c\u2026 you remind me how indifferent I was to the eyes from others\u201d\u201cUfi?\u201d\u201cAs required, just if perfect. I\u2019ve believed that to be right. But I just wish I could have realized how Algard and Cain felt. If it\u2019s even Caind, how did Algard feel about his surrounding eyes\u2026 so he\u2019s not careless.\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you regret that loyalty was directed at Uffi personally and not actually to the royal family?\u201c\u2026 Yes. I didn\u2019t really understand Algard\u2019s suffering, but I noticed a little bit when I saw Caind. Even though it is Master Algard who should be king, that has made me scorn the royal family. I guess it\u2019s not just Cain, those who looked at me like that.\u201d\u2026 I can\u2019t deny that.Yufi was perfect for better or worse. So I think Al-Kun\u2019s mediocrity, arranged next to it, stood out. That\u2019s why I put Uffi on top mainly, not Al-Kun. I can\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t anyone like that.If I do find myself in such an environment, I can\u2019t help but distort it if I realize it. I think Al might have noticed. That\u2019s why I thought so much of it, and things happened.\u201cEven now, I\u2019m afraid of myself\u2026. Master Anis is amazing. I can\u2019t believe you understand your dangers. I didn\u2019t understand anything about me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I guess I can\u2019t even be told that I noticed. Surprisingly, I don\u2019t know who I am.\u201dSome environmental differences, others you won\u2019t notice without a hang-up. Besides, I\u2019m supposed to be an adult in this world, but Uffi is 15 years old, and I think it\u2019s hard to tell him to understand himself in 15 years.Yufi was right to be able to behave as he wished in the given environment. But it\u2019s not all gonna work out because you\u2019re right. The world is always muddled.\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, will you give up being king?\u201c\u2026 No way. Instead, I thought it would be better if I became king.\u201d\u201cSome people might see Yufi as sacred, like Caindo-kun, right?\u201cLet\u2019s leave that to people, it was sweet. So now I want to carry it all myself. If a powerful man wants a qualified man\u2026 I will bear it.\u201dI can\u2019t see the color of stray in Yuffi\u2019s eyes. I think he\u2019s a really strong kid\u2026. so I can also be king. I\u2019m sure I can be a more legitimate king than I am. But it\u2019s not just my hobby to let you carry it.Standing up with his hips floating, he sits straight next to Uffi and moves his seat. I pull Yuffi\u2019s shoulder trying to watch out for me as I move my seat and knock Yuffi down so he can put his head on his own lap.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis, it\u2019s dangerous\u201d\u201cUffi, be sweeter to me. It\u2019s good to try, but if it\u2019s hard, you can say it\u2019s hard, and if it\u2019s painful, you can say it\u2019s painful. I may not be able to show my true self. But just stop faking it to me.\u201dBecause if not, it\u2019s not a way of life, it\u2019s a creature. Yufi is really going to be that way and it\u2019s dangerous. If you tell me, I\u2019ll do as they tell me, and I\u2019ll be alone as I am.They told me I couldn\u2019t, so if Yufi\u2019s going to be alone, he needs to stop even if he grabs the root. Yufi laughs like trouble at my words and whines small as I hide that eye area with one hand.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201c\u2026 what people expect is heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you notice the weight, you\u2019re a proper human being. Good for you, Uffi.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you even look like you didn\u2019t float? Raini called me to worry, and I was supposed to make tea because I was on vacation.Ilia said she has a face in the royal palace, and here are three of us: me, Yufi and Raini. The tea Raini brewed for me seems to have gained quite a bit of skill and I feel it improve every day. That makes me kind of happy and relaxed.\u201cSo you and your brother couldn\u2019t make up?\u201d\u201cI wonder if it will. I don\u2019t know what to say about being so stubborn\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t even know how you feel about Caindo, but it\u2019s not good. Even though it is still pre-adult, I can\u2019t put it aside as my subordinate that the next Duke\u2019s lord remains that way.I haven\u2019t been out of the palace very long, so I\u2019ve been wondering the other way around, isn\u2019t there a lot of people who stop thinking on assumptions? Navre, the Earl of Sprout family, had that tendency.I thought Navru-kun had the effect of attracting Raini. Could that be the case overall\u2026?I don\u2019t want to think the whole country is, but I feel like these things happen a lot, especially when I face to face with a kid who recently attended an aristocratic college. I suspect that overlapping like this is also legal. Then the common denominator is that I went to college\u2026\u201c\u2026 what kind of education do you educate about aristocratic colleges?\u201cYes? What is it all of a sudden, Master Anis?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t go to college, so what class did I take?\u201d\u201cEspecially weird. History classes, magic classes, manners as a nobleman, and then self-study for papers.\u201d\u2026\u2026 yeah. It\u2019s normal to just ask about the item Yufi gave you, isn\u2019t it?\u201cFor example, learn about magic and faith in the Spirit in the content of a class?\u201cOh, there was. I was unfamiliar and struggled\u2026\u201dRaini groans with a bitter face. Is there one after all? I think the Ministry of Magic is probably leading the way, but I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about it.Uffi, on the other hand, had his eyes round and his neck tilted at Raini\u2019s answer.\u201cNot familiar, is it?\u201cBecause I am originally a civilian. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have faith in the Spirit, but I perceived it a little differently from the nobles, so I struggled with it\u2026\u201d\u201cAre there so many different perceptions of faith between nobles and civilians?\u201cI don\u2019t think the doctrine itself will change much. That\u2019s right\u2026 the distance between the spirits is different between civilians and nobles, Yufi.\u201d\u201cIs it a sense of distance?\u201cOh, I think Master Anis would describe it right. Spirits are also thankful beings to civilians. But I don\u2019t know what to say about not being more enthusiastic than all the nobles. There\u2019s a distance, and I think the expression stays the same.\u201dYuffi frowns as he suffers from understanding. This is because I, too, have faith in the Spirit, but I don\u2019t have as much faith in it as the average aristocrat, so I know what Raini\u2019s feeling is.The daughter of a rooted nobleman, that may also be a difficult story to empathize with Ufi, who was raised as a Duke\u2019s Lady.\u201cCivilians don\u2019t benefit directly from magic. That\u2019s not why magical aptitude and precision can be seen as foiling. I mean, it\u2019s not something to be appreciated, so you can call it indifference.\u201d\u201cIs that the sense of distance\u2026\u2026? But the doctrine itself is together, isn\u2019t it?\u201cThe weight of gratitude is different between those who are directly beneficial and those who are not. Spirits are thankful things to civilians. Magic is a miracle given by the Spirit, not so much the great power that nobility possesses, what is it?\u201d\u201cAwesome power\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. So even if I can use magic, I\u2019m worse than the others because I don\u2019t have enough faith, and so on, and a lot of anger. This is why the civilian ascent, or something.\u201dRaini\u2019s eyes are gradually drifting. No, that would be a struggle. All of a sudden they say things with common sense they don\u2019t know. It may have been necessary, but it really was a failure to put Raini in the College of Nobility, wasn\u2019t it?Together, civilian spirits and magical beliefs are vague or fluffy compared to nobility. I know I\u2019m grateful, it actually benefits me too. However, it is not ourselves, but the nobles, so the feeling of other personnel is close.\u201cTo give a plain example, from a civilian point of view, spiritual stones are\u201d money. \u201c\u201c\u2026 money?\u201cAhhh! I know! Finding a little big spiritual stone or something is going to be money! I used to look for you when your mother was alive. Because it\u2019s going to be a road bank.\u201dAll Yufi says is that he heard an unexpected word, and Raini answers with a loud nod as to whether he sympathized or not.\u201cBut from the aristocracy, if you see the Spirit Stone, it will be money! You don\u2019t think, do you?\u201cUh, yeah. It\u2019s a gift from the Spirit, and\u2026 are you so different in your perception?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201dThe difference in perceptions between civilians and nobles is significant. One factor is the presence or absence of magic and distance from the Spirit.For civilians, nobility is a miracle that can be used. It can also be described as a monstrous opponent who suffers harm if they undermine their mood with a respectable existence that guarantees their lives.I should be a protector of civilians to nobility, but some of them are bad people who don\u2019t think civilians are like the same people to benefit. There are few such aristocratic tyranny and there is also a history of deepening the gulf between aristocracy and civilians separated by differences in perception.Of course, there are as many respected nobles to the civilians. But bad impressions are hard to get rid of once they take root. And the emotions I find horrible are troublesome. I get distanced so that I can say I don\u2019t sneak up on a god I don\u2019t touch. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that leads to further grooves.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing to have a distance between civilians and nobles. If the identity difference is clear and the role to be played is different. So I hope it turns out well\u2026\u2026 the Palettia Kingdom has a long history. There are more bastards of nobility, and I think there are potentially magical children among the civilian population.\u201d\u201cI mean, you think a lot of kids are putting talent to sleep?\u201cI wish I stayed asleep. There are many problems that arise when magic becomes available with some kind of cut. It doesn\u2019t have to be as big as Raini\u2019s case.\u201dWhen something without upbringing acquires great power, it may destroy itself without using its power correctly. It would be nice to just self-destruct, but I\u2019m afraid when it involves my surroundings and things go wrong.I don\u2019t mean to deny the history of the Kingdom of Palettia, which has separated aristocracy and civilians by differences in identity, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same thing to divert attention from the problems that can arise in reality.Though there is no way in the present system to give him the Baroness as a civilian ascendant nobleman or to welcome him to adoption. Now there are aristocrats whose blood inherits, but whose identities vary. It\u2019s not a bad thing to take care of tradition, but I want you to think about time and case.\u201cIt\u2019s not even a problem that\u2019s surfacing, so if you say I\u2019m too worried, that\u2019s it\u2026. Oh, you got a slight subject-matter shift from the point of view. Problem is, the aristocratic college\u2019s educational content.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, that was the story. For some reason it was a difference between the perception of the faith of the nobles and the civilians\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not irrelevant. Honestly, I\u2019ve always thought that noble values in this country were too close to religion. I suppose I can say I\u2019m adamant with tradition.\u201dIt\u2019s good to take care of it. But if you can\u2019t even change your mind from there, it doesn\u2019t taste good. It could be a system that can\u2019t cope with change. That\u2019s what I fear.The world changes with the course of time all the time. I\u2019ve never been stable in a long time, but I always have to be prepared for something. No, it\u2019s causing something unprecedented. I would if you told me not to.But honestly, I don\u2019t care how many companions you tell me to choose when I think of the sons of nobles my age I\u2019ve ever known.\u201cIt also leads to problems with materials stored in the Ministry of Magic, doesn\u2019t it? Emphasis on tradition and faith. Not really. He said there are verses that leave real problems behind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to know about past success experiences. But the reality is that it doesn\u2019t just solve it, it means we\u2019re going to live. I have to be ready at all times. For example, if I hadn\u2019t had Raini\u2019s problem, it would have tasted pretty bad, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 If Master Anis hadn\u2019t noticed, what would have happened to me?\u201dWithout me Raini wouldn\u2019t have been noticed to be a vampire, and there is a great chance he would have unconsciously knocked the country down into chaos. It is possible that the Kingdom of Palletia was placed under Raini\u2019s brainwashing because it was used by Alkun even if he did not want it.Well, bringing Raini up with an example is too special a case\u2026. Looking back, all the unusual things are happening, right? I\u2019m one of them.\u201cHonor, wisdom, mystery, tradition that has been inherited. Nothing. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not worth it, either. But that\u2019s not absolute.\u201dOtherwise, you can\u2019t use magic. They might say I\u2019m worthless. Until now, I don\u2019t care what they say from around me, but I can\u2019t say that anymore. I must make my worth known to my surroundings.In order to do this, we have to overturn our current values. You have to gain understanding and support. There is also the catch. But there is a dispute about what is wrong with the values that are at odds. And that dispute could involve the country.But I have to change it. I feel that the sense of crisis that I have long felt distracted has been visualized. This was in a cage, too. It\u2019s a bad effect. I can\u2019t grasp the trend of aristocracy of my age at all.\u201cI also need to find out about the Spirit Contract, but I need to make allies in parallel\u2026 even if I can persuade them to suppress it, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll pull their legs if they get disgusted.\u201d\u201cLady Anis doesn\u2019t have many aristocrats to say she\u2019s on her side\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems like Father, Mother, Lord Grants, Mrs. Nerschel, and the Sprout Knights Commander\u2026 yeah, no\u201dI finished counting with one hand. My side is too much now. I don\u2019t even have a handout to make allies with. It was a problem I was staining myself with, but I think the sense of crisis came late. I didn\u2019t think faith in magic and spirits and adherence to tradition would pull my legs so far.You can\u2019t deny it at all when they say that Yufi would be more stable to be king. I wonder what\u2019s wrong with it. When this happens, I seriously feel like I\u2019m running out of options to lay down a dictatorship. That\u2019s why this is a last resort.\u201c\u2026 does Yufi seem to be listening to me to his alumni or something?\u201c\u2026 sorry\u201dI\u2019m sorry, I heard. Don\u2019t drop your shoulder because I\u2019m sorry.\u201c\u2026 Raini\u201d\u201c\u2026 me, a friend or something, hey\u201dI\u2019m sorry, I heard. Don\u2019t be depressed because I was stupid.\u2026 Oh no? Looking back at our relationship again, it doesn\u2019t suck!? This doesn\u2019t suck!? There are vertical connections, but there aren\u2019t any horizontal connections!?I heard footsteps there. If the door opens, Ilaria comes in dressed for going out.\u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re back now.\u201d\u201cIlia!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201cIlia has many friends!?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s all of a sudden\u201dHe looked at us like he was scared, but he told us he had too many friends to make allies.Ilia then sighed even more frightened. Ilia shrugs like she\u2019s terribly tired as she rubs the wrinkles between her eyebrows.\u201c\u2026 what are you talking about now\u201d\u201cI think so too\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you were placing a dictatorship or something in fancy language?\u201cYeah, but if you do your past self a little bit, you\u2019re gonna want to go knock it down, so let\u2019s stop it? No, seriously, I\u2019m a bit more anxious about the aristocracy of my age than the quality of the students at the College of Aristocracy thought\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. It was a blind spot for me, too.\u201dWe were basically pulling cages. There were also difficulties in obtaining information due to the fact that the College of Nobility was special and closed.Or is it really okay? You\u2019re inviting international students from other countries, right? That makes me anxious, but it\u2019s my mother\u2019s jurisdiction around diplomacy\u2026. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201cSo do I have any friends?\u2026 Think I\u2019m here?\u201cLet\u2019s not? Let\u2019s not reopen that, shall we? We\u2019re gonna make a sad alliance here, aren\u2019t we?Ilia ran out with a full smile! I\u2019m not proud of you!?What the hell, this sad alliance! You\u2019re so sad! No, I\u2019m not in trouble! I like being alone! Don\u2019t pull me off!\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to make friends.\u201d\u201cNo, I am\u2026\u201d\u201cNot that I can\u2019t think of a way, but you should talk to your majesty and queen first.\u201d\u201cIs there any good way?\u201cIt\u2019s royal, and the tea party should be led by Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ooh!That was a blind spot! A tea party I lead! Speaking of which, I didn\u2019t have the idea of opening it myself because they called me and I didn\u2019t like it. If we were to make connections between nobles, we\u2019d meet for tea. That was a classic means!\u201cI just don\u2019t have a handover for Master Anisphere himself, so who do we call and what do we do with the scale? That should be decided in consultation with Your Majesty and the Queen.\u201d\u201cUm, yeah. I want to tell you about the spiritual contract investigation, and can you get me an appointment? I\u2019m sorry for coming back so soon.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201dIlia will thank you and leave the room behind again. I sighed too, dropping it off.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s really not even a favor now.\u201d\u201cYes, I know, so please don\u2019t poke me with those words.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been running around, take it spoiled.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry\u201dAs always, Father and Mother\u2019s footwork is light. The night Ilia contacted me, I got some time. I want to think that\u2019s all you\u2019re worried about. So I also have to spoil and take what they say about Gucci like a sermon\u2026. you don\u2019t like it!This time I am away from the palace and watching everyone in the palace with my father and mother. Father sighed as he rubbed loose between his eyebrows to avoid hiding his tiredness.\u201cAs for the investigation of the spiritual covenant, yes. Okay. Is progress tough? You were right to say no to Lord Jiltu\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to get your hands on the reorganization of the Ministry of Magic?\u201c\u2026 you\u2019ll have to. For your generation, too. I felt a lot of concern. But it\u2019s also true that the rest of the position is difficult.\u201dFather groans with a bitter, bitter look. My mother also looks difficult next door.\u201c\u2026 because even your father and mother couldn\u2019t make it out strong to the Ministry of Magic?\u201cAs a country, I had to, rightly so. It took coordination with the Ministry of Magic to bring the country together for the rest of the generation\u2026\u201d\u201cIf we got our hands on the Ministry badly, we could have gotten backlash\u2026 and then we could have cracked the country.\u201dYou\u2019re too much trouble, Ministry of Magic. Though it is not a matter of pride to be a magically brilliant country, it is also dangerous to detain too much. What do you mean, threaten the kingdom?\u201cThe same goes for the rampage of the Chartreuse family, which was at the head, but there are still sins in failing to grasp the status quo. I tried to run for the stability of the country, but the rest seemed to be the king of all fools\u2026\u201d\u201cFather, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s dented. If you retire, I\u2019ll ask you in my name to research plants and improve varieties, so just a few more steps.\u201d\u201cYou, why did you do that?\u2026 No, good. If you say so, you\u2019ll have to be very uptight.\u201dMy father looked at me as surprised, but he quickly regained his mind and made me laugh. You can\u2019t have it crushed yet. At least I need your father to stay healthy until me and Uffi inherit it it.\u201cSpeaking of which, is it going to come true to meet the Spirit Contractor?\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for a reply. Remote and secluded, it will take time for the sentence to return.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is it remote?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not like you again, but I\u2019m separated from you. Wait a while.\u201d\u201cThen again, is it more constructive to focus on consolidating the ground around us?\u201d\u201cSo tea party.\u201dYeah, we finally got back to talking. My mother is putting her hand on her chin with a strange face.\u201cI think it would be a good idea to have a tea party. In the first place, you don\u2019t have any side connections. The question is who to call\u2026\u201d\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d like to invite Baron Cyan.\u201d\u201cHuh? Get your father?I blinked my eyes like Raini said it was my first ear. I didn\u2019t say either.\u201cIn the future, if you want to spread your magic props, you had an idea to ask Baron Cyan to be the tester for your magic props. Mana Blade also saw the form of the development system in my Celestial and Uffi arcane shell. I\u2019d like to hear from the former adventurer\u2019s point of view.\u201d\u201cHa, I see\u201d\u201cBut if you speak too much to a less stately nobleman, you\u2019re going to get backlash too\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to invite Raini because he\u2019s still here. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know.\u201cMy impression is that as you become a senior aristocrat, you feel like you\u2019re breathing in the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t deny it.\u201dMy mother squeaks as she narrows her eyes. I knew it. Though it was a matter of concern because I also heard about the fact that he was chewing heavily on the education of the Aristocratic College.\u201cOf course, we weren\u2019t left alone by the Ministry of Magic with cold talent, but it was the best we could do with good offices to the Knights everywhere, or soliciting them to my mission.\u201d\u201cWere you so powerful in the Ministry of Magic?\u201cRegardless, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s better than royalty. But when they hold the thought and the faith\u2026 Sometimes being too prestigious and crossing spears makes me suspicious, and it\u2019s true that I avoided it.\u201d\u201cIn that respect, you\u2019ve been the good one so far. If I blamed you, I wouldn\u2019t have made a difference from the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cThat!? I was being shielded!?\u201dThe strong hit on me by the Ministry of Magic was possibly something like that!? No, I was noticeable too. Father also showed an attitude that he was in tune with the Ministry of Magic by tightening it up, regardless of the bottom of his belly.\u201cStill moving politics. Many of the nobles have had the breath of the Ministry of Magic?\u201cI\u2019m letting antagonism. Grants is making good adjustments to that\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 that you could do it if you tried to smash it?\u201cIf you want to lay down a dictatorship,\u201d\u201cMe and Grants will follow your majesty. There may be a lot of blood, but make sure you give up your victory.\u201dWhat\u2019s scary about it? It\u2019s a nightmare at a time when they say you\u2019re still the strongest mother and Lord Grants said you were as strong as your mother before you left the line.\u201c\u2026 the rest didn\u2019t make it any better. He said that there was less blood to shed and that he should drink the rest of the mud. Now I wonder if that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a good king, and I think I\u2019m a proud father. I\u2019m not good at it. I\u2019m good at surviving rough waves, but not at quenching rough waves.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s uncomfortable when you say something decent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not terrible!?\u201dTruth is, your father still has a cluttered perception of me! I don\u2019t care!\u201cTaken together, does the force map mean that we\u2019re splitting up between the Kings and the Ministry of Magic?\u201cThere are some neutrals out there, but if we split them up as a faction, we will.\u201d\u201cSo, in terms of force, the Kings win, but in terms of political influence, the Ministry of Magic wins. If you want to do it, you can suppress it, but then the blood will flow and you will have trouble processing it?\u201cUhm\u2026 Magic minister, huh. That\u2019s what I call it. He understands that. That is why it is possible that he was caught up in the future seizure of hegemony with ideological guidance, etc. It was the College of Aristocrats that was heavily affected by it\u2026 but as you know, it\u2019s close to a closed environment, hard to get information to your ears.\u201dMm-hmm. I can see the schematics, mostly, but now what?When that happens, I should be a nobleman without the breath of the Ministry of Magic, but given the influence of politics, I can\u2019t even say that.\u201cI intend to have raised my successor, too. You\u2019re still anxious in terms of numbers\u2026\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 then again, let\u2019s start there\u201d\u201c? Over there?\u201cIt\u2019s not white or black. There is a house of nobility to be called the head of the neutrals\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you a graphite family?Yufi, who had been silent until now, visited him in a quiet voice. Father and mother gaze at Uffi and nod at each other with a full smile after a little surprise.The Graphite family is the home of Jiltu\u2019s grandfather, who is now acting head of the Ministry of Magic?\u201cYufi\u2019s getting more reliable these days.\u201d\u201cYeah, really.\u201d\u201cThe Graphite family is Jiltu\u2019s grandfather\u2019s home, isn\u2019t it?\u201cRight. For more information\u2026 Was it Miguel, the next owner? You should hear it from him. That\u2019s what it takes to earn the loyalty of that house.\u201dThose grassless people headed the Neutralists? I\u2019m a little bit uncomfortable with it, hmm. Then why don\u2019t we meet?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47: 47Later, when I talked to my father and mother, Yuffi put out the invitation sentence to Miguel. I was just a little surprised that she had been asked to contact me for a long time. Uffi\u2019s moving, too, I don\u2019t know.The reply from that Miguel arrived earlier than I thought. When I read the contents, I accidentally looked delicate in terms of the invitation of the flowers and the desire to ask you even immediately. However, I decided to hold a tea party the next day, as I had never been there to see her before.The designated location is the corner of the outhouse garden. The tea Ilia prepared for me and the treats Raini made for me, ready to go. Later we just wait for Miguel to come.\u201cDear Anisphere, We have brought the Marquis Graphite son.\u201d\u201cHa, Lord Ilia. You can call me Miguel, right?Miguel, who has been guided by Ilia, says lightly with a seemingly good grin of people. Ilia\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t even move, and she takes a step back with a gentle glance as it is.Miguel doesn\u2019t look like he cared about how Ilia looked like that, and he turns to me. I give Miguel my hand and ask him to shake it.\u201cThank you for responding to our sudden invitation.\u201d\u201cNo! This was also convenient because I had an appointment with Miss Uphilia. Oh, of course I was looking forward to a moment with Princess Anisphere, too!\u201cWell, you\u2019re good\u201dIf I finish shaking hands and step back, Uffi will step forward to take his place. Yuffi\u2019s hand holds a handkerchief and offers it straight to Miguel. Miguel takes the handkerchief offered by Uffi with respect and goes straight to his nostalgia.\u201cYou did make good on your promise. It\u2019s a pleasure to see you again, Master Ufilia.\u201d\u201cYeah, I wanted to see you, too. Lord Miguel.\u201dIf we laugh at each other, we\u2019ll stay seated. Ilia and Raini are asked to refrain from doing so at a short distance. Uffi next to me, Miguel sits face-to-face.\u201cHey, the tea treats here are great!\u201cBecause it\u2019s one of my proud squire\u2019s dishes. If you were indulgent, most importantly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also jealous that we have this kind of tea treat available exclusively!Miguel consumes one treat after another. That\u2019s something I can eat a lot, I stare at.Exhale with tea as you go, and Miguel looks at this one with a smiling grin. The atmosphere I felt before that I couldn\u2019t grasp was alive\u2026. Well, what shall I do?You don\u2019t like working with this kind of hand. Then I guess it would be a bad idea to behave strangely. Let\u2019s attack like ourselves from here on out.\u201c\u2026 well. Then I\u2019ll let you go vegan from here. Honestly, I\u2019m not going to go around or anything. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re here for a noble tea party.\u201d\u201cHo? And say what?\u201cI want to know if you\u2019re someone I can get along with. It\u2019s a hard atmosphere to grasp. I want to know if I can trust you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite frank.\u201dMiguel\u2019s smile remains the same. Nico and I feel those eyes look at me with interest. Show me a smile so I can respond, too.\u201cI\u2019d like a candid opinion from Miguel, too. If you were to bet on me, how far would you bet?\u201cIs that a bet?\u201cYes. How much future do you keep with me?\u201cThat, of course. As his subordinate, he became Princess Anisphere\u2019s hand, his leg\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to hear Miguel\u2019s feelings, not as a Graphite family position.\u201dI say to block Miguel\u2019s words. So Miguel shook his expression just a little bit. The main thing that has changed is the eyes. The intriguing eye color looks deeper. Look back at me like that. I wait for Miguel\u2019s next word.\u201c\u2026 you really don\u2019t look like a nobleman rather than a royal, the princess. No, I don\u2019t hate it, though, do I? I\u2019d rather. You know, dating a nobleman can be a tough thing to do.\u201dMiguel laughs when he breaks his posture and attitude at the same time. The vegetarian expression looked like a prank kid, and to be honest, it seemed like I had finally seen a side that seemed to favor me.I get my feet together under the dress to go with it, too. I feel Ilia narrowed her eyes when I found her for a purpose, but dare ignore her and put a cheek wand on her desk.\u201cOh, nice. Hey, I\u2019ve always felt like I could get along with the princess, you know, me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say it often. Isn\u2019t that a pose, too?\u201cWell, how about that?\u201cWell, good. So, what do you say? How much value have you personally found in me?\u201cIs he still on his way? No, if it\u2019s worth it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to give loyalty to a princess, do I? It\u2019s going to show you a different and exciting form of governance than His Majesty Orphans.\u201dExciting governance. Well, it\u2019s exciting in the sense that you might just make and go about things you haven\u2019t seen before. It is inevitable to spread magic, and I will not deny it.\u201cSo? Because what does the princess want from me?\u201cI want you to be on my side, but I\u2019m not telling you to be. I want you to give me information instead.\u201d\u201cInformative?\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re the queen of freaks. Who will be on your side and who will be enemies with the bumps you\u2019ve neglected before? I don\u2019t have the information to identify it.\u201d\u201cI see?\u201d\u201cSo, I wanted to connect with you who seemed to have information. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d\u201cHmm?Miguel hammering for fun. I look into Miguel\u2019s eyes so he doesn\u2019t change his expression in particular.Well, I don\u2019t know how to get out. I think he showed me some vegetables, but I don\u2019t see the bottom at all.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo, what?\u201cIs it in my interest? Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So what do you want?\u201cCan I snort when I say the King\u2019s throne?I ran chills on my spine and my cheeks were about to cramp unexpectedly. No, I know you\u2019re obviously joking, but I got a rejection reflexively.Then an evil sign drifted from Ufi, who was sitting next to him. Even colder chills run and breathe like coughing. Miguel\u2019s laughing oddly when I\u2019m breathing. Konnya.\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m talking to a boulder.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s a funny joke\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this. What I want, hey. Then I want you to tell me about magic.\u201d\u201cAbout magic?\u201cThat\u2019s an idea that doesn\u2019t exist. What the hell do I perceive to produce such a thing? And I found a new theory where no one came looking at me. I admit it\u2019s too much of a rush to accept in this country, but I won\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019d appreciate it if you could appreciate that much.\u201d\u201cI would also rate it. Honestly, I\u2019m glad the princess has a royal bondage.\u201dMiguel narrowed his eyes and switched the emotions that were floating in the color of those eyes. I can\u2019t feel the heat of my emotions, just eyes to observe.\u201cI\u2019m scared. Imagine when the princess disappeared from this country.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why is that?\u201cThe foundation of the Kingdom of Palletia is heavily occupied by the Spirit. There are plenty of resources for spiritual relations as a national characteristic. For example, if a princess travels to another country to enlighten magic, everyone will find value in spiritual resources. Then I need to take the Kingdom of Palletia. Your magic might have stripped your fangs. If a princess is to leave this country alone and take over a\u201d named \u201cdemon, even more so, magic can be used even if she is not a nobleman. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that I would work with another country to destroy this country?\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to have such a future, is it? In fact, the princess\u2019s position was low. Even now, around the Ministry of Magic, the princess is reluctant to be king.\u201dThat\u2019s an impossible imagination of the future. I think so, but I can\u2019t deny that it looks that way from the side. In fact, when Al Kun became king, he thought of leaving this country as one option.If they think I hate this country. And if you look to the kingdom of Palletia, which is rich in resources to use magic. Maybe I\u2019ll join forces with other countries to start a war. That seems\u2026 a little undeniable.It wouldn\u2019t have been strange if I had been a national bandit if I had misaligned myself with one thing. Objectively, I don\u2019t deny it.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to deny it. You don\u2019t think about what happens when a human being as capable of acting as a princess abandons his country?\u201cI also think about leaving if you tell me to leave. I won\u2019t do it because it\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d\u201cScary. Scary. Truth is, the king and his wife are good parents now. His Majesty was conservative in some places, but not foolish. Well, I\u2019ve been too cautious to allow the rise of the Ministry of Magic until now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What is the Graphite family\u2019s position?That\u2019s where I\u2019ve always been concerned. The Graphites don\u2019t really know what kind of house it is. Miguel deepens his mouth grin funny to my inquiry.\u201cDo you want to hear that? Well, it\u2019s neutral. I don\u2019t put my shoulder in either. Prioritize those who are in the national interest. That\u2019s the kind of stance I\u2019ve had since I was the head of the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cBut you left when you were a generation ago, didn\u2019t you?\u201cI heard it was because His Majesty bowed his head. He bowed his head to Grandpa, who was then the secretary and had penetrated his position of neutrality, and asked him to leave the seat of the secretary. To consolidate the country\u2019s policies, to unify the will of the nobles, who are thick in their magical faith, including the Chartreuse family.\u201dSo you\u2019re saying that at Father\u2019s request, the nobles who are organizing the present Ministry of Magic, starting with the Chartreuse family, have begun to have power? Originally, the Ministry of Magic was the secretary of the neutral Graphite family?\u201cBeside His Majesty was Lord Grants, who was good enough to have de as a wizard, and Queen Silphine. After the Graphites took a step back and gave way, they paced with the Ministry of Magic, put the country in turmoil and stabilized the reign in case of an external illness. That in itself is a feat, but it has created a soil for future seeds of discord in order to take stability.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t make sense for the country to remain rough\u201d\u201cEspecially you.\u201dAs a father, I guess it was a painful way to keep pace with the aristocrats whose magic beliefs are deeply ingrained. At the time, I asked people how rough the country was. He said he used a somewhat forceful hand to bring the country together quickly.I thought he was like a father and not like a father. That man is not really fit for contention. So even if we can stabilize it, the problems of the Ministry of Magic have deepened its roots. There is good and bad, but the king cannot speak only on that side.Maybe that\u2019s why the next generation of me was a wreck is also God\u2019s extraction, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201cWhat the Graphites want is the stability and prosperity of the nation. Anyone can do that. If the king is stupid, it\u2019s enough to put the king in perspective, isn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. It\u2019s good to hear that story. Relieved.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cMiguel. Don\u2019t you want to make an alliance with me?\u201cAlliance?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not so close to being comrades. What we give each other priority is stability and prosperity in the country. Then let\u2019s form an alliance with me. If it\u2019s in my interest, you just have to keep the alliance going. If I tilt the country, you can drag it down relentlessly.\u201dI tell Miguel as I slap him in the neck with my fingers. Although Miguel rounded his eyes for a moment, he immediately held his belly and laughed.\u201cHa ha! You can drag yourself down if it\u2019s not in the country\u2019s interest! Nice, nice, Princess! You\u2019re the best!\u201c\u2026 that much?\u201cYou don\u2019t get tired of watching a woman with that much temper. Uh, that\u2019s crazy. But you\u2019re really a parent and a child, and a princess.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThey also said His Majesty Orphans. If you need it to stabilize the country, drop this neck. Then Lord Grants and Queen Sylphine squeezed me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh, it\u2019s amazing\u201dIt was too easy to imagine a father whose mother was preaching and shrinking his shoulders under pressure from Lord Grants. But I\u2019m just a little relieved when people say they\u2019re similar. I\u2019m glad you think I\u2019m a proper daughter.I am royal even if I rot, and I grew up in this country. I don\u2019t hate this country, and I don\u2019t wish it was rough. That\u2019s why I thought I could swallow the pain or be king. I\u2019ve never been over it before, though.\u201cSo, alliance, alliance. You think it\u2019s okay to remain neutral?\u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t even tell you to be on my side. Let\u2019s keep our hands together while our interests match.\u201d\u201cFine. This is my personal covenant with the princess. The Graphites are, once and for all, sire by but neutral in their position. I\u2019m not going to change that position even if I take the lead. Is that all right with you?I nod and show. I\u2019m sure the loyalty of Zildu\u2019s grandfather and the present Marquis Graphite was dedicated to his father. Somehow I feel that way.So what I get is Miguel\u2019s trust and loyalty. When he doesn\u2019t get along with it, he could turn to my enemy. But I don\u2019t mind. Sometimes it\u2019s better to have a dry relationship.\u201cFrom today on, I\u2019m your ally. Say hello again, Princess Anisphere?\u201cThis is Miguel. I\u2019d like to ask you a quick favor.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYes, sir. Instead, give me good information on magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then. Raini!\u201dWhen I call Raini, Raini, who was waiting a short distance away, rushes up.\u201cAre you calling? Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cBring me one Mana Blade. Give it to Miguel.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because it\u2019s good?\u201cIt\u2019s an alliance. I\u2019ll take care of it, that\u2019s why.\u201dMana Blade hasn\u2019t used it as her primary weapon since I got the Celestial either. I may carry it as a protective weapon.Miguel might have something in the future. You might be able to guess your alliance with me. So I\u2019ll give it to you as protection when something happens. This is my sincerity.\u201cOh! Rumor has it you\u2019re a demon prop! Can I have one?\u201cYeah, definitely use it. But if you use it too much, you\u2019ll be suspicious of my relationship.\u201d\u201cOf course it is! So, again, you\u2019re asking for information?\u201cYep. All I want to hear is about the aristocracy that seems to take my side and the aristocracy that needs to be careful.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMiguel strokes his jaw to my question. Put your hand down while I stroke your chin.\u201cFirst, the Voltaire family. Looks like you\u2019re gathering support over there with the intention of delivering to Chartreuse\u2019s cauldron. Our Lord is also a Taka of Magic Faith. I\u2019m sure Lang, my son, knows, but he won\u2019t impress the princess very well.\u201d\u201cOh, I know that\u2019s a boulder.\u201d\u201cSo, he said he was turning up the heat on Miss Uphilia. He wants to welcome me to his wife in the future.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s gonna break it.\u201dI\u2019m not saying what. It really hurts my eclampsia, Lang\u2026\u2026If you turn a blind eye to Ufi, who has been listening to you in silence since the other day, he\u2019s got an unpleasant eyebrow.\u201cNot noble after that, but what is the son of a major merchant in the country as well? Rumors broke out in this case that the management of the Chamber of Commerce was inclined. There may be times when you may have been taken off your feet because you had a strong connection with the nobles.\u201d\u201c\u2026 now you\u2019re not even a nobleman, but a merchant\u2019s son went to an aristocratic college?I\u2019ve never questioned it before, but speaking of which, why was the merchant\u2019s son at the College of Aristocrats? I thought that was just a place to educate the aristocrats.\u201cThere are also children in the College of Aristocracy who have been welcomed into adoption, like Raini, or who plan to be taken as adopted children. If you pay to pass the exam, you\u2019ll be welcomed as a special student.\u201d\u201cThere was such a system?\u201cOtherwise I wonder if it would be difficult to live as a nobleman. Because it\u2019s also a social place. Even if you are taught manners at home, it is very difficult to connect. But you still need money to enroll, so you can\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re a millionaire merchant.\u201dHmm, it was. I don\u2019t know much about the college, so it\u2019s kind of fresh.\u201cHe said he was going to be a son-in-law in the noble house in the future. So I went to college earlier to get an education to be my son-in-law.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDid you have a fianc\u00e9e?!? I, I had no idea!?\u201dRaini reveals her surprise by opening up to the point where her eyes are going to pop out. Uh, that\u2019s why the merchant\u2019s son was at the College of Aristocrats. He said he went to college to be educated as an aristocrat in anticipation of becoming an aristocrat in the future.I was struck by Raini\u2019s charm. Besides, he said he stuck with his fianc\u00e9e to become a nobleman\u2026. Yeah, a little boulder for that.\u201cWhat was that merchant\u2019s son like?\u201c\u2026 with a very good face and soft hips. I took a step back because I\u2019m a civilian, but it\u2019s very popular with women, and I\u2019m being discouraged by men\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 so did they burn you because you might be in a similar position to yourself?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dRaini is also raised a civilian, and the situation is certainly similar in the form of an adopted son and a son-in-law. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sympathy or empathy, but I think I\u2019m getting close to Raini and caught up in the charm\u2026?Besides, I have a fianc\u00e9e, and I can\u2019t help but get annoyed in an environment where I think I can be a nobleman in the future, but I\u2019m being discouraged. Is that even a factor that got caught up in Raini\u2026?Is that why my son was taken care of?\u201cMr. Saran!?\u201d\u201cSaran? Is that the name of the merchant\u2019s son?\u201cRight. Saran Meki, son of the Meki Grand Chamber of Commerce.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve heard the name of the Chamber of Commerce on the boulder.\u201dThe Meki Grand Chamber of Commerce is a name I hear about. I have a wide range of businesses and have a thriving investment. You think it\u2019s a good chamber of commerce with a good gold spin and a good memory from the nobles? It\u2019s just like Tomas once told me there were some black rumors to make money.\u2026 I\u2019m a little more worried about the Cyan Baron family than I am about this. When this happens, I become aware that I really don\u2019t have enough hands. I almost zeroed my tongue by accident.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re totally out of hands. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t even let it happen.\u201dI wonder if my mother has tasted this itching tooth as well. No, maybe I\u2019m still savoring it.If you think so, you can\u2019t just hold him like this on a boulder.\u201cWell, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of homes that could potentially be enemies like this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sick of you\u2026\u2026. What house looks like you could be on my side?\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. If the house belongs to a faction of the Duke of Magenta\u2019s, it seems like you could use some help. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll follow me to Princess Anisphere from the bottom of my heart. This is Miss Uphilia with the neck.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the reason for this is because they think I\u2019m being treated with contempt by the royal family?Uffi asks as he narrows his eyes. Oh, well, maybe even the Duke\u2019s faction has a house that\u2019s drunk on Lord Grants, like Caindo-kun is drunk on Ufi.\u201cWell, you are. Some people say they were surrounded as the comforter of Princess Anisphere because Prince Algard dumped them\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, yeah. That\u2019s what they say.\u201dIn fact, I won\u2019t surround you. Comforter. Hey, no, yeah. What do you think? Instead I\u2019m the one who was consoled\u2026? No, I don\u2019t suppose that\u2019s what you mean, but maybe it\u2019s not a power relationship as we all think!?Perhaps that and this is also due to the fact that I remain unsure of the reality of magic. Intentionally, the information on the magic props came down, and this previous exhibition sponsored by the Ministry of Magic was ruined because of Al.\u201cActually, I was going to throw a tea party hosted by me to deepen my knowledge of magic\u2026\u201d\u201cAs far as it goes. So you can\u2019t tell which house to invite, and you\u2019re counting on me? Is that a recommendation from Your Majesty or the Queen?\u201cNo, I named the Graphite family\u201d\u201cHo ho! I see, Miss Uphilia. I wondered if His Majesty or the Queen had accidentally zeroed it. Then you can rest assured. Fine, then I can put it around, okay?\u201cReally? That\u2019s comforting\u201d\u201cBut, could you color the reward a little bit more?\u201cBesides Mana Blade? Right\u2026 I don\u2019t mind.\u201dThe connection with Miguel is now so precious that it seems like you can get your hands out of your throat. You don\u2019t have to spare it if that\u2019s what you get in a deal with demon props.Then he elbows on the table so Miguel can get in front and look straight at me. Many times I\u2019ve been seen, those curious eyes.\u201cThen would you enlighten me here on the philosophy of magic?\u201cThe philosophy of magic?\u201cWhy was magic born and for what? As an advocate, I\u2019d like you to speak to Princess Anisphere.\u201dThose eyes showed a greedy light with the momentum of not telling me to eat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: 48What is magic for? What is the philosophy of magic? To Miguel\u2019s inquiry I sink just a little into my own ideas. Set aside time to put it into words again, and then I stare back at Miguel and open my mouth.\u201cMagic is for magic. The philosophy of magic is meant to be unraveled.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026 you think magic exists for magic?\u201cThe beginning of magic science in the first place was because I couldn\u2019t use magic. Then why can\u2019t I use magic? I wanted to solve that mystery. It was to use magic, but above all, I had to learn magic.\u201dYou have to know magic to find out what makes magic unusable. I can\u2019t use magic. It was paradoxical in a way that I would learn magic deeply, and it might have looked odd or something funny from the side.But I didn\u2019t care about that. Because I knew. That perspective, that way of thinking. That was a good enough weapon to say it was the only one of mine at the time, brought from my memories of my previous life.\u201cIf magic can\u2019t be used in its present form, you have to know why it can\u2019t be used. Otherwise the magic won\u2019t be available. Demonic props created by magic are only by-products. Magic is an exploration to learn the essence, and I think it\u2019s academic. Now the basis of the teachings on the magic of the Kingdom of Palettia is theology. Learn the teachings of God, the teachings of the Spirit, and know his heart. Magic is not like that.\u201d\u201cSo what is magic you learn in magic? Magic is a miracle and nobility given by God and the Spirit. Anyone can teach it, right?\u201cWishes and prayers do work for the Spirit. They\u2019re our neighbors. So I\u2019m not saying theology itself is bad. But I wonder what to do with those who are not saved by prayer or wish. So I have to unravel the law and make it my own.\u201dNo matter how desperate you pray, no matter how truthful you wish. I could not use magic.Still, I couldn\u2019t stand to see the miracle there with my fingers. \u2018Cause there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been longing for there. Yet there was no reason not to reach out.\u201cI don\u2019t think praying or wishing is a mistake. But that\u2019s not the only way. That hasn\u2019t proven to be the only way. They haven\u2019t even figured it out. Then I\u2019ll have to do it. Because things always have a beginning and an end. Then I believed knowing it was the way to magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019ve often seemed like that since you were a child?Squeeze as Miguel admired just a little. Sure, it might be weird, but I think.\u201cMiguel doesn\u2019t question it?\u201cDoubt?\u201d\u201cHow can there be something I can\u2019t do,\u201d he said. There are people who can do it. If that\u2019s talent or blood muscle, there are a variety of conditions that you can\u2019t use. So I can finally give up. You won\u2019t be able to give up, but you can be convinced. But then it\u2019s up to him to end up there, right? I just didn\u2019t give up. \u201cIf you can\u2019t pray to the Spirit and use magic in the way you wish. Still, we don\u2019t give up using magic, we just have to find out about magic. If there\u2019s only one way, I\u2019ll have to give it up. You\u2019re free to give up there, and I\u2019m just talking about scratching my feet without giving up.It was the magic props that were born halfway down that road. I can finally tell you with my chest up that that is my magic. At that time, the very hope that I was able to connect because I didn\u2019t give up.\u201cSo magic is a discipline to know. Know the truth of the world not to give up, or to be convinced. Know and unravel the shapes and mechanisms of the world. That\u2019s, in a way, the opposite of our current policy. But it doesn\u2019t change the process of poking around.\u201dSame in the sense of facing the Spirit. However, that approach is just different.So I don\u2019t deny the magic way it is now either. Wishes, prayers, magic that draws strength from the Spirit are also nice.But as much as I love magic. The exploration of the existence of the Spirit, the elucidation of the mystery of magic. Both are nice, but the latter was the only one I could choose from. That\u2019s just the story.\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. Surely you are heterogeneous, Princess Anisphere. So I wonder what. Both the idea of magic and the invention of magic props are created. You only liked magic.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been magically distracted.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re from the Ministry of Magic, no. It doesn\u2019t fit with the idea of theology as you call it. For you, magic is the result.\u201d\u201c?\u2026 what do you mean?Miguel\u2019s rhetoric caught on oddly. It is stained that I do not fit with theology, but for me, magic is the result.\u201cMagic is not a result for those inclined to theology, Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then what do you say it is?\u201cMeans.\u201d\u201cMeans?\u201d\u201cMagic is a means to many. To approach the existence of God or the Spirit and give it its miracle. For one\u2019s own attachment to the absolute existence of the former glory, the Spirit or God. And the means for us to get close to it, and magic is not the result. That recognition is a huge gulf between you and the Ministry of Magic and theology.\u201d\u2026 inadvertently breathed. I never thought of it that way.Oh, well. Oh, my God. Was I from such a preliminary place?\u201c\u2026 I never thought about it. Oh, well. Magic is a means to everyone. Uffi, too, is that so?\u201c\u2026 right. It was natural for me to be able to use magic. I certainly wouldn\u2019t deny it if they said it was a means.\u201d\u201cI may have come to that idea because I couldn\u2019t use magic\u2026\u2026 it tastes a little bad\u201d\u201cUnpleasant?\u201dUnexpectedly frowning at Miguel\u2019s point. I wonder what you would say tastes bad. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t taste good that I didn\u2019t properly understand the perception was eating wrong, but is there anything more unsavory about it than that?\u201cIt\u2019s not just the theory of spiritual stones and demonic stones or the development of demonic props that Princess Anisphere is said to be blaspheming spirits and gods.\u201c Using \u201cthe very existence of the Spirit. That\u2019s the best way to reverse the nasty emotional part. For example, the Spirit Stone is what Princess Anisphere should call the carcass of the Spirit, as the Spirit itself had no will and was a spiritual being feeding on magic. I can\u2019t help but remember my anger from those who worship it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then tell me what kind of protection the Spirit gave me. You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t use magic?I was a little frustrated and got a thorn in my remarks. I\u2019ve regretted it since I put it in my mouth, but you do, don\u2019t you? What did the presence of the Spirit do to me? Even though it\u2019s the result of my research because you won\u2019t do anything for me.\u201cMaybe the facts are. But I don\u2019t want the facts.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then what do you want?\u201d\u201cTo remain with the great being of the Spirit. That way we can use the miracle of magic. It promises me my place, my future\u2026. so I can\u2019t accept Princess Anisphere who could rock it from the root\u201dI understand what Miguel is saying. Understandable. But I can\u2019t empathize. I chewed my back teeth hard on that frustration. I feel sick about the toothpick that sounded in my mouth.\u201c\u2026 I do not deny faith. Even I don\u2019t appreciate spirits. But that\u2019s not what it is.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe Spirit is only with nature, not on our side, not our parents. Spirits, spirits, but they don\u2019t have the basics of will, do they? There are spirits and gods out there who interfere in the way we do things? You\u2019re not.\u201dThat\u2019s absolutely crazy.\u201cIt\u2019s not like humans are slaves following spirits.\u201d\u201cSlaves\u2026\u2026 even slaves!? Ha ha! Don\u2019t say that in a great way! Princess Anisphere!\u201cBecause it\u2019s not. If you want to follow the Spirit so much, you can do whatever you want, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be national policy, I am.\u201dBecause we are human beings. I can\u2019t believe the miracle of magic was given to me by the Spirit, and that\u2019s why the Spirit doesn\u2019t want subordination, but he doesn\u2019t recognize it according to its teachings. The guy who said that is set to win.\u2018Cause the Spirit never asked man for anything explicitly. It\u2019s always human that I asked the Spirit for. The Spirit performs the miracle of magic using such human magic as food. That\u2019s just it for me.\u201cIf you say that magic can be used as great as those close to the Spirit. So people who can\u2019t use magic aren\u2019t worth it? That can\u2019t be right. How many civilians do you think there are? Shouldn\u2019t we use a miracle called magic to protect such powerless people or to fill their lives?Magic is a miracle to make someone smile. I know the reality isn\u2019t that easy. But magic to me is a nice thing to make someone happy.All kinds of frustration accumulate in my stomach at once. I don\u2019t care what you think. It\u2019s all about getting close to the Spirit, if magic is the means for it. I wonder if that\u2019s what we should be disclosing more magic to the people.\u201cWhat Princess Anisphere says is especially true. If you\u2019re saying magic is everything, there\u2019s no way out of view of what a civilian who can\u2019t use magic can do. Well, I\u2019m free to see what the nobility thinks of civilians who can\u2019t use magic. Unless you say it or it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201d\u201cBut the Ministry of Magic interfered with the kingdom. That\u2019s why I questioned Princess Anisphere, the princess who created the new theory of magic\u2026 because it was the words that I wanted to hear\u201d\u201c\u2026 Miguel?\u201cI don\u2019t like nobility because I\u2019m tough. But I was born with power. The status of being born into a house called Nobility and the power of being able to use magic. Responsibility arises there. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201dThat\u2019s what Miguel said. He was erasing an attitude that seemed light-hearted. There he is, born in the Marquis Graphite family, showing the attitude that his status deserves. The look looks at me with seriousness itself.\u201cNobility is for the country and for the people. Luxurious homes, luxurious living. I was educated so much that my ears seemed to be able to make octopuses that I would be forgiven for taking charge and fulfilling my responsibilities. Don\u2019t take that for granted.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re a tough house\u201d\u201cHistory tells us the end of the house where we forgot about it. We should not rot more than we were born into nobility. Because if it rots, it will be the last thing you have to truncate. I don\u2019t want to be that way, and I\u2019m sorry those guys stand up there. I want to live my life while I can.\u201dThat said Miguel takes his seat and walks up to my side. He stayed on one knee and drooled his head.\u201cI just don\u2019t want the relationship of alliance to collapse. Because of this relationship, there is something called loyalty that can be dedicated. So think of this as an act of personal respect.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Miguel\u201d\u201cPrincess Anisphere, please let me serve this self. Now this country is quietly experiencing a national disaster. Strong leaders are therefore required. That\u2019s why I want you to stand on top.\u201dMiguel\u2019s words were very sincere. About to snort by accident.\u2026 That\u2019s why I feel awfully sorry for you too. Yeah, if you\u2019ve told me this far, I\u2019ll have to tell you.\u201c\u2026 Miguel, keep your head up. We are only allies. Keep your respect in your chest. And that\u2019s why I want to tell you.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 as a matter of fact, I\u2019ve been told that there\u2019s an option not to be king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?Miguel looks up and makes an interesting voice. I cough to breathe.Turn your gaze toward Uffi before opening your mouth. Yufi nodded quietly at me. Looks like Uffi thought it was okay to talk to Miguel.\u201cThat also depends on the elucidation of the spiritual covenant\u2026. As a result, I may not be king. I\u2019m going to adopt him instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026 its adopted son is no way\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dYufi quietly raises his name. Miguel\u2019s gaze shifts from me to Uffi.And he laughed like he said what was wrong. I grin, then breathe, and wipe the tears that floated because I laughed too much.\u201cThat\u2019s too much ghost bills! No, I do think it\u2019s a hand to adopt Miss Uphilia!\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking into spiritual contracts. If I can, I can, if I can\u2019t, Yufi can. In the first place, if a spiritual contract is impossible, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\u201cI see! So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s the king\u2019s life! That\u2019s funny to hear!Hit Miguel in the hand with pleasure as he sits back in the chair. Fine, I said something important, but it\u2019s okay\u2026 right?\u201cBut suppose Miss Uphilia is adopted and becomes queen. What will Princess Anisphere do?\u201c\u2026 it\u201dIf Uffi becomes king. I no longer have a duty to be king. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be prepared for when something happens to Yufi.When such a future comes, huh? Honestly, I wasn\u2019t thinking. \u2018Cause I\u2019ve been giving up on dreams like that lately.\u201c\u2026 beside Yufi, I want to spread and develop magic for this country. Even if Uffi is going to be king, it\u2019s not a stone. That\u2019s why I want to support you. I want to do what I want. What I can do.\u201dNot as a king, but as one \u201cwizard\u201d.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I want to spread magic as one person, not as a national duty.I want to see everyone take demon props and enrich their lives.I\u2019d like to see something that was born of an idea that I couldn\u2019t think of.Take that by Uffi. With Uffi. If Yufi bears the burden of being king, I want to be there for him.If you will allow me to be free, I want to live with Uffi, who freed me above all else.Now I can say that with my chest up. Because I like this guy. Because I love this guy.Then the look on Miguel\u2019s face as he looked at me soothed.\u201c\u2026 as good as it gets. Miss Uphilia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is this what you want to protect\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dI\u2019m snorting like we both figured something out, but I don\u2019t know what. It seems oddly embarrassing. No, I do have a lot of protection for Uffi! Mostly peace of mind or something! It\u2019s also yuffy to rough up that peace of mind!\u201cHa. Well, if you ask me that, I\u2019m not going to change my attitude. Either way, it\u2019s going to be better than it is now. And my respect for Princess Anisphere belongs to me personally. We\u2019ll split our positions.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad you said that. Honestly, I\u2019m just very comfortable with the same age I met recently\u2026\u201dMiguel tells me he admires me, but he won\u2019t confuse it with the Marquis\u2019 position. I was able to earn that trust at this tea party. That\u2019s why I can break my belly and keep pace with Miguel, too.I can\u2019t say I\u2019m on your complete side. But unless I\u2019m mistaken, I can build a cooperative relationship unless it clashes with Miguel\u2019s interests. That reassures me the other way around.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s what the Ministry of Magic did\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to deny it until I thought,\u201dFaith should be free. But I don\u2019t think it tastes good once you separate it from politics.That\u2019s what Uffi and I need to do in the future. It\u2019s hard for me alone, and I can\u2019t do just Yufi, because it\u2019s the two of us, together.That doesn\u2019t change which way you become king. So there is no anxiety.\u201cI\u2019ll look into the Ministry\u2019s moves. If you\u2019re a princess, it\u2019ll be hard to get information.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Miguel.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for the country. And if magic spreads, it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun. A tea party that spreads magic will lend a hand in the shadows so that the story can proceed successfully. Of course you can invite me, right?\u201cYeah, definitely. It would be helpful if you brought your friend.\u201dMiguel smiled niggardly at my words and gave it back to me. I think I could have returned it with a full smile, too.After that, I broke up with Miguel. It would be better if we didn\u2019t meet frequently in person, but he said he would try to get in touch with us somehow, so our discussion was over.The day passes after the tea party with Miguel. As always, the investigation of the materials was difficult to navigate, and when I started talking to Uffi about filling the roots without specifications, I began to reduce the frequency.\u201cDear Anisphere, Miguel wrote to you.\u201d\u201cFrom Miguel?\u201cYes, I received it through my royal palace maid\u201dTake Miguel\u2019s letter that Ilia received, cut the seal and check the contents.I\u2019m going to check the contents, and generally Yufi calls me when I finish reading and try to fold the letter.\u201cWhat did Miguel say?\u201cI\u2019m a tea party for spreading magic, but first, I said I should be invited as a guest once before I host. He said you should turn your hand around the back so that invitations reach me from the aristocracy interested in magic, so you can make allies there, and then host and spread the word.\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming\u201dI\u2019m guessing this is where Miguel can help us. The only way to gather the rest of my allies is for me to take a good chance.But you say. I knew the Graphite Marquis wouldn\u2019t stand out and come up with a name. Somehow it sounds very intelligence. It\u2019s a talent that wasn\u2019t around me. I want to keep my connection to Miguel important in the future. Shall I do a little research on Miguel, with what I like?\u201cSpeaking of which, you haven\u2019t received any invitations lately\u201d\u201cOh, they spread that somewhat so that Father would refrain because I couldn\u2019t let go of my hand with royal life. I\u2019m making magic available in spiritual contracts, so don\u2019t interrupt me.\u201dHonestly, I really appreciate it. I have no choice but to be royal in my belly exploration, but I\u2019m just tired of being intended for it.\u201c\u2026 eheh\u201d\u201c? What\u2019s wrong, suddenly\u201d\u201cMmm. I was loved more than I thought.\u201dI still feel strongly that you can protect me. That makes me weirdly ticklish, comfortable and grinning.That\u2019s why we have to work hard. It was right after I thought so.\u201cAh, Master Uphilia!\u201c? Raini?Once again, Raini comes in just a little faster, calling Yufi. Yufi blinks her eyes wondering if anything happened to Raini\u2019s condition.Raini then looks a little troubled and gives Yufi a letter.\u201cNow, it\u2019s better for Uphilia.\u201d\u201cUsing? From whom?\u201c\u2026 from Master Halfis\u201d\u201c\u2026 from Halphis?Uffi blinked her eyes as surprised, and dropped her gaze on the letter she received in wonder.Speaking of which, it may be unusual for a letter to reach Uffi. Who\u2019s Halfis?\u201cWho\u2019s Halfis?\u201cI\u2019m an alumni of the College of Aristocrats. \u2026 I don\u2019t think there was any contact.\u201dUffi tilts his neck as if a little confused. In the meantime, did you decide to take a look at the letter or cut the seal?As he continues to read the contents, Uffi\u2019s eyes open in amazement. And he nodded as he was convinced and turned to me.\u201c\u2026 Sounds like Miguel planted it\u201d\u201cHmm? I mean, that\u201d\u201cYep. He was a schoolmate and asked me to tell him that he wanted to meet with Anis. Looks like a tea party invitation.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: 49An invitation to a tea party that reached me through Ufi. If I sent out a reply stating that I would participate in the tea party, I would return immediately with a reply specifying a detailed date, time and place.If it\u2019s a tea party on a boulder, I have to dress up pretty good, too. For this reason, you will travel by carriage. Ilia is leaving a message this time, with Yufi and Raini. And the carriage led us to a corner lined with aristocratic mansions.It\u2019s also a place I visited when I disturbed Count Sprout\u2019s house. If the carriage stops at one of the houses, the gatekeeper, who had refrained at the entrance to the mansion, bows his head respectfully.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. Princess Anisphere, Lady Duke of Uphilia, Lady Baron Raini\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u201cI will show you to your daughter. Please wait while the butler arrives.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOnce again, the gatekeeper returns to the gate with his respects. If you think you\u2019ve had any conversation with another gatekeeper you were packing inside, one of them heads inside the mansion.Waiting to see if he\u2019d gone to get a butler to guide him, Raini was shaking his shoulder in a restless manner.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Raini.\u201d\u201cYes, no. I knew I wasn\u2019t used to being called a baroness\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re a lady even if you\u2019re a samurai. Look, be grand.\u201dWith his hands on his shoulders and encouraging Raini, Yufi laughs strangely with his hands on his mouth. What a peaceful time to wait, a man in butler\u2019s clothes comes this way.When the butler comes before us, he thanks us deeply and then raises his face.\u201cThank you for waiting. Welcome to the Viscount Nebles family. I\u2019ll show you to your daughter.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cThis way, please.\u201dThis time, we were invited by Miss Halfis of the Viscount of Nebles. I mean Yufi and Raini\u2019s alumni, but they didn\u2019t have that much contact. Well, I wonder what the hell kind of kid he is.It was Salon who was guided by the butler. One girl sat and waited at a circle table set in the center of it. When the girl notices that we have entered the room, she takes a seat and walks over here.\u201cI\u2019ll catch your eye first, Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere. My name is Halphis Nebles. It is a great honor to have you here today.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Miss Halfis. It\u2019s Anisphere Win Palettia. I was looking forward to seeing you at the tea party this time.\u201dCarefully bowed her head, Miss Halfis is tied up with slightly brighter brown hair and dressed in a dress that is not overly flashy. Is it the \u201cchairman of the committee\u201d from what I have seen in my previous life? If it\u2019s glasses, it looks like it.He shook my hand in a manner I feared if I asked him to shake it. At the end of my greeting with me, I also turn my gaze to Yufi and Raini, who were holding back behind me.\u201cDear Uphilia, and Mr. Raini. We\u2019re out of time.\u201d\u201cNo, it sounds like a breath disaster, above all. Halphis.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re out of time\u2026\u201dExchange greetings with Halfis in a contrasting attitude: Raini, who is nervously solidified with natural Ufi. Miss Halfis blinks her eyes just a little, then coughs them up and then urges us to take a seat.A maid from the Viscount Navles brought us tea and sweets if we took our seats. Moisten your throat with tea first. Yeah, I guess that\u2019s where the flavor is.\u201cAgain, thank you for visiting my house this time\u201d\u201cNo, because I thought this was a good opportunity\u2026. but can I ask? I heard that neither Yufi nor Raini have much contact with you.\u201d\u201cRight. I won\u2019t deny that. So I was thinking about saying no.\u201dOnly a few words before Miss Halfis nodded small. Then he looks up like he decided to after wandering his gaze backwards somewhere.\u201cWhen you were at the College of Aristocrats, it was difficult for you to get too close\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard some stories, but what was it like in college Yufi and Raini? I hear it\u2019s hard to lean on.\u201d\u201cMaster Uphilia, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to do anything about it. If you threw me a question, you would have answered it. Sometimes there were a lot of people around me, but I admit I was under pressure because I still performed well and acted brilliantly on my feet. Furthermore, I am the daughter of the Viscount family. It was courageous of those who were not factions of the Duke of Magenta to speak up.\u201dI guess it feels like it\u2019s because it\u2019s scary for a low-status person who is barely a faction to talk to Ufi. Well, I don\u2019t even know that.\u201cMr. Raini was by his side, starting with Prince Algard\u2026 I knew visibly that Mr. Raini was unfamiliar with the nobility, but I couldn\u2019t have the courage to jump into the vortex myself without any particular edge.\u201dTo the Prince, to the Secretary of the Ministry of Magic, to the son of the Commander of the Kingsguard Knights, and to the son of Uncle Borderline, a luxurious son. I can see the shadow of a man like that. You don\u2019t want to get near Raini. It\u2019s not about nobility either, if it\u2019s also about being a former civilian child.That\u2019s not a funny story either. So I\u2019m also convinced Halfis has thin contacts with the two of them.\u201cWhat might you think would be thicker if two people couldn\u2019t help themselves in hard times\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. One of those things was my immaturity. It\u2019s not like Halfis cares.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. That, well, I wasn\u2019t good either\u2026 ah, I figured I\u2019d better stand up too\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you were accompanied as a samurai, but I hope you will remain seated as an alumni. What do you say? Mr. Raini.\u201d\u201c\u2026 let me sweeten your words\u201dYou look like the cat I borrowed, Raini. I resented him for laughing that Raini looked strange and dull by accident. I got my eyes turned.I don\u2019t feel anything bad about Yufi and Raini from Miss Halfis. I guess the distance wasn\u2019t intimate, as they said. I somehow know that two people in college are hard to lean on, so I\u2019m not even going to blame them for that.Then again, I guess Miss Halfis\u2019s aim is to have a connection with me as the text suggests. I know it\u2019s Miguel\u2019s planting, but I have to figure out how I\u2019ve planted it.\u201cSo, Miss Halfis, may I ask why you invited me today?\u201cYes\u2026. can I call other customers before we talk about that?\u201cOther customers?\u201cYes. My fianc\u00e9e and her friend are inviting me, too. I would like you to meet Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere\u2026 if this is inconvenient, let me explain it to you.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dYour fianc\u00e9e and that friend with you? I wonder if this is Miguel\u2019s planting, too. Where will Miss Halfis\u2019s sincerity lie? I haven\u2019t seen that yet, so I\u2019ll take a good look.She drops off Miss Halfis\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and the butler who apparently went to get that friend, and puts her mouth on the tea treat. Hmm, not bad. Maybe I\u2019ll make it for Raini next time.Tongue drumming on tea and sweets, the butler returns within less time. Two young people followed in.One looks like a serious young man with dark brown hair. This one feels \u201ccommittee chairman\u201d too. If I had glasses, it would still look like that.The other one is a brother-in-law. She has a big body but looks like a Buddha\u2026\u2026. hmm? That, I mean, it looks familiar, I knew him.\u201cOh, Gakun.\u201d\u201cWould you stop calling me Gakkun, Master Anisphere! It\u2019s a gark!\u201d\u201cNo, the style is beautiful.\u201d\u201cWhat style beauty\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know him? Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cGakun\u2026\u2026 Gark was an adventurer. My parents are part of the Knights of the Borders and I also aspire to join the Knights. I got a request for an escort for an outdoor exercise, and it was me who got it connected.\u201dGark Lamp. He was born as the son of the Baron Lamp family and father, a member of the Knights of the Borders. He is a young man who aspires to become a knight to succeed his parents.\u201cSo, who beat me to Cotempan\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t!\u201cLost?\u201cI told you to go home if you\u2019re a princess, so I did a mock fight and I messed it up.\u201dWell, it was a sword battle with only physical strengthening. Even I can\u2019t do something unscrupulous without the aid of engraving. I told Gakun he could use magic, but he just tried to strengthen his body, so he won it all.The results also accompanied the outdoor exercise properly. Then it was hard because it\u2019s really something that demons come out of. Gakun and I fought properly against demons among them, so I\u2019m pretty hopeful for you because I think it\u2019s a prospect, I guess I even said so.\u201cHow many years? About two years? How are you? Why are you in Wang Du again?\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. He was trained in the Kingsguard Knights now.\u201d\u201cTo the Kingsguard Knights? Why, again, I think it\u2019s a little different from the border\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, well. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201dI lean my neck towards Gakun, who says something spicy. Then I noticed a serious looking young man standing next to me smiling softly.\u201cThe martial arts tradition that Gark was talking about was true, wasn\u2019t it? No, I wasn\u2019t suspicious. I\u2019ll see you first, Princess Anisphere. My name is Marion Anti. I will be the youngest brother of the Count Anti family.\u201d\u201cCount Antie\u2019s house?That one, I remember hearing it somewhere. Marion smiles bitterly as I lean my neck in doubt.\u201cMy father may know. My father currently works for the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, you should have said that\u201dCount Anti. I remember being a less harmful person. I\u2019m not even close. Few people adopt that kind of \u201cleave me out of it\u201d attitude in the Ministry of Magic.The Ministry of Magic isn\u2019t a complete rock either. I don\u2019t bite my magic, but I don\u2019t even try to get it in my eyes. A force that is opportunistic, for better or worse.There are three main reactions to me in the Ministry of Magic, one force that bites me by saying it\u2019s blasphemy or something, and one force that also hears that my story makes sense. And at the end of the day, I\u2019m not involved. You don\u2019t listen to me, but I can also say people who don\u2019t agree that theory is a rush.To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to interfere either because I didn\u2019t want to. I wasn\u2019t pushing for understanding. But I guess we need to convince and convince these people in the future.\u201cHalfis invited Princess Anisphere today, and I wanted to be there.\u201d\u201cOh, so you\u2019re Miss Halfis\u2019s?\u201cI will be your fianc\u00e9e. In the future, I think I\u2019ll be the son-in-law. My brother will inherit the house\u2026\u201d\u201cI see. How do you know Gakun?\u201cIt was synchronization with the Academy of Aristocrats\u201d\u201cWell, it was synchronized.\u201dWhen you\u2019re done saying hello, everyone takes their seats. Confirming that, Miss Halfis looked over at everyone before turning to me. The expression is serious in itself, and I correct my habitation naturally, too.\u201cOkay, so we\u2019re all set. First of all, thank you again for attending the tea party I hosted. And the reason I hosted the tea party today was\u2026 Princess Anisphere. Please, I want you to ask us for a professor.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Professor?\u201cof magic, its wisdom.\u201dI frowned at Miss Halfis\u2019s words. I want you to give me the wisdom of magic, hey.\u201cMay I ask why?\u201cI\u2019m not sneaky to expose myself to shame\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure my magical arm is okay. Whatever the grades of the college, whether it\u2019s seating or manners, magic will be quicker to count from below.\u201dMiss Halfis zeroes a grunt that seeps so much remorse that she seems to bite her lips. Besides, I look like I\u2019m in trouble. I was in the middle of a conversation, but I\u2019m going to pinch my mouth.\u201cI want you to wait a minute. So why would you want to hear about magic? If you\u2019re looking for something magical, I say no.\u201d\u201cYes, no! Oh, no, it\u2019s not! I don\u2019t mean to do that! It\u2019s just\u2026 I have my doubts.\u201d\u201cDoubt?\u201d\u201c\u2026 distrust of the Spirit\u201dMiss Halfis shrugs as if confessing her sins. distrust of the Spirit, I frowned when I heard.That does make it sound like a confession of sin. Because that\u2019s a wrong thought as a magician, as a teaching in this country.\u201cMany times I read the magic textbook and deciphered the references. I changed my daily life and continued enthusiastically with indispensable prayer for the Spirit. But my magic never showed any signs of improvement\u2026\u2026 but if I talk to my parents and teachers about it, they will say. As long as you don\u2019t believe, magic will never improve.\u201dThe Spirit receives people\u2019s prayers and wishes, and gives them the miracle of magic. That is the general perception of magic in this country as well.Faith in the Spirit dulls magic. Don\u2019t doubt the Spirit. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they said. I know because I\u2019ve been told, too. Believe in the Spirit more.\u201c\u2026 my engagement with Marion was made under the promise that my father would serve Marion\u2019s father well and unite his children to deepen their relationship with each other\u2019s homes. But I\u2019m told I shouldn\u2019t blank my engagement because I don\u2019t have the magic talent.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026 my parents?\u201cNo, my father\u2019s surroundings.\u201dIt was Marion who replied in place of Miss Halfis. Miss Halfis bites her lips and lets her gaze down.\u201cI am the son of a member of the Ministry of Magic. Yet they say that magic is inferior to the other\u2019s son-in-law. I was wondering if you could reconsider to leave some excellent blood behind.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIs Marion good?\u201cAs a young man, I went straight into the Ministry of Magic with my graduation\u201d\u201cWhich means you\u2019re good.\u201dIt takes a lot of magical talent to enter the Ministry of Magic. Is it the influence, the people in the Ministry of Magic are generally elite thinking. In fact, I admit he\u2019s an excellent wizard.\u201cBecause my brother will inherit my home, I have no choice but to merit to start a new home or enter my son-in-law\u2019s house elsewhere. My father and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to destroy our engagement, but the pressure is getting stronger, and I haven\u2019t had an invitation from your daughter once or twice.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a story that comes down unexpectedly. Marion does look good. I guess it\u2019s an excellent property if you think you just have the strength to get into the Ministry of Magic there. I have to leave the house, so maybe a lot of ladies want to welcome me home.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like trying to take it away from someone who has a fianc\u00e9e. I wish that engagement wreck was a round one, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201cThis situation, even for me, is unintentional. Honestly, I have to wonder what the Spirit is and what magic is for while I\u2019m about to stop by Halfis\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 as good as it gets\u201dIt\u2019s like instinct to want better blood. That\u2019s not to be denied. Marion and those who work around him may also be words from goodwill. To leave a good wizard behind.Plus Miss Halfis\u2019s position is weak when the other person becomes the son of the Count family. I don\u2019t think there are many who would rather be in our home than Miss Halfis if they were son-in-law.\u201cOriginally the Viscount Nebles family was a house the knight was pleased with. That loyalty and mindset is still handed down today. For the country, and for the Anties who took us. \u2026 I have thought that I should pull back, which is not even me.\u201dMiss Halfis, who was biting off her lips, slowly raised her face. There\u2019s a sad look there. That\u2019s about all I could tell you about how much I was worried about.\u201cStill, I admire Master Marion. I don\u2019t want to lie about this feeling.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know what happened to Miss Halfis. The history of distrust of the Spirit is also painful. So why are you asking me to talk to you?\u201cI heard rumors. Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere said that magic was academic. That\u2019s an unprecedented magical point of view, and you\u2019ll be able to expand your visibility. Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere is now looking for new talent to teach magic.\u201d\u201cRumor, hey\u201d\u201cWe have also heard that His Majesty gave his royal life in anticipation of the point of view of magic. If you ask me\u2026 I have prepared seats like this without being present or standing.\u201d\u2026 As far as I can tell, I understand the story. I unwittingly arm myself and shut up.Yeah, I got the story. But I don\u2019t know how to convey this thought to her.\u201c\u2026 I also somehow understand why Marion is here. You want to help Miss Halfis, don\u2019t you?\u201cI\u2019ve come to question myself, for some reason\u2026\u2026 yes. I love her too. I don\u2019t want to keep messing around with people.\u201dMarion also mouths spicy. Makes me want to exhale by accident.\u201cWhat about Gakun?\u201cPlease call me by my proper name!\u2026 I\u2019m not as deeply troubled as Marion or Miss Halfis. I just feel my limitations, don\u2019t I? I can\u2019t stretch my magic anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 not serious, but the same worries as Miss Halfis?\u201cNo, I,\u2026 No, I, ha\u201d\u201cUh, no more, just break it down and talk. Because I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cHi-no\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t think magic has to stretch. I\u2019m a knight, and I know magic isn\u2019t the only way to be strong. I think it\u2019s smarter to bow your head to someone who knows how to be strong enough to do something that doesn\u2019t fit your height.\u201d\u201cSo you want to rely on magic?\u201cRather than relying on it, I want to know if you can see from Master Anisphere whether you can still stretch the magic. I want to be strong. It doesn\u2019t have to be magic.\u201dGakun looks straight at me and says so. In a way, should I say clean? Whether magic really doesn\u2019t stretch, and if it doesn\u2019t, is there another way? In that sense, it\u2019s positive compared to Miss Halfis and Marion.I listen to them so far, and the bitter things in me spread inside me. Exhale slowly and mouth wishing that bitter feeling was not poisonous.\u201cI\u2019m honestly glad you\u2019re expecting me, and it\u2019s an honor. But I don\u2019t know if I can help you\u2026\u201d\u201c- Dear Anis,I don\u2019t know, the mouth I tried to say was blocked by Uffi. Yufi is staring at me with only a few eyes caught. What, why is Yufi staring at me\u2026?\u201cDear Anis, you can\u2019t speak of that\u201d\u201cBut, Uffi\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who decide that. They\u2019re just begging you to teach them, and they\u2019re not asking you to save them\u2026\u2026. I know how you feel. But what you need now is not kindness. Confidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Confidence?\u201cTrust your\u201c magic. \u201cWhat you have learned about the path you have taken. There will also be a responsibility on the part of teaching. You\u2019ll also need to guide them right. But as much as you learn, you have to think about it and be prepared to choose the right path\u2026. you should decline if their readiness is disproportionate. So if Anis doesn\u2019t speak with confidence, he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so confident\u201dThoughts floating like starch. Can I teach anyone about magic, my God? Because I can\u2019t use magic. All this time, those thoughts were lying in my heart. I wonder how I can preach the teachings of \u201cmagic itself\u201d to someone who can use magic.But. If I can\u2019t\u2026 Then who the hell can? I am also familiar with the bitterness of not being able to use magic. What has saved me from such suffering? If you think about it, you\u2019ll get your own answers.\u201c\u2026 right. Thank you, Uffi. I shouldn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause I don\u2019t know.\u201d Look for answers. That\u2019s my way of life. So if you can\u2019t do that\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you. My magic is not meant to save someone. I\u2019m thinking about walking out to save myself. \u201cMy thoughts gradually settle when I speak for myself. \u201cMagic\u201d is a miracle to me that makes someone smile. But I was never given the miracle.But I didn\u2019t want a miracle from me. I did want to use it. Instead of praying for a miracle though, I chose the path to grasp hope.That\u2019s my way of life. There was no miracle for me, but there is hope that I found it myself. I don\u2019t know, so move on. I may have been really scared to ask someone to be ready for that.\u201cMiss Halfis, Marion,\u2026 and then Gakkun\u201d\u201cNext!? Please stop gagging!?\u201d\u201cChip\u2026\u2026 Bye, Gark. I\u2019m gonna ask the three of you again, okay? Are you ready to grab the stars?\u201c\u2026 the stars? No, you can\u2019t reach that.\u201dHey, Gah. Read the air, that\u2019s why you\u2019re gagging, gagging! You bastard!\u201cThat\u2019s what my magic is all about. I flew through the sky. Then we have to be willing to grab the stars next time. There is no end. Nobody decides. It\u2019s all up to you. Someone won\u2019t be ready to finish it, or maybe they won\u2019t help. Still ready to shape dreams you can\u2019t grasp?Three people shut up about my inquiry. And it was Miss Halfis who opened her mouth first a little while later.\u201cAs long as you keep exposed to yourself without even being like this, I\u2019d like to follow the stars even if they say you\u2019re unusual and funny. Please show me the mark for this, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cFrom me, too, please. If this is another way to explore, we will be ready to continue later.\u201dMiss Halfis is followed by Marion who also looks straight at me and says: If you look into those eyes, it\u2019s silly to ask them if they\u2019re ready.Gakun\u2026 what, let me hold your mouth. What is that attitude that doesn\u2019t boil off?\u201c\u2026 Gurk. Why don\u2019t you just confess?\u201d\u201cStop it, Marion\u201d\u201cYou said you joined the Kingsguard knights, not the border, because you wanted to be near the Princess Anisphere you admired.\u201d\u201cDuhhhh!?\u201d\u2026 Huh?\u201cWhy do you say it in front of him?\u201d\u201cI guess it\u2019s because you don\u2019t boil it off. You\u2019ve been admiring Princess Anisphere since I went home on a long vacation and suddenly told you I was going to join the Kingsguard Knights when I got back. I knew I was desperately thinking of dialogue by myself if I could take that teaching\u2026\u201d\u201cYa, stop, wow, wow, wow!!\u201d\u201cShut up, Gah\u201dWhy is it such an idea to admire me when I did it to you? Are you a mazo?\u201cNo, it\u2019s not! I\u2019m really just impressed with Master Anisphere\u2026! Oh, no, Marion! You!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I know Gakun too, so be quiet\u201d\u201cGoddamn it\u2026 kill it\u2026!There\u2019s no demand, Gakun said! Shut up already!And Raini, don\u2019t point your raw, warm gaze at me. Don\u2019t even look at me with a smile on your face. Goddamn it, Gah\u2026!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: 50\u201cOh hon! Er\u2026 the air went crazy because of Gakun\u2026\u201d\u201cMy fault!?\u201d\u201cGakun shut up for a while. I don\u2019t mind teaching magic. Of course, you shouldn\u2019t talk too much out of it. Because the way I think is still heretical. That\u2019s in mind.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dMiss Halfis replies well. That\u2019s a good reply. Marion, who\u2019s nodding next door, also has a good look on his face. Gakun\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201cIt\u2019s just that magic isn\u2019t like an answer to figuring out how to make magic work. Instead, perhaps we should call it magic.\u201dThe truth is that magic science uses the knowledge of 'science\u201d of previous life. It\u2019s abbreviated magic. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to learn magic, so I also think it\u2019s right to say magic.\u201cThey say that magic is a fairly worn opinion compared to magic classes, spirituality and theology, which are mainstream in the Kingdom of Palettia. Theology attaches importance to prayer and faith in the Spirit, but in magic I want those perspectives off if I can.\u201d\u201cOff point of view, is it?\u201cIt\u2019s magic to figure out what\u2019s actually happening. So don\u2019t stop thinking because I prayed strongly for the process until magic was activated, or because it was a miracle given to me by God or the Spirit. That\u2019s the first entrance to magic.\u201dQuestion things. And unravel the laws of the world to be your own. Simply put, that\u2019s the thing. Demonic props are also demonstrations and by-products of that knowledge.So I don\u2019t want you to stop thinking. I want you to keep questioning me. That becomes the first entrance to magic. The questioning begins all the questioning.\u201cThen what can we do to dispel the doubt? We have to gather information. But what kind of information do we need? In order to gain knowledge, we have to gain the perception that is a prerequisite.\u201d\u201cIs information important?\u201d\u201cYeah. Shall we talk about something like that? Suppose I have three apples. I took this one at a time. I mean, there are three people who gave them apples. How many apples did you give me if the information about the number of people you gave me and the number of people you gave me was missing from this story? I wonder how many apples you got from who? You\u2019re not gonna know, are you? There could be one person who gave him the apple, maybe two. But there will never be more than three. Pick up the possibilities, squeeze the options out of them and look for answers. It\u2019s been a rough explanation, but I want you to think this is the basics of doing it in magic.\u201dThe more I look at you listening to me, the more I nod and think. Gakun had his arms together and his neck tilted.\u201cNo, but there were three people who gave the apples to Master Anisphere, so you gave them one at a time, didn\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s what I know because I gave you proper premise information, and it starts by looking for that\u201c information \u201dto figure out my doubts.\u201d\u201cHard!\u201dHe says he\u2019s trying to explain it as plainly as he can, but if he\u2019s gagged. Ugh.\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a hole filling problem.\u201d\u201cHole filling?\u201d\u201cI just know the answer. Then how do we make a ceremony to get that answer? I received three apples as a result. If I add the information on the person who gave them to me and the number of pieces they gave me, that would mean I received three apples, right?\u201c\u2026 oh! If there were two of those holes, would one of them have only one apple!\u201cThat\u2019s right. Maybe the\u201c process \u201dleading up to it is different, even if it looks like the same answer. That\u2019s how it\u2019s important to verify over and over again.\u201dWell, if it\u2019s as easy as the story goes, I\u2019m not having a hard time either. That\u2019s the infinite number of possibilities if you line them up. Crushing that possibility and deriving only the right answers is an uninterrupted effort.Still, with the gathering of knowledge and experience, we will also be able to derive answers by intuition. But sometimes I can\u2019t find it even though the experience is a simple thing to pull my leg on, so good and bad depends on the time and the circumstances.\u201cThat\u2019s why I looked into it. The process leading up to the consequences of my inability to use magic. Is the question\u201c magic \u201d? Then what\u2019s\u201c magic \u201cmade of? Who\u2019s generating magic? Spirit, right? Then the Spirit must also be examined. Look, there\u2019s so much to look into. So don\u2019t stop questioning me. You can\u2019t drown in doubt, though.\u201d\u201cThat leads to Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere\u2019s spiritual theory\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Halfis, you have a hard attitude. Ennis is fine. I\u2019ll call it off, too.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, if that\u2019s what Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere says\u2026\u201dEven though it\u2019s a relationship that I have to teach you a lot from now on, it\u2019s hard for me to do it even if you respect me weirdly. Gakun\u2019s attitude is rather easy-going in that sense, but he still looks like smoke coming out of his head, so it offsets it and is a negative rating.\u201cWhat do you mean Halfis can\u2019t use magic well?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m less apt, and I\u2019m a little above the evaluation criteria.\u201d\u201cMmm. I wonder if it\u2019s the body of magic that the Spirit doesn\u2019t like\u2026 maybe it\u2019s close to me\u201d\u201cDo you have the magic that the Spirit prefers?\u201cFor convenience, I\u2019m just saying that. They say you can communicate all this. You won\u2019t know until the Great Spirit gives you testimony. In the hypothesis at the moment, magical aptitude fluctuates depending on whether the Spirit is doing the magic of his choice. Some magic is not liked at all by spirits, like me, and others are of such a physical nature that any spirits, like Yufi, will like them.\u201d\u201cPhysique\u2026\u2026 can\u2019t I change that anymore?Halfis asks me with his glaring eyes, but I shake my neck left and right to deny it.\u201cI guess you can\u2019t. Magic, or what is the source of magic, fills the soul. I define this as like solid blood. Magic power is zero blood out of your soul, so it\u2019s already unique to that person. I can\u2019t replace this first. I don\u2019t have the means to degenerate it.\u201d\u201cHas Master Anisphere tried that perversion?\u201cHmm\u2026 I guess I would have done it if I wanted to quit humans\u201dIn other words, a familiar example of perversion is Raini, a vampire. If it changes so much from the nature of existence, I might be able to use magic, too. I\u2019m just not sure I can stay who I am with that. Similar bridges were crossed.\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t increase your magical aptitude if you\u2019re not ready for that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can have more in the first place. Because spirits can eat too much magic and get sick. Sometimes when the balance between soul and magic breaks down, it can make your mind and spirit sick.\u201dMarion sitting next to Halfis peeks into Halfis\u2019s face worryingly. Halfis has a pretty thoughtful look on his face, so that complex looks pretty deep-rooted.I wonder if I should be relieved that you relied on me before you stepped off the road. Gakun uttered a voice of doubt when he thought so.\u201cIs that it? But Dear Anisphere, you can use physical enhancement. How is that?\u201cIt\u2019s ready to be used with products like demonic props. I\u2019m just not going to spread the word because it\u2019s risky. It\u2019s inhumane as being forgiven for doing it to yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026 did you even put your hands on that thing?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t use magic unless I get my hands on it. You don\u2019t have a choice. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to let people imitate me. Then I\u2019ll tell them to go down the road to develop their magic tools.\u201dThe engraving was donned to Yuffi. And Ilia, your father and your mother are furious with you. Whatever you are, I don\u2019t think you should treat someone else. Really.So I\u2019ll smile gently at Marion, who\u2019s looking a little pale. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let Halfis do that.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t dislike it, but I don\u2019t know what it feels like to have\u201c aptitude \u201din the first place. What does that feel like?Uffi raises his hand and speaks. The gaze of everyone who was here gathers in Ufi. That was a pretty delicate statement, but I sure as hell never cared about the difference between what I felt when I used Yuffi\u2019s magic.\u201cWhat is it? Not responding?\u201cNot responding, is it?\u201cEven if you chant in prayer or wish, that\u2019s just a word, isn\u2019t it? Even if they put prayer and thoughts on it, it feels like. \u2018Cause how do you tell me to grab something I\u2019m not responding to?\u201cIs that what Anis feels like? What about the others\u2026?\u201c\u2026 not that I\u2019m not responding.\u201dIt was Raini who spoke on behalf of Ufi. Raise your hands with a snack and Raini speaks his opinion too.\u201cIn my case, does it feel like there\u2019s a difference in weight? If it\u2019s an aptitude attribute, I can help if I push it, but if it\u2019s another attribute, I don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it that different?\u201cYes. Somehow the magic street is bad. So they take the magic to activate it, and it\u2019s best to shape it.\u201d\u201cI understand! I\u2019m a similar perception!Halfis snorts heavily at Raini\u2019s opinion. If I was next door, I could have taken those two hands and probably waved.\u201cIn that regard, you were surprised because the magic props are so magical and easy to use,\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s magic that\u2019s been done since the beginning. It\u2019s been in shape since the beginning, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any\u201d extra information \u201cto make it in the form of magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 complete from the beginning? No extra information? Dear Anis, may I ask you a little more about that story!?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ugh, yeah\u201dHalfis has gained a lot of momentum and now he\u2019s eating at me. With a little confusion, I decided to mouth the hypothesis that had just surfaced.\u201cI am consciously making magic props in the form of tools and so that they do not become versatile so that mass production is easy. For example, you have magic that makes blades out of magic, right? All that magic needs is a blade, but you\u2019re gonna have to figure out what\u2019s gonna happen to that blade handle part or something, right? But with the magic props, I even prepared a\u201d sword pattern \u201d, and all I had to do was put out a blade. I could afford to use magic to change the quality of the blade.\u201dBy analogy, \u201cmagic\u201d is a full scratch that can pack as many features as the skill of the surgeon allows.\u201cDemon Props\u201d has been shaped from the beginning and all you have to do is assemble a template.Although magic can change its shape as you wish, it requires the ability of the person.Demonic props have been shaped from the beginning, but there are few parts that depend on the user\u2019s abilities.\u201cI wonder if many who do not have the aptitude should extremes one magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, you have a real example of that\u201d\u201c\u2026 who?\u201cI\u2019m the queen. Master Sylphine has only the aptitude of the wind, but that is the only person who has risen to the top.\u201dOh, speaking of which, yes. If it was in that field, you would have had a mother to call Superman. So much so that they say that if you let the wind magic handle you, no one will go out to the right. I hear other attributes are a tease.Speaking of which, the story deviated from the magic prop, but what\u2019s the magical feeling that Uffi, with his numerous spiritual aptitudes, uses?\u201cHow does Uffi feel about using magic?\u201c\u2026 is it a puzzle\u201d\u201cPuzzle?\u201d\u201cYep. I\u2019m not sure the pieces are set, but should I start by making the magic pieces that I want to complete, and then say it feels like collecting them and shaping them?\u201d\u201cThe feeling of assembling a puzzle even though you haven\u2019t decided on a piece? Not painting or something?\u201cDrawing, is not the same again. It has shape, but do you say it doesn\u2019t? Shape and activate magic\u2026\u201dI\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t know. Unexpectedly, I\u2019ll look at all the faces besides Uffi, but they\u2019re all shaking their necks left and right. I mean, nobody seemed to sympathize with Yufi\u2019s senses.\u201cIn the first place, I don\u2019t know what that puzzle feels like\u201dDon\u2019t look at him with your eyes at strange things, Raini.\u201cOh, but I know it has shape, but it doesn\u2019t. \u2026 I don\u2019t know the puzzle\u201dYou\u2019re failing to try to follow me, Halphis.\u201cI can empathize with gathering\u2026. I don\u2019t know why that would be a puzzle though. Am I a good place, a building block?\u201dDon\u2019t make similar mistakes between fianc\u00e9es, Marion.\u201cMaster Uphilia, something\u2019s wrong with you?Hey, Gakun! Yufi\u2019s hurt and she\u2019s dented! Apologize! It\u2019s surprisingly delicate that you don\u2019t seem to move, Yufi!\u201cUh, maybe it\u2019s a difference in the amount of information\u201d\u201cAmount of information?\u201cFor example, if you add 1 and 1, it\u2019s 2, right?\u201cWell, yeah\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s how magic adds information and makes it. Wouldn\u2019t Yufi be good at sensing that information? Though I don\u2019t know if everyone with a lot of aptitudes does, or if it\u2019s Yuffi\u2019s unique feeling.\u201dIt was an interesting story because I had never looked at the difference in the senses of people who use magic. Let\u2019s keep a note in our minds.Then Halfis, who had his hand on his chin to somehow contemplate, looked up with a serious look. That gaze is directed straight at Uffi.\u201cDear Uphilia, may I ask you a question?\u201cYes, what is it?\u201cHow far can Uphilia make that feeling easy?\u201dUffi tips his neck to Halfis\u2019s question. It\u2019s like saying you couldn\u2019t read the intent of the question.\u201cUh\u2026 briefly?\u201cIf you say it in the sense of Master Uphilia\u2026 can you assemble magic with an unlimited number of pieces of the puzzle?\u201cThat\u2019s possible, of course. For example, there are few pieces of puzzle required for the initial magic that is taught at the college.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! Perhaps what Ennis calls\u201c volume of information \u201cis the number and complexity of what Uphilia calls\u201c pieces \u201d!\u201cYeah. Well, you know what?\u201dThe \u201cinformation\u201d that makes up magic, I guess that\u2019s the \u201cpiece of puzzle\u201d where Uffi says it feels like assembling magic.If it\u2019s simple magic, its terms get easier and easier. The puzzle is not complicated, and the number of pieces is decreasing. That\u2019s a natural story.\u201cI hear Master Uphilia has many aptitudes!\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d\u201cFor example, can you return the same magic as your opponent?\u201c\u2026 if they say it\u2019s possible or impossible, it depends on its magical accuracy, but it\u2019s possible. But the same magic makes a difference with the user, right?\u201cThat\u201c difference \u201dis the magic\u201c unnecessary information \u201d!Continue as quickly as Halfis got excited. Gakun finally sprayed smoke from his head.Raini is also tilting his neck. Spraying smoke like Gakun may also be a matter of time.Marion appears to be lagging in his thoughts with his hands on his chin. She looks just like her fianc\u00e9e to the trick and smiles a little.\u201cThe magic anyone can use is made of natural stories, simple information. If the difficulty increases, so will the information. And magic is built with a sense of the operator. Isn\u2019t that the kind of information you don\u2019t need to get the magic results?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 if you say it from that point of view, there\u2019s even an extra element of what Yufi said about\u201d the power of the surgeon \u201d. Organize the process for generating a phenomenon called magic. I mean, I can optimize.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s no different than a demon prop!?\u201dHalfis says as excited. The word was a shock to me. This kid feels something shiny.\u201cDemonic props are aids to activate magic into\u201d determined shapes from the beginning \u201d! Then, magic, if the user can be fully aware of the aid until it is activated\u2026!\u201cIt does make the theory that anyone can produce the magic they\u2019re after. If they say it\u2019s obvious, yes, but what have you found in pursuit of this obvious? Halphis.\u201dI get interested in what she\u2019s trying to find out by reconfirming this fact.\u201cI have no more magical aptitude or skill than Master Uphilia. Even if you try to make the same magic, it makes a difference between the operators. So can we gather that information and find the\u201d most efficient form \u201d? You don\u2019t just pray, you clearly determine the shape! Yes, fit in the mold! Easier than now, and more elaborate! Wouldn\u2019t Master Uphilia be able to assemble that!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 me, is it?Yufi has her eyes round Halfis telling her to roll it up. I couldn\u2019t stand the laughter coming up next to it.\u201cIf you say so, magic formula,\u201c magic formula, \u201cI guess. It\u2019s also a magical blueprint.\u201d\u201cNow the attitude towards magic in this country is supposedly drawing strength from the Spirit from prayer, desire, and deep faith. That\u2019s why faith and respect are important.\u201dThat\u2019s it, then Halfis shakes his neck left and right as he exhales deeply to get his breath ready once.\u201cBut there is no will in the Spirit if you say so in Dear Annis\u2019s Spiritual Theory. This means that the magic is activated after receiving prayers and wishes with uncertainty. Still, magic activates, so it\u2019s not a mistake, but then it\u2019s natural for the operator to make a difference.\u201d\u201cIf the operator\u2019s perception is going to be magic, I think Halfis is right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we reassemble a clear image. Rebuild magic theory to optimize magic. Simple magic. Easier, so that everyone has a common image. Isn\u2019t that where aptitude and skill come alive for the first time? Even if you make magic like a magic prop, magic is not a magic prop. Because it\u2019s what the surgeon thinks it can build.\u201dControl magic with the perception of clearer laws, not wishes or prayers. The itinerary of doing an image remains the same, but I wonder if I could say that its contents are something else.\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t deny faith or prayer, do I? I think that\u2019s important, too.\u201d\u201cYes! I don\u2019t want to forget to thank or awe the Spirit either! But it\u2019s, it\u2019s this!Look at my face. With a full smile, Halfis says. It\u2019s like a flower blossoms.I\u2019m a little surprised. It absorbs too quickly. The softness and focus of her head, the rotation of her thoughts, have an eye-opening object\u2026. Isn\u2019t this amazing talent?\u201c\u2026 Ufi. Why don\u2019t you just try?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUffi makes a ceremony called magic.\u201c Redesign \u201dthe magic you have now. The blueprint is drawn by Ufi to spread to the country. What do you say?\u201d\u201c\u2026 can I do that?\u201cNo, if Master Uphilia doesn\u2019t do it, who can! If you are the Uphilia, who has been hailed as a rare genius with no example in history!\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny to have Halfis or Marion on that assistant? Wouldn\u2019t the Ministry of Magic say strongly if it was a magic reform? Well, you just have to think about it. Even after I became king.\u201dIf I or Uffi become king, we can get a position to change the country. It shouldn\u2019t be too late for that.I create magic props, and Yufi creates magic ceremonies. That was a fun future prospect if you think it might lead to helping each other with their ideas.Uphilia was wandering her gaze as if she were somewhere frightened. He seemed relieved of the sudden. But it was an idea and a suggestion I couldn\u2019t make. I knew there was nothing I could do about magic.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! What do you mean?!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Gah, are you actually an idiot?\u201cActually, I don\u2019t like to think deeply about anything!Where I say confidently, there!? On the contrary, you\u2019re clean!? I\u2019m dazzled by the smile I showed you my teeth!?\u201cUm, I mean, is it okay that little difficult magic gets easier?\u201cIt\u2019s just possible, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d\u201cHo. Well, you\u2019ve noticed something amazing about Halfis.\u201d\u201cWhat!? Oh really\u2026? I just had a lot of worries about magic\u2026\u201dI wave left and right and humble myself like Halfis panicked at Gakun\u2019s words.It\u2019s easy to say that you may have noticed because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve been sincerely up against magic. Still, I think it\u2019s amazing to listen carefully to people and realize for yourself that it can be assembled as a theory.\u201cTalent like Halfis is what I want\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? What does that mean?\u201cWant to come to Uffi\u2019s assistant? Seriously.\u201d\u201cAre you my assistant?\u201cI\u2019m probably going to be out of expertise over there. Then you\u2019re Yuffi\u2019s assistant.\u201dWhen I said that, Halfis made his eyes black and white and hardened. Marion is gently slapping Halfis on the shoulder like that.Seeing Marion\u2019s face like that, Halfis quickly corrected his residence by gently rubbing his eyes once where he distorted his expression to cry.\u201cUh\u2026 I can\u2019t respond to you if you suddenly say that. And now there\u2019s a king\u2019s life, isn\u2019t there?\u201cThat\u2019s right. There is no clarification of the Spirit Contract, but there are few materials with objective facts that describe the material of the Ministry of Magic\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, there may be\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Marion with a difficult look who answered my blur.\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve already looked through a lot of Ministry of Magic material. You still have it?\u201cNo. If it\u2019s just possible\u2026 it\u2019s forbidden\u201dI frowned unexpectedly at the words Marion uttered.\u201cWhat do you see?\u201c\u2026 a book forbidden by the Ministry of Magic to stay out of national policy, right? Kind of when I was an adventurer.\u201dProhibition that if you go out into the world, you can even be punished. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve read some research material on the opening of vampires, and it\u2019s a forbidden book category. That\u2019s what I got in my adventurer days and read in hiding. Now I\u2019ve already given it to the guild.I\u2019ve heard that if you find out you possess it, you can take it up with the state. Sure, I know it\u2019s possible if it\u2019s a ban, but where do you say you can see that ban?\u201cShall we explore it a little?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI belong to the Ministry of Magic, too. I can\u2019t get my hands on it if it\u2019s burned, but it could be if it\u2019s stored together somewhere.\u201d\u201cI appreciate that, but of the royal family, isn\u2019t that a lot of resistance from the Ministry of Magic if I try to see that?\u201cI will use my position to stand around there\u2026 because I am grateful to Princess Anisphere. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Halfis smile from his heart. Then I want to do what I can.\u201dMarion stares at me with that and a serious look. That was a look that made me feel ready.Still feel hesitant. If you hit him badly, you could jeopardize Marion\u2019s position.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you ask the Knights if I have a forbidden book or something suspicious like that?\u201d\u201cHey to the gut! Or stand up and don\u2019t do that!? It\u2019s dangerous!?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you cunning that all Halfis and Marion are helping! There\u2019s no place for me!\u201cNot from the beginning!\u201cTerrible!\u201dMarion is dismissed anyway, dismissed! I hope you don\u2019t move with such ease that you skip such a dangerous bridge.\u201cWell, well, Gurk. I\u2019m not going anywhere near dangerous, either. Besides, it\u2019s the Ministry of Magic\u2019s job to control the forbidden books. I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get suspicious.\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 but I don\u2019t know\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah. Then I need a favor from Gakun.\u201d\u201cPlease?\u201d\u201cDo you know Navru-kun, the son of the Kingsguard Knights leader?\u201cOh, Master Navre. What\u2019s wrong with Master Navre? I hear you\u2019re in a cage from that one.\u201dYou\u2019re not being prudent, you\u2019re a drag, are you, Navre? Did you set up too much moxibustion\u2026? I\u2019m getting more concerned. And the best people are here.\u201cI was wondering if you could take a look at how things are going?\u2026 Neither Yufi nor Raini wanted to wake that one up. Navre didn\u2019t think about it, but it was Raini\u2019s behavior. I\u2019ve talked about it once, but I thought I might have a chance to start over.\u201d\u201cIf Master Anisphere says so, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cOh, because you don\u2019t have to interfere weirdly! Because it\u2019s just good to keep an eye out for something to flatter you!\u201cOkay!That\u2019s good\u2026. I\u2019m not a bad person, but if Gakun assumes it too, he\u2019s a swine rush. I thought this was your country? I guess it wouldn\u2019t taste good if I didn\u2019t seriously review the aristocratic college education! Really!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51: 51A few days passed after the tea party at the Viscount Nebles\u2019 house. Halfis, Marion, and Gakkun we met at the tea party. This encounter was arguably one turning point for me.Until now, I didn\u2019t want to have friends, but I knew connecting people would be a cut that would expand the world. That means it will be out of reach before.The feeling was even stronger with the information that Marion had brought when she asked the outhouse.\u201cWhat, no library!?\u201d\u201cYes, they have a library where forbidden books can only be accessed by the upper echelons of the Ministry of Magic.\u201dIt was the forbidden book\u2019s whereabouts that Marion visited and informed me. The story is of a secret library managed by the upper echelons of the Ministry of Magic, where the forbidden books collected so far are kept.Knowledge is knowledge, so to speak of forbidden books. And knowing heresy can also help counteract heresy. Therefore, it seems that it was the policy of the Ministry of Magic to seal and manage rather than dispose of it.\u201cIt was managed by the Earl of Chartreuse, who was secretary until recently, and now seems to be between no-one entering and no-opening\u201d\u201cThe Chartreuse family?Oh, is that why the Chartreuse family knew about vampires? Not as a gaga story, but as a forbidden book if it describes the actual situation.Yeah, what\u2019s management? I\u2019m not abusing my authority. If you really beat it, you\u2019re going to get a lot of guilt. I\u2019m going to die and leave you with notoriety.\u201cUm, but I\u2019ve been able to confirm that it exists, but the upper management is holding it back. I guess it\u2019s hard to say I want to see it. Doesn\u2019t it seem possible to shield a king\u2019s life?Marion shakes her neck left and right with a difficult look in my inquiry.\u201c\u2026 I was wondering if Princess Anisphere would taste bad browsing on the boulder. But that\u2019s forbidden under the control of the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201cWho do you think is doing the forbidden book collection?\u201cRecovery\u2026\u2026 is it the jurisdiction of the Kingsguard Knights?\u201cIt is true that the Kingsguard Knights also maintain security in the castle town in addition to guarding the royal castle. If there is a shadow of a forbidden book, you may also come in to investigate. But the main solution is only after something has happened. Before Sole, who is it that brings in information?\u201c\u2026 ugh. Sorry, you have a little clue what Marion is trying to say. Can you tell me the answer?\u201cThere are a lot of merchants and adventurers who bring in the forbidden books themselves and information.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 oh well! That\u2019s what this is about!The Kingsguard Knights are only ready when things happen. Then there are many merchants and adventurers when it comes to informing us of the existence of a forbidden book before things happen.Merchants are less likely to touch a forbidden book than to treat a book as a commodity. Adventurers are implicated in the form of carrying goods that they cannot ostensibly carry, or being hired by escorts when bringing them into the Knights.Once under the control of the Ministry of Magic, it gets harder for me to browse. But there are plenty of opportunities for me to view the forbidden books before that. I\u2019ve seen bans on vampires before.\u201cA controlled ban is not possible, but a controlled ban is possible.\u201d\u201cAs good as it gets\u2026 I\u2019m in a position to have to control it if I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\u201cThe standard for forbidden books is laid down by the Ministry of Magic. In a way, it\u2019s no wonder they think Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic falls under the banned book. I wonder if it is necessary to check with Princess Anisphere to see if the contents are really inconsistent\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a chase. I have a handout for you, so I\u2019ll find out. Thank you for taking the time, Marion.\u201d\u201cNo, more than anything I can do to help. Please be careful.\u201d\u201cAnd Marion.\u201dMarion just left the room, saying there was no use staying long. It would be harder to move in the Ministry of Magic if you thought you were connected to me too much.Prohibition book. I don\u2019t know if I can catch what I\u2019m looking for, but Marion gave me only one idea. I had no plans after this, and goodness let\u2019s move quickly.\u201cYufi, I\u2019m coming down to the castle town for a second\u201d\u201cAre you in Castle Town?\u201cAsk him if he has any information in the Adventurer Alliance\u201dIt\u2019s an Adventurer\u2019s Guild when it comes to my mind. A lot of information gathers over there. I thought it wasn\u2019t a bad option to go talk to him again.\u201cAre you alone?\u201cThe contents are bad. Applicable, because I\u2019m lighter alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t really care, but I get it. We look forward to your return.\u201dSays Uffi with sigh. It can be tricky to have Uffi in a situation where you\u2019re looking for a restraining order. Then you\u2019d better let me move alone.Do you want to go home as early as possible to avoid worrying? With that in mind, I went to Castle Town dressed for sneaking.\u201cAh! Dear Anis!\u201d\u201cFarna, you have a loud voice.\u201dFarna, who had been sitting in the reception seat when she entered the Adventurer\u2019s Guild for the first time in a long time, welcomed me in a noisy way. Stand up in a hurry and Farna takes my hand.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m so glad you could come back\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m retired and I wonder if it\u2019s easy to come here\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true! If you are Dear Anis, you are always welcome!Faluna welcomes me with a laugh with Nico. Now I wonder why Farna missed me so much. I did take the initiative to take on troublesome projects that seemed a little distant to people, or when they stampeded, but I guess that\u2019s something they like so far.Restore your mind, cough up and lurk your voice. You noticed how I was, and Farna sat back in her chair, too, lurking her voice.\u201cFarna, I have a request for you today\u2026 you don\u2019t want to be too public\u201d\u201c\u2026 Master Anis has asked for it, and he doesn\u2019t want to make it public either. Would you like to meet the Alliance Commander?\u201cAre you sure? Chief Guild, you\u2019re busy, aren\u2019t you?\u201cMaster Anis will be fine. Wait a minute, please.\u201dPatapata and I get up in our seats and Farna hastily pulls into the back. Behind the reception there is a door, where is the office of the guild chief of the Adventurer\u2019s Guild of the King\u2019s Capital.It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen the guild chief. He\u2019s usually a busy worker, so he rarely comes out of the office or flies around to negotiate.I guess today was the day I happened to be stuck in the office. I was lucky to think I could follow the crossing.\u201cThe guild chief is going to see you. Go to the Oz.\u201d\u201cThank you, Farna\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dAfter all, Farna, who returned busily, informed me that she had received an understanding. I enter the Guild Chief\u2019s office as I express my gratitude to Farna.The Guild Chief\u2019s office looked like cluttered material was building mountains and some paperwork had fallen on the floor and scattered. A tightly tired man sits in that central office. With a face that makes you feel tired, a dark bear is formed beneath your eyes.My body is limp, but it never means I\u2019m too thin. Rather, the tight flesh gives the impression of a supple cat. Bossy brunettes and neat eyes are also accelerating the cat\u2019s impression, he was such a man.\u201cDear Anis, I\u2019m in a good mood.\u201d\u201cAs always, Guild Leader. Busy?\u201d\u201cThe poor have no free time. Come on. There\u2019s not enough money, life and talent.\u201dThe guild leader floats a laughing style that feels sketchy and ominous. Looks like the same, looking to make money, living dirty. He is therefore a credit for his dedication to expanding the Adventurer Alliance, which cares about talent and helps the welfare of adventurers.And it was originally about nobility. He left the house and is now putting out his daily essence as guild leader for the Adventurer Guild. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true because I didn\u2019t hear it from him.\u201cHmm, what do you want from us? I can\u2019t believe Master Anis is visiting us as a client. Don\u2019t you want to be too public about that either? Hey, there\u2019s a nasty sign. Wow.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the reward is off, right?\u201cMmm. You\u2019re weak for that one word. So, on what request?The Guild Commander asks me what I asked for while making it look like it had slipped away.I\u2019m looking for a forbidden book.\u201cHeh. The princess forbids books!\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is about spiritual contracts. Do you have any idea?In my inquiry, the guild leader narrowed his eyes by keeping his cat-backed back in the chair. Pushing your jaw to think of something, a few degrees.\u201cThere is, if you say so. It just presupposes that you don\u2019t have to say anything else.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no point in saying anything else. Aren\u2019t the terms the same?\u201cMaster Anis has credibility and trust, so hey. Well, there\u2019s something about it because it\u2019s you. Shall I ask and see? Will you give me a moment?\u201d\u201cYep. Let me sit down properly.\u201dI say as I sit on the couch for guests. After seeing that, the guild leader left the room.To wait, the guild leader returned with the sound of a knock. There was one young man on its back. He\u2019s a young man with the impression of being somewhere sad. He looked at me and quietly beckoned me.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201d\u201cGuild chief, what about him?\u201cI\u2019ll catch your eye first, princess. \u2026 My name is Saran Meki\u201d\u201cEh.\u201dSaran Meki? Saran Meki is the son of that merchant who said he stood on Raini\u2019s side in the uproar over Yufi\u2019s betrothal!? I heard he was mistaken, why are you in the guild!?\u201cWhat\u2019s Saran Meki\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Anis protected the Marquis Magenta and Baroness Cyan, didn\u2019t he? Have you ever heard of him?\u201cYou must be a child of the Meki Chamber of Commerce, right? Why are you in the guild\u2026\u201dSaran frowns as troubled and squeals powerlessly at my questioning that puzzles him.\u201cAfter one incident at the College of Aristocrats, I was allotted a house. I didn\u2019t even intend to go, so I\u2019m sweet with the courtesy of the guild manager to let me work here. Behind the back, it\u2019s never on the table\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the son of a former merchant and has an aristocratic education. Organizing and managing your books is no big deal. Few kids can handle the backside\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 so why him?Honestly, there\u2019s no direct contact between me and him, but the cause is deep. That day, Al Kun\u2019s prospects for trying to strangle Yufi for my intrusion collapsed. He was on the same side, I wonder if you have something to think of me.But my concern elsewhere. Saran sits on the couch face-to-face with no hegemony. I\u2019m still young but tired and even make you feel sad for how tired you look. If the guild leader is a black cat, Saran is made to feel strange when he sits side by side in conditions such as a white cat.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Saran\u2019s here. They seem to be after me, so I\u2019m hiding it. The guy who becomes an adventurer also has a backward background. Some guys seem to be only adventurers to live with. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like a guild decision we made for doing that. The implicit decision to protect the Alliance while it contributes.\u201d\u201cI know that, though. I mean, are they after the pattern?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cTo my ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201dSaran tells you in a pale voice with thirsty emotions. Though those eyes aren\u2019t as bad as the guild leader\u2019s, the bear is made and the expression goes hand in hand and I feel darkness.My fianc\u00e9e, the lady in the noble house he was going to marry? Is that lady after you?\u201cYeah, but I heard you broke your engagement on one of the examples.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why they bought it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? You mean human trafficking? No slaves are allowed in the Kingdom of Palettia, are they?There is no such thing as a slave in the Kingdom of Palettia. Slavery is not allowed in the kingdom, although in other countries there are only countries where slavery exists.Therefore, it is outside human trafficking etc. That is prescribed by law, and sin should never be lighter.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you not to speak out, Master Anis. No, it would be nice to say that Master Anis is going to take care of it, but that\u2019s not what makes Saran sad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certainly not ostensibly doing human trafficking. They only send people in the form of good offices.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I heard there were black rumors about the Meki Grand Chamber.\u201d\u201cRight. My father is active in providing support in poor neighborhoods. Establishment of orphanages and good offices for jobs\u2026 orphans can be a good product. Besides, I also do good offices, so I haven\u2019t been exposed.\u201d\u2026 bad chest shit. My eyebrows accidentally came to the limit.\u201cSo you put him up for sale to his son?\u201cMy father wanted honor and wealth. My ex-fianc\u00e9 wanted me. They said it was such a unanimity of interest. That\u2019s why I initially gained the status of a relative of nobility by joining my son-in-law\u2026\u2026. although I was broken off my engagement by buying an unhappiness in one of the examples. You\u2019re a karma guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s the situation, it. Not to the point where I discarded it, but still obsessed with you?\u201cIt was also my ex-fianc\u00e9e who told my father to forgive me. And if you sell yourself, this time it\u2019s going to go to water. That seems to have been the deal. I ran away before that\u2026 but I didn\u2019t think I was going, so I got to the guild.\u201d\u201cWhat, the lady?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you tended to have a strong appetite for exclusivity and self-love\u201dYou\u2019re a very distorted young lady\u2026. Shall we do some research later?So I figured out how Saran was here. I wonder why the guild chief brought him here?\u201cSo how did you get him to associate with me? Guild Length\u201d\u201cBecause he has knowledge of forbidden books.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that true?\u201cPrincess Anisphere, who is royal, may not be familiar with it\u2026 although the knowledge of forbidden books is supposedly not in keeping with the will and laws of the kingdom, some of them are nevertheless useful. Especially for some civilians\u201d\u201cSome civilians? Knowledge of forbidden books is useful?\u201cTreatments for diseases, for example. You may not be able to heal from the medicine alone if you have a terrible disease. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s best to have the magic done, but the treatment costs a lot of money. That\u2019s why people want knowledge of forbidden books. I don\u2019t rely on magic, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any way to do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u201dI accidentally lose my words. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say, but I don\u2019t. If I tell you, I can\u2019t use magic. My situation is similar when I say that I want to rely on magic but I can\u2019t.So it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know that there are civilians who want knowledge of banned books because they are also willing to grab straw. Honestly, it makes me feel complicated. Emotionally, I want to affirm and raise it.But there are feelings that I can\u2019t do better. Even forbidden books can be forbidden for a reason. I don\u2019t think I can affirm that knowledge if it\u2019s going to be an evil law or an outward path. Well, if you tell me you\u2019re doing it if you are, I can\u2019t say anything!\u201cKnowledge lust or driven by necessity? Anyone who asks for a restraining book for a variety of reasons goes on and on. So there are also secretly traded bans.\u201d\u201cIs that among the merchants?\u201cYes, mainly among merchants and millionaires, right? Some, I hear, are also crossed to the aristocracy, but I do not know until the detailed flow\u201dI mean, he said some bans are secretly traded among civilians. Marion\u2019s reading was, in a way, a hit.\u201cSo do you have any idea what the ban is on spiritual covenants?\u201cSpirit covenant, is it\u201dSaran\u2019s voice hardens. The look on his face was frozen and he heard something he shouldn\u2019t have asked.Still, if we don\u2019t listen, we don\u2019t move on, I stare straight into Saran\u2019s eyes. Then he turns away so that Saran breaks.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve been chasing you too\u201d\u201cYou too?\u201cI had decided to join my son-in-law in the aristocracy, but there was no way I could use magic. I was able to join my son-in-law only because of the merits of my parents and because of the funds and profits. So my position will remain low. That\u2019s why I asked for it. If magic can be used,\u201d\u201c\u2026 well\u201dI\u2019m not the only one who suffers from the inability to use magic. Many would want it, if any. If I had the power of magic.Maybe Saran was one of those. I sought magic as a force to change a situation that I couldn\u2019t help.I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have anywhere to think about that reality, but it\u2019s not a good problem for me to talk right now. In a way, I\u2019ve overlooked it. Whether you know it or not, that\u2019s where I missed my eye.All to give the throne to Al Kun. I have pretended not to look at it knowing that if I became wide enough to cross the magic props into the hands of the people, I might be the one to change such reality.So I can\u2019t say anything now. I don\u2019t deserve to tell you that I didn\u2019t do anything right now.\u201c\u2026 so you know something?\u201cNo. Even though forbidden books don\u2019t exist to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\u2026 Empty. The disappointment was huge, just hoping for a little bit.To me sighing, but Saran kept saying the words as he stiffened himself still.\u201cBut I\u2019ve seen one of these before.\u201d\u201cOne sentence?\u201d\u201c\u201d Don\u2019t want a spiritual covenant, \u201che said.\u201d\u201c\u2026 in a forbidden book?\u201cYes, it was an alarm for the existence of the Spirit.\u201d\u201cAlarm for the Spirit?That is certainly an idea that is considered heretical in the kingdom. Whatever you believe in the Spirit, there is no way you can accept the content that incites a sense of crisis to its existence.\u201cI wonder why I wrote such a book. Besides, it said you shouldn\u2019t want a spiritual contract?\u201cYes. I also remember the contents very well. Because it was quite shocking.\u201d\u201cWhat was it about?Saran-kun turned his gaze away from my inquiry at me.And here\u2019s what spinned from his lips.\u201cDon\u2019t forget. Spirit is the world itself. Don\u2019t think you can handle the world. They don\u2019t just carry benefits to people. So don\u2019t want it. Don\u2019t wish. Don\u2019t want it. Let alone hope for a contract or something. If you do -\u2026 you will lose everything. Therefore, O man, do not desire a spiritual covenant.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52: 52\u2013 Spirit covenants make you lose everything.It\u2019s like an ominous prophecy. Back from the Adventurer Guild I\u2019ve been thinking about the words Saran told me.Until now, no information has emerged about the Spirit covenant. Only the one that tells the fact that there was a spiritual covenant even if there was one. Even that fact has nothing but foot-colored and abstract content.I have always been angry that no facts have been left with regard to the Spirit covenant. Too abstract to verify the actual contents.And the clue I finally found was what repelled the spiritual covenant. If that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, it\u2019s no surprise it\u2019s certified as a forbidden book, given the current state of the Kingdom of Palettia.And one possibility floats behind my brain. What if no one left material for the spiritual covenant, not \u201cto leave\u201d it?\u201c\u2026 they thought spiritual covenants were contraindicated?If so, why? When the Spirit covenant makes you lose everything, who the hell left it, with what intent? Saran didn\u2019t have the actual book, and he says it\u2019s impossible to get it. In the end, the truth remains in the dark.This country has treated the Spirit like a friend and like a god who worships him. Then the Spirit covenant with that Spirit should be a proud honor. Even though the story I\u2019ve actually seen tells me that spiritual covenants are great deeds.Then why is the method lost? And forbidden books that warn that spiritual covenants make you lose everything. Don\u2019t ask for it, don\u2019t wish for it, don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s\u2026 why?I\u2019m starting to feel like I stepped into a bottomless swamp. Unexpectedly, I get zero heavy sighs.The sound of knocking on the door sounded as he blurred in a depressing mood\u2026. somehow figured out who came.\u201cUffi, you can come in.\u201d\u201cExcuse me.\u201dI knew it was Ufi.The sky is already dark and it is time for you to sleep. I would have made it look mindless to come back from the Adventurer Guild, and I thought it would come somehow.It took me a while to get my thoughts together. That was all a surprise to me and above all an ominous warning. It\u2019s not an abstract content to compliment, but something that clearly informs me of the crisis, even if I don\u2019t like it, disturbs my mind.Uffi looks at me like he\u2019s worried, and he even drops by my side. I sat down to sit on the bed so Yuffi would sit down next to me too.\u201c\u2026 what happened?\u201cMm-hmm. I had something that looked like a clue, because it was too much content\u201d\u201cDo you have a lead on the Spirit Contract?\u201cYeah. No, there were a few other things I wanted to talk to you about, but it was so shocking that it blew me away\u2026\u201dI can\u2019t ignore Saran\u2019s problems, and this time he helped me out, but I wanted to ask him how he was feeling about Yufi and Raini, about his parents, about his ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t like that anymore.A clue finally found warns me. Somehow I lose it. Even if I don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m going to be heartburned by anxiety that can stir me up.\u201c\u2026 it was a matter of anxiety as to whether it was okay to follow the spiritual covenant as it were\u201d\u201cWas that what it was about?\u201cDo not seek a spiritual covenant. Lose everything, it seems that such a warning was written in the forbidden book\u201d\u201c\u2026 lose everything, lose?Uffi breathes as if he had opened his eyes and ceased. I sigh and look up at the ceiling, too.\u201cThat\u2019s enough to say a contract. It\u2019s not strange if there\u2019s a price for something. That\u2019s what I was thinking. But it was a warning that what I finally saw and came at me would lose everything\u2026. I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s really time to get anxious. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t find a clue in this way.\u201dI still don\u2019t know exactly what this warning means. I didn\u2019t actually see a restraining book with that content on it.Bad timing. Maybe that\u2019s why. But I don\u2019t like to be scratched in the chest. As if you could really lose everything as a price for a spiritual covenant, to the point where it seems so.\u201c\u2026 are you scared?accompany Yufi as he lays his own hands over mine. Close your eyes to the feel of that hand.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m a little unsure lately.\u201dI was like that when I was in Halfis, but thanks. I feel like I\u2019ve been feeling weaker more lately.I wonder if I\u2019m more burdened than I thought by the heavy pressure of becoming king. I didn\u2019t think I was that weak, but lately I feel like I can\u2019t say how I\u2019m doing.The same goes for the spiritual covenant. At this stage, honestly, it is also unlikely that I will be able to make a spiritual covenant. It will then be Uffi who has the potential to accomplish the Spirit covenant.Yet if they give that spiritual covenant an ominous warning\u2026\u2026 it still scares me.\u201cYou\u2019re really sweet.\u201d\u201cKind?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re indifferent to your pain, but you can\u2019t be that way to someone else\u2019s.\u201dI wonder if I can say this is sweet. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m nice myself.Yufi, who was laying her hands over me, holds me. Don\u2019t defy the power to hold me, I\u2019ll be in a position to keep my back of my head in Yuffi\u2019s chest.\u201c\u2026 there may have been something in the past that might have made you afraid of spiritual covenants.\u201d\u201cUfi?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that warning makes a lot of sense, too. Perhaps for a different reason than Master Anis.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that Yuffi also thinks the Spirit Contract is dangerous?\u201cNo. I just think. He said I was too ordinary.\u201dRub Yuffi against my cheek against my head. I feel the strength of my arms holding me tighter.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of anything better than people before. I thought it would be good if it was excellent. To the queen, and to be king, there is no shame in being better than anyone. But I\u2019m too far from normal.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s what? If it\u2019s not normal, so am I.\u201cMaster Anis\u2019s insanity and my abnormality are not the same. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m scared. You feel the distance without interruption. It was a shock, to be honest, especially when Halfis praised me. It\u2019s not normal for me to do what I normally do, but it\u2019s seen as excellent from people\u2019s point of view. There are only things I can do. \u2026 but I wonder what that means\u201dYufi\u2019s voice, which speaks quietly, is pale and comes naturally into his ears.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make you king. But when I fulfilled my spiritual covenant and became king\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I could be king who knows the pain of men.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is it\u201d\u201cMaster Anis will be. You are a man of pain. Magic was born because you know pain well, and magic tools were created. It\u2019s\u201c gentle magic. \u201cIt\u2019s magic for people, assuming it\u2019s used by someone.\u201dMagic for people to use\u2026. Oh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201cI\u2019m not. Something must be different. I can\u2019t really explain how it\u2019s different. But it makes me realize. That\u2019s a distance that opens up beyond interruption. I\u2019m sure that filling this distance is what I\u2019m going to need.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yufi sure is awesome. Maybe he\u2019s certainly not nice. Maybe it\u2019s too good. But that doesn\u2019t lead to the very value of Uffi.\u201dMagic is not everything. Adore, fear, and turn away because the magic is excellent. I\u2019ll never admit that\u2019s all it\u2019s worth.So I don\u2019t want to speculate on Yufi by magic alone. No matter how magically good you are and how far away you are, Uffi is human.\u201cEven Uffi can produce\u201d magic for someone \u201dlike me. I told you, didn\u2019t I? He said we should make it easier to use the magic we\u2019ve had. I think that\u2019s something only Uffi can do. I can handle magic more skillfully than anyone else and be a Ufi who is said to be a genius. Like me, I can imagine gentle magic.\u201d\u201cYes. I want to be, and I want to be\u2026. but that\u2019s because you were there, Master Anis.\u201dRehug Yufi to change my posture. Turn around so you can sit on Yuffi\u2019s lap. Just now, the light of the moon, covered by clouds, plunges through the window to illuminate Uffi.Yufi smiling lightly was too pretty, but she was about to melt and disappear. Unexpectedly reach out and attach both hands to Yuffi\u2019s cheek.Yufi stares at me with a smile. Its light green eyes shake with gentle light.\u201cYou did the magic to me. I must have finally become a wizard from that day on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u201cMaster Anis is really bad at being praised\u2026\u2026 no, you\u2019re bad at taking it. I never took it before, and I couldn\u2019t even look at it.\u201dUffi sighs like he says there are no specifications. I protest when I look at her as if she was a little uncomfortable.Then Yufi turned to his face. In a cuddled position, he was deprived of exhalation to peck for a moment when his distance to each other was zero.Once, twice, if the mouthpiece with the sweet bite that pecks my lips away, I will unwittingly pull my lips together. The heat on my cheeks goes up all at once, and I pull out my strength to keep my forehead without being able to look directly at Yufi.\u201c\u2026 unintentionally opposed\u201d\u201cI want to spoil it, so you just have to be fully sweet\u201d\u201cI\u2019m older, aren\u2019t I?\u201cThen Lord Anis should show more respect to His Majesty and Queen.\u201dSlightly embarrassed and mouthed by the hair. stroke my back so that my holding hand strokes. That\u2019s amazingly comfortable and the force falls out of the core of my body.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cI\u2019m beside you. Whatever the spiritual contract is, I won\u2019t leave you unless I can solve the magic you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So when the magic is solved, you\u2019re gone?\u201cThen call me again. Many times, your gentle magic.\u201dTong, tong, and. I get slapped in the back with the rhythm of my heart tone.\u201cIf that magic can no longer be done. I guess I\u2019m not worth it anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll call you if I don\u2019t want to\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you. Many times, as long as you want me. That\u2019s why I bury your anxiety. I will protect your heart. If you\u2019re anxious, please rely on me. I don\u2019t hesitate to do anything for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 heavy\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s heavy stone. We have to stop the connection so we don\u2019t fly anywhere on our own.\u201d\u2026 Oh and here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. I\u2019ll push your head around to protest.I wanted to tell you I\u2019m here, and I wanted to tell you to stay here. But it\u2019s embarrassing to put it into words. Oh, I\u2019m really no match for you.\u201cDear Anis, Your Majesty is here to see you.\u201d\u201cHmm? Father?\u201dThe next morning. Ilia put in a report at the end of breakfast. The call from your father, what the hell is it?\u201cThey got a response from the spiritual contractor in the example.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dI accidentally took a seat. The fact that we finally received a response may be that there has been some progress in the investigation that was not very responsive at last.I couldn\u2019t contain the feeling of deviation when I thought of it, and with Yufi and Raini I headed fast to my father\u2019s office. As I jumped in, my father sighed, as I had expected.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cAre you here? Though I expected it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious! You got a response from the Spirit Contractor, didn\u2019t you? So how dare you reply!?\u201d\u201cCalm down, just sit down\u201dShow me the sofa for the visitors, me and Uffi sit down and Raini refrain behind. As usual, when we\u2019re in formation, Father sits down in the opposite seat.\u201cThe reply arrived. That\u2019s it, Anisphere. I know we\u2019ve talked about this before, but he\u2019s a different kind of guy than you\u2026 I hate people in the end.\u201d\u201cHate people?\u201d\u201cI hate being involved with people so much. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to say protection to not give it to another country rather than to say that we\u2019re cooperating in this country\u2026 well, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re not trying to help at all.\u201d\u201cAre you that hard of a person?\u201cDon\u2019t be. So if you need help, you can come and see me on your own. I thought you\u2019d say that, but if you visit without contacting me beforehand, I\u2019ll buy you extra frustrations\u2026\u201dUgh, that really feels like I hate muscled people.\u201cYou mean to come and see me in person with that spiritual contractor?\u201cOh, let\u2019s tell him where it is too. He\u2019s in the depths of the Black Forest.\u201cHuh? Do you live there?!?\u201dThe other day, Uffi and I headed to the Great Forest for a stampede. I had no idea you were in that depths.It\u2019s one of the spiritual flocks over there, and they say the more you go to the Oz, the darker the light will be. Sometimes stampede can occur, so much so that adventurers and knights are mobilized in monster hunts on a daily basis.I think I really hate people trying to live there. No, if it\u2019s deep, people don\u2019t seem to lean on it, but come on\u2026\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to meet a boulder in person in the last few years\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to go, do you know where or what?\u201cThere is a special spiritual stone that indicates that he is a messenger. If I had that, I\u2019d be guided my own way. Except they won\u2019t react without that consent.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if I had to go, I wouldn\u2019t have to react, right?\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the boulder\u2026 nooo\u201dWill you stop giving me answers that make me anxious to get ahead, Father? But now that all clues are equal, even the spider\u2019s thread wants to snap. I don\u2019t have a choice not to go.\u201cWell, hurry up, Airdra\u2026\u201d\u201cFool! Are you going to head alone for the depths of the Black Forest?!?\u201d\u201cAh, then take Yufi\u2026\u201d\u201cWith the Duke\u2019s Lady! The two of us, and so on! I can\u2019t admit it!!\u201dIf you were Airdra, you could be in the Black Forest by that day! If I go with a carriage or something, it\u2019ll take longer.\u201cAnd the depths are deep, you have to go into the woods for a few days. We need supplies, we need escorts. Don\u2019t rush it.\u201d\u201cEscort ~ ~?\u201dI accidentally raised my bare voice. Yeah, get in the way\u2026\u201cDidn\u2019t you just think I\u2019d get in the way or something? Hmm?\u201d\u201cI thought!\u201cHmm. You weigh in on the boulder too\u2026 don\u2019t you Shiratora! Don\u2019t interrupt! Something\u2019s up and shipwrecked, and if you don\u2019t come back, it\u2019s important! There\u2019s no way you can admit it!\u201cUh-huh.\u201dWhen I divulged my dissatisfaction, my father caught his eye and stared at me.\u201cIt\u2019s not like controlling stampede! There\u2019s no way I can admit I don\u2019t care how much you know about adventurers!\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I said that and you\u2019re taking my footsteps!The Black Forest is a swarm of spirits and at the same time a habitat of demons. In other words, the woods are full of danger. Knowledge in the woods will be needed, and if strength is a half-breed strength, you can lose your life.Even I like going deep into the woods\u2026 well, not much. Maybe better than the others. I\u2019ve never been lost looking for a spiritual stone. will show you where the dying persuade you differently, Father!\u201c\u2026 if you say so much, you\u2019re the one going into the woods, and Uphilia will still forgive you. But take the escort. You have to let them stay outside the woods. We need to do a search for you when something happens, and we need to put some reward in the Imperial Castle. Not to mention I refuse to admit flying with flying magic props!\u201c\u2026 So, who do you want me to escort?\u201cThat\u2019s what you look for, but it\u2019s good. Let the Knights see their faces. You choose carefully. You can count on adventurers for whatever you want, but don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll do it if I have to\u201dWow, I don\u2019t feel like it. I think we should make it as small as possible. Still, in case you think about searching or contacting the Royal Castle, you can\u2019t make it to that small number.Ugh, I\u2019m heavy. I\u2019m very concerned.\u201cTalk to the Commander of the Kingsguard Knights and see. We\u2019ll need someone who can take care of the escort on the road.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 ok Yikes\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, I won\u2019t admit it if one or two of us jump out. Come on, we\u2019re done talking. Do your own thing.\u201dFather tells me as I wave with a handle that drives me away. I don\u2019t feel comfortable, but I know what you\u2019re trying to say. Guards, I think we need to find them.He leaves his father\u2019s office and moves on to return to the outhouse once. Then Raini called out to me.\u201cUm, Master Anis\u201d\u201cHmm? What\u2019s up, Raini?\u201d\u201cWill you take me with you on this road to the Black Forest?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI have traveling experience, and I think I need a caregiver, no matter how much Anis is used to. So why don\u2019t you take me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t take me into the woods on a boulder, can you?Raini is not extraordinary in magic. Not at all helpless because of the vampire\u2019s abilities, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking her to a dangerous zone called the Black Forest because she was a very ordinary ordinance, let alone a civilian, until a short while ago.Does Raini know that too, staring at me with a nod and a serious look?\u201cYes. That\u2019s something I can tell you too\u2026. If you could rub it with the escort, what would be more convenient if I were here?\u201c\u2026 Raini, that\u2019s\u201dI peeled my eyes off at what Raini was trying to say. Raini is probably talking about the vampire\u2019s mental interference. Although it does use Raini\u2019s power to dramatically reduce trouble on the road.\u201cI know there are fewer people on my side right now to Dear Anis. So am I wrong to want to help you with what I can do?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m glad to hear it, but remember that it\u2019s a means I don\u2019t want to rely on. Which way, the escort has to be chosen. If you could follow Raini as his caregiver, I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d\u201cYes! I need to talk to Master Ilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 not at all\u201dAre you happy to be able to assert yourself now, or should I be jeopardized that I\u2019m going to be impotent?Yufi looked at my face and laughed at Couscous when he thought so. Yes, yes, I\u2019m not, am I? I know, dude!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: 53\u201cI see, Your Majesty is also worried\u201dWe were visiting the Knights on that leg after we left the office after our visit with Father.Although I was going to change the day if I was busy, the Knights of Sprout immediately responded to my visit. Now he\u2019s facing the Knights Commander in the reception room.The Cavaliers loosened their cheeks delightfully when we talked about our situation. It didn\u2019t start now that Father was worried.\u201cBut what His Majesty says and especially what you say. Plus now we should avoid doing things that show a lot of magic power. I don\u2019t like flying magic equipment, but it stands out, so I think it would be a good idea to behave carefully as a royalty.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know that.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m in a hurry. It must be a long wait for Princess Anisphere. But please also take your Majesty\u2019s feelings.\u201d\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here to talk to me?\u201dI say with just a little lip pointy. Honestly, it\u2019s easy to ignore what you\u2019re saying and fly away. I also understand why I shouldn\u2019t do that, so I won\u2019t.Then the chief of the knights began to laugh as he shook his shoulders.\u201c\u2026 His Majesty is also a bad person. If it\u2019s about the escort, we just had a good story, didn\u2019t we?\u201c? Just the right story?\u201cThe other day, Stampede sent additional personnel from the Kingsguard Knights to conduct a regular survey of the Black Forest. I\u2019ve been waiting on His Majesty\u2019s instructions to get ready, but I\u2019m leaving soon. Would you like to accompany us, if I may?\u2026 Oh, I see. Is that what this is about? That\u2019s what you were gonna do from the start!If you\u2019d told me that from the beginning, I\u2019d follow you honestly, Father\u2026\u201c\u2026 both the Knights Commander and Father are bad people\u201d\u201cWell? What do you mean? I will accompany you on that assignment.\u201d\u201cHuh? The Knights leader himself?\u201cYep\u2026. because I think I should vacate the mansion a little bit.\u201dSays the Knights leader with a bitter smile. Uh, maybe it\u2019s about Navre. I wonder if it feels better to keep your distance.For once, I\u2019m asking Gakun to see how it goes\u2026 but I\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m endlessly anxious. I hope nothing happens.\u201cWhen is the departure?\u201cWe plan to be there in two days. If Princess Anisphere is ready by then.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me and Uffi who are going to accompany you, and then I\u2019m going to take Raini as a samurai\u201d\u201cOkay. See you in two days.\u201dIn the end, I kind of feel like I\u2019ve been put on well\u2026. Your father isn\u2019t being honest either.And two days after the promise. I was escorting the Kingsguard Knights to the Black Forest to investigate the Black Forest. If you can fly with Airdra, you can hope for a day trip, but a carriage takes a lot of time.Ask Ilia to be away, me and Yufi, Raini go on the road to the Black Forest as they rock by the carriage.\u201c\u2026 bored\u201d\u201cPlease be patient\u201dThe carriage journey is boring. The speed at which the scenery changes is slow, and nothing can kill time.As far as I\u2019m concerned, he wants to go quickly and enter the Black Forest.\u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you live in a black forest\u2026\u201d\u201cThat did surprise me. There are many demons out there, and if you\u2019re out of the woods, what can you still live in the woods?When it comes to the subject of spiritual contractors, Raini also leans his neck strangely. The Black Forest is still a neighborhood that I don\u2019t think I can live in when I live in it.Maybe that\u2019s why I live there to avoid people, but how the hell do I live? There is no question exhausted.\u201cRaini, is the blood okay?\u201cBecause Ilia gave me quite a bit before I left\u2026. Speaking of greed, it would be ideal if you had it even before you went into the woods\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, nobody\u2019s watching, so suck it. Here.\u201d\u201cDear Anis, don\u2019t be so easy to say\u2026\u201d\u201cEven Uffi isn\u2019t used to traveling, so I\u2019m better at it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t deny it when they say that.\u201dUffi has no choice, sighs as he says. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to starve Raini, and I\u2019m going to expose my wrist and give it to Raini.Raini lowers his head with a forehead and then crawls his lips into my wrist, poking his fangs out. The tingling and pain spreads. As it is, Raini licks the blood out of her obsession. She\u2019s kind of cute like a dog that\u2019s going to squirt.\u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019ve been wondering, does the taste of blood vary from person to person?\u201cOf course not. Rather than taste, maybe it\u2019s a difference in magic.\u201d\u201cThe difference in magic?\u201cYes. Master Anis\u2026 sounds like water. Don\u2019t you think it tastes good? It\u2019s easy to drink because there\u2019s a lot of it.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t taste, hey. I know you have a lot of magic, but does Raini feel like water to you?\u201cShould I have no flavor?\u201cMm-hmm\u2026 I don\u2019t really want to talk about that for a second. It makes me feel weird that people taste different\u2026 and only Ilia, Anis, and Uphilia have ever received blood.\u201d\u201cWhat does Ilia taste like?\u201cTaste is far from expression, or the strength of habit when it comes to how it differs\u201d\u201cThe strength of habit?\u201cYes, Master Anis is the best place to put it in terms of ease of familiarity with your body. Ilia has a habit compared to Anis, but that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cSo what about Yufi?\u201cYou\u2019re full of awesome habits. You get drunk\u2026 that\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d\u201cDrunk, is it?Yuffi tilts her neck in wonder. Is it not so much the taste of blood as the difference in the sense of magic you take in? Then it\u2019s kind of interesting that I\u2019m not as habitual as water and, conversely, that Uffi is full of habits.I\u2019d also like some time to find out about vampires when things settle down. I wonder if that\u2019s the role of the researchers who traveled with Al\u2026. but it only leaves a little lump in my chest.\u201c\u2026 and you can finally meet with the Spirit Contractor.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThat way you might find out about the mysterious Spirit Contract.Me or Yufi? It will be a big cut to determine which one will be king and its course.I can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t think of anything like that. I accidentally look at Yufi\u2019s face.Then Yufi turns her gaze to me, too, and her gaze just fits.That was kind of crazy, and we laughed at each other from either side.I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. Whatever happens, we will.The long felt carriage journey also comes to an end, and the Knights, who reached the town closest to the Black Forest, join the knights who were staying and seem busy replenishing supplies and meeting.I\u2019ll get dressed and ready to go into the woods, too. Yuffi goes under the Knights captain, making sure he\u2019s dressed up for the same outfit and ready.The knight captain who noticed us squeezes his expression and turns back to us.\u201cWe\u2019ll start an investigation based here. Are you sure Miss Raini would like to keep it here?\u201cBecause the Knights Commander is the only one who knows what\u2019s going on with Raini. We\u2019re going back as soon as we can, but thank you Raini.\u201dRaini refrained beside the Knights Commander and had a slightly disturbing look on his face, but grinned to reassure him immediately.She said it would be okay for a while because she drank blood even before she left, but if it became a black forest on a boulder, it was possible that Uffi and I would find ourselves in an unexpected situation. In that regard, I am grateful that the Knights Commander protects me.\u201cPlease be careful\u201d\u201cAnd the Knight Commander.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d\u201cDear Anis, Dear Uphilia! I look forward to your return!Waving back at Raini, me and Uffi head to the Black Forest under the gaze of the Knights Commander.\u201cPreviously on Stampede.\u201d\u201cBecause that was still in front of us. It\u2019s not the same again.\u201d\u201cYou have the Spirit Stone you kept from His Majesty, don\u2019t you?\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve got it in my nose so I don\u2019t drop it.\u201dA spiritual stone that I say is necessary to meet with a spiritual contractor I have deposited from my father. There are measures to be taken that cannot be dropped on boulders.I saw the entrance to the woods while I was talking to Uffi. Deep greens produce darkness that even blocks the light of day as we go to the back.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Uffi\u201d\u201cYes, Master Anis\u201dStep into the woods and the deep forest air will spread all over your lungs. I can hear life breathing. It is the voice of the beast, and the whispering of the trees.I guess I could have said it would be comfortable if it were still near the entrance where the light of day would plug in, but I can\u2019t say that either if it gets darker as I go into the back.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s creepy\u201d\u201cRight. Same as always.\u201d\u201cHas Lady Anis ever been here?\u201cGo find the Spirit Stone. If you go to the back, you\u2019ll find quality spiritual stones.\u201dProceed to the back of the woods as you continue your conversation with Uffi. As the darkness deepens, the passage of time becomes known only by physical sensation.Go ahead and take a break from Uffi and Vertigo to avoid consuming health. As we moved on to the Oz, we began to feel signs of demons as well. There have also been several times when I have been lurking and doing things.\u201c\u2026 but I guess it\u2019s because it\u2019s after stampede. I still don\u2019t feel much.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than anything\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, though.\u201dProceed with the steps to make sure carefully and slowly. Still no response to the Spirit Stone.Just go to the back, go to the back. If you feel hungry, finish an unsavory meal with portable food and put Yufi to bed first where he saw the colour of fatigue because he was unfamiliar with the woods and his turn to watch.\u201cExcuse me, let me say good night first.\u201d\u201cYeah. Slow down, but rest.\u201dIt would be a harsh environment for the Duke\u2019s Lady at the root, but was it still fatigue? Uffi falls asleep quickly.I can hear the woodland stirring. While concentrating on the signs of approaching, I will continue to wait until Uffi wakes up.How long the hell has it been? Uffi opened his eyes, especially since the demon never came by.\u201c\u2026 good morning\u201d\u201cMorning. Are you rested?\u201cYes, Mr. Anis is next.\u201d\u201cYeah, let me get some sleep.\u201dHand the water to Uffi, who still seems to be sleeping just a little bit, to drink it. Drink water to the point of dampening your throat before Uffi shows me the impromptu bunk.It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t feel tired to say how familiar I am. If you lay still and close your eyes, your drowsiness will soon strike you.(\u2026 I hope we find him soon)My consciousness falls to the edge of my dreams as I stroke the spiritual stone, which still has no response.\u2026 For a while, wandering along the edge of my sleep, I woke up with an odd voice.It opens its eyes when it hears a voice as if it is laughing and whispering, as if it has not uttered a word.Then I hear voices apart from whispers. That\u2019s Yufi\u2019s voice. Quiet, singing a song to mumble something.\u201c\u2026 Ufi?I thought, \u201cWhy the song?\u201d I looked at it and I opened my eyes.Yufi is singing. That\u2019s good. However, Uffi\u2019s eyes were out of focus and vain as if he were a sleepwalker.It\u2019s unusual to be singing a song at that rate, and a muttering song is an unfamiliar song. I accidentally shake Yufi\u2019s shoulder.\u201cUfi!?\u201dWhen I grab my shoulder and shake it, I focus my eyes properly like Uffi was hacked.\u201cHuh\u2026? Oh, yeah? Um, Master Anis\u2026?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!? Conscious!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry, it\u2019s a little blurry\u201dHold your face with one hand and Uffi will shake your neck to the left and right. Until just now, Uffi\u2019s condition was unusual. I get worried unexpectedly and measure my pulse, and I keep my forehead together to see if I have a fever.Still, there were no particular anomalies, and the consciousness seemed clear\u2026. I wonder what that was.\u201cMe, I\u2019m blurry and I have memories along the way\u2026 sorry\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t feel just tired\u2026 okay?\u201cYes. I don\u2019t feel any particular anomaly\u2026. What was it?\u201c\u2026 even demons that cause mental interference lurk? If we can move, shall we leave here immediately? Can you move?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine\u201dThen I started traveling to rush Uffi, but oddly enough, if Uffi\u2019s consciousness went to the back, it grew to the point of going.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.At first I also wondered if I was tired or if there were demons that use strange magic. But there\u2019s no sign of that. I feel constant signs of demons, but no sign of them coming this way.\u2026 That\u2019s a funny story too. How can you not encounter demons in the depths like this? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been in the back so far, and even more so, I find it strange to say that it\u2019s after the stampede.\u201c\u2026 Yufi, where did you hear that song?\u201c\u2026 song, is it?\u201cIs that unconscious, too? It\u2019s the first song I mumbled when I was blurry\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I have no idea\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 you have no idea?I mentioned strange things up to Uffi, so even if I try to imitate the melodies I have learned to hear, Uffi just shakes his neck left and right as confused.\u201c\u2026 what is it?\u201cSpeaking of anomalies\u2026 Dear Anis, this is a swarm of spirits, isn\u2019t it?\u201cRight. The black forest is rich in spiritual stones, which paradoxically means there are plenty of spirits.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the voice of the Spirit is loud here. At first I thought it was my fault, but my voice grew louder and louder.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the voice of the Spirit?\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard it so clearly. It\u2019s not a word that makes sense, but it\u2019s got a laughing voice in my ear\u2026\u201dIs that the voice I heard too? So, was that the voice of the Spirit? I don\u2019t really know the signs of the Spirit or the voice\u2026 but can Uffi feel it?\u201cDo you know which way I go makes the Spirit\u2019s voice louder or something?\u201c\u2026 Yes, I think you\u2019ll see\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go a little further into the back. So if it\u2019s going to have a negative impact on Uffi, let\u2019s turn back.\u201d\u201cTurn back\u2026 you haven\u2019t met with the Spirit Contractor yet, have you?\u201cI\u2019m more afraid that Uffi will be unwell. Then I figured I\u2019d go back in alone\u2026\u201dThough Yuffi frowned at her dissatisfaction, she probably feels that her condition is not normal. I have nothing to complain about.And it was when I tried to get back on my mind and move on to the Oz.\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got some funny kids here if you think it\u2019s a little noisy.\u201dMy chest is glowing. If you think of it, that\u2019s because the spiritual stones you kept from your father were emitting light.The voice that has echoed at the same time belongs to the girl. The girl, who showed herself out of the darkness of the woods, is smiling lightly.She has strange eyes with mixed colors and shaking eyes with long platinum hair that seems to cling to her heels. The skin is white by the time it is pathological and doesn\u2019t feel humane overall.\u201c\u2026 what about you?\u201cOh, you\u2019re here to see me, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re Orphans\u2019 daughter, aren\u2019t you?\u201c A rare child. \u201c\u201cThen you are the Spirit Contractor\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWill you not call me by such a long title? LUMI\u2026 Yes, LUMI is good.\u201dThe girl named Rhumi as a pain in the ass shrugs her shoulders. I do not feel that careless attitude is the temperament to try to get in touch with people in preference.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll catch your eye first. My name is Ufilia Magenta. She is the daughter of the Duke of Magenta family. This is His Majesty Orphans, daughter, Princess Anisphere Wynn Palettia.\u201dUffi takes a step forward, as he regained his mind, and goes forward and names him. Lhumi then blinks his eyes several times.\u201cAh. You\u2019re that Grants\u2019 daughter. Hmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you know my father?\u201cTo the extent that we know each other\u2019s faces. Yes\u2026 I don\u2019t have that girl\u2019s daughter. I can\u2019t argue with blood. Hey. It would have been hard to come here, too. This place is special. It\u2019s full of spirits.\u201dLlumi laughs strangely when she dulls\u2026. but young. It can only be seen as much or as little as we do. However, my skin gets poppy. I feel that it\u2019s not what it looks like.I don\u2019t know if this is more about human beings than human beings\u2026\u2026 is it my fault that I feel close to demons?\u201c\u2026 Though I tell you to go home if you\u2019re going to argue?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Are all spiritual contractors as inexperienced as you? It bothers me if I think so. I apologize if I offended you.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u2026 So? He wanted to see me in a letter from Orphans, but what the hell can I do for you?\u201cI want to hear about spiritual covenants\u201dThen the signs of Rhumi, who was careless, turn into even more careless, then rejecting. He has an obvious frown and a look on his face that just says it\u2019s unpleasant.\u201c\u2026 did you come all this way to ask me that? I was wondering if you could come home.\u201d\u201cBecome!? Please wait!\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d\u201c- Is that because the Spirit covenant makes you lose everything?I ask as I step forward to control the panicking Uffi and turn my gaze to the Rhumi to be challenged.To my inquiry Lhumi made a decent face that was distorted uncomfortably, and distorted his expression and laughed out.\u201cOh! Oh! Who the hell wrote that down? In this country? That\u2019s what\u2019s left of it? Oh, forbidden book, could it have been forbidden? There was still something like that left! Look at that, Sang, you came looking for me? Would you be foolish?\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about the spiritual covenant because we just told them what the book was about. I don\u2019t know anything, so I\u2019m here to make sure.\u201d\u201cMake sure. What are you going to do?\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 nothing?Llumi stares at me in surprise. Its colour captures strange eyes as they try to see me.\u201cCertainly I came to listen to you because I wanted to know the Spirit covenant. But if spiritual covenants are harmful to people\u2026 I don\u2019t want anything\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Are you the son of a\u201d rare man \u201d? Don\u2019t you want it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is that rare person?Speaking of which, when you call me, Lyumi calls me a rare child, but I wonder what the hell that shows. If asked on top of each other, Rhumi answers with a stare at me without distracting himself from his gaze.\u201cAnswer me if you want me to. You really don\u2019t want a spiritual contract? Because\u2026 you can\u2019t use magic, can you? Yet a royal child? Then you don\u2019t want it? Because magic is the symbol of authority in this country.\u201d\u201cYou know I can\u2019t use magic because I\u2019m a spiritual contractor?\u201cIf you want me to answer that, answer my question.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I wish I could use magic. But even if you can\u2019t use it, you can be king, and you can create something to replace it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to find out. Whether spiritual covenants are what I need.\u201d\u201c\u2026 be king in this country of habits that can\u2019t use magic? Produce a substitute? Are you serious?\u201cThis is one of those things.\u201dI will pull out the celestial and show it to the Rhumi. With magic, the fullness of light is formed.Llumi, who sees it, turns her eyes round and reveals her surprise. And stare at me again.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s, what?\u201cA tool that only magic can substitute for magic. This is my\u201c magic, \u201cthe magic of using the Spirit Stone without going through the Spirit to mediate. It\u2019s a magic technique. This is only a sword, but with this magic, I also made magic props that fly in the sky.\u201d\u201cLet the sky\u2026 fly? People don\u2019t have wings?\u201cFly. That\u2019s magic.\u201dTighten your chest and tell them. So Spirit Contract is good if you can use it. You can drop me off if you\u2019re in danger. I stare straight at Rhumi to convey such thoughts.He was a rhumi who kept his mouth shut with a strange face for a while, but he softened his expression all the time.\u201c\u2026 as good as it gets. You\u2019re even more unusual in\u201d rare people. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\u201cI answered, too. What\u2019s that rare guy?\u201cA rare man is one who does not have a spirit in his\u201d soul \u201dand does not need it. That\u2019s why the Spirit doesn\u2019t speak to you. I don\u2019t give you magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 have no spirit in your soul\u2026?Unexpectedly my throat rings. I can\u2019t use magic because I\u2019m a rare person with no spirit in my soul?My heart starts pounding when I blurt. Does she know the truth that she\u2019s never been able to unravel? I don\u2019t mind if I think so.\u201cI mean, does that mean that people who can use magic have spirits in their souls?\u201cThat\u2019s right. And magical skill varies dramatically in the width you can use and the upper limit of your power depending on how close you get to the Spirit. This is the identity of the miracle left by the first king of the Kingdom of Palletia. It is not the Spirit who helps royalty and nobility to use magic. Only those who can resonate with spirits all around them can follow them.\u201dRhumi holds his index finger and waves it through the universe. That way the light will be created to follow, and that will be one form.That\u2019s the light that pictured a small person, and the contour of his face is annoying, but he looks like he\u2019s laughing. That will disappear with dew if the Rhumi waves his finger again.\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s that now, Spirit?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Small grain spirits have no will. But if I resonate with myself, gather it and bind it, I can make you conscious. If you subdivide your soul, you can do it like your own, right?\u201cThat\u2019s not like magic\u2026?\u201cThat\u2019s the limit of human beings.\u201dLlumi smiles thinly. As if to mock, she mouthed 'sole\u201d.\u201cThis is the privilege of the\u201d Spirit Contractor \u201d. And the authority of the Great Spirit. The Spirit Contractor and the Great Spirit are not separate. \u2018Cause those two are the same thing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54: 54I was flabbergasted for a moment by the words Lumi told me.Spirit contractors and great spirits are the same thing? What does that mean? Though thought-provoking, I don\u2019t give answers\u2026. No, maybe it\u2019s right that you don\u2019t want to admit it.Still, we have to be sure. Otherwise, we cannot move forward or leave. Pandora\u2019s box is already open. Then I just have to peek into the bottom.\u201c\u2026 to say that the Spirit Contractor is the same as the Great Spirit, isn\u2019t the Spirit Contractor human?\u201cRight? Shall I be more precise? Spirit contractors are\u201d spirits with human vessels. \u201cYou are also right to come together and call a\u201d willing spirit \u201dwith an entity the Great Spirit. But if you trace its origins, you\u2019ll say,\u201d Originally the result of the Spirit Contractor. \u201c\u201c\u2026 no exceptions?\u201cAt least I\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d\u201cSo, what about God? Are you saying that God is human too?\u201cCome on? I don\u2019t know that either. But sometimes the Great Spirit, who became the Spirit Contractor, becomes like God. Paradoxically, I can\u2019t tell you that the activity of the Great Spirit was communicated to future generations, and it\u2019s not possible that he became known as God. I wonder if that\u2019s what a great spirits older than me would know? If you\u2019re still in the world, though.\u201dA rhumi with a distorted smile that caught the edge of his mouth tells him to mock it.\u201cThe Spirit covenant makes you lose everything because the price of the Spirit covenant\u2026 is your own soul?\u201cCorrect\u201dI accidentally bit my teeth enough to get a toothpick.This is why the spiritual covenant did not remain a record until future generations? Yeah, maybe I am. I don\u2019t even think the price is close to such an evil law of my soul.\u201cThat\u2019s just not an accurate interpretation. In the old days, anyway, there\u2019s a different interpretation of losing everything in this day and age. \u2018Cause the spiritual contractor makes a pact, and the spirits are\u201d themselves. \u201c\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? You are a\u201d rare man. \u201cA rare child with no spirit in his soul. But people in this world are big and small, and they have spirits in their souls. And the Spirit greatly influences the formation of self. I mean, like half a body.\u201d\u201c\u2026 a spiritual covenant means a covenant with its inner spirits?\u201cI will offer you my soul as a human being for what it cost you, but the spirits that I give you will not change who you are again.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if that\u2019s all you ask, I feel like it\u2019s just a good thing, but isn\u2019t it?I ask as I look at the Rhumi. Lyumi then leans her little neck with a full ripped grin.\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? But the degree of difference varies from person to person. If you are a soul close to the Spirit, you will have less influence. Like the lady there, for example?Uffi, with his gaze pointed at him, makes him jump on his shoulder to shrug. But it was also in an instant that I showed upset that I immediately asked Lhumi back.\u201c\u2026 Am I close to the Spirit?\u201cRight. It\u2019s my view, isn\u2019t it\u201d critical \u201c? You\u2019re so weak as a person.\u201dYufi is breathtaking at Lumi\u2019s point. Step straight on the dance and step back. I pull such a Uffi hand, try to shelter it on my back and attract it.I noticed that Yufi\u2019s hand was shaking a little and gripped him hard.\u201c\u2026 Yufi is a human being.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m myself like thin ice. Sounds more like a miracle\u2026. Oh, maybe it\u2019s ancestral.\u201d\u201cAncestry?\u201d\u201cDoes the Duke of Magenta draw royal blood, too? Then it is impeccable as the flesh that becomes the vessel of the Spirit. Strange kids. I can\u2019t believe you have a royal child even though you don\u2019t have one, and a child even though you\u2019re not royal. What a chigu.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re familiar with it.\u201d\u201cRight? Because this is still a living witness from the founding years.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cThis is a fact that Orphans doesn\u2019t even know.\u201c Distant descendants \u201c?\u201dDescendants, I accidentally stared at the appearance of Rhumi when I was told. The color of that hair is platinum. The color is very similar to mine, and this color is said to be a testament to the royal family.You noticed the change in my appearance, with a garlic grin, Lyumi tells her with her hands on her chest.\u201cMy name is Lumiel Ren\u00e9 Palettia. The kingdom of Palletia, its first king, its daughter, and the\u201c first queen \u201cerased by history.\u201d\u201c\u2026 daughter of the first king\u2026!?\u201d\u201cAnd the first queen\u2026!? There\u2019s no such thing as a queen in the Kingdom of Palettia!?\u201dWith an incredible name, me and Uffi give a voice of surprise. And I just laughed at Llumi for not saying I was happy\u2026\u2026 Llumiel goes on with the words.\u201cAh. That\u2019s what I forbid to keep in history. It must have been weathered and forgotten.\u201d\u201cHow could you do that?\u201cThat would be a long story. I\u2019ll welcome you, stay with me. You can\u2019t just go home, can you?Lumiel turns his back and goes to the back of the woods. Before we lose sight of it, me and Uffi go into the back of the woods like we\u2019re going after that back, too.Keep heading to the Oz and you\u2019ll get to the wooden cabin. I have some pretty old signs, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to decay in wonder.Llumiel goes in first and the lights light up inside the room when he rings his fingers. It looked like a lamp, but if you look closely, there\u2019s a spirit inside that was shown earlier, and if you look at it, you\u2019re laughed at as a jerk.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s like a witch\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cWitch! There were times when they called me that. I miss you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 can Master Llumiel really be revealed as the son of the first king?\u201cI don\u2019t need a word of respect. I stopped being royal a long time ago. I\u2019m just your distant grandmother.\u201dThere are no chairs or desks in the house. pointing straight over the rug, Llumiel lowers his hips to the floor. Me and Uffi also mimic Llumiel and lower their hips.\u201cWell, what can I tell you from?\u201cThere are so many things I\u2019d like to ask\u2026 is it true that you were the daughter of the first king and the first queen?\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can prove. I didn\u2019t erase the trace of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 how could you do that?Rhumiel shut his mouth once to Yufi\u2019s inquiry. If L\u00fcmiel waved his fingers, the Spirit carried the vessel with flutter. Hand it to us, and Llumiel waves his finger again.Then water born in the air is poured into the vessel. Llumiel likewise takes the vessel and drinks it with water inside.\u201cAs you can see, you\u2019ve been doing the Great Spirit for a long time. This can be a hassle.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s amazing\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s awesome? Yeah, that\u2019s why.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026?\u201cI am the daughter of the first king. Now, I live like that because I\u2019ve turned into a great spirit. So, what about the first king?\u201c\u2026 the first king was also a spiritual contractor\u201dI also drink the water in the vessel and moisten my throat, which I was thirsty for. I can only imagine nasty in the back of my brain.\u201cLlumiel, you\u2026 you didn\u2019t take the throne, did you?\u201cHuh?\u201dUffi\u2019s face as if he had been poked in the void in my inquiry, and Llumiel, in contrast, remains smiling.Nothing Llumiel hasn\u2019t answered. I just laugh like I say that\u2019s the answer. Ask as Uffi has ceased.\u201cHow could you rob me\u2026\u201d\u201cThink about it, Uffi. If Llumiel\u2019s story is true, the Spirit Contractor can go well beyond human life expectancy\u2026. Then why does the first king have to replace him?\u201c!? Well that\u2019s\u2026\u2026 but isn\u2019t it necessary to change generations\u2026\u2026?\u201cWhat do you think? Wouldn\u2019t that be Llumiel telling us the answer?\u201cRight. It\u2019s probably a hit. I\u2019m the one who killed the first king.\u201dLlumiel laughs as she puts her hands on her chest and makes her look proud. I look at Llumiel like Uffi says he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201c\u2026 there was only abstract content in examining the history of nation-building. I was unhappy to leave you, but you didn\u2019t allow me to leave you?\u201cRight. I can say yes, and I can say no. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t me who did it first and my kids who did it afterwards.\u201d\u201c\u2026 did you kill your own father? That\u2019s the king too\u2026?Unbelievable, Yufi shakes her head\u2026. be taught that the First King is a great being for the nobility of the Kingdom of Palettia. But I don\u2019t know who that person is or life is. It\u2019s just that great trajectory is told.I can\u2019t believe the first king of honor was murdered by his real daughter. And it\u2019s really hard to believe that her daughter is the first queen to be erased from history and now she\u2019s right in front of us like this.\u201cBelieve it or not, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d\u201c\u2026 assuming that\u2019s true, you killed the first king because you were\u201d immortal, \u201cunlimited?\u201cYou\u2019ve been very calm, haven\u2019t you?\u2026 Yes. First king, your father was perfect. He had the spirituality to cast himself aside for men, and obeyed the Spirit, and God prepared him as he did. He was an ideal king, just like the one he painted. But the king was only the king.\u201dLlumiel changes his mocking look and tells him to stare away somewhere. That also resembles a gaze at someone who\u2019s no longer there, and there\u2019s no disdain there.Rather, I was able to read warm emotions that could even be described as dear. It\u2019s really important and still makes me feel like I\u2019ve let go of it.If that\u2019s meant to be directed at the other person who killed him with his own hands\u2026 it must be a story told in the name of tragedy.\u201cFather gave up all his soul in a spiritual covenant. And obeyed the Spirit, and became a signpost for those who suffered in their plight, and were worshipped as kings. Just to save people, to protect the country. I admired myself and kept reaching out to those who believed. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s become.\u201d\u2026 You can\u2019t call me human if you\u2019ve gone that far already. It\u2019s a \u201cking\u201d. I can only say how \u201cking\u201d works.A \u201cking\u201d who abandoned men to save them. A selfless savior who reigned with immense power. Good if that\u2019s the existence of the story. But that selfless king of salvation has certainly become real in the person who made his name in history.\u201cMy father made a proper inheritance, didn\u2019t he? Because it is the King who does so. But my father is not old, he does not fade, he does not change. He continued to reign as just the immutable, the supreme king he wanted\u2026. eventually even the people will be so fanatical. Eventually, it changed as much as it wanted to rule the world.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so you killed the first king\u201d\u201cYep. It was then that Father was not\u201c the king who saves the plight of the people \u201d, but only\u201d the king who fulfills the desires of the people \u201d. The good king, whom he desired for his people, was turned into a tyrant by the desire of a people like no other\u2026. What do you think if you put this in history? Should I call him the Demon King?\u201dhold his stomach, rhumiel says, laughing in a queasy manner. It also looked like a madman, but it only seemed to me that I could keep myself by behaving that way.The covenant of the Spirit made him the good king that the people desired, and it turned him into the evil king by the desire of the people. Give me my soul as a man until I do it for my people. And at the end of the day it became the receptacle to the desires of the people, and it was the existence and the fruit to be discussed.It was my daughter who took it. Oh, it\u2019s a tragedy that\u2019s not really rocky.\u201cIn terms of results alone, I killed my father and took my country and became queen. And my father, me, and the Spirit disappeared by promising not to make matters in history about the covenant. I haven\u2019t been queen in less than a year. That\u2019s not even history.\u201d\u201c\u2026 and your child is our ancestor.\u201d\u201cYou will. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let the kid have the spiritual contract. I lost the way, too. It will affect your soul, but eventually it will fade by staying in touch with people. You didn\u2019t have to make a deal with the Spirit. You still had the power to be a nation. And the kingdom of Palettia began to walk in the true sense\u201d\u201cYou had a partner when you had kids, didn\u2019t you? Is that person\u2026?To my inquiry L\u00fcmiel shook his head quietly beside him. Give me a pale smile, not a sarcastic look.She seems very loving, but hung up. You look careless, but proud. With such a complex look to remember, she says.\u201cIt was he who inherited the country as the\u201d son \u201dof the first king\u2026. that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t know how my kids grew up either, by the way. It\u2019s the last thing I held when I was a baby.\u201d\u201cOh no\u2026\u201dYufi is biting her lips with an unspeakable look. If this were true, we would have found out behind the glorious history of the founding of the Kingdom of Palettia. What a headache.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even reveal it to your father, did you? Why did you reveal yourself to us?\u201cBecause the child was about to reach a spiritual covenant. I wonder if I\u2019d be interested in you later. So we\u2019re still gonna make it, right? What kind of spiritual covenant is a man so chopped up that he inadvertently returns to his ancestors in our descendants and is born near the spirits to stop people? That\u2019s the only thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Could there have been more\u201c rare people \u201dlike me back in the day?\u201cNo, rare people are rare people. A rare one who can live without being sheltered from this world. It doesn\u2019t stand out in the Kingdom of Palettia, but there were a lot of kids in other countries who took names as greats.\u201d\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t it true that all civilians are rare?\u201cThat\u2019s not why\u2026?Oh, no. Then why isn\u2019t there a spirit soul in me\u2026!Are you telling me it\u2019s caused by memories from a previous life?\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you how impossible that is!?\u201cRare is rare, but you can\u2019t use magic because it\u2019s unfavourable from birth, or inferior\u2026?\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the\u201d unbelievable. \u201dBut the\u201d rare man \u201cI\u2019ve seen has accomplished what has been called the impossible. There\u2019s nothing magical about it.\u201d\u201cI wanted to use that magic!\u201cThough I use spiritual stones for magic, which is the business of spirits, I think it\u2019s so much more awesome to create them in the form of tools\u2026? And flying in the sky what? Where did that idea come from? It\u2019s like a rare beast.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me a rare beast!What a rude ancestor!\u2026 I know exactly what Lumiel is all about. If this is true, it tastes so bad that I can\u2019t tell you who I am in a detour.If such facts are to be brightened, the foundation of the faith of the Kingdom of Palletia can be shaken. I don\u2019t like people whose faith is biased, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it would be good to be doomed.\u201c\u2026 spiritual covenant means covenant with your inner spirits to exchange your souls, right?\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it? What exactly are the after-effects?\u201cThere are differences in degrees, but the human body is no longer anything more than a\u201d vessel. \u201cI guess I should just say I\u2019m going to lose my sense of being human. If it\u2019s horrible, you can replace emotions, thoughts, desires with spiritual soles.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so we lose everything. Does that mean joy as a person, life?\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Cause you\u2019re gonna be a spirit. The future as a person is lost instead of gaining power. We can\u2019t get old, we can\u2019t go through time together, we just stay the same. None of this distracts me from maintaining the vessel. See? You\u2019ll lose everything eventually, won\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 No way, Llumiel was the one who left the ban on examples?I don\u2019t know.I was deluded by a grin I wasn\u2019t sure what I was thinking.But I\u2019ve learned about spiritual covenants. Neither the reality nor the price of the contract may have been left as knowledge.Right now, I think I\u2019m getting a hard look. Then Yufi also stared at Rhumiel with a serious look.\u201c\u2026 Lumiel, how much will the price be for someone with a soul close to the Spirit?\u201cIf you\u2019re asking about your daughter herself, I guess it\u2019s not so much the same as\u201c who I am now. \u201cSeems like your ego as a person is initially thin, and I guess the Spirit is familiar with people\u2019s senses a lot. And it hasn\u2019t even precipitated itself as a spirit. It\u2019s like a work of art, and if you were to lean on the spiritual side of it, you wouldn\u2019t feel the big price.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re losing it just because you don\u2019t feel it, right?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cMan and the Spirit are another being from the ground up. Isn\u2019t\u201c confusing \u201cenough?\u2026\u2026 I have been pushed to silence by Llumiel\u2019s words. Different thoughts come to mind, disappear and repeat, and thoughts do not come together.Did Uffi have the same thing or did she shut up with a serious look on her face? Look at us like that. Rhumiel gives her shoulders a whisper.\u201cAnyway, rest here today. There\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201dI was looking up into the sky with my hips on high tree branches to sum up my thoughts.The forest covered by branches is dark and the lights are indispensable at hand. Still, I don\u2019t even feel like staying at Rhumiel\u2019s residence, and I\u2019m getting blurred out here.I\u2019m worried about Yufi, too. For my part, I thought I had to get my thoughts together by the time I talked to Uffi. That\u2019s all the truth surrounding the Spirit covenant was too shocking.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t think there was such a good story.\u201dNot much, no matter how much.What is the honor of the First King? Its first king quit man in a spiritual covenant, and on top of that he turned into a monster that looked to conquer the world. By the way, it\u2019s not even a joke that my real daughter would kill me. I just want you to be in that kind of creativity.And the sprouts of the possibility that I could use magic also crushed. Llumiel says \u201crare man\u201d. A soul without a spirit in its soul. I can\u2019t resonate with the Spirit because I don\u2019t have the Spirit. I can\u2019t use magic.If resonance becomes magic, I know it. \u201cEngraved\u201d engraved on my back for me. This, if I may say so, is not a soul, but an engraved on my flesh. In the end, the spiritual covenant is no different from the engraving. That\u2019s just the difference between carving it into a vessel called flesh or a vessel called soul.\u201cOh, my God, then magic is not evil.\u201dIt\u2019s just a glorious feat, so they just believe it\u2019s the right thing to do.But the essence of magic is no different from the invention I created in my magic. In particular, it is extremely similar to engraving. It\u2019s not crap.\u201c\u2026 snap into boulders\u201d\u201cOh, what snaps?\u201cHiya!?\u201dI feel like I\u2019m losing my balance because of the signs I suddenly felt. It was Llumiel who supported that body.Soon she was \u201cfloating\u201d behind me. She sat next to me laughing strangely.\u201c\u2026 if you want to speak up, give me a sign.\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m sorry\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?It really hits Lumiel hard. I feel terrible about it.\u201cI wanted to talk to you more, uh, Alice?\u201cNo! Anis! Anisphere!\u201d\u201cIn anise, then. I can stay in the Ryumi, too, okay?\u201cOn your own, Llumiel\u201dIt\u2019s not cute.Don\u2019t poke me in the cheek, don\u2019t be nervous! I look at it unintentionally, but it doesn\u2019t look familiar at all.\u201cIf you mean the Great Spirit, give me some more majesty.\u201d\u201cIt would be convenient for someone like that, wouldn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201cYou must be an ex-human!\u201cSomething I don\u2019t remember being raised as a human being. I am royal. I think you know what that means.It was an abominable response. I stare at Llumiel with such a grin, hateful enough to want to bite me by accident.\u201cHeh heh, you grew up pretty depressed. Well, if it\u2019s this country, I don\u2019t know what else to do? You didn\u2019t abandon your country much. Or destroy the country.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not like you\u201d\u201cRight? You\u2019re human, I\u2019m a spirit. I just took people\u2019s vessels.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a human being.\u201d\u201cWhat I wanted to be was a fact.\u201d\u201c\u2026 even though you were born as a person? You were a father who wasn\u2019t even Roku, the first king.\u201d\u201cEither it\u2019s the mother who\u2019s not Roku, or maybe it\u2019s not the surroundings. Even though my father recognized me as a child, that\u2019s all. There is no major obstacle to the\u201c operation \u201dof the country. Maybe a spare for when something happens to me, a pawn for diplomacy?\u201cNot good enough.\u201dOh, really. There is no royalty. I thought so from the bottom of my heart.\u201c\u2026 hey, what\u2019s a spirit?\u201cOh, that\u2019s abrupt.\u201d\u201cAnswer me, Great Spirit\u201d\u201cThe Spirit is a zero shard itself from the world. Nothing more or less.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s\u201d God \u201dwho created the Spirit?\u201cThe great will that created us, I would say. I wonder. Is there still a God in the real sense? Some of the great spirits called\u201c God \u201chave seen each other face to face.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what does Rhumiel think? Do you really think there\u2019s a god?\u201cI think he was.\u201d But it\u2019s not enough. Or you\u2019re not willing to do anything. \u201c\u201c\u2026 unwilling to do anything?\u201cIf there is a God, don\u2019t you think the Spirit will change the world as God wills? The light and darkness of the Origins created by God, and the subspecies spirits, beginning with the four great spirits elephant from the world. None of them would try to\u201d exchange something from themselves, \u201cwould they? Isn\u2019t that God\u2019s will?Llumiel makes sure to look further afield and talk pompous.\u201cThere were times when I was touring the world, looking for a being called God. I just never really met the God of Genesis. If there is a supernormal person whose existence as God truly portrays the law of the world, what is man born for and what does he live for? I wanted to throw that question at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re not looking anymore? Did you find the answer?\u201cI told you earlier. I\u2019m not here anymore, or willing to do anything. God or not, this world doesn\u2019t change. The Spirit does not change either so that God does not change. It is man\u2019s prayer, desire, and desire itself that always changes God and the Spirit. That\u2019s magic.\u201d\u2026 Is the faith of the Ministry of Magic also wrong in a way? But the destination is not happiness as a person. Happiness as a Spirit.So you shouldn\u2019t bind the country with that idea. Because we are human beings. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being human even if you can\u2019t use magic. Until we abandon being that person, to the Spirit, um, man is not weak enough that we have to drown in our own prayers and wishes.\u201cPeople don\u2019t live for magic. It\u2019s good to work really hard and pray when you can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t want to tell you that it\u2019s a mistake to be saved. But giving up before that and drowning in prayer is\u2026 unacceptable\u201d\u201c\u2026 boulders, rare people. Every rare person I\u2019ve ever seen looked like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 does Rhumiel know more about rare people?\u201cI can tell, to a certain extent. It\u2019s easy to understand because you don\u2019t feel spirits.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you don\u2019t have any traits or anything? For example, you have memories of a previous life\u2026\u201d\u201cYou ask strange things?Llumiel looks at me with an astonishing look. I don\u2019t think I have any idea.\u201cYou seem to be even more unusual among rare people. I\u2019ve never heard of you having memories of your past life. But everyone has been innovative. In that sense, you can\u2019t leak into that example either. As if that\u2019s the messenger of God.\u201d\u201cThe messenger of God?\u201cYep. Nature and they arrive as if they were on a mission, to do what they have to do. And sometimes even if you risk your life to accomplish it. There is no miracle there called magic. Even if it is only possible to come by as an escort, magic will not take shape without prayer. He who stands as the leader of men and paves the way\u2026. Are you obvious about that?\u201c\u2026 I wonder why someone with magic wouldn\u2019t take the initiative. Even though I have the power.\u201d\u201cA soul that contains the Spirit can also be described as a soul that cannot be formed without prayer. I mean, you don\u2019t have enough\u201d glow \u201din your soul as a person. You guys don\u2019t have the will of a rare person.\u201dTong, and is touched to be pushed in the chest with a finger. That\u2019s how Lumiel floats is a smile of mercy.There I saw other colors of envy that I would miss.\u201c\u2026 could your partner have been a rare person?I\u2019ll leave it to your imagination.Cover it all up with laughter, and Llumiel won\u2019t talk. Like saying that\u2019s the answer.\u201cBeing a rare person doesn\u2019t make me happy. Nor does it say that a soul full of spirits is unhappy. Everything is a living result, what do you feel at the end of it? That\u2019s everything. Is that why you\u2019re not going to disparage that young lady?\u201c\u2026 Yufi is a sweet good boy\u201d\u201cSounds like it. She\u2019s a real miracle. That kid shouldn\u2019t have enough soul power, but he can maintain his physical appearance as a person despite being a spirit of spirituality. You don\u2019t have half as much mental power.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was saying.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a general theory. I mean, that kid\u2019s out of standard again\u2026. I envy you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 envious?\u201cIf only that child\u2019s strength were on my father, even a fraction. I wonder what happened to me.\u201dLlumiel\u2019s hand reaches out to my head. The gentle arrangement that combs my hair is like a mother for my child. It makes me touch nature, and I don\u2019t think I hate that.Even though I have no certainty, I\u2019m convinced this man is my ancestor far away. It\u2019s not rational. As if this body is what this soul remembers.\u201cLet\u2019s go back before your body gets cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok\u201dSo I could snort nature into the proposal. Llumiel\u2019s face, smiling softly, was so human that she didn\u2019t think she was a person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: 55The area around Llumiel\u2019s residence is creating a very strange sight, as the Spirit lit the lights for me. I don\u2019t feel the light of day is dark even in the distance, and I feel as if I have strayed into the world of dream stories.The figure of Uffi, who reaches out to the Spirit and nestles in such a view, seems like a single picture. Speaking up was also a hesitant beauty, but I\u2019m also anxiously driven by the fact that if I don\u2019t speak up, I\u2019m going to disappear as I am.\u201cUfi.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, dear Anis\u201dSpeak up and Uffi will look back at his consciousness this way. I have myself relieved by that trick alone. After all, is it because I have just learned about the spiritual covenant and the history of the Kingdom of Palletia that makes me anxious?Llumiel was just back inside his residence, and it was just me and Uffi here. Shoulder to shoulder without saying anything to each other in a strange sight.I have to say something, but still I can\u2019t get the word out. Tell Yufi I want to hear something, but what I want to hear doesn\u2019t take shape. It was just Yufi who opened his mouth first as time passed.\u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises and speechless.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m glad I found out.\u201dPeek into the side of Uffi. Quiet, serene face everywhere. Straight eyes as if they had identified a distant goal.\u201cWe had to know correctly, we\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did Uffi already sum up his thoughts?\u201cYes. A spiritual covenant is not a good thing to want lightly. Not to mention what you want in order to be king.\u201d\u201cYeah, you are. I think so too.\u201dI think that the king born of the Spirit covenant will certainly be the king that the people desire. It has immense power and binds prayers and wishes to make dreams a reality. That is rightly the ideal king.But the king is not human. A king cannot be a human being at a time when he no longer wants it or embodies it. I can only live as a king. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I should want either.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sure public opinion will crack if we release the truth about the Spirit covenant. Some will admire it as wonderful, others will repel it as terrifying.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s no different than being afraid of Ennis\u2019 magic. Both the spiritual covenant and the achievements of magic are worthwhile and both have aspects to fear. So I think what we need to do is to know the right thing, teach it not to be bad, and guide it.\u201dUffi turns his gaze on me. Quiet, but staring at me with a strong willed eye that cemented determination.Soft everywhere, seemingly tender everywhere. With a smile so as not to get lost, Uffi continues his words.\u201c- That\u2019s why I want to fulfill my spiritual covenant to be king\u201dI held my fist to the proclamation Ufi told me. He bites his lips in agitation and looks back at Yuffi\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026 I thought I\u2019d say that. I wonder why. I get it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAre you going to be \u201cStill\u201d? You\u2019re saying it yourself, aren\u2019t you? A king born in a spiritual covenant can be a human pillar. If a person does not know the truth, they are just praised, and if they know the truth, they cause fanaticism or fear. You know how sad it is to abandon people to be kings for people?\u201cYes. This may be a retrograde, stupid imitation of the times. But I think I need it.\u201d\u201cYou think I need that much? Do you really need a king like that in this country?\u201cYes. I need it. So I\u2019d like you to hear my thoughts until the end, Master Anis.\u201dUffi lifts my fist, gripping it hard, and adds his own hand.\u201cI also think it\u2019s a fall to abandon being a man to be king for a man. Surely a king is a king. But I don\u2019t think we should be abandoning people.\u201d\u201cIf so\u2026!\u201cBut who knows that correctly? You can\u2019t say that a new king can\u2019t be set up if someone believes that glory of the past is the right thing to do, if they still believe that, right? That\u2019s why we can\u2019t just let go of the reins right now.\u201dContinue to pray as Uffi closes his eyes with his forehead.\u201cI will be the last king to receive a crown under a spiritual covenant. And end the old days correctly.\u201d To tell you that an alternative to the miracles accomplished by the Spirit\u2019s covenant is about to come into being. \u201c\u201c\u2026 Uffi, but that\u2019s why\u201d\u201cSpiritual covenants and magic are all in the hands of men. We should be entrusted. In the future, there will also be kings who desire magic, kings who want spiritual covenants. I think we need to embrace all the possibilities, so that we can choose, not force.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the cornerstone of a milestone in your time? Sacrifice yourself?\u201cIf someone has to exchange it, let me hope and shoulder that responsibility. Not that someone wanted it, but at my own will. Not for the people, but for the new era I want.\u201dGently, Yufi\u2019s hand, which was holding my hand, can accompany my cheek.\u201cIt is up to me to inherit everything from the old days. If you pass it on correctly, you can\u2019t tell people. To put an end to an era of prayer, desire, and mere service to the Spirit. A future where people choose out of their own will and power. And for the first time, magic makes ideas shine. From me to you. From the past to the present, and to the future. It is the past, the present, that takes over all of it and shows the people a new path. That\u2019s the future I want my country to walk in.\u201dIn old times, the history and thought of the Kingdom of Palletia, built by spiritual covenants, all of faith.Surely Yufi would be right. It is undoubtedly Ufi who is closer than anyone else as the symbol that has taken over all of it. Yuffi, who is said to have a soul close to the Spirit, has the gift to reach the Spirit covenant, and inherits the righteous blood of origin, deserves it as a symbol.End the ancient times with Uffi becoming the last king as a symbol. And into the next era, show a new outlook. To defeat the existing concept, it becomes the symbol that bears the concept and ends it. That must be an ideal story.\u201cSo you say you can quit being human? You said you could carry it? In the past, to show those who believe blindly that it succeeded? Just to show that I\u2019m not on the right path!?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have that kind of care, I can change my country!\u201cYes, Master Anis would be able to. But a radical reform would be contentious. You will carry that responsibility to the point where it hurts. Just carry the pain of ending the old days all by yourself. I can\u2019t forgive that.\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to admit to sacrificing Yufi!No matter how close Uffi is to the Spirit, Uffi is human. I was born a human being, but I just can\u2019t admit the stupid story of having to throw that away for the sake of my country.I really don\u2019t want to make a sacrifice. I can\u2019t help but make a sacrifice as a result. If the idea is different, it will be contentious, and there is no choice in that. But it\u2019s definitely different to swallow if you have to give up from the start.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t think of it as a sacrifice?\u201c\u2026 yes, this is my very own. I just didn\u2019t know I had to because I was born that way. I don\u2019t want Uffi to carry his country until I let him quit.\u201d\u201cThen this is also my very own. But if that\u2019s what you were born for, if there are people who can be saved for it. That\u2019s me, too. That\u2019s what I\u2026 want. For me, and for you I love.\u201dYeah, it\u2019s a really parallel line. It\u2019s like mirroring up to where they don\u2019t want to be no matter how far you think of them.\u201c\u2026 you think you can convince me with the discussion?\u201cNo. I won\u2019t give either, and Master Anis won\u2019t, will he?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. \u2018Cause if you really don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll shake it all off. But I\u2019ll make it happen. That\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll be the one who stops it.\u201d\u201cYou think you can stop me?\u201cYep.\u201dYufi smiles and gently distances herself from me. And look back slowly and face each other again.\u201cI recognize the value of magic. Above all, I\u2019m by your side, and I know the possibilities. But \u2013 yet, I win.\u201d\u2015\u2015\u2026\u2026\u201cI have to win. We still have to match that value. Otherwise, magic will betray you again. The magic that makes people smile, I guess that doesn\u2019t really come true with current magic. Because if the Spirit has no will, magic is only a mirror of a person\u2019s wishes. If that magic keeps betraying you, you can only abandon the magic and destroy the world and move on. Then I won\u2019t let you. Let me build a new era of magic.\u201dPull out the arcane shell that Uffi was sitting on his hips. Touch the body and then point it at me.\u201cEnd of the old days. Give the country a new era. Happiness to many people. Our wishes are the same. But what the country wants today will be magic, and there\u2019s no way to give that lead to magic yet. It\u2019s only after I take over and finish everything.\u201dAs a sign of the strength of his will, Yuffi\u2019s eyes have eyes full of determination.\u201cAlongside your magic, I stand next to you with the magic you had to give up. So if you don\u2019t acknowledge the way you\u2019re doing it, and you don\u2019t give in\u2026 let\u2019s settle with each other\u2019s\u201c magic \u201d. Now is not the time for you to lead the way.\u201d\u2026 nature and my hand was also stretched out to celestial. Set up a celestial pulled out of the sheath to take Uffi\u2019s gaze head-on.\u201cSooner or later your time will come. I will build and show you the times you want. I want to see those times together\u2026\u2026 \u2013 I grab that right.\u201d\u201cNobody sacrifices. I don\u2019t want to. Even if that was Yufi\u2019s wish, I would not allow people to be dumped for their sake. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re just dreaming next to me, Yufi.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to stand next door. \u2026 you say what you wish to protect. I could only protect it by breaking it. I want to show that magic isn\u2019t just that.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t protect it, there\u2019s no point. Then destroyer, but I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cThen I can\u2019t admit it.\u201d\u201cOh, really\u201d\u201cYeah, really.\u201dIt\u2019s with joy. It\u2019s with sadness. It\u2019s anger. And above all, it was a happy emotion.Deny each other\u2019s wishes, but we are as happy as we wish each other. But it\u2019s a different shape, so we bump into each other.That child who reached out to me that day is in a position relative to me and takes care of my wishes above all else. That\u2019s why I have to face it.\u201cAny complaints about losing?\u201cI won\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dI took your word for it.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u201dLaughing at each other. My heart is at peace everywhere. There is no cloudiness. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019m not lost. It\u2019s all in the way.So my heart is clear as a blue sky. I\u2019m sure this will be laughable at the end of the day, no matter what.\u201cShall we begin?\u2026 Is this a fight? Or a duel?\u201d\u201cNo. There are more worthy words\u201d\u201cHeh? What\u2019s that?\u201cLet the magic comparison begin, Master Anis. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I told you! Genius, lady!Each other\u2019s magic is expensive and full of surroundings. I felt like the forest had gone out of its way to ring to it.The wind blows between us, and the leaves of the trees in the wind pass between us.The leaves of the tree tear in two. In the next moment, the sound of my celestial and Uffi arcane shells meeting each other\u2019s blades echoed in a squeamish.Deep in the Black Forest, its magical comparison was unwittingly feverish.In a square made in the deep woods. So facing each other are Anisphere and Uphilia. They slash each other with their demon swords over and over again.Anisphere quickly approached Uffi without striking a blow as she strengthened herself with the magic poured from the dragon\u2019s engraving. Bouncing it back with physical enhancement so that Uffi can respond again.Play each other\u2019s swords, draw almost the same orbit and overlap the swords. The sound of the sword trident does not linger, but accelerates as it sounds tall.(Huh, it reacts\u2026\u2026! But I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re coming head-on!This development was, to be honest, unexpected for Anisphere. When it comes to Uphilia, he\u2019s a genius who uses a lot of magic. Then I wonder if they will come using their magical hands. It comes at me as if it suits me.That seemed surprising to Anisphere. What are you thinking, are you after something? If you get past the back of your brain, your attacker will be dull. It\u2019s not hard to imagine an imminent magic chase even if you show a gap. That is why it becomes an outfit to respond to the onslaught of Uphilia.(Dear Anis reacts fast. I would be inferior to the battle just for physical strengthening. \u201cThat\u2019s why\u201d I can\u2019t use a detoured hand\u2026\u2026!Uffi doesn\u2019t misunderstand his talent. Indeed, the magic I use is diverse and the choices float multiple ways. But if you\u2019re going to use it for anisphere, your options will be narrowed down.Anisphere\u2019s hands are not as diverse as those of Uphilia. That\u2019s why every one of them is highly proficient. Fast, sharp, heavy. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t get the hitter wrong. For Uphilia, it was a battle as if stepping on thin ice.Fact is, I can\u2019t even get a moment out of my mind when I\u2019m slashing knots. If I loosen my mind at all, Uphilia will feel it even if her demon sword strips away her fangs. My body is so feverish that I can clearly see that the sweat that floats is telling my skin and falling off.(Now I have the upset I showed unexpected movements, but in local power I\u2019m inferior. Any one adapted and pushed down\u2026\u2026!It is the image of one\u2019s defeat that floats in Uphilia. Destroy, destroy and destroy images overshadowed by instantly floating anispheres. To connect the remaining possibilities, the reflex nerve will be increased to the maximum and the accuracy of body strengthening will be increased.There won\u2019t be a decision to make. Still needed to buy time. Anisphere also has better experience in action. So there\u2019s only one thing Yufi can do.(Give me everything I can\u2026! What I can do, no, even what I couldn\u2019t do, is extremely visible here and now\u2026!For Uphilia, magic is the task of shaping scattered pieces. Through magic activated once, scrape off excess and attract and reassemble what is missing.Formation, scrutiny, optimization, filling, reconfiguration and execution. Uphilia\u2019s thoughts turn visibly. Every time I feel a pain in the back of my head. Blood gathers in the back of his eyes and his vision turns bright red.The breath rises and the body complains of fatigue. The arm that repeats the spear is about to lose its senses due to impact. Complement it with a body strengthening woven with healing magic. That way, the magical path of further physical strengthening is drawn in the back of the brain while reducing body fatigue.Uphilia instantly reassembles the magic she is exerting on herself as she pulls the feeling that something is going to burn out in the back of her brain.\u201cAhhh!!\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201dThe sword flashes that Yufi swung out, raising his own surprising beastly voice, surpass Anisphere\u2019s predictions only for a moment. Only with each other\u2019s momentum antagonizing, Yufi\u2019s modulation breaks Anisphere\u2019s rhythm and lowers as Anisphere steps on a dance.Uphilia doesn\u2019t miss that gap. The distance to the slightly open rear, set the arcane shell to pull the bow, utilize the twist of the body to release the poke. Just before releasing that thrust, the wind swirls like a helix.\u201c\u201d Windstorm! \u201cThe magic trick is sweet, and the conditioning setting is sweet in the aggressive configuration. But the wind released at the same time as the thrust accelerates its thrust, causing it to reach the realm of divine speed.The aim is celestial. Play that one. The moment Yufi\u2019s thought came, Anisphere \u2013 let go of the Celestial and stand low.(Huh!? Shima \u2013 Huh!Celestial misplaced targets dance through the universe and climb up. Uffi\u2019s body, which released the poke, is stretched. Hit the palm bottom into Uffi\u2019s abdomen so that the anisphere, which stood there low, sprained its bent knee.Yufi\u2019s body is bounced off with momentum. Roll as you jump on the earth several times, and rise as Uffi kneels down to kill its momentum.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!Uphilia can experience vomiting that is likely to throw up all the contents of her stomach. Even the cushions created by the wind magic cannot offset the blow of Anisphere. Let\u2019s just say they didn\u2019t take the bones. Good.There is no pursuit of the Anisphere. Anisphere also holds the celestial in her hand again and wipes the sweat that flows down her back with her hand.(Does it change this far in action? Genius, or not a monster, Ufi\u2026)Past Anisphere is yet another fear of Uphilia. It was felt on the skin that Ufiria was instantly, reassembling magic on the spot.That was also very similar to the process of sharpening the blade. Fast, sharp, scrapes away waste. Like Uffi approaching herself with one step and another every time she exchanges her sword. If this were truly a life-taking, I would have been under the illusion with the footsteps of Reaper.\u201c\u2026 ha\u2026 ha\u2026!Breathe and stand guarded, Uphilia looks at the anisphere. Anisphere doesn\u2019t seem to have relaxed either.Anisphere stands in front of me. In that, Ufiria had unspeakable emotions in her heart. It speeds up the heartbeat and spills blood all over your body.(Choice is crushed. So much\u2026\u2026 even with so much means, there are fewer hands to choose from. This is Master Anis\u2026\u2026!Seems to repeat, in terms of plenty of options, Uphilia outperforms Anisphere. Diverse magic can only help. That was the strength of Ufiria. It has always been so. That\u2019s why I never cared.When I saw the magic, the countermeasure came to mind. It wasn\u2019t even hard to offset. Even a sword could be treated more than a crowd. The experience of choices being \u201ccrushed\u201d beforehand came as a surprise to Uphilia. This is my father, Grants, who has never felt the end of a magic trick.(I wonder how much this one has worked out. How much to reach for what you can\u2019t reach)I want to fly in the sky. The path of Anisphere, which began there, can be described as exploration itself. I have come to know magic, to know myself, to fill what is missing, and to refine my strengths by being foolish.In contrast, Uffi has never challenged her exploration. A variety of magic can be used from the beginning to grasp and offset the hands of others. Absolutely at birth, that was the way she was.But Anispheric obsession breaks down Uphilia\u2019s almighty. The almighty feeling that I relied on without realizing it myself doesn\u2019t work for anispheres. During this short stagger, Uphilia felt so bad.That\u2019s why \u2013 Uphilia\u2019s heart grows strong and expensive.\u201cI want to line up\u2026\u201dI want to see the same view as you, who look away everywhere.I want to change who I was just to stay in what I was given. I don\u2019t just want to be who I am, I want to walk through this world instead of staying in it.I\u2019ve always thought it was best for me to behave the way I wanted. I am not asked to be there. Then I didn\u2019t feel the need to ask for it either.The hand offered when that premise collapsed and the previously normal world collapsed. The light I saw ahead of me is nothing more than an anisphere.I was told that this soul was spiritual. There is a world, but stay. Then do as you wish. It was just to make it good. But I can\u2019t be. It won\u2019t end this way.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u2013 I want to beat this guy.What do you want to win? Uphilia clearly doesn\u2019t know that.So at least I won\u2019t run away. I want to be on the same stage, with the same eyes, just keep facing each other.I don\u2019t want to be alone with someone who\u2019s going to shake everything off to get to where it needs to be.And I don\u2019t want you to leave yourself alone, where everything was complete.I want you to see it. I want you to admit it. When I\u2019m here. Each other, everything is chipped out.That\u2019s why. I just want to be the only one for this guy.\u201cI won\u2019t let the king\u2026\u201dA king is a symbol in itself, for the sake of his country and for the sake of his people. If you become king, that freedom will be lost.I didn\u2019t like that for Uphilia. The Anisphere was free so we could get there. Yet I cannot accept that everything must be dedicated for the good of the country, neither its freedom nor its deprivation, nor its wishes, nor its merits.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t approve of Ufiria. Even if that\u2019s what the world wants, it\u2019s unacceptable.Oddly enough, it was like Anisphere who didn\u2019t admit he couldn\u2019t use magic. Uphilia steps out again, too. Forward, forward.\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cI will not admit that you will be sad to be king. I can\u2019t bear to have something to lose from you by becoming king. It\u2019s wrong for you to dedicate what you\u2019ve built to no one else, just for everyone\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cStill, if you say that\u2019s my responsibility, I will. Until I make someone unhappy, I can\u2019t wish for my happiness.\u201d\u201cStill, I want to make you happy. I want you to laugh, I want you to be free. I want to keep your wish.\u201dSo you don\u2019t have to be king. Many times Uphilia screams like that.\u201cIf we\u2019re all going to be happy \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to be happy too.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 I won\u2019t admit that Uffi is going to be unhappy!\u201cDon\u2019t you decide my misfortune!\u201cDon\u2019t let Uffi decide my happiness!\u201cSo you don\u2019t like it!? Don\u2019t you like me trying to be happy!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s cowardice!Mouth it like Anisphere was upset by the unexpected pursuit.That\u2019s why Uphilia turns back. Tell them to remain emotions similar to the anger that boils in their hearts.\u201cIf you wish everyone happiness, accept your happiness too\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m happy enough already\u201d\u201c- I\u2019m saying I\u2019m not happy with that!I want it, I want it, I want that guy\u2019s happiness.That\u2019s what I wanted. I want it stronger than anyone, my darling\u2019s happiness.And I say, \u201cEnough.\u201d I don\u2019t need it anymore, I say. That\u2019s not true \u2013 I don\u2019t know anymore. Did you find out?\u201cI\u2019ll be happy on my own and unhappy on my own. I don\u2019t admit that. So if you say you don\u2019t want everyone, I\u2019ll take it. Dear Anis, you can throw it away now. If you say you don\u2019t deserve a king, you can throw it away.\u201dI\u2019ll take the crown.Uphilia\u2019s thoughts are conveyed without words. Anisphere takes the stand as he decides.The light green colour of the anisphere diminishes. Eyes like a golden moon. It\u2019s the first eye I\u2019ve ever seen from the front. The change in color is due to the magic of the dragon. Those eyes are as beautiful as gems.Likewise, the blade formed from the celestial also shows a change. Crystalline blades with thin rashes and blue. The light, reminiscent of the silhouette of a dragon wrapped around his whole body, frightens the beholder. This presence certainly deserves to be called a dragon.\u201cWords don\u2019t convince me. I can\u2019t. \u2013 Then you can take this!? Now if you want to leave!? I won\u2019t forgive you if you die, and I will resent you for life! Even I don\u2019t want to give in! I don\u2019t want Yufi to go down the path of absolute suffering!\u201c- Oh, then you\u2019ll never lose.\u201dI didn\u2019t have a reason. I wasn\u2019t sure I could beat it. Still, Ufiria spoken naturally.Anisphere pulls her lips together as she hesitates. Looking at Uphilia as she stared, she jumped to momentum.A blow that reminds me of the blue sky falls above heaven. Uphilia grips the Arcane shell as a flashing blow approaches that repaints the faint sky into the blue sky.This blow can be defeated by half-breed magic, but it cannot be prevented. Make an immediate decision. Even the footsteps of death are close. Still, there was no stray, no starvation, no fear in Uphilia\u2019s mind.\u201cGather, mix\u201dI had a tip.\u201cMix it up, get it done\u201dReplace the magic of your body. That\u2019s the secret Anisphere uses when exercising dragon magic too.\u201cIf you do, you are equal to the world.\u201dReplace \u201cMagic\u201d. It was the spirits around them who invited them to call water at the price of their whole body\u2019s magic.Gather around your whole body the magic that comes from mixed spirits. Uphilia controls the forces as wild as torrents, while thoughts fly by the shock.Inject that magic into the Arcane Shell. The Devil\u2019s Sword, which had Uphilia\u2019s function as a magical aid, shows change as it responds.\u2013 A rainbow crystal-like blade is formed.That shines in response to the magic of the Spirit that Uphilia has taken in.A Spirit is a shard of the world itself. The blow that Uphilia draws out, which can resonate with its Spirit, is a strike that reminds me of a rainbow, as is the name of its demon sword.Extreme light reminiscent of the sky overlapped with a sword flash of extreme light reminiscent of a rainbow, bouncing each other.I saw a rainbow.I saw a beautiful, very beautiful rainbow. Beautiful sole with bridges in the blue sky.But when I opened my eyes, the light of the Spirit lit up. It was in a faint forest. I wonder if the beautiful view I just saw was illusory.I felt soft behind my head. Then it was Yufi who came into my sight to peek in\u2026 Apparently I was being knee-pillowed.\u201c\u2026 are you awake?\u201c\u2026 Ufi? Me\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me. I had the best shot at offsetting the blow, and I didn\u2019t even think about the fall. After that, Mr. Ennis fell out of his head.\u201d\u201c\u2026 fell out of your head? Ah\u2026\u201dMemories come back. A special blow by Celestial, who defeated Fenrill. When I let that go, I remembered that I was jumping up in momentum.Uffi, who intercepted it, is on the ground and remembers a rainbow blow imminent as he launched. My memory is broken there.I\u2019m probably out of balance in the air and fall straight out of my head. And I think it means I passed out. I don\u2019t have a headache for that, and I think Yufi treated me.\u201c\u2026 it was so beautiful\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I saw a beautiful rainbow\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s the light of the Spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well, that was really beautiful\u201dI accidentally lost my power. I exhale at the odd fullness as I leave my head with Uffi.\u201c\u2026 my loss.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a draw. It was just bad luck.\u201d\u201cUgh, it\u2019s good to lose. I really thought it was beautiful from the bottom of my heart.\u201dI was admitted to losing because it was just beautiful.I thought if I lost, I would definitely regret it. I hate to lose. I still feel a lot of regret.Still, I was distracted by beauty. Reach out and touch Yuffi\u2019s cheek.\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026 a little lighter\u201d\u201cUnusual. I can\u2019t believe Uffi can illuminate\u201d\u201cThe magic is unstable right now\u2026 it\u2019s kind of fluffy\u201dWith a bitter smile, Yuffi blushes her cheeks and shows them. That was adorable again and I laughed unexpectedly.You really are a complete loser. At least on this occasion. I couldn\u2019t help but lose in the battle I wagered the king.\u201c\u2026 oh, already. Don\u2019t let your regrets shrivel.\u201d\u201cYes, because whether you win or lose, you have nothing to lose. And because I regret dying if I lose, and I\u2019ll probably cry. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to lose.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I might want to see Yufi\u2019s crying face for a second\u201dWhen I said that, Yufi laughed at me like I was in trouble. Then Yufi gently crawls her fingers through my lips.\u201cI\u2019m sure when I\u2019m king, I\u2019ll cry even if I don\u2019t want to. Just in front of you.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWill you forgive me?\u201cI forgive you. Crying, taking away from me, everything, everything.\u201d\u201cI want to make you happy. Forgive me for that, too?\u201c\u2026 fool, don\u2019t ask\u201dI try to turn that way because I was embarrassed and I was about to bite my tongue. Then Yuffi\u2019s hand suppresses my cheek, and Yuffi\u2019s face looms.It takes my breath away. If you reach for breath to drown and hold it tight, you will be dropped deep enough that it is likely to become acid depleted. I won\u2019t let it go easily when it gets painful and I punch Yuffi in the back of the head with pessies. By the time I was liberated, my head was totally cracked.\u201cPfft\u2026. this, kissing demon\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean\u201d\u201cToo frivolous!Are you listening to my protest or not? All Yufi did was smile contentedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: 56\u201cOh, you\u2019re back? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been having a fancy fight.\u201dThat\u2019s what Llumiel told me when I went back to Llumiel\u2019s residence with Yufi, who laid down his hips on the floor. The teasing attitude hasn\u2019t changed and he looks at us curiously.We sit back in front of Llumiel so we can face back. It was from Uffi who cut the mouth fire.\u201cRhumiel, I\u2019d like to ask you to teach me about spiritual contractors. Will you not give me that wisdom?\u201cHmm? Stop being so human. But you want to be king?\u201cYes, otherwise the throne is far from me, and the dream I want to accomplish will not come true unless I become king\u201d\u201cDreams, hey. What the hell do you want to achieve?\u201cHave a new era. \u2026 I want to put an end to the lessons of the old days correctly in order to take over from Ennis to a new era.\u201dLlumiel stares at Ji and Yufi. Its mixed colored eyes reflect Uffi. Uffi takes that gaze head-on without being frightened.Then the colour of Llumiel\u2019s eyes shows a change. It returns to one color so that the mixed colors blend together. Its colour is deep blue, reminiscent of the sea.\u201cI once destroyed my father, who became king of madness as the people wished. I can\u2019t say that you\u2019re not going to be one of those two dances. Yes, I\u2019ve been bound to the end of a spiritual covenant\u201c a wish that would otherwise not be fulfilled \u201d. Face the Spirit who dwelled in you, pursuing only its essence, and shredding away everything\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. that\u2019s why I want to be the last one. We may not be able to shed light on all the facts and truths, but people still need to know.\u201d\u201cKnow what? Knowingly the people may seek a new sacrifice. Who can tell you not to ask God for a convenient king? There are truths you shouldn\u2019t know.\u201dClose your eyes and Rhumiel tells Uffi. I feel signs similar to quiet anger. The light behind my eyes is shaking as if the pale flame were shaking.\u201c\u2026 Llumiel. You may be surprised now, but please ask.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I knew.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLlumiel looks like he\u2019s been taken aback. I accidentally opened my mouth and watched Uffi too.Uffi stays flat and keeps spinning his words pale.\u201cIf you want to seek God, you can do so. That\u2019s not what I found out. Because I haven\u2019t said a word about becoming a god. I will be king, but that consists of me wanting to be. It\u2019s not like I want to be someone\u2019s god, and I don\u2019t need to hear what you have to say. If you don\u2019t like it, you can set up a new god.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ufi?That? Yufi was such a freaking kid to say!? Oh, but I might say\u2026? Was this what I looked like when I was a student\u2026?\u201cI just don\u2019t recommend it as a national teaching. If you want endorsement on that, you just have to prove it by your own deeds. If that is to be the voice of the people, if you want it from me, then it is time for me to leave the kingdom without having to take over. So if you want to be a god, let\u2019s give it back.\u201c Did you know that? \u201c\u201c\u2026 did you find out?\u201d\u201cThis country has already been saved. I can\u2019t figure out how things were in the past, either, but I certainly don\u2019t have a chopped crisis. The people live healthy and the nobles are filled with wealth. It is also all due to the reign of a man who is not God. At the earliest opportunity, we don\u2019t need God in this country. Yet seeking God, etc., and that seems to me to be the extreme of decadence. Why should we reach out even if we shelter such a people?\u201c\u2026 does that mean trumpeting a people who want God?\u201cNo. It\u2019s not worth dealing with, that\u2019s all. You can ask for it if you want. So if you call the country a disaster, it is a rebel. If I had seen the tragedy and yet sought the danger of inadvertently seeking God, I would never have seen the deed done.\u201dYufi ran out of words to be nothing and moved her gaze to me.\u201cPeople can pursue happiness without having to rely on God. I have learned from Anis that it is possible to build a new era that is impossible. It is then that I will be the representative of the former king to guide the people. The old days will end with a king named me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 some people think you\u2019ve been betrayed?\u201cBetray? What? Expectations? Then you just have to accomplish it yourself. The Spirit will respond if you pray. If that wish is sincere, let the path of the Spirit\u2019s covenant be paved by itself.\u201d\u201cSo what if a spiritual contractor was born that didn\u2019t do it for the people?\u201cI will defend my country with all my might.\u201dLlumiel has silenced himself in Yufi\u2019s response. And distorted my lips. There was a loud laugh from his lips.Rhumiel is laughing down to the point where his breathing becomes painful as he holds his belly. After laughing out to the point where she was a little worried, Llumiel corrects her posture as she wipes her fingers with the tears that floated.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cDid I say something so strange?\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so\u2026. Oh well. If you want to be happy, be yourself. That\u2019s the new era you want.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if that\u2019s the\u201c essence, \u201cyour daughter will be fine. You will never step off the path like my father, nor will you ever be like me. You should stick your chest out and go back as a spiritual contractor.\u201d\u201cThank you. Now I\u2019d like you to teach me how to do that spiritual covenant\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm? Aren\u2019t we done already?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cTo?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u2026 silence falls. The three of us looked at each other and we became silent.\u201c\u2026 are you done?\u201cHuh. I\u2019ve already finished my contract with the Spirit, young lady\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice?\u201c\u2026 Specifically, how do you exchange contracts?\u201cIt\u2019s an exchange of magic. At the price of his magic, he receives his magic by manifesting the manifestation of the Spirit, a mirror that goes hand in hand with the Spirit within him. So a great spirit is already born in your daughter\u2019s soul. I think I can feel the signs if I\u2019m conscious. Besides, we\u2019ve been talking for a long time, haven\u2019t we? You look better than you did when you got here, don\u2019t you?\u201cWhat!? If you think Yufi is alive enough just now, it\u2019s the effect of a spiritual covenant!?\u201dI\u2019m circling my eyes like Uffi surprised me. He wasn\u2019t conscious at all. Speaking of which, it\u2019s like he said the magic was restless and fluffy or something.Was that when the Great Spirit was born within him and the magic was replaced with the usual magic, he didn\u2019t calm down?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t have any particular sense of change.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you. Originally, he said he was spiritual. It\u2019s not that different.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but it changes, doesn\u2019t it?\u201cOriginally, spirits don\u2019t have flesh. That\u2019s why I tend to be greedy about what I want. That\u2019s more than you can handle. Of course, my father, many spiritual contractors hide in some distress where their temperament is not understood by the people around them. The longer you spend, the more uneven you\u2019ll feel with people.\u201d\u201c\u2026 become greedy\u201dHey, I think Uffi saw me all the time. I had a bad feeling that I couldn\u2019t help but look at that instant and shook my body for the first time.\u201cIf it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s case, that seems to have meshed well. How hard did your parents hurt you? I don\u2019t think I feel the same way about my weakness as a human being as a spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is this a place to rejoice?\u201cWell. It\u2019s up to you to decide that, from me.\u201dLlumiel laughs as she flaunts her shoulders. Yufi doesn\u2019t seem to be an interpreter, but he\u2019s convinced for now.\u2026 so I was listening to Lumiel\u2019s explanation and could be a little concerned.\u201cLumiel, I\u2019d like to ask you one thing\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 can a spiritual covenant do something similar to a demon?\u201cHmm? I\u2019ll ask you a strange question. I think a demon with a demon stone in his body can theoretically do it. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe Spirit becomes a match mirror for a man\u2019s wishes, but the demon is what lives by instinct, isn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re not a demon like that, you can\u2019t get to the point where you can make a deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026 like a dragon or something?\u201cRight. Anyway, if it\u2019s a young dragon, if it\u2019s more dragons than Cheng Long, isn\u2019t it possible?\u201cWhat if? If something similar happened to the Spirit Contract, would we stop being human after all\u2026?\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such an example.\u201dI don\u2019t know what that means, Rhumiel tilts his neck as he says. Then Yufi\u2019s jittery gaze pierced him from next door.\u201c\u2026 what if I told you that the real example was me?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 what?I decided to give an overview of the engraving to Llumiel with my eyes rounded.Llumiel, who was half-hearted at first, also tested me in surprise when he actually saw my engraving. And I said this as if I were frightened.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201cI\u2019m going to be sane myself!?\u201d\u201cThen a rare fool, I wonder if he\u2019s a genius\u2026 Oh, don\u2019t worry. While it is true that your engraving, it is also grossly similar to a spiritual covenant to exchange demon stone magic for your own magic, it is only temporary. You can\u2019t stop being human if you don\u2019t accept it completely. Just\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 just?\u201cYou\u2019re so fond of me. In the meantime, if I accidentally become a dragon, I\u2019ll point it at you and laugh at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I mean, there\u2019s a lot of potential for you not to be human.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s less likely than a spiritual covenant, but you can\u2019t say you don\u2019t. You\u2019re the only one I know.\u201dI think I\u2019ve been told far away that I\u2019m an idiot with no precedent. I thought it might be something like that, but could it be a dragon\u2026Something is itching on my back. It\u2019s like being laughed at by an engraving. What, even if it\u2019s will, it\u2019s still there, this\u2026 let\u2019s go over it properly, let\u2019s do that.\u201cOh, you\u2019re really delightful kids\u2026. Yeah, I made up my mind.\u201d\u201cYeah? He said he decided\u2026 what?\u201cShall I return home too for a long time? There\u2019s no shadow left.\u201d\u201c\u2026 eh!? Are you going to come to Wangdu!?\u201dTo Llumiel\u2019s words I opened my eyes and revealed my surprise. Is Uffi surprised, too, staring straight at Llumiel?\u201cFunny kids like you don\u2019t always show up in the future! Besides, Uphilia is already one of my countrymen. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be helping you with that?\u201cThat helps\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t the world of men painful for you?\u201cOnce upon a time. But you\u2019re gonna build a new era, aren\u2019t you? Then maybe it\u2019s why I survived so far.\u201dThat\u2019s what I say and smile. Llumiel cuddles us in.I don\u2019t even feel like shaking it off somehow, making Llumiel want to keep it that way. Did Uffi feel the same way about me, and the time passes for the three of us to turn ourselves in just like that?This is how we were brought back to the King\u2019s Capital as spiritual contractors and our distant ancestors, Lhumiel.If I went back out of the woods, Raini greeted me with joy as if I were a ho. The Commander of the Sprout Knights was with him, but when he saw Rhumiel, he opened his eyes like a ghost.\u201cLord Lumi!? Why are you out of the woods?!?\u201d\u201cOh, Matthew\u2019s boy. You\u2019ve grown up, haven\u2019t you got any more Orphans escorts?\u201cHow many years do you think it\u2019s been since then! Boy, I want you to stop!\u201cReally? Hehe, I came out of the woods because I liked Anis and Uffi. I\u2019m going to see what happens to these kids for a while. Is it disrespectful for someone who\u2019s not even a nobleman to want to enter the castle?\u201cSomething like that! Queen\u2026 Master Silphine will be delighted!\u201cOh, that\u2019s the horse girl. Maybe that heartless thing got a little better.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.The two people whose conversation bounced to warm up their old relationship left early if they didn\u2019t put in a report to Father as well.Raini prepared dinner to relieve the fatigue that was diving in our woods. Though not as luxurious as the outhouse, it was a heartwarming meal. So I explained to Raini what was happening in the forest.So, you\u2019re sure you got what you came for?\u201cYep\u2026. I will push Yuffi to the king. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to tell your father.\u201d\u201cReally?\u2026 Congratulations, Master Uphilia\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks\u2026. Raini, will you support me from now on?\u201cOf course it is. It\u2019s not what they say.\u201dRaini laughed at Couscous and responded with pleasure. You must be tired, so I was told to rest on my bed for a long time.I look up at the ceiling as I fall asleep in bed and my thoughts circle. But it doesn\u2019t feel real and fluffy as a cloud.\u201c\u2026 oh, you really don\u2019t have to be king\u201dThere seemed to be a hole in my chest. I even felt like something that had been tied up and suppressed all along somewhere would be solved.Is that pleasant, regrettable, or vain? Anyway, I can\u2019t get my emotions together. I\u2019ll put my hand on my forehead at this rate for a while.\u201c\u2026 this is what Raini said, you should rest early\u201dI guess I\u2019m tired too. I knew a lot of things, and I showed the way.All you have to do is push on. Me too, for what I want. If Yufi is building a new era and expecting me, I can\u2019t lose either.The sound of a knock echoed where I tried to close my eyes to try to renew that thought from tomorrow.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Master Anis.\u201d\u201cUffi? I\u2019m still awake, go ahead.\u201dUffi in her bedroom came into the room if I gave her forgiveness. If you keep in your room, you\u2019ll walk up to me.\u201cMay I put you to bed here today?\u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t stand it\u2026\u201dAnd Yufi\u2019s eyes narrowed. That gaze seems to tangle with me, and it runs on my spine.This is a red flag, I don\u2019t know why, but my body complains it\u2019s dangerous. Yufi\u2019s eyes seemed to be more true than I had ever seen before, and he wanted me in agony.Yuffi approaches me as she is and hugs me to bury her face in my chest.\u201c\u2026 you wanted to be sweet?\u201cYes, not\u2026 I\u2019m really, really sorry\u2026\u201dJust apologizing earlier, Yuffi looks up at me as she buries her face in her chest. My eyes wet enough to cry are turning a feverish glance at me.\u201c\u2026 magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 magic?\u201c\u2026 I want the magic of Lord Anis.\u201dFrom the bottom of my heart I seem sorry, I meditate on my eyes and Yufi squeaks weakly.Well, magic? And it was me tilting my neck, but it immediately occurred to me.\u201cMaybe, the impact of a spiritual covenant?\u201cProbably\u2026\u201dThe Spirit feeds on magic. Then it is not surprising to say that Uffi, who housed the Great Spirit, has also begun to seek magic as food.But that\u2019s where I tilt my neck. Then I wonder if my magic without the Spirit is a food magic for Uffi.\u201cCan\u2019t it be someone else\u2019s magic?\u201c\u2026 why are you saying such a mean thing\u201dPhew, and Yufi, swelling her cheeks and staring at her, seemed younger than her age, no.Until now, I suppressed my emotions and my emotions other than those I needed were an unlikely trick to Yufi, who had cut them off before they got high. It even seems ironic to me if I wonder if this is also the effect of becoming a spiritual contractor. I can\u2019t believe I got rich because I quit people.\u201c\u2026 I thought you said the Spirit had the magic of his choice. Well, for me, it\u2019s Lady Anise.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m a rare man with no spirits, right?\u201cSo, it is. I had it all from the beginning. No talent, no power, no position. I\u2019ve never been hungry. I had nothing to wish for. It was just about fulfilling what I was given. That\u2019s why I wanted you. Lady Anise has everything I need. So the truth is, I want it as much as I want to take it all away, and I\u2019m a little surprised myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m surprised you let me out of your mind.\u201dAre you going to kill me with shame, Yuffi? I don\u2019t see how you can speak such a do-on-the-ball favor.But I think as I stroke Yufi\u2019s hair. I\u2019m sure Yufi hasn\u2019t grown any more minded than she is old. That opened what was lidded by the Spirit covenant.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s like a toddler doesn\u2019t stop looking for it. Though he enjoyed being deceived as an aristocrat, Uffi still seemed to have become more emotionally unstable than he could bear.\u201cMagic is like sipping blood like Raini or something?\u201cNo\u2026 you just have to touch me like this\u201dYufi shrugs in her dreams as she cheeks on her chest like a jerk.The Spirit exists close to man. He watches over us as we take people\u2019s wishes, prayers, and all of that.Maybe that\u2019s why Uffi also wants to lean in and feel the person he seeks. Maybe you want to get my magic food and fill it up. That was embarrassing, but it never seemed like a bad thing.\u201c\u2026 now, I will put up with that\u201d\u201cNow\u2026?\u201c\u2026 you want me to say something ahead?I thought I was laughing innocently. Uffi narrowed his eyes and turned to the sight of that chill.Oh, I finally figured it out. This is a crisis of being \u201ceaten\u201d. In the sense of predation or otherwise.I can put my strength into the arm that was turned to say I wouldn\u2019t let you get away with it. I\u2019m pointing my lips at you somewhere dissatisfied to delude you. I stroke Yuffi\u2019s head.\u201c\u2026 you can laugh at me if you don\u2019t\u201d\u201cYufi is cuter now. I\u2019m sure Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel will be surprised to see Caindkun.\u201dSpeaking of cute, Yufi comes over with her eyes closed and her cheeks rinsed\u2026. My heart jumped by accident. There\u2019s a gap, but it made this kid seem really cute because he was a jerk.\u201c\u2026 only when we\u2019re two, forgive me, right?\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a promise.\u201d\u201cIn front of everyone, I\u2019ll do it right\u201d\u201cYeah. Yufi would be fine\u201d\u201cDear Anis,\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I admire you\u201dI accidentally bit it in my cheek. Will I be able to withstand Yuffi\u2019s onslaught and welcome him safely into the morning? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a happy thing to worry about such crap.It would be a lot harder if we went back to Wang Du. Still, I\u2019m not lost in my mind. If you\u2019ve decided on a way forward, you can go straight ahead. I\u2019m ready for that, because I\u2019ve already decided.\u201c\u2026 oh, the moon is beautiful\u201dOff my gaze, I looked at the moon floating in the sky and I shrugged so small.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: 57\u201cThis country is sick.\u201dI grew up one day being told enough to have an octopus in my ear.This country is sick. As a child, I thought that was a big deal.It\u2019s painful if you get sick. It was a mistake because it was something that everyone knew.The country is sick. That means everyone gets sick. That\u2019s why I thought it was so hard.\u201cNobody\u2019s gonna cure you?I asked him that, but the answer never came back.Bony hands like dead trees stroke his head. Hands like Oki that I don\u2019t feel I can rely on though.\u2018I\u2019ll find out someday. Learn well by then and think carefully\u2019It wasn\u2019t until a few years later that I understood Grandpa\u2019s words.This country is sick. I hope the miracle of the past comes back, to such a disease.Proceed lightly down the hallway to cross noses. No one can blame you. But the gaze that can be directed is the gaze itself that can be directed at the rest of us. Not at all. The same gaze as today, \u201che\u201d walks down the hall laughing inside, with his nose.A cave of wisdom that houses a number of materials and papers for the country\u2019s proud research institute. The knee of the Ministry of Magic, which also boasts authority as your opinion number for governance. Those gathered here are the nationally recognized elites.It may therefore be the natural make-up that has an exclusive side. I guess the unfriendly gaze at the rest of us \u201che\u201d has such a physique.The development of the Kingdom of Palletia is greatly influenced by the magical faith, with the Spirit as its friend. Extensive spiritual resources for the production of competent wizards. Let us also say that that is the backbone that underpins the national power of the Kingdom of Palletia.I remember someone saying that the Ministry of Magic is such a glorious place to symbolize the glory of the Kingdom of Palettia. That\u2019s a fact, I guess it\u2019s right. If we rise to this status, we can give our opinions on politics. It is promised that he will be chosen for the narrow gate.(Well, whether that\u2019s right or not)\u201cHe\u201d laughs inside, with his nose. Indeed, the Kingdom of Palletia is a country that has developed around magic. But that is not the case when it comes to whether everything in the country is supported only by magical benefits.It is the role of royalty and nobility to lead the country. But it is the people who are building the foundations of the country. The people cultivate the land, recover the resources, and spread them both inside and outside the country.Not in the country without the people. The people are many who cannot use magic. I can\u2019t handle magic without being the bastard son of an aristocrat.It is therefore true that there are aristocrats who look down on the civilian population. That number is by no means small. Still, I suppose the relationship between civilians and nobles has persisted to this day, painstakingly, because the magic benefits are still enormous.Power is power. And magic can be a power that leads to power. That is why nobility seeks to be a competent wizard. To myself, and to my child. And to descendants who inherit their own blood.Protect the people because nobility has power, and the people devote themselves to nobility because they are protected. At the end of the day, it can\u2019t be done without one or the other.Still, nobility is above us. Few people work tyranny because they protect them. That is creating a deep gulf between the twitch and the people and nobility.(This country is sick)That\u2019s what \u201che\u201d \u2018s grandfather said. Tell them to learn well and think hard until the day they know what that word means. And he thinks this country is sick right now.The beginning was more than a decade ago. Around that time, the Kingdom of Palletia was falling into a sloping sun. That was due to the rebellion planned by the nobles who accumulated resentment against the king at the time.At the time, it was the father of His Majesty Orphans, now king, who was on the throne. It was a policy of preference for the adventurers and the civilian population that was well remembered by its predecessor.The nobility has the absolute power of magic, but it was also dangerous to go to the front line because of its position. Even if the immense power of magic, for example, could be wielded on the battlefield, he was pregnant with the risk that if he lost his life on that battlefield, there would be no one to rule the territory.With the war against other countries at stake, it is the policy of preferential treatment of civilians that was carried out by the Predecessor in order to protect the status and personality of the nobility.Naturally there exists in the long lasting Kingdom of Palletia the luxury and decline of the noble house with its length of history. And it was not uncommon for people in declining houses to interact with civilians. More and more civilians with potentially magical talents have been gaining ground since this time.It would have been nice if this would have made me a knight serving adventurers and nations. But those who used their talents to work evil appeared.A wizard without nobility. Taking advantage of that notoriety and the spread of damage, the Predecessor decided to launch a policy to pick up potentially magical talented civilians.That was the support for the adventurers and the new system of holding them as nobles because of their civilian status. Support for adventurers who can reach out to those who cannot be saved, which cannot be reached solely by aristocratic authority. And he tried to take a remarkably active civilian as a nobleman and re-take potential wilderness talents into the country.This will result in heavy rebellion from conservative nobles who value blood and a long tradition.It was distracted from the honor of protecting the country, and once and for all, my dissatisfaction with the Predecessor, who favoured the civilian population, grew. The policy put in place to protect his body led to rebellion from those he should have followed, and his mind and body were weakened.Where radical nobility gained momentum to the verge of beeping in line with the weakness of the Predecessor, those who settled this situation appeared.That was the king-partisan faction led by the current king, Orphans.At the time, as a depressed royalty, Orphans, who was a stranger to working in the dirt, showed sudden martial arts. It is said that few nobles were not surprised by this activity.Orphans\u2019 real brother, who had the right to inherit the first throne, which had become the flag of the anti-Predecessor faction, would be taken over in the midst of the battle to suppress this uprising. It was the moment when the death of his brother decided that Orphanth, who had the right to inherit the throne by rolling up, would become the next king.It was the Marquis de Silphine Mays who welcomed such an Orphance as queen. She was the daughter of a leading nobleman who participated in a faction of anti-Predecessors, yet a war maiden who destroyed her own house.For the atonement of his own house, which was a queen but sinned against his predecessor, he did everything in his power to embark himself on diplomacy and retreat from external illness.Grants Magenta, the next owner of the Duke of Magenta family, who had long served the royal family beside the king, tried to stabilise his internal affairs by refraining.Once the king\u2019s authority was to be restored by Orphans. And the policy imposed by Orphans also dissatisfied the nobility a little bit, and the country quietly slowly regained stability.Yes. I did get the peace back. But the country was quietly starting to get sick by the policies Orphans had exchanged at that time.(The reason is the preferential policy to the Ministry of Magic)The Ministry of Magic was in a neutral position at the time. But in an effort to contain the steadily increasing number of anti-Predecessors, Orphans hoped to cooperate with the Ministry of Magic.The anti-Predecessors were mainly conservatives who valued the traditions of the past, but also militants who were brave and famous. The family line, proud of its magical authority and proud to show martial arts, gathered around it. As a force against such militant factions, Orphans called for help from the Ministry of Magic.The Ministry of Magic is a research institute pursuing magic studies and the truth to get closer to the Spirit and God. However, as a result, a number of competent wizards were also enrolled. But I don\u2019t ask for the honor of martial arts enough to point a sword at the king. What they wanted was power and money for their own exploration.So Orphans launched a preferential policy, admitting his later educational initiative at the College of Aristocrats, and allowing him to participate in order to seek his views on the political arena. Thus the Ministry of Magic steadily gained power.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cHe\u201d laughs at what a barren extreme it was that gradually made the country ill.Orphans will certainly be a good king who has passed through the turmoil and calmed the country.But it left a great source of anxiety in the future as a price for that calm. Whether he was a good king or called a foolish king who later created the cause of bankrupting the country will be told by later historians.(His Majesty Orphans leveraged the help of the Ministry of Magic to stabilize the country. In the meantime, I also raised factions that would be my own hands and feet, but the spread of the authority of the Ministry of Magic was faster than I thought. It was the wind that competed for hegemony by Wu that diminished, but it seems to be a good battle with the anti-Predecessors when it comes to the degree of voter thought. I hear it\u2019s worse this way if it\u2019s a bad tach. It was also painful for the previous king to have fallen)If my lord survived.Having debilitated himself physically and mentally, the Predecessor is leaving the world before he sees the reign of Orphans.Orphans\u2019 mother has also left the world when she was weak and Orphans was young. Other brothers, who could be called flesh parents, would argue with their own hands, and Orphans had no faction of his own.Even if I had it, its size was small. Although its quality was superior, it still does not affect a wide range. That led me to forgive the rise of the Ministry of Magic.(And I tried my best to raise the next king, but he said it was behind my back)Was the factor behind it still Anisphere Wynn Palettia?A strange princess who set up a theory that revolts head-on with the idea of the Ministry of Magic. That presence must have been a threat to the Ministry of Magic.If you become an abominable child who can\u2019t use magic, your hatred will deepen. For the Ministry of Magic, it would have been frustrating to be the blood muscle of the Royal Family.Of course, not all haters of Anisphere. Some of them felt in Anisphere\u2019s founded theory. But Anisphere was not actively associated with them, and he drew himself into a cage.It was his brother, Algard, who was incited to do so. Ever since he was mistaken for Anisphere, the Ministry of Magic laid eyes on Algard in an attempt to take in even the kingdom, eroding its spirit.They move under their beliefs. \u201cHe\u201d doesn\u2019t deny it. But that\u2019s where the people are missing. In the end, it doesn\u2019t accumulate because it goes around and everything is behind it.\u201cThe people just need to be there, that\u2019s the idea. That\u2019s stalled. Sooner or later, it will starve and erode the country. No, I\u2019m talking about being pretty eroded already.\u201dThe first king to build the kingdom of Palletia says he made a spiritual covenant with the Spirit to gain immense power.And the people sheltered by the king lifted up the kingdom and laid the foundations: the Kingdom of Palletia.Is this a retrograde of the times? Concentrate the authority by magic and follow the people. I guess that\u2019s certainly a glorious reenactment that once was.This country is sick.I\u2019m worried about a disease called glory of the past.Things are different from the past. There are not many civilians, and there is a build-up of dissatisfaction with the nobility who created the ditch.Although the Spirit faith is a faith rooted in this country, its sense of distance varies between nobility and civilians.When the gulf was launched as a policy for the nobility to rise again. Can\u2019t we just say that civilians don\u2019t take weapons this time?When that happens, it\u2019s Anisphere Win Palettia you should be afraid of.Even the civilian population will be able to bring out phenomena similar to magic at the price of magic alone. \u201cHe\u201d felt so, fearing that many in the Ministry of Magic.(I wonder if this will happen once you have the authority. I also used to hear that the Ministry of Magic is in a more research-oriented, closed shape\u2026)Dissatisfaction with the Anisphere, which is secretly spreading. But let\u2019s just say Orphans hit his hand well there.The royal fate of elucidating the spiritual covenant from the perspective of magic would have shocked the Ministry of Magic. When this works, Anisphere will be able to handle magic and may cease to be an abominable child.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to get rid of the idea that once took root, but if we were able to give magic benefits, we wouldn\u2019t have to do it until we repelled. Such air is being created.\u201cWell, I wonder how it rolls. Let me show you something, huh? Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cHe\u201d laughs at the ashes.The princess floated behind her brain the other day, traveling from Wang Du in search of the clue.What changes are being made by Anisphere, or Uphilia beside her, when she returns?Miguel Graphite proceeded down the hallway of the Ministry of Magic with a grin on his mouth, as he said it was a joy without accumulating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: 58\u201c\u2026 Damn, where did those two go?I don\u2019t like the footsteps going through the royal castle. The castle where the king lives is an immense size if you walk alone. As a result, the whining voice sounds well, as does the moving footsteps.The structure of the castle is thought to be intrusive, so it is necessary to make roundabouts, or if you don\u2019t know the structure, you can get lost.A samurai walking zero bumps and complaints, Ilia was looking for two figures who were such royal castles.\u201cPrincess! Prince! Where are you!?\u201dYes, those are two princesses and princes of this country. It is two people: Anisphere Wynn Palettia and Algardo Bona Palettia.Ilia Coral is the exclusive samurai of Anisphere and is in a position to have to take care of her. These days, that troubled child who brings his brother Algard around to make noise about the royal castle has been cloud-held.\u201cNot at all\u2026\u2026! It gives me more work\u2026\u2026!Ilia is blurry in a harsh way. My feet tread naturally on the floor fast, and my footsteps are even wrapped up in intimidation.Earlier, there was a little noise in the maid\u2019s pantry. That was the story of Anisphere and Algard running away with the sheets they had folded in the laundry.Why did you run away? Why did you do that in the first place? When I didn\u2019t keep an eye on her because she was a dedicated samurai, I even asked her boss, the chief samurai, to say a few words, and Ilia was a little grumpy.Ilia doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s that emotional. Still, lately, there has been more frustration with Anisphere.If Anisphere does something, there will be reprimand for herself as a dedicated maid. Totally unreasonable. I sigh when I think this is also part of the misfortune of being blinded by that ruinous princess.Anyway, we have to find those two now. I can\u2019t stop sighing about where the hell I\u2019ve been.\u201cAh, sister, I knew I\u2019d stop\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Al?! It\u2019s okay!\u201d\u201cSo, but\u2026\u201dWhen the voice was heard, Ilia caught her eyes and switched paths. There\u2019s a staircase ahead of us. On top of that was all the evil kids I was looking for.It was time to find Algardo looking around anxiously, and Anisphere dressed in a rare outfit with sheets tied to his body for some reason, trying to raise his anger.\u201cLook, I\u2019m coming. \u2013 Whoa!\u201cWhat?\u201dAnisphere pulled the sheets together and took a good jump from the top of the stairs. Ilia, who showed herself under the stairs, turns her eyes round to a sudden oddity and stops moving for a moment.The stairs here are huge, and if the kid wants to snap his leg on the way, it\u2019s considered a major injury. I don\u2019t know what the hell made you jump out like that, but Ilia runs to take the anisphere in a hurry.Then we see a change in the movement of the anisphere as Ilia sees it. Anisphere jumped out of the stairs with good momentum, and the sheets spread with that momentum. The sheets bracketed on the extremities spread as if they were sails of a sailboat, slowing down the body of the anisphere.\u201cWind, blow. Whoa!Then the wind blew momentously from the back of the anisphere. Ilia remembers the phenomenon very well. That stupid princess, you forgot to use the Spirit Stone of the Wind to plunge into the wall!?. This was a reproduction then.Ilia kicks and jumps aggressively as she falls and is slapped to the ground. Then, Anisphere\u2019s body lifts\u2026\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cBohu.\u201dIlia\u2019s face was buried in Anisphere\u2019s belly. Illia, out of balance in the air, grabbed the anisphere aggressively, and did not assume a weight for two, or the body of the anisphere, which was gaining temporary buoyancy, is drawn to gravity.Algard, who was watching the whole thing, turned his face bright blue and covered his eyes. And the sound of Algard falling on the painful floor echoed as he covered his eyes.\u201c- Ahhh\u2026!?\u2026!?!?!!!!\u201d\u201cI was there, say, Ilia!? It\u2019s okay!? I hit my head!?\u201dIlia was underlayed and there was no damage to the anisphere. However, it is not a hoarding in the underlying Ilia. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m still a child, but I added that weight and fell off without even being able to take it.My back and head hurts so much that tears seep in. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want to go around on the spot, but it\u2019s difficult to twist my body because the anisphere is on top. And the pain accelerates even more because of the itching and shaking anisphere.\u201c\u2026 ugh, this\u2026!Oh, no. That\u2019s what I thought. Anisphere got round with her head in her arms. Ilia pulls off the anisphere with momentum and lowers it to the floor. Is it because of anger, Ilia\u2019s gripped fists tremble small.And the sound of the fist bones sounded so loud that Algardo, who had covered his eyes and hidden them, shook up.\u201cThis\u2026 fool!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Huh! But listen, Father! I think it was a good idea! I think we can ski that one! It\u2019s Musavianis!\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about! What are you doing with Algard?Orphanth catches an eyebrow and punches his fist bone in the head of the anisphere with his anger. Ghapi, screaming and Anisphere tears eyes with her head.Anisphere said stealing the sheets was an experiment to fly the example sky. You think he lifted the sheets with the wind that woke him up with the Spirit Stone of the Wind and tried to glide himself away with that force?Not at all, where does such an idea come from? Terror is the temperament of the Anisphere, which is said to be odd.\u201cAlgardo is Algardo too! What are you gonna do without stopping Anisphere, too!?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 oh, sorry\u2026\u201dThough he was not fisted, Algardo was also subjected to a stronger reprimand than Orphans. Algardo, still two years younger than Anisphere, is young, shrinking smaller and trembling.Ilia sighs small as she still shields her stifling and sore back. Every time you make this noise, your body has to keep it.\u201cChi, Father\u2026! Al, I took him out! If you scold me, leave me alone! And I want you to see my Mussabi! That would work!\u201cRejected, fool! That\u2019s enough! Stay back in your room!\u201cYeahhh! I thought this time it would work! Father\u2019s ass! Old face! Full of young gray hair!\u201cWhat the hell, you horse girl!! Whose fault is the young gray hair?!?\u201d\u201cGahhhhhhh!?\u201dOrphans pushes his clenching fist from both sides to the temples of the anisphere, twisting it well. Compressed to be pinched with force at the temples, the anisphere screams around the algae scratching to escape.After a short period of oppression of the temples by Orphans, Anisphere falls to the floor like she did her best, trembling tingly. It was odd for Ilia that Algardo was poking the anisphere with his fingers in such a way as to be afraid.\u201cNo alarm or gap at all!\u2026 Illia, are you all right?\u201cYes, no problem\u201d\u201cWhat, thanks for the help. He can do a lot in the castle\u2026\u201dExhaling sighs like tired, Orphans held his forehead.Anisphere is causing disturbances every day. That\u2019s due to her inability to use magic.Magic that can be handled if you are royal or noble. Anisphere was told that she could not handle it in any way. And then she\u2019s dealing with spiritual stones and causing all sorts of disturbances.\u201cI thought I punished you for the hot water incident before\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 that was a headache case too\u201dThe other day, Anisphere held the Spirit Stone of Fire to produce hot water, where she jumped in and sustained general burns.He said he wanted to take a bath and Orphans was about to hold his head blindly.\u201c\u2026 no, but it was good that I was able to decide to renovate the bathroom.\u201dNothing. The bath doesn\u2019t have to go through a spiritual stone to care. And Ilaria knows that Orphans secretly likes the habit of soaking in hot tubs.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Although it is an anisphere that causes all the problems, many admit that what emerges from that bizarre idea is useful. Therefore, there are places where Orphans also remain silent\u2026\u201cYou can\u2019t let a boulder take the initiative to imitate you like you\u2019re injured. Let me be discreet for a while.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026. I think I\u2019m constantly struggling, but I\u2019m going to ask for Anis. Ilia.\u201dPounded on the shoulder, Ilia bows her head deeply, even though she is afraid.And hold aside the annisphere, who is squatting with his head in his arms as he roars, and rear the office of Orphans.Algardo also exits the room and comes after him with a small run to follow after Ilaria.\u201cSister, are you okay?\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s no hedgehog, it\u2019s just a spring\u201d\u201cShikaspring?\u201cYour sister is dead\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s alive\u2026?\u201cBokeh hasn\u2019t made it through, Ilia!\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dDisgusting, Ilia frowns all the time. I think he\u2019s a really noisy, annoying, handy kid.Anisphere who repeats a rare statement while being held by Ilia and Algardo who keeps leaning his neck against such an anisphere. Ilia advances with the anisphere in her arms while pissing off her shoulders.There are so many different emotions staring at those three unusual people. Something to flatter your shoulders about. Something to laugh bitterly at, something to look hard at. What people point at is different.\u201c\u2026 father, alle\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 keep your eyes open so you don\u2019t point your finger, Uffi\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dThe gaze I felt from around me was very uncomfortable, and Ilia could only walk faster to escape.\u2026 Ilia had such a nostalgic dream.Depression, Ilia, who was rowing the boat with us, awoke from a slight sleep. He seemed to have become insensitive as to whether he was getting tired, sleeping in a chair, etc.\u201c\u2026 no, you just have more time than tired, this is\u201dRight now, there\u2019s no one in the outhouse except Ilia. It would also be very quiet here if the Lord, Anisphere and Uphilia, and Raini, as a samurai, also accompanied them.Even after cleaning and laundry in my daily routine, I don\u2019t take care of them without my residents, and Ilaria doesn\u2019t have the hobby of killing time by herself.\u201c\u2026 I hope nothing happens\u201dRecently, Anisphere began to show calm. It also comes with Uphilia and Raini. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201cLet\u2019s get ready for when we get back.\u201dWhat achievements will come of the anisphere that went to meet the Spirit Contractor? I think it would be nice if that effort paid off because I seemed to be feeling particularly stuck lately.Think that far, Ilia looks back at her thoughts once more\u2026. since when, you\u2019ve bonded so far yourself, too.\u201c\u2026 you don\u2019t feel bad\u201dIlia was only treated as a pawn by her parents. It is a pawn only to gain access to a powerful nobleman and to bond with him. There is no such thing as love.No, it could have been loved in the sense of tools. Though it could have all gone to waste, too. I don\u2019t even bother to check.Ilaria thinks it\u2019s worth it to be here. Lately, not only Anisphere, but also a cute junior named Raini.\u201c\u2026 Raini, I hope you\u2019re not hungry\u201dI was giving you some blood, and I was wondering if that junior who can\u2019t keep an eye on me is okay. Even Anisphere and Uphilia\u2019s blood won\u2019t be easy to drink because of fear.Then I\u2019ll give you a full dose of blood when you get back. Ilia gets up from her chair and stretches her spine if she doesn\u2019t stay fit for it.If you give Raini too much blood and he\u2019s anaemic, Raini will be sick too, he said. That\u2019s not what I meant. Ilaria will not fail to make an effort to make sure that she is perfectly comfortable if she does.Turn your shoulders to return the stretched spine. As a result, Ilaria, who had finished solving her body, headed to the kitchen to make snacks that she would eat.\u201c\u2026 Since when do you think one meal is tasteless?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, are you awake?\u201c\u2026 oh, this is already such a time. Looks like he was napping.\u201d\u201cWas that so?\u2026 Have you had a good dream?\u201c\u2026 Well, yeah. It\u2019s just a dream I miss. Really, I miss you so much. That\u2019s the dream.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: 59My breath hurts.My vision is distorted and my lungs are going to be torn now.I\u2019ve stopped feeling the feel of my waving hands and the feeling of my feet treading on the ground.I\u2019m just running. He runs without even knowing how he\u2019s running.Still have to run. Feet, hands in front. Like pushing your body out.You have to run. Otherwise \u2013 he\u2019s coming.\u201cGood day, Master Navre! We\u2019ve outrun them, so we\u2019re adding one more week!\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!?\u201dAnd he fell.Why did this happen?That would have to tell Navre Sprout what happened to him.Navre Sprout. Born to the Earl of Sprout family, he has Matthew Sprout, the father who heads the Knights of the High Kingsguard.Character is full of justice and thick in brother-in-law. He is also a young man with a soft waist and has advanced as far as possible with the ideal knight.But such a bright future of his involved in a major case of rocking the country made him twist and bend.It was an engagement breaking disturbance between Prince Algardo Bona Palettia, the next heir to the throne, and his fianc\u00e9e, the Duke of Ufilia Magenta.The beginning of this was the relationship between the two chilled out and the presence of Baroness Raini Sian, who threw ripples into such a relationship between the two.Raini, who was so concerned about Algardo because of his special origins, told the story that Ufiria, jealous of Raini like that, had set up shady figs and plots on Raini.Everyone testified with their mouths together, and the noble sons around Algard bound to impeach Uphilia\u2019s sins. And I guess that fate has been greatly insane since the day the impeachment by Algard took place.It was the \u201cPrincess Kiteretz\u201d, Anisphere Wynn Palettia, the one who would not have known in this country, who drove the fate mad.Her Majesty the King, who took Uphilia away from the place of impeachment and was overheard of this incident, put a decree on this occasion.Navre is recognised in this matter as one of the central factions that impeached Uphilia with Algard. That\u2019s the same perception in person.I thought that was for Raini, who was attracted to me.But the various events that happened thereby cast a shadow on Navre\u2019s heart.The fact that Anisphere\u2019s allegations made him aware of his divergence, and that Algard planned to annihilate Anisphere, depriving him of his inheritance rights. There\u2019s a Chartreuse conspiracy involved.Navre\u2019s shock was not half-baked, and his heart was broken by his too much stupidity.Every day, there\u2019s no reason to do anything. I can\u2019t feel like going back to college or act to atone for my mistakes. Days just pass by for no reason.Wouldn\u2019t it be better to go straight back to the realm? I even hear a whisper like that. I was wondering if that was okay too, and Navre just waited for my father\u2019s decision.\u2013 That\u2019s when the \u201cguy\u201d showed up.Gark Lamp. He was the son of a knight belonging to the Knights of the Borders, and for some reason he was a one-of-a-kind opponent who wanted to join the Knights of Kingsguard, not the Borders.I\u2019ve seen him face to face, but I didn\u2019t exchange words. He came to visit because he was worried about Navre.Honestly, I just found it annoying for Navre. The response would have been thorny, too. I wish you would have punished me for that and gone home\u2026\u201cMaster Navre! Your body! Let\u2019s work out!Why did that happen?No matter how much I remember, I have no basis to be convinced.If you say they pushed you off, yes, but I don\u2019t know how they pushed you off.Gark doesn\u2019t stand a valve. I think you\u2019re more of a lousy talker. It seems silly to suspect that words and deeds are straightforward either way.I\u2019m just really worried, I believe it\u2019s the right thing to do, and for some reason, I\u2019m on it.Navre was afraid. But no matter how much he tries to escape, he shows up from nowhere. When he saw Gark\u2019s face in his dreams, Navre doubted his sanity that he might have gone mad.And Navre stopped thinking, to this day.Every time I can put on a perimeter delay with Gurk, I get more running course periodicity. So I have to score a goal before Gark can catch up to me.Navre, who did the perimeter of the run before finally being pulled out by Gark, was breathing on his shoulders as he calmed down his heart, which was about to explode. I was going to throw up if I caught my guard.\u201cGood luck! Dear Navre!\u201d\u201c\u2026 you, why, so\u2026 well, what\u2026\u201dThough sweating is what it is, Gark still looked like he could afford it. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s open. The eyes, and the full smile that floats, look adorable.Navre looked up into the sky, desperately calming his breath. I feel comfortable with the breeze if I stop my leg. Unexpectedly narrow your eyes to the feel of the wind.\u201cIf you take a break, it\u2019s a mock fight!\u201c\u2026 Soudana\u201dNavre nods as he loses his temper to protest the earliest.Build strength, do matchmaking auditions, and eat well, sleep well. That\u2019s all.That\u2019s just it, but the contents are equal to hell. The special training conducted by the Guark standard shattered the spirit of Navre.When I asked the knights, my father\u2019s men, if this was a common amount of exercise as knights, they all looked away and shook their necks left and right. And as he slapped his shoulders with pity one after another, Navre seemed frustrated.In retrospect of such memories, Navre\u2019s body, flirtatious and rising, is headed for nature and the next archaeology.When he realized it, Navre was afraid. He said his body was getting used to it first. Still, now, and in a flash, he cuts it off, sets up a simulated sword and faces Gark.\u201cShall we then begin, Master Navre!\u201c\u2026 ah\u201dAnd the simulation that began was surprisingly quiet.It may be said that the operation is slow. Gark moves at a speed he can follow with his eyes. And whether that sword muscle is also empowering.Follow it firmly with your eyes and \u201ctake\u201d it together. That way Gark draws the sword and draws the sword muscle from another angle.Kan, Kon, and. The sooner you lose your mind, the quieter it sounds. Still, Navre\u2019s face is serious in itself. Soon there will be no fatigue or discontent on his face, and Navre will follow Gark\u2019s sword muscle.\u201cWhoa, you\u2019re a little early. Shall we pace it up?\u201c\u2026 do as you please. That\u2019s the way to go with it, isn\u2019t it?\u201cWell, keep going, please\u201dIf Navre frowned and told him, Gark laughs slightly lifting the edge of his mouth.Exhale slowly. The next sword flash that Navre swung through clearly increases speed and approaches the guard.Dangerously Gark matches Navre\u2019s sword and plays the sword. As such, the cutting knot that begins increases the speed of the previous step.One in, one in, one in again. The sound is intense and the movement is light. The attacker is Navre and the recipient is Gark. From the side, you can clearly see the difference between the two.\u201cOh, whoa!!\u201dNavre waves a simulated sword in a desperate shape. Keep beating the sword that keeps getting bounced to the girk so it doesn\u2019t kill momentum.By contrast, Gark doesn\u2019t make it slight. To be precise, a stepped foot never leaves the ground. It\u2019s a light wrist snap or minimal movement that leads to a blow from Navre\u2019s entire body.It\u2019s like a big wall, but if you punch it, it\u2019s going to lose strength. The use of force, and the height of local power to receive maximum force with minimal force. No matter how many times he felt it, Navre had his tongue wrapped around him.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.(I had some confidence in the handling of the sword\u2026 now you\u2019re shattered)Gark\u2019s sword muscle is straight. But not boneless. supple, and yet powerful.That strength is not a force to lay low. \u201cSlash,\u201d \u201cPlay,\u201d \u201cFlush.\u201d Efficiently twist out this basic behavior with minimal and maximum force.Whatever the posture, whatever the circumstances, it was Gurk\u2019s sword that drew his power out in vain. That made Navre feel\u2026 beautiful with jealousy.I guess he also has talent in person. But there\u2019s a training in his sword that just buries that impression. I just worked out foolishly and kept working out. Years are no different than they are. I honestly wonder if I\u2019ve been able to work this far. That\u2019s why I get jealous.\u2013 How did you manage to train like that?To Navre, who asked so, Gark answered with a shy scratch of his head somewhere.\u201cI lost to Anisphere once before. Because I\u2019m not that good at magic, and I\u2019m not even smart. So all I could be proud of was the fact that the princess didn\u2019t want me to stick her neck in the play, and she fought and sold it, and it was scattered.\u201dIt\u2019s really still the biggest stain of all, and Gark is still proud of it for some reason.\u2018Then there really came the demon, which was originally an exercise, and the Anisphere who accompanied him is naturally very active. I freaked out and trembled and couldn\u2019t even do a lot of work\u2026 but I\u2019m flattered that I fought well without distracting myself. There\u2019s a chance.\u2019Trying to empty his hands to miss the old days, Gark went on like this.He said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s sweet. I\u2019m not smart, I\u2019m not good at magic. All I have is this body and praised eyes. So let\u2019s not lose sight and work out what we can do first. That\u2019s what I thought. Princess Anisphere can\u2019t use magic normally, so she can\u2019t lose!\u201dThat led me to build my body. Improved basic health and incorporation of observations into daily training.How does the opponent move and what is the best move to deal with then? Look, remember, imitate, repeat. If you feel uncomfortable, pinch it down and fix it. If there is any waste, I will scrape it off. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been foolishly repeating.That\u2019s why Gark\u2019s style was created. Honestly, Navre can\u2019t beat Gark without magic. You can\u2019t win a head-on battle with magic or in between guards. And Gark tries to pull in the situation to win.That attitude was reflected in the way it was, irresistibly jealous to Navre.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m weak\u201d\u2018If you want to be strong, anyone is vulnerable at that point! You\u2019re right to think you\u2019re weak! Otherwise, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be strong, no, I think some guys just want to be strong! Well, that must be where it starts anyway.\u2019\u201cBeginning?\u201d\u2018If you want to be strong, you just have to be! That\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about!If you wanted to be, you should be. Navre was taken aback by the lightly said words, and felt like what was staring in his heart was taken away.And that\u2019s why it burned up. Pushing a pulse is a disgrace, rolling like this, embarrassing myself for losing and just envying someone.Be strong.If I thought so again, my trembling legs held my strength.No matter how many times you fall and you\u2019re about to throw up, the limit comes and you want to stop it already, so that this thought will still remain even beyond.How did this happen? \u2013 That\u2019s because I was weak.Does it continue to be so hard? \u2013 To keep saying that.The only way to cross the shameful self is to become our samurai and move on.Push it to the point where you can\u2019t even think about it, and move on with that pain.My sword never reaches the Gark. Gerk\u2019s disfigurement will not come true.But someday. One day, those thoughts will burn in my heart.\u201cYes, there\u2019s a gap\u201d\u201cGu -!\u201dKan, and Navre gets hit in the wrist and drops a mock sword. With a simulated sword on Navre\u2019s neck, Gark grins happily.Seeing a smile that seemed hateful, Navre shrugged and momentously fell on the spot in bold letters.\u201c\u2026 regret it\u201d\u201cYep. Well, let\u2019s do it again.\u201d\u201cOne day, I\u2019ll repeat this battle.\u201d\u201cWith magic, it\u2019s hard for me to win\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you don\u2019t make sense!\u201cWell, we need to get more strength.\u201dI can still afford it.Yes, he showed his teeth and laughed. Navre sent his gaze to stare, but he didn\u2019t feel bad.I don\u2019t know if this path is one that snows its own shame. However, if you can\u2019t even see the sign, maybe you can run to our samurai. Even if that\u2019s a long way off. Now, forward, forward.\u201c\u2026 I want to be strong\u201dAnd the next day, Navre would run a lot because of the difference in circumference between the guards, and he would still lick the ground.His path of recurrence is still far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60: 60We all know her. Fewer people will not know because Anisphere Win Palettia is the princess of this country.Many people know that she likes magic. Even though I like magic, I didn\u2019t benefit from magic. Someone who was struck by such a tragedy.Few sympathize with Anisphere though. Because all the time she develops tools that are bright and energetically strange, fly around the sky with those tools, and achieve something magical even though she can\u2019t use magic.Everyone knows. Anisphere Wynn Palettia is a strange princess.\u201cLong time no see, neither has Wang Du\u201dLlumiel squeaks zero as he looks at the castle town through the window of the carriage. Having successfully met her, the spiritual contractor, and brought her home, we were finally able to return to Castle Town.Llumiel was in the carriage with me and Yufi, Raini. She\u2019s the most important person for a country no less than a princess, so I\u2019m convinced of that treatment.Only Raini was told who Llumiel was. Raini doesn\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m inside anymore. He looked like he was surprised by the boulder when he found out that Llumiel was my distant ancestor.Lumiel, on the other hand, seemed surprised by Raini as well. That\u2019s because Llumiel realized at first sight that Raini was a vampire.Lyumiel knew about the vampire, but it doesn\u2019t seem there\u2019s a deep connection just because we\u2019ve met by chance and exchanged words.Still, according to Llumiel\u2019s testimony, the vampires are confused by people, hiding their identity from them and lurking themselves. He says it\u2019s an intuition that Llumiel has lived as a spirit for years to be able to discern vampires.It is not something I would expect from Uffi as an anti-vampire because it is said that Uffi will be able to do so in the future. If you can apply it and make use of it in magic props, it will be your word.While I had that conversation, I came back to King\u2019s Capital. It has already been told by our fathers that Llumiel will follow us. I feel a little sorry for your father that you\u2019re bothering me again.\u201cWhen is Lumiel going to come to the king\u2019s capital?\u201cHmm? You\u2019ve only been here to show your face before and after Orphans took power. Yeah, but you\u2019re not showing up. I saw you go home.\u201d\u201cFreedom, you too\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what the contract is. He said he wouldn\u2019t restrict my freedom instead of leaving the country. Though it was Orphans who gave a clear testimony. Until then, it was like a promise.\u201dI\u2019m a little curious as to what kind of encounter Llumiel had with his father and mother and how the connection settled him into his current relationship.I was interested, but the carriage journey ends with my arrival at the Royal Castle. I\u2019ll talk to you another time, and I\u2019ll get off at the escort of the Sprout Knights who opened the door for me.The carriage stopped, and at the entrance to the castle where we got off, Father and Mother, then Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel were waiting.Me, Uphilia, down in Raini\u2019s order, and at the end of the day Lumiel gets off. Llumiel loosened his eyes when he saw his fathers.\u201cOh, they\u2019re all getting old. Long time no see.\u201d\u201cLord Lumi. Nice to see you again.\u201dIt was my mother who came forward first. Seeing her mother like that, Llumiel grabbed her by her mother in a agile move. I can\u2019t react to the aggressive movement either, and my mother fits in Llumiel\u2019s arm.\u201cYou\u2019re tiny anyway! Silfi is! How have you been?\u201cHere, here! Lumi, get off me! It\u2019s in front of His Majesty!\u201cIt\u2019s not good, I haven\u2019t seen your face in a long time. Um, we\u2019re all old, but you\u2019re still young!\u201cLet go\u2026!Oh, that mother resists with all her might, but she doesn\u2019t look comfortable at all\u2026! Surprisingly, Llumiel, you\u2019re strong\u2026Unexpectedly watching the heartwarming interaction between my mother and Llumiel, my father walked over with a bitter smile.\u201cLord Rhumi, will you let Silphine go and do it? We\u2019re not kids anymore.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re like a cute chick to me forever, aren\u2019t you?\u2026 but you\u2019ve grown. I misjudged you. But did he do it?\u201cIf that\u2019s what it looks like, then I can still be proud that I\u2019ve got something called the King\u2019s Piercing Lock.\u201dCalmly Father is exchanging words with Llumiel. Though Llumiel\u2019s eyes, staring at his father for a little while, floated a similar color to his worries, it was an instant.My mother manages to get out of Llumiel\u2019s arms and Lord Grants walks in instead of quickly getting the distance.\u201cI\u2019m out of time, Lord Rhumi\u201d\u201cOh, Grants\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. you look good. Isn\u2019t that a little better for you?\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201cMy daughter-in-law seems fine and above all\u2026. you\u2019ve given me an interesting daughter.\u201d\u201cIt is most praiseworthy of you to say that to Master Lumi.\u201dAt some point Mrs Nerschel is also advancing and exchanging words. When I look at it like this, I\u2019m impressed that I really had a connection with my fathers.It was ruthless to pinch our mouths in the air that warmed up our old relationship, but the Knights of Sprout cut us out because we had stories to build up and move the place.But again, I think it\u2019s a pretty good number of people.We take our seats in each room that is used as one of the conference rooms.It was still from your father who cut out the story.\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re back well. Annis, it\u2019s Uphilia. I\u2019ve been looking forward to your return.\u201d\u201cYes, I just wrote to you earlier to give you an overview\u2026\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026. I was also surprised that Lord Lumi would be visiting, but is it in writing about the backdrop of the spiritual covenant?\u201cYes\u2026. a spiritual covenant was impossible for me. Instead, Uffi was able to exchange spiritual contracts.\u201dMy father laid his eyes down on my answer. He seemed to digest his thoughts so he could bite them off.That\u2019s not just my father. Both my mother and Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel had similar faces.For the time being, vacate between silences before Father exhales loudly before continuing the conversation.\u201c\u2026 well. If so, have you been able to elucidate about the Spirit Contract? So did Uffi, who became a contractor, but above all, it was the clarification of the Spirit Contract that gave you the proposition.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of things we need to talk about\u2026. soundproofing here is sufficient?\u201cWhatever. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dFather nods forcefully. Well, it was a room I\u2019ve never been in, but is this a room for such an important meeting? Because I don\u2019t really get into these places in the Royal Palace, either.\u201cFirst of all, do you say that you have almost figured it out when it comes to spiritual covenants\u2026 are you more competent than I explain\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s why Lord Lumi went out of his way to King\u2019s Capital?I look at Llumiel like my mother was slightly confused. Llumiel is enjoying the tea Raini has put in.Collecting his gaze, Llumiel takes his mouth off the tea and looks over at everyone as he breaks down his posture and pokes a cheek wand at his desk.\u201cThese kids had a chance. I thought you could give me the knowledge I know.\u201dTo Llumiel\u2019s reply, Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s reactions were coloured with surprise and perplexity.Speaking of which, you haven\u2019t revealed yourself to your fathers either. But this is how we get in, so you might not be surprised.Your father and mother looked restless, but Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel remain quiet faces. Honestly, I\u2019m not going to be able to grasp what you\u2019re thinking.\u201cSo there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to tell you or anything when I give these kids the knowledge, is there?\u201c\u2026 so it goes against the covenant not to interfere disproportionately from this one?\u201cIt\u2019s good because I\u2019m on my own. You guys haven\u2019t been passionate about spiritual contracts since then, have you?\u2026 except Grants\u2019 wife there\u201dHiraki, and Mrs Nerschel, with Llumiel\u2019s gaze on her, just smiled calmly.Well, it was enough to write such a paper, and the one who was most interested in the Spirit Contractor was Mrs. Nerschel. Still, as the Duchess, what did Lady Nerschel think of not going down the path of exploration to bring in sparks not needed in the country\u2026?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I didn\u2019t think the Spirit Contract would be a good thing to take a detour from what you were like at the time.\u201d\u201cUse it if you can, but it was your attitude, Orphans. He\u2019s the one who used to set the country up so far.\u201d\u201cI want you to stop being an impenetrable boy\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t handle the rest because I thought so.\u201d\u201cYou pushed your daughters\u2019 backs like that because you thought they had that vessel?\u201cThere were some chopped circumstances that I had to do that. I don\u2019t mind if you think so.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes. You\u2019ve become a good father, Orphans.\u201dFather blinked his eyes at Llumiel, who smiled with joy and told him. And I silenced myself on the top of the Buddha as if I had failed to choose an expression.\u201cYou think you made the right decision from my point of view. I didn\u2019t think there was a flag for a spiritual contractor for the stability of the country. I may have had a hard time, but I could see the King\u2019s Capital and be sure of it. You didn\u2019t need a spiritual contract.\u201d\u201c\u2026 not just the rest of us\u201d\u201cYep. Based on that, I\u2019m telling you you weren\u2019t wrong\u2026. so the next generation has a way of doing it. You don\u2019t have to look at me like that, do you?\u201c\u2026 but the more I warned you, the more I heard that the Spirit Contract had been clarified, the more it would come to life.\u201dFrom the flow of the conversation, I wonder if the fathers also asked for the Spirit Contractor as their flag once. But the fathers gave up taking the Spirit covenant as ours with Llumiel\u2019s warning.I wonder if that is why the covenant for Llumiel to remain in the country has been exchanged. Instead, let me promise you I won\u2019t interfere more than I have to.\u201c\u2026 then, it\u2019s Anis. Can you tell me more about the Spirit Contract?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEven though I was a little nervous, I got to talk about the spiritual covenant.The Spirit Contractor and the Great Spirit who make a covenant in the Spirit covenant. I will tell my father the relationship and the truth.The premise is that people have spirits in their souls. By entering into a covenant with the Spirit that is hidden in the soul, the Spirit Contractor dedicates the soul of man to the soul of the Spirit for a price and spiritualizes it. That it is a mechanism to promote to the Great Spirit and gain power as a Spirit Contractor.By way of conclusion: that the Spirit Contractor and the Great Spirit are the same, and that the Spirit Contractor is a being that has replaced the soul with the Spirit. And that the Great Spirit is the fruit of a spirit with a vessel of man, or of a former spiritual contractor who lost a vessel of man.First, I will explain the outline to my fathers while trying to calmly convey only the facts. Then Father and Mother\u2019s face went strong to see, and by the time I finished the story, it had dripped away.\u201c\u2026 I see Lord Ryumi warns you. Was the Spirit Contract such a mechanism\u201dgroaning as his father held his forehead down. My mother has her worried and anxious eyes pointed at Ufi.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that Uffi has already reached the Spirit Contractor\u2026 i.e. the Great Spirit?\u201cYes, I\u2019m just saying that Uffi was closer to the spirit than the Spirit from the beginning and had no significant impact, but still, I can\u2019t say that none of the changes were there\u201d\u201cUfi is no longer human,\u201d he said?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh my god!My mother leaned down with her eyes hidden with both hands. Though I didn\u2019t know much about the truth, I didn\u2019t think it was enough to stop humans. I certainly can\u2019t help feeling guilty if I think so\u2026\u2026Yufi made a spiritual covenant because, you see, it\u2019s that\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Silfi. This child became a spiritual contractor as much as possible. \u2018Cause\u2026 I made my spiritual pact, and the cut-off is a crazy fight, right?\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cI laughed too because I had a magical fight over which one would be king and I made a deal with that bounce.\u201dIn the next moment, my father and mother\u2019s gaze pierced me about what was going on. I desperately turned away.Wow, I\u2019m not bad\u2026\u2026! Yufi signed the contract on his own\u2026\u2026!\u201cSo sooner or later, this child would have fulfilled his spiritual covenant. If a parent is a parent, a child is a child again.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the way you put it, Lord Grants had the qualities to be a spiritual contractor too?I inadvertently questioned the way Llumiel said it.Sure, Lord Grants and Uffi are alike, but it sounds like Lord Grants had that possibility, too, the way Llumiel put it.\u201cRight. It just doesn\u2019t look like Grants picked it out. There must have been no hang-ups.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because I only perform my duties as a Duke\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how you stop by the Spirit if you don\u2019t take care of people\u2019s sensibilities with duties and duties. Really, what kind of daughter did you raise?\u201cMy ear hurts about that.\u201dSo for the first time Lord Grants smiles ironically bitterly. Sounds very harsh as far as I can tell. I guess Yufi had the qualities from the beginning, and the environment fuelled them. It is said that Yufi was close to the Spirit from the beginning.By the way, I\u2019m worried Mrs. Nerschel\u2019s eyes are sparkling\u2026? Oh, I had eyes. Oh, missed!? I missed my eye, that guy!?\u201cHey Mrs. Nerschel!?\u201d\u201cOh, ho, ho, I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s nothing, Princess Anisphere.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I was deluded! But I saw it! Those intimate, sparkling eyes! This guy doesn\u2019t hide his nature after all!? Speaking of which, it looks like one of those scales was hidden when I visited him before\u2026!\u201cKohon\u2026. So, Uffi, are you okay? Is there any discontent or inconvenience in becoming a spiritual contractor?\u201cYeah, no problem. Would you say it\u2019s more refreshing than before, so much so that I feel more able to behave naturally now? If there is any inconvenience, there is one\u2026\u201dSo Yufi turned the gaze that was directed at Mrs. Nerschel to her father and mother.I have a bad feeling\u2026! I accidentally take a seat and try to seize Uffi, but Uffi opened his mouth faster than that.\u201cDoes Master Anise feel delicious?\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019Stupid. Uh-huh! This, stupid, ahhhhhhhhh!Everyone is gazing at Ufi like they were surprised. I shake my neck left and right with my hands blocking Yufi\u2019s mouth.\u201cChi, no! This is the\u2026! Magic! It\u2019s about magic!!\u201d\u201cUgh, um\u2026 magic?\u201cYes! You said the Spirit has the magic that each one likes! Yufi just happens to say he likes my magic!!\u201dOh, I\u2019m stroking my chest down like my father and mother are horny enough to be.Right, suddenly my daughter is delicious! What do you say, you freak me out! I freaked out too! In a different way!!\u201cI see\u2026. Princess Anisphere by the way\u201d\u201cYes, what is it? Mrs. Nerschel.\u201d\u201cWhat is the ingestion of magic?You\u2019re not asking me with intrigue, Mrs. Nerschel. Uh-huh! Besides, the last thing I want to be asked\u2026!\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026!\u201cPfft. That\u2019s right, Mother\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be trying to answer normally!!\u201dI desperately seize again because Uffi, who has untied the restraint, is normally trying to answer.This kid has no shame or anything!? Anyway, I need to get through this\u2026!\u201cPu\u2026 ku\u2026! What are you desperate for\u2026!\u201cLumi, shut up!\u201cThat\u2019s not weird, is it? You can consume magic by touching your skin.\u201d\u201c\u2026 skin and skin contact, is it?Mrs. Nerschel is blinking like a kyoton. That\u2019s all? Like I said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not ashamed of her.\u201dWoo hoo\u2026\u2026! Oh, yeah\u2026!\u201c\u2026 what. Okay, that. You think I don\u2019t need to eat anise meat or sip blood?\u201cNo. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m unburdened because I\u2019m taking in magic\u2026. Just, hey\u201d\u201c\u2026 just?\u201cHe seems pretty greedy when it comes to his magic intake.\u201d\u201cLlumi!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. We need to report it properly, huh?Ni, you\u2019re stinging! Harassment!? Harassment!?Then Father and Mother had a difficult face to describe. I feel my gaze is kind of raw and warm\u2026\u2026!No\u2026\u2026! No, Father, Mother! Because I\u2019m still clean! Because it\u2019s still clean!!\u201c\u2026 er, that is. Well, what is it? So what you\u2019re saying is that Yuffi is delicious is about Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic, and for her magic intake, she needs to touch her skin, that is, be in contact?\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cSo, Uffi says he\u2019s greedy for ingestion of magic. \u2026 is that what it is?\u201d\u201cNo!? Probably not!?\u201d\u201cOh, what is it?\u201dOhohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohoho I\u2019m even thinking about something absolutely unnecessary\u2026!Whose fault is this, too, is Yufi\u2019s fault\u2026! I\u2019m gonna shut up because I\u2019m done explaining!\u201c\u2026 you keep moderation, Anis\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange to tell me!? It\u2019s more of a Ufi to be noticed!?\u201d\u201cYou must be an elderly man. Plus, I guess Uffi is very different than before. What are you going to do without your support?My mother scolded me. It\u2019s too unreasonable. You can cry, right? This is a boulder and I cry too!?Fluffy I went back to my seat and squatted with my knees. Bad attitude? I don\u2019t know, huh! What a meeting you have to go on your own!\u201cAgain, in the future, Uphilia wants Annis to take care of her\u2026 Next is the adoption of Uphilia that we\u2019ve been talking about\u2026\u201dI feel the air on the field getting heavy all at once. Especially showing how your father and mother have fallen asleep.\u201c\u2026 Anis, the rest of us were talking while you were gone. I wonder, for example, if there is a hand that gives the throne to the Duke of Magenta.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean transferring royalty from the present royal family to the Duke of Magenta\u2019s?\u201cMm-hmm. And I also thought that the current royal family would descend as a duke\u2026\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s a lot of backlash. Your Majesty and I have different layers of hope to gather.\u201dIt was the Duke of Grants who stated his denial in his father\u2019s proposal. Sure, even I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good.His father is a king who honors the sum, but Lord Grants is a solemn figure. It is only natural that there are different layers of people who garner support. Then on the contrary, it could disrupt the country.\u201cLet Uffi succeed to the throne in one step, or not\u2026 Then I came to the conclusion that there would still be fewer children left to adopt once.\u201d\u201cRight. I think that\u2019s still the most natural flow.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if Uffi is to be king, he must still be cut off from the house, no matter what.\u201dFather\u2019s gaze, which I tell you so severely, is directed at Uffi.Father isn\u2019t the only one. Everyone had their gaze on Ufi. Uffi, who is collecting his gaze, looks at his surroundings with a clear expression.\u201cIt\u2019s no different to my resolve. Sire.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that good?\u201cYes\u2026. but I have something to tell you before I do\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI must speak of the tragedy that can happen when the Spirit Contractor becomes king. Otherwise, it could be unacceptable where I wanted it to be. And this leads to the tragedy of the Kingdom of Palletia, the first king.\u201d\u201cWhat?Father opens his eyes to unexpected topics. Same goes for my mother. Lord Grants frowned and Master Nerschel gently put his hands on his mouth.After seeing such an ambient reaction, Ufiria shifts her gaze. At the end of that gaze is Llumiel.\u201cThat would be better for you to tell her than for me. Lumi. No, Master Lumiel.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother.\u201dLlumiel flaunts his shoulder with a bitter smile. The attention that was focused on Uffi shifts to Llumiel.Rhumiel puts his residence right and smiles invincibly with his chest stretched.\u201cShall I name you again? My real name is Llumiel Ren\u00e9 Palettia. My first king is my daughter, a living witness to the founding of my country.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61: 61If Llumiel revealed who he was and told the hidden history of the first king of the Kingdom of Palletia, the fathers would all have a difficult look on their face.My father was so surprised that if he asked me who Llumiel was, he would fall as-is. No, if I try to listen to you, I\u2019m still giving you a peek into your face as an exchanger.Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel are calmly listening to Llumiel.It was my mother who wasn\u2019t calm. My mother looked at Llumiel with an incredible, said look, and every time I listened to her, she was distorting her face with sadness.\u2026 you\u2019re talking about getting stuck when you think about it. Those who are no longer men will be kings. And at the end of the day, I can be killed inside me. I think that story has overlapped. If I did poorly, it could have come true, I think Al has already gone far.From the wishes of the people, it was not strange for the First King to follow any differences from his own desires. If you think about it, you will also seek regret for Al-Kun, and your mother and Lyumiel may think of her because she seems to be close.\u201cThis is the hidden truth of history. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I warned you not to cheap on your spiritual covenant.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I would have liked you to have warned me more clearly, but I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201dFather groans when his temples are reduced so as to reduce the headache. And face up without force, and gaze toward Uffi.\u201c\u2026 you think they can talk like this and say you\u2019re a king or something? Ufilia.\u201d\u201cYes. Still, let me state. That\u2019s why I should be king. From the time of L\u00fcmiel to the present, this country sanctified the feats of the first kings, whose reality is unclear. It is true that it has led to faith in spirits and magic and has supported the country.\u201dBut take a breath and Uffi continues. I\u2019m not lost in Uffi\u2019s eyes stating my thoughts.\u201cThe luck of faith in magic and the Spirit is growing among the nobles of the Kingdom of Palettia. I find this impending to the point where it could once again recall the tragedy of the First King. Magic becomes the authority of the nobility, and spiritual faith guarantees the authority of the nobility. Once that admiration has passed, it is turning into arrogance, and cracks are beginning to arise between us and a people who have no magical benefit. But without the people, they are not nobles, and without nobility, the people lose their guidance. We have to prevent this fracture at all costs.\u201d\u201c\u2026 um. I can see that. But isn\u2019t it a sign of the retrograde nature of the times that you bear witness to the king with your spiritual covenant?\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I end it. The Spirit covenant made me the last king to strike this truth upon my country and imitate old customs.\u201dYuffi puts her hands on her chest and looks over at everyone with her spine pinched.\u201cWe are the successors to the greatness of the First King. The philosophy of the first king is for the people, not for the spiritual or magical faith. You rightly inherit the truth once forgotten and reborn your country. We have to get out of this system in order to correctly inherit the philosophy of the First King.\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you deny faith\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not denying all of that. If you deny all of the magic, it will lead you to deny the foundation of the Kingdom of Palettia as well. So we should pray based on the right and true. There is no will in the Spirit, and he says that the Spirit\u2019s guidance is the desire, faith, and faith itself that he asks inside himself. It is only when that prayer is right and when it comes to receiving it that the path of spiritual covenant will be opened. But picking up even the most insistent wishes is personal, and it\u2019s not a political policy.\u201dSpirit faith may remain apart. But there\u2019s no reason to leave it as a political policy. He said that kings and nobles should only be for the stability of the country. That\u2019s why I just want to change the current system with magic as my authority.That\u2019s what me and Uffi want. Different means, same place to go.\u201cIf we just get out of the current system, we\u2019ll be able to do it even if Master Anis becomes king. But it is impossible to suppress rebellion with Master Anis. Master Anis has no justification in magic. Making a persuasion doesn\u2019t create the necessary persuasion. If I do, I will only shred my habits by becoming king. Because I deserve it.\u201dEveryone is silent on Yufi\u2019s powerful proclamation, and each is held back by ideas.\u201c\u2026 may I have a word from you, too?In the air we all worry about, Lumiel speaks out to draw attention to herself.Llumiel opens his mouth again after making sure his gaze gathers.\u201cI think the Palletian kingdom is thriving right now. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m proud of you, but it\u2019s a good match for our time in terms of how happy the people seem. If there is a difference, it is not politics by individuals. Once the first king, my father, carried the wishes of the people alone. At the end of it, the greed of the people drove me crazy.\u201dLlumiel flaunts his shoulders and tells the facts. Perhaps only pale cares for her grieving mother. Because that gaze was directed at my mother several times.\u201cThis country doesn\u2019t have to save everything by itself anymore. Everyone can think, discuss and hold hands. The time has come. So at least I don\u2019t think I need an old time feat anymore. Sure, I\u2019m glad you said you\u2019d carry on, but I don\u2019t want that to shackle you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 lumi\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s good to be saved, even a king\u2026. so I killed your father with this hand. Your father would never have been saved if you kept going like that. So I covered up the truth about the Spirit Contractor. To avoid repeating the same mistakes again.\u201dSilence comes again when Llumiel finishes his words\u2026. It was my father who broke the silence.\u201cWhy bother at all in the rest of the time\u2026?\u201cYour Majesty, your mouth is overflowing with boulders.\u201d\u201cI know. Wow, Grants! If you\u2019ve come this far, I\u2019ll brace your stomach!Lord Grants embarrasses Father Blur, who was holding his head like a pain. Besides, I take my seat while Father gives it back to me in frustration.\u201cNow this country needs a new breeze. But it must never be meant to cut off the past from the present. It can also be said about the relationship between the nobles of this country and the nobles and the people.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cThe rest\u2026 I could only be a heavy stone for everyone not to dispute. I didn\u2019t have the power to change times. But if I can be patient and praise you for connecting so far, then I want to believe that my governance would have made sense.\u201d\u2026 Wherever you look at it with your chest up, you\u2019re a fine king, Father.\u201cAnisphere.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd, Uphilia\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI want to entrust the future to you. Ask on it\u2026. which one will be king?I grabbed my fist when I asked.I came to the point of answering. I close my eyes to the feeling of my stomach shrinking.\u201cAnis.\u201dFather calls me. Open your eyes and look at your father.I had straight eyes. Just staring at me, waiting for words.I\u2019ve been thinking about it until I got here. What should I do? What do you want to do? Do what\u2019s right all the time.I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure. Still, only this answer has to be answered with a strained chest. Exhale. Face back firmly so that your voice doesn\u2019t tremble.\u201c-\u2026 I can\u2019t be king\u201d\u2026 I said.I said it.\u201c\u2026 but\u201dThe back of my eye is hot. But the words that follow are heavily caught in my throat.The truth is, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to say. Until you get here, just think about it.I was scared. I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve been scared\u2026. because if you don\u2019t say it here, you\u2019ll probably lose your chance forever.\u201cIf I could be, I wanted to be.\u201d\u201c\u2026 anise?\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be king, I wanted to be who I could be. As your daughters, keep your breasts up.\u201dI have thoughts that Yufi pointed out to me and I realized. I am Anisphere Wynn Palettia. But its contents weren\u2019t intact. I have memories of someone else, and as a person in this country, I am a heretic child with an insane mindset.I thought it was \u201cfake\u201d deep down. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not real. I couldn\u2019t use magic because I was the one. That\u2019s an irresistible fact, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why I should have disappeared. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like who I am right now.Still, I wish. If magic could normally be used, I wonder if anyone could live without suffering\u2026. That was really distressing.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be king because I didn\u2019t think I could, and I didn\u2019t like it, and that\u2019s fine if Al succeeds. I don\u2019t want Al to have a seat that belongs to me. But if I\u2019m the only one left, I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201dPoirot, and tears fell. I can\u2019t stand it if I want to. I just spin my words with care that I still can\u2019t just let my voice tremble.If such a delusion had come true. If I could fit everything together. If I wasn\u2019t me. I really think about that possibility.It was all because I had Yufi to carry me, to make my father and mother suffer, and to take my family away from both Alkun and Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel. Such an idea crawls over to my neck.\u201cYou annoyed everyone because of me\u2026 me, can I be forgiven\u2026?If I hadn\u2019t been me, it would have all gone well.I can\u2019t keep that thought wiped off forever.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Anis\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI told you before. There were plenty of opportunities if I were to rehabilitate you. I\u2019m the one who took the opportunity. You don\u2019t have to carry it on yourself.\u201d\u201cIt was before that. If I had been born from the beginning as a true princess who could use magic, not me\u2026 yes, I would think.\u201d\u201cBut if it weren\u2019t for you, magic would not have been born. And no one may have ever had doubts about spiritual faith. That could have led to the repetitive consequences of the tragedy of the First King. There\u2019s no point in assuming you\u2019re not you.\u201dI know that too. Now is the only time. I know. I\u2019m still looking for a reason.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dWhen did you take your seat, instead of earlier, Uffi holds my shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cWhat you wanted to be forgiven for was easier.\u201d\u2026 what, in a way that I know better than I do.But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not mistaken. I seem to be oblivious to my feelings after all.If I don\u2019t get Yufi\u2019s help, I\u2019ll miss what I\u2019m really looking for myself.\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be king, there\u2019s no point in being a princess\u2026. What you were afraid of was that you wouldn\u2019t even be able to stay with your daughter?My vision blurred at Yufi\u2019s inquiry. Because the amount of tears increased at once.\u201cNo matter how much I thought I was the daughter of His Majesty and the Queen, I thought\u2026 the proof seemed few to you. So I doubt it. I try to keep the connection I have now. Because I want to remain my daughter. Different?\u2026 no.Tears fall. My chest is filled with thoughts. Regret and guilt seem to tear my chest apart every second of every day, and I shudder at Yufi.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of not being a parent or a child. You\u2019ve always been afraid to take your daughter from your Majesty and Queen, haven\u2019t you? For who I am. Still, I can\u2019t stop myself. It\u2019s been hard on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ooh, ooh\u2026!I hope you don\u2019t reveal it. But I can\u2019t help but relieve myself of the thought of being worded and shaped. Such a contradiction.But I still want you to know. I think so. If I\u2019m weak and you don\u2019t understand, if I\u2019m not needed, I won\u2019t ask for it either. Don\u2019t seek, I have been so deluded and mean.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fake it anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because of me, always annoying, al-kun, suffer\u2026! If I\u2019m stunned, I have to be expected, I can be free\u2026 If I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t breathe, but I can\u2019t help but bend myself and wish I hadn\u2019t disappeared like that, it\u2019s hard, it was hard!I couldn\u2019t have said this without Yufi\u2019s support. This is my weakness. I thought it was something I should never show you.\u201cMy father and mother respected me. I\u2019ve always felt it was for me, even if it was tough on me. All I can do is betray it. It\u2019s always been\u2026 bitter and\u2026! You can\u2019t tell me\u2026 you can\u2019t tell me\u2026! I can\u2019t even stop being me, but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m accepting\u2026 it\u2019s just my best\u2026!\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just glad you complimented me. If I were to tell you to be king, I wanted to respond. That\u2019s the only reason why I could be my daughter\u2026\u2026!Magic is my pride. But all I have is magic. That was all I had. If that\u2019s unacceptable\u2026\u2026 what\u2019s it worth to me?No matter how much Father and Mother acknowledge, I would be ineligible as a princess if the state did not. I can\u2019t be the king the country doesn\u2019t want. I can\u2019t be. That\u2019s what I can\u2019t do without killing my heart.I thought how many times I\u2019d dump this country. I thought if you didn\u2019t need it many times, throw it away. Still, it\u2019s the two of us who are my parents who have been so nice to me.Far from the shape we wanted, we were family. I wanted to be with my family. With your father, with your mother, with Al. I tore my family apart like that. I can\u2019t fix it completely\u2026 it was just painful.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be king! You don\u2019t want to be! Why would you be king if everyone wouldn\u2019t admit it? But if I tell you to be, I\u2019ll make you admit it, if you are! But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not! I just wanted you to laugh! I wish everyone would have laughed! I just wanted the magic to make everyone happy! And yet you can\u2019t even use the magic you asked for, and even if you find a replacement, it\u2019s derogatory! Then tell me what to do! What was I supposed to do!?\u201d\u2026 I spit it all out. What was accumulating in my heart. That was painful, but it got lighter. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s unusual. This is how I really feel.You could have been king if you were to be recognized. Because I can\u2019t admit it, I didn\u2019t want to be king until I pushed those unacknowledged people away. Because that\u2019s not my ideal.Such a child\u2019s eclampsia. It\u2019s not good for me to say it. Still, this is what I meant when I couldn\u2019t fake it. I can\u2019t tell you, I\u2019ve been hiding it\u2026 it\u2019s my wound.\u201cYou must have been too kind. You\u2019re too kind to be nice to yourself.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Hold Yuffi tight as he holds my head in. I get caught up in the warmth.If you don\u2019t have to work hard anymore. If you don\u2019t have to be king\u2026. Is it good to stay like this? If I don\u2019t have to deserve to be king, can I be forgiven for that? If I\u2019m not even allowed to do that, I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201c\u2026 What the hell is a country that has to be king until you make someone like this cry? If you want to, why didn\u2019t you notice that you were crying? If you don\u2019t want to, but you want me to be king, what\u2019s that for? That\u2019s what I think. Sire.\u201dUnexpectedly grab Yuffi\u2019s arm. I\u2019m not crying because I want you to tell your father that. It\u2019s just that I\u2026 wanted a place where I could stay weak.I can\u2019t hurt anyone, I can\u2019t hurt anyone. I just wanted a place like that. So if there was a small world out there, I would be happy with it\u2026. I was satisfied.\u201cIf we all don\u2019t want kings, we just need them. I\u2019ll take it. If you want me to be the one to lead this country. That\u2019s why I was raised.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 oh yeah\u201dI hear your father whining. I\u2019m too scared to see what you look like.\u201c\u2026 I thought you were a laborious daughter, but that was my immorality that wasted my time\u201d\u201c\u2026 no, it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want you to think that way. Because I still couldn\u2019t change\u2026\u2026!\u201cIf it can change, then so be it\u2026. but you couldn\u2019t obey the Spirit. If a country is abused for\u201d just that, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell me what it\u2019s for.\u201dFather groans without power. Then there was the sound of something hitting the desk with momentum.\u201c\u2026 Huh, we should still have reformed it! No matter how much blood you bleed!It was my mother who beat my desk vigorously. My mother chewed off her lips and was shaking if I raised my face to too much noise. You tapped that fist with the momentum of smashing your desk, with fragments scattered.\u201cWe sent it first! I didn\u2019t think that was a mistake. When the time comes for our governance, and until the time it sprouts, it is right\u2026 and that\u2019s why I endured! That\u2019s it! It\u2019s normal for a royal child to carry it\u2026!\u201c\u2026 Mother. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u2026\u201d\u201cStill you cry!? I wish you would have blamed me for that, that it was my fault you were born without magic! Why, Anisphere\u2026! Algardo too! I still look out and just defend my country\u2026 I can\u2019t protect you guys!!\u201dTears are transmitted on her mother\u2019s cheek, trembling as she leans down. No, that\u2019s not what I want you to say\u2026!\u201cStill, that\u2019s why I hate it when your mother says you should have bled! I couldn\u2019t help it, I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026!\u201cYeah, I am. As Ennis said, there\u2019s always no choice in the country.\u201dIt was Llumiel who spoke out in a grumpy manner. Soon she stopped by her mother\u2019s side and slapped her mother on the shoulder.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to discuss it\u2026. you just need to talk a little bit. If I look at you, I\u2019ll see. What was wrong was that I couldn\u2019t walk away. And it must be a custom from the past not to allow that. It is neither the past nor regret that you should change. It\u2019s a reality, isn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 lumi, but\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing there! You guys are still exchanging words like this, but you can even regret it, but you just cry peach-perchic!?\u201dShut off your mother\u2019s words about to say something, catch your eyes and Rhumiel yells.\u201cRegret as much as you can! Not while I can! If you\u2019re gonna mourn, you can do as much later as you want! Freedom to immerse! You\u2019re also free to move on! But hey!\u2026 I\u2019ve never had a good time holding him by myself.\u201d\u2026 My ear hurts.If you think about Llumiel\u2019s past, it also hurts my chest just to imagine what thoughts are in there.\u201c\u2026 in terms of parenting, we\u2019ve all failed.\u201dHuh, the pompous and the head of the Sprout Knights muttered. The Knights captain, who has been holding back until now, is scratching his head casually.\u201cI don\u2019t want to blame the Ministry of Magic, but honestly, don\u2019t want to resent me. It\u2019s true that we were being held by them.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026. I just thought you should grow up tough to entrust the next era to your child.\u201dIt is Lord Grants who whines to the Knights of Sprout to be in tune. Only Lord Grants is as usual. This situation makes me horrified by the immovable Lord Grants.\u201cWe abandoned our personal desire to stabilize the country. I don\u2019t see that as a mistake\u2026\u2026. but it must have been a mistake to impose that on the kids. You had a falling out on us for not being able to identify a change in time. But that\u2019s also another reckless statement to make evil of everything the Magic Ministry does, right? Matthew.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know, but hey\u201d\u201cAt least it was the Ministry of Magic that made a significant contribution to the unity of will in the country. Therefore, it was difficult to reduce the impact of those seeking to enter the educational setting\u2026\u201d\u201cAs a result, there is no point in causing a crisis in the country\u2026. we should have known that we were self-satisfied and the country was immobile.\u201d\u2026 The Dukes of Magenta always pass by, and I don\u2019t know, the other way around, I\u2019m relieved.My mother also restored her composure, wiping her tears to correct her residence.\u201cStill, I hate it now\u2026 because it was definitely the Ministry of Magic that drove Anisphere as well as Algard\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s an adult job to restrain that movement. It must still be our unrighteousness.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026. Ha, sorry to hear that.\u201d\u201cIf you stand on the battlefield, the crying child or the silent queen, are you the son of man in the political arena?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Matthew, if it\u2019s a fight, I\u2019ll buy it, okay?\u201cI miss this interaction, too\u2026. At the end of the day, what we didn\u2019t have is words. We\u2019ve spared words to understand each other.\u201dThe head of the Sprout Knights squeaks with a self-inflicted grin. Maybe that\u2019s what I thought of Navre.Fathers\u2019 times were painful. So we abandoned our own personal desires and just ran for the good of our country. But it didn\u2019t all work out. I\u2019m sure even your fathers are just the result of thinking that the next generation won\u2019t be in trouble.That didn\u2019t mesh with the times. I really wasted a lot of time having to get my hands on that unmeshing gear to mesh. That\u2019s what you should regret.\u201c\u2026 I think. It\u2019s self-explanatory.\u201d\u201cUfi?\u201d\u201cIf we can live by faith alone, do we need others there? Facing oneself is the essence of a spiritual covenant. Do you need to exchange words with others if you only need to keep facing yourself as a virtue and follow the teachings of shapeless idols? I only know when, and I think it was poisoned.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Miss Uphilia, if you say faith is poisoned, then the great man in the Ministry of Magic will turn his face bright red, won\u2019t you?\u201cIf the pills pass, you said poison, right?Yufi says it all the time. Wow, I\u2019m totally in poison tongue mode\u2026\u2026Lord Grants is turning his gaze to Uffi to see something delightful. Already, this parent and child\u2026!\u201c\u2026 I understand the story very well. Anise has a heavy load. Let\u2019s say, then, that we still proceed with the policy of making Uffi king. Is that good enough for you? It\u2019s Ufilia.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m not lost\u201dHuh! Or when I said it with my shoulder hugged, it was taken in a weird way!? Natural!? On purpose!? Oh, and I\u2019m disappointed, so I can\u2019t get away with it!\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s Anis\u201d\u201cUgh! Yes!\u201c\u2026 if you say an apology, you\u2019ll be annoyed. There is no need to prove which is worse than the rubbing difference so far. So you live well. That\u2019s all I hoped for as a parent. That\u2019s all I can do is lie or I can stretch my chest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Father\u201dI\u2019m bound to pull my lips into Father\u2019s words and bite them. Otherwise I was going to cry all the time.\u201c\u2026 how much have I seen you cry?\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t even count. In the sense that I don\u2019t remember. That\u2019s pathetic\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I have caused you scattered inconvenience. Because I knew, I couldn\u2019t shamelessly imitate crying.\u201d\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve always wanted that. Make it tough and you turn it up. But you pierced yourself. I just saw the strength, and I misunderstood it was you.\u201dMother shakes her head quietly to the left and right\u2026. I don\u2019t want to open my mouth anymore. You\u2019re opening your eyes, because tears are melting and it\u2019s hard.\u201cAlgardo must have had a lot to say to me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I apologize for being stubborn with all of them\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026. It\u2019s okay, Anis. From now on, let\u2019s start one by one. One more time from here, huh?My mother\u2019s gentle voice leaks an irrepressible voice from the back of her throat.I can\u2019t afford to spin words anymore, and I can\u2019t keep my eyes open. I could just keep crying, keeping my body supported by Uffi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hey, you got a word from me about the throne, too?It was Llumiel who waited until I settled in crying scattered and then cut out the subject so.Attention was drawn to Llumiel, who cut out the topic, and it was up to her mother to tilt her neck.\u201cWhat is a word?\u201cIt is the will of these children for Uffi to be king, and I don\u2019t mind if you are good. You don\u2019t have the right or the right to tell me anyway in the first place. Just one thing, this is the spiritual contractor\u2019s advice.\u201dFather tightens his expression to the word advice. As the tension runs, Rhumiel breaks his face.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about getting into that. But in the future, when it comes to the right to inherit the throne, it\u2019s going to be a lot easier, isn\u2019t it? I know you\u2019re going to have a problem with that, but what I\u2019m going to say is about the future of Uffi and Anis.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ours?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you realize how dependent you are on each other\u2019s existence?Ugh. Why are we talking about that? If you look unwittingly disgusted, you flaunt your shoulders like Llumiel says you have no choice.\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that you are pairs at the earliest. But we have a position, don\u2019t we? You can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t move to tear you apart in that position.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dYufi replied carelessly, but I was afraid of my eyes. Um, you don\u2019t have to grab it, do you? Yufi? It hurts a little, doesn\u2019t it?\u201cThere, I don\u2019t react like that doesn\u2019t matter. Yuffi may not care, but if he asks me if I\u2019m going to imitate that around him, then I\u2019m not, am I? But for you, it\u2019s a matter of life and death. At a time when Yufi prefers the magic of Anis, you are a Lotus of Trustees. If you want to defend that relationship, you have to strike your hand first.\u201d\u201cHitting my hand\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. Tell them to publish your relationship properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 hahhhh!?\u201dWhat a public execution! I mean, me and Uffi, you know, we\u2019re dating, so we can officially announce this!?\u201cI don\u2019t mind that, but are we talking about pushing that far?\u201cI\u2019ll be fine!? I\u2019ll be fine!?\u201d\u201cAnis shut up. Even if they think there\u2019s a gap between women in the first place, right? If you say so, it\u2019s your turn to acknowledge each other with your souls. Go ahead and tell your pop opponent there\u2019s no clearance to break in. From the beginning.\u201d\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming\u201dMmmmmmmm\u2026\u2026! Oh, that\u2019s true\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not going to be told either, and I think the guy who tells Uffi to get kicked by a horse. Then I suppose we\u2019ll make our relationship public first.\u201c\u2026 I thought that would happen, but then don\u2019t bother the next king\u201d\u201cI figured I might be an adopted child\u2026 I can\u2019t say I can\u2019t make a precedent with Ufi\u2026\u201dHa, and Father and Mother sighed. Yes, yes, I\u2019m sorry! Make it easy! It\u2019s me, it\u2019s me!\u201cYou can make it, kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u2026 Llumiel, what did you say now? Am I losing my ear?\u201cSo you inherited it, didn\u2019t you? You just have to make something else.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no, I don\u2019t have someone!?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Could it be that I\u2019m telling you to make it with Yufi!?\u201d\u201cYou have other options than that?What are you talking about? You look like that, but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about when you say it from me, because it\u2019s Lumiel! See, everyone else looks just like me!? It\u2019s Lumiel who says things out of common sense!?\u201cAre you going to tell me that you can\u2019t have children because they\u2019re women or something like that?\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a yes or no because it\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s a natural pregnancy, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no way, is there?\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cWell, if you say you can\u2019t be king unless you\u2019re born in the business of nature, you can adopt a son\u2026. What, you don\u2019t like it?\u201cIt\u2019s too sudden to catch up with my thoughts! Don\u2019t talk in your own common sense!\u201c\u2026 Master Anis can say that\u2026?Shut up, Raini! It\u2019s a matter of life and death for me! And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I like it and ignore or break common sense\u2026 it\u2019s not because\u2026\u2026\u2026 I also think there is common sense to protect! Yes! I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s convenient! This is a rounding choice, yes it is a rounding choice!!\u201cI mean, besides the business of men and women, does Master Rhumi know how to give you children?\u201cThere are a few of them, right?\u201cA few!There! Mrs. Nerschel, don\u2019t eat! Sit down, please, because I know very well that your desire for knowledge has been stimulated! Don\u2019t make your eyes sparkle!!Or some!? I was fantasizing about this world more than I thought!? Like I want to hear it, I don\u2019t want to hear it\u2026!!\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d\u201cYeah, fix it.\u201d\u201cHuh!? Father, Mother, do you want to clap back there?\u201d\u201cIt will be an unprecedented succession to the throne in the first place. In addition, your magic will only be accepted with a wide heart, no matter what happens\u2026. the rest of you will have given up your throne then!\u201cAwful! How irresponsible!\u201cIt\u2019s not you who\u2019s irresponsible! After swinging around! Come on, think about sitting down!Ugh, ugly\u2026! can\u2019t argue\u2026!\u201cBut look, not if that\u2019s a foreign law or something!?!?\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s such a law?\u201cLlumiel, shut up!\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t like making kids with Uffi that much?\u201cYa meh! Open the door and don\u2019t talk to me! It\u2019s a delicate story!?\u201dMainly ethics, my heart, shame! It\u2019s delicate!?As she was stuffing herself with Rhumiel\u2019s words, Yufi caught her from behind and held her tight. Guh, guh, my neck is squeezed\u2026\u2026!\u201cPlease calm down, Master Anis. I\u2019m not talking about anything right now.\u201d\u201cYu, Yufi\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think even if I inherit the country, I should take a verdict on whether or not to leave my blood behind. So if you want to leave it, you just have to figure out what to do, and I think we should discuss in the country whether we should adopt a child. You don\u2019t have to decide anything between us, do you?\u201c\u2026 why is Yufi so calm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat will be the mindset we need as kings. I know your majesty and queen will be worried too, but Master Anis is a beginner and cute person who is not immune to this hand story. Don\u2019t hunt him down too much.\u201d\u201cDear Uphilia! You\u2019re stabbing me in the face!?\u201dKill me! Kill me already!! Raini\u2019s scratch hurts my chest too!! Why do I have to be so humiliated! Return me, return me to the palace!! I\u2019ll take you to the cage already!! What did you know about the throne!!\u201cWhat. You don\u2019t have to worry about me, do you?\u201cShut up! Whose fault do you think it is, Lumiel\u2019s idiot!!\u201d\u2026 This happened, but the issue of our right to inherit the throne was thus agreed between us.Uffi will be adopted by his father and mother. And officially give the right to inherit the throne, and together announce the truth about the Spirit covenant. After the announcement, it was decided to take the verdict of the nobles once again.Depending on the outcome, it will change again, but by all means, Uphilia will move to become king.It\u2019s good that the conversation was wrapped up and dissolved, but for some reason, me and Yuffi were to be taken to the Duke of Magenta house by Lady Nerschel.\u201cIf Uffi were officially adopted by His Majesty, he\u2019d be out of touch with us, wouldn\u2019t he? Well, then, at least let me take the time to talk to you until you feel comfortable at the end, okay?If you say so, it\u2019s hard to say no even to me. Raini asked me to leave the palace to report to Ilia, so I was the only one who came to the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house.Plus, I\u2019m staying today, so I totally treat you like a customer. Hmm, I\u2019m not comfortable when I say I\u2019m not comfortable because I\u2019ve never received much welcome like this\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a shame though. I can\u2019t believe Uffi found someone to admire from the bottom of his heart, but he\u2019s soon out of touch\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no choice. Don\u2019t talk too much.\u201d\u201cI know. But it\u2019s a real shame. Wow\u2026 even though Master Anis might have seemed like my daughter\u2026\u201dLady Nerschel spits out her thoughts like a real spare in the carriage to the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house. Lord Grants to blame for that, but make him see compassion and see that the couple is good.I\u2019m going to keep my precious daughter from those two. I feel completely different from when I came to say hello before, so I\u2019m even more restless. Even though time had not passed since then, everything seemed to change dramatically.\u201cWhen the situation settles, it will also be possible to exchange words face-to-face, even if the edges cannot be restored. Until then, please be patient, Mother.\u201d\u201cYep. You\u2019re my daughter, Yufi. I\u2019ve always thought of you.\u201dGently smiling at each other, Yufi and Mrs. Nerschel. Lord Grants is watching those two quietly. I have trouble pinching my mouth for parent-child conversations and am just silent.While doing so, the carriage stops at the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house. I got off the carriage at Lord Grants\u2019 escort and went inside and the servants were waiting for me to welcome them.\u201cWelcome home, sir.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m back now. Take some time to talk. Tell Caind to show his face too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in awe\u201dThe butler gives Lord Grants the courtesy of directing him before gracefully walking away. Caindo-kun\u2019s name made me round my eyes a little bit. Though I think I have to explain, I was wondering if you were going to let me be there.You felt the gaze of my doubt, Lord Grants gazing at me. Nothing in particular to say, Lord Grants only nods once and walks ahead.Hmm\u2026 It\u2019s not like I have to pinch my mouth, but I have to say something. Without further ado, I was guided to a room where I had a tea party with Master Nerschel.When you enter the guest room first and wait, Caindo-kun will be informed that you have arrived. Caindo-kun, who came into the guest room to continue, looks somewhat discouraged.\u2026\u2026 hmm? Could this have been squeezed after our last visit?When I turned my gaze to Kaindo-kun like I was suspicious, he looked me in the eye that seemed kind of complicated. It\u2019s confusing, then it\u2019s an eye that wonders if we should rebel. I\u2019m in trouble for being turned around like that\u2026\u2026\u201cCaind, sit down.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, Father\u201dLord Grants prompts Kaindo-kun to take his seat\u2026. Ugh, it\u2019s not air to laugh and have fun chatting. But there is a limit to the amount of time you can have as a family for Uffi and for the House of the Duke of Magenta.Even Lord Grants is on official business, and Yuffi needs to be ready to be adopted to inherit the throne. That will inevitably keep me busy. This could be the last time.\u201cCaind, listen carefully. This is a matter of decision.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what is it?\u201cIt has been decided that Ufilia will be adopted by the royal family.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?Why, as Caindo-kun said, he looks up. Lord Grants tells only the facts pale in return for such a caind.\u201cThis has been a secret story with the royal family for a long time, but given the current state of the country, there was a voice for prophecy that Princess Anisphere\u2019s reign had concerns that would lead to the rebellion of the country. That\u2019s where the white feather arrow stood. From now on, Uphilia will become a member of the royal family by becoming an adopted child and will be granted the right to inherit the throne.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dI can\u2019t believe it, Kaindo-kun looks back at Yufi like he said. Yuffi is sipping tea without anything in particular on his face.\u201cDid your father tolerate such impotence\u2026?\u201cUnhelpful or nothing, it was Uphilia who brought it up. Sure, I offered a choice as one of my measures, but I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s why I told Uphilia to cut off the edge of the house.\u201d\u201c\u2026 did you already talk about that during your previous visit?\u201cThis story is about a medical examination from Uphilia when Prince Algard was abandoned.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes, is it\u201dKaindo-kun bit his lip and leaned down. I think the fist I put on my lap is probably gripped hard.I can only ask how everyone is doing with the air that doesn\u2019t pinch my mouth. Aside from Caindo-kun, the faces of the Duke of Magenta house are just pale. Hey, I\u2019m kind of stuck breathing. The difference between this house and when it\u2019s off and on is too intense\u2026\u201c\u2026 So you think your sister will no longer be part of the Duke\u2019s family?\u201cIt will.\u201d\u201cBut His Majesty let such impotence pass? I don\u2019t think I can give you the throne instead of Princess Anisphere\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is still top secret. Recently, an official announcement has been made that Uphilia will be named as the Spirit Contractor.\u201d\u201cBecome\u2026\u201dTake a breath and look like Kaindo-kun eats into Yufi\u2019s face. Yufi doesn\u2019t seem to show interest in Kaindo-kun and doesn\u2019t gaze at him. Hey, I feel some sign of a cold war. Honestly, my stomach hurts. It makes me crisp.\u201cTo gain no less persuasion than direct lineage. That was the condition for Uphilia to be adopted. Ufiria, who accomplished great deeds, was allowed to take his name to the royal family. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but wasn\u2019t your father pushing Princess Anisphere?\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s not like you can accept me and your daughter off the hook. But if Yufi wants it strongly and accomplishes great deeds, he can only send it out as a parent. As a duke, it\u2019s a place to look around. Then you\u2019ll be someone else in red.\u201dWow, Lord Grants is smiling scared and watching Uffi! You look intimidated, you\u2019re scared! Take that. Uffi\u2019s laughing thinly, too! I don\u2019t know! Magenta family. Communicate. I don\u2019t know!\u201cAnd Princess Anisphere\u2026 is too sick to stand as king. Not with this.\u201dYikes!? That\u2019s where you talk about me!? And they treat me like a sick person!?Caindo-kun\u2019s gaze can be directed at me. That\u2019s a bewildering gaze. No, I\u2019m also suddenly confused about being treated like a sick person!?\u201cThis country was too strong for Princess Anisphere. At the earliest, everything was too late to make you stand as king of this country.\u201d\u201cOh, you know, Lord Grants\u2026 care? You care, don\u2019t you? I appreciate that, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to mislead Caindkun that Yufi gave you a name\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say yes\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Hey!? Why would Lord Grants and Yuffi admit it!?See, that makes you think Kaindo-kun used Ufi to wipe the royal ass again!?\u201cWhat do you say this country has done to Princess Anisphere, Father?\u2026 If you say to embarrass the unknown, I will save you a lot, but I can\u2019t really grasp the story\u201d\u201cThen I ask\u2026 did you honestly rejoice when Princess Anisphere was to stand as king?Kaindo-kun frowned at Lord Grants\u2019s inquiry. He looked at me and saw how it was going. Well, there\u2019s something I think about that, isn\u2019t there?No, it\u2019s nothing good. Even I didn\u2019t expect to be greeted by a king with all my heart\u2026\u201cPrincess Anisphere will not say whether or not to come this far and elaborate her mood. Be honest with your heart, Cain.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I was not anxious. It was always whispered that Princess Anisphere was disqualified as royal. And if you can\u2019t handle magic, I think you should welcome your excellent son-in-law and set up a king.\u201d\u201cHmm. A lot of people in this country would think that way. If Uffi had been surrounded there as an assistant, the attitude of Princess Anisphere, who had refused to marry for so long, would have gone unnoticed.\u201d\u2026 That\u2019s really awful when they say it again, me in the past. I don\u2019t have any regrets, but do you mean you can see through the idea that I don\u2019t care about anyone else a while ago?But even if I could start over, I don\u2019t think I could bend. I might be able to stand around a little better, but I think I categorically disagreed with welcoming my son-in-law.\u201cIf they say it\u2019s an impossible story to stand that Princess Anisphere as king, it is. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong. But let me tell you something, you\u2019re just clouding your eyes with rumors up there, Caind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So why does Father push Princess Anisphere?\u201cBecause Princess Anisphere possesses a similar gift of hope. Its value is not comparable to mine or anything else. I think even Uphilia would be sumptuous in a way.\u201dSuddenly something awesome was lifted. Oh, what!? Lord Grants, you appreciated me so much!? It\u2019s my first ear!?\u201cNeither do I strongly deny the assessment that I have not fulfilled my duties as royal, as you put it, as disqualified as royal. But who do you think tolerated that? Caind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Are you trying to say that His Majesty himself has acknowledged it?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Did you wonder if Prince Algard wanted me to be that strong and royal just because Princess Anisphere was talented? On the contrary, Princess Anisphere was driven from her duties as royalty because she risked being wanted by the king, even without magic.\u201dUh, yeah. Is that what happens to the stories around there\u2026? Your father said so, didn\u2019t he?Because I don\u2019t want to be an obstacle to Al, either\u2026. Speaking of which, you\u2019ve always wondered.\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m in the middle of a story. I\u2019m afraid Lord Grants can appreciate me that much too\u2026?I think Lord Grants has appreciated me for a long time. It\u2019s Lord Grants, if you think he brought up the story of restoring the right to inherit the throne.But I don\u2019t think Lord Grants and I have that much contact, but I don\u2019t know what the hell they value. I couldn\u2019t help but pinch my mouth to that question.\u201cI thought the question was natural. That recognition of Princess Anisphere is the poison we\u2019ve been feeding her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes? Poison?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s poison that erodes you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m aware of it because it\u2019s something I take the initiative to drink.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re not talking about actual poison, are you?\u201c\u201d Nobody expects you to \u201c\u2026. even that kind of poison\u201dGeez, and my heart almost stopped like it was grabbed., and his breath gets painful and he grabs his chest.It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s certainly a poison that\u2019s eroding me. Yufi, who was sitting next to me, took her seat and held my shoulder. I\u2019m horrified to hear Uffi\u2019s heart sound.But I was surprised. I didn\u2019t expect this to happen when someone else told me again.Lord Grants stares quietly at me. I don\u2019t even know what emotions are hidden behind those eyes, deep eyes. I was unexpectedly freaked out.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s certainly not an exaggeration to say poison though. But I was the one who took the initiative and acted unexpectedly, wasn\u2019t I?\u201cJust conveniently riding it, we were definitely the ones in charge of politics who poisoned you enough to push yourself\u2026. apologize for that dishonesty, then let\u2019s bow our heads again. If it wasn\u2019t for this opportunity, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to elaborate on my mood.\u201dWell, Lord Grants narrows his eyes.\u201cI valued you very much. That has also been since childhood. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t have put you up to this situation. I was so afraid of you that you were my greatest political opponent.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no!?\u201dSuddenly, what are you saying, Lord Grants!? Why am I Lord Grants\u2019 biggest political enemy?!? What do you mean you\u2019ve been afraid of such a little girl since you were a child!?\u201cAre you surprised\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m surprised\u2026!? Oh, let me, explain! Request an explanation!\u201cYou must already be aware of that. It\u2019s really simple, it\u2019s just that.\u201d\u2026\u2026Oh, I don\u2019t know. What is consciousness\u2026?I\u2019ll take a look at Uffi like I\u2019m in trouble. Then, as if to revenge, Lord Grants has Yufi who is stripping his fangs and he gets gnawed.If you look at Mrs. Nerschel like you\u2019re in a hurry, you\u2019re hiding your expression with your hands on your mouth. What, this temperature difference!? Maybe Caind is the only one who thinks the same about me!?\u201c\u2026 Dad, you used to say this to me, didn\u2019t you? Said he saw the ideal for Lady Annis. He wants me to be king because I recognize its value.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m not lying\u201dIs that why?\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201c That\u2019s why. \u201c\u201cWhat, hey, Yufi! Explain it! I\u2019m so confused right now!\u201c\u2026 because it\u2019s a really simple story, Dear Anis\u201dKick, and Yuffi continues to be challenged as he stares at Lord Grants.\u201cYour father was afraid of Anis\u2019 influence. Because you acknowledge its value more than anyone else. So I set out to pull out my fangs thoroughly. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 my influence?\u201cIt\u2019s magic. Dear Anis, think calmly. What aristocracy do you associate with having a nobleman who supported your father?\u201cEr\u2026? Sorry, I can\u2019t answer that right away.\u201dThey say it\u2019s a layer of nobility that directs Lord Grants, but it doesn\u2019t come out painfully. I know it\u2019s your father\u2019s right arm, but when it comes to Lord Grants, I don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s doing\u2026? I guess I\u2019m just ignorant!\u201cSo, Caind, what about you?\u201c\u2026 Factions that support your father have a lot to do with armaments. We gather strong support from knights everywhere, including Kingsguards, regular investigators of important places of spiritual resources, and the nobles of the territory, including their important places.\u201d\u201cUm, I mean, when I say it, it means faction, right?\u201cYes\u2026. my mother used to say it. In times of war, he strongly hopes to convert magic to knighthood.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. so?\u201cOn the contrary, I ask, what do you think will happen if your father takes in Lady Anis?\u2026 Er, Lord Grants\u2019 faction is a faction aristocrat, right? He said there is strong support from nobles who protect the country\u2019s vital resource, the Spiritual Resource, or hold it in their territory.It\u2019s a delicious story even for me. Because they may have accommodated the resources in the realm, and most importantly, they can connect with the knights operating locally, so the propaganda of the magic props may have progressed quickly\u2026 right?\u201c\u2026 have you noticed\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? Is that what this is\u2026?\u201cMaster Anis\u2019 magic can also be used by civilians. I mean, it threatens to transform the way the Knights are. Master Anis was standing around trying not to have power, wasn\u2019t he? It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if there were others who thought the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you say that\u2019s Lord Grants?Unexpectedly turn your gaze to Lord Grants\u2026. Scary, I\u2019ve never thought I was so scared of people.It\u2019s just my father\u2019s right arm, and I thought he was someone who used to help my father. But you\u2019re not interested in me at all, so I thought you were being ignored. At the bottom of my belly, I was putting that idea around\u2026?\u201cGenerally, as Yuffi imagined.\u201d\u201cLies\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 so, but why is that a political enemy? What a little girl I was!\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of numbers.\u201d\u201c\u2026 number?\u201cIf you are serious about creating your own faction, the people may turn to the enemy. Because magic props do not choose the user. Both the inferior aristocrats who are being treated cold and the Adventurer Alliance may attach to you in search of profits from demonic props. You have too much power on your side. On top of that, I had a bad compromise with the central nobles that move this country.\u201dMy mouth gets sour. I think my stomach fluids are coming up\u2026. undeniable.\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t have the will to fight, you could have just broken the country. All you have to do is gently touch magic. All you have to do is distribute that invention. You were\u2026 the biggest political opponent that could destroy this country.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201cNot to mention that in your childhood you were inclined to magic. I was just stepping forward for that. The idea, the thought, the secret talent\u2026 I feared. Assuming you didn\u2019t leave the palace, I was forced to take Cain as my fianc\u00e9e and ask you to leave the royal family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026!?\u201dYou didn\u2019t think you were included in such thoughts, Caindo, and you\u2019re circling your eyes. What, scared\u2026\u2026! You didn\u2019t show that bare gesture at all, Lord Grants\u2026\u2026!\u201cIt is only through the use of those who would be enemies to politics, Princess Anisphere. It only deepens my remorse that it became the poison that passed around\u2026 but you didn\u2019t have any credibility when you were a child.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust you\u2026\u201d\u201cIts brilliance, the flexibility of thought that just keeps the throne away from itself. There are children who are not even adults yet. Uffi was treated like a prodigy, but that\u2019s only worth a thousand. The subordinate who obeys, without the people, the whole country will not be made up. In that respect, your own worth is immeasurable.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so poisoned that no one expected me to\u2026? Did you work that way around?\u201cI didn\u2019t root that aggressively. I got caught out of the palace early. But\u2026 I\u2019m more guilty than anyone of not taking your hand, even though I realize your worth.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the Sprout Knights chief who allowed the Kingsguards and Samurais to spread Mana Blade, was it? Was that you? Lord Grants.\u201d\u201cMatthew wanted it more aggressively. I\u2019m the one who stopped it. Speak to His Majesty, too. At least wait until Prince Algard is in power and turns to stone.\u201d\u2026 Yes, it was.I was unintentionally stunned and dropped. I know it\u2019s a shock, but it\u2019s not sad either. Only surprise recruited me, and my thoughts stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: 63\u201cSee, Caind?\u201dWhen I stopped thinking, Lord Grants called to Caindkun so.Caindo-kun also has a flashing face about whether he hasn\u2019t caught up with his thoughts. If Lord Grants speaks to me, I will hack and turn my gaze to Lord Grants. But I immediately bit my lips and leaned down.\u201cEven Princess Anisphere is not properly educated as a royalty, is she? He pulled back on the understanding that if he showed talent poorly, he could even overshadow Prince Algard\u2019s advantage. And I showed it to my surroundings by leaning towards a study called Magic. The royals behave in concealment of their talents.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I pursued the cause of my inability to use magic on my own, and even found the prospect of solving it myself. Spirituality and talent to do this from childhood. Furthermore, the invention of magical alternative technologies that can be used by civilians. Do you have any idea how unusual this is?I feel itchy when I get complimented again\u2026. but I pull myself off a bit when I get lined up again. I wonder if you were so afraid from the eyes around you, I want to tell myself to mind the eyes around you for a second. I can\u2019t tell you about Yufi, either, can I?Even though that was the purpose, it makes me think it worked better than I thought it would. I\u2019m going to have a bitter laugh at this.\u201cStill, Princess Anisphere can stand as king in the bend. Don\u2019t you find that talent horrible?\u2026\u2026\u201cIt is a particular point to say that Princess Anisphere does not have enough character as a royalty. But that is the royal standard in the Kingdom of Palettia standards. What if she was the head of another country, or a force that could rival another country? What if I\u2019ve been waging a battle to keep a palletian kingdom rich in spiritual resources in my hands? Even if civilians don\u2019t say so much about nobility, they come to exercise their magic, right?\u2026 Ugh, yeah. That does scare you, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve only made magic tools from the perspective of making it convenient for everyone, but I could make something more vicious if it were to be used entirely as force.The advantages of magic props are that they can be used by anyone and that mass production is possible as long as resources are available. And easy to handle. You just have to get used to it. If you spread it to the military, that\u2019s the only way you can get a bottom up.Miguel did say something similar. If you look at me as a virtual enemy, you know exactly how vicious I am. Lord Grants says he was putting me in danger, but it\u2019s his own business, and I\u2019m convinced.Even I know the dangers of magic\u2026. No, I guess I meant to understand. Perhaps it was more dangerous from around. I\u2019ve been paying attention to the dangers of technology, but I may not have thought enough about it until after it became popular.\u201cWell, then why is Princess Anisphere in such a low position?!?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s what Princess Anisphere wanted, and it was our plot. Princess Anisphere\u2019s invention is wonderful. But it can shake the very foundation of the kingdom. It took time to embrace Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic in our country, where she has developed her magical faith as the Lord. It\u2019s not enough to allow spills to other countries.\u201dAfter saying all that, Lord Grants tells him to sharpen his vicious eyeballs.\u201cAnd why? Why did you say that? Caind, that\u2019s why I pointed out that my eyes were cloudy. Flushed by rumors around me, I can\u2019t use magic, I don\u2019t have enough wielding as a royalty. That\u2019s all you unconsciously look at Princess Anisphere as an understatement. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t see the secret truth about Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cKu\u2026\u2026!\u201cBeing able to use magic is the symbol of aristocratic authority. This country has long flourished in its hearts with its values. Indeed Princess Anisphere is rightly heretical. But what the people want is not authority, it\u2019s merit. Don\u2019t get me wrong about that. The people find authority in their achievements because they build up their achievements. What the hell do you think you can beat Princess Anisphere right now?Caindo-kun has fallen prey to harsh reprimands. No, Lord Grants is unforgiving\u2026\u2026Lord Grants turned his gaze to me as I was feeling somewhat unhappy. And I thought I closed my eyes, and I bowed my head deeply. Yeah!? Hey!?\u201cGu, Lord Grants! Keep your head up!\u201cNo. This is my mess. I was afraid of you as a child, and your fangs jeopardized your journey to the country. It is undoubtedly true that I secretly turned my hand and helped to isolate you. And now, if this country wants you, it will give you back your hands. This iniquity must be right.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s only if you think of the country, right? I didn\u2019t want the country to be rough. I myself do not seek honor or status. So even if they say so\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dAs he awoke, Yufi called me in a low roaring voice. I trembled unexpectedly.Looking at the fearful Uffi, there was a Uffi staring at Lord Grants in his shapes until he was horrible and he was about to scream.\u201c\u2026 Master Anis can be angrier.\u201d\u201cOh, no, even if they say I\u2019m angry\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t care if you say that. No, I\u2019m really in trouble!? You\u2019re more angry with Yufi!? Why is Yufi angrier than I am!?Seeing how I was still in a hurry, Yufi exhaled deeply as she rubbed her brows loose. Hey, what\u2019s up?\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying you\u2019re too kind. Your father\u2026 this man is a good person for your disability, isn\u2019t he? I know it\u2019s for the country. Even if you understand, don\u2019t be so easily convinced. This man was clearly your enemy.\u201d\u201cAnd enemies are huge\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, Uffi is right. My loyalty was dedicated to His Majesty Orphanth. It was never dedicated to you. In that regard, it was difficult for you to deal with both your allies and your enemies. Therefore, it was honestly my intention to stroke my chest down that I was being held in a cage away from the palace. That\u2019s the man I thought he was. Never on your side.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what politics is, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s so angry\u2026? No, there\u2019s something I wanted too, and I\u2019m not so scared that I\u2019m going to get angry\u2026\u201dSo Lord Grants has been treating me seriously as a political opponent since I was a kid!? That fact scares me more and I\u2019m not talking about getting angry anymore! Stop it already! That\u2019s the total surrender of the white flag!?\u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason to argue with Lord Grants\u2026\u201d\u201cHappy for your disabling?\u201cSo he said he wasn\u2019t dissatisfied there. And that\u2019s what royalty is all about\u2026?\u201c\u2026 you surprise me at all. I have raised you from the bottom of my heart to admire your majesty and queen.\u201dYuffi has frowned at me looking unconvinced somewhere. Yes, that\u2019s fine. Because I\u2019m saying I\u2019m good. Don\u2019t be mad, you don\u2019t know what to do with me\u2026\u201c\u2026 what do you say, Caind\u201d\u201c\u2026 Father\u201d\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know unless I try to exchange words. It\u2019s not a good idea just to turn hostile because you\u2019re an enemy. You have to take a good look at them and get what you get. That\u2019s what we need in the political world.\u201dCaind-kun drops without help to Lord Grants\u2019 words. Ugh, uhh, I can\u2019t watch you for a second. Even though Magenta family communication is bad for my heart!\u201cBut now you don\u2019t have any more reason for Kaindo-kun to make a mistake with Yufi, do you? When I\u2019m adopted, I won\u2019t be your sister, but in the future, I just need to be active in relation to the king and his subordinates. If it was originally raised that way, it would fit in the sheath. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing\u2026\u201dSo you\u2019re not just depressed like that, are you? I\u2019m going to tell Caindo because I want to, but Caindo doesn\u2019t say anything just to look at me with a frigid eye.Ugh, and I don\u2019t know how to treat boys my age! What am I supposed to do?\u201c\u2026 I was looking down on you, wasn\u2019t I?\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. But don\u2019t you have a choice? It\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t use magic, isn\u2019t it?\u201cOn the contrary, I thought it was royal defilement\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s true that it was actually disgraceful\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were acting like you knew that, right? I was manipulating my impressions by putting all sorts of ideas around it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well, yeah. Yeah, but.\u201dWhen I answered, Kaindo-kun shook his head left and right without force. And take a deep sigh and hold your head.\u201c\u2026 you especially pointed out that you only saw the upper side, Father. I\u2019m sorry for being such an impudent son.\u201d\u201cUhm. The time left is short, but learn and refine. Times will change dramatically from now on. Encourage them not to be left behind by the changes of their time. Or I\u2019ll just be ashamed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll carve it on my chest\u201dKaindo-kun nodded to Lord Grants with a strange look on his face, then turned his gaze to me again and bowed his head.\u201cI am ashamed of our unknown. I\u2019m sorry, Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ok. I\u2019ll take that apology. If you feel ashamed, I want you to do your best as successor to the Duke\u2019s family in the future. That\u2019s all I want from you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dCaindo-kun squeals so that he doesn\u2019t lift his head and bites it off. I can bow my head from unexpected people today, it\u2019s somehow complicated.I don\u2019t want you to apologize for anything. I didn\u2019t want to spread magic. If you could use it to bring the country together, it would have been worth it for me to be there.Okay, let\u2019s settle this one down.Pan, I slapped my hand and Mrs. Nerschel told me to get some air in.\u201cThis is what happened today, and let\u2019s get some rest. Princess Anisphere has just returned from her journey.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern. So, which room should I rest in\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Can I have Yuffi\u2019s room, please?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cRight?\u201dRight? It\u2019s not! I tried to protest unintentionally and Yufi pressured me to shut me up. Ugh\u2026! The Duke of Magenta house scared Yikes\u2026\u2026!After being told to disperse, I was captured by Uffi and taken to Uffi\u2019s room. For some reason, I felt like Donna. They\u2019re going to sell it\u2026How did this happen!After I was taken to Yuffi\u2019s room, I kept being pillowed by Yuffi. After the maids quickly finished dressing me, I was thrown into bed by Ufi to this day.Yufi is holding me tight and burying my face without saying anything. I can\u2019t see the look on my face because of it. I was scattering an aura that I could see was just obviously grumpy, and I got in trouble.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Yuffi expose his grievances so far. I stroke my head wondering if this is also the effect of spiritualization.\u201c\u2026 Why isn\u2019t Anis angry?\u201d\u201cTalk about that again?I finally laughed bitterly at the words Yufi shrugged. Yuffi\u2019s dissatisfaction seems to be with what Lord Grants did to me. To be more precise, I suppose you\u2019re angry that I didn\u2019t say anything dissatisfied when it was revealed.But you can\u2019t remember how angry Lord Grants said you were. I know you\u2019re scared. Because Lord Grants\u2019 purpose and mine are not competing. There\u2019s no place for Lord Grants to think of just chills in the fact that they were just rolling over his palms.\u201c\u2026 you would have been angry if I had been in Anis\u2019s shoes, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u2026 that may not be denied. But you can\u2019t be mad at something you can\u2019t be mad at, so I want you to give me a break.\u201c\u2026 I know. I know you\u2019re like that. But I\u2019m anxious. That\u2019s how you keep giving in and worrying.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I wonder. So if we\u2019re all happy and we don\u2019t have to contend, is it sweet to think I\u2019m happy too?\u201cSweet.\u201d\u201cYou just cut it off!?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, if you\u2019re not happy, you can\u2019t.\u201dYufi\u2019s hand holds my hand. My heart bounces hard on my hand held to tangle my fingers.Uffi\u2019s face, finally raised, was full of worry. He looks at me like he\u2019s anxiously shaking his eyes and complaining.\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re happy, too? You are likely to cut off even your happiness and give it to others\u2026 I know that is your virtue. But I saw your father today and changed my mind. Some people take advantage of it.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you have a choice, do you? I rather admire how well you used it, because that\u2019s what my father would have done\u2026\u201d\u201cThat led to your tears today, didn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 eh\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t delude me\u201dYes, I\u2019m sorry. I was as unhappy as I thought. I was aware of what I had invited myself, but if I said it wasn\u2019t hard, it was a lie!So spare me the strength of the arms you hold tight, Yufi! Squeeze! Because I squeeze! Out! Out! There\u2019s something out there you shouldn\u2019t!\u201cKyu, suddenly it\u2019s not that easy to change!\u201cAren\u2019t you even going to change\u2026?\u201cNo, even I want to be happy with the crowd\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of happiness is that people-like? Is that really a wish you want to fulfill from the bottom of your heart?Asked by Uffi, I think and see about my own happiness.The happiness I want. Thinking about it, the answer was too simple.\u201cIt\u2019s already happening. There\u2019s someone who\u2019ll admit it, and I can use magic. There is someone who could have been saved by my magic. I could protect my smile. Even the country will be better, helping to create a new era. I\u2019m so happy that I\u2019m too happy.\u201dSo I\u2019m not dissatisfied, and Yuffi\u2019s body leaves when she tries to tell me that she\u2019s holding me tight. Then Yuffi gets horseback ridden by me, and my hands are held against Yuffi\u2019s bed. Yufi\u2019s eyes, dressed to look down, were set.What, why are you looking so dissatisfied, Yufi\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s good if you say so. So this is my own selfish self.\u201d\u201cWhat, that\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to drown. As much as I\u2019d like to say I don\u2019t want to let go. I\u2019ll also push you for happiness you don\u2019t want\u2026\u2026 are you ready?Uffi whispers with a sneering grin. There\u2019s a chill running down my spine, but I can\u2019t escape with my hands held down. I accidentally laugh at love.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I want to be happy, too. It\u2019s not like you want to be unhappy, is it? But my happiness is that everyone is smiling. Even if I\u2019m a little bitter or unhappy for that reason, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t care anymore.But if they say I can\u2019t be happy. If you say you make me happy like this.\u201cI\u2019m ready\u2026 will you not let me go?I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing more I can do. I\u2019m drowning in you.If I\u2019m going to hold my breath, I want to die drowning happily ever after. You could have just been killed by Ufi.I don\u2019t talk about it. But that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for and forgiving. I just wish in my heart, so please forgive me.I must be laughing from the bottom of my heart right now. So happy. I\u2019m already happy, Uffi.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201dThen Yufi frowned. I wonder if my heart has been distracted.\u201c\u2026 if you\u2019re too defenseless, you\u2019ll really squash all the way to the bone marrow.\u201d\u201cHih.\u201dPredator, I want you to stop grinning because it\u2019s really bad for your heart! My heart is hitting the early bell like an idiot. No, no, I\u2019m not happy to be cornered! Oh, no!But I can\u2019t run, and I don\u2019t want to. Oh, I knew I was drowning\u2026. Oh, I don\u2019t know anymore!\u201cHey, let\u2019s go to sleep! Yufi! Look, I\u2019m tired! Hey!\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201dI don\u2019t think I can escape the demon\u2019s hand in pursuit! Let\u2019s keep Yufi asleep, that way you can rest assured! Get your hands off me, Yufi, and I\u2019ll be the pillow again. Pompous slap on Yufi\u2019s back like that.I mean it with pleasure. I\u2019m really happy to be told, but I may not be happy well. So I hope you\u2019ll let me lean over a little.The first day of my stay at the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house ended. Speaking of which, how long will you be staying? But I\u2019m ready to adopt Yufi, and until then, can I rest over here? But Raini back in the outhouse, Ilia, who got me to leave a message, is also concerned.Shall I give both of you a rest? We can rest ourselves. I\u2019ll write down a note in my heart saying I\u2019ll talk to Lord Grants and Mrs. Nerschel later.Well, the house of the Duke of Magenta is a big splendid mansion. Plus, it makes history feel like it, so I don\u2019t get tired of just looking around.Right now, I can behave differently from Uffi. Because Mrs Nerschel has called me. Lord Grants has official business, and then he left me behind. I don\u2019t have much time.I decided to take a walk on the grounds of the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house because it was a good idea to see the mansion freely. So I was touring the premises.\u201c\u2026 ah\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dI ran into Caindo. Kaindo-kun, who clearly had no hegemony, was in the corner of the premises as one thought. It\u2019s a little awkward.But I can\u2019t ignore anything more than what I found.\u201cEr\u2026 how are you?\u201c\u2026 well, Princess Anisphere doesn\u2019t care.\u201dKaindo-kun, who shakes his neck left and right without force, seems to have completely disappeared in disobedience to me. Instead, it\u2019s scary, trying to keep me away with that attitude.\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like that, but it overlaps. With Al. It reminds me of when Al broke up with me. Kaindo-kun now looks just like Al then.I wonder what I was right to do then. I also pushed Al-Kun away from me trying to stay away. I thought that was for Al. But Al has stepped off the road.I really wanted to walk down the road with you. Yet Al-Kun has already gone out of reach. If you think so, you can\u2019t ignore Kaindo-kun, and you\u2019re driven by an impulse that resembles a sense of impatience.\u201cIt\u2019s not okay!\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think of Caind-kun right now. So talk to me. Sometimes you can\u2019t talk when you have eyes around you, can you?Kaindo-kun looks at me with his eyes round. But soon, I look away from him at first sight.\u201cDon\u2019t turn away. Lord Magenta told you yesterday, didn\u2019t he? He said he had something to gain even if his opponent was an enemy. I\u2019m not your enemy, and I just want to talk to you because you\u2019re depressed\u2026 it\u2019s not refreshing to watch.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t like talking to you because I can poke my misery.\u201dCaindo-kun returns it with a pointy voice\u2026. Yeah, that\u2019s about all I need.\u201cIs that my fault? Maybe it\u2019s bad. I\u2019m the one who misled you. I was acting like I was misleading you. If you say so, you can\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201cIf so\u2026 leave me alone\u201d\u201cI threw my brother away with it.\u201dCaindo-kun\u2019s gaze can be directed at me again. Eyes open to surprise look closely at me.\u2026 don\u2019t even think about it for Al then. If I had my feelings in my mouth, I wonder if something had changed.\u201cI regret it. I regret it enough to regret it from the bottom of my heart for the rest of my life. Kaindo-kun looks just like Al right now. Some attitude like you\u2019re miserable and you think you\u2019re being looked down on from around you. I can\u2019t get my chest up, I can\u2019t admit I\u2019m rotten.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so what do you say\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it you who wants to talk? But when I think of it alone, it often doesn\u2019t look unexpected. Is it annoying that I want to talk to you?\u201c\u2026 annoying though\u201d\u201cOh well. Then I don\u2019t know, your annoyance. [M] I couldn\u2019t hide your feelings at the moment they realized.\u201dShoulder to shoulder. It\u2019s not something I could have said, either, but if I can\u2019t solve what I hold on to on my own, I end up annoying someone.I don\u2019t want to rely, I know how it feels. But I have to rely on it. That doesn\u2019t have to be me. But I don\u2019t think Caindo-kun is right to be alone now.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be me. You should talk to someone who listens to you properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not Prince Algard\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You are not Al. [M]\u2026 so we can start over. Unlike Al.\u201dIf you won\u2019t open your heart to me, I can\u2019t help it. It makes no sense if you take care of yourself. I guess this is the limit.Return your heels and try to leave this place. That\u2019s what I heard on my back, Caindo-kun\u2019s little voice.\u201c\u2026 to me Prince Algard is a traitor\u201dUnexpectedly, stop the leg.\u201cI am an unforgiving traitor who scorned my sister while being royal. I didn\u2019t understand. So you surrounded your sister, and you thought you had something in mind and you had your sister at hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well\u201d\u201c\u2026 but I may have become a traitor too. You must have been really competent and on my sister\u2019s side. I couldn\u2019t believe it and exposed myself to indifference without finding out the truth\u2026 what difference does it make to Prince Algard?\u201d\u201cI do. There\u2019s plenty of them.\u201dKeep your back on Kaindo-kun, I spin the words.\u201cAl is not as sweet as you. I couldn\u2019t be sweet. Al is a traitor. But I made all my own decisions and I betrayed you. Expectations, roles, all of them. I don\u2019t care how bad Al is prepared to be like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you think I\u2019m sweet?\u201cYou should have believed Uffi, right? Al Kun had nothing to believe. myself, and around me. I\u2019m the one who pushed him that way. So Al Kun doesn\u2019t rely on anyone, he can\u2019t even make weak noises. That\u2019s what I became.\u201dYour father, your mother, even the ministers around you didn\u2019t believe you. I couldn\u2019t believe anything, I was just a king who was given a role and asked to do just that.Because Al didn\u2019t have any talent. Maybe that\u2019s why it was the concern of my fathers who thought I wouldn\u2019t let them shoulder the blame that just passed\u2026. but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how much the despair would hurt if I realized that.\u201cSo don\u2019t wave away. Don\u2019t close your heart. You can rely on someone because you\u2019re miserable. If the pride of nobility disturbs you, you can throw that away\u2026. because you still have magic.\u201dI didn\u2019t have it, because you can use the magic that I envy from the bottom of my heart. However, that fact alone gives this country a number of chances.\u201cI\u2019m on your side. Even Lord Grants is tough, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll wait. Mrs. Nerschel is also as talented a woman as she was studying magic. You should be able to ask your opinion. If you look up, see. Your future isn\u2019t so bright!Spread your hands and look back. Please pass it on, with that in mind.Kaindo-kun was looking at me. Just hold still on to me without saying anything.I had no more words to throw, either. We were gazing at each other, but Kaindo-kun quietly lowers his head.Deep down, without saying anything. And he walked away from the spot\u2026. There were no more words to throw on its back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: 64A stay at the Duke of Magenta\u2019s house marks the end of the day. Although it will still take Yuffi some time to officially announce that he will be adopted, we must also go back and prepare ourselves for that.In fact, this will be the last day Yuffi will visit the House of the Duke of Magenta as his \u201cdaughter\u201d. Raini was in the carriage to pick me up, and he greeted me with a smile.With me and Raini watching like that, I was facing my family like Uffi would spare a breakup. Lord Grants has his usual faceless expression and Mrs. Nerschel remains with a gentle smile.And Kaind-kun. After all, I never exchanged words. His expression is as quiet as it sounds.\u201c\u2026 there are only a few things that can be done in a relationship between parents and children. Encourage me, Uffi.\u201d\u201cYes. How is your father? I\u2019ll run right up to you and show you.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dThe goodbye between Yufi and Lord Grants was light by the time it was clear. Not as a father and daughter, but as the next queen and duke, I\u2019m going to face it from now on.It\u2019s a new relationship for the two of us, maybe it\u2019s something desirable. A smile floating around each other seemed to tell the story of it.\u201c\u2026 Ufi\u201d\u201cMother.\u201dMrs. Nerschel, who entered quietly, hugs Yufi. on his forehead, and kiss his cheek to gently release Uffi.There were no words, and I know that the two of them exchanged words more than once during their stay alone. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s after we\u2019ve spoken to each other so much that we don\u2019t need words anymore.And\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 Caind\u201dYufi turns back to Kaindo-kun. Kaindo-kun also returns his gaze to Ufi in a calm manner.We have nothing to say to each other, we remain faceless. I could hear Raini swallowing spit watching such a tense scene. I hold my fist naturally, too.\u201c\u2026 Sister, I will succeed my father\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cNot right away. I don\u2019t know when. Still, one day I\u2019ll stick my chest out and tell him. So\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s all Caindo-kun said. He strained his chest. The drawn-knot lips are slightly trembling and the gaze is caught staring at them because they are desperately indulging in falling. Words that were unnaturally interrupted did not go on, but still stared at Yufi.Yufi breaks his expression after taking Caindo-kun\u2019s word for it. I smile and gently stroke Caindo-kun\u2019s cheek.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, sister\u201dAway from Kaindo-kun, who has leaned down, Yufi turns her back and walks toward us. I could see Mrs. Nerschel bowing her head in support of Kaindo-kun on that back.The Duke of Magenta is just staring at Uffi\u2019s back as he walks in grandeur.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Lady Anis, Raini\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s go\u201dWe boarded the carriage and headed out of the palace.Through the window, three of the Duke of Magenta\u2019s family were seen dropping off until our carriage was out of sight.Uffi never looked back.That day, the Kingdom of Palletia takes a turning point.This is what is told in later history. He said it was the day when the old days came to an end and the dawn of a new era.During the royal sight of the castle. There were gathered the nobles in charge of the politics of the Kingdom of Palletia.Needless to say, there are also figures of the Duke of Magenta, the right-hand man of His Majesty, and the directors of the Ministry of Magic. Today, an important announcement from Orphans says he will disclose the information only to the Heavy Towns in view of its contents and decide on future policies.There are many nobles who look nervous, but it is the executive officers who serve in the Ministry of Magic who are not pale among them. Because they were waiting for the day as if they didn\u2019t care.There is one agenda they predict. That was associated with rumors that Princess Anisphere, who was investigating the Spirit Contract with her royal life, had fulfilled her visit with the Spirit Contractor. I was wondering if it was a report on the findings of the Spirit Contract.In fact, since then, Anisphere has not made any significant moves while remaining stuck in the outhouse. For a Magic Ministry executive whose relationship with Anisphere is less fragrant than her former one, her movements are hard to keep an eye on.With each thought, His Majesty Orphanth is informed of his admission. Next to it is Queen Silphine, and the Princess Anisphere and the Duke of Uphilia are the ones who walk about one step back.It was also a natural sight to have Uphilia next to the earliest anisphere. Orphanth and Silphine sit on the throne, taking their position so that Anisphere and Uphilia refrain from doing so between their seats.\u201cMy lords, you\u2019ve gathered well. Take it easy first. I have an important announcement to make today. Sooner or later it will be published to the whole country, but think of it as a publication for the previous phase.\u201dWith so many people breathing in tension, Orphans moves his gaze to see the faces on the spot before continuing.\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s new to my ears that Yu ordered Anisphere to unravel the Spirit Covenant as a royal fate the other day. I just wanted to let you know that I\u2019ve set up a place like this because of the results of that investigation.\u201dAgain, and the whining leaks. Orphans restores silence by silencing the place where he was born.\u201cAsk Anisphere and her assistant, Uphilia, for more information\u2026 there are some things I need to tell you before I do. I really want you to listen. During this investigation of the Spirit Contract, Uphilia fulfilled the Spirit Contract\u201dA twist spreads to the words of Orphans, where the gaze of the field gathers to Uphilia, where it refrains next to Orphans.Spirit contractors have important meaning in this country. It was therefore a surprise. That talented woman and the famous Miss Uphilia. This was undoubtedly good news. Uphilia, with her gaze gathered, shows herself in awe.\u201cBe quiet! \u2026 In this survey, great progress could be made in clarifying the Spirit Contract. The work of Annisphere, Uphilia, who accomplished this feat, is immense. So the rest of you have to get this report and tell everyone that you\u2019ve made a big decision.\u201dEveryone gets quiet as if to listen to Orphans. The gaze that was gathering to Uphilia returns to Orphans again.I made sure my gaze returned to me, and Orphans coughed once before continuing.\u201cThe details of the Spirit Contract will be explained later by Anisphere and Uphilia, who were involved in the investigation. To conclude earlier, Anisphere was not granted a spiritual covenant. There are numerous who question the qualities of the king of Anisphere more than before, and it can be said that the investigation of this spiritual covenant was also a test to question Anisphere\u2019s qualities as royalty\u2026 but the results were not fragrant\u201dAnisphere lays her eyes down to match Orphans\u2019 words. However, it does not show a faint appearance, but only sits quietly.\u201cBut it is only with the results of the Anispheric investigation that we are very pleased to be welcomed into the country by a new spiritual contractor named Uphilia. Therefore, the rest was to let Uphilia take the reward\u2026. Uphilia, forward!Orphans calls me, and Uphilia goes forward to offer a respectful thank you.One nod, then Orphans sends his gaze to look over the nobles, then tells them softly.\u201cThe rest would like to greatly appreciate this achievement and tell everyone that we welcome Uphilia as our adopted son.\u201dshock. Exactly to show the face-to-face reaction of this occasion, that word would suit.Welcome to the royal family for adoption. There was no one here who could not imagine what that meant.\u201cOh no\u2026 Your Majesty, give Miss Uphilia the right to inherit the throne!?\u201d\u201cWhatever. Uphilia has also been educated as the next queen by the former. And in this one case, I showed him the qualities. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s too much to welcome you to the royal family. Does anyone have a problem with that?\u201cI don\u2019t disagree, but I\u2019d like you to forgive me for a word. Sire.\u201dIt was Grants who advanced. Grants stares straight at Orphans as he gathers the gaze of the nobles all together while the twist does not subside.\u201cGrants. Good, tell me.\u201d\u201cI am honored to have a high regard for the achievements of Uphilia in this case. But as it is, some will have some concerns about our relationship with the royal family. So let me declare it again. I hereby declare that Uphilia and I are disconnected from the family. than this, the princess and the duke, let me relate in that position.\u201dGrants\u2019 declaration once again leads to a widening outcome. That said, if Uphilia is welcomed as an adopted son by the royal family, her relationship with the Duke of Magenta will cease. And I made it clear that I was only going to treat you as someone else.It had no intention of subjecting the royal family to the Duke of Magenta, nor had it declared that the Duke of Magenta would be involved in the royal power.\u201cI praise you for guiding and raising me so far. \u2026 His Excellency the Duke of Magenta\u201dNot calling him Father, Uphilia called Grants Duke. No colour of agitation was seen there, and this could be seen as an agreement being reached between the royal family and the Duke of Magenta.The nobles realize that twitching and incredible events are real. And it gradually accelerated expectations of Uphilia. The advent of a new heir to the throne that embodied the feat of the first king even seemed like an act of legend.\u201cIt\u2019s Grants. My daughter is a treasure of my country. I want that loyalty to remain the same for the rest of my life and for this country.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s Uphilia. Give your name a new name. In the future, I will name myself Uphilia Fez Palettia. As a member of the royal family, I expect to bring prosperity to this country.\u201d\u201cYes, I swear I will not be ashamed of the honor I have bestowed upon myself\u2026. Father-in-law.\u201dAnd Uphilia, given a new name, stretcheth her breasts, and receiveth the name.The sound of applause begins to emerge, and it spreads one after the other and grows louder.Anisphere walks over beside Uphilia as the applause of blessings echoes.\u201cCongratulations, Uffi\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Master Anis\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need any more dating, do you?\u201c\u2026 Yes, Anis\u201dUffi smiled like a broken smile, and the two new sisters joined hands.Phew, I\u2019m nervous. I knew my shoulders would get too tight to shake a princess in an official setting.Well, the venue is excited to announce the adoption of Uphilia as well. Especially since the Magic Ministry executives feel welcome from the bottom of their minds. I want to ask him if he didn\u2019t like me being king when I couldn\u2019t use that much magic. No, I guess I didn\u2019t like it.But if I told you about the spiritual contract, you wouldn\u2019t have had this pleasure, would you? That made me feel a little pathetic. Still, it\u2019s my job to make the announcement.\u201cThen it\u2019s anise. Report on the findings of the Spirit Contract.\u201d\u201cYes, Father\u201dWow, I\u2019m here. Deep breaths, deep breaths. I need to be careful here if I think about the noise that\u2019s going to happen.I can see the color of sympathy in the gaze that can be directed at me as I advance again. Well, that\u2019s right. If Yufi were given the right to inherit the throne, I would be king. The buds would be crushed. But you\u2019re all hail because you don\u2019t want to be king!\u201cLet me now report my findings about the Spirit Contract. This time, the investigation of the Spirit Contract was carried out in anticipation of a clarification from the point of view of magic. As a result, we learned a number of facts.\u201dThen I explained the identity of the Great Spirit who contracts with the Spirit Contractor. And pale talk about its relationship and how it happened, etc. A man has a spirit in his soul. Exercise magic by working on the spirits around you by the resonance of their inner souls.A spiritual covenant is a feat accomplished by exchanging and spiritualizing the souls of the inner spirits with those of men, which can be called half bodies.\u201cThis is the truth of the Spirit covenant.\u201dSo I watched the nobles react. \u2026 silent, stunned, stunned. That\u2019s just the right reaction.Until earlier, there was no festivities when Uffi was granted the right to inherit the throne. The air just spreads like confusion.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cSo\u2026 Miss Uphilia\u2026 no, does that mean Princess Uphilia has become a spirit?\u201cIt uses man\u2019s flesh as a vessel, but his soul has already been replaced with the Spirit. It is Uffi\u2019s rare talent that has little effect on spiritualization, but it is still inevitable that the changes started to affect personality. Therefore, let me complain that it is dangerous for me to want a spiritual contract cheaply. Again, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to tell you about the danger\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you really say that is the truth!? Isn\u2019t a spiritual covenant a sacred act of covenant with the Spirit!?\u201d\u201cWhen I say sacred, I do not deny that it is sacred. Because you are reborn into the Great Spirit, which is close to God at all costs. So I let you set up these places through your father. Don\u2019t want a spiritual covenant cheaply, to give you that warning.\u201d\u201cThe Great Spirit is the end of the habit of spiritual contractors losing their flesh\u2026 you say it\u2019s also true? Okay, then! Are you saying that the Great Spirit was originally a person!?\u201d\u201cThis is what we got testimony from our nation\u2019s spiritual contractors. It\u2019s very credible, and most importantly, it includes the facts that Uffi felt, so let me tell you that it\u2019s not a lie.\u201dThe nobleman, who was asking roughly, became silent as if he had subsided. Everyone looks at each other and peeks at each other\u2019s complexions.\u201c\u2026 many will wonder why, knowing this fact, they welcomed Uphilia to the royal family. But this was also Uphilia\u2019s strong hope.\u201dSpeak up so your father can get the attention of the place. Uffi moves forward to take his place.\u201cEverything Annis says is true. I embodied it. Let me testify. That\u2019s why I was driven by the desire to use this as an opportunity to change this country. This country has long walked with the Spirit as a friend. I have appreciated its existence and have inherited with pride the benefits it bestows. But I began to think I would have to change my mind with the knowledge of Ennis\u2019 magic.Spirit covenant, it is indeed a feat that built this country. But this turns people into spirits. There is no doubt that the Spirit is a great being who receives and fulfils our prayers. But that\u2019s the devotion that someone who received people\u2019s prayers and wishes became the receptacle for their wishes. Someone has to be prepared. Even if you abandon being a person. That would be another way of being in one country. But\u2026 \u201cYufi stands next to me. And take my hand and show it in a connection.\u201cAnis has shown us another way. Do not abandon being a person, know how the Spirit is, and shape it as a human skill. Let\u2019s just say that\u2019s what magic has achieved. You can\u2019t want as much power as a spiritual covenant. But not too much can be done to benefit all of the people. Don\u2019t rely on the Spirit, people stay people, live like people. I\u2019d like to ask you again if that\u2019s the way the country is.\u201dIt is no mistake to profess the Spirit and develop the country with the benefit of magic given by the Spirit. But don\u2019t forget the fact that the closer you get to the Spirit, the farther you get from being a person.Magic can use the resources created by the Spirit to spread them among nobles and civilians alike. And you can walk like a person, Yuffi says. But let\u2019s not forget that it can deny the values and history we have cultivated.\u201cWhich country is right? I think each of those answers is different. But I want to say it out loud. Neither the path of worshipping the Spirit nor the path of cultivating magic is ever in conflict. I think we can take each other\u2019s hands, take each other\u2019s good spots, and walk into the future.\u201dPull the hand that Ufi was connecting to and turn to my hips. My heart bounces at a distance that approached me at once. Hey, hey! You didn\u2019t tell me this was a meeting!?When I turned my gaze on the protest to Uffi, I looked at him like he had succeeded in a prank, then I could see Uffi squeezing his expression and turning his gaze back to the nobles.\u201cFew people in this country can measure the value of anise correctly right now. Therefore, I want to inherit a great history. I want to get my hands on the new winds that are about to be born in this country right now. I believe that\u2019s the future that will make this country thrive.\u201dUffi declared that the nobles present here would be challenged.The truth of the spiritual covenant was elaborated, and Yufi, who became the spiritual covenant, affirmed his magic. This fact is significant.Magic is not repellent to the Spirit. Instead, it was declared that we could move forward hand in hand. The shock seemed to have been taken by everyone because they knew the truth and didn\u2019t take a pull.\u201cAnd that the Spirit has the magic he prefers, as Annis put it. That is what makes the Spirit aptitude. Ladies and gentlemen, will you remember this story? Naturally, I have the magic of that preference, too, that I have spiritualized. I can stretch my chest to say that the holder of that magic deserves to be called the turn of my soul. The one with that magic, Anisphere Wynn Palettia, is the only one in the world I can admit to.\u201dIt was with such a beautiful grin that Yufi proclaimed as she held me with one hand.I tried my best not to break my expression! The act, later called the \u201cde facto declaration of marriage,\u201d came to an end.After that, it was already a lot of noise. Whatever it is, it\u2019s not certain that Uffi will still be king. For once, I\u2019m the number one successor.Now that we know the truth about the Spirit Contractor, should we really welcome the Spirit Contractor to the throne? If a person lived like a person, it began to come out with a few voices saying that maybe that\u2019s what should make me king.There are certainly voices that say that it is because it is a tradition that we have inherited. It\u2019s hard to change the traditions and beliefs you\u2019ve inherited. However, there is no indication that some deny that you will conveniently interpret the fact.It was Father\u2019s voice that summed up the place to dispute.\u201cI know exactly what everyone thinks. The rest of it bothered my head, this is not a rush to conclusions. Therefore, a period shall be set aside. In the meantime, Anisphere and Uphilia should think of ways to guide the country in their own way! As a result, ask the nation which one to say as king! Anyone who disagrees, move on!No one moves forward to Father\u2019s proclamation. Nobody moves forward with this air on boulders\u2026\u2026If that\u2019s what you think, there\u2019s someone going in and out in front of us, and we circled our eyes. It was Lord Grants who moved forward.\u201cGrants?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything different. I also believe that we should follow His Majesty\u2019s heart as he pleases. However, I consider Princess Anisphere unfavourable under the present conditions even when comparing the measures of each other. Anyway, there is still no basement in this country that accepts Princess Anisphere\u2019s innovative ideas. Therefore, I would like to advance, and I would like permission for Princess Anisphere to wave that extraction under me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat!? What do you mean, Lord Grants!?\u201cThere have always been many voices in the Knights who wanted Princess Anisphere\u2019s inventions to be deployed. I would like to advance that it is the Knights who defend our country that Princess Anisphere\u2019s inventions are the easiest to feel the benefits and can remain a feat. Therefore, I think it would be a better choice for Princess Anisphere to wield an extraction under me because of the propaganda of the magic props. There are a lot of civilians in the Knights.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Duke of Magenta, who you are\u2026\u201dFor a moment, Yuffi\u2019s lips seemed to be drawn. There seemed to be a mix of resentment in the voices that came out of my mouth.\u2026 Is that it? This, Lord Grants, is totally coming to take me in, isn\u2019t it?!? Aah!?\u201cWhat do you say, Princess Anisphere?\u201cOh, no. Well, I\u2019m very honored\u2026\u201d\u201cOr did Princess Anisphere have any other handouts to spread magic?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 None. You know how thin the aristocratic connection is to me!? Lord Grants!? No, that\u2019s why I know it\u2019s a help ship!?\u201cPrincess Uphilia has accomplished her spiritual covenant, and she has excellent talent in magic. If so, shouldn\u2019t you wave that arm in the Ministry of Magic? If your specialty is different, each will have a different place to be active. I\u2019m foolish that the Ministry of Magic has to rethink its policy after learning the truth about the Spirit Contract, too?\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I wonder if that\u2019s the historic job of the Ministry of Magic to prepare the ground for Princess Uphilia to be active?Lord Grants asks the Magic Ministry\u2019s executive officer. The Ministry of Magic is also in trouble, because all of a sudden the truth about the spiritual covenant was revealed when he said that he was still in the process of restructuring.Or what? Could it be Lord Grants, you\u2019re sending Yuffi to the Ministry of Magic, right? I don\u2019t care what you think of this, do I?!? You\u2019re trying to surround me with your own faction on top of that!? You\u2019re lying!?\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s why you say you\u2019ll be in the back shield of the anisphere? It\u2019s Grants.\u201d\u201cYes, I am proud to say that I am not the only one in this country who can create an environment in which Princess Anisphere\u2019s worth can be correctly harnessed\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. Shaking each other\u2019s power in a better way is especially important. Grants would be best suited to oversee the plan we\u2019ve been hearing from Anisphere for a long time.\u201d\u201cThe development of traffic through flying demonic props, the spread of demonic props to the Knights, and even the unveiling of demonic props that help people everywhere to live. Grants, who oversees the Knights\u2019 extraction as its director, deserves it\u2026\u201dMy mother, who has been silent until now, whines with her fingers on her temples. Until Father, his eyes are turned away like a reality escape. I think it makes sense\u2026Here, and look at Uffi lying next to him. Its eyes are colored by a burning passion, looking to Lord Grants. The lips that portray the shape of a grin are occasionally drawn as if they recall.As Lord Grants declared, as someone else in red with Uffi, I think he intends to behave only in the position of princess and duke.So I have no hesitation in drawing me into my own camp. Even worse was the flow that created to send Yuffi to the Ministry of Magic. Seems like the best hand to me, too, but too unforgiving.\u201cNothing was meant to keep you two apart. For a while, we\u2019ll be waving each other\u2019s own extraction at the Royal Castle. It would seem problematic for the two of us to live in the outhouse as it is. I think Princess Anisphere may be asked to leave the castle and wave the extraction\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I think it\u2019s a great idea. Lord Grants.\u201dSo remember. Yufi squeaks as she gives out an aura that is likely to hear such a sub audio.In the end, I have no reason to disagree, nor can the nobles around me give any reason to disagree, even if they cannot say yes. Lord Grants was entrusted with the role of my supervisor, and I decided to work under Lord Grants to disseminate the invention of magic.\u2026 How did this happen!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: 65\u201c\u2026 to the point of becoming. Is that why Master Uphilia is insistent?\u201dWe were returning to the outhouse after the report on the findings of the Spirit Contract and the meeting that set the general policy for the future.At the end of Ilia\u2019s gaze is Yufi, who is silent with a faceless expression like Nobu\u2019s. It is the expression that seeps out the bad mood of the thing. Raini is watching Yufi as if she were surprised, and she\u2019s kind of cute and laughs like a little animal.\u201cI think it makes sense. I can\u2019t believe Lord Grants hit that daring hand over there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I set up anise. I handled the situation the way I wanted while silencing the Ministry of Magic in anticipation that if I denounced Annis in its name, I would buy my unhappiness. They did it\u2026\u201dLord Grants has successfully exploited the differences between the layers who support me and Uffi. Yufi has a thick faith in the traditional Spirit and remembers well by the nobles who have power and move the backbone of politics. By contrast, I gathered support from the Knights and other people who actually worked in the field.It would not be strange for me and Uffi to be in conflict if it were meant to be. But Yufi can be described as a pro-technical school. Nor have I refused to even have a wind that weighs magic just because I don\u2019t care about excessive faith.In other words, those who support us more than ourselves if we were to make a scene. And until now, factions, including the Ministry of Magic, had power. Originally, it was not strange to be enlivened by the advent of Uffi, with enough qualities to be too much as its flaghead.But if I open the lid, Uffi will admit to magic and insist that it should be incorporated into the country, and I, the banner of the opposing forces, will also fall under the protection of Lord Grants, who is deeply rooted as a faction.Until now, I have not been active in such a way that I have no power over myself, but it may be more than a national undertaking that has been officially recognised by the State. I mean, I have no reason to lose my hand either.Once magic spreads, I am confident that I will spread my invention once and for all, starting with the Knights who thirst for it. Who lost money, it is a force that sought to strengthen the tide of spiritual faith with Ufi in charge. The diagram completely frustrated my nose.What\u2019s terrible here is that Lord Grants used Ufi to throw round to frustrate his nose. It\u2019s like sending Yufi in as an assassin to frustrate the nose of his opponents, making it clear that he can\u2019t get into his own camp. It\u2019s really lame\u2026\u2026\u201cI know it\u2019s necessary\u2026\u2026. but i didn\u2019t think i could take up anise. I was going to persuade the Ministry of Magic for two, but I can\u2019t beat that guy by putting in place a situation that would advance the spread of magic\u2026\u201dUffi groans as he bites his teeth in remorse. I think it\u2019s probably an illusion to hear something like that.\u201cSo does Master Anis work under Lord Grants tomorrow?\u201cYou will, and Yuffi will go to the Ministry of Magic. It will be a little while before it is made public to the people, but we will be disclosing it among the nobles. From now on, it\u2019ll be a prep period to figure out which one will be king.\u201d\u201cBut the situation is a bad flag color for Master Uphilia\u201d\u201cAnis stands as his back shield, and he\u2019s more welcome than his ex. I may be held hostage at first, but as far as magic is concerned, it will be difficult to agree.\u201d\u201cBut that means you have to have those people on your side for Master Uphilia to succeed to the throne\u2026?\u201c\u2026 I guess this is also a guy named Challenge Letter for that guy. Phew.\u201dSquirting small, then Uffi smiles invincibly. We all laughed bitterly at the smile that we had never seen before, even if it was belligerent.Surely Uffi is more willing if he says which of us wants to be king. Uffi must henceforth bring together the faction of which he will be king.\u201cWe don\u2019t work hard together, but we wish together. Let\u2019s do our best, Uffi.\u201d\u201cYes, Anis\u2026. Well, I\u2019m not used to calling you that yet.\u201dAnis, and. I sank when the shock ran like Yufi grabbed me in the chest after laughing at me again.\u2026 because it\u2019s not good for the heart to do that with time difference! Don\u2019t even laugh at Ilia and Raini!\u201cWell. Then I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re welcome to come\u201dThe next morning, me and Uffi were dropped off by Ilia and Raini to leave the palace behind. I walk alongside Uffi because the road is with me on the way. There is no conversation between us on the road. Still has a strange sense of satisfaction.\u201cMm-hmm. Then I\u2019m this way.\u201d\u201cYep\u2026\u2026. anis\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re coming\u201d\u201cYeah. Come on in\u201dI smile back at Yufi who smiles, too. Just a little bit of remnants. I\u2019m going down the road to the Ministry of Magic. Drop Yufi off and I\u2019ll walk away, too.It was the Department of Defense who called Lord Grants. I\u2019ve never been here before. This will be a department that receives reports of the defense and policing of the country, the emergence of demons from each territory, and carries out work related to the defense of the country.Will it be an organizational chart that says each Knights is attached under this Ministry of Defense? The fact that I have never been involved with the Ministry of Defense before is that I simply have no contact.I do fight demons as adventurers in material hunting, but I wasn\u2019t directly involved in the defense of the country. There was no reason for the Knights to be involved, but for the Ministry of Defense above them.(uhh\u2026 you\u2019re a little nervous in that sense)What people are at the top. Lord Grants knows, but he doesn\u2019t know what people are around him. I was smoked like a snake scorpion in the Ministry of Magic, but what\u2019s it gonna be like over here?Anxiety is approximated to the section where the Ministry of Defense is operating. Compared to the Ministry of Magic, it seems qualitative. The Ministry of Magic building also had a season in it, but I have the impression that this one is understated and simply obsolete compared to that one.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Princess Anisphere\u201d\u201cThat, Captain Sprout Knights?At the entrance, I encounter the head of the Sprout Knights, who was recently becoming a familiar face. Apparently they were expecting me.\u201cI will be your guide today.\u201d\u201cIs the Kingsguard Knights leader himself?\u201cYep. The Knights belong to the lower part of the Ministry of Defense, because the head of each Knights regiment also has a say in the Ministry of Defense. It\u2019s a little complicated to stand in, but that\u2019s why I asked for Princess Anisphere\u2019s guide.\u201d\u201c\u2026 in order for the Ministry of Defense to take command in the normal course of life and, in the event of an incident, to turn to the Knights for judgment?All the Knights Sprout did to my question was smile. I think about what the sincerity of that smile is.Is that what you want to do to make the crime scene a priority? But when you leave it to the field, there is no uniformity, so you take the time and make it that way? I\u2019m not exhausted.\u201cShall I come then? Lord Grants and the Secretary of Defense are waiting.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Speaking of which, you\u2019ve never had much of an exchange with the Secretary of Defense.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an extraction of Your Majesty and Lord Grants\u2026. because if the Secretary of Defense ate too much into politics, he could have inspired the Ministry of Magic. So far, huh?Blur, and nod to the whispered words in his ear to show.You\u2019re about to get me wrong, but Lord Grants stands in the prime minister\u2019s position. It is not a direct report of the Ministry of Defense, but rather a status that belongs above it.So in the context of political consultation, Lord Grants sums it up and it becomes a structure to move the Department of Defense. Until now, I have not questioned it, but it also seems odd that the Secretary of the Ministry of Magic is present and the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence is not.Well, maybe the position of the Ministry of Magic has no choice because it also has the role of advisor to the king. I don\u2019t know the details, so I can\u2019t help thinking about it. We\u2019re going to learn about an organization called the Ministry of Defense.With that in mind, I arrive at the secretary\u2019s office of the Secretary of Defense, guided by the Knights of Sprout.\u201cThe Duke of Magenta is already waiting for you. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChief Sprout Knights knocks and then speaks the language of entry. Confirm the reply from inside before proceeding with the door opened to me by the Knights Commander.It was Lord Grants waiting inside, and Grandpa with a big giant. It\u2019s the kind of physique you call a samurai to see, making you feel old but not fading.\u201cOh, Princess Anisphere! It\u2019s an honor to have you here!\u201cUh, ah, yes\u201dHe rang the footsteps that seemed to rock the floor and held both hands with his hands that he might be two times bigger than me. Even the back length is huge without losing hand. If you are approached close range, you will not be able to see your face until you look up.Sometimes I\u2019m small! It seems like there\u2019s a 2m or something like that, but this grandfather. Awesome impact, strong pressure of first encounter impression\u2026\u2026!\u201cWas it the last time I saw you as a child? Do you remember Nong\u2019s name?\u201cWhat, um, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha! I can\u2019t help it! Whatever. Princess Anisphere has been magically intrigued since she was a child! It\u2019s very natural for a boneless grandfather to forget! It would be an honor if you remembered Non\u2019s name again! Non is Dillcent Endive! It\u2019s the old age of the Duke of Endive house!\u201c\u2026 of the House of the Duke of Endive?\u201cUhm! The current Duke is a nobleman! Because I just let the old bones inherit the housekeeper!House of the Duke of Endive. To my knowledge, it is a duke house with a shallow history compared to the Duke of Magenta family. I don\u2019t hear many names because I\u2019m still shallow in history.When I say Duke\u2019s house, I guess it\u2019s because of Lord Grants that the Magenta Duke family floats.\u201cDon\u2019t even call me Grandpa Dill! Even if they call me Duke or Secretary, I feel itchy!!\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never been treated before. They come all the way here and drink me. I try not to break my grin even though I manage to give an ambiguous reply.\u201cDilcent old. Greetings will be there by then.\u201d\u201cOoh! Sorry, Grants!Lord Grants walked in between me coughing. Old Dilcent sat back in his chair when he heard Lord Grants. Is the chair a special order, too, very large? Somehow it makes me look amazing.It was Lord Grants who set the scene apart, in the atmosphere of finally proceeding.\u201cFirst of all, Princess Anisphere. Good luck investigating the Spirit Contract\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cAt His Majesty\u2019s decision, temporarily, I think the country will also emerge. We look forward to seeing Princess Uphilia in the Ministry of Magic as the next generation of people in charge.\u201dUffi in my brain smiled and exhaled evil, \u201cYou say it often,\u201d but I shake it off and leave a vague grin on it.\u201cSo how am I supposed to do in the Department of Defense\u2026\u2026?\u201cUhm! Quick, that\u2019s the point! Grants, wait for me!Old Dilcent comes out laughing with childish innocence.To the intensity of that pressure I take a few steps back as I lean back.\u201cRegardless, we hope to deploy you to the Knights of Demon Props! I\u2019d prefer to go across to all the Knights if I could! Just that delightful patterned sword! Plus, I want to get a head count of flying magic items that Princess Anisphere is riding around! Is the production of magic props a personal production? Then you also need a budget to attach a contract to a major workshop!I accidentally rounded my eyes. Flight magic props for Mana Blade, maybe Airdra? Or is it a mould? Well, there\u2019s no way there\u2019s any stock going over to the Knights either way. Even Mana Blade isn\u2019t enough, and I can\u2019t do more flying magic equipment.It was so sudden that I waited for old Dilcent.\u201cHey, wait a minute, Dilcent, old man!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cMmm, isn\u2019t Grandpa Dill good for you? He\u2019s a relative, but he\u2019s a relative!\u201cWell, that\u2019s true\u2026\u2026 not so! All of a sudden, it\u2019s impossible to spread demonic props to all of the Knights.\u201d\u201cUhm! I know that! But Noon wants to spread the demonic props implementation to the Knights as soon as possible! If so, you will have to take the initiative for mass production! Or is it something that takes a lot of time to make?\u201cDemonic props are not something I can suddenly give to the Knights\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm? Are you saying it\u2019s not finished yet? But isn\u2019t it the iron rule of object making that you can\u2019t make something better if you have to prototype it?\u201cWell, that\u2019s true\u2026 why, all of a sudden, is it that big a story?I turned my gaze from old Dilcent to Lord Grants without concealing my confusion. I can\u2019t go on without asking what the hell the intent is. It skips too many stages.But Lord Grants remains silent even when his gaze is turned from me. Then Lord Dilcent pointed his lips. It\u2019s a kid-like obstinate way, but honestly it doesn\u2019t look too good on me and I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201cMmm, didn\u2019t Princess Anisphere finally raise her heavy hips?\u201cHeavy hips\u2026 suddenly surprised me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s sudden! Non has been complaining to Grants! And Matthew! Don\u2019t you think this guy is a man with no blood or tears!?\u201d\u201cWell, well, old Dilcent. Please calm down.\u201dIt was the Knights of Sprout who broke in between. Stand between old Dilcent and me to forgive the excitement. Then he looks at me with a slightly troubled grin.\u201cBut it means exactly what you say. Princess Anisphere, we would like to deploy the magic tools to all the Knights if they are to be popular even now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t that a joke or something?\u201cThink about it, Princess Anisphere. You know better than anyone how effective and valuable it is to deploy magic items to the Knights. That\u2019s not just about equipment. For example, the magic artifact that was shown at the recent exhibition of the Ministry of Magic to help with life. That\u2019s also what I\u2019m looking for so much for the Knights that I can get my hands out of my throat. Especially the Knights who belong to the periphery are the strong ones. They have a lot of camping opportunities.\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201dI can certainly nod if you ask me. Even Mana Blade is an easy-to-carry device in the first place, and if Mana Blade is popular, it simply reduces the weight of the sword.You can also use the magic props of daily items in the open air. Even one insulation pot can improve the environment of the camp. There is no explanation for flying magic props.\u201cIt is the people on the front line who are looking for inventions by Princess Anisphere\u2019s magic. Yet, Grants, I\u2019m just telling you to put up with what you\u2019ve done so far!\u201cAs I have said many times, it was Princess Anisphere\u2019s will, and it took time to maintain peace in the country.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you waited! If we finally get the recognition, shouldn\u2019t we launch it as a state business to name the country!? This is a huge step forward, Grants!\u201cI know. I know. Yes. But if you think about your position, you know you can\u2019t snort.\u201d\u201c\u2026 uhm\u201dUnconsciously, old Dilcent lurked his eyebrows. No, I had my own position, too, so let\u2019s spread magic and gain power, I didn\u2019t think of anything.Then the head of the Sprout Knights opened his mouth with a bitter smile.\u201cThe Ministry of Defense is in a complicated position, Princess Anisphere.\u201d\u201cA complicated position?\u201cThe Department of Defense has many houses that have once again welcomed as ministers the nobility who revolted against His Majesty the King of Orphans, or the grandfather of Princess Anisphere. So the Department of Defense is distanced from politics.\u201dThat is certainly complicated, once again welcoming the nobles with their blades to the royal family as ministers. I don\u2019t think Father would have abandoned all the nobles because of how many wars there were. Should I say that if I take a good view, I am tempered, and if I take a bad view, I have sold my thanks?I feel like I can\u2019t help but be distanced from politics by a faction with such a justified aristocracy. Apart from whether that\u2019s good or bad.\u201cI can speak for myself. But as a Ministry of Defense, I can\u2019t afford to lose my power in pranks. Most importantly, it is the people of our country. Then it was only once that I confronted my responsibilities and decided that my government would entrust them to the King. There is no falsehood in that belief.\u201dSeverely, Old Dilcent tells. The two arms assembled had more force than was necessary to make his whole body look shivering.\u201cIn that regard, Grants, who took it between us and the king, has nothing to be thankful for. But! That\u2019s it! There is also a desire to fight demons on the ground and to labor knights who are struggling to protect their people! If there is anything better, I want to incorporate it and use it as a force! Therefore, I have been waiting for the time when Princess Anisphere\u2019s invention of magic will be spread to the world!Old Dilcent can roar as he unwraps the arms he was putting together and pounds his fist on his desk with momentum.The frightening indoor air trembles and a voice sounds as if it is going to shake its core.\u201cYou just have to let the politics and other wise people do it! We don\u2019t have time for revenge on kings or politics! That being said, for those who have no ears to hear, and the suffering of the people! I don\u2019t even know how hard the knights struggle! Then there\u2019s no reason to ask!!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m in trouble, didn\u2019t Lord Grants take it for me\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm! So I told you, leave it to the wise! Say the Grants have the chance to spread their magic! Be brave and say what\u2019s wrong!!\u201d\u201cSo things need something called order or rooting\u2026\u201dWith his hips low, the head of the Sprout Knights is laying his words down to calm old Dilcent.I just have a little sympathy for Lord Grants, who is sighing deeply beside it and suppressing his temples.\u2026 Well. You\u2019re lying if I can\u2019t even respond to thoughts you\u2019ve had so far, right? I don\u2019t want to lie about the feeling that struck this heart. Nature and grin come from the bottom of my heart.\u201cDilcent old. No, I dare you to call me Grandpa Dill. Let me be clear. I don\u2019t want a throne or anything.\u201d\u201cHo?\u201cI created magic for me. Because I couldn\u2019t use magic, I knitted magic for myself. It was born for the good of the people.\u201dYes, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been running through wanting to be able to use my magic.The destination is not a \u201cking\u201d. It\u2019s a wizard.\u201cMy magic is magic to make someone smile. If it\u2019s for someone\u2019s smile, I\u2019ll do as much magic as I can. But it\u2019s not the throne you want ahead of you. I want to do something for this country as a wizard. Can I help you with that? I want to be a\u201c knight, \u201cnot a\u201d subordinate. \u201dNot as someone who serves me, but as someone who wants strength to protect those who deserve it.\u201dI offer my hand to Grandpa Dill. Look straight in the eye.Grandpa Dill looks back on me, too. And I laughed to peel my teeth out.\u201cDo you want power? What\u2019s that power for?\u201cI want power for the knights, the people, the country!Then we\u2019re comrades.\u201cUhm! Then Princess Anisphere!\u201cTo the best of your ability, let me give you my wisdom. And for that, I need your help.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s respond! With the pride of the knight!!\u201dGrandpa Dill\u2019s big hand holds my hand. I\u2019m a little dressed up for shaking hands, but my mind made sense.Yeah. You forgot because you\u2019ve been growing up lately. I always say! Be honest with yourself! Be honest! Be straight! What a wreck! You do what you want, you win!\u201cCome on, Lord Grants! Let\u2019s talk budget! And the Sprout Knights Commander! If you have a major workshop with handouts, introduce us! My holding blacksmith is going to embrace me too, but how many minutes bigotry does it break bones to persuade me! Please also help us in that regard! There\u2019s so much to discuss!Come on, let\u2019s get started. Do my magic for me again from here. To deliver magic to make everyone smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66: 66\u201cTomasoo! Let\u2019s ask!\u201c\u2026 can you come any quieter, Master Anis\u201dI call Tomas well as I open the Gana Workshop door vigorously. Tomas, who was working in the workshop, stopped his hand and looked at me. Relieved on the same Buddha top surface.\u201cTomas! I need a job!\u201cWork?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to make next?\u201cTomas! I want you to come under me as a technical advisor!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 what?After plenty of room, he leaked his voice like Tomas had been taken aback.I breathe and tell him again with a full grin.\u201cTechnical advisor!\u201cWait, what are you talking about?\u201cPermission came out of the country to mass-produce magic inventions. So I want Tomas to officially hold the position of mentoring and expressing his opinions under me as a technical advisor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 what?A voice like the second time I was taken aback. Did he start having headaches, put his fist down to slap him on the forehead several times, and then Tomas closed his lid tightly.\u201c\u2026 does that mean state business? You want me to be your technical advisor?\u201cTomas is the best contributor to the development of magic. That\u2019s why Tomas is good. It\u2019s Tomas who understands my philosophy, no matter what major workshop I signed up for. So I can\u2019t think of anything but Tomas.\u201d\u201cAre you nuts!? I\u2019m a civilian, this little workshop blacksmith!? You can\u2019t possibly act as a technical advisor to me like that!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wear as many as I can for an assistant! If you still say you don\u2019t like Tomas, this will be your last solicitation! Tomas, give me your talent!!\u201dWhether you want to mass produce inventions of magic or develop them, you can\u2019t take Tomas off anymore. I don\u2019t want to take it off rather.His strength could be amply demonstrated in the Celestial. In the future, I want Tomas on the stage of the accelerated invention of magic.I gaze into his eyes to convey such thoughts. Tomas was opening his eyes and looking me in the eye, but soon he would stray from face to face.\u201c\u2026 why am I doing this for the nobles?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of pan Tomas has in his nobility. I don\u2019t want to hear from myself anymore. But I really want Tomas\u2019 talent. I want you to see the world I see, and I want you to expand it. And it\u2019s not just for nobility. The knights who defended this country wanted power from me to protect their country and their people. He said that with inventions of magic, we could make this country better. I want to live up to that thought. That\u2019s why I need your help, Tomas.\u201dI don\u2019t know what I could do alone. I still remember the feeling of powerlessness that I didn\u2019t have the power I wanted. Still, I kept looking forward. I think even the force has followed me. Still, there are many things you can\u2019t do alone.So I hope you can help me. I want you to hold hands and get up on the stage with me. That will one day revolve around and help everyone. I\u2019m sure even Tomas gets something if he\u2019s involved in developing demonic props. Because I want it to be, and I want it to be.For a little while, Tomas, who remained silent, groans as he scratches his head indiscriminately.\u201c\u2026 Seriously, what is it?\u201cI mean it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 chip. I wish I had kicked you out without telling you anything the first time I saw you. Same thing you did back then.\u201d\u201cBye!\u201cGive me time! \u2026\u2026\u2026 think\u201d\u201cOkay!\u2026 you know, Tomas. Knights also have civilian knights. If I succeed in that, my invention may spread among the people as well. I definitely want to take this chance. Because he wants Tomas to follow the same path.\u201dI lay my own hands on Tomas\u2019 hands. Thomas turned his gaze toward me for just a moment, but he immediately turns his back by paying his hand. This is a manifestation of Tomas\u2019 will to reject. I don\u2019t think any more conversations with him will yield a fruitful response.Keep looking at Tomas\u2019 back and then I turn my back trying to get the workshop behind me. I heard Tomas inquiring on my back like that.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis, what are you? Are you nuts? Is that just reckless? Are you the Princess of Desolation\u2026?\u201cWhat am I? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dWe don\u2019t look back on each other. I try to whine with my gaze straight.\u201cThe Wizard.\u201dI knew there was no response from Tomas. I kept the door shut in my back and left the Gana workshop behind.\u201cRaini! I\u2019m home! Sorry for the sudden, but I have business with Baron Cyan, so I\u2019d like to interrupt Baron Cyan\u2019s house!\u201cWelcome back, Master Anisphere. In the meantime, let\u2019s stop once because Raini is surprised.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dWith his leg back from the Gana workshop, he went straight to the outhouse, where he tried to jump out with Raini, who picked him up, and Ilia pulled his collar. Yes, my breath\u2026\u2026! I thought my throat would crush\u2026\u2026!Raini, who was held by me, is moving into Ilia\u2019s hands. Raini looks at me with her eyes properly, and Ilia exhales a frightened sigh, as usual, before asking me.\u201cSo, what happened all of a sudden?\u201cYou said you wanted to invite Baron Cyan to verify the performance of the inventions of magic before, right? I\u2019m going to do you that favor!\u201cLike I said for sure\u2026\u2026 eh now!? let me at least put a newsletter in the house once!? Your father will graduate even if Master Anis suddenly comes!!\u201d\u201cSo is that, okay. Then hurry up as fast as you can! Me, I\u2019m going back to the Knights again! I\u2019ll see you later!That\u2019s all I say, I slip through the sides of the two of them and head inside the outhouse. Go inside your workshop and take what you need from one end back to the entrance. And jump out as it is.He waves to Ilia, who is holding his head with Raini, who remains flat, and runs vigorously towards the royal castle with all his might.\u201c\u2026 what is it? That.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve returned that destructiveness\u2026\u201dI never heard Raini and Ilia talking like that.Run, run. Just run as hard as you can. My heart beats and my breath goes up. But even that was comfortable and kicked the ground with momentum.What arrived was a knight\u2019s practice area. I try to jump in towards the knights who were doing the archery there and land.\u201cDuh!?, Princess Anisphere!? What are you doing!?\u201d\u201cOh man! I\u2019m sorry, this! Can you give it to the Knights Commander? Tell him you can let him go. Because this is all we have now!\u201cThis is\u2026 what, this is Mana Blade that Master Anisphere used\u2026?\u201cYes! That\u2019s all I have now, so use it alternately, whether someone wins or not, until I give it to the Knights Commander! Of which, we\u2019ll have all the numbers! Oh, I\u2019d be so glad to hear your thoughts on using them in the report if you like!\u201cOh, hey!? Princess Anisphere!?\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m going next! Sorry!\u201dI asked Tomas to become a technical adviser. I asked Baron Cyan to tell Raini that he wanted to invite me as a demon prop performance tester. Mana Blade came to the Knights for what she could put out in the current inventory.I will sort out the cases I did with my fingerprints. The next thing you need to do is secure the Spirit Stone. I have some build-up, too, but that\u2019s not enough. You can\u2019t even buy up the spiritual stones of the market because there are people\u2019s lives.Then can you accommodate the spiritual stones stored in the royal castle? Since that is within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic, the next place to go shall be designated as the Ministry of Magic.(I guess I\u2019ll see how Uffi is at last)I haven\u2019t had a moment to talk to Yufi slowly because I\u2019m moving to spread the word about the magic props. He had a face that didn\u2019t seem particularly problematic, but maybe he just didn\u2019t say anything because it was about Yufi.I can\u2019t do anything for you to solve the problems of the Ministry of Magic. If there\u2019s anything I can do, I\u2019d rather not get my hands on Yuffi\u2019s problem unless Yuffi wants it\u2026. I might get a little impatient.(I hope you\u2019re doing well.)Stop running to the boulder where you came in front of the Ministry of Magic. Even you\u2019re in a position to inspire the Ministry of Magic, so you don\u2019t have to caress your nerves inadvertently, do you?When I go straight into the Ministry of Magic building, I gather the gaze of the people who were inside. Hino, I think someone leaked a frightened voice. Who!? Who just reacted with such disrespect!?Others are looking at me with their voices lurking. This is obviously not welcome. No, I\u2019m not asking you to welcome me because I\u2019m here all of a sudden!? I won\u2019t take anything and eat it!?\u201cPrincess Anisphere!\u201cHmm?\u2026 Oh, Marion!It was Marion who spoke to me in that. Marion comes to my side on a small run. Then he smiles with a troubled bitterness and flaunts his shoulder.\u201c\u2026 you can often show your face to the Ministry of Magic without an appointment, you are\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause I was in a hurry? Lord Zildu has a favor to ask\u2026\u201d\u201cWere you\u2026 But don\u2019t imitate bad for your heart. But even now, the Ministry of Magic is tingling.\u201dMarion reminds me to pay attention as I dive into my voice and whisper\u2026. Yeah, is that so magic ministry not good air?When I had my doubts from that thought, Marion looked complicated. I think it says on my face, \u201cGive me a break.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I wonder what the fuss is, are you again?\u201cOh, Count Voltaire\u2019s son?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t mind Lang. With all due respect, Princess Anisphere. Would you mind behaving a little more as a royal, no, heir to your blood? Because the field will be confused by pranks.\u201dLaughing only at his face, Lang approaching, wrapped around an obviously grumpy aura. It\u2019s reprimand jumping out of your mouth. I flatter myself with it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m just in a hurry, I want to talk to you as soon as I can\u2026\u201d\u201cJust because you\u2019re in a hurry doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to lose your respect as a royalty, does it? Why can\u2019t you learn something called shame?\u2026 the words that I should have been able to flush usually came to my mind for some reason. Bum, and I think I heard something hang up.\u201c\u2026 you want that from me now? Mostly the Ministry of Magic didn\u2019t like me to be king, did it? This is a great opportunity to banish me from the royal family, isn\u2019t it? Then you should just say it, right? No magic of disqualifying royalty.\u201dI think the air in the field has cooled off at once. Lang\u2019s smile disappeared, and his face was all at once drawn to it.\u2026 Shit. I\u2019ve been cold on my head since I said that. My spine gets cold at once. I accidentally got blood on my head and my mouth slipped. He\u2019s the one I shouldn\u2019t totally say. This!Even Marion is quietly shaking his head left and right. Can\u2019t you do any more? Yeah, there\u2019s something to tell you, Marion! I don\u2019t think it tastes good either!\u201cHey\u2026! What do you think, such as being told that?!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, Princess Anisphere! Please calm down, Lang too!Marion\u2019s breaking in between and trying to contain it, but I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a little upset! I\u2019m so sorry! I also shut my mouth on the boulder.The air is completely chilled out. This is disgusting. It was too fatal a rudeness. Right now, at least it wasn\u2019t a good dialogue I said in the Ministry of Magic. Ahhh, what do we do!?\u201c\u2026 What the hell is all this noise?And the sound of it sounded good.It was Yufi who threw a stone at the nervous air whilst sounding his shoes. Unexpectedly I pull my cheeks too. Ya suck\u2026\u2026!Yufi\u2019s mad! Totally against me!\u201cNo, the, uh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 anise\u201dI inadvertently stretch my spine. Yufi\u2019s eyes are staring at me with jito eyes\u2026\u201c\u2026 If you need help, it will be common sense to ask for an appointment in advance. I don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like to stick out, but it\u2019s too much of a detour to boulders.\u201d\u201cThere are no words\u2026\u201d\u201cNot to mention, I\u2019m not behaving well enough to bring up another story and bite because they pointed out the nonsense of my behavior\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust because you don\u2019t want to be king, don\u2019t act like you ever did. You\u2019re here for understanding, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re here for help, aren\u2019t you?\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse\u2026\u201dI really can\u2019t say anything back. What Yufi says can only get smaller after all.Seeing me get smaller, Yuffi sighed deeply.\u201cI\u2019m going to the Ministry of Magic in the first place, so you don\u2019t visit me in person, do you?\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re absolutely right, yes. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve also been wondering if Uffi is working hard with a little lightness. But I should have waited for Uffi to come back to the outhouse. That was all we talked about, and I made it extra easy.\u201cAnis.\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201d\u201c\u2026 what can I do for you?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201c\u2026 I wanted an inventory of spiritual stones to develop magic props, and I was wondering if I could accommodate them from the inventory managed by the Ministry of Magic\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. I will tell that to Acting Director Jiltu, and I will move on. So.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Take a little breath, and then Yuffi looks at me like she\u2019s staring at me.\u201cGo home.\u201d\u2026 I said that out in a terribly cold voice.No, I think it\u2019s out of line to be shocked, and overall I\u2019m sorry I was a detour. So I nodded one and turned my back.The feeling that was floating shriveled. I drop my shoulders and exhale. I hold my head back as it is.Wow! I did it already ~!!\u201cI want to be a cat\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it when you suddenly leave and think you\u2019re back\u2026\u201d\u201cI went to the Ministry of Magic and lost my word. And Yufi was furious.\u201d\u201cWith all due respect, you\u2019re an idiot, aren\u2019t you?Yes, it\u2019s stupid.I accidentally get a headache and push my forehead against Raini\u2019s knee. I was depressed by my idiocy additions and subtractions as Raini put a knee pillow on me.\u201c\u2026 I guess he was floating\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it, already\u201dThat\u2019s right. There is a deep sigh of relief in Raini\u2019s response. It\u2019s really too much silence, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s me on the boulder either. But I stumbled into my mouth.\u2026 I wonder if there was that air too. Scared of me, the air of fear. Maybe he enjoyed it more than I thought.\u201c\u2026 you should have stopped. The Anisphere has changed.\u201dIt was Ilia who groaned pompously. If you look at Ilia\u2019s face only to the side, there is a profound color of regret.\u201c\u2026 right? Have I changed that much?\u201cBecause I used to give up making others understand there. So you have a sense of change from when it was good, right?\u201c\u2026 I think so.\u201dMaybe that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t stand Lang\u2019s words. Maybe I couldn\u2019t keep my emotions down because I couldn\u2019t give up understanding from others.I\u2019ve finally felt what I wanted more than I thought I would. There are people waiting for their magic tricks. Wish or fulfill if you can help such people.Finally I can reach it. Finally, finally.\u201c\u2026 I was in a hurry, me\u201dI was finally convinced to say it myself. I was in a hurry, so when I got in my way, I exposed my emotions to the point of excess. This is not a good trend.\u201c\u2026 Huh, I should have talked to Yufi\u2026\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dA hard voice was heard from the entrance. Soon Yufi stood at the entrance. The look is frowning and looking at me.Face up from Raini\u2019s knee pillow and I look straight at Yufi\u2019s face. Then I bow my head.\u201c\u2026 sorry, Uffi. I took care of him.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely, how much liver Me and Marion have chilled. \u2026 be careful already\u201dUffi reaches out to me in a deep sigh. After Yuffi\u2019s hand touches my cheek, I\u2019m pressed to align my forehead.\u201c\u2026 If you hadn\u2019t been angry, I might have been. And yet you may not be convinced to say this.\u201d\u201cUgh. That\u2019s what makes Yuffi annoying. I shouldn\u2019t have shown my face to the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. At least now the Ministry of Magic is highly stimulating for Annis to go. I should have talked to you sooner.\u201dDistort your expression so that Uffi, with his forehead off, will regret it\u2026. Huh? Is it such an unsavory situation to have a Ministry of Magic?\u201cCould it be considerably worse than I think?\u201cProbably for sure. \u2026 and honestly, there are many unexpected places.\u201dLet\u2019s talk about the area, and Yuffi cuts out the conversation and we surround the table.Ilia brews the tea quickly, and when she gets to all of them, Uffi squeezes her expression and speaks out.\u201cTo be clear, the Ministry of Magic now is on the verge of division and could decompose in the air\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYou\u2019re lying, right? That Ministry of Magic?\u201cThe balance of power so far has collapsed with the truth of the Spirit covenant. Until now, it was the faith-heavy who had a strong voice, but when I became a spiritual contractor, my affirmation of magic led to discord within the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t say anything about that.\u201dExcessive spiritual faith can lead to unwanted tragedies. So with the implication of waiting there, there is also the thought that we spoke the truth of the Spirit covenant.Therefore, I was thinking that the force diagram within the Ministry of Magic would be rewritten. Anyway, the Ministry of Magic is still in the process of restructuring. So much so that I thought this was the only time to wait.\u201cBut you assumed it was even Ufi there, right?\u201cYep. So I was also thinking of measures for that. But it was worse than I assumed\u2026 the emotional side.\u201d\u201cEmotional?\u201cThis is the problem before the Ministry of Magic\u2019s force map. It was hard to talk to Anis just about it\u2026\u201dA deep wrinkle is engraved between Yufi\u2019s brows. Uffi exhaled as she held her fingers down to rub the wrinkles between her brows.\u201cMany of the aristocrats in the Ministry of Magic are now frightened of Anise.\u201d\u201c\u2026 frightened, to me?I think they were hostile, but the thing is they\u2019re scared of me\u2026?\u201cThere is simply the truth about the spiritual covenant, and fear of the anise that has elucidated it. Some are afraid to resent Anise because they know the truth, but because of it, they distrust the Spirit, to divert their attention from it.\u201d\u201cResentment to distract\u2026 troublesome\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also troublesome\u2026 the most troublesome are those who are politically afraid of anise\u201d\u201cAre you politically afraid?\u201cIt is true that many who belong to the Ministry of Magic, whether they are themselves or not, have treated Annis coldly. So many fear retaliation for it\u2026. I know it\u2019s a selfish story.\u201d\u2026 Uh, yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to react.Uffi is reluctant to talk to me. \u2018Cause I don\u2019t know what to say. Probably the closest I can get to saying that I\u2019m frightened.\u201cYeah. Just so we\u2019re clear\u2026 I don\u2019t care\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d say\u201dI was sighed at by Ilia, who smiled bitterly. Because I really don\u2019t care from the bottom of my heart!?\u201cRetaliation is retaliation for what? Have you been cheating on me? That does come to mind, but politically what\u2026?\u201cSo to wrap up the Ministry of Magic, I can\u2019t wrap it up without putting it under my asylum first\u2026 it looks like I have anise and I\u2019m not getting credit\u201dI don\u2019t know what to say, I think that\u2019s a story that\u2019s getting a headache.Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine the feeling. Few people would not be anxious if what they had believed had been lost and their common sense changed.So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad. But you\u2019re too suspicious to talk about it.\u201c\u2026 I wonder if the impact was too great\u201d\u201cBetter than we thought.\u201dNow Uffi is reluctant to talk to me. I think I\u2019ve been floating around lately because I can spread magic. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to water it there. If you noticed there, you might have been able to turn your mind, but you\u2019re too unconscious.No, my unconsciousness or something is good at this point, later. It is also difficult for the Ministry of Magic to decompose in the air as it is.\u201cBut it\u2019s a matter of heart\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s hard to solve when that Daiyuan is caused by fear and fear of me. The only way to overcome fear is to make the person forget the fear or get over it. Otherwise, it would be an out-of-the-spot solution.I can\u2019t do that. At least not as a nobleman. That\u2019s why I think Uffi\u2019s bothering his head too, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he can do anything to me\u2026\u201c\u2026 Um, Master Uphilia\u201d\u201cRaini?\u201d\u201cFear is the problem, isn\u2019t it? Then\u2026 can you let me help you?Raini, who had listened to us in silence, turned to Uffi with a firm expression of determination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: 67\u201cRaini, you really can\u2019t do this, can you?\u201cYes, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201dAnxiously, Anisphere tells Raini to make a push. Raini, guided by Anisphere, nods again and again with a bitter smile.It has been decided that Raini will accompany Ufilia to the Ministry of Magic from today. To help the Ministry solve the problems it has.Behind the anisphere is Ilia refraining. Based on the failure of Anisphere the other day, I was to accompany you as a visitor.\u201cYou do it right, Raini\u201d\u201cYes, please keep Ilaria on track\u201d\u201cI will do good, Master Anisphere.\u201d\u201cIs that me!?\u201dAnisphere and Ilia break up on the parting road to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Magic with their usual interactions. Raini, who dropped that back off with Ufiria, held her chest and exhaled softly.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Master Uphilia\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cMaster Uphilia?\u201c\u2026 let me also say it from me. Try not to force it, Raini.\u201d\u201cOf course. But this is the place to work.\u201dUphilia was looking at Raini\u2019s face with a little anxiety. But I shake my head left and right to shake off the stray and nod.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRaini has been facing his existence ever since he was discovered to be a vampire.Close to people, demons without people. He who inherits the contraindication business created by his obsession with magic. I kept facing myself like that, and I kept going down the path that had been shown to me by Anisphere.(\u2026 okay. I can do it, I can do it)Raini takes a deep breath at the entrance to the Ministry of Magic. Reinforce your expression and never let your will enter the demonic stone that is assimilating your magic with your heart.Fluffy. The scent overflows from Raini that you wouldn\u2019t notice if you weren\u2019t aware. The scent spreads around like a thin mist.Raini\u2019s magical aptitude is considered water. Since she became a vampire, there is no discernible information as to whether she is the same suitability as before, but Raini still specializes in magic using water as a medium.The mist that spreads thinly from me subsides to the extent that it causes minor discomfort where people are touched. I have felt it before. It is said that Ilia\u2019s assessment is close to perfume.(\u2026 exploration, commencement)To those who touch the spreading fog, spread the \u201cnoiseless sound\u201d that they emit as if it were a fork. The 'sound\u201d spread from Raini bounces back to Raini to echo from those who are struck with the sound as it were.One of the properties of a vampire, mental interference. Raini has so far mutated and fascinated this by unconsciously putting magic into his eyes. That power, which can now be consciously used, was showing new forms again in Raini\u2019s training.(\u2026 sorted by the reaction of looking at Master Uphilia)Uphilia walks dignified in front of Raini, who expands his consciousness. Walking with Raini, she seemed to get more attention from those in the Ministry of Magic than usual. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t even pay attention to Raini, who\u2019s expanding his consciousness and exploring.What is Raini doing? It weighs the \u201cmental state\u201d of the subject echoed by the 'sound without sound\u201d. It can also be described as a kind of reading mindset that explores the response of the other person, rather than dealing with mental interference.(\u2026 in reaction, sorting\u2026 I need to remember my face\u2026!However, the amount of information naturally increases if the scope is broadened. If there is more information than just the number of people, sorting the information to be obtained can be burdensome for Raini. Raini manages his expression by deluding it with his ability to play as a vampire.What we collect is the reaction to Uphilia, and we divide it by \u201chit,\u201d \u201cnormal,\u201d and \u201coff.\u201d And I remember people\u2019s faces, and I carve them into my memory so I don\u2019t get it wrong.\u201cNormal\u201d is a person who reacted neither to poison nor to medication. \u201cOff\u201d is one who is hostile to Uphilia and himself. And \u201chit\u201d is not to say friendly, but not hostile.That\u2019s how Raini picks up the hearts and minds of the people she meets in the Ministry of Magic as she walks after Uphilia. What I feel is the amount of \u201cnormal\u201d. And the next most common is \u201coff\u201d, which can be divided to say \u201chit\u201d to give way to one step.However, this task had placed a significant burden on Raini. There were times when the consciousness was blurred, and there were times when things seemed blurred. Every time I consume magic and regenerate myself, I feel tired.Nevertheless, the magic continued to be consumed, so Raini had to stop spraying the fog where he caught sight of the reaction of the dizzying person.\u201c\u2026 are you okay? Raini.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fine, I\u2019m tired\u201dI guess Ufiria quickly realized that Raini had stopped spraying the fog. Enter the blind spot to avoid the eyes and reach out to guide Raini.Raini\u2019s cheeks were so feverish that Ufiria\u2019s hands felt limp. Where I can\u2019t see it, I\u2019m scratching my sweat. It is visible and obvious that it was an act that required so much concentration.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s not a complimented use\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? There are many things that can be applied with that power\u2026. because that\u2019s what you did for me. And most importantly, I allowed it. Be confident, Raini.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dRaini suggested a way to use vampire mental interference to sort out the people in the Ministry of Magic who could be on his side.Preliminary stage of mental interference. Instead of manipulating the other person\u2019s mind, he resonates with himself by touching it and absorbs it. It was Raini\u2019s suggestion to set the course from that extracted information.It was Raini\u2019s overwhelming determination to say that if emotions didn\u2019t make things better, he could help himself to solve them.Initially, Anisphere and Uphilia opposed this. If you do poorly, you may be noticed that Raini is a vampire. You can\u2019t let Raini make such a danger, he said.On the contrary, it was Ilia who pushed Raini\u2019s back. Ilia listened to Raini and agreed with Raini as she stood between the opposing Anisphere and Uphilia.At present, Anisphere and Uphilia, who did not have the means to open it, allowed Reini to read his mind so that he could take root in Reini\u2019s persuasion. This is the sequence of history so far.\u201cYou did a great job. Leave it to me.\u201dAs she stroked Raini\u2019s back as she labored, Uphilia was determined to squirm in her eyes.\u201cMiguel, I need a favor.\u201d\u201cThis is, this is\u2026 Princess Uphilia, what can I do for you? At the princess\u2019s request, no matter what!\u201cThen let me prepare a list of Magic Ministry personnel, a background, and then a sketch. As soon as possible, as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cThis is also in a large order\u201dOffice for Uphilia temporarily prepared in the Ministry of Magic. Uphilia had summoned Miguel to that room and had informed him of his request.Miguel shows his shoulders flaunted by the request he received from Uphilia. I can see interesting, then entertaining emotions on that face.\u201cYou mean it\u2019s gonna collapse in earnest?\u201cYep. That\u2019s why I want information. Can you give me a hand?\u201cFor cheap. Rewards?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you want?\u201cI hope to be close to Baroness Cyan next time, if you will.\u201dMiguel is gazing at Raini without breaking his grin. Raini seems to take a step back by distorting his expression only slightly when seen from Miguel. But I can\u2019t stand pulling my legs back with all my strength in my belly.Although Ufiria frowns only for a moment at Miguel\u2019s response, she immediately nods back to her usual expression.\u201cTo have me or Annis present. If so, let\u2019s have a personal tea party.\u201d\u201cI got in!With a full smile, Miguel accepted a request from Uphilia.The weakness of Uphilia in common with Anisphere, which is the weakness of the connections and lack of information. You have to find an ally to make up for this.Think about Raini\u2019s mind reading and Miguel\u2019s ability to gather information to gather his allies. That was the conclusion that Uphilia and the others had drawn.(Together with Raini\u2019s \u201chit\u201d and Miguel\u2019s intelligence gathering, he creates the foundation to create my faction. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do)The main cause of the problems of the Ministry of Magic lies in the accumulation of fear and antipathy towards Anisphere. The reason for her fear of the Anisphere is that she shows up as threatening many things such as the beliefs, thoughts and positions of the Ministry of Magic. But from those who do not neglect the Anisphere, it can be said that it is just fine.The whole organization is not necessarily moving with a unified idea. Still, the policy of the organization wears color glasses to those who belong to it. That\u2019s why they think that as long as it\u2019s the Ministry of Magic, they\u2019ll be treated cold by the Anisphere.Even Uphilia, who sees herself with such an anisphere, doesn\u2019t open her mind easily. Such a current situation has created a stalemate. That stagnation turns the Ministry of Magic into a poison that brings it closer to a crisis of collapse.It is impossible and unacceptable for Uphilia to overlook it.(If you\u2019re saying the organization leans, you need someone to rebuild. To be the flag, that\u2019s what I do)I think the collapse would have begun sooner or later if it had been established that Anisphere would be king.Anisphere has not made the collapse good. But that\u2019s all I can choose for Anisphere. Ufiria regains her temper that\u2019s why she stood up.\u201cAnis is starting to move. Even I can\u2019t\u2026 lose.\u201dRestructuring of the Ministry of Magic. Once again, set your own goals, saying that this is what you should do.Throughout its long history, the nobility of the Kingdom of Palletia has made it worthwhile and admirable to be able to use magic and to be an excellent user. And it was the Spirit who gave it its value and affirmed it.Therefore the Spirit is a venerable being. It may have been a natural flow for the Spirit\u2019s view to change that way.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.To the aristocracy, the Spirit is a great being that must be honored. That is also equal to God. No, it\u2019s even said that, rather, the Spirit is what God has changed his appearance.For the record, the Spirit Contractor and the Great Spirit may have acted like God in various places, so that they may be told. Although the truth is uncertain.Let\u2019s get back to it.For the Ministry of Magic, in other words, for those who deeply believe in the Spirit Faith, there is no recognition of the Spirit as defined in Anispheric magic. If we admit what Anisphere says, it will lead us to deny the existence that guides us. That\u2019s what I think.Still, I was stuck with the facts. How much was the impact? Even Ufiria couldn\u2019t hide her shock. If you were a regular person, you wouldn\u2019t be blamed for panicking.(It\u2019s easy if you just break it. But neither I nor Anis want that)It would be a great opportunity to simply dismantle an organization called the Ministry of Magic.But there\u2019s no reason to want it to collapse, and it\u2019s the way Uphilia thinks that makes it difficult. There is no other way for the current order to change than for Anisphere to have uncovered and made public the truth about the Spirit covenant.What Uphilia should do is to be a bridge between the new and the old. For this reason, it is not good if the Spirit Faith is constant. I just strongly believe that we have to change the way it is.The Spirit is not an absolute being, but it is definitely our neighbor. Because it is the other person who can be called the half of the soul.Prayer for the Spirit is something that returns to you like a matching mirror. If you can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019ll break, and if you can poke it through, it\u2019ll be the truth. The Spirit does not guide. I want you to ask the Spirit and get answers so he can think that he is the one who is precious.At the end of it, Anisphere and Uphilia believe that the path is waiting for magic and magic to join hands.There is no need to rebel. As long as we can hold hands together, we\u2019ll be fine. You don\u2019t have to be afraid. There are no enemies. First off, we have to get out of fear or we won\u2019t talk.The current Ministry of Magic needed a guide and an understander. That\u2019s why Uphilia has to get an endorser. But you can\u2019t even make it rampant. Because the words of Ufiria are like thunder to the Ministry of Magic today.We have all the cloth stones for it. It was with Raini\u2019s devotion that Ufiria could not waste this path, a glimmer of light.\u201c\u2026 wait, Anis\u201dI\u2019ll catch up with you soon. Yes. Uphilia shrugged small as she swore to herself.Uphilia Fez Palettia. Her standing, welcomed as an adopted son by the royal family, will be that of a special adviser to the Ministry of Magic. This is a position comparable to that of Anisphere, who was asked by the Ministry of Defense to wave exploitation under Lord Grants.It was those within the Ministry of Magic who had relatively little objection to Anisphere that Uphilia gathered in her own office. But the color of nervousness is dark with them. I can\u2019t help it because I\u2019m in a position where I might not be able to turn my white eyes right now just because of the title of belonging to the Ministry of Magic.They could well be described as neutral and, worse still, opportunistic forces. Inside such a Ministry of Magic, they were shaders, and they could not hide their confusion as to why they were being summoned by Princess Uphilia.\u201cRelax first. Raini, bring him some tea.\u201d\u201cYes, Master Uphilia\u201dRaini, who refrains beside Uphilia, behaves with tea to those who have been gathered together in a courtesy. If Raini also hears the rumors, he doesn\u2019t even know why she\u2019s here as a Ufirian samurai.Anxiety crawls over if you also continue to be confused. Strangely, however, I feel that if I mouth the tea Raini put in, the tension will be relieved, and their expressions will only unravel a little.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about right now. An organization called the Ministry of Magic was too inclined to the Spirit Faith. As a result, I could not recognize Anis. Wouldn\u2019t that result in cold treatment from her and loss of her current status and many other things? I think that\u2019s what you think.\u201dAnd all those who were slammed with the stars turned away from Uphilia.They, who had decided to be opportunistic, could not be on the side of Anisphere. I didn\u2019t even want to be an enemy.But isn\u2019t it strange to be seen as an enemy by Anisphere in the brackets of an organization called the Ministry of Magic? Just being in the Ministry of Magic might put you in a position to be treated cold, too. That was a terrible thing for them.\u201cLet me tell you something tough, but I think that\u2019s the result of your choice. You didn\u2019t want to actively deny Annis, but you didn\u2019t try to reach out. Take only your own hands now, that would be a good story for bugs. So I want to talk about this more than I\u2019ve ever talked about before.\u201d\u201c\u2026 from now on, is it?Uphilia\u2019s harsh words bit her lips and stirred up defiance. But I unwittingly gavel at the words of Uphilia that follow.\u201cYes, please be honest. Can I trust that Anise won\u2019t treat you cold? Whatever the answer is, I\u2019ll swallow it and show you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then sweeten to your words. I can\u2019t trust Princess Anisphere. It\u2019s hard to talk in the first place.\u201d\u201cIs it difficult?\u201d\u201cBecause Princess Anisphere did not treat her coldly, because she would not if those who follow her to Princess Anisphere told her not to. Those who support Princess Anisphere will not be able to enter the Ministry of Magic without choosing their words.\u201dNo matter how much Anisphere says, it doesn\u2019t always mimic it around.It is with them that I feel that the Ministry of Magic has continued to be privileged. We even thought that was our pride. However, the wind is slightly disoriented even by the recent scandalous and shocking discovery.\u201cYes. I am also gravely aware of that concern. But Anis won\u2019t stop anymore. Annis has heard a voice wanting herself. I know I don\u2019t have to stop wishing anymore. It is impossible to stop that step. Anise will be the forerunner of our time.\u201dWhat they feared, which was opportunism, was not to break the backbone of the Spirit faith. Our position is threatened. I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s threatened with my position, I even get involved with my family. They have someone to protect.They are in a position to muster respect simply by referring to the Ministry of Magic, and at the same time must take on the jealousy of it. That may deprive you of your advantage by the power of magic. That is what is horrible to them, and also the factor that prevented them from recognizing magic.And now things are starting to happen that I was truly afraid of. Everyone has a dark look on their face.\u201cYou can also choose the path of deference to Anis here, but that will be a betrayal for the Ministry of Magic for a few.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re right\u201d\u201cSo I don\u2019t have any credibility either. No, I have no track record if you ask me if I can protect my family and clan, including you. Different?Nobody answered Uphilia\u2019s question, and she became silent. That silence was the answer above all.Uphilia nodded in response. \u2013 Yes, I was waiting for that, as I said.\u201cIf so, I believe you should be empowered.\u201d\u201c\u2026 build strength, is it?\u201cIf you can\u2019t rely on anyone to protect you, you just have to increase your own power. If you\u2019re an enemy, they think you\u2019re a threat, and if you\u2019re on your side, you\u2019re comfortable. Don\u2019t you think that would pave the way for dialogue? Above all, it will also protect your pride. You don\u2019t have to give in to magic or be hostile. You just have to shoulder to shoulder with magic.\u201dSo Uphilia looks over at everyone. Make sure everyone\u2019s attention is focused, Uphilia tells them.\u201cIf Ennis gives power to people without power through magic, I will behave magically to those with power. My eyes cloud because I fear them. Why don\u2019t you bet on the possibility that now is the time for me to clear up that cloud?\u201c\u2026 do you have specific means?And he that swallowed the lid, inquired of Uphilia. Take that gaze head-on and Uphilia answers.\u201cIf you believe me. I\u2019ll do my best to show you the way.\u201dThe branches were shown here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68: 68\u201c\u2026 Yufi and Raini, I wonder if you\u2019re okay\u201d\u201cAre you that worried?Ilia returns to a sigh of sigh to my grunt. I lay my elbow on my desk and glanced at Ilia with my jitty eyes as I supported my jaw.\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u201cThose two won\u2019t cause any problems. Those kids who are impotent, but I know my limitations. Unlike Master Anisphere.\u201d\u201cMy ear hurts. I was surprised at Raini, but Yufi said something amazing.\u201d\u201cIs that an example plan?\u201cExample plan.\u201d That\u2019s a trump card for Uffi to establish his position in the Ministry of Magic. I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise in the trump card that Yufi showed me either.If that plan materializes, it is definitely a plan that will have a huge impact on the way the future magic is and the way the Ministry of Magic itself is.\u201cIf magic props do penetrate from now on, magic tastes bad unless you review policies and positions from your current position and switch them. The advantages of magic props are that they can be used by anyone and provide stable performance. These two points are huge.\u201d\u201cIf the problems you have to borrow a magic hand to be able to solve in the hands of the people, it\u2019s a problem that will shake the primacy of the nobility.\u201dI nod to Ilia\u2019s reply. One of the factors that can make a nobleman a nobleman is that there are problems that can only be solved by nobility because magic can be used.That has hitherto also been needed for territorial development and territorial defence. It is only natural for a powerful person to assume responsibility.But when the country grows bigger, there are more people to protect. It is nobility that cannot be made up of strength alone, it is the management of the territory.Civilians did not have the immense power of magic, like nobles. The relationship between the nobility and the civilian population was formed because the nobility was able to protect the people by a miracle called magic.Magic can overshadow one such aristocratic advantage, the power of war in self-defense. Demonic props don\u2019t have to be noble to use them. And they take the position of knights and adventurers. If the absolute number increases, you can beat it by the number, even if the magic item can\u2019t cross the magic.If a people who cannot defend themselves can protect themselves, they may be able to do so without protection from the nobles. That leads to the loss of one of the roles that nobility has assumed. Of course, I don\u2019t expect it to be completely gone.\u201cI still think it will have an impact. One of the reasons I\u2019ve been bowing my head to nobility is because it reduces its value.\u201d\u201cThe time has come to revisit the role that magic can play.\u201d\u201cAs always, if you can do more new things, you can do more. I would prefer to work in a different way from magic and magic props if I could.\u201dEven if the value of magic as an aristocratic advantage diminishes, the value of magic itself does not waver. If we want to be proud of magic as an authority of nobility, those who use magic must also accept change.In that sense, I think Uffi\u2019s 'strategy\u201d would be a good way to review the current situation. But the contents\u2026 Honestly, it\u2019s hard to judge. That is certainly impossible for \u201cmagic props\u201d and can only be done with \u201cmagic\u201d. I think if we can do that, we can revolutionize the magic itself.So what the problem is, it essentially has the disadvantage of \u201cmagic\u201d. That\u2019s also in the swordy sense of the blades. Remember the story advocated by Uffi and whine zero into the sigh.\u201c-\u201d Spirit manifestation, \u201cor\u201d\u2013 Anisphere was squeaking, around that time.In the Ministry of Magic, lectures were held in part by those gathered by Uphilia.It was the day of the moment when \u201cconcepts\u201d that could change the course of history, later alongside magic, were spread to the world.\u201c\u2026\u201d Spirit manifestation \u201d?\u201cYes, that\u2019s the new magical figure I want to propose to you in the Ministry of Magic, and I believe it will lead to building a new relationship with the Spirit\u201dUfiria nods as she turns her gaze to the nobles she has gathered. Some of them look like Marion. The aristocrats gathered here spoke out to draw Uphilia into their camp as a prospect, and they agreed with Uphilia.Everyone on this scene is showing a lack of attention and concentration in listening to Uphilia. The attitude can be said to be worthy of those who serve in the Ministry of Magic, which is said to be elite.\u201cWhat is spiritual manifestation different from spiritual covenants?\u201cYes, let\u2019s say something similar and different. I named it spiritual manifestation, but I define this as what exists on the\u201d magic \u201dextension line. Now let me give you an overview.\u201dConfirming that those who have not yet been able to keep up with their understanding can be seen, Uphilia again begins to explain the concepts she advocates.\u201cAs a premise. A spiritual covenant is a communion between a spirit that exists in the world and a spirit that is in one\u2019s soul. It symbolizes the spirit that becomes one\u2019s half body and exchanges souls in exchange for one\u2019s own soul, which elevates the existence to the Great Spirit. So what is spiritual manifestation about this? It\u2019s not communion with spiritual manifestation, but letting the spirits project their magic and will to make them independent, as they use magic.\u201d\u201cAre you independent of the Spirit? Um, I don\u2019t see a connection to how that\u2019s on the magic extension line?\u201cIf I tell you, magic is also a\u201c phenomenon \u201din which the Spirit has changed his appearance. It is the will, prayers and wishes of men that are causing that phenomenon. And it\u2019s magic that transforms existence by gaining the magic that\u2019s the source of it.\u201dUphilia looks over everyone and sees the reaction. Everyone frowns at troubles, puts their fingers on their foreheads, and is immersed in their thoughts with each reaction.\u201cConsider magic to be one of the forms of the figure of the Spirit. And the spiritual manifestation is on the magical extension line because the amount of information is different. This will be the major branch that separates magic from magic props. Beyond being a tool, magic tools require a simple design, but magic, on the contrary, can pack a lot of information and make them independent.\u201d\u201cIs that the strength?\u201cAnis is aware that the magic props are only for\u201d anyone. \u201dIt\u2019s aimed at civilians and people who don\u2019t specialize in magic. Of course, we can benefit those who specialize in magic, but unless we have all our footprints, we will not take precedence. That\u2019s why I think magic should be narrow, deep and professionally switched.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s spiritual manifestation\u2026\u2026?\u201cYes, if you say so.\u201d It produces a Spirit who performs the role he wants. Ultimately, if we can follow the magic of the will, or the Spirit, we can call it an ideal. \u201cSawdust, and someone made a sound of spitting. Without concealing that his voice trembled, the voice of inquiry is thrown at Uphilia.\u201cCan it be said that, in other words, \u2026 the act of shaping the\u201c Spirit \u201din its own hands?\u201cYes. Exactly. And because you are from the Ministry of Magic, it is my desire to move forward with this plan together. \u2026 but\u201dUphilia makes a cold voice sound on the field to water the air that she says is on the verge of boiling.\u201cCreate your own god. It is true that the ultimate form of\u201c spiritual manifestation \u201dto go may be there. But don\u2019t forget. The Spirit is a mirror of the will of men, us. Is that God truly required by the world, or can he be responsible as the one who sends him out to the world of creation? That\u2019s what you have to be ready for.\u201d\u201cReady\u2026\u201d\u201cSpirit manifestations, like magic, have a greater impact on the surroundings. If the Spirit can be manifested as a friend, it must be firmly forbidden to create that friend as a thing directed against his compatriots. You can\u2019t seem to get rid of ideas that are different from your own. Do you understand?If Uphilia tells him to stab the nail, the place will quiet down. Everyone never gives a floating look, but returns his gaze to Uphilia with a tight look.\u201cBesides, once the art of spiritual expression is established, it\u2019s not a dream to work with magic.\u201d\u201cYes, is it?\u201cThe nucleus of a demonic prop is a spiritual stone. And in Annis\u2019 theory, the Spirit Stone is like a carcass where the Spirit has come together and solidified without will. It is my belief that this core power can be replaced or coexisted with spirits created by spiritual manifestations. If it happens, Annis will be happy to accept it.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!?\u201dEveryone looked at their neighbors. Spirit manifestation, it means that as a person of Spirit faith, it gives the \u201cSpirit\u201d an entity and makes it manifest in the world.It is also possible to join hands with Annis, an advanced magic scientist. The faces of those who have shown their potential will be filled with surprises, and gradually joy will seep out.\u201cI wonder if there are many who have said that spiritual stones are the carcasses of spirits and have had anger and fear. I don\u2019t deny it either. But can we also overturn that theory by change? Don\u2019t you want to turn Spirit Stone into such recognition that it\u2019s not a carcass or something? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s what makes those who can\u2019t believe in the Spirit a signpost for those who can\u2019t get in touch with the Spirit and don\u2019t want to get through the Spirit?\u201cBy being able to handle magic, we can feel the benefits that we felt for the Spirit through our magic props\u2026!\u201cThere\u2019s no denying faith. It just changes the form of that prayer. Learn deeper, learn more, and turn into something better.\u201dFinally, they saw a future where they didn\u2019t have to fight the anisphere leading magic. And I didn\u2019t think I had to change the Spirit faith from the ground up or throw it away. This led above all to great peace of mind.No matter how much truth is revealed, it is not immediately possible to abandon the feelings and beliefs that have been cultivated. And they didn\u2019t even have to throw it away. Uphilia has shown us the way for those who want spiritual faith to join hands with magic.It is never necessary to contradict magic and the Anisphere, the leader of magic. I don\u2019t even have to bow my head for Kyoshu. However, we fill in each other\u2019s shortcomings and do what needs to be done in each other\u2019s territory. I realized that was possible.\u201cYou are the ones who have been recognized for their talent by knocking through the narrow gates. Now is the time to move on from the old lesson. I will guide you. And together we will build a new era.\u201d\u2013 Together, hands together.Words of wish without words create applause for 10,000 lightning. Everyone here had hope in their hearts. I was dreaming tomorrow. Seeing such a sight, Ufiria pulled her lips together satisfactorily and closed her eyes.On this day, a party receiving Kaoru pottery from Uphilia moved vigorously to such an extent that it did not think it was neutral that it had originally decided to be opportunistic.The forces of the Ministry of Magic, mainly Uphilia, will gradually increase in number. It\u2019s as if the thirsty earth sucks water and sprouts bright green.It didn\u2019t take that long until it created a new stream of times.\u201c\u2026 joint research? With me?\u201d\u201cYes, I would very much like to borrow the wisdom of Princess Anisphere, and I have set up this occasion\u201dI was asked to meet with people from the Ministry of Magic, including Marion, and they were telling me such a surprise story.I\u2019ve been in the office completely reserved for the Ministry of Defense more recently, but I blink my eyes at the face of the Ministry of Magic that I\u2019ve bothered to visit.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from Ufi\u2026?That\u2019s why I was confused. I haven\u2019t heard anything from Yufi about the offer from the Ministry of Magic. Although we live together out of the palace, we didn\u2019t even show such a bare gesture at all.\u2026 Yeah, but lately, Yufi and Raini may have had fun clouding their words. It was Yufi and Raini who had a lot of tough faces at first, but their expressions were softening to see if it was going well. Maybe he listened to the story itself because he seemed particularly enjoyable the other day.\u201cI talked to Princess Uphilia, but she said she would leave it to us to negotiate. We should also connect.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm, no Uffi?After rubbing during my last visit to the Ministry of Magic, I acted consciously to say that I was not interested in the Ministry.Sometimes I was too busy negotiating with blacksmiths and merchants to spread demon propaganda at the Ministry of Defense. However, I am often asked for an opinion, and the actual negotiations may be handled by the Knights of Sprout or Lord Grants.I also had to fly around to instruct people to actually use magic props, and honestly, I was usually busy and I didn\u2019t have time for the Ministry of Magic.So honestly, I don\u2019t really feel comfortable with being told I want to do collaborative research now, honestly.\u201cI do not expect you to be very comfortable with the attitude that the Ministry of Magic has taken towards Princess Anisphere until now. But if you think our joint research is worthwhile, we want to be shoulder to shoulder with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Marion, I also have a personal relationship with you. But I\u2019m also in a position to be involved in the spread of magic props right now. Even if you skip personal emotions, it\u2019s a little hard to snort. I\u2019d like to talk to you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dIf Marion takes the initiative and bows his head, the face of the Ministry of Magic will also continue to bow his head.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.That sincere attitude is unsettling. Until now I have been seen with mocking eyes or more feared than necessary, so I feel complicated when I can show this attitude.\u201cWhen it comes to collaborative research, what we want from Princess Anisphere is your opinion number. When we achieve results, we want to give them credit and advice.\u201d\u201cWhy bother with me? Speaking of Ministry of Magic research, I heard you\u2019ve been doing a full magic review lately.\u201dRecently, the Ufirian princess faction, mainly in Ufi, has expanded its forces in the Ministry of Magic. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that you are vibrant in the momentum to take in all the forces that were there, and essentially Uffi has the Ministry of Magic. When, I honestly thought.Or if you mean it, you\u2019re too scared, Yufi. I am graciously sweet and in a position as an advisor to the Ministry of Defense, but that is a position I have built with strength. I don\u2019t know where Uffi\u2019s extraordinary will stay. Scary.\u201cThat\u2019s Princess Uphilia taking the lead and pushing. We\u2019re in a different field, so we\u2019re only here to talk today.\u201d\u201cAnother field?\u201cYes, we are studying spiritual stones.\u201d\u201cHmm?I can\u2019t give an opinion on the magic itself, but when it becomes a spiritual stone, the story is a little different.\u201cWhat kind of research exactly?\u201cYes, Princess Anisphere is experiencing a phenomenon that corresponds to her attributes by being able to magic spiritual stones. That\u2019s where I focused my attention on the pseudo-magic of magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can take advantage of it, but do we need to give it that much importance?Spiritual stones can be fulfilled if they serve as a medium or amplifier to aid magic, like Yuffi\u2019s Arcane Shell, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bit of an area that the Ministry of Magic purposefully studies.That is certainly a study for me. But I don\u2019t see why the Ministry of Magic bothered to get its hands on that research. Not to mention, did you think to ask me for my opinion, my assessment, etc.\u201cHas Princess Anisphere already talked to Princess Uphilia about spiritual manifestations?\u201cI know the outline. It\u2019s the ideal Yuffi wants to live up to.\u201dI think the idea originated with the spirits who played the role of lights I saw at Llumiel\u2019s. That can be said to be the Spirit who used his affinity and communion with the Spirit as Spirit Contractor to give him a vessel called Light. Yuffi sets this as a magical extension line and hopes to accomplish it.That\u2019s what I actually heard from Uffi, too. How does that lead to the study of spiritual stones and why you want to involve me?\u201cSpirit manifestation is not just a phenomenon, but the goal is to get a higher dimensional shape ahead of it. In contrast, magic props make the phenomenon that magic causes unlimited simplicity and drop into the form of tools. I think that direction is the opposite.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cWith that in mind, our goal is the fusion of spirits and magic tools.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?Nature and voice went low. That was to hold back the feeling of being expensive on the table.There\u2019s a chill running down my spine. I feel like the edges of nature and lips lift.\u201cMagic is a string of truth, elucidation and academia. Demonic props are born through their unraveled mechanism. So I thought this would work for our Spirit Expression as well.\u201d\u201cHow do you use it effectively? Yeah, other than Marion would like an answer. I want to hear your thoughts, I do. I want you to actively wave your tongue in turn or by raising your hand. Ilia, serve them tea again!If I skip the instructions, Ilaria, who had refrained as her secretary, starts preparing new tea.I turn to Marion and the others as I try to get myself on board, making sure Ilia\u2019s prep has begun.\u201cWhen I conducted a magical review at the head of Princess Uphilia, I thought: Magic can be complicated everywhere. But just because you can use magic doesn\u2019t mean everyone can use magic with the same feeling. It makes a personal difference.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. So?\u201d\u201cI wondered if the magic artifacts created by magic could hold back the\u201c murmur \u201dcreated by this individual difference.\u201d\u201cDo you have to get rid of that\u201c murky \u201dthing?\u201cYes, I think so\u201dA middle-aged nobleman sitting next to Marion nods strongly, with a tight look.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the wrong way of thinking. So I want to\u201c process \u201dthe Spirit Stone in order to study the Spirit Stone at the core of the Magic Prop and create a Magic Prop to match it. Is that why you want my opinion?\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cI see. I can\u2019t use magic. I think it\u2019s a great study from me. Am I complacent to think that magical ideas incorporate the idea of magic?\u201cThis is also a gift of incense pottery by Princess Uphilia. Princess Uphilia is corrupt in reviewing the foundations of magic and creating the foundations for further pursuits, but our goal is to improve the foundations of magic that can be handled as a whole. I want to create that aid.\u201dSo far, Yufi has taken the lead in studying what the Ministry of Magic can only pursue as \u201cmagic\u201d. On the other hand, what Marion and the others, who have hoped to meet today, want is to reform the very foundations of magic.In other words, rather than magic itself, it can be described as a research team for magic, which develops magical props like Uffi\u2019s Arcane Shell. I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s the flow that I was asked for as your opinion number.\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with spiritual stones as\u201c nuclei \u201dand\u201c power sources, 'so I don\u2019t know how powerful they can be when they\u2019re\u201d processed \u201dinto boulders?\u201cYes, that\u2019s okay. We take the usual research lead, and you can only give the Princess Anisphere an assessment or opinion. I wonder if that would bother you that much. And I was wondering if I could offer you something in return.\u201d\u201c\u2026 in return?\u201cYes, if you can produce magic props for magic, on the contrary, I think you can produce spiritual stones for magic props.\u201dOut of the way, my heart jumped\u2026. Oh, that\u2019s too much of a killer for me.\u201cWhat if you were able to accommodate spirits in a core spiritual stone, such as a spiritual aid to the magic of magic props? We think we can study magic like that.\u201d\u201cIs that part of your research?\u201cIt\u2019s not the subject matter, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s possible to come into being as a by-product?If a spirit born of magic is established as a technique, as a magic prop was born from magic.And the future they aspired to before those two merged was portrayed in them.\u201cDon\u2019t you think spiritual stones can bring magic to new frontiers, not just as nuclei or power, but as nuclei that host spirits\u201c if they can be re-tailored \u201c? Princess Anisphere. Until now, we have come from mutual certainty. I want you to see the challenge of overcoming that past. To you, nothing else.\u201dMarion comes with his hand as he stands for. My gaze gathers to me. It\u2019s just a hot gaze to say you won\u2019t miss even a little physical movement.\u201c\u2026 really come on, the Ministry of Magic doesn\u2019t care if you clap back or say good things with your mouth, you don\u2019t know how serious you are. I can\u2019t trust you. I won\u2019t let you forget what you did to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cI still wanted to believe it. If you can hold hands together, if you acknowledge my magic and seek me out\u2026. then I can\u2019t say no.\u201dI laugh a little bitterly myself, but I\u2019m not going to be able to hide how happy I am.I also put my hand on the hand Marion offered and shook hands tightly. The strength of the gripped hands seemed to overwhelm what would come in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: 69\u201cIsn\u2019t this the tide, ladies and gentlemen?\u201dIt was Miguel Graphite who cut the story out. He smiles, as usual, and looks to those sitting in front of him.One of them, Lang Voltaire, stares at Miguel as he makes a toothpick noise. But there is no movement to follow.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t feel sorry for you either. But if you say you deserve it, you can\u2019t deny it. Now we can pull ourselves back without compromising that glory. If the princesses would back off, they wouldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so stand aside at the top of the current Ministry of Magic,\u201dMiguel was collecting the upper echelons of the Ministry of Magic, part of it, to advise.The contents are that the executive officers of the Ministry of Magic voluntarily retire and have them succeed to the next generation. Whatever the youngsters are still comparatively, even with the advice from Miguel, the expression of those who want to hang on to the old man is bleak.Anisphere is not involved in this matter. Miguel had spoken to Uphilia to match his movements, but Miguel was leading the effort against the upper echelons of the Ministry of Magic.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s with the executive officers on the princesses\u2019 faction. Some remain, but only to take over, and there is no reason why they can remain executive officers. After you retire, you can leave a title for your opinion number. I don\u2019t think this is going to get any worse, do you?The executives, who could once be described as spiritual faithful, could be described as mainstream in the Ministry of Magic. But they lost power once and for all when the truth of the Spirit covenant was revealed.And all of the young people in the Ministry of Magic are devoting their hearts and minds to research and development, which should be called \u201cmagic of a new era\u201d, which incorporates the magic promoted by the princesses.At the earliest possible moment, even in the Ministry of Magic, they are losing their voice and position. Or so, there was no way I could just crack that open. That\u2019s all the truth about the spiritual covenant was a fatal fact for them.\u201cThat\u2019s it for my help ship, too, if you want to see blood. Those princesses don\u2019t want blood to flow, but they\u2019re not sweet enough to miss the disturbing elements that threaten their country.\u201d\u201cDisturbers\u2026 are we threatening the country?\u201d\u201cAt least for the country the princesses make, though. You\u2019re not denying everything about spiritual faith, are you? But if the Spirit insists that a nation can be unified, what is it for?\u201dShin, the place calms down. Miguel flaunts his shoulder as he sees the reaction.The Spirit Contractor says that his soul is replaced by the Great Spirit. In other words, I have found that those who were ever considered great are not men.The closer you get to the Spirit in the Spirit faith, the more you lose yourself as a person. I was wondering if it would still be required. Miguel believes it will take time to ask that and come up with an answer. That\u2019s why I was wondering if this is the place to go.\u201cI really feel sorry for you. Nothing is evil that I have believed in that faith. If the times were the times, the idea might have saved the country. I just didn\u2019t get around to the times. Isn\u2019t that all we\u2019re talking about?\u201d\u201c\u2026 the young making of graphites. It\u2019s a mouth that goes around a lot.\u201d\u201cIf you have a problem that you can solve with words, you should exchange words. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve been doing to Princess Anisphere? Did she ever use her power to sue you?To Miguel\u2019s word, once again, the directors of the Ministry of Magic shut up. Anisphere, who just repeated unscrupulous and ruinous things. She did insist on rampant arguments. But it is subjective to them, and Anisphere has never appealed to the shield of power.I was never willing to try to hurt you, even if I ever wavered my power as a princess. That was what many people thought when they looked back. That princess has always stood up to me with words.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, don\u2019t believe me, and you\u2019ll have to do it yourself later. That\u2019s all I can do, and if it\u2019s detrimental to the national interest, I\u2019ll go that way. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to say hello.\u201d\u201c\u2026 there is nothing unexpected about the truth of our spiritual covenant.\u201dOne of the directors of the Ministry of Magic squeals at Miguel, who was about to take a seat.If Miguel looks at him with his gaze, he\u2019s holding his fist with the look of simmering bitterness.\u201cStill, even if all of a sudden they say it is\u2026 I can\u2019t change it\u201dNothing answered the grunt, and Miguel turned his back and left the room.\u201cAre we done discussing this?\u201cOh, Marion.\u201dMiguel, who was walking down the hallway of the Ministry of Magic, raises one hand when he notices Marion standing there waiting.\u201cI\u2019m done discussing this with the great ones. Well, there\u2019s nothing more you can do.\u201d\u201cReally? \u2026 is this going to work?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just true that the truth of the Spirit covenant has created a great wind hole in the Spirit faith. Most old folks seem to have broken their core. Princess Anisphere stabbed Todome with it.\u201dIt was a while ago. Anisphere lost her word in the Ministry of Magic and was embarrassed by Uphilia.It is true that that Anispheric silence shook up the Ministry of Magic. That led to a change in the whole Ministry of Magic, for better or worse.Uphilia took in those who could cope with the potential changes and feathered heavily as her own faction. On the other hand, it was also true that many were stopped by the truth of the Spirit Faith and the fierceness of the Anisphere.\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to let the outbursts break and say no to your worries, but Princess Anisphere wants it.\u201d\u201cPreserving it as a culture is not evil, you just can\u2019t let it stand as a political initiative. That\u2019s what he said.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of a remedy to someone who doesn\u2019t fit me against is the vessel wide, gentle, sweet\u2026\u201dThat is left to the recipient. With that in mind, Miguel thought that Anisphere was certainly not for the king.You can do it if you say you can do the king. But it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for you. In that regard, it must have turned out well that Uphilia had named her.Miguel thought that Anisphere was not suitable for the king, but that he might be ideal as the king\u2019s understander, and laughed as he throated.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Graphite family at the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if the restructuring comes together, maybe it will\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an array before that.\u201dNow that I know what Miguel\u2019s mouthed \u201carr\u201d indicates, Marion loosened the look she was tightening.\u201cYeah, it won\u2019t be long.\u201d\u201cThank you all for your hard work in getting ready. Is your fianc\u00e9e busy, too?\u201cIs it Halfis? Princess Uphilia immediately took it as her assistant. It seems busy, but it\u2019s plentiful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than anything.\u201dMiguel also loosened his expression when he saw Marion speak happily.Some can\u2019t change, others can adapt to change. All those who were able to live the times of transformation of this era seemed glorious.He\u2019s the one who said, \u201cLook at you.\u201dMiguel shrugged pompously as he held his hand to block the light of the day as it plugged through the window.The \u201cfestival\u201d soon approached. Like looking forward to it, Miguel grinned like a bad boy.The \u201cfestival\u201d was approaching the Kingdom of Palletia.At the beginning of this festival, it was finally reported to the nation that Uphilia was welcomed by the royal family as an adopted son and officially granted the right to inherit the throne.As a celebration, the festival was celebrated by naming the country. It was because Anisphere and Uphilia, respectively, proposed to Orphans that they once again spread to the public the announcement of the mutual achievements they had built in the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Magic.Orphans approved the proposal in the name of the king, and people were running around to make it a big festival to name the country.\u201c\u2026 that?\u201cDear Anisphere? What have you done?I don\u2019t even care about Ilia\u2019s call, and I now look back at the paperwork I\u2019ve finished looking through. This is the last of the unread documents. On the other side of the unread document is a stack of processed documents.Nothing is a strange sight. Yet I alternate between unprocessed paperwork and empty unprocessed paperwork compartments over and over again without realizing it.\u201c\u2026 today\u2019s paperwork, that\u2019s it?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the last of it.\u201d\u201cUh, but\u2026 over?\u201cEnd of story\u2026\u2026 even if something\u2019s wrong?\u201c\u2026 no, no, but\u201dI\u2019ve finished processing today\u2019s paperwork. That, if always, could be said to be a division of work. But today was special.I move the last of the paperwork into a processed bin and leave myself behind in the back of the chair. Though I feel tired, it was above all a lack of realism that occupies my chest.\u201c\u2026 tomorrow, right?\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow. It\u2019s a celebration of Ufiria\u2019s adoption and royalty, and it\u2019s the day when the Defense and Magic Ministries will release their studies related to magic to the public.\u201d\u201cYes, right?\u2026 Hey, Ilia? Are you sure this is the last time? You didn\u2019t report any deficiencies or anything?\u201c\u2026 what are you so anxious about\u201dIlia told me like I was scared. No, I mean, I\u2019m anxious, I just don\u2019t feel it.\u201cPlus the paperwork will be ready for tomorrow even after it\u2019s done. I will return to the palace for final confirmation tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. Okay.\u201dNot only did I look through the paperwork until today, but I was flying around and living a remarkable day out of instruction on how to use magic props. That now marks the separation of tomorrow\u2019s festivities.I knew I didn\u2019t feel it. I\u2019m anxious, I\u2019m about to look back to see if I missed anything.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anisphere\u201d\u201cHuh? What, Ilia\u201dMy hand has reached out where I tried to look back on Ilia\u2019s call. Ilia hugs me so I can hold her from behind. I round my eyes to the sudden action of Ilia.Ilia weighs in to keep her face in the back of my head. Stronger to such an extent that the strength of the arms you cuddle is not painful.\u201c\u2026 until today, really, really good job\u201d\u2026 seemed to fill an empty hole in my chest. The sense of reality that I didn\u2019t feel fills me up at once.Today, I welcomed a separation. It doesn\u2019t just mean getting ready for tomorrow\u2019s festival. Tomorrow will be a special day for me too.\u2018Cause it\u2019s the day to officially announce magic to the people and the achievements of magic. I kept going to get to this day.It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want it. But reality wasn\u2019t nice enough for me to dream. Abused, repelled, feared. I couldn\u2019t give up dreaming even though I was pulling away from the palace.\u201c\u2026 haha. Ilia\u2019s a mess. We\u2019re just ready, aren\u2019t we?\u201cYes. Still, you arrived. Everything you\u2019ve been building up is waiting for you tomorrow.\u201dIlia says as she whispers in her ear. The voice slips into my ear with a very gentle voice color.\u201cYou can\u2019t help but be anxious. Because you are no longer the only one who dreams of Anisphere. There will be many that have left their hands. But isn\u2019t that the world you aspired to?\u201c\u2026 Sure, I thought it would be nice to spread. There\u2019s my magic in the world. I couldn\u2019t give you magic, that\u2019s why I was able to produce magic.\u201dNow that I think about it, my beginnings came from both the extremes of hope and despair.The supreme hope that there is magic and the greatest despair that its magic could not give me.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I couldn\u2019t give up because the hope lay within my reach. I never had time to cry in despair. I just want it, I want it, I keep asking for it.But it seems to me that as far away from the form I sought as I sought. I wanted to be able to use magic. I wanted to be because I wanted to magically make someone smile.Maybe I had given up within no one understood me. But if you give up on that, you lose the point of being me, too.That\u2019s not why I was afraid. I can\u2019t help losing it. It was just that the giving up that there was nothing I could do was slowly killing me.\u201cLiving has been so hard. Ilia.\u201d\u201cYes, if you put your foot on the ground, it feels weighty even if you don\u2019t like it\u201dI\u2019m not even a bird.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was weird whenever you flew. No, you must have been flying. Even with the stopping trees, you lost sight of where you were going, but you kept flying.\u201dIlia hugs me so hard that I lean on her. Its warmth is terribly warm, with my hands on my arms to hold.\u201cNow I can say it with my chest up, too. This is where you come from.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what you built. It is a dream, a wish and a miracle that we all received. That would be no less than the feat of the first king. And I would like to congratulate you from the bottom of your heart on the place you wish to be.\u201dMine, where.Ilia let me go softly. I leave the office in a dream.Through the hallway leading out of the office and out. The sun sets and the sky is stained bright red.I burn the royal castle lit that day, the castle town, and its sky and horizon in my eyes.\u201c\u2026 here\u2019s mine\u201dIt\u2019s where I am. The whining words in my mouth stain my chest.One step, I look back toward Ilia, who came with me trying to be late.What would I look like now? A little, that\u2019s all I cared about.\u201cLet\u2019s go home, Ilia\u201d\u201cYes, Master Anisphere\u201d\u201cI\u2019m back now\u201d\u201cWelcome back, Uffi, Raini\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m home!It was me and Ilia who came back out of the palace first. Yufi and Raini came home after a little delay.\u201cAre you done over there?\u201cYep. Don\u2019t be unprepared tomorrow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been tough until today.\u201dRaini groans emotionally. Indeed, it was us who were on the run to prepare to this day. It really makes me feel emotional.In the meantime, there was some trouble that wasn\u2019t small, but if you think you\u2019re going to welcome tomorrow, you don\u2019t even have to turn your mind to what\u2019s over. The important thing is that it\u2019s tomorrow.\u201cRaini, I just got back, can you help me?\u201cOh, yes! Dear Ilia, I\u2019ll be there in a minute!Patapata and Raini rush down to Ilia, where they were preparing meals in the kitchen.If you drop Raini off his back, it\u2019s me and Uffi who will be left behind. If we look at each other, we\u2019re kind of crazy and laughing at each other.\u201c\u2026 Is it tomorrow already? Sounds early to me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of days and a lot of things.\u201d\u201cYep\u2026. If I had been myself a while ago, I wouldn\u2019t have believed that I was a princess.\u201d\u201cNeither do I. I\u2019m sure you couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dI reach out and hold Yuffi\u2019s hand. Yuffi looks at me just a little strange when he gets his hand gripped.With such a peek into Yufi\u2019s eyes, I smile and make her look hazy.\u201cHe said there\u2019s a Uffi next to me. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so is that\u201d\u201cThings have changed.\u201d\u201cYes, me, you, this country.\u201d\u201cTomorrow, that\u2019s the point of arrival\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s a crossing point, isn\u2019t it?Uffi tangled his fingers at me, pulling himself just a little closer and turning his hand around his hips.I fit in Yuffi\u2019s hand. This is how I got used to being natural.\u201cIt\u2019s over, it starts.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do our best, Uffi\u201d\u201cYes, Anis\u201dYuffi smiles and tries to lip me. I try to let my fingers break in and push Yuffi\u2019s lips as they approach me.Then Yuffi\u2019s eyebrows distorted in dissatisfaction. And with just a little strangeness to it, I lay my hand on Yuffi\u2019s cheek and hold her finger against my ear.Drop a kiss that just touches you so you don\u2019t gain too much momentum as it is\u2026. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t fail, stroking my chest down. I can\u2019t get used to all this.Yuffi\u2019s eyes open in circles\u2026. Well, it\u2019s unusual to do it from me, or only about when I\u2019m loved.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m hungry\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. Ilia and Raini will prepare the rice now\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dGu, and Yufi hold my body. Uffi\u2019s eyes are sitting somewhere sighted at a distance where he is likely to exhale\u2026. Shit, could it have stirred up too much.\u201c\u2026 on an equal footing. I have to eat, and I have tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201dI can clearly see the heat where it was touched. I closed my eyes to the comfort of that fever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70: 70On that day, it is told that the Kingdom of Palletia has shown the busiest of all time.Adoption into the royal family of the Duke and Duke of Ufilia Magenta, to whom I had made prior contact. The renaming, making her the second princess of Uphilia Fez Palettia, and the holding of the festival giving her the right to inherit the throne was well known.To celebrate the country, the whole country was vibrant. It was the flying magic props entrusted to the Ministry of Defense from Anisphere and to each Knights that helped that vibrancy.The lessons learned from the prototypes so far, the flying magic equipment, where mass production was officially decided, also involving civilian technicians, were close to what Anisphere called a \u201cmotorcycle\u201d in his memory of his previous life.I think about everything from materials to wages for mass production, and only assume that one person will ride. Still, bike-type flying magic props can deliver voices everywhere faster than ever before.The name will also be \u201cAir Bike\u201d picked up from Anispheric whining, and the Knights will be welcomed with their hands up.With stronger ties everywhere, new ideas incorporating the idea of magic were also taking root in the Ministry of Magic. It was so innovative that it was whispered that it might renew existing education.The discipline that would later be called \u201cmagic\u201d was an opportunity for Uphilia, who became the second princess, to take the lead in reviewing existing magic and developing a clearer understanding of magic.Beside it was supposedly accompanied by a Viscount\u2019s Lady. It is a little further that she takes the tabular stage of history.As the spread of magic props by the Ministry of Defense spreads, it will also attract many surprises that the Ministry of Magic has begun joint research on magic props in line with its steps.Until now, the magic props that Anisphere \u201ccould not use\u201d were undergoing further transformation as a result of the Wizard\u2019s cooperation in active development.Thus the world that Anisphere wanted and dreamed of. One end of it was about to be opened on this day.The castle town was full of vibrant voices.Countless stalls lined the castle town with lively decorations, amazing the visitors.Whatever, the stalls were supplied with magic props to help them live. A pot that uses, for example, the Spirit Stone of Fire to warm water without putting out a fire. Conversely, it was all eye-catching, such as demonic props that used water and wind spirit stones to produce ice.\u201cThis is just magic without the need for fire. The water will boil! From your usual routine to helping you with your journey!\u201cThis one is a magic tool that can produce ice even when it\u2019s hot! Come closer and look!In organizing a festival for the propagation of magic props, Anisphere asked the inhabitants of the castle town to cooperate. In other words, it is over-the-counter advertising. They actually use magic props to appeal to their convenience. The inhabitants of Castle Town, who were familiar with Anisphere, took it upon themselves with pleasure.Those who use magic props to get out of the stalls attracted the interest of those who came from afar, such as new products inspired by Anisphere, from those who made the original products more sophisticated.For the record, Anisphere sees a castle town that has been set up and thinks it\u2019s like an edge date.\u201cOh, there\u2019s really hot water coming out without a fire! That\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s ice!? What can you give me if I don\u2019t ask the nobleman? It\u2019s a dream story to be able to put this at home!\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten this before! It\u2019s like a fluffy cloud!\u201cHa-ha-ha! That\u2019s a cloud of candy conceived by Princess Anisphere! How about that, it\u2019ll taste good!\u201cThis is candy!? Wow! Mother, look, this is candy!Everyone is showing surprise and joy. If Anisphere wanted to spread this magic artifact to the country, everyone would expect a future in which this convenient artifact could be freely used.It\u2019s not just the stalls that are busy. The large square of the castle town, at which the venue was held again, was different from the stalls.\u201cUntil now, civilians have had no connection to magic! But not with this demon prop! With magic, this Mana Blade turns fast into a sword! But the only normal weight is the sword pattern, which even women and children can carry! It can be used as a protective weapon!\u201cWhen it comes to swords, I know some associate fighting, but I want you to think about it! As you can see, Mana Blade can adjust the shape. Its uses vary!There was a demonic prop experience going on there. It was mainly Mana Blade who was on display. Not only men, but women and children also have Mana Blade in their hands to produce a blade of magic to show the color of excitement.That would be the case, too. Until now, magic was a privilege of nobility. Even though it is limited, it can cause a magical phenomenon simply by holding it in your hand. Many, even those who do not make rough things their livelihood, reach for their novelty.\u201cDude, is that Mana Blade finally going to be put up for sale!?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted it, that\u2026! How much you wanted as a spare weapon!Among them, the joyful voices were those who made adventurers their business.Having had adventures with the Anisphere, they inflate their hopes for the possibility that Mana Blade, the symbolic weapon of the Anisphere, could be sold.\u201cHey, we\u2019re doing a Mana Blade demonstration over there! The demonstrator said even that Baron Cyan!\u201cSeriously!? Adventurers made me roar with\u201c proud arms, \u201cyou know!?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a stick on an august, like a demon prop on an august arm! Let\u2019s go check it out!It was Baron Cyan who stood as a demonstrator of Mana Blade\u2019s performance as he drew the crowd\u2019s attention. At the request of Anisphere, he had undertaken this role to show Mana Blade\u2019s performance himself.Before Baron Cyan, a large rock magically installs three times as likely as a person. Confirming that a boulder has been installed, Baron Cyan places Mana Blade on the upper level.\u201c\u2026 oh, wow!!\u201dMana Blade creates a blade of magic as she growls in the mood of tearing. Even once a namesake adventurer, he is formerly a civilian. The sight aroused excitement from those who knew him as an adventurer.A blade is formed that is likely to be as tall as a person. Its gigantic magic blade is shaken down by a thick arm that must be an alias for an auspicious arm. The blade swung down with all the steps that rock the ground eats into the boulder.\u201cCheryaaaaaaa!!\u201dGun. Baron Cyan can help push the blade eaten into the boulder. The boulder is splendidly amputated and made into two pieces so that it falls to the left and right.After the boulder falls, the cheer boils after a moment of silence. As he is wrapped up in that cheer, Baron Cyan shows Mana Blade up. The cheer swelled up like it exploded even more.Then the experience of actually using Mana Blade to slash rocks begins. Baron Cyan, who saw the sight of everyone taking Mana Blade in their hands in fear or in exasperation, narrowed his eyes and quietly beckoned toward the royal castle.\u201cBrilliant buzz, Grants boy\u201d\u201cYep. Right, Lord Lumi.\u201dLlumiel shrugged as he looked down at the bustling castle town from the royal castle. By its side, Grants refrains. Llumiel stares delightfully at the crowd\u2019s buzz as she narrows her eyes.Grants standing next to it is upright immovable. There was no change in expression, just the same view as Llumiel.\u201cAre you glad you didn\u2019t go?\u201cThere are also commanders whose sire and queen are absent.\u201d\u201c\u2026 even though it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s sunny stage\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your daughter anymore\u201dGrants breaks his expression only slightly to Llumiel\u2019s question. Close your eyes and stare at the distance. Its mouth is smiling thinly.\u201cThat\u2019s good. At least for us. Now she had big wings. What more can I want to see you off?\u201d\u201c\u2026 a man without greed\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already had enough happiness in my hands.\u201dTwo, Llumiel shifts his gaze. There Nerschel was slowly walking over.Nerschel gives Llumiel a compliment as he is, standing next to Grants and intertwining his arms with Grants.\u201cLook. Lord Lumi, our blood and those who inherit your blood.\u201dLlumiel turns his gaze under his eyes as Grants urges. It is a beautifully decorated carriage departing from the castle gate of the royal castle.Orphans and Silfines are on the carriage ahead, and Anisphere and Uphilia are on the carriage that follows. As the carriage walks, it continues as the Knights escort them.It\u2019s a royal parade march. Llumiel stared at them as they toured the castle and blurred their sight.\u201cIt\u2019s Princess Uphilia!\u201cPrincess Anisphere is with us!\u201cLong live His Majesty the King!\u201cAnis, you look beautiful!The people lined up to see the royal parade march. Anispheres are smiling and waving on the carriage.Everyone was laughing, having fun and inflating their breasts with expectations for tomorrow. Both the children\u2019s bright voices and the adults\u2019 cheerful voices are loud, and the festival is just not to be said to be a huge feast.Llumiel, who was picking up the sound through the Spirit of the Wind, accidentally turns his gaze to the sky. It\u2019s a sunny, good day without a cloud. Llumiel shrugs as he closes his eyes to the dazzling sunlight.\u201c\u2026 have you seen this sight somewhere, Father? Your wish is still breathing here. Are you watching this? Hey\u2026\u2026\u201dCall me by the name of someone small, really small to whine about.Llumiel flushed a small Shizuku out of his eyes.Yeah, it\u2019s not harder than I thought! The pasted smile is going to cramp and collapse!I\u2019ve never seen a royal parade in my face, and, look, even if they say it\u2019s good to just smile and wave, I still mean butt in when there are so many people, or that it\u2019s embarrassing to be seen in a dress dressed by someone in a familiar castle town\u2026If you hadn\u2019t held my hand where I couldn\u2019t see Uffi along the way, my smile would have broken. After managing to finish the nervous parade, Yuffi was officially welcomed by the royal adopted son as it was, and announced in the square to address the people that she had become the second princess.In the meantime I didn\u2019t talk about anything either, I was just smiling and congratulating Yufi. When Yufi officially becomes a princess, the loud cheer when it is well known in front of the people comes with terrible damage to the eardrum. Maybe we should have earplugs this time\u2026\u2026\u201cI want everyone to have a lot of fun today! Furthermore, after this, there has been some entertainment by Anisphere and Uphilia. Please celebrate the good day!!\u201dWhoa, my father mentioned the \u201ceyeballs\u201d of the day. I gave a deep thank you and now the parade march begins to return to the royal castle.I manage to keep my smile and keep waving while I return to the royal castle. At the same time as returning to the royal castle, me and Uffi are stripped of their dresses so that they can be taken by the samurai.\u201cI will call you back!\u201cYeah, please.\u201dAll we have to do is have this aftermath of \u201ceyeballs\u201d. But this pastime was the real deal for us.She is stripped off of her princely dress, which is difficult to move, and dressed in new clothes even as she is reapplied with makeup. It\u2019s a costume tailored to Uffi and me for this day.Based on knight\u2019s clothing, this outfit is impeccably embroidered as a princess. It is a dress that is woven with a good place for knightly clothing. Similar everyday clothes are tailored by me personally, but what I\u2019m dressed for now is a courtesy version of this, which is very luxurious.\u201cIsn\u2019t it painful?\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201dIlia, who was leading my change of clothes, will take the confirmation. I try to jump a few times, try to move my body, but it is not difficult to move.If the costume isn\u2019t a problem, now it\u2019s a makeup finish. My hair was neatly done and shown in the mirror. I was brilliantly polished. I feel more and more in the mood today at all times. I\u2019ve changed my clothes twice, so they should be busy enough.\u201cAnis.\u201dSpeak up and look back. There was Uffi with Raini and Halfis.Raini, who is becoming completely exclusive to Uffi these days, and Halfis, who was served as Uffi\u2019s secretary. I am still here today because I want to do the work of a samurai.Yuffi\u2019s outfit is a different outfit than mine. I don\u2019t know what to say, but is it the desire I fell in love with that makes me fall in love a little bit? I\u2019m a little thrilled.\u201cUffi, you look great.\u201d\u201cAnd Anis. She\u2019s cute.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I wanted you to say you look a little good there. Yufi looks good.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cMaster Anis is adorable.\u201d\u201c\u2026 following? Is that what you\u2019re following, Raini?\u201chahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfis is laughing like trouble, so I decided to settle the pursuit spear for now. I\u2019ve been pushing for a little while. I\u2019m busy today, so I don\u2019t have time to waste.\u201cShall we move then? Are you ready for Tomas and the others?\u201cThey say it\u2019s not a problem. The final adjustment will be on the ground after you two are in place!It was Halfis who answered my query. I listen to the response and nod and show it.\u201cOkay. Yufi, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, Anis\u201dTake the samurai, we\u2019ll move the royal castle. The nobles were rushing around where we headed. Find Tomas there, and I\u2019ll exchange greetings.\u201c\u2026 are you here,\u2026 hon. Good day, Princess Anisphere, Princess Uphilia\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing hard about it, Chief Ghana!Thomas, who is neat and tidy, is still not comfortable with his awe-inspiring attitude, choosing words somewhere else.As I laughed at Tomas\u2019 unfamiliar appearance, I was dropped to say if Tomas\u2019 eyebrows were still this.\u201c\u2026 Give me a break. More than that, time is running out, so get ready.\u201d\u201cOkay. Tomas, please.\u201d\u201cOh, I got it.\u201dTomas nods and answers and shows. And what Tomas offered me was a coat that assumed to weave feathers over the courtesy. It has a long hem and swings to momentum when the feathers are woven.This coat is characterized by a stitched spiritual stone on the hem and back. This coat is also the collection in this \u201ceyeball\u201d.\u201cFinal confirmation, how\u2019s the magic street?\u201c\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s no problem. The flow path is just perfect.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026. Is Master Uphilia okay too?\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t have a problem either\u201dUphilia also weaves a coat on top of her courtesy that is slightly different in shape from mine. Fewer ornaments than my coat. But embroidered like a beautiful tattoo, it\u2019s no less flashy than me, which can be said to have too many ornaments.\u201c\u2026 nervous, you will\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m excited.\u201d\u201cI have a little trauma.\u201d\u201c\u2026 about that, look, I\u2019m sorry\u201dWhen Yufi smiles and shows him the groaning, he turns into a bitter laugh when he is reminded of the flattery of himself he feels.Uffi offered me a hand like that. I lay my own hand over Yuffi\u2019s hand and tangled my fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke\u2026. Come on, let\u2019s go\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go\u201dWe head to the roof of the royal castle. There the faces of Lord Grants, Mrs. Nerschel and Llumiel were seen.Many others also gather under the royal castle and in the castle town square that leads from it. The attention is on time. It is also as planned to make a call that the afterlife will begin.I was nervous. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the most nervous thing I\u2019ve ever lived. But as much as that, no, as much as I surpassed it, I was booming my expectations.\u201cIt\u2019s time! Princess Anisphere, Princess Uphilia! Please!Halfis raises his voice full of expectations. I let go of my fingers that were connected to Uffi and put my foot on the edge of the roof.\u201c\u2026 once again, thank all the people who have helped us so far today\u201dThe time I\u2019ve piled up on my own brought me this far with the good fortune of someone taking my hand.So I want to show you. Dreams I wanted, to everyone. Here\u2019s the \u201cwing\u201d I got for it.Pull out the celestial that was lowering to your hips, put it in the front and close your eyes. Concentrate your consciousness and let the magic pass.The magic flows around the celestial, as does the coat where the feathers were woven. The magic that flows through your whole body recognizes your coat like a part of you.Spirit stones embedded in every part of the coat react to and inspire my magic. Its center, the decoration on the back of the coat, sucks up my magic.(Magic fill, done. Magic flow path, stable)The spiritual stone embedded with this back decoration is not just a spiritual stone. A product born of the Ministry of Magic\u2019s pursuit of the study of spiritual stones, it obtained the characteristic of having a connection in conjunction with homogeneous spiritual stones.However, it is a luxury that the magic of the user must be registered in order to use it, and it is terribly costly.Furthermore, from the yarn stage, the coat is finely scraped with its special spiritual stone and mixed with fiber. That\u2019s why I can pass magic through my coat like it\u2019s on an extension line of flesh.I\u2019ve always had dreams. I had the first dream of admiring magic.Magic to make someone smile, that\u2019s the \u201cfirst magic\u201d I ever admired.Reach for your free hand. Spread your hand into the sky so as to grip the sky.\u201c\u2026 Yikes!!\u201dTrying to regain my temper, I threw myself straight into the universe with my strength on the foot I was putting on the edge of the roof.\u201c\u201d Fly. \u201cYeah, yeah!!\u201dIn response to my voice, the \u201cmagic\u201d that was hidden in my coat unfolded.\u201cWings\u201d opened.On the back of Anisphere, who threw herself into the universe from the rooftop of the royal castle, the feathers of light of colour spread reminiscent of the sky. It buoyed the body of the falling anisphere and pushed it up into the sky.Those who watched up close for a moment scream, but take away their gaze to be taken aback by the Anisphere, who rose to the sky.Some people saw the sight of flying in the sky several times with strange magic props, but they were still blinded. The way you danced freely in the sky, in a nutshell, because it was beautiful.Anisphere looks back as she twirls around in the air. What the retrospective Anisphere saw was the appearance of the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d flying in pursuit.\u201cUfi!\u201d\u201cAnis!\u201dIt is the rainbow feather that spreads on Uphilia\u2019s back against the empty wings of Anisphere. Anisphere thinks of the feathers as \u201cfairies\u201d from previous memories.Empty wings and two capturing the wind with rainbow feathers cross hands like high touches dancing in the air. We keep grinning at each other and then flying to plunder over the castle town.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201cYeah, everywhere\u201dCome on, shall we start the \u201cpastime\u201d?Magically flying through the sky, the crystal of our dreams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So the sky was nobody\u2019s.Until that day. The sky that day was certainly just for them.The blue winged anisphere accelerates. Follow the leading Uphilia as she swoops the hem of her coat.Uphilia, who was flying like he was dancing ahead of the Anisphere, turns direction and faces the Anisphere.Celestial held in Anisphere\u2019s hand is waved down. The arcane shell of Uphilia\u2019s hand receives and crosses to intercept.The moment of intersection flies around the air for a moment, taking a distance to bounce off each other and drawing circles.\u201c\u201d Air cutter \u201c\u201dUphilia waves the arcane shell as she widens her rainbow feathers wide and rises altitude to take the Anisphere overhead. The blade of the wind approaches Anisphere as it glimpses through the sword flashes painted by Arcanshell.Anisphere turns back and dodges the impending wind blade, then turns back in the air to Uphilia.Uphilia keeps rolling out air cutters for the looming anisphere. The anisphere changes course at a steep angle so as to escape the rays of the countless air cutters produced.Uphilia, who was stagnant at a time when Anisphere radically changed course, also moves out. Now loosen your buoyancy and increase your speed towards the ground at once.(Huh, still can\u2019t beat Anis at pure speed\u2026\u2026!Falling and increasing velocity, Ufiria frowns. At first glance, that\u2019s different if you think you\u2019re flying with the same gear, the same conditions.The flight of Uphilia is only assisted by magic props, realizing the \u201cmagic for flight\u201d knitted by Uphilia on the axis. The main thing is to gain buoyancy.So if you are going to use magic apart from flying magic, there are limits to the magic that can be activated at the same time. If it becomes massive magic, I can\u2019t keep up with my thoughts. Shooting magic while moving can only be combined with simple magic, even in Uphilia.\u201cLet them get away with it!!\u201dIn contrast, Anisphere was flying entirely of demonic props only. Anispheric flights are carried out by the Spirit Stone, which incorporates the magic of flight assembled by Uphilia.The difference between these two is trivial, but very different. Whereas the flight of Uphilia is magically controlled, the flight of Anisphere is controlled by magic props.When it comes to what the difference makes, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s easy to understand the moment of intersection between the two of them.\u201cHa!\u201d\u201cHoly shit!slack the orbit as the Ufirian arcane shell recieves into the anisphere that swings down the celestial to shake it wide.Keep making sure Uphilia grabs Anisphere\u2019s arm and slips through. Plus it kicks Anisphere in the back.Annisphere, kicked out by Uphilia, goes straight to the ground. Return your posture to do a forward rotation in the universe and land your feet on the roof of an impending building.(Oh, no more! I can avoid it! If it\u2019s freedom of control, you can\u2019t beat a magic control formula!Anisphere kicks the ground again and rises to the sky. If you look around you, you can see it prominently, but Anisphere flights often depict a linear orbit. I mean, \u201cfly straight\u201d a lot.In contrast, Uphilia has a lot of movement like drawing curves. This was the difference between flight by spindle and magic by spindle by magic props.Anisphere at speed, and Uphilia at control. And since Uphilia, distancing herself from Anisphere, magically responds, Anisphere must pack her distance while dodging this.Uphilia sets up an arcane shell as she looks at the anisphere that comes accelerating at a distance. There is a thin smile on its mouth.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a comfortable thing, what about freedom\u201dThe sky is free. With feathers, we can go anywhere. The freedom of the sky suited Uphilia\u2019s skin so much that I thought it might have been unnatural before.That\u2019s why I know how horrible the anisphere is. I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m obviously better up there controlling my freedom of flight by magic. Yet Anisphere is more 'skillful\u201d.No matter how fast you lose, it\u2019s better to be free to move around small on the empty stage. And if you take a distance, Uphilia thinks you\u2019re more in your favor, specializing in battles that take a distance called magic.Yet there is an irrationality in Anisphere that does not seem to favour it. It makes you lick the bitterness of slowing down speed, predicting the path ahead of time, and packing the distance.\u201cThis is the world Annis was looking at\u2026\u201dBefore anyone else, before anyone else. Like saying this is where she should be.The idea of Anisphere is a concept not found in this world. Even solitude pushed Anisphere down the road. That\u2019s the free stage of the sky, the area of the former untouched.I remember one day when I flew caught on her back. It was a completely unknown experience for Uphilia, and I remembered a tremor of fear. Even now, maybe it does scare me.\u201cI can go everywhere\u2026 scared! Still, it\u2019s fun enough to fill your chest! Anis!\u201dHaha. Uphilia and the others were the only ones with zero laughter. Oh, from the bottom of my heart I\u2019m having fun, and Uphilia sets up an arcane shell to unleash her uncontrollable mind.It is the rainbow barrage that the swinging arcane shell draws out. Just a bullet of magic, with a wide variety of attributes. It unleashed like a shotgun.\u201cYikes!?\u201dAnisphere, who was flying toward Uphilia, opened her eyes. If you keep bumping into me, I get a handached attack. Attacks have spread widely to avoid them.Then. Anisphere slammed her magic into a hand not holding a celestial, a bracelet put on its arm.\u201cMana Shields!\u201dIn response to the cry of the Anisphere, a magic shield is formed on the front of the Anisphere. Take the bullet released by Uphilia and the anisphere blows back so that it is bounced.He glides straight through the sky, turns himself to make a turn on the spot, and flies again towards Uphilia.\u201cCelestial Ruh!\u201dAccelerate as Anisphere calls the name of his sword. Instead of heading straight for Uphilia, it seems to pack the distance as you circle.In the meantime, the magic blade that Celestial was unfolding crystallizes, and its crystals become light again to draw meteor-like trajectories.\u201cOveredge Separation!\u201dCelestial\u2019s magic blade, swung wide and horizontal, leaves the body and becomes a massive slaughter, approaching Uphilia.Ufiria spreads her rainbow feathers wide on her back to the rapidly approaching blow of Celestial. Try to stop on the spot and set up an arcane shell, wrapped around a blade crystallized by the arcane shell, just like the Anispheric Celestial, and shaken down with momentum.\u201cArcane shell, overedged\u201dArcanshell draws a rainbow sword flash so that he can slap Celestial\u2019s magic blade in two. But there was a recoil, and Uphilia smiled slightly.But raise the face that was distorted right up. I notice an anisphere looming in the front of it and open my eyes.\u201cGotcha! Ahhh!!\u201dThe reaction is delayed to the anisphere that has stuck his arm in front of him, and Ufiria\u2019s arm is grabbed. As it is, the anisphere will accelerate and remain pulled.The speed at which you can\u2019t catch up if you don\u2019t even tilt the magic control of Ufiria at all costs. Uphilia\u2019s face is distorted by pain as her arms pull up at that speed.\u201cDamn, ahhh!!\u201dIn a desperate phase, Ufiria ran thunder all over her body. To an attack that applied the magic of the lightning attribute, now Anisphere distorted his face and let go of Uphilia\u2019s hand.Uphilia turns consciousness to the speed and control of flight for that gap. Uphilia will also increase her speed so that she can follow the Anisphere, which was increasing her speed.If we catch up, we hit each other with a sword to respond, and the side to be chased and the side to be chased are replaced. Visually up, down, left and right, Anisphere and Uphilia bump into each other as they freely fly around.\u201cUffi!\u201d\u201cAnisu!\u201dIt was a smile on the faces of those two. They dance and dance in the sky like they say it\u2019s fun and they can\u2019t help it.They were two people in a brilliant aerial battle, but stops moving and stares at each other in the sky, as accidentally indicated.Sweat flows down my cheek and keeps flowing into the wind. Anisphere packs her distance from Uphilia as she tucks the celestial into the sheath she was lowering to her waist.\u201c\u2026 magic, I\u2019ve lost the other half\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201dBecause this flying magic prop packs a number of functions, it has the disadvantage of poor fuel consumption. It was decided in a prior meeting that this \u201ceyeball\u201d should be stopped after considering the safety aspects.Uphilia also reaches for Anisphere with Arcane Shell in her sheath. Hands stretched out to each other touch each other, gripping each other to tangle their fingers.Huh, Anisphere and Uphilia heard a resounding cheer from beneath their feet.In the castle town beneath his eyes, he waved heavily about whether he was excited to see the two aerial circles dance.The people of the castle town, the knights, the travellers, the nobles have nothing to do with it. Everyone looks up cheering for Anisphere and Uphilia to envy them.\u201c\u2026 anise\u201dUphilia squeezes her fingered hand hard. Anisphere looked at the cheering people and was just quietly zeroing tears.The popularity of magic props means that the possibilities are open to all so that even in the Anisphere, where magic cannot be handled, the sky can be emptied.Everyone dreams. Everyone has potential in their chest. I cannot say that there are no difficulties ahead. But now this is the only time everyone was laughing. He cheered loudly and was immersed in surprise and joy from the bottom of his heart.\u201c\u2026 Huh\u2026 Huh\u2026!What enters spreads into the chest of the anisphere. Here\u2019s the sight I wanted to fulfill right now.Ever since I woke up in this world, I\u2019ve been dreaming about the sight. I was about to give up hope that it would never come true.Anisphere was always free. I was alone because I was free, because I could go anywhere. But I\u2019m not alone anymore.I\u2019m not a princess of a stranger, a princess of royal disqualification, or a princess who can\u2019t use magic. Now that she\u2019s a flying princess, here she is admitted. At this moment, indeed, Anisphere was wanted by the country, by this world.\u201cAnnis, laugh\u201d\u201cUfi\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone wants you to smile.\u201dUphilia\u2019s fingers wipe Anisphere\u2019s tears. Still scratching tears, Anisphere smiled clumsily and showed them.Again, lower your gaze under your eyes. The cheer hasn\u2019t stopped, and our gaze keeps looking up at ourselves.Anisphere waved at such people. so that I may be made aware of my existence. Together, Uphilia waves too.It swells up again like a cheer exploded. With a cheer in his ear, Anisphere wipes her tears and pours her gaze into Uphilia.\u201c\u2026 Yufi, just hang out a little longer\u201d\u201cAnis?\u201dAnisphere tells Uphilia something. Besides, Uphilia turned her eyes round and then nodded to respond with a grin.Together, we pull out the sword of love that we put in our sheaths with our hands held together. With their hands held together as they were, they feathered each other\u2019s wings and wings.The two fly to lower altitude slowly. In the meantime, Celestial and Arcane Shell form a crystallized blade.\u201cIn the sky\u201d\u201cRainbow.\u201dThe two fly straight into circles over the castle town. Celestial and arcane shell crystals pour down like particles as they also plunder and fly over the royal castle.The glittering, light-dropping particles reach all those who see this sight.And then the two of them go up into the sky again. overlap each other\u2019s swords so that they may be raised in heaven.\u201cTo all the people, who live in this country\u201d\u201cBless you!Look at each other, laugh at each other. The words of prayer spinning made me play a crystallized blade.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.It\u2019s like fireworks. The empty light that could be played around the two of us and the rainbow light unravel into the universe with sparkle. As I put it, give blessings to all those who have seen this sight.The cheer never stops ringing. Everyone reaches for the falling particles of light. The particles of magic that fall into your hands, melt and disappear are fantastic enough to lose your voice.At its center, the winged Anisphere and Uphilia are laughing at each other. as if to show the future of this country. The two princesses held hands together forever.The aftermath of the eyeballs is over, and the night is coming. Still, the feast never stops.In a castle town lit with lights, there are people who drink and keep raising their voices of joy.Everyone looked forward to the future of this country for the pleasure they saw during the day. That\u2019s why we\u2019re having fun and laughing at each other from the bottom of our minds.Nothing is only enjoyed by people in castle towns.The royal castle venue also hosts a feast of nobles. Music by the band is played, and he is interested in a chat as he picks his gastronomy.Some talk about the future of the country, while others share opinions about flying magic. There was no one sad topic here, such as what could be done to spread demonic propaganda.\u201cPrincess Anisphere, it is the admission of Princess Uphilia!Anisphere and Uphilia show up at the venue after a third change of color there.Moments, cheers and applause echoed. As royalty, it was a storm of spare admiration for the two of us who made the bright future of this country feel so great today alone.Uphilia is a grand one, but it was impressive that Anisphere was waving her hands back like she was in some trouble.\u201cPrincess Uphilia! Have a great day!\u201cPrincess Anisphere! I was very impressed today!\u201cThank you\u201d\u201cOh no, even if you suddenly come like that!?\u201dPeople push to say hello to the princesses who enter to swarm at once. Though Uphilia smiles and returns calmly, Anisphere is at once swallowed by the waves of men and awkward.Afterwards, even with the admission of Orphans and Silphine, there was a scene where people would hardly pull from around the two princesses, and Orphans would flatter their shoulders, etc. But Orphans looked terribly calm then, Silphine later says.The music the band plays changes as time passes to make sure people swallow it.That was a signal that went from talking time to dancing time. The offer to dance to the two princesses arrived, as it should be said.\u201cAlso, I can\u2019t do it anymore\u2026\u2026!I walked out onto the balcony and drowned while keeping my hands shut. Today more than usual, I\u2019m very tired of signing up for a dance.I was tired of the pastime, and I managed to escape to the balcony to say the least, but I feel terribly tired. Ha, and exhale deeply and look up into the sky.I can see the stars well today, I think it\u2019s a good sky. In retrospect, it wasn\u2019t long ago. If you look back at today, your breasts will be filled with emotion.\u201c\u2026 I wish I could die now\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dThere was a voice returning the gavel to the words that made me squeal by accident. Looking back, my face was there as expected.\u201cUfi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m with you, Anis\u201d\u201cYeah. Uffi\u2019s getting out, too?\u201cYep. I saw you coming here.\u201dYufi deposits herself as she lines up next to me. Unlike me, I don\u2019t see the color of fatigue. I knew I was used to the place. It feels amazing. I can\u2019t even wear a mask anymore.\u201c\u2026 tired of boulders?\u201cYeah. You consumed a lot of magic too\u2026 is Yufi okay?\u201cKeep it in bed and you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201dYufi smiles with a joke in her mouth. That kind of makes me laugh.\u2026 and I have something to remember. I remember one day when I talked to Uffi like this.That was when Father announced that Uffi would be my assistant because he didn\u2019t even know the truth about the uproar of Alkun\u2019s betrothal.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d change this much\u201d\u201cSince I became your assistant, is that it?\u201cThis situation reminds me of that moment.\u201d\u201cWould you like to dance again?\u201cFine. I\u2019m tired, and now we\u2019re in the spotlight\u2026\u201d\u2026 So we somehow broke up our conversations with each other.Dance performance is still ongoing. You\u2019re cared for, there\u2019s no such thing as people out on the balcony. Because it\u2019s just me and Uffi leaving the venue, or somewhere I\u2019m losing my sense of reality.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m speechless\u201dYuffi is just silently listening to the words I whine about, unable to bear the silence.\u201cHow can I put this feeling into words,\u201d he said. I\u2019m gonna think about it. Otherwise, I can\u2019t sort it out, and I want to scream\u2026 \u201cAs I was putting it into words, Yuffi\u2019s arm drew me.Hugged by Yuffi\u2019s arms, he can stroke his back, pounding. I settle down so much that I regret it, I help to keep my body in Uphilia.\u201cIt was nice. It\u2019s been a really nice day from the bottom of my heart, Anis.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m really happy to meet you.\u201dUffi leaves himself a little and stares at each other as they face each other.I blushed my cheeks a little and Yufi was laughing really happily. Seeing that face made me feel my beat faster.\u2026 Now, I feel like it\u2019s natural. I can\u2019t even grasp it myself, it\u2019s a boring mind. I put it into words with my thoughts so that it would drop zero.\u201cI love you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 anise?\u201cI love you. More than anyone, more than anything. Yufi, I love you.\u201dI love you. I shrug as I repeat my overflowing feelings.Round your eyes like Uffi was surprised. The look slowly turns to a smile.\u201cI love you. Anis, me too. Above all else in the world.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. I\u2019m so glad I was born in this world\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really glad to see you, too.\u201dWe closed our eyes and lay our lips to engage with nature.I will not forget the happiness of today. About the day the dream I dreamed of opened.I did engrave my beloved country, my beloved world, and my beloved in this breast.I was finally able to bite the meaning of living in this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: 72I beg your pardon.Face up to the voice called with the sound of a knock. I sat in a rocking chair and my consciousness became clear that I had left myself to the raucous cheerfulness.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? What can I do for you?\u201cDeliverables\u201d\u201c\u2026 deliveries?Who the hell gives permission to enter the room swallowing the question? I accidentally breathed when I saw what the butler who came in with the courtesy had offered me.\u201c\u2026 he\u2019s just as rude as ever.\u201d\u201cWould you like to receive it?\u201cOh. Let\u2019s get some eye spills today or so. Is today a good day?The butler, uh, whined and nodded a word. Oh, I suppose so. It\u2019s a good day.\u2013 Time flied.The Kingdom of Palletia ushered in a time of transformation by the publication and diffusion of magic.Production of magic props began everywhere and needed manpower for a new cause. Due to the need for specialized knowledge, nobility is taking the lead, but in the future the policy of opening schools for civilians should also be educated.At the same time as opening wide doors to civilians everywhere, there have been improvements in an attempt to mediate work for civilians who have so far fallen asleep as refugees. The new business was understaffed in nothing, and the result was to give many people the art of obtaining food for life.Much of the change was in the lives of the civilians, but even the nobles did not have any movement.As the biggest move, the demolition of the Ministry of Magic took place. This was to divide the roles that the Ministry of Magic had assumed.The influence of spiritual faith, elucidated by magic, is immense. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Magic\u2019s role was divided by the merits of protecting the country and the appeal that the preservation of culture was necessary.Many said that the mystery of the Spirit diminished as magic clarified the reality of the Spirit.But there were also many who said it was surprising because it was Anisphere, an advocate of magic, who rebelled against this theory more than anyone else.No matter how much you elucidate the Spirit, you can\u2019t shake that the Spirit is the shard of the world, the embodiment of nature. We must deepen our understanding in order to make effective use of the Spirit\u2019s bounty as a resource.But as such, we must not forget to thank the Spirit. Even if the Spirit has no heart, a Spirit is a mirror that reflects a man\u2019s heart. If so, the Spirit Faith must not be abolished.Based on that premise, Anisphere insisted that it was still people who ran the country. If a person is with the Spirit, do not forget what it feels like to think of the Spirit as a friend. It\u2019s not good to have blind faith. This appeal gathered some support, and the dismantling of the Ministry of Magic was stepped down.The preservation and recording of the culture originally held by the Ministry of Magic was handed down to the province that changed its name to \u201cMinistry of the Spirit,\u201d so that those who were filled with faith in the Spirit would leave their homes intact.Those who were studying magic itself moved to a new province named \u201cMinistry of Magic\u201d. The invention and analysis of magic and magic props will be stepped up as the research institute responsible in the future.And it was the Knights who were enlivened.Their environment was greatly improved and innovated with popular magic tools, which transformed them into even more resilient organizations.In this context, there has been an urgent need to secure spiritual resources. Because spiritual and demonic stones were judged essential to develop magic while maintaining existing life.The Knights who have been asked to intensify their struggle will be given demonic equipment as a priority.\u2026 For the record, this influence is not all good. Particularly affected were the Kingsguard Knights assigned to the King\u2019s Capital.They would not have dreamed that they would be more involved in the development and experimentation of the Ministry of Magic and Sciences, and that they would be slapped into the Hell\u2019s Picture of the Annunciation because of it.Exciting changes accelerate times, for better or worse. It will take some geometric time for the Kingdom of Palletia to regain a calm peace.And the Kingdom of Palletia welcomes the celebrations that symbolize the changes of this era.It is the departure of His Majesty Orphans and the reign of the new \u201cQueen\u201d.\u201cWhat happened to him?!?\u201dOne room in the royal castle, where there was an orphan who raised his voice of anger. Those who were in that room, catching their eyes to see and revealing their anger, are smiling bitterly.And there is one face that floats, if it is called a lying man. It was Silphine who sighed like a coward and shook Orphans. Though she also holds her head down like a pain with her.\u201cUnfortunately, not yet\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you I\u2019d be home soon! I told you to go back so sparingly, what are you doing!!\u201d\u201cPrincess Anisphere\u2026\u201dMatthew was the one who zeroed the pounding and whining. Behind that brain is a common figure of a brain-weather princess with a full smile on her face.Yes. The reason Orphans is so mad is because of that anisphere. Anisphere is not currently in the Royal Castle. That was what was oiling Orphans\u2019 anger fire.\u201cIt\u2019s Uphilia\u2019s crowning ceremony today!? Do you know what I mean?\u201cI think I jumped out in a hurry because I know\u2026\u201dYes, today is the day of the crowning ceremony for Uphilia to officially succeed Orphans as queen.Uphilia takes over as queen. This was accepted by the country without confusion. It is also significant that at the time I adopted Ufiria over my ex, everyone thought it would be like that.And he made many achievements in the former Ministry of Magic and now in the Ministry of Magic. Orphans appreciated this and pushed Uphilia, who was no real child, up as queen.Today is a good day to celebrate it\u2026. but I don\u2019t see Anisphere here. Then Orphans gets angry too.\u201cWhere did he pop up in the first place, he is!?\u201d\u201cClosed! Or so I screamed and pulled out Airdra and flew in a hurry\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not closed!!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 please calm down\u2026\u201d\u201cThat insanity\u2026\u2026! You don\u2019t have to show your destructiveness until a day like this!! Can you do it a little too much!!\u2026 you can\u2019t!!\u201dNow the air fills the room. Everyone laughs bitterly when they see Orphans moving around indoors like hungry bears.It was Orphans who waited for this day more than anyone else. There is also a personal sentiment that allows me to lay down the weight of a king. But above all, it\u2019s a sunny stage for my daughters. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s harder without emotion.\u201cCalm down, Orphans\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s Grants!\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change where I just said it\u2026. and\u201dIt was Grants who spoke to Orphans. He grinned at his mouth and glanced at the window.\u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019ll make sure you make it, won\u2019t he?I could hear a dragon hissing from afar. Orphans, hearing the sound, frowned whether this was it or not, and caught his eyes to the limit.\u201cAs soon as we land, capture! Keep it up, keep it up!\u201cOh, no, no, no, no, I\u2019m totally late, no, I can still make it, I can, I can!\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you. You\u2019re not leaving? What?\u201d\u201cKeep it tighter! Lumi idiot!\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t believe you told me that.\u201dYou\u2019re a really rude ancestor!? No, but this time I\u2019m not out of line to complain because I really got your help, but I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late today enough to say I\u2019m a boulder!? Please don\u2019t laugh at me like I\u2019m having fun!?I loosen up Airdra\u2019s speed as I put Lyumi on my back. As I slowed down to land, I lowered Airdra to the side of the outhouse.Make sure that Airdra stopped completely and keep the lumi that was riding behind me. I run out to the royal castle.\u201cLumi! Clean up, please!\u201cYes, yes, go.\u201dLeave it to Lhumi, who waves flirtatiously, and I run to the royal castle with all my might. I think Father is angry with the boulder. I mean, I\u2019m absolutely mad. Even though there\u2019s a distance, I feel like I\u2019m being slapped in the wrath of my father.No, it\u2019s not, Father! Even I was planning to go back! That\u2019s why I asked Lumi to do it! I mean, I did my own responsibility, so the bad news is Llumi! Yes, it\u2019s a lumi!\u201cPerfect theoretical armed\u2026\u2026! Overwhelmingly innocent!\u201cIt\u2019s full of holes, that. And I\u2019m convicted.\u201dAll of a sudden I was set up with a foot payment with a voice that reached my ear. I was in a hurry and threw myself out into the universe on a foot payment.It was the feeling of rope that tied my whole body up, not the feel of a stiff floor, that struck me with my eyes closed wondering if I could be slapped.\u201cGuh!? Ouch, this hurts!? Raini, the rope is eating in!!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s good\u201dIt was Raini who looked down at me. Obviously, I\u2019m staring at you with an angry face. Wow, my eyes are glowing bright red shitty\u2026\u2026! This is pretty bad. I\u2019m mad at you\u2026!Raini walks out with the rope that tied me up in his hand. Hey, hey!? At least you have something to take charge of!?\u201cHey, hey here. Not too cluttered about my handling these days!?\u201d\u201cBecause it is a service I have taken over from Master Ilia\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t even get this far in Ilia!? Oh, stop, don\u2019t pull it off!! Walk yourself! \u2018Cause I\u2019m walking!! Let me explain later!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you really want to reflect once in a cage?\u201dThe rope that was tangled in my legs untied me, but my hands were restrained and pulled and captured like sinners. Ugh, even I hurried back\u2026!\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is not to me to apologize, but to His Majesty. Don\u2019t you already have dirt and dust and terrible clothes and hair! It\u2019s a whole wash!\u201cIt works! But it hurts! Raini, the rope hurts!Eventually, the rope was taken to the bathroom without being removed and sprinkled with water with his clothes on. And they take off their clothes so that they\u2019re stripped off, and they literally wash them whole.Once the whole wash is done, they tap into the bathroom and raise the big blister. Nose! Water in my nose! The back of my nose hurts!!\u201cHa, not at all\u2026 don\u2019t make me go through the trouble\u201d\u201cI made you like it so much\u2026\u201d\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m really glad I made it\u2026. Good for you?\u201cWhat\u2019s that push?!?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we check with the person later? I don\u2019t know. And don\u2019t stay out of the palace today, because I\u2019m going home. Ilaria\u2019s inviting you too, so I\u2019ll take you home, won\u2019t I?I mean, what stays out of the palace, inevitably. Thinking that far, I blued my face sassy.\u201c\u2026 wait. Okay, wait. It was my fault. I found out more or less what happened. But we made it, so there\u2019s room for clarification!?\u201d\u201cCome on?\u201d\u201cCome on? No!?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll wash it.\u201d\u201cWow! Wait, it gets in my eyes!!\u201d\u2026 In the meantime, it seems better not to defy Raini now. We need to do something about the reprimands we refrain from after this\u2026\u2026!\u201cOh my God!! Oh my God, oh my God!\u201d\u201cOuch!? My butt hurts!!\u201dHe went up from the bathroom and was dressed as a samurai and thrown in front of his father. My father caught me flowing and slapped me in the ass three times. I can\u2019t solve it!\u201cI thought it was a lie, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d do it again today!\u201cWait, Father! I have room for illustration too! Have a fair trial!I don\u2019t have a lawyer for you.\u201cWitch trial!? Tyranny! I claim my right to keep my own, Mother!\u201cRejected. And, Orphans, that sounds like interesting magic. Can I do it, too?\u201d\u201cHih\u2026! No, come on! If my mother did it, I\u2019d definitely fly my guts and stuff. No!?\u201dI said Bachi! I said Bachi!? Oops, it hurts so much that the back of my eye is jean!! I don\u2019t feel it in my butt anymore!! It\u2019s cracked!! It\u2019s cracked!! Wow, I think I\u2019m gonna throw up\u2026!My knees are like fresh-born deer, but I don\u2019t think they let me go on the floor because I was wearing a dress. Maybe he\u2019s dumped on the floor if he\u2019s normal. My mother is staring at me with a cold smile\u2026\u201cWhat do you say?\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNice.\u201dMove your feet according to distance from your mother, who nodded contentedly. Ugh, it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s terrible, even though I\u2019m force majeure this time\u2026First of all, the rhumi is bad! Lumi! I should keep this grudge clear!!\u201cThen apologize firmly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh, could you be angry?\u201cI thought I\u2019d check with my own eyes.\u201dLord Grants, why are you having such fun? Mrs. Nerschel is laughing with her hands on her mouth, too. Hey, Chief Sprout Knights, why did you look away? I\u2019m not laughing.Doesn\u2019t it look like you came to my father\u2019s room just to get mad at me for some reason!? No, that\u2019s all I came up for!? No point in coming!?\u201cLook, I\u2019m coming. Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 I got my ass slapped for nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s scolding me first, so I think you\u2019ll add and subtract a little over there. Do you want to be pissed off without adding or subtracting?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Raini, silence is money. I didn\u2019t say anything and followed Raini\u2019s guide.\u201cWelcome back, sister-in-law\u201d\u201cSorry!!\u201dYou don\u2019t usually call me that, do you?!? I bowed my head first to succumb.It was to Uffi that I bowed my head. She smiles thinly and makes me think of her as an angel or a goddess. If you can\u2019t even see the blue muscles floating in that temple.Such a Yufi outfit is already beautiful. I\u2019ve exhausted a word. They tailored the costume this time to take over as queen. With the exception of Lhumi, Yufi\u2019s costume, who is also a spiritual contractor, was particularly detained for becoming the first queen in history.Also, there was talk of me pinching my opinion, but I was banished from my mother because I had no taste. No, it\u2019s nothing good, but I don\u2019t interpret it\u2026No, I don\u2019t care about that now. It\u2019s been a name I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a distance or not between you and your sister since the call. I need to regain my position!\u201cUh\u2026 it\u2019s so beautiful, Uffi!\u201cWhy do you tell me to delude myself that I have an affair like that? Sister-in-law\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry about the rhumi, I tried to get back at my proper leisure!\u201cIn front of my big day, you dazzled Rhumi with your whereabouts, and it must have been fun, right? Sister-in-law\u201d\u201cChi, no\u2026\u201d\u201cSister-in-law\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t! It was my fault! Get in a good mood!\u2018Cause I couldn\u2019t have done anything without Lumi. Ooh! Even I tried to move at more leisure, and yet I had a heap of work that I had to handle\u2026!If I finish it in a hurry, the due date is critical, and if I\u2019m in custody, Rhumi won\u2019t tell me it\u2019s going to be past due!\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re desperate\u201d\u201cOh, my God, Ilia! I\u2019m not laughing!!\u201dPugh, and I accidentally stare at Ilia, who blew out and turned away. I\u2019ve totally given Raini a superficial job lately, Ilia, but I feel like she\u2019s been mocking me more since she started holding back on me! disrespect!\u2026 without the scratch that I\u2019m bad for doing things that make me laugh!\u201c\u2026 ha, my father-in-law must have scolded me for improving too, so I\u2019ll take it hand-to-hand here. Anis.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat were you going to do in the first place? They jumped out without even telling me.\u201dIlia asks me strangely. No, I did leave in a hurry, but you\u2019re saying I only talked to Rhumi in the first place\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWas Her Royal Highness Princess Uphilia and Her Royal Highness Princess Anisphere here too? The crowning ceremony will begin shortly. Get ready.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOh, the crowning ceremony has begun!?Oh, wow, duh, what am I gonna do! I\u2019m not ready yet. No!\u201cUh-uh, uh-uh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what are you roaring about\u201d\u201c\u2026 Raini and Ilia take their seats off\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI need to talk to Uffi!\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t have much time?\u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon!Raini looks surprised and tilts his neck. Ilia was staring at my face, but she sighed whether she had guessed anything or whether she was frightened.\u201cRaini, let\u2019s go\u201d\u201c\u2026 then you\u2019ll be waiting outside\u201dRaini will also exit if Ilia urges him. Drop the two of them off and then I take a deep breath to stroke my chest down.And once again, gaze at Uffi. Yufi looks at me jizzily.\u201c\u2026 First of all, I\u2019m really sorry I\u2019m late. It was true that you were going to come back early. It\u2019s just a little tricky.\u201d\u201cHandcuffs?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. Uffi, right hand, let me out\u201d\u201c? Ha\u2026\u201dSurprisingly, Uffi offers me his right hand. Take that hand and put the 'sole\u201d I was holding in my hand through Yuffi\u2019s finger.A ring seemingly white, but fitted with spiritual stones within which you can see rainbow-like colors with the addition or subtraction of light. Fit that in Yuffi\u2019s right hand pharmacopoeia.Yufi remains decent, blinking her eyes many times and staring at the ring.\u201c\u2026 Lumi made me a stone and I made my own part of the pedestal. It\u2019s not a magic trick, but I thought I\u2019d give it to you instead of a amulet.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cYu, if Yufi is going to wear a ring, I think Spirit Stone is going to be better than a gem, talk to him all the time, but it takes a lot of work to make a stone, the\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d like to be a queen, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to avoid the engagement story. There was some advice from Lyumi, and the timing got lost, but I really wanted to give it to Yufi\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 Ufi?Yufi just left me in a mood. I don\u2019t have a ring. I\u2019m staring. What, what is that reaction, Ufi\u2026?\u201c\u2026 hahhh\u2026\u201d\u201cOh yeah!? Awesome sigh!?\u201dUffi sighed at me so disappointingly. What, maybe I didn\u2019t like it!? It feels like I\u2019m mad at you and I can\u2019t even tell you things!?\u201c\u2026 idiot\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201dYes, I\u2019m an idiot\u2026\u2026As I was so depressed that I wanted to be buried already, Uffi took my right hand.Uffi\u2019s fingers touch the very roots of my pharmacopoeia. It\u2019s kind of ticklish.\u201c\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t make sense if we didn\u2019t align\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t align, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh, yeah\u201d\u201cFool.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI\u2019m the fool who got ahead.\u201cI wish I could have stayed with you the whole day. And yet you\u2019re not coming back, and you\u2019re not coming back until the last minute, and how much less time do you think I\u2019ve had with you? Today\u2019s the only day, isn\u2019t it? Do you understand?\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cYet all of a sudden they give me this\u2026 do you think I can stay sane\u201dThey hold me, and I\u2019m hugged by Uffi hard enough to make it painful. Even though the exhalation was faintly trembling, I could immediately notice it.\u201cI put up with it. I put up with a lot today.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI will endure a lot from now on. But I will say all I can in front of you alone. Because I want to tell you all about me.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come this far for you. I just wish you were next door, but if you were shaped like this, I\u2019d want you too\u2026\u2026!My cheeks are hot. Yufi\u2019s exhalation was ticklish, and the thoughts and words that could be directed at her were all warm.\u201cWhen we\u2019re done, shall we make it together? A sign for both of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s a promise, right?Of course.\u201c\u2026 but that\u2019s not enough\u201d\u201c\u2026 hmm?Yufi puts her body away and grabs my hand. Keep walking towards the entrance. All I can do is walk away from Yufi.\u201cI won\u2019t give in anymore. As soon as we become queens, you will have them too.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you say you don\u2019t like me that much, I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m yours, and you\u2019re mine, too. Now, yes, now.\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute! Today is the crowning ceremony!? What are you going to do at the crowning ceremony?\u201d\u201cHmm, it is. You took it personally, so I\u2019ll take it personally.\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute, Uffi! Oh, hey, Raini! Ilia, Yufi\u2019s upset! Somebody stop!?\u201dYufi\u2019s hand cannot be waved away. The right hand that grabs my left hand also loses power in the ring that is embedded in that hand.It\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s a blessed day. But if it comes true. If it is good to wish for something.Please forgive me for continuing to hold this hand. God.That must be a magical and wonderful miracle.So we will always be. I keep admiring magic.Fly to its end as you aim for a distant sky.Our longing never stops. All the time, all the time, and beyond.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73: 73Things have changed around me since Yuffi became queen.Uffi entered the royal castle\u2019s office instead of his father and began to conduct his affairs as queen. Although his father and mother, who became his predecessor, are in as assistants, he says he plans to change his title from assistant to advisor within it and also pull himself off the front lines of government.The former Ministry of Magic also broke up with the Ministry of Magic and Spirituality and divided their roles and activities to improve the organization.Halfis, who served as Uffi\u2019s assistant, keeps his place with Marion in the Ministry of Magic. The two of us look very happy that we\u2019re finally getting to be recognized around.They\u2019re living a full life because they\u2019re reviewing basic magic classes they learn at the Aristocratic Academy right now.Gakun seems busy every day in the Kingsguard Knights. The Kingsguard Knights seem to be very busy with the spread of demonic props and the start of mass production. You think massive personnel enhancements are also contemplated in the near future?Their increased work also involves sending knights who are skilled in handling magic props to various locations to train in them. They are secretly delighted by the increasing number of cases of aristocracy returning to their territories where they had the opportunity to stay and knight in the royal castle.Every day are busy knights, but that look was bright. Sometimes I see you screaming in connection with the Ministry of Magic\u2019s magic props experiments and verifications.Thomas returned to his workshop while remaining a consultant. I was satisfied that I had done enough of what I could, even though it was not suitable for my sexuality. Later, in his workshop, he said he wanted to get the job he wanted to get, and the skills he wanted to poke at.It seems that the track record of working as a technical advisor for this propaganda campaign has made Tomas\u2019 name known to the world, and the customer\u2019s legs have become uninterrupted while in a small workshop. Some of them want to be apprentices, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to stay in that little workshop.All those close to me are working hard in their new positions and lives.In that, I\u2026\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re free.\u201dOh, my God, I was free.While my title is changing from First Princess to Her Royal Highness Sister Wang, I have no position either.For example, hanging advisors from the Ministry of Magic and the Ministry of Defense, and then treating the substantive queen because of the \u201cDeclaration of the Substantial Queen\u201d that Ufi did for me at the crowning ceremony.But I don\u2019t have a job coming around myself. There are several reasons for this, one of which is because the Ministry of Magic has just been established as a new organization.They\u2019re still busy sending the existing products I\u2019ve completed to the world, and then reviewing the existing magic and putting them to the ground.Because I am the creator of magic, I am told that the idea and foundation are moving ahead of people. So it\u2019s the current situation that doesn\u2019t fit the story yet. All you can come about me is that\u2019s a handful of them stepping into magic research on the front lines like Ufi and Halfis.So, at least until it became something, I got deposited with my new involvement in the study of magic. So I\u2019m not doing any new research on magic right now.It\u2019s not like I have a job to train and improve my understanding of magic, but I\u2019ve been refused because I want you to give it to me later. Because teaching leads to proficiency, I can\u2019t say I can\u2019t do it either.Then I thought about sticking with the Knights and sending them all over the place to train in the magic tools, but they also want me to see the time of year, so this one has been turned down gently.\u201cEverybody, don\u2019t work for me so hard and don\u2019t take it away?I did have a lot going on until I got here. I also know that I still want people to be big enough to have a lot of influence because I\u2019m crossing a big mountain range and riding a new wave. So when he finally asked me to rest, I followed him.So, after I started sparing time, I realized. They\u2019re trying to keep me away from work. The study of magic, about the propagation of magic props. That? Isn\u2019t that strange?\u201cIsn\u2019t that good? Master Anisphere just kept working until Queen Uphilia came to power.\u201dThat\u2019s what Ilia says as she brews me tea. But I frown unconvinced.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t deny that. But it\u2019s not like Uffi\u2019s finally on track when she\u2019s queen. So they say it\u2019s okay for me to rest\u2026 something unsettling?\u201cNow the Anisphere moves because it doesn\u2019t have a good influence on every aspect. Now is the time to consolidate the foundations. Therapeutics there\u2026 Hey, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to be too irritating, do you?\u201cYou think people are drugs, Ilaria? Hey, keep your eyes peeled.\u201dIlia remains out of the palace as usual. Raini is often not out of the palace these days because he has given Raini a superficial job. The Raini is now taught by the royal castle samurai.In the future, Raini will have more opportunities to be on the table as the exclusive of Uffi, so you think he\u2019s getting a tough education every day because he has to be polished as a samurai and as a baroness?Still, Raini looks like he\u2019s having fun looking full. I think I\u2019ve become more sociable than I was when I was taken away by this outhouse.So it is inevitable that Ilia will take care of me. I live away from the palace, so if it\u2019s night, Yufi and Raini will be back. I\u2019m kind of restless that time passes with nothing to do.\u201cDidn\u2019t Lady Anisphere fulfill her big dream? I think I could stretch my wings a little bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes, but come on\u201dFly in the sky. I want to spread that to everyone. I want you to admit it\u2019s my \u201cmagic\u201d. And I want to be the kind of wizard everyone laughs at. I think such a wish was indeed fulfilled.Now everyone tries to spread my \u201cmagic\u201d all over the country. That leads to someone smiling and enriching each day. The sight I wanted is there. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to do something too\u2026\u201d\u201cStill no work for Master Anisphere. \u2026 or would you like to study to get fully involved in politics or get your Queen educated?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I wonder if that\u2019s okay too\u201dI squealed by accident. Then Ilia blinked her eyes and immediately sighed.Then he pushed his forehead around with his finger. He looks kind of like Ilia was stunned.\u201cHow tired you are to want to study something you don\u2019t like.\u201d\u201cYep\u2026? If you were tired, you wouldn\u2019t want to study. Because I\u2019m free. Hi-ma!\u201cIf you\u2019re free, why don\u2019t you do your own research? You\u2019re not blamed for your personal research, are you?\u201c\u2026 yes, but come on. But this is it now! I don\u2019t even have to say that.\u201dI don\u2019t know what Ilia\u2019s saying, but she\u2019s kind of full of breasts, or she\u2019s not coming, and she\u2019s not coming up with the next idea.It\u2019s like my chest is full, but my hole is hollow. You mean it doesn\u2019t come down to the feeling of diving into your world like it was before you took over Uffi?\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re seriously ill\u201d\u201cHuh? Did I say something?\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. What if it\u2019s a dance lesson? It would also be unhealthy not to move your body. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in keeping the drill loaded.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 well, that\u2019s fine\u201dI don\u2019t even like dancing, but I\u2019m less resistant to dancing with men. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any opportunities at all in the future, and I won\u2019t do it unless I\u2019m free.Thus I stood up to take dance lessons while Ilia invited me.It was not long before Anisphere began to question her spare time.\u201cWe should give Master Anisphere a break, should we?It was Halfis who rounded his eyes and sounded unexpected. Now remarkable as a talented woman on the front lines of the Ministry of Magic, she leaned her neck on the agenda for today\u2019s call.All that was gathered here were those who had intimacy with Anisphere, and gathered together on summons from Uphilia, and a meeting place was set up.It was Uphilia who cut out the agenda. Uphilia nods and shows one that has completely begun to show her majesty as queen.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to give Annis some rest for a while.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?Marion, present with Halfis, raises a voice of doubt.Would it be of such a nature that that anisphere is told to rest and rest? And he thinks. I don\u2019t think Anisphere, who has behaved like a wreck, is making a big deal out of that favorite thing.\u201cTo cure the anise.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sanatorium? Is something wrong with you?\u201cNo. I just decided Anis needed some rest. I\u2019ve been thinking about this since Annis started spreading magic at the Department of Defense. My crowning ceremony is over, and I thought it would be a good opportunity.\u201d\u201cBut Master Anisphere is motivated or still going to pop up\u2026 Even though magic has finally begun to orbit\u2026\u201d\u201cAnis is a leader in magic, but the leap in ideas can be terrible. Now it\u2019s time to consolidate the foundations, and it\u2019s not a good time to influence anise poorly.\u201d\u201cWell, even if Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere becomes the standard, don\u2019t bother.\u201dIt was Miguel who said it with a laugh. And everyone gathered on the spot nodded, indeed, to agree.\u201c\u2026 In the first place, it\u2019s not just the temperament of the person that makes the idea of anise odd. There was a problem with the environment.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to the environment\u2026 have you always been away from the palace?\u201cThere\u2019s that too. And now it\u2019s down, but there were a large number of people who didn\u2019t recognize or accept Anis. Annis doesn\u2019t seem to care, but there\u2019s a verse where he was running oddly because he cares about the eyes around him. As a result, Anise doesn\u2019t omit herself.\u201dHa, and Uphilia exhales. Everyone knew that the troubling sigh was a guide to the cardiac anisphere.\u201cUntil now, there was a trend that was allowed to happen. But now Anis cannot be indispensable to this country. I also admire Anise, but since she\u2019s a queen, she can\u2019t always be watched.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so is that a cure?\u201cThese are the words Lord Grants uttered. Anis is sick of heart, he said. In fact, I even get my hands on a method that can be too contraindicated that doesn\u2019t skip me. You can\u2019t deny that because you\u2019re sick.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Engraved \u201d?Ilia groans bitterly. \u201cEngraved mark\u201d is the method of engraving the engraving on the back of an anisphere that has recently become known.This is confidential and is only open to those close to Anisphere and some executive officers. I would like to think that there is no one but Anisphere who wants to spend on himself, but if people get together, there are people who think evil things.\u201cDepending on the way you look at it, you can also say that Anis was being pushed so far as he had to. No one can blame me and no one will notice. It was not pursued either because magic was a mystery, but now that the technical release of magic has begun, some may eventually notice the engraving marks of the anise\u201d\u201cEngraving marks can\u2019t be called the dark side of magic\u2026\u201dRaini was the one who groaned anxiously. It\u2019s an indirect story for her, but there\u2019s something I think.Magic science is now beginning to be widely accepted as something that revitalizes the country. But I cannot say that there is no one who does not misuse that technology or knowledge. It is the engraved mark that could be its hotbed.There are aspects of light and darkness in every thing. Engraved marks can be a substitute for that negative symbol.\u201cSooner or later, you need to hit your hand before you get misunderstood, but it\u2019s premature for a boulder. If you take the wrong opportunity to do so, the support that has been gathered in the corner anise will also be adversely affected. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of giving Annis a break for a while, along with her health care. In the meantime, I\u2019d like to correct some of the ruggedness.\u201dThus, the treatment of anisphere was determined.(Master Anisphere must also be confused that the environment has changed\u2026\u2026)While serving as the opponent for the dance, Ilia looks at Anisphere\u2019s face, I think.The great purpose of the anisphere was fulfilled. From now on, what she does will be widely accepted. But that\u2019s a little further. If you produce too much flying stuff, even those who have begun to embrace how much magic can repel it.Maybe Anisphere also feels unconscious about that. The research fever that I was so passionate about also seems a little cold right now. Or, I\u2019m not comfortable not doing anything.You can rest, even if they say you have to do something, as if that\u2019s what you think. So I look for what I have to do. Even though that\u2019s not necessary, Ilia thinks.(Even if you say you\u2019re free to do what you want\u2026 maybe you\u2019re still confused. Try to feel it)Ilia doesn\u2019t think the environment surrounding us changed so much.All of them were even in jeopardy when Prince Algard became king and didn\u2019t even leave Anisphere\u2019s place.Maybe it\u2019s me who\u2019s confused. That\u2019s why I gave Raini the role I was in.(Now there is Queen Uphilia, and Raini. Neither His Majesty the King nor Her Majesty the King, that is all. This one is not alone anymore)Ilia\u2019s mouth smiles softly from the thought that she doesn\u2019t need to hold it alone.Annisphere tilts her neck wonderfully when she notices a change in Ilia\u2019s expression. Seeing the appearance of such a Lord, Illia returned nothing.Now, please, pray that you rest those wings that kept flying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: 74Her Majesty Queen Ufiria Fez Palettia is busy.The Kingdom of Palletia is now ushering in a time of change. The changes associated with that transformation produce a variety of impacts, both good and bad.Ufilia\u2019s first job as queen was to survive the rough waves associated with this transformation.\u201cSoaring spiritual stone prices are unlikely to be avoided\u2026\u201d\u201cDemand for spiritual stones is growing more than ever.\u201dReturning words to Uphilia, who shrugged with a frown, is now the orphan of his predecessor, who helps with his official duties as assistant to the Queen.\u201cThere\u2019s a portion of it that was stored in the treasury during the Ministry of Magic, but what\u2019s going to happen to mining in the future?\u201d\u201cIf the Knights continue to spread their magic props, they may be able to expect a more stable supply than they do now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you should still consider how to obtain spiritual stones other than mining. I\u2019ll send out a circular to the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cEarlier, we should hit the fabric stone.\u201dThe most affected by the transformation caused by magic was the Spirit Stone, a specialty of the Kingdom of Palletia. A spiritual stone that has always been a necessity to support trade and was a help to the people\u2019s lives, but the demand for magic was also added here.If it is an existing magic prop, and it is a daily product that helps you to live, you can also replace it with what you have consumed in your life.But that\u2019s a future story. Old life remains the same until magic becomes the norm in everyday life.Furthermore, new development of magic props will take place in the future. Demand for spiritual stones will not decrease. Uphilia believes that measures for the stable supply of spiritual stones should be explored in anticipation of that future.\u201cFor a review of the educational policy of the College of Lords, please send an outline in writing to each noble house. Prepare materials, especially for those with significant changes.\u201d\u201cHmm. Is this the Ministry of Magic, too?\u201cYes, I will turn this to Halphis. Take her as the person in charge and ask her to elect the person in charge from each province to discuss it.\u201d\u201cAye, okay. Let\u2019s finish it that way.\u201dThe education of the College of Aristocrats is also reviewed by Halphis around magic, but it is expected that significant changes will also be made, especially in the content regarding spiritual faith and morality that the Ministry of Magic was pushing for.Balance it by electing a representative from among those who transferred their citizenship there to the Spirit Ministry. And that will be joined by the Ministry of Defense, which had previously left the national government.\u201cBut I knew it, but the burden would be concentrated on the Ministry of Magic\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a province to cope with the influence of magic that will grow in the future. As I understand it, I\u2019d like to get my hands on replenishing personnel early\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about including special classes to join the Ministry of Magic for students at the College of Lords next semester? There would still have been classes for knight aspirants and former magic ministry aspirants, wouldn\u2019t there?\u201c\u2026 you don\u2019t have the option of not hiring. It just takes a lot of time. Plus, we don\u2019t have enough people to develop that talent. It\u2019s going to strain Halfis\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s troubling\u2026 but it\u2019s also a headache that it would be desirable for a woman as talented as Miss Halfis to let down my theories and ideas\u2026\u201d\u201cThough Marion is assisting me, I want to avoid too many wrinkles going to the Ministry of Magic, including Halfis. We\u2019re not going to crush them.\u201dWhat bothers Uphilia most now is the lack of human resources. While the teachings of magic are spreading, it is the seeds of headaches that lack the human resources to make the teachings widely known.The diffusion of magic is urgent, but few have reached the level at which its diffusion can take place. Inevitably, she\u2019s going to assign her job to Halfis, who was Uphilia\u2019s secretary, but she\u2019s already been taken by a magic class review.I\u2019m going to get involved in the education relationship because it\u2019s on the extension line, but if we even put people in there, it\u2019s overwork on the boulder. Uphilia\u2019s troubles are also deep around Halphis and Marion still floating first.\u201cI don\u2019t care what the advocate Anis says, because I have trouble getting more typographical breaks under the influence of Arr\u2026\u201d\u201cEnnis is going too far.\u201d\u201cOh man, I still can\u2019t seem to get out of this seat, either. I need you to respond to Yuffi\u2019s policy on magic.\u201d\u201cI will take over my father-in-law\u2019s duties in the future, but in the meantime, I want to make sure I have people who can shake my job\u2026\u201dUphilia sighed quietly, saying there seemed to be no time to slow down for a while.(Your father is coordinating the work around the Department of Defense, so that would help\u2026\u2026)After an ever-increasing amount of intense duty, Uphilia exhales softly and continues on the road back to the outhouse.The sun is completely down and I repeat my life of getting out in the morning and going back to night. In the meantime, the rest of the day doesn\u2019t diminish the mountain of work.Even if I meant to know, I actually get the feeling that being a king is harsh.\u201cI\u2019m back now\u201dUfilia enters the outer palace after returning her escort to the outer palace.It\u2019s the talking room where Uphilia heads first after the errand. If you open the door to the talking room, you\u2019ll see the anisphere sitting on the couch placed in the room.\u201cAh, welcome back. Yufi.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m just here\u2026. What about Ilia?\u201cPrepare dinner. Raini\u2019s going that way, too.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHearing that Ilia and Raini, the other inhabitants of the outhouse, are not here, Uphilia sits next to the Anisphere and weighs in so that she keeps her head on the shoulder of the Anisphere.With Uphilia leaning over, Anisphere just loosened her mouth a little and stroked her head to comb Uphi\u2019s hair.\u201cGood day again\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUphilia shrugs her cheeks as she narrows her eyes to the feel of Annisphere\u2019s fingers.Ufiria has lived a fulfilling life since she became queen, but she also feels just as tired. So when I look at Anisphere\u2019s face, I feel relaxed.Are you accustomed to being sweet too Anisphere, smiling smiling as you stroke Uphilia\u2019s head and continuing to comb her hair.\u201cIt\u2019ll take a little longer for dinner, so get some sleep?\u201c\u2026 I will\u201d\u201cMm-hmm. I\u2019ll wake you up when Raini or Ilia gets here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs urged by Anisphere, Uphilia closes her eyes and deposits herself entirely in Anisphere.Anispheric fingers feel comfortable on the body feeling tired. The temperature, the sound of the heartbeat, the familiar scent made the ship row to Uphilia\u2019s consciousness.Anisphere exhaled satisfactorily to Uphilia, who began to sleep quietly.The fatigue of the day seemed to wash away after dinner and an evening bath.I slowly dipped in the hot tub to untie my stiff body and had my hair wiped moisture. Either Raini or Ilia will bathe with you and take care of you when you enter the bathroom.If I went back to my bedroom without cooling my lit body, Anisphere, who had finished bathing in the water first, would have read the book and waited.After reigning queen, the bedrooms of Uphilia and Anisphere are in the same room. Because of the magic ingestion from Anisphere, Uphilia came to fruition with strong hope.\u201cAnis.\u201d\u201cMmm, Uffi. Up?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYes.\u201dWalking over to the Anisphere, which was sitting in the chair, Uphilia exchanges mouths just to peek into the face of the Anisphere and touch it.Even though it tickles, Anisphere never refuses. Close it with a pinch in the book of readings and stand up.\u201cCome.\u201dUphilia superimposes her own hand on the hand offered by Anisphere. Keep your hands together and head into the bed as the anisphere draws its hand.If you two lay down, hold Uphilia tight as she brings in the anisphere. Anisphere strokes her back as she loosens her cheeks just a little trouble with the clinging Uphilia.Ufiria reaches out to her neck and hair so that she can hold the anisphere and moves to tangle her legs. Lips are placed against exposed shoulders and cheeks, making sure to hold them as closely as possible.\u201cIt tickles, Uffi. He\u2019s totally sweet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a reward for your hard work.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well. Is the Queen in trouble after all?\u201cYes, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cOh well.\u201dAnisphere gives a slightly worried look as she strokes Uphilia\u2019s head. Daimyo, I think Uphilia won\u2019t settle for the status quo where she hasn\u2019t done anything in particular.\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201cNow, not yet. If it heals you like this, I don\u2019t want it now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ugh, that\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s the hard part, isn\u2019t it?\u201cIf anise is involved, it\u2019s going to get worse, so no.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying\u2026\u201dWith his hands on Annisphere\u2019s cheek, which he still tried to overlap, Uphilia exchanges her mouth to close Annisphere\u2019s words.When pecked repeatedly several times, Anisphere silences herself with a fuzzy face. The moist eyes rocked unreliably, and Uphilia licked her lips satisfactorily.\u201cFine, right?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I think it\u2019s sloppy\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t like to be sweet.\u201d\u201cI thought Uffi was definitely poorer at sweetening\u2026!\u201cI\u2019m just not sweet, when I\u2019m sweet, I\u2019m sweet, right?Especially to you, if you whisper in your ear, you will be completely powerless. Uphilia smiles as she strokes her completely silent Anispheric head okay.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not comfortable.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sick, it\u2019s\u201d\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. That\u2019s why I became queen to keep you from feeling that way.\u201dThere are few Anispheric jobs that do not even make me queen and have only nominal positions. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything completely, but if you look at people who keep busy every day, they look like they\u2019re in a hurry.But that\u2019s why Uphilia wanted Anisphere to rest. She keeps flying so far, she keeps flying too far away from other people and the world.\u201c\u2026 and\u201d\u201c? And?\u201c\u2026 if Anis gets hard and tired, he won\u2019t be able to get magic.\u201d\u201cHih.\u201dUphilia\u2019s fingers descend through the spine of the Anisphere. I felt something similar to chills and a strange voice leaked out of my mouth.Although Anisphere scorns Uphilia with resentment, Uphilia has never had the pleasure of just laughing like a prank.\u201cToday, I\u2019d like to have it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 on the way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201dNow, not yet.Do you still have resistance from shame, to the point of pecking? Someday.Hoping so, Uphilia layered her own lips on Anispheric lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: 75Today was the day and the day I was never chased.My task is primarily to supervise and advise. Review the compiled report to see if there are any problems and advise if necessary.But Yuffi told me not to do much except ask for advice. Let me think in the field first, and if there\u2019s still nothing I can do about it, I\u2019ll be counted on.If it were to be resolved with my advice, how could I have made such an idea? From what point of view did you see that advice come out? You think it\u2019s training to develop that kind of imagination?\u201cBut I\u2019m inspired, too.\u201dNow that magic has spread and is settling in. It\u2019s this country that\u2019s why the idea is starting to pop up. It would be Halfis walking at the head of it.Halphis\u2019 attempt to make fundamental improvements in magic and build a new generic technology system brings to mind images like programmers where they say they are in previous life.Updating and pioneering a technological system called magic. True, Halfis is one of those people who has been taught by me and is running through the cutting edge of the era. I hear she\u2019s busy every day because of that and she\u2019s about to turn her eyes.I think it\u2019s good to have such a full life. I envy you just a little.Well, I had nothing to do, so I was walking around the royal castle.The maids and knights in the royal palace laugh at me casually and give me a thank you. My odd eye for me has completely diminished already. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been making noisy noises lately either.I think the influence of working hastily within the Royal Castle to spread magic in the Ministry of Defense remains. It can be a bit unsettling for everyone to favor it.I was not comfortable with the favorable gaze and correspondence, and came to a lesser spot in the royal castle to avoid the eyes.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mm\u201dI turned my eyes round to the ancestors who were there. And it got awkward at the same time.The customer also has my eyes on me and what a subtle look.\u201c\u2026 Am I interrupting, son of Count Voltaire\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind Lang. Her Highness Sister Wang.\u201dLang Voltaire, a former Ministry of Magic elite who hated each other so much. Although he has now moved to the Ministry of the Spirit, its size had also been forced to shrink due to the division of roles.At the same time, his influence on politics was greatly reduced, which made him totally grown up. Even now, a short time ago, Lang was on the top of the Buddha, with a mixed grin of hostility.\u2026 It\u2019s also kind of awkward to walk away. We can\u2019t say anything to each other, only silence spreads.\u201c\u2026 turned into a ministry of spirits, how about it?Then I asked Lang that, unable to bear the silence.I don\u2019t hear a lot of rumors about the Spirit Ministry. I can\u2019t even see the movement. Every day, people say they are busy praying to the Spirit and compiling material from the past, so the topic doesn\u2019t come up prominently.Lang turns the gaze he was deviating from, just to the side. But it was also out of sight in an instant.\u201cI am surprised that Her Royal Highness Sister Wang is interested in the Ministry of the Spirit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I said\u2026. I\u2019m just wondering what the air is because I\u2019m not directly involved.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a generous man. He said he could care about the fate of those of us who once despised you\u2026\u201dI feel like I haven\u2019t seen a mocking, his-like grin in a long time. But it looks more like it\u2019s aimed at me than at me.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were doing something to be despised\u2026 now, I think\u201dTo my grunt, Lang came again at the gaze he had deviated from. Now it was my turn to get out of sight.\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t afford it either. This is how I can calmly talk to you now, but I don\u2019t think I was the one with the nose a while ago. Honestly, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have anywhere to think about it.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cSorry, you\u2019re having trouble reacting.\u201d\u201c\u2026 no\u201dI could see Lang shaking his neck left or right at the edge of his sight. Only silence passes without being able to leave the scene even though we remain out of sight of each other.\u201c\u2026 Did you propose the Ministry of the Spirit out of pity for us?\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say. Because I also found the truth about the Spirit Contract to be a drama drug. And the effect of publishing it. \u2026 so I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t feel sorry for you\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s also true that I want to take care of culture. It\u2019s not my intention to lose what I\u2019ve been piling up. Because it is definitely prayer and faith that has supported this country in its magic so far. But the only thing that makes me stick to it is\u2026 I think I\u2019m scared\u201dWhat if I wasn\u2019t here and the truth about the Spirit covenant wasn\u2019t revealed? I wonder what the hell was going on in the Kingdom of Palettia. Maybe he was repeating the tragedy of the first king.I think it\u2019s important to believe and think. But I\u2019m afraid to keep moving forward without being sure of anything. There may be a pit ahead.\u201c\u2026 I think I was scared\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you scared?\u201cI can\u2019t really use magic. It\u2019s something I can\u2019t handle for the rest of my life. Still couldn\u2019t give up. That\u2019s all I was in a hurry for.\u201dSo much so that I think that\u2019s what I was born for. I can\u2019t erase this longing for magic.So there was no way to admit the fact that I couldn\u2019t reach it. Fortunately, I had the knowledge to stay. That\u2019s why I kept running.\u201cIf I had accepted the idea of the Ministry of Magic at the time, my heart would have died. I\u2019m sure he was apathetic. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be alive, it doesn\u2019t have the role you were asked for. Then\u2026 I guess it\u2019s no different than being dead.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want to die pointless. I couldn\u2019t stay dead, even though there was an ideal that was going to be within reach.I didn\u2019t want to kill my heart, I turned away from what I tried to break my heart, turned away, and just stuck it in my shell. Only until it becomes a mask that sticks to itself.\u201c\u2026 what did I tell you about it? Was it unpleasant?\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s certainly a story that afflicts both understanding and empathy. But\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI think I should have understood sooner that you were suffering than I was suffering right now.\u201dI turned my eyes round to Lang\u2019s reply. I can\u2019t believe he said that.\u201cIt would be now. But now you think so. Still, I can\u2019t change the past. My fundamental, this idea is unwavering, too. \u2026 I still have no doubt about magic\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cBut to speak of that question\u2026 I, too, am still poorly understood. In that sense, we thank you for establishing the Ministry of the Spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t believe Lang thanked me. I couldn\u2019t think about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not why I accepted all the ideas of magic\u201dLang looks at me, but I can\u2019t feel the enemies I had before in those eyes.I just don\u2019t know how to deal with it, like I\u2019m lost. I feel such a quiet rejection.\u201cDon\u2019t accept it, I think it\u2019s good\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI also have that idea. Yes, I hope you admit it. That\u2019s all I need. Neither do I see magic as absolute. Because people are wrong creatures.\u201d\u201cWrong, is it\u2026\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYeah. No matter how hard you try, think, and desperately give an answer, you might go in the wrong direction. The world may not accept it. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\u201dI keep giving Lang one hand to ask him to shake his hand.Lang opens his eyes to gnaw and stares alternately at my hand and face.\u201cAt that time, I wish someone would stop me, forgive me for my mistakes, and correct me. That\u2019s why I want everyone to smile. People can share. I want it to be happier than unhappiness. To Lang, of course.\u201dPeople may be able to live alone. But it will be richer for both of us to live alone than to live alone.Even if we can\u2019t understand each other, we can live in the same world. Even if we just don\u2019t get involved with each other, I want the world to look happy in each one of us.Even if that\u2019s an unfulfilled picture. I don\u2019t want to think it was a mistake until I had that wish.\u201c\u2026 that was an interesting story. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me for this. Her Highness Sister Wang.\u201dLang looked at my hand jiggly but turned his back without taking my hand.I knew it was rejected. Distance opens with him completely turned his back. As it shows that this is the distance between him and me right now.I was dropping off Lang\u2019s back leaving like that. Until I can\u2019t see that back, just all the time.\u201cYou\u2019re round, too, Lang\u201d\u201c\u2026 Miguel? Peeping is a bad hobby.\u201dIt was Miguel who showed himself beside Lang at a distance out of Anisphere\u2019s sight. I have a smile that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking the same way.To Miguel\u2019s appearance like that, Lang puts his shoulders up and down in a daze and exhales and shows them. Miguel asks to slap him lightly, grinning deeper at how Lang looks like that.\u201cHow\u2019d it go? Why don\u2019t you talk to your current Royal Highness King Anisphere?\u201cHi, nothing\u2026. a difficult person to empathize with and understand. Line up your valves like a wise man as you speak your dreams like a child. \u2026 so much so that I think I\u2019m poisoned that I\u2019m finding profit there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s poisoned, hey. Isn\u2019t that the proof you walked away from?\u201c\u2026 now\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything better now. If you want to start over.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to say\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s another HR!Lang waves so depressingly that he can pay off Miguel. Miguel avoids it by taking a distance.Chip, and Lang\u2019s tongue hits zero. I snort all the same about saying I\u2019m an abominable man.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026. but I mean it? You\u2019re still young. You\u2019re not the same parent who\u2019s gonna make a big deal out of it with no more, are you?\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s none of your business\u201d\u201cNot directly. Just because I\u2019m Her Majesty\u2019s loyal servant? Thought I\u2019d behave like a loyalist?\u201c\u2026 Still don\u2019t like magic. I just think that dulls my faith in the Spirit. If you say, for example, that even if the Spirit has no will, it reflects his own heart. Can\u2019t say that no one thinks it\u2019s better to just use it by spreading magic?\u201cIf magic becomes just technology, nobility\u2019s absoluteness will be lost, eh?\u201c\u2026 yes\u201d\u201cRight. If magic, which can also be used by the civilian population, would be inevitable. A man with\u201c good thoughts of men \u201dlike His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere would be good. But His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere is not eternal.\u201dAnisphere has also defended its dangers because it has shown the most convenience in magic. And you look like Miguel, even as you\u2019re afraid.That is why drama drugs and anispheres are recognised by everyone. That\u2019s all there is to it. Even Uphilia, who is so close to Anisphere, has a verse that is cautious when it comes to its dangers.That\u2019s why now Anisphere is also a step from magic, a distance away. Rapid developments create distortions. Now is the time to incorporate the revolutionary ideas generated by Anisphere.For those who are inclined to the magic of the Anisphere, and for those who should be alarmed.\u201c\u2026 History tells, or\u201d\u201cRight. Manage past tragedies and mistakes not to be repeated in the future. That\u2019s one of your jobs, isn\u2019t it? Lang.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm. I always thought I didn\u2019t like it.\u201dI don\u2019t even want to be liked.Lang only tongues Miguel laughing at Kerakera again and goes down the road to the Spirit Ministry.Miguel loosens his mouth as he drops off his back.\u201cI wonder what will happen to this country from now on. We do not entrust it to the king alone, we do not merely attach it to faith. Thoughts, worries, each one chooses. Is that the beginning of innovation or just the opening of the chaos lid?\u201dNo one knows that yet. It will be the work of future generations to speak of the merits of those who live today.I just hope it\u2019s fun. And it would be nice if it was easier to work. Miguel thought so, moving in a different direction from Lang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76: 76That was sudden one day.I was irrationally attacked that day.\u201cThey\u2019ve been sparing time lately, haven\u2019t they? Anis.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201cI don\u2019t want to blunt my mind either. I\u2019ve been busy lately, and it\u2019s a good opportunity.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Mother?It was my mother who showed her flutter in the outhouse. If it\u2019s not my fault, what I\u2019m wearing is a war outfit, and I look like I have a spear in my hand.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s put on some archery for you. Anisphere.\u201dEven after time, my mother, named in the strongest corner, had a belligerent grin.The sound of cutting the wind passed right by. A blade avoided by trying to plunder, trying to take advantage of the momentum of the body falling as-is.Wind cutting sound again. Avoid by tilting your head at the back spear poke as you swirl. Even if you try to jump into your nose in a rebuilt position and get slashed, it doesn\u2019t hit your mother who dodges you with a slight appearance.The pattern of the spear presses to slap the brain sky all the time saying in return. Swing and play the celestial on top of it. Try to retreat after flying with each other to get a distance.Exhale the breath that had stopped me from doing too much. I couldn\u2019t help but scream as I felt the breath that would make me bitter.\u201cHow could you do this?\u201d\u201cTapping lightly is a lot to spare!\u201cI can\u2019t believe where I can afford it\u2026! Oh, unreasonable!Try to get a distance while playing the tip of an approaching spear at the Celestial. However, as the mother does not allow the distance to be separated, she rolls out the disturbance with one hand while packing the distance. No, fast, fast!?\u201cMana Shields!\u201dRaise one hand and deploy the magic barrier that was nestled in your arm to contain the spear. You can finally react even with physical enhancement, or the same thing\u2026!As I am bouncing back the disturbance poke with my final thoughts, I will now swap it between my hands and my mother will shake the spear out loudly.That spear shake out has the magic of the wind in it, and the gust blows out and blows my body. He manages to stretch the Celestial\u2019s magic blade and kill the momentum as he protrudes into the ground.\u201cHa\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u201cDidn\u2019t you lose strength? Anis.\u201dMother says in a sighing mix as she restarts her spear. I don\u2019t know where in my smaller body I have that power, I think I\u2019m going to lose my grip because my hand holding the celestial was paralyzed earlier!?Regardless, my mother is not a fool. The real top of my mother is the \u201cflow\u201d of wind magic. Every act of wind magic plays an accelerating role, knocking on wasteless power.This is the strength of Mother, Sylphine Mays Palettia. To be clear, I can\u2019t make it in time. The storm of the whole offensive, if I were to speak truly of my mother, would be such an expression.\u201cYou still seem relaxed. Certainly, magic is worth your life, and right now, there\u2019s no other way for you to get out of it than to be distracted if you\u2019re not directly involved.\u201d\u201cNo, you know what, Mother\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t admit to being lazy, etc! That sexual root, beat me back once now!!\u201dWill you stop proclaiming with a happy grin!?Ignore my screams and my mother will come towards me. The moment you kick the ground, you stick out a spear that weighs all over your body with acceleration by the wind. Replace the position so that it is not rubbed against the mother as she plays away from the tip of the ear.Mother, who gained momentum, stayed put, as if she had risen to the sky with a stick-high flying guideline, \u201ckicking\u201d through the air and coming towards me. Defend with a Celestial to cope with a sudden and sudden change. Stop acting so strange!?If Yufi is an all-powerful wizard capable of handling a wide variety of magic, her mother has reached the ultimate in wind magic.Honestly, I want to despair even though the strength that has always been unreasonable is still bouncing since such a mother recently touched on the concept of \u201cflight\u201d.Originally, Mother\u2019s style is a crystal of technology that integrates the flow of wind magic with the movement of weapons. I recently captured a magic concept from flying magic know-how.What the hell is this mother trying to fight? Wouldn\u2019t this guy be able to take down the dragon by himself?\u201cI don\u2019t mean because I\u2019m lazy, you just wanted to try this!?\u201d\u201cCome on, what is it?I rebuild my celestial even though I am frightened of my mother, who smiles at me no.Because it\u2019s about my mother, I know I\u2019m prepared for it, but it could break my bones. I was wrapped up in such grandeur.\u201cNevertheless, that weapon is good\u2026\u2026 would you like me to make a dedicated spear too?\u201cHa, what do you do when you\u2019re stronger than this?\u201cThis is still the end of the samurai, right?\u201cI\u2019m not a samurai!?\u201dThen I was wondering if you could invite someone from the Knights or something, not me!?In the end, even after that, I continued my archery with my mother and got bogged down. Long reach, fast movement, unstoppable, too quick to react. Oh, my God, my mother is a monster after all!\u201cUgh\u2026 I had a terrible eye\u201d\u201cBecause you live a lazy life. I won\u2019t allow you to be lazy.\u201dAfter my mother\u2019s audition, I was having tea with my mother in the corner of the garden. I\u2019m sitting in a chair, but my whole body is pounding and it hurts.I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a muscle ache tomorrow, I\u2019m not sure. Sure, I haven\u2019t gotten into a lot lately because I\u2019ve been losing my mind.\u2026 Well, I just regret it a bit. I think I need to work this out again.\u201cAnd yet\u2026 you\u2019re stuck\u201dI turn my gaze to the garden and squeal. I don\u2019t usually take trips to the garden because I\u2019m stuck in the outhouse.My father had recently begun to sew between errands and landscaping. Right now, we\u2019re enjoying our tea in our father\u2019s private space, the corner where he got it.I can still see my father checking on the flowers and the landscape. I tried to come after the audition to have a tea party with my parents and kids, but there was a bitter smile on my father who was messing with us.\u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re investing in magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ha, no way\u201dI deny it with my mouth and show it, but I can\u2019t deny it a bit. I didn\u2019t want to find anything in common there. My father was a researcher, too.I\u2019ve heard that you like to mess with dirt for a long time. There were so many things that I had to inherit my country, and I couldn\u2019t rest until I gave up my throne.Even though it assists Uffi, the aid is only an aid. Released from the heavy duty of king, Father was as if to regain his youth. I still love flowers in a lively way.\u201c\u2026 you make me a little jealous\u201dPompous, my mother narrowed her eyes and shrugged. Unexpectedly a chill runs and holds my two arms down.\u201cEven your mother is jealous\u2026\u201d\u201cI will. Especially if he asks you which is more important: flowers or me?\u201cHuh? Your father loves that mother?Even though it\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re usually trying not to show it, or if it\u2019s a lit up cover, you\u2019re drowning your mother?Then my mother looked at me with her eyes like she saw something subtle.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think you want to tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why?\u201cUfi or magic, which is more important?I accidentally got stuck in words. He drinks it up before he blows it out, spitefully suppressing that he\u2019s about to blow out the tea he drank.Do you say that either is important, that neither is important and that I can\u2019t give you superiority or inferiority, or that I\u2019m not honest about lying, but I love Yufi, but I can\u2019t throw away magic\u2026\u201cLook, look.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even argue with you. There\u2019s no gu noise either.\u201cThis is how I like to leave me alone and play dirt. Be careful now, Anis.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dI\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s mad at me just because he\u2019s my father\u2026 but I remember him, so I feel like I shouldn\u2019t argue with him.Then, my mother laughed out couscous.\u201cIf you look at it this way, Annis and Orphans look alike.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026 is that right?Does your father and I look alike?\u2026 but I never thought about that when I was told again.\u201cSomehow you like people who can\u2019t abandon you. I tend to pull into my world. And being honest with people you like is bad, huh?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 object\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s room, there\u2019s room.\u201d\u2026 I didn\u2019t admit it, but even if I strongly deny it here, I will admit that I think so\u2026!\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give Yuffi some proper sweetness, aren\u2019t you?\u201cThat\u2019s what my mother cares\u2026!\u201cIt\u2019s about the family. And Yuffi is carrying the burden of a queen? It\u2019ll crumble if you don\u2019t sweeten it so you don\u2019t care how much you stand and spoil it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know that,\u201dIt\u2019s good to spoil it, isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s sweet\u2026 maybe I\u2019m not good at it.Then my mother smiled somewhere she seemed lonely. Gently return to the saucer as you peer through the edges of the teacup.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault you make me look like that.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why\u2026!\u201cAll I could do was talk loudly and treat you harshly when I met you. I fully understand that it is now time for me to teach you to be sweet to someone like that. And you\u2019re not going to blame me. I\u2019m getting sweet.\u201d\u201cThen be sweet enough. Me or your father. First, they\u2019re carrying too much. You should have treated me a little more.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d say the child in question should be\u2026?\u201cUgh.\u201dI don\u2019t deny that you\u2019re a problem child. Yes, it\u2019s my fault for the hard work! Yes, yes, I\u2019m bad, I\u2019m bad!\u201c\u2026 but I wish I\u2019d done this sooner\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of brother was Algardo to you? Anis.\u201dI didn\u2019t think your mother would give you Al\u2019s name, and I opened my eyes to a little surprise.Since then, Al-Kun\u2019s name has been like a taboo between us. The story of Al Kun, who has been abandoned and flown out of the public and into a remote place, is a heartbreaking topic for everyone.\u201c\u2026 he was a pretty little brother. You used to be weak, didn\u2019t you? About my back, following my very own, getting angry and teary-eyed together\u2026\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t protect Al. I couldn\u2019t protect him, and I didn\u2019t try to. So I was hoping that Al could take everyone\u2019s hand and push them out to whoever they wanted. I still want Al to be king.\u201dEven now that Yufi is king, I don\u2019t know if Al-Kun is king.I didn\u2019t want Uffi next door, but if they were, those two would have been kings and queens.That\u2019s what I might have liked to see. Though I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with me then.\u201cYou don\u2019t think Algardo has talent?\u201cI don\u2019t. But\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have seen it that way. Someone had to believe Al. In fact, Al has become so much a vampire. I\u2019ve gained strength, work hard, work hard, spit blood back.\u201dAl doesn\u2019t have the talent to glow. I still can\u2019t deny that. But I don\u2019t even think that was right.However, as a result, he could have gone as far as a step ahead of ruling the country without me anyway.The means were just unacceptable, and Al-Kun went up there. That\u2019s all I can\u2019t deny, and I don\u2019t think I should deny it.\u201c\u2026 if there is magic in al-kun\u2019s hands\u201dIf I had taken al-kun\u2019s hand instead of wanting extraneous power.Oh, I thought about that. Then maybe there was a better future than now.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say now. That possibility didn\u2019t take shape.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t even regret it\u2026. Ha, we, our parents, were short on words. That pointer really hurts my ears right now\u2026\u201dMy mother exhales deeply. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never exchanged words with my mother. I was looking forward to hearing about other countries\u2019 landscapes and cultures.There were just no words to exchange hearts there. There was only a conversation, like a duty to each other, between the upper side of the interaction. Just ask for what it should be, look for it, and fit it in.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s not going to happen, and we\u2019re going to have to start over. Little by little, even if you can\u2019t get it back, to build up more than that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right\u201dGetting the ideal time is like a dream that can no longer be fulfilled.Still don\u2019t think I want to forget. Dreaming like that. I don\u2019t want to do anything that didn\u2019t come true anymore, even if it\u2019s a further wish.My father was so enthusiastic about the dirt, my mother bawled, and I swung at it. There, Al, who became king, sees between them and calls out.And have a tea party with my family. I closed my eyes softly, visioning such an unfulfilled dream.(Al, how are you?)I want you to forgive me as much as I pray. I want you to miss it if you just wish.At least now, I need to make sure I don\u2019t let go of just what\u2019s left of my hand.I exhaled softly as I looked at my mother\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: 77\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m finally done for today\u2026\u201dDisappointed, it was Halfis who drowned on his desk to burn out.In the past, having been treated coldly from around her as an incomparable Viscount Lady, she can be said to have emerged unparalleled.Halphis is a direct disciple of Anisphere and Uphilia, since it was divided from the former Ministry of Magic and transformed into a Ministry of Magic that pushes for the study of magic and magic.There is no reason why she doesn\u2019t give her status in the Ministry of Magic and Sciences, and she works hard with overwork every day while responding to the unscrupulous gestures from Uphilia.\u201cMmm, mmm\u2026 Dear Uphilia, I\u2019m too unscrupulous\u2026 it\u2019s time for the boulder to exceed my processing capacity\u2026\u201dHalfis is never incompetent. Rather, the diligent nature could be said to be talented enough to push forward an understanding of magic that could be described as a new discipline, and the guts cultivated and the speed of rotation of the natural head because of the long period of cold treatment can be said to be commendable.Indeed, the magic arm did not change dramatically where magic was introduced. As a wizard, Halfis would be quicker to count from below. The problem is the environment where she can\u2019t show her true worth until now, and she now acts like a fish who got water.But that\u2019s why if you come down without a break from work, there are limits to how Halfis can be described as a talented woman in this field. And what she was having trouble with in her current position was her position.\u201cAfter all, if you\u2019re a Viscount Lady, you\u2019re worried about the eyes of the elderly\u2026\u201dHa, and the exhaled sigh dissolves in the universe and disappears.The Nebles, the house of Halphis, are the Viscounts. Its status is inferior when viewed as aristocratic.No matter how capable Halphis is, the people who support Halphis are much older than Halphis in terms of age and title.That\u2019s not why someone stands out and says something to Halfis. Still, it was under heavy pressure for Halfis. Originally, Halfis is not a man of conscience.\u201c\u2026 tired\u201dLeave your back on the back of the chair and exhale several sighs as you place your back of your hand to cover your eyes.That\u2019s when I heard the sound of knocking on Halphis\u2019 office. Halfis immediately corrects his posture and turns his gaze to the door.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cGood day, Halfis\u201d\u201cDear Marion!?\u201dIt was Marion who came into Halfis\u2019 office. Halfis touches the sudden appearance of his fianc\u00e9e if his forehead is not disturbed aggressively.Halfis and Marion both have seats in the Ministry of Magic. However, because the departments in charge are different, they do not meet each other on a daily basis. In order not to confuse the public and private sectors, they rarely looked at each other in the Ministry of Magic.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Dear Marion.\u201d\u201cAh. Actually, you had to talk to Halfis\u2026 it\u2019s hard to decide just because of my presence\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?Halfis groans with an unexpected frown. Recently, my busyness is just swelling up and bothering my head, so I get a hypersensitive reaction.Marion scratched her back of the head with her hands as she said to Halfis like that.\u201cI\u2019m in trouble, I\u2019m in trouble. But I can\u2019t say enough bad stories. I\u2019m confused myself\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI was wondering how you cut it out\u2026\u2026 Halfis\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhen we talk about you marrying the Count Anti family\u2026 what do you think?\u201c\u2026 Yes?Halfis blinked at the words from Marion, which he hadn\u2019t thought of.So you\u2019re here to talk to me because you can\u2019t make your own decisions?\u201cSorry, Dear Anisphere\u2026\u201d\u201cI, myself, wanted you to consult me\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, I received a report from Halfis asking if I could get some time because I had a consultation, and I immediately called the two of them out of the palace through Ilaria.I\u2019m not that busy right now. If Halfis and Marion were in trouble, I wanted to talk to them. If it\u2019s true, I wish Yufi was there, but you\u2019re still busy today. It\u2019s late to go home.\u201cUh, I mean, Marion was supposed to inherit where your brother would inherit the house? That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, right?\u201cYes, my brother would have inherited the Count Anti family if it had been.\u201dYes. It was the home situation of the Count Anti family, Marion\u2019s house, that was bothering the two of them.Marion was originally scheduled to enter the Viscount Nebles family in Halfis, the fianc\u00e9e whose parents had decided on each other.\u201cYour brother\u2019s from the former Ministry of Magic, too?\u201cYes, I am now transferring to the Ministry of the Spirit\u201d\u201cWhy is that giving up the Lord to Marion again?\u201cMy brother said it out. Because I am more kind to the royal family. He said it would be better for Count Anti to welcome Halfis there as his wife.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say, but I don\u2019t.The two, Marion and Halfis, can also be described in a way as direct disciples of me and Uffi.If those two are going to be the next Counts, that may be desirable as a home. It means you can be kind to the royal family.\u201cBut your brother was originally going to inherit, wasn\u2019t he? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s for Halfis. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u201cHalfis\u2019s?\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfis is shrinking small, frowning like he\u2019s in trouble.Marion continues to sigh with his hands around Halfis shoulders like that.\u201cHalfis is currently no exaggeration when it comes to executive roles in the Ministry of Magic. But Halphis is still young. And the status is not commensurate with the position of the Viscount. I was wondering if it would be better to welcome a former Magic Ministry elite into our home.\u201d\u201cYour brother mentioned that?\u201cMy brother was in a neutral position in the former Ministry of Magic, but he was still a serious believer in the Spirit Faith. Even if I don\u2019t deny magic, I still have a lot to eat. Instead, I want to do research and organize materials in the spiritual ministry and get off the surface stage, and I\u2019m smiled out\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay, you\u2019re the next winner, right?\u201cMe too\u2026 Honestly, I have a bit of a headache\u2026\u201dExhales softly as Marion holds his temples.\u201cI\u2019m never saying it without thinking about it, either, brother. It\u2019s out of the house where my older brother was planning to welcome his fianc\u00e9e into the spiritual faith. I\u2019ve lost quite a bit of my place in this one\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re good friends, but I\u2019m the one who got in trouble here.\u201d\u201cMarion is the closest thing to the royal family right now, and your brother feels I\u2019m not good at one way or another?\u201cAnd Her Majesty Queen Uphilia, too, right? It\u2019s a good edge for the house, so he insisted it would be better to stand there. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s maid also once said that it would be weird to marry the Count Anti family in the present circumstances anyway\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s also a convincing story about how Marion is going to be in trouble again.Although I and Uffi cause it to make me look subtle too. Your brother must have felt safe to inherit if we hadn\u2019t been flashy.\u201cWhat would your brother do if he didn\u2019t inherit the house?\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m leaving the house. For once, he says he\u2019ll only leave his name\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t even inherit territory, does it? If the income was from the Ministry of Spirits, you\u2019d get a good salary\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going into your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house as a son-in-law, does it?\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dHmm, what a bad sitting story.If that happens. Furthermore, Marion\u2019s brother has no territory to inherit, assuming he has a child. This becomes suspicious if you are only the son of a nobleman and your position as a nobleman is guaranteed unless some brother can also stand for merit.If you do not inherit territory, or if you do not succeed and inherit that status from your parents, etc., your child will no longer have a status as a nobleman. In other words, it becomes a child who is a nobleman\u2019s child but has nothing to inherit as a nobleman.Because noble sons of these troublesome positions are neglected. Nobility is a creature who cares terribly about face to face and his place. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so thriving to marry or enter the other person\u2019s house if you can\u2019t stand that\u2026\u201cThen, as planned, I told Viscount Nebles that it would be better if I joined him as my son-in-law, but in our position, the Viscount or something would be wrong, my brother told me\u2026\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cI wanted to come up with an answer after a solid thought, but in fact there are many aristocrats who want to bring the fringe to Halfis\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 do you have that problem too\u2026\u201d\u201cMy father also said that as soon as this story was decided, I would give up my Lord\u2019s seat. Whether that\u2019s me or my brother. I already said that I am powerless to take the stage\u2026 and if I have the status, I can keep my voice even if I am a young man. That doesn\u2019t change either my brother or me. When my mother accompanies my father\u2019s will\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 as good as it gets\u201dI think and look with my arms around me. How do I solve this situation?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.First, Marion takes the lead and welcomes Halfis as his wife. The reason for this is to set the house up by standing up with the current royal family, that is, me and Uffi, who have a strong relationship.The problem is Marion\u2019s brother\u2019s position, which he was supposed to inherit. If you\u2019re going to leave the house convinced, including your fianc\u00e9e, then there doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem.If my parents are convinced, Marion doesn\u2019t have a problem. If there\u2019s a problem, is it Halphis?\u201cHave you told Halfis\u2019 parents this story?\u201cLooks like it was already done. When I\u2019m married, the Viscount Nebles have no heirs\u2026 so if I don\u2019t have an adopted son to see, I\u2019ll give him back his status, too. Originally, there was nothing to worry about because it was a family of knights.\u201d\u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t rubbed both my parents and my house. I guess the rest depends on how you two feel.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes, you will\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess I\u2019m good then, huh?If Halfis is attracted to her current position, I think it would be a good thing to get the status of Countess. It would be one beauty to say that Marion, who married Halfis, continued to protect the ever cold-treated Halfis.If Halfis is capable of demonstrating his abilities to the fullest, then I welcome both Uffi and I with all our hands. Halfis is a direct disciple after all, but I think it\u2019s a good thing if you need him in a position to work hard.\u201cI appreciate Halfis, and I\u2019m counting on Marion. I wouldn\u2019t be happier if the two of you would serve as the Count Anti family, not personally. But even Yuffi would want a supportive talent, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cIt is true that the disappearance of traces from the Viscount Nebles family also annoys all sorts of people, starting with Marion\u2019s brother, who was supposed to be the owner of the Count family. Even the two of you know that makes me feel uncomfortable. That\u2019s all the trouble, and you\u2019re worried about whether we can really do it.\u201dWhen I said that, the two men looked down together.Good conditions. And then they say it depends on how they feel, and I think there\u2019s a lack of confidence in me that these two can\u2019t be instantly executed. Halfis out of anxiety for himself, Marion out of the pressure of expectations from around him. I think the specific gravity is different.Two distressed people threw their voices from my back. That was Ilia listening to the conversation in silence.\u201cI support it, too\u201d\u201cIlia\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help you both empathize with your troubles. I just have one thing. I support it because that is in the interest of Master Anisphere and Master Uphilia. Your power will certainly help you both. So I can\u2019t help but hope that you can use that help.\u201dIn the wake of Ilia\u2019s words, the two men, who had slightly let their faces lie down, raise their faces.Halfis and Marion, stared at the two faces again before I continued to take over Ilia\u2019s words.\u201cYou should just bother me. They\u2019re expecting you, you two. But I\u2019m not sure I have to live up to that expectation. Because Halphis, Halphis is more confident he can succeed than I am?\u201cWhat!? Well, I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can\u201d\u201cThen you can count on me. I\u2019m a little hard without Halfis and the others. I just need Halfis and the others to help me. I don\u2019t think I said anything difficult. He listens, he thinks and moves for us. That\u2019s all I need. Then I\u2019ll help you both. Just like you wanted to teach magic, right?I don\u2019t think we have to carry the responsibility of carrying the house alone.I could certainly cause a lot of trouble to my family. But I don\u2019t think even the two families would suggest that it\u2019s just to their detriment.\u201cBesides, it could certainly bother you now. But you just have to grow up ahead and give it back as much as you can with it. Because we have a future as expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anisphere\u201dThat\u2019s right. I, too, don\u2019t expect Halphis from anyone anymore, not just to be treated cold.Maybe not right now. It may take some time. But it\u2019s not a situation where you can\u2019t even hope for help around you.I\u2019m here now because I\u2019ve had the edge I\u2019ve been connected to. That took me a while to sprout, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have to be pessimistic.I think there is anxiety. I also think it\u2019s natural to worry about it. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll ever succeed. Still, I had words I wanted to give to both of you.\u201cI\u2019m sure Halfis and Marion will be fine. I can believe that.\u201dThat was my heartfelt word.The two of you will remain silent in my words. It was Marion who opened his mouth first.\u201cThank you, Sister King Anisphere. \u2026 I\u2019m going to be ready, too\u201d\u201cMaster Marion?\u201cHalphis.\u201dMarion deflects her gaze from me and turns back to Halfis. Seeing that serious look, it also calms Halfis\u2019 expression, which was puzzling.Marion gently holds both hands of Halfis. Hold Halfis\u2019 hand so that Marion\u2019s hands envelop him, and Marion and Halfis face each other head-on.\u201cLet\u2019s get married, Halfis. I want you to set up the Anti family with me. I want to support you now. I want to use it if I have something I can use for it. I\u2019m ready now.\u201d\u201cDear Marion\u2026\u201d\u201cI still think it would be a good idea for me to go to the Viscount Nebles house as my son-in-law if I were to round it up. But if the position of Viscount Lady is going to make Halfis uncomfortable, I want to push your back. If I can gain the strength to protect you, push my brother away, but I want to be in charge.\u201dTo Marion\u2019s upright words, Halfis gazes aside.Halfis squeezed his expression after he looked at me, wandering his gaze to get lost in something.Turning again to Marion, Halfis smiled slightly.\u201c\u2026 Honestly, things changed and I was confused and wondering if I could really stay like this. I\u2019m just a Viscount Lady, and a while ago I was told I was falling. There\u2019s really nothing to be proud of\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but right now, I\u2019m working very hard. I think I\u2019m going to like myself. It was so fun and fulfilling. So, so, Master Marion. Can I try my best? I want to be the kind of person who can be recognized by me and all around me.\u201dOh, of course.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s me, okay?\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of anything but you.\u201dIn response to Marion\u2019s words, Halfis turned bright red in his face.I look out, and I wonder how I reacted. Then I look at Ilia. He got his index finger up and winked like a prank.Unusual, I also returned the wink and took my index finger to my mouth.The two of them came back from their own world until Yufi came back out of the palace and rounded their eyes on how they were doing. Until then, they had been holding hands together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: 78The world was created by light and darkness. Light leads, the world is enriched by fire, earth, water and wind, and invited to sleep by darkness. And the light will again evoke the world after the sleep of rest, and the world will tour the time of the year.Today was the end of the year, and the year was about to end. the end of the year and a day to celebrate a new year. The day at the end of the year in the Kingdom of Palletia is set to be a day to heal the fatigue of the year.It is the teachings of the Spirit Faith that the Spirit of Darkness, who presides over the moon at the end of the year, is accompanied by the symbol of the sleep of rest, and that the Spirit of Light, the symbol of the first moon to celebrate the New Year, begins the New Year by interacting with the Spirit of Darkness.At the end of the year, most people will spend their holidays without even working. There is no reason to remove the Royal Castle security or anything like that. Still less personnel than usual, no usual noise, quiet.On this day, I was not uncommonly away from the palace but in the royal castle. Rubbing off. Everyone looked strange when they looked at me, but I rubbed off with them just to make a light meeting.\u201c\u2026 Well, they think it\u2019s unusual for me to wander the royal castle on this day\u201dWhatever it is, it\u2019s the end of the year on top of not leaning on the Royal Castle. That said, it wasn\u2019t until last year that I didn\u2019t lean on the royal castle.This year, Father withdrew and Yufi took over as queen. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that it is truly a year of change. With this transformation, my position has changed dramatically.Maybe that\u2019s why. I somehow wanted to visit the royal castle on this day. Because I thought if I was wandering around the royal castle today, it wouldn\u2019t bother me very much.\u201c\u2026 Ah, here\u201dSecond, stop the leg. It was a staircase there. Nothing. It\u2019s a staircase with no weirdness whatsoever, but it\u2019s a staircase with a few memories for me.\u201cYou failed to fly like musty with a sheet from here\u201dWhimpering small as he strokes the handrails of the stairs. That was when I was just a little girl.Memories of a time when I still didn\u2019t make a difference with Al Kun and Ilia and I didn\u2019t have a relationship like we do now. Memories of borrowing sheets like musty and trying to glide through the sky using the Spirit Stone of the Wind. After that, naturally, Ilia caught me up in it, and my father pissed me off, too.\u201c\u2026 I miss you\u201dStill before I left the royal castle, before I pulled into a cage away from the palace, everything about the royal castle was my playground.Yes, I visited the royal castle on this day because I wanted to miss the memories of the past.If it\u2019s the number of memories, it\u2019s more memories in the outhouse. Besides, the memories at the Royal Castle were honest, more memories of hard feelings if you remember.\u201c\u2026 because Al was there.\u201dThe memories I had at the Royal Castle were also those I had with Al Kun at the same time. It was an unrecoverable past for me, with the pain of being able to poke my mistakes.After Al-Kun left, he was often seen with strange eyes if he showed his face to the royal castle. I\u2019m sure you just don\u2019t realize it, and I think you\u2019ve been looking at me like that for a long time.\u201c\u2026 Al, you used to be a crybaby\u201dWhen we were still playing together, Al was a crybaby, somewhere inside, timid. But he was a sweet girl who followed me.I\u2019ve never resented you. I\u2019ve thought I was jealous, but I\u2019ve never thought I was jealous. Just loving, cute, old me just innocently adoring Al Kun.\u201cIlia was more pointy back then than she is now.\u201dIlia had a harder attitude than she is now when we met. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have to ask him if he\u2019s settled down over the years, or if it\u2019s because the environment has changed.Since that time, Ilia has often been attached to us as our go-to actor, and I can\u2019t believe how angry Ilia was at you for making a scene with Al.He just said he misses it. The pain didn\u2019t go away when I remembered. Since Al Kun left the royal castle, if I remember Al Kun, all I regret is soliciting. Still, the pain was relieved to such an extent that I could immerse myself in the memories.I ascend the stairs and slowly go through the royal castle. One, one, make sure you have a place to remember.\u201c\u2026 Ah, my room\u201dAs I walked, I found my room before moving to the outhouse. I tried my hand on the door, but it was locked tightly and I couldn\u2019t get inside.Looks like this room hasn\u2019t been used since I left. I crawl my fingers at a door that won\u2019t open and try to gently cling my forehead to the door.\u201c\u2026 the day you popped out of this room was the beginning of it all.\u201dYeah, I was definitely looking up at the sky that day. I can\u2019t believe I could fly through the sky. I got the hang of being who I am now, like a puzzle fitted in.And I popped out of this room. This unopened door made me laugh somewhat bitterly because it seemed to show myself before that day when I could never go back.\u201cAnis? What are you doing\u201d\u201cMother?\u201dWell, if I could hear your voice and look at it, my mother would have been there. It was a lightweight dress today, and it was an off look.I have three red hair wrapped around my braids that reach up to my waist, and the blue eyes that usually make me feel intelligent look strange or suspiciously at me.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual for you to come here\u2026 what the hell?This is a royal neighbourhood. Naturally, besides my room, there are also my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s rooms. So it\u2019s not surprising that you have a mother. Rather, it\u2019s unnatural for me to be here.I tried to answer your mother\u2019s question, but I couldn\u2019t get the word out. Just staring at my mother, my mother frowned suspiciously.\u201c\u2026 anise?Mother calling my name, it sounds like that voice blamed me again for being even malicious.I don\u2019t care about such a mother\u2019s call, I approach her softly. And I held my mother tight.\u201cYikes!? What is it? Anis, why are you suddenly holding me?My mother seemed confused when suddenly it was unexpected that I hugged her.Is it the scent of fragrance oil? The scent I feel from my mother makes me snort. Keep it up. I keep holding my mother to a point where she\u2019s not bitter.\u201c\u2026 anise?Then my mother\u2019s voice turned into some worrying voice. I missed that voice sexually for some reason. Distracted memories are long before I can recover my memories from my previous life.Even my mother was just a sweet mother before I started behaving in a ruinous way. Gentle, warm. Though irritating, the memory did breathe in me.(\u2026 Oh, good. You still remember properly, I)My mother\u2019s memory, which was just so sweet. Confirming that I do have that memory in me, I hold my mother in my arms with the thoughts that come up in my chest.\u201c\u2026 hehe, suddenly excuse me! Bye!\u201d\u201c\u2026 what? Oh, come on, wait, Anis!My mother kept me in her arms as confused, but I suddenly get embarrassed. I immediately release my mother and run out with my back slightly turned.My mother, distracted by my sudden oddity, is still yelling at me to blame if she sees me rushing.Try to escape my mother\u2019s wrath. I will run through the royal castle. No matter how many times I was pissed off, I never stopped. This is how I kept running when I ran away from the samurai and the knights and when I found what I wanted to do.Run, run. Just run. I was out on the roof of the royal castle.\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Empty.Naturally, if you go out on the roof, there\u2019s a sky in front of you.I walk up to the edge of the roof looking up at the sky. Put your hand on the handrail and just keep looking up at the sky.Today\u2019s sky was a clear blue sky. I could see the white clouds slowly changing to stretch out into the wind.\u201c-\u2026 ah\u201dThe clouds are stretching uninterrupted. No matter how thin it gets, it\u2019s going to fog off the tail and disappear.If I had such thoughts about the shape of the clouds, I would have an urge on my chest to scream. I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what the emotion was.Reach out to the clear blue sky. Like stretching your back and trying to get you to the unreachable sky.\u2013 Someone\u2019s hand overlapped my hand stretched out into that sky.\u201c\u2026 what are you doing, Anis\u201d\u201cUfi.\u201dI kind of opened my eyes and looked at Uffi. That, I didn\u2019t notice any signs\u2026?As I look at Uffi in wonder, he exhales like Uffi was frightened and makes me hold the hand that was stretching out into my sky and lower it.\u201cMy mother-in-law told me something was wrong with Anise, so I came looking for her.\u201d\u201cMy mother?\u201cYep\u2026. I thought you found it, it was the sky up there. Unaware of me.\u201dWas I looking at the sky so much as eating in? That\u2019s a bit of a failure.When it was kind of awkward, Yufi put her strength into my gripping hand. It\u2019s a lover connection that entangles your fingers. I feel the heat coming up on my cheeks in that grip.\u201c- Where were you looking?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But Yufi\u2019s voice seemed anxious somewhere. I noticed that Yuffi\u2019s eyes were shaking anxiously.\u201cUh\u2026 did I make you worry?\u201cAnyone will worry if things go wrong\u2026. it was as if they were going to suck into the sky, the anise earlier\u201d\u201cSucked into the sky, or\u201dFrom Yufi\u2019s point of view, I felt like I was in danger or something. And maybe even to my mother. That\u2019s the same thing, all of a sudden he hugged me and ran away without saying anything.\u2026 I have a sense that I was a little floating myself. That\u2019s also because the day at the end of this year was special.\u201c\u2026 somehow, I wanted to look back\u201d\u201cLooking back?\u201d\u201cTell me about the life you\u2019ve lived to this day\u2026. I wonder how it would feel to be here in the royal castle now. Because memories of the Imperial Castle are now painful to remember.\u201d\u201c\u2026 anise\u201dHe strengthened his power to hold my hand as Yufi called out worryingly.The heat of the hand being gripped is transmitted to me. It was as if the heat would tell me I was here.\u201cI\u2019m not out of pain. But it didn\u2019t get hard to remember. Even though I thought it was something I left behind, I thought it was my own. I could confirm that. I used to be so adorable to my mother.\u201d\u201c\u2026 even now, if it\u2019s properly sweet, you\u2019ll be adored. Mother-in-law.\u201d\u201c\u2026 in a workout sense?\u201cNormally it means being a parent and a child.\u201dI wonder. Somehow, because I feel loved, but my mother is not honest. You\u2019re going to end up in the dark and be brought into the workout, aren\u2019t you?When I was thinking about something my mother would definitely do if she found out, Yufi was packing a distance so that she could peek into my eyes. The heart beat just a little faster at a distance that seemed to take each other\u2019s exhales.\u201c\u2026 in the sky\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat memories do you have in the sky?Uffi inquires as he stares me straight in the eye. I suspect it was my illusion that the inquiry sounded true.But because Yuffi\u2019s hand is going to hold my hand stronger than just now\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably my fault. I feel like they\u2019re worried about me being gone from here.\u201c\u2026 not here. Somewhere, the wizard said he could fly.\u201dYufi\u2019s eyebrows came to mind. I smile bitterly at Uffi for reacting to what I thought.You didn\u2019t like the fact that I laughed bitterly, and Yufi gave me a light-headed thrust with a muffled face. A small pain spreads to my forehead.As he groaned lightly at the pain, Uffi asked, lurking his voice.\u201c\u2026 in a previous life?\u201cYeah. In the sky, because I admired and remembered\u201dOff his gaze from Uffi, he turns his attention to the sprawling blue sky. What color would the sky have been on that day when I remembered?\u201cAfter remembering my memories of my previous life, I became who I am now. Not here. Because I remember the view. So the sky really made me want to fly. From the day I thought I could fly the sky myself in this world with magic. But I also know that I wasn\u2019t gone until then.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really? Isn\u2019t Annis suffering now?\u201cOf course it is.\u201dMemories of previous life. What was given to me was some landscape, not this world. I remember living there. A bunch of useful tools not found in this world and the magic and longing for the sky to be intense.My longing for the sky and magic is the same thing in the end. I want to realize a dream that\u2019s not supposed to come true, I want to fly magically free through the sky. It\u2019s on your own volition, too.So I keep admiring magic. Previously, and always will. The next time I fulfill my dream of flying, I want to go for more magical possibilities.\u201cTo be honest, there were some tough times. Especially when I had an affair with Al. I sometimes wondered why I remembered such a memory. But now\u2026 this is good.\u201d\u201cThis is good, is it?\u201cCurses and blessings are all about paper. This must be a gift from me in my previous life. You\u2019re free to live in this world! It seems that way now.\u201dI pursued magic so that it could be pushed and moved, first and foremost because I definitely remembered the memories of my previous life and was born into admiration.Still, I was not given the miracle of magic. Did you lose it because I remembered it, or didn\u2019t you originally have talent? Though I don\u2019t know that.The certainty is that I was given this memory of my previous life to find my way. I was able to run to my samurai. And I could make my dreams come true. So the memory that this curse and blessing is a piece of paper can be a blessing.\u201cWith Uffi as queen and magic recognized, I thought I\u2019d look back on this past year for the rest of my life. Make sure one at a time, because I thought I was happy.\u201dUntil now, it\u2019s just been a few days since the end of the year. I have nothing to think about. It was a day the same as usual, just moving towards the ideals I wanted to reach.Because I could only breathe by moving on. But now it\u2019s a little slow. But I can breathe looking back. I was able to accept myself.So \u2013 I thought it was happiness.\u201cI\u2019m so happy right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dYuffi\u2019s worried face finally turned into a smile. With my hand in his hand, Yufi pulls his arm and snuggles up with me.I leave myself to Uffi without resisting either. We mouth each other just to touch each other and peek into each other\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026 thanks for this year. Nice to see you again next year, Uffi.\u201d\u201cYes, Anis. May you feel happy again next year.\u201dAgain, the mouthfeel I touched was accompanied by sweet paralysis, which made me feel certain happiness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: 79When Her Majesty the Queen of Uphilia\u2019s rule began and the people also regained calm from the joy of their reign.New moves were spread by Her Majesty the new Queen, and the Kingdom of Palletia was full of vigour.Everyone dreamed of a day when new technology, magic, would spread and had hope for a vision for the future.That\u2019s why they don\u2019t remember anymore.About him, who was Uphilia\u2019s fianc\u00e9. About the prince who was supposed to be king.Everyone had already forgotten. In the joy of the beginning of a new era, as if I hadn\u2019t been there since the beginning.Sole was lurking his breath.Slowly and carefully pack the distance. At the end of Sole\u2019s sight is an old western hall.The garden, which can\u2019t even be flattered, is creepy enough to say whether this is still the case.Still, the sole\u2019s leg never stops, and he goes without a sound so that it turns to the back.If you put your hand on the back door, make a slight noise.Thore stroked his chest down, driven by the urge to punch his tongue, but without making any other noise around him.He slips himself inside and moves on.It was still dim inside, creating an atmosphere that did not damage the creepy appearance.Step by step, step by step, go along like saying you shouldn\u2019t even zero the sound of breath.Eventually, Sole finally found it. It was best not to lose my sanity, not to speak out.Sole tries to reach for what takes his own eyes, while being caught fluttering -.\u201cYou\u2019re a rare guest.\u201d\u201c- Huh!?\u201dBehind him, sooner than he looked back, Sole\u2019s body was attacked by the feeling of heaven and earth reversing.And the first time I caught it in my upside down vision, it was one young man.The creepy western hall has bright platinum hair that is not commensurate with each other, and the shape of the face is neat and it is not an exaggeration to call it exactly your son.But those eyes are ominously red in color. It disturbs the impression that the imbalance cannot help but be received from the youth.That was the meeting with him, Algardo Bona Palettia.Algardo Bona Palettia.He is a prince of the Kingdom of Palletia, formerly of the throne. But it is also a thing of the past.Algardo, stripped of his right to inherit the throne and abandoned, lived by being flown to the border known as the end of the Kingdom of Palettia.A minimal number of people, who once lived to restore a western hall that existed as your home, never bothered with the landscape of the hall.Everyone, such as the prince, who lived in the creepy hall, thought it creepy and treated it as something that was not there, with no neighbors or prying about anything.Therefore, no one approaches his Western hall. Unless that\u2019s also the odd one.Such a strange and uninvited guest was visiting his abode, the Western Hall.\u201cUgh\u2026! Get off me!It was only a matter of time before such a rare customer appeared before Algard.There are those who are tied up before Algard but can roar with majesty. Algardo shows his breath nibbling at his shoulders.\u201cYou\u2019ve had a very powerful burglar.\u201dYes. Tied up in front of Algardo are the undelivered who were trying to fish for food in the western hall where Algardo lives.It looks like it\u2019s a narrow outfit to see, and I have trouble eating it. But there was something else that attracted Algard\u2019s interest.The undelivered were girls. The girl, supposedly of lower age than Algard, had an area on its head not equipped by humans.The girl\u2019s hair is silver enough to reach her waist, and her ears are shaking to match the girl\u2019s emotions when it comes to the same \u201chairy\u201d wolf as that silver hair.\u201cIs it real?\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!With all the momentum that still bites, the girl shakes her head and pays Algardo\u2019s hand that touches her own head. I know very well that the stripped dog teeth are pointy as fangs.I guess this is a real ear because of the texture I\u2019ve tried touching my ears and even the fact that it\u2019s moving, Algardo decides. Furthermore, it was decisive because behind the girl the same furry tail was shaking to intimidate her.\u201cWarwolf\u2026? But you\u2019re human enough for that.\u201dSome demons are close to looking like humans. Among them are demons of werewolf descent who work bipedally like people.One of them is Warwolf. But Algard knows that Warwolf is a \u201cbipedal wolf\u201d and not a \u201cwolf\u2019s ear and tail on a person\u201d.\u201cUgh!While Algard lays his hand on his jaw but observes, the wolf-eared girl is roaring mightily.Those eyes are blue eyes with a shitty, vibrant light. For a while, it was Algard, who was gazing at the girl, but breathed out slowly.\u201cWhy did you try to work the theft?\u2026\u2026\u201cWhere are you from?\u2026\u2026There is no answer from the girl. Let Algard stroke his jaw wondering what\u2019s going on.Algard, who was lagging behind in his ideas, heard at that time a different sound from the roar from the girl\u2019s.It was a loud belly bug sounding.\u201c\u2026 ha\u201dAlgard exhales and turns his back on the girl and tries to leave the room.The girl leaned powerlessly against Algard trying to leave the room behind, but immediately raised her face and yelled.\u201cSeriously! Untie this! Hey!\u201dCan\u2019t you even hear the girl cursing, Algard\u2019s not closing the door anymore?The girl, who was holding her hands and feet in captivity so as not to be rumbled, turns around and manages to escape the detention.But there is no sign that the restraint can be relegated ruthlessly. Eventually, the part of the restraint is gradually rubbed off because of the violent attempt to release the restraint.Still, the girl can power the rope she\u2019s holding in captivity. But once again, the belly bug buzzes makes me weak all at once.\u201c\u2026 hungry\u2026 hungry\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 then don\u2019t go wild in vain\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Algard who answered the girl\u2019s whine. At some point he was coming back.There\u2019s a tray in that hand, and there\u2019s a good smell of a girl sniffing her nose. The girl slurred her throat at at the smell of stimulating appetite.\u201c\u2026 I won\u2019t give this to you if you\u2019re going to break out. All right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ya, can I eat\u2026?The girl asks because she can\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t understand why you try to feed yourself for trying to steal.Leaving behind a girl who could not understand, Algard placed a tray on the table and took a vessel that smelled good in its hands. On the other hand, a spoon is taken and the contents are snapped.There seemed to be soup in the vessel. With a hint of hot air, there is no nostrils, and there is zero salivation from the edge of the girl\u2019s mouth.\u201cDo you smell weird, or what?\u201cNo\u2026\u2026 but\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dIn reply to the girl, Algardo carried a spoon of soup\u2026 into his own mouth.Oh, and a sad voice leaks out of the girl\u2019s mouth. Even though I was hungry, I could eat something that looked delicious in front of me. Anger at the place makes me think I\u2019m going to be bright red in front of you.\u201c\u2026 as you can see, it\u2019s not poisoned\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?But the girl, who was about to turn bright red with anger, was quelled by the words that went on.Algardo spoons the soup again and carries it to the girl\u2019s mouth. The girl includes a spoon in her mouth to bite her like she can\u2019t stand it.\u201c~ ~ ~ ~ ~!\u201dHow long has it been? I couldn\u2019t even remember her aggressively, but the girl was captivated by the taste that irritated her tongue.Delicious, delicious. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever know. But a sip of the spoon is not enough at all.\u201cRelax, this is for you. Eat slowly.\u201d\u201cQuickly! Quickly!\u201cCalm down\u2026 oh, that\u2019s good enough. Drink as much as you like.\u201dAlgardo carries the girl many spoons and makes her drink soup like she reluctantly said.Even though the soup alone was delicious, whenever finely chopped meat and vegetable scraps rode the tongue, the girl chewed the soup as she nearly cried.There was also less soup in the vessel, and Algard took the vessel.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cCan I eat all this at once? Don\u2019t be a jerk. Tilt the vessel a little bit.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dThe girl put her mouth on the vessel like she completely forgot to be alert to Algard.Drink up the soup that is carried to your mouth from a slowly tilted vessel indifferently.Eventually he drank all the soup in the vessel and the girl exhaled satisfactorily. There are tears coming out of his eyes.\u201cHuh\u2026 Huh\u2026!It was delicious. Just filled and that satisfaction makes the girl weep.Algard just kept staring quietly at the girl crying.\u201c\u2026 acrylic\u201d\u201cAcrylic, huh? Is that your name?\u201cYes.\u201dThe wolf-eared girl, Acrylic named herself Algard with a flashing look on her face.I\u2019m not completely alert. However, you understood that Algardo would not do unreasonable tricks, even though he was alert, he was beginning to answer Algardo\u2019s questions.\u201cAcrylic, you\u2026 you\u2019ve crossed the border, no, the mountain?\u201c\u2026 why, do you think?\u201cBecause your words are not the public language of the Kingdom of Palettia\u201d\u201cThe Kingdom of Palettia?Acrylic skewed his eyebrows in surprise. From that reaction, Algardo decided that apparently Acrylic did not know the Kingdom of Palletia.The words that acrylics have spoken since the beginning are not those used in the Kingdom of Palletia. Without his upbringing as a prince, the conversation would not have been formed.From the words of the acrylic, Algardo decided that the acrylic came from a neighbouring country in the Kingdom of Palletia.The Kingdom of Palletia has a natural land. The kingdom of Palletia is filled with resourceful nature, such as deep forests, where the hands of men cannot be fully placed on land far enough to cultivate the fields, and mountain ranges that stand to divide the country.And the land on the border where Algard is located is at the edge of the mountain range that draws the border.The mountains and forests, and the land that is supposedly connected to the sea if we go further, are also home to many monsters, and even in order to build people, it was a territorial usurpation with monsters, and they continued to retreat.Although the western hall inhabited by Algard was once a man-built territory, it was once abandoned from the outbreak of stampede and so on, and once again the realm was restored to this point.That\u2019s why Algardo lives in this western hall with the minimum number of people needed. It\u2019s also valuable to be able to hire people here.\u201cDidn\u2019t you come from the neighboring kingdom of Cambus?Across the Kingdom of Palletia and the mountain ranges, the Kingdom of Cambus is located on the other side.Although there are no exchanges due to rugged mountain ranges and nature inhibition in this peripheral land, there are transactions between countries.However, since mountain ranges are still used as borders, it is not possible to say that it is difficult to cross each other\u2019s territory and that there is a deep connection.Therefore, the impression is that we are neighbors who are less involved if we do not know each other and if we are not merchants or diplomats.By contrast, the border line and neighboring countries off the mountain range used to be targeted by Tiger Sight until Orphans, the former king, took office\u2026 but the Kingdom of Cambus was not included.(Indeed, it was a country similar to the Kingdom of Palletia but less developed in magic as a condition of national territory\u2026)It is said that the cut off of the Kingdom of Palletia was the feat of the first king who made the Spirit covenant, from which he began to build his country with the aristocrats who could use magic.Therefore, although the emphasis is on magic, the Kingdom of Cambus is made up differently, and magic technology has not developed that far.Apparently, I can\u2019t say for sure because I don\u2019t have much information on the Kingdom of Cambus. I hear that the national traffic itself is thin, and that it is an exclusive state that does not want to enter its own country anyway to interact with the leftovers there.It\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to argue, it\u2019s good if we have the minimum necessary relationship. It\u2019s a country that has logistical problems and doesn\u2019t really go into it as a country.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201dBut what Algard expected. Acrylic shook his neck from left to right on the back.\u201cDon\u2019t you know,\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anything. Nothing\u2026\u201dAcrylic shook his neck left and right without force, then closed his mouth.Acrylic\u2019s face, which he has silenced, has a depressing, unhegemonic look on his face.For the time being, it was Algard watching the acrylic that was silent, but he exhales slowly.\u201cIf you\u2019re not going, are you here?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m interested in you\u201d\u201c\u2026 to me?\u201cI want to know about you. That\u2019s the consideration. I\u2019ll live here and find out about you. Instead, you can live here. I\u2019ll serve you a meal, and I\u2019ll get you a bed.\u201dAcrylic looked at Algard\u2019s face with the expression, I don\u2019t know what he was talking about.\u201cWell, you have no right to choose. You\u2019re a thief. You can\u2019t complain about being killed on the spot if it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to kill me without darkness. You deserve it. And I want you to help me find out about you. \u2026 If you do not snort, you may take the necessary steps to comply\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh!? Him, doing terrible things!?\u201d\u201cI want you to follow me if you don\u2019t want to be. I\u2019ll serve you a meal, and I swear I won\u2019t do anything stupid. Unless you do something wrong here, I\u2019ll even think about detaining you.\u201dAcrylic stares at Algard with his eyes round. Then I narrowed my eyes as I roared and thought.How much time had passed since Acrylic roared, Acrylic had stopped roaring and was completely grown up.\u201c\u2026 I won\u2019t break out. But if I do something terrible, I resist.\u201d\u201cOkay. I swear, we have to imitate it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you, what\u2019s your name?\u201c\u2026 oh, you didn\u2019t name it\u201dThat\u2019s right. Algard distorted his mouth just a little and made him laugh bitterly.\u201cAl\u2026. it\u2019s just Al. Call me Al.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: 80\u201cI made the acrylic room ready. I don\u2019t mind if you use this room freely.\u201dAlgardo guided the acrylic in one of the rooms used by the servants of the Western Hall.Furniture is minimal, but there is a complete set of beds, tables, closets, etc. that you think you need. Although, I don\u2019t have any clothes in my closet.Still, the acrylic is making my eyes peel with restlessness. Responding to the acrylic mood, my tail and wolf ears are also shaking loosely.\u201cMake sure you\u2019re in this room until I get here. Use the bell next to the bed if you need it. There are others but me, but when you get out of this room, don\u2019t think you can guarantee your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you mean to be killed?\u201cThey also have a position. I made up my mind to protect you. [M] If you don\u2019t listen to me, I won\u2019t guarantee it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 who is Al?\u201cIt\u2019s just Al\u201dAcrylic looked surprised not to be satisfied with Algard\u2019s response, but decided to convince him that it was his fault that he had originally broken into the hall for stealing.But that seemed strange to acrylics. How can Al protect himself? And. Acrylic also knows that if you leave the room, you may be killed, which means that your existence is not well thought out.Acrylic stared jiggly at Algard\u2019s face out of doubt, but when he noticed his gaze, Algard smiled and showed it.\u201cYou may be anxious, but I won\u2019t let you live badly. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m interested in acrylics.\u201d\u201cInterested, what?\u201cThat Acrylic may be a resident of the Kingdom of Cambus. And should I say to the kingdom of Palettia, a beast like you? Such races do not exist. Because I wanted to know about the ecology and life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dI\u2019m interested in myself, acrylic distorted my brow uncomfortably by the word.The reaction is proof that the acrylic was clearly uncomfortable. Freeze your attitude. Acrylic whines small.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s who you are, too\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by honoring me\u2026 but at least I hear your treatment hasn\u2019t been good before.\u201dAlgardo squeaks without looking particularly concerned about the reaction of the acrylic.\u201cIt would be nice if you could judge me by my upcoming behavior if I were the same person you say I am. If you don\u2019t like it, you can run away. I don\u2019t lock it. But I can\u2019t guarantee your life from there. I hope that\u2019s all you know now.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026No more acrylic returns anything to Algard\u2019s words. I\u2019m just silent, staring at Algard.Algard says nothing and keeps his back on the acrylic and heads to the door.\u201cWell, get some rest. Let the meal deliver three meals in the morning, day and night. The clothes\u2026 wait a minute. And you had a habit of taking a bath?\u201cBath\u2026\u2026?\u2026 usually in the water.\u201d\u201cRight. I\u2019d be in trouble if you weren\u2019t so tidy here. It will come with surveillance, but we\u2019ll be ready later. Yeah, surveillance doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going in there. You should take your time alone.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 what\u2019s up?\u201cKick, clean up\u2026 don\u2019t think you can free my body\u2026!Kiku, and acrylics that show resistance posture as you hug your own body. Algardo turned his eyes round to such acrylic words.Then Algard bent his back and began to indulge in what seemed like a big laugh. Acrylics blink at reactions I never thought I would.\u201cOh well. Did you ever worry about that? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get around to it.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cI\u2019m not going to treat you like a slave. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m willing to invite you as a guest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 customers?\u201cOh. I want you to hang out with me for about a little experiment, but I\u2019m not going to make you feel painful, and I\u2019m not going to treat you like a livestock or animal. You are my guest. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me for not waving the big hand.\u201dAcrylic stared at Algard with his eyes round and his mouth poking open.Deepening his grin at the distracted acrylic, Algardo tried to leave the room intact.\u201cAnd I\u2019m not interested in kids\u201d\u201cBecome -!?\u201dAcrylic faces stain bright red all at once on words like those containing laughter.The sound of the door being closed sounds and the acrylic is left alone in the room. Puffy trembling, the acrylic reversing her tail and ear hair sucked in her breath loudly and screamed.\u201cBhahhhh!!\u201d\u201cDear Algard,\u201dIt was the man in the old butler\u2019s clothes who appeared without sound behind Algard, the Algard who followed the acrylic room.It looks quite old, but the back is not bent and it also seems as if it contains one core.The hair, completely dyed white, is wrapped up in an all-back, an old man who embodies exactly what a butler can do.\u201cClive.\u201d\u201cWe apologize for not noticing the discovery of this trespasser\u201dDeeply bowing old man, Algard\u2019s gaze toward Clive is calm.Clive is a minister who takes the lead in taking care of Algard around him. But Algard doesn\u2019t think he needs to be that much either. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t give a shit about this one.\u201cNo, we\u2019re turning the hall around with the smallest number of people. And maintaining the museum is not your business. I\u2019m in a position to hire a servant to take care of you.\u201d\u201cPlay.\u201d\u201cSeriously.\u201dAlgard is an abandoned prince. I have lost my right to inherit the throne, and as a royalty, I am done.It\u2019s okay to treat him the same way as a civilian, but Algardo feels that not to do so is due to the warmth of the Clives his father put on Algardo.So Algard is trying to take care of himself as much as he can, but if Clive wants to, he won\u2019t even be forced to stop. Clive just happened to be out of his seat during the acrylic intrusion. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201cIf anything should happen to Master Algard, I am sorry to His Majesty the Father\u201d\u201c\u2026 now we\u2019re talking. Stop talking about speculation that isn\u2019t even there, Clive. You don\u2019t want to be called Master Clive, do you? Take your respect off me, too.\u201dClive was originally a deacon on Algard\u2019s father, Lord Orphans.He retreated from the line from that age and rushed to the place where he had enjoyed the rest of his life when he heard the news of Algard\u2019s abandonment.And when Algard went to the border, he came with me as the person in charge. I think he gets that far because there was a time when Algardo was also adored by Clive when he was a kid.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Before Clive retreated from the line, he was a heartfelt old man who gently taught Algard his mindset as a prince and his father\u2019s feat. Therefore, as an Algard, I can\u2019t get out strongly\u2026\u201cThat Lord Algard does not believe in His Majesty\u2019s warmth?\u201c\u2026 I feel warmth, but I\u2019m telling you not to bring up family feelings or anything. I\u2019m not allowed to do this anymore. Don\u2019t abuse me too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026 awed\u201dAlgard feels that what was between us was that Clive was dissatisfied with the status quo.That\u2019s not so much about the environment as about Algardo himself. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t have anything to think about it, but to swallow honestly, Algardo is aware of what he is making me persevere.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you to touch me. It\u2019s good to take care of yourself on your own. I don\u2019t complain about that. But don\u2019t just try to preach your family\u2019s untrained or emotional feelings.\u201cSo, this is that girl who worked the theft\u2026 with the intention of being seriously protected?\u201cAh. I\u2019ll see what I can find out here if there\u2019s any danger\u2026 why don\u2019t you put a bulletin in my sister\u201d\u201cTo His Royal Highness King Anisphere?\u201cThat sister would be brave and happy to prepare you for better treatment than here.\u201dAcrylics are not normal people. Algard stares at the possibility of holding a \u201cdemon stone\u201d.Demonic stones supposedly created by demons eating spirits and degenerating spiritual stones created in the body.It is an organ that is originally present in demons, but I am guessing that acrylics are more of a kind than they are also present in human-shaped demons.I do not believe that acrylics with such a background can normally live in the Kingdom of Palletia. The Cambus kingdom, which seems to be her hometown, is also riddled with mystery, so I can\u2019t even say that I should return to the country.Algard thought the future of acrylics would be brighter if he spoke to that unusual, odd sister.\u201cClive, I\u2019m sorry, can you get me a change of clothes for the acrylic?\u201cWe are men\u2019s belts. If it\u2019s women\u2019s clothing, let\u2019s negotiate when sourcing in the village.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think I know more\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone near that girl.\u201d\u201cAh. Don\u2019t get your hands on it if you find it. If you\u2019re leaving here, you don\u2019t have to chase me. Missed him. That\u2019s where I left my hand. I can\u2019t be held responsible for wild drowning. We can\u2019t let the dead die here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you say?To Algard\u2019s words, Clive hammers as he asks his intentions.Algard nodded one and then said:\u201cThat looks like a kid, but\u2026 \u2013 he\u2019s strong. You must be trained for something.\u201d(\u2026 weird guy)Acrylic was having a sleepless night. After that, I took a bath with Algard\u2019s guidance and was returned to my room, surprised by its comfort.When the night came and put me in a beautiful bed, on the contrary, I felt more comfortable than restless. It was a man named Al who made me think of acrylics that kept doing such incredible things.Even though Acrylic knew about the existence of a bath, he thought it was something that had nothing to do with him, and bathing in the water wasn\u2019t something he could do every day.It\u2019s not like they let me use the bed or anything superior when I go to bed, and they gave me a blanket and I trembled in the cold.\u201c\u2026 warm. Smell of the day\u2026\u2026\u201dI reposition myself in the thighs and futon and inhale the smell of the sheets all over me.Comfortable as a lie, comfortable. That\u2019s why doubts about Algard just swell up.I thought that I was really interested in myself because I treated myself like a whore as a strange slave, but I was also told that I was not interested.\u201c\u2026 then why\u201dAcrylic doesn\u2019t know. Because I don\u2019t know this warmth applied to Algardo. So I don\u2019t know why Algard makes me so good to myself.So I thought it was creepy, but I couldn\u2019t help but come closer to Algard, which also led to a relaxation of my guard. Because it still makes sense.\u201c\u2026 Al\u2026\u201dAm I allowed to stay here?No one can hear the inquiry. Drowsingly inviting acrylic eyes slowly fall.I don\u2019t notice acrylics falling asleep. That a tear fell from his eyes.On that day, Acrylic was able to sleep for the first time in a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Look, you know what I mean.\u201dA few days had passed since Acrylic entered the Western Hall where Algard lived to steal.Since then, Algardo has been present at the Acrylic dining table. Algardo brought in an acrylic meal, tasted poisonous, and then served the acrylic portion, but how long had we been surrounding the meal together?At first, soup was the main meal, but after I found out that acrylic was fine, I started serving regular meals. It was so delicious that I had never eaten any of the meals, it was an acrylic that I was disappointed in, but I\u2019ve been eating it a lot lately.It was only a meal to fill the hunger at first, but the margin of being able to take a meal without even being hungry was starting to make acrylics care about people\u2019s gaze.Algardo was eating beautifully in front of the disappointing acrylic, because it was one of the causes. Algard\u2019s meal must have been beautiful and he fell in love with it by accident. Then acrylics also stop disappointing and try to eat with Algardo\u2019s appearance.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is this satisfying Al\u2019s interest?Algard said he wanted to know about acrylics as a condition of being here, but he hasn\u2019t taken any action to make it clear to acrylics yet.It was a word that came out of that question, but Algardo stops his dietary hand and wipes his mouth with a cloth towel.\u201cRight. Looks like the acrylic and a lot of nervousness have been removed. First\u2026\u2026\u201dFeeding it, or the acrylic frown stops by. I realized I had been caught eating since I was told.Still, I don\u2019t go back to what I ate. If you don\u2019t fight back, you\u2019ll never get hungry. With that in mind, Acrylic was surprised no matter what he said, and now it\u2019s time for me to get up.\u201cLet\u2019s study.\u201d\u201c\u2026 study?\u201cAh. It\u2019s from the public language of the Kingdom of Palettia.\u201dAcrylic tilted his neck without knowing what it meant. I wonder why I\u2019m talking about studying.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, that\u2019s your face.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cIn the first place. We don\u2019t know each other in detail. The language makes sense, but it is also natural that cultures differ if countries are different. In order to do this, we need to get to know each other. As a prerequisite, I\u2019m just asking you to learn these words to make it easier to communicate.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me the words\u2026?I wonder why you do that.That\u2019s the kind of question that comes to mind in acrylic breasts. Algard seems to be even more serious about it, which in turn deepens acrylic perplexity.\u201cAt the end of the day, I will gain. I don\u2019t want to study even if they kill me, if you say so, I won\u2019t force you\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to!\u201cRight. Then let\u2019s take a post-meal break and start class for the day. You\u2019ll be bored even when you\u2019re in the room. I\u2019ve got homework for you, too, so you\u2019ll be free. You can even read a book if you remember the words. I don\u2019t think acrylics can hurt you, either.\u201cA book\u2026 do you have such a fancy product\u2026?\u201cHmm? Well, it\u2019s true that a book is somewhat expensive, but it\u2019s not an amount that even civilians can\u2019t reach. That\u2019s the general story in this country\u2026. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u2026\u2026Finally, Algard leaned down and whispered to mock himself. Acrylic ears even pick up such an Algard grunt.That bothered me, but when I realized that Algard had a face I had never seen before, the acrylic shut its mouth.\u201cAcrylic,\u201d it says in the letter of this country.\u201cNow\u2026 my name?\u201cThat\u2019s right. You could write more beautifully if you practice.\u201dRun the pen and let Algardo show you an example and write it down on the acrylic.Words make sense, so Algardo makes them teach and write down meaning while translating from simple words to acrylics. Repeat the task of having the pronunciation written down as well.Acrylic is running his pen like he said it was fun to be able to study. I haven\u2019t been able to hide that ear and tail moving in a good mood, and Algard loosens his mouth naturally.\u201cAre you having fun?\u201cYeah!\u201dAcrylic answers Algard\u2019s query with momentum. Then, the acrylic looks up at Algardo like he\u2019s pissed off. Feeling the smile of Algard\u2019s gaze, Acrylic turns his face red and turns away.Algardo leaks a laugh at how such acrylics look.\u201cWow, don\u2019t laugh!\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026. hey acrylic\u201d\u201cAlready\u2026 what?\u201cDo you mind if we talk a little bit about the future?\u201c\u2026 future stories?Algard stopped laughing and tightened his expression. Acrylic, who saw that change in Algard\u2019s expression, also tightened his expression.The gentle air until earlier disappears, and the breathtaking feeling of tension that seems to draw my throat becomes full.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about what acrylics are going to do.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cI invited you as a guest, even though it was in front of the building. I want to know what you want to do.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened when you came in here to steal. I see there\u2019s something stuck in the wings.\u201dTo Algard\u2019s words, Acrylic chooses silence by pulling his lips together.Nor does it look like he cared about the silence of the acrylic, Algardo continues.\u201cFortunately, this is the border. It would be nice if you looked forward to a peaceful life. If you have somewhere you want to go, I\u2019ll help you go for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 how can you get that far?\u201cRight\u2026\u2026 Tell us why, but we don\u2019t know each other\u2019s circumstances. The environment in which I grew up is different. I don\u2019t think it makes sense where we talked about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t you going to talk because you don\u2019t know?\u201cEven though we don\u2019t know if we can understand each other?Algardo\u2019s eyes are narrowed for acrylic inquiries. If I could look into those crimson eyes, I would suffer so much that my acrylic breath would become clogged.\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy, such as telling everything and you can understand it. No matter how many words you exhaust, no matter how many thoughts you speak, you can\u2019t overlap them all. You only need to know that I have a reason to do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 there is no guarantee that you will not betray me at the end\u201d\u201cNo one can betray others. It\u2019s people who betray themselves. \u2026 but\u201dAlgard\u2019s hand reaches for the acrylic. Acrylic hardens itself due to the agitation of the reaction. Because Algard\u2019s outstretched hand had no killing spirit, no hostility.Pong, and Algard\u2019s hand can be put on the acrylic head. With his head caressed with gentle hands as it is, acrylic blinks.\u201cI don\u2019t want to betray you,\u201d he said. I can act with that in mind. \u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know, I think acrylic. I can\u2019t tell what a man named Al looks like in acrylics. Perhaps I can understand it if I know what the circumstances are that he doesn\u2019t talk about.I have no reason to believe it. I can tell you I won\u2019t betray you with my mouth, I won\u2019t fool you. If you just say it, anyone can do it if you just look good.(Still\u2026 if Al, can I be fooled)I don\u2019t want to think this gentle hand is a lie. Acrylics couldn\u2019t let go of this warm time.\u201cAl. I want you to listen to me. About me, to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, let me hear it for sure\u201dAlgardo nods loudly at the words that Acrylic tells him by squeezing his expression.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Seeing Algard nodded, Acrylic breathed heavily, getting his breath ready before slowly starting to talk.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m from what Al calls the Cambus Kingdom. \u2018Cause I never got out of there.\u201d\u201cLee?\u201d\u201cWe called ourselves Licant. It\u2019s been told that werewolves, people and demon wolves, were born together. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true\u2026\u201dAcrylic\u2019s mouth remains heavy, he says, because he was not interested. Algard was listening arm in arm to arm to acrylic circumstances spoken in a voice smaller than the pompous and normal volume of voice.\u201cWe, Ricant, lived in the woods. I hunted beasts and demons, gathered the grace of the woods, and lived there.\u201d\u201cSo wasn\u2019t Ricant interacting with the outside world?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be a good thing to be involved with people outside. If anyone gets lost, I\u2019ll chase them back, or I won\u2019t do anything if I see them in the woods. I didn\u2019t want to have to get involved until I got out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but now you\u2019re out\u201d\u201cI was caught, by a human.\u201dAcrylic whines as he turns to hold his own body tight. Algardo frowned at the word \u201cgrab\u201d.\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what Al calls a canvas kingdom. But there were a lot of people. There were all sorts of other races gathered there.\u201d\u201cVarious races? That means it\u2019s just like Licant\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, the humans call us subhuman\u2026. where they forced me to kill.\u201d\u201cMurderer\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t every time. But he asked me to help him fight again and again. If I refused, they would whip me, skip my meal\u2026 I thought I\u2019d die many times, and I even thought you\u2019d kill me.\u201dBehind Acrylic\u2019s brain comes a clear resurgence of the past he experienced.The fact that he was caught in return for trying to chase back a man who approached him inside. From then on, every day they put me in a rough hut and force me to fight.Some of them wanted to kill people. If I don\u2019t kill him, I\u2019ll be whipped myself. On the contrary, he was about to be killed by a relative human.\u201cI no longer have the strength to defy, and no one around me ever opens my mouth\u2026 it was hell\u201d\u201c\u2026 so you could get away with it?\u201cWhen we escaped, we were being transported somewhere. I was put in a cage, but less people than usual. I took the lead, but the other kids broke into the woods because of me.\u201d\u201cSo, you said you got here?\u201c\u2026 yes. I\u2019ve been wandering for days without knowing.\u201dAcrylic exhaled deeply to say so, saying that he had said it all out.Algard is silent for now to put his hand on his chin and think in.\u201c\u2026 can you think of any worries about the chaser?\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dTo breathing Algardo, Acrylic was breathtaking. I was here, fed, in a place to calm down and relaxed. But the possibility that I might be pursued had not yet disappeared.Maybe, and the imagination comes to mind behind the acrylic brain. Maybe Al will try to kick himself out, he said.\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t worry\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t throw it out. This is also on the edge of something. I told you that.Soothe his expression. Algardo continues with a grin, either to reassure him.\u201cHe wants to know about acrylics. About a species called Licant, about an acrylic individual. I mean, for me, you deserve to be invited as a guest. So\u2026 oh, yeah\u201dStroking Acrylic\u2019s cheek, Algardo continues with his brow butt dropped like trouble.\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh\u2026!To the words, acrylics shook my mind with much more intense shocks than I thought.He was grabbed from the inside, forced to do unwanted things, wandered ahead of him and fled with his life, and arrived here.Here is Al, who throws a bunk and gentle words that will not be threatened by a warm meal. Acrylic thought that was definitely a happy thing.Acrylic thought he was saved. That unconsciously unties the shackles of fear that were tying the acrylic.\u201c\u2026 me, can I stay here?\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. Let\u2019s hope I want you here.\u201dThat was the word I wanted above all for Acrylic.He said it\u2019s okay to stay here. Someone will be here to admit it.Earliest, speechless. It just gets hot in the back of my eyes and makes me cry one after the other.Algardo, who had his hand on his cheek, turns his hand around the back of the acrylic. Acrylic deposited his forehead with Algard so that he could lean over to the plump of his hand, which was accompanied by a one-handed hug.Algardo just keeps stroking his back, crying acrylic without words. Until the acrylic is tired of crying and sleeping, all the time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82: 82Algard put the crying tired and falling asleep acrylic to bed and closed the door so as not to make a sound softly.The exhaled exhalation is heavy and I can feel it coming down to my shoulder. It was when I tried to get away from the acrylic room as it was.\u201cOh, hey, aren\u2019t you going to give me a hand? Prince.\u201dAlgardo stopped to the man, who appeared soundless from the other side of the hallway.A man characterized by burning red hair. Was it around the middle of thirty when I was a year old? I can see that body is big and well worked out. Obviously a warrior\u2019s body.His red-brown eyes like that arc fun and reflect Algard. Algardo narrowed his eyes to a red-haired man who would obviously look at himself with teasing glances.\u201cDarren.\u201d\u201cOh, scary scary scary. Isn\u2019t that nice? I\u2019ve never had a chance to taste a woman in this neighborhood.\u201dThe man, called Darren, laughed at his heels and flaunted his shoulders. Algard sighs and shows.\u201c\u2026 hateful, I can\u2019t be in love with a man like you\u201d\u201cIs it ironic? Well, it\u2019s true that the play was too much to be allotted! Ha ha!\u201cNot that I could say, but it sucks.\u201dAlgard makes Darren look evil like he\u2019s tired.Darren Cochinille was the warrant of the Viscount Cochinille family. Darren left the house and acted as an adventurer because he had a brother and the governor inherited him. It was only natural that he chose adventurers as his business to take advantage of his magical talents.That\u2019s how he flushed his floating name. Naturally, I also bought anger from my parents and was duped. He\u2019s here like that because he was chosen as Algard\u2019s escort.A man of arms, even if he has some problems with his personality. And\u2026 those who supposedly had no problem breathing out in the land of the border. Darren was one of them. Darren was impeccable as a man who could travel to the border land without a squire.\u201cMy nearby village daughter is dictating. No, the man in the village has a harsh gaze.\u201d\u201cKeep it on track. They won\u2019t stand up against us, either, but they won\u2019t be happy when it\u2019s over.\u201dOn the face of it, Algard was deported to the border because he was rendered obsolete. The original purpose of the expulsion was to keep Algardo away from the throne and to carry out the study without anyone knowing that Algardo had become a vampire.But naturally, I can\u2019t be out-of-the-box. Therefore, Algardo and the others have made it their job to help develop the border. This is a land where demonic power zones were developed, and once stampeded and the power zones rejuvenated is new to memory.Still, people challenge demons for resources that make them wealth. This is the front-line land.\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not an adventurer or a fan, you\u2019re not going to lean in. If nobles and adventurers behave tyrannically, they\u2019ll hate you all together.\u201d\u201cThey are our lifeline. Never treat me coarsely, huh?\u201cI know. I know very well that food and moisture are needed to fight the battle.\u201dThat said Darren laughed belligerently. The only reason he was chosen to make his way to this peripheral land is not the poor bare line. Because, to put it briefly, he has a side of combat fanaticism.There are also many demonic raids here. Not only that, but it is also inevitable to encounter demons for pioneering and collecting resources. The demonic thinning that takes place on a daily basis is present on the hobby extension line for Darren.That is also the reason why people are said to be understaffed at Algard\u2019s mansion, but it is basically the rule of this mansion to do your thing on your own because you have no additional funds or intention of hiring people.\u201c\u2026 so you won\u2019t get your hands on it?\u201c\u2026 do you really want to take it to that story\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m worried. If you\u2019re in this creepy hall all day, and the researchers are still young, you can play around in the corner.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t deserve that, and I don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s it.\u201dAlgard walked out with his back turned to refuse. Looking away at her back, Darren sighed softly as she scratched her head.\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass to make my brother stubborn, Master Anis\u2026\u201d(\u2026 Who is Al?I dawned again after Acrylic spoke over me. By this time the acrylic was also lighter in the public language of the Kingdom of Palletia so that we could have a conversation. The acrylic I could afford thought about Algard.Since then Al has been stuffing me through to the acrylic room. Algardo gently laughed and stroked his head when he could speak in the words of the Kingdom of Palettia one by one. Even though the warmth was delightful, Acrylic had spared some subtle emotions that would embarrass him somewhere.It was the question of what the hell Al was like to think about thinking sideways to divert attention from such extraneous emotions.(The work is so beautiful, because I live in your mansion\u2026 someone with an identity, is it?To the extent that the study of letters is present, if you proceed, the study of common sense has also been mixed a little bit. I guess that also became a factor in acrylics spreading their thinking.It is the king who is up there like the head of the inside, the noble who serves the king, the civilian who has no identity. Though pompous, Acrylic recognized the kingdom as such.Algard has no sign of being a civilian. If so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s noble. But Algard never told Acrylic who he was.(\u2026 would you answer me if I asked?Though that thought passed and I saw it, there is no sign that the door will be knocked. It bothers me and I turn my gaze at the door.(Is something wrong\u2026?Now for the record, Acrylic doesn\u2019t know anything about this place. Who is Algardo and what other people live in this mansion?If the imagination of being someone with an identity is true, why does Algardo live in this mansion?I can\u2019t get the question out of my head once I\u2019m concerned. Not even willing to study, distracted and Acrylic left his body in bed.\u201c\u2026 Al\u201dHe told me I could stay here, but I don\u2019t know what I want to do now.In the Kingdom of Palettia, perhaps no one has the ears or tails of a beast like himself.Then this is the only place you really have to go. Think that far. Acrylic hides his sight with his hands around his eyes.\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s nothing I can do about it\u201dI don\u2019t want to get out of here. But it\u2019s painful, scary, painful to wait until Al gets here. I want to open this door right now and go see Al.Wait, wait, there\u2019s no sign of the door being knocked. Acrylic bites his teeth as he hugs his own body.\u201c\u2026 when I leave here, I won\u2019t guarantee my life\u201dThat\u2019s what I promised Al. But still.Acrylic woke up and gently laid his hands on the door. My heart is pounding so hard that I don\u2019t like it when I blurt.I honestly don\u2019t know what will happen when I leave here. Even if I can see Al, Al could get angry. It\u2019s not Al. If you meet someone, they could kill you.I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right about making a big deal out of it here. Smart choice. A calm self whispers in my head that it\u2019s better to do that.\u201cBut I\u2019m also jittery\u2026 I\u2019m scared\u201dReinforced in his trembling hand, never willing, Acrylic slowly opened the door.Look down the hall like a peek in. No sign of people, no noise. After confirming it, the acrylic exhales quietly and erases its own signs.Life inside was dominated by hunting. Therefore, the art of turning off signs has been learned since childhood. Acrylic carefully goes down the hallway to avoid making any noise while keeping his mind calm.There are surprisingly few signs of people in the mansion. Is it minimal to take care of, or is it full of creepy air that must be the exterior of the mansion I saw outside?Acrylic goes down the hallway to avoid making any noise while scolding the feelings that make him feel frightened. Hiding in the shadows of the hallway, he goes one step, one step, exploring the signs ahead.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u2026\u2026Then I heard people. At the same time, I felt the smell of acrylic sniffing.The smell was a familiar smell, and when the smell recognized something, tension ran on the acrylic.\u201cOf blood, smell\u2026?Why? And while Acrylic wondered, he peered and looked into the shadows of the hallway to those who smelled blood while holding down the heart that was about to jump.That was the entrance, and it seemed like a few people were gathering. I could see Algard and his white gold hair in it.\u201cArgh!\u201dI accidentally moved to the smell of blood and got on with myself with my voice.The gaze of the people at the entrance gathers to the acrylic at once. Among them was still Algard, who, surprised, turned his gaze towards the acrylic.Acrylic looked to Algard as his face was about to turn bright red on his detours, but there were no specifications for what had come out.I didn\u2019t see any trauma on Algard\u2019s body. I realized that the smell of blood did not come from Algard, but from those who were in conversation at the entrance with Algard, and the acrylic had lost its strength from my body. Pepe as it was, and as he sat down, Algard quickly approached him, kneeling.\u201cAcrylic? Why are you out of the room?\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Al\u2019s not coming today, so get anxious\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh well. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think enough.\u201dAlgardo replies to the acrylic he says with a whispering, sorry head bowed, look like he chewed up a bitter bug while scratching his head.\u201cUh, Master Algard. Is that the girl?Then the men, who were watching how Algard and Acrylic were doing, called out at random.They\u2019re apparently a battle outfit, with dirt like they did after the battle, etc. The smell of blood and their injuries were more like blood return than anything else.Acrylic slipped his ear and lowered as he seemed too dumb to jump out that Al might have been injured.\u201c\u2026 ha, you guys. Back off already today. There\u2019s no point in talking about acrylics.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know that. It just doesn\u2019t seem like something that Algard would worry about.\u201d\u201c\u2026 just back off. No, fine. I\u2019m bringing the acrylic back to my room. The report will be submitted later.\u201dAlgard told him to abandon him and held up the body of the acrylic he was sitting on.Hiccup, Algard\u2019s face approaches close range to the vision of a short screaming acrylic. The acrylic face stains bright red at once, understanding that it fits inside Algard\u2019s arms and is being held up.Fly your consciousness so that you are not aware of the sound of your heart bouncing loudly and painfully. It was acrylic resistance to knowing what was going on but not wanting to recognize it.With the acrylic in his arms, Algardo walks back the way the acrylic came.Acrylic lowered his ear and gaze sorry to see if his current state was finally swallowing.\u201c\u2026 sorry\u201d\u201cApologize for what?\u201cLeave the room on your own\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 never mind. I was the one who forgot to take care of acrylics. I had a job in here today.\u201d\u201cWork?\u201d\u201cWe work for demons. It\u2019s a big day. I couldn\u2019t make it to see Acrylic because I was waiting.\u201dDemon thinning. I see, that\u2019s why Acrylic convinced me that he was bleeding back to the point where he smelled so much blood.\u201c\u2026 Al also fights demons?\u201c\u2026 No, I am. I\u2019m not leaving this mansion.\u201d\u201c? Yes, it is?\u201c\u2026 ah. I have to be here.\u201dThat\u2019s how the grin Algard brought to his mind was a grin, but I couldn\u2019t imagine him laughing, and it was a transparent, nothing-making look.Acrylic fell into the sensation as if peering into the invisible hole at the bottom. The look on his face was too pretty, but he was stirred up by unspeakable anxiety and Acrylic accidentally held his fist.\u201c\u2026 Al?\u201cWhat?\u201dIs he aware, or is he aware and stuck? What look do you have on your face?Afraid to hear that, Acrylic shut his mouth. The heat of Algard\u2019s hand holding him tight made me realize he was here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: 83\u201cAcrylic, I have someone I want to meet today\u2026 do you mind?\u201cHuh? Ugh, yeah\u201dThe day after Acrylic left the room, Algard came to Acrylic\u2019s room and cut out the story that way.Although Acrylic made his eyes black and white on Algard\u2019s offer, he admitted that he would not refuse.After confirming that Acrylic\u2019s consent had been obtained, Algard called out across the door.\u201cCome in, Clive\u201dI beg your pardon.It was Clive who came inside. Acrylics, who saw an elderly butler, correct his residence in a frightened manner.\u201cI\u2019ll see you first. I am Clive, the administrator of this hall, an Algard-saint.\u201d\u201cAh, acrylic, sir.\u201d\u201cIn this short period of time we have become accustomed to the words of the Kingdom of Palletia, and we are just amazed. Regards,\u201dClive smiles slightly and gives a thank you. Acrylic nods his neck up and down again and again in a tense manner.\u201cSo, um\u2026 why are you meeting me\u2026?\u201cThe other day, she came to think that Master Algardo was inconvenient with Miss Acrylic. So I was wondering if I could talk to you about your behavior in this hall.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 ah, but yesterday, I left the room, because I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. I don\u2019t think you have any ill intentions. But we also had a position and a situation. I wonder if it would be convenient for me to talk to you to decide how to shake you in the future.\u201dAcrylic nods and shows as he was convinced to listen to Clive. The option of not listening if asked how to shake yourself in the future disappeared from the acrylic.Clive nods and shows as he realizes that Acrylic has taken a listening stance. I thought we\u2019d start talking like that, but Clive was going to start making tea.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a long story, go ahead and do this first\u201d\u201cOh, thanks\u2026\u2026\u201dThe tea Clive put me in gave me an acrylic nose and a pleasant aroma. Where I relaxed to the taste that made me want to exhale, well, Clive starts to cut the story out.\u201cI thought to Miss Acrylic, what did you explain it from first? I hope you know about us first.\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201d\u201cI am the one who has been entrusted by the king of this land with the protection of this land. This is the habitat of demons, the kingdom of Palletia and the pioneering place on the edge\u201d\u201cThe pioneering place means to expand the place where you live\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Exactly. At the same time, it\u2019s to gather the essential resources in this country.\u201d\u201cResources?\u201d\u201cYes. That is the Spirit Stone. Do you know anything about spiritual stones?Spirit Stone. Acrylic tingled at the name and raised his eyebrows to show it.\u201cSpirit stone\u2026 stone with the power of the Spirit, right?\u201cYes. In our country, spiritual stones are used from life to various tools.\u201d\u201cSo I went out of my way to make a mistake in the demonic habitat\u2026 Yeah, I understand.\u201d\u201cYes, and now Miss Acrylic is inviting you to be a guest of Master Algard, because of those circumstances, the building is understaffed.\u201d\u201cUndermanned?\u201cYes, this land, as I said earlier, is a frontier land. And a dangerous place where demons can spread. It\u2019s not enough to be able to work.\u201dCertainly no one in the land adjacent to danger may try to live in hope, Acrylic thinks.For Acrylic, the Ricanto, unlike the inner world, there is a land in the Kingdom of Palletia where we can live more serenity.So it was a convincing story that there were few workers.\u201cSo, Miss Acrylic\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201d\u201cIf you like, aren\u2019t you willing to work in this hall?\u201cMe?Acrylic puts a decent face to the suggestion from Clive.\u201cYes. As I said earlier, this hall is understaffed. There are not enough people at work, and often they can\u2019t get around to it.\u201d\u201cSo you took me?\u201cYes, if you could help me clean and wash your work. Will the rest basically take care of Master Algard around you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Master Algard is about Al, isn\u2019t he?Hitachi Acrylic looks at Algardo with his gaze. Algard, who had left the explanation to Clive, frowned a little before coughing.\u201cOh, my name is Algard, to be exact\u201d\u201c\u2026 is Al a great guy?\u201cYou could be the head of this building.\u201d\u201cClive.\u201dThough Algard says to blame, Clive just shows his shoulders flaunted without looking intentional.Even knowing Algard was the one standing at the top of this hall, there were few surprises for acrylics. Rather, I thought it was natural.\u201cOriginally, if you are Master Algard, it is fine to discourage exclusive squire, but we were understaffed in this peripheral land. That\u2019s where you are, Miss Acrylic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but I\u2019m still not sure how this country works or anything. Still good?\u201cYeah, yeah. You may need to do more than you can, but at first you can just talk to someone about Algard. And I\u2019d appreciate it if you could just take care of yourself and come in for a little chore.\u201dClive smiles and tells Acrylic as he grips his hands together on his desk.Acrylic turns his gaze to Algard in confusion. Algard put the interval aside just to worry a little, then told the sigh.\u201cOf course, I pay my salary. Keep studying and I\u2019ll go out with you. If you don\u2019t like your life here, you don\u2019t have a referral. But even with that introduction, if the acrylic doesn\u2019t have credit and assurance, it\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cIs that a good idea\u2026?\u201cIf I say I don\u2019t like you, I won\u2019t force you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to put my position back on the guest again. It is our request that you work for it, because acrylics must necessarily respond\u2026\u201d\u201cFine, me\u201dAcrylic nodded and showed to block Algard\u2019s words. Algardo frowns at Acrylic\u2019s reply. Clive, on the other hand, has a full grin.Clive stood up and held both hands of the acrylic with both hands as he came to the side of the acrylic.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy.\u201d\u201cUh, welcome\u2026?\u201cI hope Miss Acrylic will act with Master Algard in the future. I think you may leave if you are asked to use something. Are you sure? Dear Algard,\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ll talk to you later. Clive can back off.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll do this as well as prepare for the meal. From now on, as a companion, thank you. Miss Acrylic.\u201d\u201cCompanions\u2026\u201dAcrylic repeats the word companion. Even while he is chewing up the meaning of the word, Clive makes a gratuity and exits the room.After Clive left, a strange silence spread between Acrylic and Algard.\u201c\u2026 Are you sure it was a good idea?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThis is what Clive said. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to work anything else\u2026 but it\u2019s true this hall is understaffed. I admit it\u2019s convenient. But if you think I don\u2019t like acrylics, I\u2019m not gonna force you to.\u201d\u201cHey, Al.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Acrylic calls on Algard as he looks straight into Algard\u2019s eyes to cut off the flow of conversation.Called by acrylics, Algardo stops the words on the way and gazes at them to take a straight acrylic gaze.\u201cAl is actually named Algardo.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh yeah\u201d\u201cThe greatest man in this hall?\u201cThat\u2019s what Clive says on his own.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re a great guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t deny it\u201d\u201cOh well. I don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with why I have to stay here.\u201dTo Acrylic\u2019s inquiry, it is now that Algardo has become silent. I frown as if I were trying to pick a word and put my hands on it to hide my mouth.Acrylic exhaled softly, staring straight at Algard like that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t want you to have to answer that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 acrylic?\u201cAl said you wanted to know about me, didn\u2019t he? Well, then, you can assume I want to know about Al, too, right?There was a smile on the face of nature and acrylics. Algardo blinks his eyes like he was distracted by such an acrylic expression.But the look quickly turns into something that showed confusion. My gaze is diverted from the acrylic as if I were escaping something.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not interested in anything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Al who decides that, is it? It\u2019s me. There\u2019s so much I want to know. Al, so I want to know.\u201d\u201cIs that because I helped acrylics?Shaking his neck left and right, Algard sarcastically grinned and told him to throw it away.\u201cRight. Al helped me, so I want Al to know\u201dAcrylic does not deny that thrown away Algard\u2019s words. On top of that, I said that\u2019s why I want to know.\u201cDon\u2019t you like Al?\u201c\u2026 ah. I\u2019m just letting you down, even if you\u2019re interested. I think Acrylic misunderstands, but I\u2019m not doing anything here. I didn\u2019t do anything to be respected.\u201d\u201cBut Al helped me, didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\u201cIf you want to help, everyone can do it. It just so happens to be me. It\u2019s not something that interests me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u201dTo Algard, who overlaps words to reject, Acrylic clearly now uttered a word of denial.Algard\u2019s gaze, which tended to deviate, is directed again towards the acrylic. Acrylic has never deviated from Algard\u2019s gaze. Again, the gaze intertwines.\u201cSurely what Al did may not be anything special. It could have been done by anyone. But it was Al who blessed me with a meal and gave me knowledge. You call yourself worthless, but you met me when I was in so much pain, you helped me. It\u2019s worth it just to you. Anything anyone could possibly do, Al was the only one who did it for me.\u201dOh, speaking of which. Second, there was something past Acrylic\u2019s brain.I wondered if I had spoken properly.\u201cAl, thank you for your help. I\u2019m so glad I met you.\u201d\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201cEven if it\u2019s not worth it to you, it\u2019s irreplaceable to me. I\u2019m very happy to have met you in my life.\u201dAlgard opens his eyes and stares at the acrylic as he is taken aback. Acrylics just smile at Algardo like that.Surely it could have been something anyone could have done. Still, it was Algard who reached for the acrylic at that moment.That\u2019s why Acrylic thanks Algard. Even if that\u2019s what everyone did, you\u2019re the one who offered me that hand.\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s all I\u2019m ever thankful for.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve done to me for Al. Al thinks that\u2019s what anyone can do. Al\u2019s a good guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not the kind of person to be evaluated\u201dI shook my head hard and gradually got acrylic eyebrows at Algard, who didn\u2019t try to accept me.Acrylic that accidentally takes a seat and walks over to the side of Algard. If I stuffed the distance so as to peek into Algard\u2019s face, I could see for a moment Algard\u2019s crimson eyes shaking in confusion.\u201cI don\u2019t care what Al thinks. But I was still helped by Al, so many times I say thank you! Whatever anyone can do, you\u2019ve become one of them!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cI don\u2019t want Al to tell me.\u201d\u201cHa-ha\u2026! Well\u2026 don\u2019t you want me to tell you? Right.\u201dIn return for the acrylic, Algardo raises his hair with one hand to scratch up his forehead and hides his gaze with his palm. In its mouth, there is a grin that cannot hide the funniest.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m the one who reached out to anyone who can.\u201dAlgard shrugged softly to bite something off. Algard\u2019s mood for words could not be read by acrylics.That\u2019s why the desire to know grows stronger. But not now, I\u2019m sure, when I ask.The acrylic reached out, picking the hem of the opposite hand that hid his face. Very thin, trivial connection.Algard never shook off such acrylic hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84: 84\u201cHey, Al?\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMe, don\u2019t you have to work?Acrylic asked Algard yes. Although I took it upon myself to do my job, I don\u2019t have a job that looks particularly like work just to study the next day.Algardo, questioned by an acrylic, answers as he shifts his posture so that he arms together and leads to the back of the chair.\u201cTaking care of me around me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m doing anything myself, especially\u201d\u201cReally?\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cHmm. But don\u2019t you have to clean it?Remember Clive\u2019s story. Acrylic makes repeated inquiries. Doesn\u2019t this make sense that you\u2019ve been asked to do your job?\u201cClive will ask for it when he needs it. Plus, I need to teach you how to clean. I guess I\u2019ll plant it there when I\u2019m removing it for my use. Besides, what acrylics do today is they study.\u201d\u201cYeah. I know most of the words now, but I need to be able to even speak more.\u201dAcrylic exchanges conversations, but his hands are moving in writing. Writing while having a conversation, because it is parallel, the movement of the hand is the blunt thing acrylic was taken seriously.But it is from acrylics that we shake the subject, and there is nothing to talk about from Algard. It\u2019s just that Algardo is watching the acrylic.\u201c\u2026 Hey, Al\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you free?\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s Al doing?Acrylic asked Algardo, whining bitterly, tilting his little neck.Algard has many mysteries. Apparently, he\u2019s a great guy, but he can\u2019t get out of this hall, and he can take care of the acrylic if he\u2019s free.Algardo gives a subtle look, wondering how to answer an acrylic question.\u201cEspecially, nothing\u201d\u201cIs Al sick or something?\u201c\u2026 what makes you think that?He said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. I don\u2019t know if you can let me.\u201dAlgardo leaves his subtle expression on Acrylic\u2019s anticipation and hands on him to hide his mouth without answering anything.\u201c\u2026 right. Acrylics will be a problem in the future.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a sinner.\u201dAcrylic opened his eyes to Algard, who shrugged and stared at Algard\u2019s face.\u201cSinner\u2026?\u201cAh. So being here is a punishment to pay for that sin.\u201dWhen Algard tells him what to tell him, he deflects his gaze from the acrylic.Acrylic marvels at Algard\u2019s confession, but sees how Algard is doing and feels unspeakably uncomfortable.Disgusting as not coming out of the back of my throat. Acrylic distorted his eyebrows to the point where he seemed to be able to grab it in one more step, but couldn\u2019t reach it.\u201c\u2026 well\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that all?Algardo returns his gaze to the acrylic gavel.Acrylic thought I must be thinking that if it was something more to be said. That\u2019s why I was able to say exactly what I was going to say.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think Al is a bad person because Al is a sinner\u201d\u201c\u2026 I wonder. Maybe not, huh?\u201cIs that a habit?Acrylic distorted his expression to say it was clearly unpleasant. Algard blinked his eyes when the reaction of the acrylic was something he didn\u2019t even think it would be.\u201cHabits?\u201d\u201cYou look like you want to be the bad guy\u201d\u201c\u2026 because, in fact, you\u2019re a bad guy\u201dAlgard groans and makes himself look ridiculous. The smile that floated was the look on Algardo\u2019s face that Acrylic had recently begun to see.That\u2019s what crippled Acrylic\u2019s mind. The Algardo thing that I never tried to get my thanks for before passes through my brain.Al.\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cYou regret your sins, don\u2019t you?Algardo breathed like he had been poked in the void. Acrylic keeps staring at Algard moving.Having noticed the gaze from the acrylic, Algardo slipped away from his gaze at first glance.\u201cLooks like Al wants to be punished.\u201d\u201c\u2026 does that look like it?\u201cVisible\u201dAlgardo covered his eyes with one hand to hide his gaze at the pointing out of the acrylic that could be poked straight at.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know Al. So I\u2019m going to say something\u2026 but I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Algard breathed and turned his gaze away at the acrylic with his hands that were hiding his eyes.There\u2019s a full look of surprise there, but that look quickly turns into a bitter laugh.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019ve been told the same thing\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dMy sister told me the same thing.sister. Acrylic pinned his ear to the word Algard shrugged, and stood up.\u201cSister?\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cYou said the same thing to me\u2026 then I\u2019m sure you\u2019re worried about Al\u201d\u201c- I don\u2019t deserve that.\u201dQuiet, but in a rough tone to slap, Algard ran out of words. Acrylic reveals his surprise at the angry emotions he has never shown before.Soon Algard realized that his emotions had been disturbed, too, and he held his finger between his brows as the punishment seemed bad.\u201c\u2026 sorry. But I wasn\u2019t close to my sister.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201cOh\u2026. maybe I just hated it unilaterally, but yeah\u201d\u201c\u2026 why?I\u2019m not sure about acrylics. Someone named Algard\u2019s sister. The emotions Algardo has towards his sister.That\u2019s why I was curious. Because it was the first time Algard had revealed his emotions so far.\u201cMy sister was brilliant and I was just a falling out\u201dAlgardo opened up plenty of time to pick a word before saying so.The word feels heavy, like a bite. That\u2019s all Algard has in mind, to the point where he feels that way.\u201cBut, Al?\u201c\u2026 what\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a lie that Al doesn\u2019t like your sister.\u201dAlgard turned his gaze toward the acrylic as he saw something odd. I don\u2019t know why Algard is turning such a gaze on acrylics.\u201c\u2026 what makes you think that?\u201cBecause Al doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s more like he\u2019s telling himself. If you don\u2019t like someone and you feel bad about someone, I\u2019ll go out more, normal. But Al isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know?That was a word Algard had reflexively spoken, holding his mouth down as he said he had overlapped his lethargy as well.Acrylic turns his gaze toward Algard as he blinks several times at Algard\u2019s words. Correct your posture and face straight back to Algard.\u201cAl. You can be angry, so listen to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 acrylic?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIf you want me to understand, I won\u2019t know until you tell me to understand. So I want you to talk to Al more.\u201dAlgardo made his shoulders jump on acrylic words. Acrylic continued as he pretended not to notice it.\u201cI want to know about Al. I want to know more and make that breathlessness easier for you. I don\u2019t know about Al, so I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know if Al will hurt, suffer, or be happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you don\u2019t know. Why would you want to do that?\u201cYou want to help, but you have so many reasons?That\u2019s strange, let the acrylic say it out.\u201cMe, I can\u2019t go back to where I was, and I don\u2019t think I can. But I don\u2019t want to die, so I have to live where I can live. And now I\u2019m living next to you. If you\u2019re in pain, I want to help. Is this why Al\u2019s convinced?\u201cEven if it\u2019s not next to me, there\u2019s a way to live. That\u2019s what Clive showed.\u201dThen I\u2019ll choose you.Acrylic stuck to Algard in a frustrating mix. It is this time that Algard turns into a stunned look.An acrylic gaze is intertwined to see something incredible, and an acrylic gaze to Algard.\u201cI\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t have to be me. But that guy\u2019s not in Al right now, is he? Then I will be. To whoever chooses you.\u201d\u201cAre you stupid, you are. I told you I was a sinner.\u201d\u201cWhy would that be?\u201cNah\u2026!?\u201dAlgard unexpectedly loses his word. Acrylic takes his seat and stuffs it to Algard like he says he can\u2019t stand it.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m a sinner who tried to steal, right?\u201c\u2026 oh, that\u2019s\u201d\u201cStill, Al told me I was good here. I can tell you that.\u201c I don\u2019t care about that. \u201c\u201cThe weight of my sins is not like that\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same, any sin. Same thing.\u201dAcrylic stuffed in Algardo brings his face so close that he may feel exhaled.\u201cIt was painful, it was hard, I couldn\u2019t help but breathe. I want to get out of here. I wanted to live, but I wanted to throw it. Hey, what\u2019s the difference? What\u2019s the difference between me and Al?\u201c\u2026 you can just say that because you don\u2019t know\u201d\u201cThen talk to me. I said I want to know. If you really don\u2019t want them to know, you can hide it, right? You can\u2019t hide it anymore. Hasn\u2019t Al noticed? Are you sure this is about you? You\u2019re in pain now, aren\u2019t you?Acrylics overlap words as they desperately complain. The hand reaches out to Algard\u2019s cheek.Acrylic fingers touch Algard\u2019s cheek. Algardo opens his eyes and stares at each other at close range with the acrylic.Algardo\u2019s hand reaches out to the acrylic shoulder. It\u2019s like trying to poke at you, but that arm loses power just by putting a hand on the acrylic shoulder.\u201cHuh, haha\u2026 not at all\u2026 impudent\u201d\u201cAl\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t like minded women. They even reveal what they don\u2019t want to show.\u201dAlgardo weighs in as he puts his forehead on the acrylic shoulder. Acrylic hugs her head so that she can hold it over her head as she takes the weight of Algardo\u2019s body.Though Algard shook his body for only a moment, he quickly pulls out his strength and leaves himself in the acrylic.\u201c\u2026 I had to deny it. But now I don\u2019t have a reason to be mean\u2026\u201d\u201cAl\u2026\u2026?\u201cIt was painful. It was painful to breathe.\u201dWas that, after all, a whining word toward acrylics? Algardo shrugs as if he were dreaming.Algard was like a wandering, weak beast that was going to disappear.Algard couldn\u2019t leave me alone like that, but I couldn\u2019t even think of a word to throw. Acrylic just kept stroking Algard\u2019s head.Algardo\u2019s hand is attached to the acrylic\u2019s back. Acrylic lowered his eyes softly to the sensation of his wrist, weak enough to hold him tight.(\u2026 after all, you couldn\u2019t say anything)Acrylic was alone, whining in his heart as he fell asleep in his room bed.After that, for a while Algardo had kept himself in the acrylic, but Algardo left the room with a word of apology as he had regained his mind.The remaining acrylic hit him back and forth with renewed emotions.\u201c\u2026 I wonder what caused Al so much suffering\u201dToday\u2019s Algardo from acrylic was like a beast of hand. A beast that is weak enough to see, but cannot be left with anyone.It\u2019s so painful and so sad that I can\u2019t cut my chest off. I wanted to do something for you, and every word I could throw at you because I thought so was going to be thin, and at the end of the day, I couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201c\u2026 I wonder if I said anything extra.\u201dUnexpectedly regret passes on his chest, and acrylic holds his head.I wonder what was the right thing to do. I was wondering if that would have been really good for you to do for Algard.It was going to make me sick with endless questions and self-loathing. The solo sumo of such acrylic thoughts was stopped by the sound of a knock.\u201cMiss Acrylic, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Clive.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, yes?Acrylic rose out of bed to the voice heard from across the door and ran out patterned toward the door.When I opened the door, Clive stood there. Acrylics inadvertently get a perfect ear for nervousness.\u201cWas your time good now?\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cHehe, you don\u2019t get nervous like that. It was expected that this would happen in a way. Master Algardo is starting to open his heart to you\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cMaster Algard has my permission. \u2026 let\u2019s talk about Algard.\u201dJust a little bit, though, that would be a long story.It was just that Acrylic would glance at Clive in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then I sit in the seat across the street myself, sitting in a good position.\u201cFirst, what should I tell you from? Shall we speak from Algard\u2019s point of view?\u201d\u201cAl\u2019s position?\u201cYes, Master Algardo\u2019s real name is Algardo Bona Palettia. He was a prince of this country.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Al is the prince. Is that the king\u2019s child?\u201cYes, you\u2019re right\u201dThe fact that Algardo is a prince. Acrylics could take that without much surprise. Still, I blink my eyes a few times to see if the reaction will come on the table if it is spoken again.\u201cThe future was also said to be the next king\u2026\u2026 have you heard anything from Master Algard?\u201cAl says he\u2019s a sinner\u2026\u201dAcrylic squeaks remembering the words Al used to say.Clive nodded back as he exhaled deeply into the acrylic grunt.\u201cYes, Master Algard has sinned. Because of that sin, he was no longer recognized as the next king. Does Miss Acrylic know how big that is?\u201cI was the next chief of this country, but I couldn\u2019t be\u2026. Has Al committed such a great sin?Acrylics still have a faint sense of the size of a country. Because I think in tune with my common sense. Still, when they say they can\u2019t be the next leader, and even more so, they say it\u2019s sinful enough to keep them from going out in the halls of the border lands, they swallow it.How the hell did Algard end up committing such a sin? Acrylic wonders if that also involves his sister, whose heart Algard was disturbing.Clive exhales heavily into the acrylic inquiry before slowly continuing the conversation.\u201cMaster Algard\u2019s sin was to take control of this country as his own.\u201d\u201c\u2026 domination?\u201cYes, the king, his own father, his wife, the queen, nobles and civilians alike.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Al did that?I can\u2019t imagine at all, Acrylic shook his head left or right. From the impression I\u2019ve felt so far, I don\u2019t think Al would think about that.But I don\u2019t think Clive is lying. Even if it\u2019s hard for Acrylic to believe, I feel like that\u2019s what really happened.\u201cI dyed my hands of evil law and I was about to plunge the country into chaos. And Algard disqualified himself from being the next king, and was banished to the land.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s a very incredible face. But it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWhy did Al do that\u2026?I understand the sins Algard committed. The next thing I care about acrylics is motive. What did Algard think, dyed his hands to the evil law and tried to rule the country?Once in acrylic inquiry, Clive stops talking and grabs a cup of tea. Take a sip to moisturize your thirst and the cup is put back on top of the saucer without sound.\u201cMaster Algard had a sister.\u201d\u201cSister\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. by the way, did Miss Acrylic know that this country says magic has flourished?\u201cYeah. Al told me.\u201dThe Kingdom of Palletia is a country where magic is developed. Magic is also deeply involved in its formation, and the nobles use the magical powers inherited from their ancestors for the sake of the people and for the sake of the country. That\u2019s why we reign in a privileged class called aristocracy.And it is the royalty that stands on it. A clan that unites this country, starting with the first king who founded the Kingdom of Palletia.\u201cIn this country, magic can be used, but the more skillful magic is, the more it has been regarded as symbolic of power.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So Al\u2019s sister was an excellent wizard or something?Outstanding sister. And in a country where magic is supposedly expensive to use, Acrylic thought that nature and Algardo\u2019s sister might excel as a wizard.But Clive smiles bitterly and shakes his neck left and right to deny the idea of acrylic.\u201cNo, vice versa. Master Algard\u2019s sister, you couldn\u2019t use magic at all.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cThat must be why. That\u2019s why Algard-sama\u2019s sister showed her a talent that could be described as heterogeneous.\u201d\u201cHeterogeneous\u2026\u2026?\u201cMaster Algard\u2019s sister, Master Anisphere Wynn Palettia, has made it possible to reproduce magic in the form of\u201d tools \u201c, even if it is not noble.\u201d\u201cAs a tool\u2026?Anisphere. Acrylic leaned his neck strangely while remembering that was Algard\u2019s sister\u2019s name.When they call magic a reproduction in the form of a tool, it honestly doesn\u2019t come to pass.\u201cSimply put, we have been able to reproduce magic with tools that only royalty and nobility can use. Even if you\u2019re a civilian, you can use magic with tools developed by Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s amazing\u201dAcrylics cannot use \u201cmagic\u201d. For Ricant, magic was a distant thing. That\u2019s because we couldn\u2019t handle ourselves.That\u2019s why I can only be surprised. Acrylic nods when he also knows very well that Algard said he was an excellent sister to the point of becoming.\u201cThis country will take precedence over boys as the next king. The throne could not have turned to the Anisphere, who could not use magic. But Anisphere has developed an unprecedented technology that has had a huge impact on this country. \u2026 to the point where there is a voice saying that Master Algard should not be the next king of Anisphere.\u201d\u201cIs that good to be forgiven?\u201cNo. What I wanted was part of it, and Master Anisphere didn\u2019t seem to want to be king himself. But we couldn\u2019t ignore Anisphere\u2019s influence.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so Algard tried to be king with all his might\u2026?\u201cThere are fine circumstances, but it would be a less familiar story for Miss Acrylic, who is not a citizen, so it would be good with that perception. And it was also Anisphere who stopped Algard from committing the crime.\u201d\u201c\u2026 your sister who said that anisphere tormented Al?Unable to use magic, a princess disqualified as royal if she were meant to be. A heretic child who has nevertheless developed magic so that anyone can use it in the form of tools.Someone who could have been king until he pushed Algard, who should have been king. People who said they didn\u2019t like Al, but to say they didn\u2019t, they were showing complex emotions.When I wondered if the person was tormenting Algard, my impression of the person named Anisphere of Acrylic did not turn out to be good.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cMaster Anisphere didn\u2019t suffer because he wanted to. That one thought of Master Algard as that one. The bad news is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s the grownups around.\u201d\u201cAdults?\u201d\u201cAristocrats are allowed luxury because of their presence on top. And once you know luxury, people want more luxury. If you are a nobleman, you have more wealth than any other nobleman. Even if you go too far, you become king yourself. And there were those who tried to move Algard so that it was convenient for us.\u201d\u201cOh no\u2026\u201dAcrylics do not know much about the idea that nobility seeks further power. That was because it was an unfamiliar value in Ricant.And since I started telling stories about Anisphere, Clive\u2019s expression changed into something dark. The gaze drops, and the voice grows somewhat lower as it darkens.\u201cWhen I was a child, I was a close sister and brother\u2026 Master Algardo and Master Anisphere\u201d\u201cBut Al doesn\u2019t like your sister\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Algard was not a sad but talented man. This is why I\u2019ve been compared to the Anisphere who can create things no one has ever seen before. It must have been the adults who wanted rights that deepened the conflict between them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not Al\u2019s fault!Acrylic yelled at Clive as he pounded his hand on his desk with momentum. The teacup that was in front of the acrylic jumped and sounded.If Clive\u2019s story is true, he tried to use Al to luxury the adults around him even though he was close as a kid. It was a very incredible place to work.Clive smiled bitterly at Acrylic, who began to tickle in front of him with anger.\u201cYep\u2026 I guess Master Algard isn\u2019t the only one to blame. A lot of people were responsible, and everyone went a little wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Still Al\u2019s sin?\u201cYes, because that is the royalty, the one who stands above men. Of course, those who lost sight of their ambitions and stepped off the road were punished accordingly. But Master Algard is guilty again, even more than he has been confused. The royal family must not be allowed to do that.\u201d\u201cCompared to being on your own, disappointed, trying to use it? Is it bad because they used you? Is it bad because Al wasn\u2019t talented?Acrylic distorted his expression to peel his teeth at Clive\u2019s statement. What floated in Acrylic\u2019s chest was so angry that there was nothing I could do about it.\u201cThat\u2019s so cowardly. It\u2019s wrong to let someone who doesn\u2019t want to do it do the king and only think good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re right. I have no words to say back. We should have supported Master Algard more and stopped by so that his heart wouldn\u2019t be confused. That\u2019s why it is. Miss Acrylic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s why? What?\u201d\u201cPlease, stay with Master Algard. You are not a people of this country. It is not a people that Master Algard had to protect, nor a being that wants to be recognized, but should not be sought out at the earliest. You are Algardo\u2019s guest. Now it\u2019s worth it. That\u2019s what he needs.\u201dClive stares straight at the acrylic and spins his words with a slight tremor in his voice so that he can put his emotions into it.Acrylic takes Clive\u2019s word for it and stares at Clive trying to narrow his eyes. Silence passed between each other, and Acrylic exhaled softly.\u201cMr. Clive, I think it\u2019s probably painful, too. But I don\u2019t know if I can do that favor.\u201d\u201cMiss Acrylic\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Al. Even if I know what\u2019s going on, if I don\u2019t ask Al how he feels, I may not be able to do anything about it. Because\u2026\u201dAcrylic lowered his eyes softly. I don\u2019t know. Shake your head left or right to say so.\u201cAl wants to be saved?\u2026\u2026\u201cEven if it\u2019s painful, if we all made a little mistake, we do have to fix it. But if you fix it, it won\u2019t go away. Pain is not something to forget. Remember, it\u2019s not something you learn?\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRegret and desire to help, I think it\u2019s probably all true. Still, the pain won\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll never forget it. Still won\u2019t go away. I shouldn\u2019t have done anything that wasn\u2019t there. On top of that, if Al wants to be saved, he should talk about it.\u201dNo matter how much you say around you, it\u2019s the person who makes the last decision.So Acrylic thinks it should be Algard who chooses. How do you take someone\u2019s thoughts?\u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it, and no one could show up to Al. That could be me. That\u2019s why I know what Mr. Clive is saying. But that\u2019s why I don\u2019t snort.\u201d\u201cMiss Acrylic\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can only save those who want to be saved. To me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s still good. No, that\u2019s still why. Please keep it that way. I want to keep an eye on what\u2019s coming. Now it\u2019s time to stay on your side\u2026\u201dClive taking a seat and bowing his head deeply. After seeing him, Acrylic lowered his gaze under his lid, exhaling softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t, but the problem was that Acrylic didn\u2019t know Algard\u2019s room.Then Acrylic goes down the hallway with the desire to reopen and find him lice.It was totally night outside and I could see the moon and the stars blinking. I inadvertently stop and look at the sky.\u201c\u2026 acrylic?Acrylic, who was stopping his leg, turned his gaze to the voice calling his name. There was the look of Algard I was looking for.Algard is wondering that Acrylic is here. Acrylic once again faced Algard and tried to say something. Wordless though.Behind Acrylic\u2019s brain passes the Algardo story Clive tells us. Phew, the exhaled breath felt heavy enough myself.\u201cAl, I need to talk to you.\u201dThe word I finally got out was the voice that invites him.Algard\u2019s expression on Acrylic\u2019s words was a grin that seemed to disappear even now, transparent.I had that feeling that something was going to end.It was in his room that Algardo invited in the acrylic. Algard\u2019s room was surprisingly low on furniture.What stands out are the beds for sleeping, rocking chairs and furnishing tables. Acrylic felt cold in the room as if he had no sense of life.I guess it\u2019s because I had the impression from the look Algard gave me earlier. An anxiety had arisen in the acrylic as if Algardo were going to melt and not disappear.\u201cYou heard from Clive?\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. Well, let\u2019s sit down first.\u201dWhether it\u2019s for visitors, Algardo sits acrylic by carrying the chair that was placed in the corner of the room to the table.Sit back across tables from each other. The acrylic wrinkles between the brows wondering how to cut out the conversation.\u201c\u2026 Surprised?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been down a lot. I don\u2019t know if I should have told you myself if I was supposed to. But when it comes to speaking with my own mouth, I\u2019m not sure I can speak calmly. I thought I should talk to Acrylic, but I asked Clive to.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh. Nothing, if Al thought so.\u201dI think it\u2019s natural because I\u2019m a party. Because what he said about Algard was something he experienced himself. I think it was a difficult story to tell you to talk calmly about it.Still, Algardo tried to tell himself. Acrylics never have bad feelings there.\u201c\u2026 how did you tell me?\u201cWhy,\u201d\u201cI think Al still has so much to think about that he can\u2019t talk properly. You may not be able to tell them properly, but you still tried to tell me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026. I guess I still wanted Acrylic to know\u201dAlgard shrugged as he strayed his gaze from the acrylic and wandered his gaze into the void.It\u2019s like staring somewhere that\u2019s not here. And it closes to hide those crimson eyes.\u201cKnow, I don\u2019t even know why I want it. I just wanted Acrylic to know who I really am.\u201d\u201cReal Al?\u201cI couldn\u2019t be just Al. My name is Algardo Bona Palettia. He was the prince who had to lead the future of this country. And\u2026 a sinner who gave it all up\u201dAlgardo speaks in a pale voice. It\u2019s like dry, in a voice that doesn\u2019t even make you feel emotional.Still, the expression with thin open eyes slightly lifted the edge of the mouth represents a complex emotion.I don\u2019t want to speak to my voice, but I give it to my expression. Acrylic feels Algardo\u2019s intricate emotions as if it were a tiny Algardo.I\u2019m sure you mean what you want to hide, but you also mean what you can\u2019t hide. They\u2019re both true and they\u2019re lies, so Al says he doesn\u2019t know who he is anymore.\u201c\u2026 I was obsessed. Not when you have a plan.\u201d\u201cPlan? You tried to control the country, talk about it?\u201cOh, it seemed so fascinating. I\u2019ve always had a hard time breathing. It\u2019s all you ask for, it\u2019s all you can\u2019t respond to, and then you\u2019re just given. It was like there was only a vessel there called me, and I wasn\u2019t in that vessel, and it felt like I was watching from behind.\u201dAcrylic listens to Algardo, who talks about it in a pompous way.\u201cThat\u2019s the prince, he said, to be king. Everything I was given\u2026 must have been love. status, a rich life, and a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201c\u2026 fianc\u00e9e?\u201cHmm? Oh, you weren\u2019t talking. If you\u2019re a prince, you have a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that what this is all about?We didn\u2019t have that kind of relationship.\u201c\u2026 you didn\u2019t like it?\u201cYou rather hated it\u201dNow the acrylic voice had become pale. Are you aware of that or not?But Algard has nothing to point out. I just had a bitter laugh when I remembered her as my fianc\u00e9e.\u201cIn flattery, I couldn\u2019t say I was good. Anxious about the responsibility of entrusting the country, the fathers addressed an excellent girlfriend\u201d\u201cYou were an amazing person?\u201cAh. More than I can compare. It was complete, perfect, unscrupulous.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026 didn\u2019t you like it?\u201cOh. She\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s in my hands. Which fianc\u00e9e are we talking about? I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a part when I was with her.\u201dparts, acrylic frowned at the word. What kind of person does that make you think you are?\u201cI\u2019m not a bad guy. Instead, I did a terrible job on her, too. I regret it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 didn\u2019t you like it after all?\u201cWe could be friends, in that sense. To be my partner, I can clearly say no now\u201dAlgard\u2019s mouth, telling him so, was not a bitter smile, but turned into a gentle smile. You close your eyes and think of the past, that face looks nostalgic and fun somewhere.I don\u2019t like it. But I might have liked it. As a friend. But as a partner, I said no. But suppose you two had to be united as a couple\u2026\u201c\u2026 you didn\u2019t make it\u201d\u201cOh, right. A lot.\u201dAcrylic also dropped his gaze on Algard\u2019s words about various things.It\u2019s like a misrub. Yet the stitched shape remained distorted without flaking. Even though I won\u2019t go back to what has become a distorted form.\u201cI wish I could have accepted everything. I don\u2019t think about it, I don\u2019t think about it, I just think I\u2019m happy about it. That\u2019s what I need to do. It\u2019s strange to have doubts.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. I was dazzled, that guy\u201d\u201cThat guy?\u201cSister.\u201dThe acrylic accidentally made my heart jump.Who can\u2019t be ignored for Algard. his sister, Anisphere Wynn Palettia.If its existence were to be spoken out of Algard\u2019s mouth, it would become natural. However, acrylic can be distracting.Because Algard\u2019s expression was more calm than ever. I even felt that warmth, as if I was taking out a treasure and looking at it.\u201cI\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve always admired that guy\u201d\u201cTo your sister\u2026?\u201cOh, my first memory was on my sister when I got my mind on it.\u201dI still remember. Algardo\u2019s tone sounds very gentle.\u201cWe were both often pissed off. With all the impotence and the lack of clapping. But that was kind of asexually fun\u2026 and it was normal to go around on my sister\u2019s back.\u201d\u201cAl\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBack then, it was the best time to be myself\u2026 and say I was happy\u201dClose your eyes, slowly so you can bite them off. so as to ascertain that thought.\u201cBut my sister pushed me away. Now that I think about it, I guess I had no choice. My sister was out of the way for me to be king. That\u2019s what my sister herself thought. I really couldn\u2019t reach out to anyone I wanted.\u201dDeep, deep regret sound. I can\u2019t find a word to spit out, even though I\u2019m about to scream out impulsively. That\u2019s why Acrylic bit my lip.I don\u2019t like Algard\u2019s words from the heart that I won\u2019t even fix. Like shaking the heart of an acrylic.\u201cI betrayed that end. Responsibility, family, everything. What does this say without saying sin? I\u2026 am a sinful person. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re forgiven. You\u2019re an empty person.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dAcrylic pinched his mouth to Algard\u2019s words.The gaze immersed in Algard\u2019s past is directed towards the acrylic now in front of him.There were zero tear grains falling from the eyes of the acrylic. Just one drop. But Algard was deprived of his gaze by Shizuku, who fell while leaving traces of tears behind.\u201cEmpty people don\u2019t think about what\u2019s wrong with them. Al is not empty or anything. I just couldn\u2019t put my thoughts in my mouth.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you crying, acrylic\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cry. \u2018Cause Al, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re a really, really beautiful person.\u201dAcrylic smiled softly like that. Algardo doesn\u2019t know why acrylics smile. All I can do is look into the acrylic unexpectedly.Softly Acrylic lays his hands on his chest and lays his gaze down.\u201cAl\u2019s heart looks so beautiful. I\u2019m glad I met someone like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 can\u2019t I think of myself that way?\u201cYeah, so the sad thing is, there were no people around to keep you out.\u201dOpen the eyes where the acrylic was lying down. Another drop of eyes moistened by tears, drops tears.But I don\u2019t feel sad. It\u2019s just beautiful tears.\u201cHey, Al.\u201dThis is what Algard thought.If you talk about your past, you\u2019re either despised or sympathetic.Sad is what acrylics say. But I don\u2019t see the color of sadness in my voice or in my expression.It\u2019s just a gentle look. He said his gaze of softness was tangling him up.Her voice calling the name she told me, I can\u2019t get it out of my ear anymore.\u201cWhat kind of person does Al want to be?The word.Just one word of that.That\u2019s all I could do, but I punched a wind hole in Algard\u2019s heart.A surprising wave of emotion falls from the hole.Was it joy, sadness or anger?I don\u2019t even know myself. An indistinguishable emotion shook Algard\u2019s throat.\u201c\u2026 I am\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I could walk away with my sister, I wanted to be like that. I have no ideals or dreams. I don\u2019t have the power to make it happen.\u201dIt was the best I could do to keep my voice from shaking. There are also thoughts that you will notice with your mouth.Sister. Someone who is free everywhere, out of standard everywhere, and who doesn\u2019t understand himself at all.I still remember things about your back. I saw that back again and again, even when the distance was away.I know enough to say that I\u2019m mediocre that I don\u2019t like it the most.But still.\u201cThe dream my sister showed me was glowing to me. So\u2026\u2026! If you don\u2019t have the talent, you didn\u2019t have to use magic! If you can use magic to keep your sister away! You looked at me, if that gaze is about to go off\u2026\u2026! I didn\u2019t need anything!\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cAll I ever wanted was that\u2026 I\u2019ve been admiring that guy\u2019s dreams\u201dSo I was scared when my sister found out she might hate herself.He wants to kill himself, actually, that\u2019s what he might think. That was a shock to my young self.And my sister left. Disappear from the front stage to make yourself king.The days after that guy\u2019s gone are just gray, in days when I can tie him to duty.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.In living those days myself, that guy was just free. I flew everywhere by myself.Was that what you hated? Or was it regrettable or sad?Most importantly, the memories that were dear to me became fiercely expensive like burning bamboo.But I don\u2019t really want to hate you. He just wanted to keep an eye on the dream.\u201cI\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to be a king to hurt my sister.\u201d\u201cAl wanted to be a supporter of your sister\u2019s dreams.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. Right. I wanted to support him in his dream.\u201d\u201cI can do it now.\u201dAcrylic takes his seat softly. Stand next to Algard and overlap your own hands with Algard\u2019s.\u201cPerhaps that was unacceptable to you, Prince. Maybe it was difficult. But what\u2019s wrong with Al wanting to support your sister?\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201cBackup, let\u2019s do it. If that\u2019s all, there\u2019s something I\u2019m sure I can do without telling you directly. Because Al is so sorry and bitter that he thinks he can\u2019t do anything about his sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I betrayed you.\u201d\u201cRight. But it was your sister who betrayed you first. It was your sister who left Al.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 yes. That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure it is. But\u2026 can\u2019t your sister forgive Al now?Algardo opens his eyes to acrylic pointers\u2026. and smiled bitterly.\u201cNo\u2026 that guy is sweet.\u201d\u201cYeah. Al backs you up, you don\u2019t like it?\u201cTrouble, maybe. Now they might say,\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re even angry at me for supporting you?\u201c\u2026 no. Not like that.\u201d\u201cYeah. I hope so.\u201dAcrylic entangles his fingers in Algard and his overlapping hands. Bend over to gaze at Algard and peek into his face.\u201cAl, you can support your sister. You can be like that. Look, it\u2019s not empty anymore.\u201d\u201cAcrylic\u201d\u201cBecause you are\u2026 just Al, right?Acrylic\u2019s face, smiling like that, was warped. Algard\u2019s vision was distorted, to be precise.One blink, the heat and Shizuku coming up from the back of my eyelid, made me realize that I had shed tears.Acrylic, who was clearly visible again, was smiling gently.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m really stupid. He\u2019s the one who stops being human to rule the country, isn\u2019t he?\u201cReally?\u201cI could attract people, I asked for the help of vampires.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, Al was\u201d\u201cYou know a vampire?\u201cYeah. Well, I\u2019ve been in Ricant, and I\u2019m not the one you don\u2019t know. We weren\u2019t involved with each other.\u201d\u201cAfter all, Raini\u2019s mother\u2026 no, is that story good now\u201dAlgardo smiles bitterly when he reveals his secrets but is returned as if nothing had happened.I want to pursue what Acrylic seems to know about vampires, but I\u2019m not talking about them right now.\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me I\u2019m still pretty?\u201cYeah. Al just couldn\u2019t form it. I just don\u2019t think I was allowed to. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s not what princes were allowed to do, is it? But right now, Al doesn\u2019t even have to be a prince, does he?\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s right\u201d\u201cThen you can stay beautiful already. Al can take care of that thought.\u201dAlgard\u2019s eyes intertwine acrylic eyes with his gaze. The heat of the gripping hands makes each other feel present.Algard reaches out and holds the acrylic toward him, not holding it together.Acrylic, embraced by Algardo as he fell in, blinked and looked up at Algardo\u2019s face at a closer distance.\u201c\u2026 acrylic\u201d\u201cAl?\u201d\u201cMe too, I think you\u2019re beautiful\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. Thank you, I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cAh. You are, truly beautiful. As much as my sister showed me the world.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so I want you\u201dAcrylic shook his body at the sound of a pleading voice that he truly sought.Algardo\u2019s hand hugging the acrylic holds the acrylic strong. Like saying you don\u2019t want to let them get away with it.\u201cThat could be just one word. But you were the one who gave me that word.\u201d\u201cAl said I should be someone Al wants to be?\u201cAh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well\u201d\u201cWith you, I feel like I can breathe in this world. It\u2019s obvious, but I couldn\u2019t even do that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Al. Do you like me?Acrylic asks Algard to look up at him in an up-and-coming manner.Algard stuffs his breath for a moment, but exhales and tells, as he perceived.\u201cI don\u2019t know, not yet\u2026. but I also want to like you and think you\u2019ll like me.\u201d\u201cOh well\u2026. Hey, Al?\u201cWhat?\u201cMatch, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh well. Really?\u201dUnwrapping the fingers of his tangled hands, Acrylic leans against Algardo to lean over.Algardo regains the body of such an acrylic and delivers it into his arms.\u201cYou made me, I want to love you. I want to be my only one.\u201d\u201cWhatever anyone could do, it was you who did it to me. It must be the only one.\u201d\u201cIf this encounter is the only one for each other\u2026 if we think the same way\u201d\u201cYeah. Together, I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026 will I like you\u201d\u201cAl doesn\u2019t want the kid he likes to like himself?Algardo frowns for a moment at the acrylic smiling like a prank. And close your face so you can bury it in the acrylic shoulder mouth.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to be able to do something about it because I like acrylics more than you like me\u201d\u201c\u2026 complacent, but isn\u2019t it too late?\u201c\u2026 maybe\u201d\u201cWell, that too\u2026 I guess you\u2019re in line. I\u2019m having a really bad heart right now.\u201d\u201cSounds like\u2026\u201dAlgardo laughs with his face buried in the acrylic shoulder mouth as he trembles his throat.Acrylic closed his eyes as he turned his hand around Algard\u2019s back like that.He said it was going to work out. The warm relationship must be over.So much so that it\u2019s going to be more intense, hot, and painful.\u201cI like you, too. Al.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87: 87\u201cDarren, I\u2019m sorry. Please come.\u201d\u201cFine, Prince. So what are you doing calling me all of a sudden?Darren had been summoned to the office used by Algard in the mansion.Even the office is a room for Algardo to check the results of ex-post reports and studies, so it is the current situation that serves as a storage room for reports and materials.Algard sends his gaze to Darren as he elbows the desk. So Darren raised his eyebrows slightly.Darren\u2019s knowledge of Algard was always faceless. He was a man who made me feel more shady than cautious so as not to put my emotions on the table intentionally.What\u2019s wrong with that? Do you see a clear light of will in its eyes and a slightly softer expression? Darren looked carefully at Algard to see what this change meant.\u201cDarren. Actually, what do you say? Is this land going to work?\u201cWhat the hell kind of blow? You never cared about that before.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. That later. So, what do you say?\u201cThank you very much, by mistake. We\u2019re understaffed, and there\u2019s no reason to get more. It must not be futile to have a taste because there is a precedent like\u201d Black Forest \u201d. The location and conditions are not good.\u201dThe Black Forest is still being explored and can be used as a resource mining site because it allows the Knights to stay.But in this part of the border, the role of the Knights is defensive in addition to the extraction of resources. The truth is that you can\u2019t turn your power to mining. Algard and the others are taking the initiative to make a big difference there.\u201cSo can we see that as long as we have all the fighting power, we can expect something in return?\u201cThat\u2019s, well. This place is still untapped.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026. Hey, Darren. As a matter of fact, I know one person who\u2019s going to be instant.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cStrength, yes. It\u2019s one step worse than that sister, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s more than my sister\u2019s power to deal with it extensively.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?Darren caught the edge of his lips looking funny at Algard\u2019s words and showed them.\u201cIf such a man joins us as a force of war, we can see hope that we can reach out to mining.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cBut which one is it? He is.\u201d\u201cSomeone close to you.\u201d\u201cJust kidding.\u201dDamn, Darren snorted his throat, and now it\u2019s time to zero his laugh.The fact that Algard also has an invincible look on his face has led Darren to laugh.\u201cWhat kind of change of heart is that? Because I\u2019m gonna stop pulling?\u201cOh. What, when I thought it was time to move on with research in the field. If you\u2019re blunt, you\u2019ll lose the value of the corners, right? So, what do you say? You think I\u2019m gonna be a force for war in your eyes?\u201cThat\u2019s the joke. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to fight that Marauder right in front of him.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that good?Darren asks to make a push. There is no grin on that look, it shoots straight through Algardo with something seriously tight.While under Darren\u2019s gaze, Algard rises with his hands on the desk. Look at your own hand, hold your fist, and then Algard tells you.\u201cI remember.\u201d\u201cWhat? What?\u201cI was your sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026 blah, hahahaha!! Hino, hi-ha-ha!! Oh, are you going to kill me laughing?!?\u201dDarren laughed out loud with her belly holding her belly to say she couldn\u2019t stand it this time.Even if Darren is laughing until tears come to mind, Algard doesn\u2019t look offended either. I\u2019m rather good enough to put my arms together and show them.\u201cWhat are you reopening?!\u201cIs that bad?\u201cCome on? I don\u2019t know about that one. So, what do you want from the prince of your sister and son?\u201cFrom now on, spiritual stones will be indispensable for the governance of my sister. I\u2019m going to start with it first.\u201d\u201cIs that what the prince decided to do?\u201cOh\u2026. and\u201dAlgard continues as he distorts the look of reopening to Darren and scratches his nose head with illumination.\u201c\u2026 if you don\u2019t dress up a little, you\u2019ll look great\u201d\u201cOoh, ooh. Didn\u2019t you say\u201d no hands \u201c?\u201cI\u2019ve decided to stop being held captive by the past.\u201dAlgard says with a slightly bitter mixed grin at the teasing Darren inquiry.I wonder if that\u2019s the word Darren asked me the other day, and because it includes other meanings. Darren unwittingly narrows her eyes.I didn\u2019t think the day would come when I could hear that word from that Algard.\u201c\u2026 is that right?\u201d\u201cAh. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t that difficult. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh. Then you\u2019re welcome, Prince.\u201d\u201cOh, I need a mouthful from you, too.\u201d\u201cGuys, you\u2019re not saying no, are you? Anyway, I want to borrow your cat\u2019s hand.\u201d\u201cI know something about you.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u2026 Oh, is that why you want to look good\u201dThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.Understanding what Algard\u2019s words meant, Darren glanced over his shoulder and showed him.It\u2019s blue, and. Yes, whining in my heart.\u201cAl!\u201dAfter finishing the discussion with Darren, Algard was out into the mansion\u2019s garden. Acrylics were waiting there.If Acrylic finds what Algard looks like, he rushes over to fly straight. An acrylic with momentum jumps straight ahead and comes towards Algard.He opens his eyes a little before Algardo takes the acrylic. One step, I pulled my leg, but I was able to take it safely. Zero breath of relief, yet I can hold on to the acrylic I\u2019ve been holding.\u201cDamn\u2026\u2026 you seem to be feeling better\u201d\u201cYeah! \u2018Cause this one\u2019s for real!\u201cI\u2019m hoping. I got a good story on this one.\u201d\u201cOh well. Well, here we go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh yeah\u201dPut down the acrylic that was holding him, and Algard stroked his head. As he narrowed his eyes to the touch of his wolf ear, the acrylic was also closing his eyes comfortably.They had done so for a while, but they let go of the hand that Fu and Algardo had been stroking Acrylic\u2019s head.\u201c\u2026 once you decide, don\u2019t be surprised how easy it was.\u201d\u201cAl?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always been something I want to do. I just didn\u2019t want to think so, because I knew that would not be tolerated. But this is what I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I feel like I\u2019m laughing naturally right now.\u201dAlgardo takes acrylic hands. Drop your mouth on the back of your hand as it is.Acrylic is staring at Algardo, who has spoken in his hand with his face. Noticing the look on Acrylic\u2019s face, Algardo frowned and laughed as troubled.\u201cMouth on the back of your hand shows respect.\u201d\u201cOh well. That\u2019s what it means.\u201d\u201cIn the meantime, let me teach you how aristocracy works. Acrylic still has something to teach you.\u201d\u201cYeah. Tell me a lot about it, about your studies, about Al.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cOh. Me too, I\u2019d like to know more about you. Acrylic.\u201dOn the look of acrylic smiling with pleasure, Algardo smiles full face so that he is caught as well.The two of them were smiling at each other, but Fu and Algardo reached for the acrylic cheeks. Keep your fingers around your cheeks and your fingers slide ahead of you as you pass on your chin.Lifting Acrylic\u2019s jaw to make him look up, Acrylic stiffened himself only for a moment, but closed his eyes and deposited himself with Algard.Algardo leans on his lips as he pecks the lips of an acrylic with his eyes closed. Short mouthing, just touching each other\u2019s heat.\u201c\u2026 mouthful, what does that mean?\u201cThat\u2019s something I don\u2019t have to teach you.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me?Algardo\u2019s eyebrows distort in acrylics that tearfully laugh to show his teeth. I closed my eyes firmly as it was and slowly exhaled after stopping the movement for a while.\u201c\u2026 I like you\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. hehe, shy, dude\u201d\u201cLet me tell you something. Say it often.\u201d\u201c\u2018Cause you\u2019re not interested in kids, are you?\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026!\u201cSo look at me, right? I will always be.\u201dAcrylic reaches out and grabs Algard\u2019s cheek with both hands and mouths him to stretch his back.However, the acrylic frowned uncomfortably making a small, tooth-bumped noise. Algard, who saw it, smiled unbearably.\u201c\u2026 you\u2019re just a kid\u201d\u201cOh, shut up!\u201cYou can grow it carefully, but surely you shouldn\u2019t have thought you could be free?\u201c\u2026 Al would be fine\u201dPepper, Acrylic says as he lays down his ear and strays from his gaze. Seeing its cheeks stained with pearls, Algardo glanced down at his eyebrows.Acrylic glances back at Algardo, who shivered slightly, to see if he was laughed at. However, his vision is filled with Algard.\u201cMe too, good acrylic\u201d\u201c\u2026 ugh, hmm\u201d\u201cEven myself, I\u2019m surprised. \u2026 I wondered if I could love people so much.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAcrylic closes her eyes and gently deposits herself in Algardo, where she can force herself to scratch.A soft breeze blew into the garden. Gently, like caressing the two of you gently.and and. The sound of the tip of the pen tapping the desk echoes in the quiet office.It is Uphilia, the young new queen of the Kingdom of Palletia, who returns the pen to the pen stand with his sigh. She adds her fingers from tiredness or rubbing the wrinkles that were leaning between her eyebrows.\u201c\u2026 you have a headache. The price of spiritual stones is soaring\u2026\u2026 it is inevitable that it will have an impact, but it is also here that we make the people feel bad. To delay the deployment of the Knights\u2019 magic props\u2026\u201dToday, only Uphilia is in the office because his assistant, the late King Orphans, is also on leave. Troubled, she sticks it out in her mouth and puts it out.Uphilia was concerned that the spread of magic had increased the demand for spiritual stones, and that the effect of spiritual stones, which continued to spike in price as a result, began to twitch on the table.I don\u2019t want to stop the momentum of demand, but I can\u2019t shake a sleeve without it. Because we cannot afford more than the limited resources we can acquire.Excuse me, Your Majesty.\u201cYes? You may come in\u201dSecond, the sound of the door knocking on Ufiria\u2019s ear, which was sighing in troubles.If I gave permission to enter, Matthew, the Knights of Kingsguard, stood there. Matthew walks over to Uphilia after a thank you.\u201cHead of the Sprout Knights. Can I help you?\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m on my way to government. But I\u2019d like to show this to Her Majesty the Queen.\u201dWith that said, it\u2019s a single letter Matthew gave to Uphilia. Uphilia blinks suspiciously at the letter offered.\u201cWhat about this one?\u201cThis is a letter delivered to the Kingsguard Knights via the Knights of the Borders\u201d\u201cFrom the border\u2026? Which one is it?\u201cIf you look through your eyes, you\u2019ll understand.\u201dUphilia tilted her neck at Matthew\u2019s words, which included laughter somewhere, but took the letter offered and looked through.And the look on Ufiria\u2019s face changed in many ways. At first he opened his eyes full of surprise, then zeroed his exhale to say he couldn\u2019t believe it, and dropped his gaze with an indescribable look.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cA gift, should I say?\u201dMatthew tells Uphilia in a calm voice with a look like he doesn\u2019t know what to put on his face.Ufiria gently glances with her fingers to ascertain the contents of the letter. It is a new mining site for spiritual stones, and informs them that it is possible to dedicate as many spiritual stones as possible compared to normal years.Uphilia then narrows her eyes and touches them to see the last sentence.\u201cDear Sister, To Improve\u201dWhat does that word mean? Ufiria had difficulty choosing her facial expression and whined as she turned out to be a difficult face to describe.\u201c\u2026 to Anis, I have to show you\u201dWhat would that man look like? Uphilia\u2019s mouth, whining so, was grinning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Several face each other and hold meetings to decide on one subject. But the meeting didn\u2019t go on and everyone was looking at each other.That\u2019s why the word resonated so strongly. Everyone turns their gaze to those who cut through the air of stalling meetings. Some nod as they agree, while others skew their faces to indicate a difficult color.\u201c\u2026 I know what you\u2019re trying to say. But it is.\u201d\u201cBut what? You\u2019ve become a very careful man.\u201d\u201cThink about your current public opinion and speak up!\u201cAfter thinking about it, I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t make any sense to keep your hands around me.\u201dAgainst those who roughed up their voices out of frustration, the cut off returned words to poke at them. Not only those who roughed up their voices, but also those with the same ideas as him, distort their faces.\u201cIndeed, we have lost our previous power. But is that why we live round our backs? You\u2019re not, are you? We are proud. This is what it takes to regain our pride.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cShit! It\u2019s a seat for what, not just a seat given away. This seat has been taken over! Then let me argue with that responsibility and pride as much as I can convince!No one speaks out against that voice. The quiet meeting hall had already become his private venue.\u201cThe time has already passed. The more time is available, the less effective this measure will be. It\u2019s time to get up.\u201d\u201c\u2026 so I guess you take responsibility when you make a mistake?Someone shrugged, as I said remorse. Make that whine sound like laughing with your nose.\u201cAbsolutely. My name is the Voltaire family.\u201dThat being said, man, Lang Voltaire kept his sharp gaze and said so with a determined eye.\u201cOne, two, three\u2026\u201dIn the courtyard of the outhouse I was bareback. I don\u2019t know when there will be an assault on my mother, and I can\u2019t be lazy because I don\u2019t have anything to do.Um, but if I can spare you time like this, I\u2019d also like to return to being an adventurer, wondering if Uffi would allow the boulders? Now I want to study it, and I\u2019m going to say that Uffi will give me the budget.Wait till one day, I think that\u2019s the story. Well, you can only be prepared, and it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t blunt your body. Workout, workout.\u201cAh, Master Anis. Was it this way?\u201d\u201cThat, Raini? What\u2019s the matter with you?Working out in the courtyard, Raini called out. Why would Raini be here when he was supposed to be working at the Royal Castle today?\u201cMaster Uphilia called, please climb the castle\u201d\u201cHuh? You want me to climb the castle? That\u2019s unusual.\u201dBeing kept away from government, I rarely plan to climb the castle. When my father was king, I never felt so summoned, and if I didn\u2019t have to, I wouldn\u2019t have leaned on him, so I feel fresh the other way around.But was there something called calling me? Looking at Raini doesn\u2019t seem like an urgent project.\u201cBy the way, climbing a castle, right from now on?\u201cNo, he wants you to come to the office in about two minutes.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm. Okay, I guess after I sweat and change. You can go back to Raini if you want.\u201d\u201cYes. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201dRaini was leaving with a smile and a brilliant courtesy. Since I started going to the royal castle, Raini has been sophisticated in its operation. I still remember when Raini was a samurai apprentice. Time flies fast.Well, if I\u2019m relaxed too, I\u2019ll be late for the time specified for Uffi, so I need to get ready.\u201cI have been waiting for you, Your Royal Highness the King of Anisphere\u201dAfter finishing his duties, he climbs the castle and is greeted by the royal maids. Compared to when I was called a princess, somehow it feels like I\u2019m well treated as a royal, too.That\u2019s not why I\u2019m so tight. I don\u2019t think I can stay a kid on a boulder.Sister Wang, you have to be firm enough to think you deserve to be called that.\u201cThank you for letting me through.\u201dWell, what can I do for you, Yuffi? I\u2019ll go inside while you open the office door.Uffi and Father sat on the couch for visitors to the office. What a Miguel it was to be in that opposite seat.I saw a face I didn\u2019t think I would. I unwittingly round my eyes. What are you doing, Miguel?\u201cAnis, I\u2019m sorry I called you\u201d\u201cFine. And why would Miguel?\u201cHa ha, because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s keeping this one\u201dMiguel says with a smile without his usual grasp. As usual, I sit on the sofa for visitors too, thinking.After confirming that I have lowered my back, your father will look out for Uffi. Uffi also nods to respond, then coughs before he starts talking.\u201cI called Anis because I actually had a consultation\u201d\u201cConsultation? Could it be a sudden story?If I wanted to talk to you, I thought I could do it even after I got back out of the palace, but when I asked if it might be a rush project to say that Miguel was there, it wasn\u2019t Yuffi who answered.\u201cMore info from me. First of all, I was asked to take care of Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the King.\u201d\u201cAsked? To whom?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Spirit Ministry.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the Ministry of the Spirit? Anyway, Yuffi, to me?I see Yufi and Father\u2019s face with the face that I cannot believe. Uffi gave me a troubled look and nodded small. Father remains silent with an expression close to the top of the Buddha.I guess going through Miguel means I really want to talk to you. But that spiritual ministry? Anyway, if you want to talk to Yufi about something, give it to me? Why is that?\u201cBeing confused is a natural reaction if you think about what you\u2019ve been up to, can you listen to me?\u201cUgh, yeah. What kind of story is that the Spirit Ministry wants to take after me and Uffi?\u201cIt\u2019s a story that Her Majesty the Queen has to approve, but your destiny is yours. Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?I was taken aback by Miguel\u2019s words, and he made a distracted voice. No, I don\u2019t know what it means more and more. So the purpose of the spiritual ministry is to negotiate with me?I don\u2019t know what to say myself, but I don\u2019t have a good relationship with the Spirit Ministry. Even if they bring in negotiations this way, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking. I can\u2019t even imagine.Naturally for my reaction, Miguel is nodding, as he said. Miguel holds his hands together and continues the conversation with his elbows on his knees.\u201cThe confusion of Her Royal Highness Sister Wang is especially true, but in the first place, it can be said that the relationship between the Ministry of the Spirit and Her Royal Highness Wang is not good.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how close I am to flattering you\u2026 but did something go wrong?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. Well, Sister Wang. In the first place, do you remember how the Spirit Ministry, formerly the Ministry of Magic, was founded?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cRemember what I told you. I wanted the Ministry of the Spirit to divide my work with those who embraced the magic of the former Ministry of Magic, and to be responsible for compiling, storing and preserving the materials that were recorded during the Ministry of Magic\u2019s time.\u201dIt was me and Uffi who separated what was originally a large organization called the Ministry of Magic. People who embraced magic and willingly worked for the Ministry of Magic, and people who were difficult to embrace aristocraces and magic who were serious about traditional spiritual beliefs were only renewed with signs.The contents of the work were originally measures to move the work that had been contracted by the Ministry of Magic to more full-time and specialized work. Of course, I assumed there were people who didn\u2019t accept me because my voice as a political faction was going to fall.\u201cYeah, Sister Wang is right about the role of the Spirit Ministry right now. And I took on the intermediary to ask Her Royal Highness Wang\u2019s help for their business.\u201d\u201cTo me? No, how did that happen\u2026? Or what is the spiritual ministry going to do?\u201cAnis, the Spirit Ministry wants to lead your birthday.\u201dIt was your father who pinched his mouth. To the extent that my jaw seemed to fall off to the words said by my father, who remained on the top of the Buddha, I opened my mouth and stunned.What, that spiritual ministry? You want to lead my birthday? What, are you serious?\u201cWait, wait. Huh? In the first place, my birthday\u2019s over, right? Besides, it\u2019s my birthday\u2026 I\u2019ve been doing that since I gave up my right to inherit the throne, haven\u2019t I?Yes. For once, I have relinquished my right to inherit the throne. Then, as a royalty, he was treated as someone who had left no place but was practically immaterial. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never had a birthday since then.That\u2019s royal birthday can be mentioned as one of the aristocratic socials, and I know it was celebrated when Al was there. But to be honest with me, I thought it didn\u2019t matter anymore\u2026\u201cSo what is it?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of the Spirit wants to improve relations with His Royal Highness Sister Wang, and for that reason has submitted a plan to Her Majesty that Her Royal Highness Wang\u2019s Birthday should be held again. Suddenly, even if the Spirit Ministry came out to explain its intentions, you wouldn\u2019t even listen to me.\u201d\u201cImproved relationship with me ~ ~?\u201dI accidentally got a weird voice. Now the thought boils down in me.No, I\u2019ve changed my name already, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna feel like doing something like that because I think they\u2019ve seen a lot of pain in their eyes with Yuffi becoming a queen. It\u2019s true I was a problem, isn\u2019t it?But even if they tell me you want to make up with me from over there, well, honestly, I\u2019m in trouble\u2026\u201cHere\u2019s what the Spirit Ministry has to say. The Ministry of the Spirit assumes the role of preserving culture and inheriting tradition. Then perhaps we should once again perform the Birthday Festival of His Royal Highness Sister Wang, whom we have been scorning.\u201dOh, is that why your father looks sinister? Even though it\u2019s one of the factors that made me a pain in the ass when I was in the Ministry of Magic.But I can see the story. Surely the spiritual ministry, honestly, doesn\u2019t have a good reputation, does it? Now that me and my good friend Uffi are about to take office as queen or that magic science is officially about to begin as a national cause, the contempt that was once directed at me is gone, and instead there is bad feelings toward the Spirit Ministry.I deserve it, not that I don\u2019t feel like it\u2026 No, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t care if the Spirit Ministry tells me to cooperate\u2026\u201cUh-huh, no, yeah. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I think you should do it. If you\u2019re going to do it, I don\u2019t even know what the Spirit Ministry is saying.\u201dThe Spirit Ministry is clearly seen to have been pushed into idle duty. Because the plain work of organizing materials is the main thing.But I can\u2019t help it. Because this is the policy that Uffi and I decided after consulting each other. In the first place, the materials kept by the Ministry of Magic contain large quantities of abstract representations and contents, and trying to obtain information based on the facts is not helpful.That\u2019s why you pushed the Ministry of the Spirit to compile the material as a job, with the implication that it would look at reality. Because they wanted us to learn their intentions as to why the materials would be required by creating the materials we seek themselves.In terms of preserving culture, I do not believe that all of that material is a mistake. But I think it should be divided by purpose. That\u2019s why you wanted the Ministry of the Spirit to take charge of the cultural aspects of the country with the preservation of materials and culture and the experience gained in that role.So if you think calmly, it would be a good opportunity to publicize the work of the Spirit Ministry to do a lot of my birthday. He wants to appeal to the Royal Family that their relationship is good by showing them how much they have improved with me.I get it. You get it, don\u2019t you? But to snort honestly, the cause of me and the Spirit Ministry is not shallow. I really realize that thought gets on my face.\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you\u2026. Take it on, you\u2019ll snort. In fact, there are various advantages. But there\u2019s no reason to ignore your feelings.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything else when they bring up your birthday story. The rest of you are guilty of the same crime.\u201d\u201cNo, but you have no reason to say no. It\u2019s all good. Besides, you don\u2019t think that Miguel\u2019s in the middle of a negotiation, do you?To the father on the top of the Buddha I return with a sigh. I mean the same crime, but I don\u2019t think Father did anything wrong. Now that magic has become acceptable, public opinion is just repeating itself, and I think Father\u2019s response was right at the time.That\u2019s why it\u2019s so effective to celebrate my birthday\u2026. I can think about that. Nodding is going to be kind of heavy around the stomach.\u201cThe Spirit Ministry purely wants to hustle and bust a new role. Express the improvement of the relationship by doing much of His Royal Highness Sister Wang\u2019s Birthday Festival, which I have been scorning for as its subject. And in the future, I want to regain my voice, which has been shredded by taking the lead in the event. That\u2019s the place.\u201d\u201cSo far, the Ministry of Magic and Science has taken the subject and the name. Regardless of what you have to do, I don\u2019t mean for the Spirit Ministry to be considered idle like this. \u2026 positively\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201cAnis\u2026\u2026\u201dWith his teeth squeaking critically, he grins convulsively. I put my hand on my forehead and sighed like Ufi had stunned me, like I\u2019d managed to admit it.\u2018Cause you don\u2019t have specifications, and if you can reason and convince your emotions, you won\u2019t have a hard time. Damn, that\u2019s a hell of a story rolling in.\u201cWho told you that in the first place?Oh, it\u2019s Lang.\u201cHuh!?\u201dLang, that lang? I had no choice but to open my eyes and marvel at a name I never thought I would.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89: 89At the end of the day, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing I could do about my birthday without talking to the person who made the proposal. I have confidence that there\u2019s nothing more to lose for us than Miguel taking on an intermediary.And we wanted to invite Lang to a meeting later. Coming from the Ministry of the Spirit are Lang and two young men who are still young, whether they are Lang\u2019s secretaries.These are me and Yuffi. Father said that while Yuffi was out of the discussion, he would fill in the work that could be packed, so the discussion was to be held between the four of us.\u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty, I am truly honored to have this opportunity.\u201dLang gives a token of sophistication. The secretary who sat next to him trying to delay a beat also bowed his head.\u201cLang, no one else has called you. We would like to consider positively the Birthday Festival of Annis proposed by you, even for me.\u201d\u201cHa, thank you\u201dIf Uffi cuts out the subject, Lang closes his eyes once and then bows his head. The youth of the secretary next door remains frightened and cannot be seen calm.I hear that since moving from the Ministry of Magic to the Ministry of the Spirit, a younger generation has been employed for the main superficial role. You think the nobility, who was originally at the forefront of the Ministry of Magic, began to refrain behind him as a counsellor?I didn\u2019t have to feel any intention there, but I didn\u2019t intend to go deeper, so I heard about the rumors. I wonder if that will be an auspicious omen or a vicious omen from now on.\u201cBut there\u2019s one thing that bothers me. I hear this project is Lang, the one you set up on your initiative\u2026\u2026 isn\u2019t Annis\u2019 heart certificate at the Spirit Ministry good? Originally, you were formerly part of the Ministry of Magic. If you think about the cause at the time, are there many people who have something in mind?\u201cEspecially what you say. Regardless, I cannot say that everyone in our spiritual ministry agrees. However, I consider it imperative to improve relations between Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere and the Ministry of the Spirit. It\u2019s up to me to turn my attention to Birthday.\u201d\u201cWhy did you think that? Annis is now withdrawing from politics for a quiet rest. In the future, even if Anis is involved in politics, it is expected to be a policy of spreading magic around the Ministry of Magic. But do we need to keep the connection between the two that even the waves are going to make?Yuffi narrowed his thin eyes and asked Lang. You\u2019re getting a lot of pressure from your eyes, Yufi. Look, the secretary next to Lang. What a blue face.No, so is Lang, who\u2019s flat out. I used to be blind to the kind of ridicule that looked down on me, but now I don\u2019t feel those ills. It just haunts a pale, smug atmosphere. I\u2019m just a little surprised by the change. I don\u2019t have that lang.\u201c\u2026 right. Is it also bad to perform a far-fetched ventriloquist in front of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere? Then I would like you to judge my will and my thoughts to Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the King.\u201d\u201cThe ruling. I\u2019ll tell you what, Lang.\u201d\u201cSo take it as an indication that I have a sense of crisis about the status quo.\u201d\u201cA sense of crisis, is it? Is that about an organization called the Ministry of the Spirit?\u201cI can say that, but I also hope that you will feel this sense of crisis more widely\u201dLang said with a grand stretch of his spine as he turned straight back to Yufi and me.It doesn\u2019t feel like a crisis\u2026? Lang feels a sense of crisis directed to a wider range, including an organization called the Ministry of the Spirit? And he wants me to feel more about it. But I can\u2019t really see the sense of crisis.That was as if Uffi was the same, frowning and trying to read Lang\u2019s intentions.\u201cLang, you can be frank with me. What do you think the crisis is pointing to?\u201cYes, it is a concern for the future impact of our country\u2019s current political policy\u201d\u201c\u2026 concern about future impact? You think there\u2019s a problem with my governance?\u201cNo, Her Majesty Queen Uphilia\u2019s political skill has achieved more than was expected. The support of the people just goes up, and everyone welcomes a new king named you\u2026. but that\u2019s right. If it\u2019s a word, it\u2019s a concern because it\u2019s going too well.\u201dZero words as Lang exhaled softly, worried. Yufi looks at her face with an increasingly difficult look.Hmm? Lang doesn\u2019t have a problem with Uffi\u2019s governance, he recognizes it\u2019s more of a welcome thing, right? But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s why there\u2019s a problem?That doesn\u2019t have an impact now, but it could make a huge impact in the future. Lang is afraid of it, so he wants to improve my relationship with the Spirit Ministry. He said he had proposed planning a birthday for it.\u201cLang, what are you afraid of? Yufi\u2019s governance is stable in your eyes, isn\u2019t it? What are you looking at up ahead?\u201cHer Royal Highness Sister Wang, one agenda was raised in our spiritual ministry the other day. That was on the agenda from a meeting with Her Majesty Queen Uphilia.\u201d\u201cYufi did? To the ministry of spirits?\u201cYes, it\u2019s about stockpiling spiritual stones and how they will be treated in the future\u201dTo Lang\u2019s words I look to Yufi to take confirmation. Yufi made him nod so that there was no mistake.It is certainly within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Spirit when it comes to stockpiling spiritual stones stored in the Royal Castle. Originally, it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic.I thought the Ministry of Magic also needed to allocate personnel from the Ministry of Magic because it needed to deal with spiritual stones, but the Ministry of Passenger Magic, which I know, is a fire train now. There were too many people to do that.So if I had managed it originally, I would have settled in talking about keeping it under the control of the Spirit Ministry.\u201cThe Kingdom of Palletia is now in a period of transformation in the way the country is, due to the spread of magic. For this reason, I feel that Her Majesty the Queen is haunting her head in an attempt to twist the spiritual stones that are the driving force behind the spread. But I have some concerns about this flow.\u201d\u201cThat would lead to future impact?\u201cYes\u2026. I am concerned that spiritual stones will continue to be used\u201c only \u201dfor the spread of magic\u201dAt the same time I was satisfied with Lang\u2019s words, which I told him as if I had made up my mind, I looked up to him as much as I could. Oh, as good as it gets. Is that so? I accidentally put my hand on my forehead and exhaled deeply.Then Yufi turns her gaze worried about how I am.\u201c\u2026 anise?\u201cNo, yeah. It\u2019s ok\u2026. well. That\u2019s the kind of crisis. Not as good as it gets.\u201d\u201c\u2026 could Anis have read Lang\u2019s intentions? I can\u2019t read one thing right now, why it does and what makes me anxious\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. It could be difficult for Uffi. No, it could be harder from now on. I know Lang is in a hurry, and I think I\u2019ve figured out why the Spirit Ministry wants to take the lead in the big way of my birthday, even after some time has passed\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?Uffi looks at me and asks, bewildered. Lang also looks at me with his gaze shifted from Ufi.I exhaled to regain my mind, then tried to keep my back on my back and just broke my posture a little bit.\u201cNow magic has become a major policy that everyone, civilian or noble, will pay attention to. Everyone wants to see the convenience of a magic artifact, an invention of magic. But Lang\u2019s sense of crisis in the future\u2026 is the decline of the Spirit Faith, isn\u2019t it?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cIs it the decline of faith? No, that\u2019s\u2026 Isn\u2019t that strange?Yufi frowned to say that she could not understand. Yeah, maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for Uffi to understand. I wouldn\u2019t have been aware of it if it wasn\u2019t for the current situation.\u201cUffi thinks respect and faith in the Spirit won\u2019t waver because he deals with spiritual stones even in demonic props, right?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s right and wrong at the same time.\u201d\u201cRight, but wrong?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIt could be magic, or it could be replaced by faith in magic props. Faith in the Spirit is no different. But the contents are going to be different.\u201dAppreciation and faith in the Spirit does not change Dayuan even when demonic props are popularized. But that definitely changes shape dramatically from traditional spiritual beliefs.Yes, well, nobody understands Lang\u2019s sense of crisis because there is no change in faith in the Spirit. What Lang feels is not exactly the content of the faith itself.\u201cThe crisis Lang\u2019s having is a loss of culture, right?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201d\u201cEven if the essence of the Spirit faith remains the same, the convenience of the magic props is vividly reflected. That\u2019s why everyone asks for magic props. So much so that you might forget what it was used for.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ah\u201dSo Yufi also zeroed his breath to say that he noticed.I think people\u2019s lives are going to change dramatically with magic tools now. That\u2019s what we have to do. People want it to be more convenient as long as they know it\u2019s convenient.So if there\u2019s a better way than usual, there\u2019s no choice. But in Lang\u2019s position, given the history of the establishment of the Spirit Ministry, I\u2019m in a position to give a warning.\u201cUntil now, spiritual stones have been used for festivals, haven\u2019t they? But it was treated as a means of showing performances and daily faith on the stage: festivals. But Uffi tried to use the Spirit Stone as a magic prop to spread magic. That\u2019s good. There is no problem. But in the future, then? What if the use of spiritual stones is restricted only to demonic props?\u201c\u2026 is that what Annis calls a loss of culture. I also finally understand that Lang, who works for the Ministry of the Spirit, cannot overlook it.\u201dI don\u2019t think a bad culture can help you disappear. But I think it\u2019s a good culture to leave behind performances that use spiritual stones as festivals, because they also include a liturgical meaning.\u201cI mean, that I\u2019m too inclined to spread magic to be aware of traditional cultural preservation. Is that what you\u2019re trying to say? Lang.\u201d\u201cIt is up to Her Majesty the Queen to understand this sense of crisis,\u201d he said.\u201cI am ashamed to admit, from that point of view, that I did not take enough account of you, the Ministry of the Spirit\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, Lang. This is where I reflect, too.\u201dYufi may indeed be competent as Her Majesty the Queen, but I forgot that there are neglects in the minds of these fine people.My father, who is an assistant, has also been preaching magic to me for a long time, so he is willing to spread his magic props. Originally, it seems that his father and his predecessor, the Ministry of Spirituality, had been drinking boiled water.So again, the problem is that no one to point out was around Uffi. This is how Lang pointed me out, so I guess I can say it\u2019s a visible issue.\u201cBut Lang. You know that, right?\u201c\u2026 Yes\u201dLang nods small and makes it look like he understands what I\u2019m trying to say.I know what Lang is trying to say. This is especially true. It\u2019s not weird as Lang\u2019s job because we\u2019re the ones who have the ability to inherit and preserve culture. But\u2026\u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t think we can use spiritual stones in the traditional way when it comes to festivals. Whatever I say, but that\u2019s all the magic props had too much influence. Even Uffi might have thought, right? I wonder if the use of festive spiritual stones is a waste of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s right\u201dThe amount of spiritual stones used in the festival also varies depending on the scale of the festival. But the use of spiritual stones used at festivals is basically limited on the spot. There are definitely people out there who think that would be useless with the advent of demonic props. \u2018Cause I was the first to think.But that\u2019s because I\u2019m only looking at the convenience of demonic props. As good as using a spiritual stone in an on-the-spot festival, it is decided that it is better to use it permanently as a magic tool to help the people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s what I originally thought, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201cBut that\u2019s no good then. Whatever the future holds, if you do it now, you have no place in the ministry of spirits. But even me and the spiritual ministry have a cause, and many people think we\u2019re halfway apart. That weakens the position of the Spirit Ministry. If we cut the power of the Ministry of the Spirit, all the work we have taken over from the Ministry of Magic and the prospects for the future will be crushed.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t taste good. What is unsavory could make even people who compile materials stored in large quantities in that spiritual ministry unwanted.There is no doubt that in the future there will be more talent for the Ministry of Magic that is now becoming popular. I also recommend it in national politics. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can scorn the spiritual ministry.\u201cEven though many in the Spirit Ministry have atrophied to Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the King. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever done, but I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\u201cSo I want to improve my relationship with you, and if I can, I want to hustle and tell you that the Spirit Ministry also has a gorgeous active place after we authorize it. I want to show you a lot in the form of my birthday, which also coincides with that role of preserving culture. Is that what Lang thinks fit?\u201cYes, Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere is right.\u201dLang nodded to me to agree. But that\u2019s why the traditional way of doing it can also lead to opposition to the spiritual ministry. It was approved by me and Yuffi.Because there are things that we can\u2019t suppress because we\u2019ve already spread magic props. Even though it\u2019s a royal birthday, I can\u2019t even look at it anymore if they think it is.\u201cUntil that means, I don\u2019t have an alternative either. But rather than losing the opportunity, I wanted to tell Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the King that I was submitting this project.\u201d\u201cHmmm, that certainly feels better than not saying anything to me than it helped me to say\u2026\u201dWell, what\u2019s wrong with all this\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90: 90\u201cFirst, shall we sort out the problem\u201dYufi and Lang on my cut out, and Lang\u2019s secretary nodding like he was late and panicked.\u201cThe first thing that will be the controversy over this issue is the stock of spiritual stones and their future fate. The popularity of magic has been recognized, and in the future the magic props will be widely crossed among the people. Spirit Stone will be needed to develop this magic prop. This is what is causing the price of spiritual stones to soar. Right? Yufi.\u201d\u201cYes, the mining of spiritual stones itself is expected to be more active than in previous years. But still, it seems that it is not enough to spread the propaganda of magic props.\u201dUffi nods at my confirmation. The magic props created for me that couldn\u2019t be used can also be used by civilians who can\u2019t use magic. And with demonic props, the standard of living will definitely go up.It is because everyone understands that that that is why I hope that the development of demonic props will proceed. If it makes our lives easier, it\u2019s the natural flow that makes us want it.\u201cBut Lang wants to put the wait on this. There is no disagreement if Uffi, the queen, wants the propagation of the magic props to proceed. But if they take spiritual stones with them for all the development of magic props, this time the preservation and inheritance of culture, which is one of the responsibilities of the spiritual ministry, could become obsolete\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf I take this opportunity away, the spiritual ministry will be in disarray with Uffi, the queen, or my relationship with Uffi, who is being cordial. The wind direction towards the spiritual ministry becomes unnecessarily poor because of it. When this happens, in the future, the organization called the Ministry of the Spirit will become thinner, and then the work of the Ministry of the Spirit will have to be reduced as well. This is Lang\u2019s sense of crisis, isn\u2019t it?You\u2019re absolutely right.The problem with Dayuan is the problem surrounding the stock of spiritual stones. Uffi wants to advance the propagation of magic tools in order to improve the lives of his people, but if he dumps all of that, he could be questioned about the survival of the Langs, the Spirit Ministry.For example, if demonic props continue to take precedence, questions arise about the use of out-of-use spiritual stones at festivals and the like, which were traditional ways of utilizing spiritual stones. As a result, that could lead to a rebellion against the spiritual ministry.Even though they have a connection to the time of the Ministry of Magic. It would be their real intention not to rub it any further with me. But if I didn\u2019t do anything, I\u2019d just keep waiting for the decline. That\u2019s why Lang had to raise his voice, he said.\u201cBut that is why the use of conventional spiritual stones is not allowed. You use it pretty flashy, are you?\u201d\u201cYes, especially this planned birthday of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. I think about the years that I have never been able to celebrate, and I want to do a lot of it.\u201d\u201cIf so, it\u2019s important to look good, but can mass consumption of spiritual stones buy objection? But that\u2019s why if you get out of your hands, they might end up wanting to improve the relationship just in shape and hey\u2026\u201dI sighed as I poked my cheek wand at my knees. This is harder than I thought, isn\u2019t it?But if you hadn\u2019t told me, the Spirit Ministry might have weakened us so much that we didn\u2019t want to, and I have to thank Lang for all this advice. I brought this story after I said that Lang doesn\u2019t have an alternative either, so I guess I\u2019m ready.Stimulating me must be terrible for the spiritual ministry, even if there is a visible and discerning decline. Queen\u2019s reign of Uffi, and division and independence between the Ministry of Spirituality and the Ministry of Magic, HR renewal in doing so. Yeah, this isn\u2019t about being hard to move! I can\u2019t move badly!\u201cSo, what are we gonna do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult problem\u2026\u201dUffi is also grumbling troubledly with his hands on his chin. This is not something that can be solved in half, is it?\u201cI knew you wanted to make it to my birthday this year?\u201cIf possible. The more time we put aside, the more atrophic we may remain, and even if we make an opinion like this, we may not be able to move.\u201d\u201cYou mean quite Setouchi\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you are idle, if you do not have to inspire His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere, many compromised.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re terrified of me for a long time, me\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how horrible you are. To be precise, what I\u2019ve done to you. So if it\u2019s retaliation, there are nights when you can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question to say that you deserve it\u2026\u201dAt least at a time when I was neglected, because that\u2019s the right idea. It\u2019s common sense that I\u2019ve been pulling back and forth now. People and things are never certain in value. Because the balance is biased against me now.Then it would be better for me and the Spirit Ministry to make up just now, but there is also a risk that if we reconcile poorly, the position of the Spirit Ministry will become more subtle. Then I would ask the Ministry of Spirituality to work hard, but the problem is that there is no good idea in which direction to work hard.\u201cI want to take the lead in the festival called My Birthday to improve my relationship with me and yet impress upon the glorious work of the Spirit Ministry. But a spiritual stone is required in the conventional way. I can buy strange objections now. But I don\u2019t even have the option of not doing it. Is it okay that you\u2019re crying to us because you\u2019re in trouble?\u201c\u2026 it would be inevitable if they took it that way\u201dLang nodded with a grin to mock himself. He\u2019s in a difficult position, too, I realized again. I\u2019ve had a little conversation before, but I feel that Lang and I changed again.Now, what we need to discuss is how to solve this problem. I want to celebrate my birthday if I can, and I want it to be a step in the glorious activity of the Spirit Ministry. But the spiritual ministry is troubled by festive methods that have gone out of the traditional way. I want to proceed more carefully than there is national sentiment involved here.That\u2019s why I mounted this place through Miguel. To share this concern. And think about what I can do.\u201cThe Birthday Flow is a parade and a presentation to the people. In large part, these two things.\u201d\u201cThese are the two, if you include a festival of congratulations at the show.\u201d\u201cYou think the parade for the people is good because it reduces the flow a little when Yuffi\u2019s queen reigns, or adds an arrangement just like the basics do. So if you\u2019re going to make a difference, you\u2019re going to be at the show.\u201dIt\u2019s the show that\u2019s the problem. If the parade is for civilians, the presentation is for nobility. It\u2019s one of the main opportunities to let the nobles know what the royal family wants at the same time.That\u2019s why I can\u2019t do bad things. But if you make it smaller, it doesn\u2019t make sense that it hasn\u2019t improved with me in the end. I need some kind of eye-catching impact.But I don\u2019t know what to say, but there are a lot of people in the Spirit Ministry with old ideas. And those who can\u2019t change from there. I guess that\u2019s why the former upper management was lined up and pushed backwards: the advisor.Anyway, the corner lang came to negotiate. I want this to be a big step and I want it to be a success, too. It\u2019s my birthday! That makes me feel odd, but it\u2019s a national festival that I have to do.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, the traditional way, is that spiritual stones are consumed in large quantities.\u201d\u201cYep. But it is also an indication of royal authority. Even though the current policy direction is geared towards demonic props, it can be a gap to reduce the number of spiritual stones below the prescribed number than we lead.\u201d\u201cUgh, it\u2019s a symbol of authority to mass spiritual stones in the first place, or as a sign of spiritual blessings, right?Turning his gaze to Lang to make sure, a secretary-like youth sitting next to him looking at me as if he were surprised. Making his eyes look right at that gaze, the young man missed his gaze as he panicked.\u201cAnd excuse me!\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing good\u2026 did I say something weird?\u201c\u2026 that, Her Royal Highness Sister Wang had heard of no interest in spiritual faith or royal duties, and it was rudely unexpected that opinions would be uttered as such\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 uh. That\u2019s right, Lang. I\u2019d like to make sure of one thing.\u201d\u201cBefore that. I beg your pardon. Sorry, sir.\u201d\u201cAlso, I\u2019m sorry!Let Lang grab the head of the young man next to him, who frowned slightly, and lower it. The youth also bowed their heads so that they could be lowered to Lang as they panicked.\u201cFine, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disrespectful. That\u2019s what I want to hear. Hey, maybe I hate spiritual faith, or they think I\u2019m indifferent?\u201c\u2026 With all due respect, I don\u2019t know what else to do if they take it that way\u201d\u201cYeah. No, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say misunderstanding\u2026 I\u2019m not neglecting the Spirit Faith. Though not enthusiastic, I intend to share my respect for the Spirit.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be proposing the establishment of a ministry of spirits. I don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d\u201cHaha, thanks. Then I knew I wanted my birthday to be at the initiative of the Spirit Ministry. It\u2019s better if you prove that I\u2019m a believer in the Spirit Faith as well as improving my relationship with me. It\u2019s not irrelevant my disbelief that people in the Spirit Ministry are more frightened than they need to be, is it?Neither Lang nor Lang\u2019s secretary\u2019s youth had an answer, but that was the answer.I didn\u2019t see any spirits. I don\u2019t know. I admit that I never thought deeply about believing it, even though I knew it.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But Yufi became a spiritual contractor, and I also met Lhumi. The spirits that materialized could also be seen. Its existence is closer than before. That\u2019s why I think we can offer more prayers than before. Experiences are important!\u201cLet\u2019s get back to it, but the use of spiritual stones can be a problem anyway, so as to make the festival a big deal. There\u2019s no reason not to use it at all, but I\u2019m bad at using it the traditional way. It\u2019s also a problem to reduce it. That\u2019s a troubling story.\u201d\u201c\u2026 we were both the most troubled species there. So His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat would you do?What would you do if I were you? I close my eyes to Lang\u2019s inquiry, and then close my eyes to my thoughts.Diving just a little into my own thoughts, the answer came right out. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing to put that in your mouth. But I have to put it in my mouth. I have to move on. I look straight back at Lang.\u201cIf I were you \u2013 I\u2019d use magic props\u201dThe field air dropped to cool down. Uffi glanced at me and Lang\u2019s secretary glanced at Lang as she peered.Yes, if I were you, I\u2019d make demon props for the festival. But that\u2019s the future Lang wanted to avoid. Because I wanted to inherit and preserve the traditional culture. It\u2019s a guy named Main Fall.\u201c\u2026 you know what I mean. Still, is that the answer?\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201cThe future, because we can inherit the past. So if I were you, I\u2019d sharpen what I don\u2019t need based on traditional methods, leaving only the good ones\u201dIn this case, the culture of festivals, which consume large quantities of spiritual stones, is cut off as unnecessary. And a good thing is a form of blessing, or its thoughts and wishes.If I were you, I would be able to thank the Spirit by using it as a magic prop. Because I\u2019ve come this far because I\u2019m a demonic prop created in the process with the results of learning and discussing magic.\u201cThere is no future in the past. But I can think of the past as this moment, and I think I can take this thought to the future. But I can\u2019t do all of that. Because the world is changing. There\u2019s definitely something I can\u2019t stay that way. Still, take what you shouldn\u2019t lose in it. I think that\u2019s why we can change.\u201d\u201c\u2026 when the old faith breathes in its new faith\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. So now, Lang says we should preserve what he calls culture. But if one day it\u2019s going to change, I also think that\u2019s people\u2019s answer. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to change while we\u2019re alive, or if anyone else will.\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea if I don\u2019t change. So if it\u2019s for nothing, I want to change it, and I hope so. But I can\u2019t even say that my correctness is the only correctness in the world.So Lang and the others, who say there\u2019s something they don\u2019t want to change, acknowledged the existence of the Spirit Ministry. I want to take their wishes and thoughts. On top of that, I want to decide how it will change. Will it change because it doesn\u2019t change, or because it doesn\u2019t want it to change?\u201cMy dreams are no longer mine alone. So I will\u201dCorrect your posture, stretch your spine and I go on\u2026. and Uffi\u2019s hand was layered on my lap. If he turned his gaze toward Lang toward Uffi, Uffi looked at me as if he were seeing the loving.To the heat of that gaze, the heat on his face seemed to rise at once. I unwittingly waved and turned away. Then I heard Yufi giggling from behind. This one, this one\u2026!\u201c\u2026 hon.\u201dLang coughed deliberately to get the air back on the field. I posture back like a spring trick. The fever on my cheeks stays the same!\u201c\u2026 the words of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere, echoed in this breast\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHer Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. Would you mind giving us a course in magic?\u201c\u2026 eh!? That goes to the Spirit Ministry!?\u201d\u201cNothing says all personnel in the Spirit Ministry. I\u2019ll be responsible for choosing who I teach.\u201dI was surprised at Lang\u2019s offer. Even Uffi stares at Lang in surprise.\u201cTo clarify, His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere\u2019s previous inventions of magic props can be seen as all that is valued for practicality\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. Right. It\u2019s a prerequisite to use it.\u201d\u201cAnd as I see it, I use it for rituals\u2026 and in other words, there is no magic object for rituals.\u201dI can\u2019t deny that. Because my magic props were kept in mind to recreate and use magic. Still, I don\u2019t get it when people say it\u2019s a magic item that can be used for rituals.\u201c\u2026 So Lang wants to devise and create a magic prop for it?\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, but we can\u2019t keep missing the opportunity like this. I listened to your words and hardened my heart. For once, I\u2019d like you to teach me magic.\u201dSeeing Lang bow his head deeply, I had to stare at the heavenly edge of his head.What are you going to do, this situation?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: 91A few days after my meeting with Lang, I decided to swallow Lang\u2019s request after worrying about it. In other words, I am determined to give a course in magic to the face of the Spirit Ministry.I guess the reason I couldn\u2019t snort right away was because I hadn\u2019t been able to liquidate my previous relationship myself. But then I knew I wouldn\u2019t move on.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m supposed to do, I\u2019m sure.\u201dI think that\u2019s what I should do when I\u2019ve created magic in the world and given it a cut of change.I reached the Ministry of the Spirit within the context of renewing such thoughts. A standing unchanged since the time of the Ministry of Magic. Is it the liveliness of people and the signs that put it up that have changed?That\u2019s also due to the changes I urged. Slap him on the cheek as you have decided, then step into the entrance.\u201cI have been waiting for you, Your Royal Highness the King of Anisphere\u201d\u201cGood day, Lang\u201dLang was there so that he could wait when he entered the entrance. Speaking out to Lang, who greets him with a thank you, Lang leads me into one room, not saying he doesn\u2019t need to talk in vain.That was similar to the lecture room at the school where I said in my previous life. At the bottom are faculty desks and blackboards on the back, and each desk and chair arranged in bowl-shaped steps. There were already facades of the Ministry of the Spirit so that they could wait.They who were sitting confirmed that I had entered the room and immediately rose up to give a deep thank you. I\u2019m a little scared of the undisturbed movement and realize it.\u201cThey are the people who make my thoughts the same as mine and take the lead on this plan. Compared to those who have been pulled out by the Ministry of Magic and Science, we are still unable to determine our attitude towards magic, but I hope that His Royal Highness Sister Wang will behave freely because there is nothing to deny.\u201d\u201cThank you very much\u2026\u201dI\u2019m a little unfamiliar with Lang being awed without disgust. Until a while ago, he was a disgusting, disgusting guy.While I\u2019m thinking about it, Lang moves to the blank seat at the beginning. I also switch consciousness and go up to the lecture.\u201cGood mood, ladies and gentlemen\u2026. Oh my God, let\u2019s skip the hard greeting, it\u2019s not His Royal Highness Sister Wang who\u2019s here, he\u2019s going to be a leader in magic. At Lang\u2019s request today, I\u2019m here to give you a course in magic. Before I start the course, I\u2019d like to change the purpose of this course.\u201dSeparate words there once. No one feels a sight like evil feelings for me. Finished confirming I cough up one and then go on with the words.\u201cEven when it comes to magic, I think its major purpose is to explore. If there is a mystery, figure this out, know the law, learn and be your own. I have come to orient this attitude of magic towards my quest for magic. In the process, an invention called Demonic Props was born. I know a lot about misunderstandings and suspicions, but if you stick with magic, you\u2019ll get to the first philosophy I said.\u201dLook over everyone here again. I breathe again so that I can breathe, and I keep on saying words so that I can fold even more.\u201cThe way this magic philosophy and posture is also about asking about the way faith is. I know very well that you take this as disgraceful and disrespectful. But in my opinion the world is constantly changing. People change, the world changes. Generation change can be an example of this. Whether it is an invisible change or a visible change, the same thing does not always exist. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m expected to embrace change for something I shouldn\u2019t change. For that reason, I hope that we can make this time a time for meaningful discussion, for the sake of what we must not change with everyone again.\u201dI guess that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say. I look at the reactions of the people taking lectures there.The result, for better or worse? I know you\u2019re listening focused, but I don\u2019t like it or dislike it. I\u2019m not unresponsive, but I can\u2019t breathe. I guess the Spirit Ministry air isn\u2019t compatible with me!\u201cNow let\u2019s get to the point. This time, thanks to you, the Spirit Ministry will lead my Birthday Festival, trying to improve the relationship and at the same time hustle and bust the role of the Spirit Ministry. Uffi is happy to welcome this proposal. I take it personally, albeit with mixed feelings, favourably. But I think everyone understands that we can\u2019t do it at a traditional festival.\u201d\u201c\u2026 may I make a statement? Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere.\u201dSpeaking with his hands up was a man who would be an elderly man among the faces gathered here. I guess he\u2019s only just in his thirties. The man comes to me with a straight gaze.I take a challenging, straight gaze at you, too. You shouldn\u2019t be cowering here.\u201cAllow me to speak. What is it?\u201cTo confirm, Her Majesty still wants to operate the Spirit Stone intensively in the development of the Demonic Prop. May I assume that you set your mind as such?\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t say no to that. But Yuffi doesn\u2019t want the Spirit Ministry to become a poor minister.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why Lang tells me it would be a good idea to invent magic props for festivals. But\u2026\u2026 we, who have a poor understanding of magic, understand that magic props are things that make people who cannot use magic as magic also operate pseudo. How do you suppose it\u2019s for a festival?I guess that\u2019s a question everyone in the place here has. My gaze is once again focused on me, waiting for that answer.I honestly thought that question might come. So I was able to respond immediately without staring.\u201cYeah. Especially that question. So what we offer to the Ministry of the Spirit is neither the magic props themselves, nor the inventions proposed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 and say?\u201cThere is only one thing I have decided that I should lecture the Spirit Ministry. It is true that we will eventually create the same method as the magic props, but I think that the method itself can break this case. That\u2019s how spiritual stones are processed\u201d\u201cProcessing method, is it?\u201cOnly spiritual stones required for festivals are consumed in large quantities to symbolize authority and to give thanks to the Spirit. But every time a spiritual stone is consumed, it affects the manufacture of magic props. So I\u2019m going to make a piece of history, and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. Who\u2019s going to inherit that in the spiritual ministry?Lang told me to use the magic prop for the ritual, and I thought about it until I gave my lecture today. An important part of the spiritual faith is to show authority and the place of faith on the basis. Until now, I have measured it with the amount of spiritual stone used. I think I can say.But the only problem with that is that if I did that every time, my consumption would just keep increasing. So what about creating a point commensurate with a single huge consumption and inheriting this? That.\u201cSo I said ritual magic props, not made for the purpose of using clear magic, but a symbol of a single thing I created using the means of creating the magic props I found. Even if I think of this as an initial investment, I thought that I might be able to curb future consumption of spiritual stones\u2026\u201dWhat do you say? I peek around and see the reaction, but\u2026 unresponsive.\u2026 Hey Lang! What\u2019s unresponsive to you! My stomach\u2019s gonna hurt!\u201cBut the problem is, I don\u2019t have anything that comes to mind as a symbol of authority in its history for a long time, and I\u2019d like to ask everyone for that proposal\u2026\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m unresponsive. Hey, I think I\u2019m about to cry?Then Lang hit his hand once. Everyone turns their gaze to Lang.\u201cThank you, Sister King Anisphere, for an interesting lecture. From here, it will be time to bring your own ideas and further refine them. Can I think of something like that?\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. Well\u2026 I didn\u2019t abandon the Spirit Faith, but I\u2019m not sure when people ask me if I\u2019m faithful. Is that why we should all come up with an actual plan?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cAs far as it goes. If so, it was also something that had a slight impact on us. For once, I think we should take a break and then move on to the next agenda, what do you say?\u201c\u2026 it would be helpful if you could do that\u201dJust a little bit of air in the boulder. Even the people in the Spirit Ministry may be desperate to swallow, but I can\u2019t help but worry about some kind of unresponsiveness that\u2019s immersed in me.Nodding at Lang\u2019s suggestion, Lang led me to a separate room to escort me. There you are a samurai serving in the ministry of spirits, who had already finished preparing tea. A samurai walks away with a quiet bowl of grace.Me and Lang are the only ones left. The door to the room is open, and there are signs of people, so it\u2019s not just the two of us. I\u2019m so restless. Grab a cup of tea so you can get back on your mind.\u201c\u2026 you know. Lang.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Your Royal Highness?\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s lecture, I wonder how it went. I didn\u2019t hear from everyone and I didn\u2019t know how to respond\u2026\u201d\u201cMind if I say something frank?\u201c\u2026 please\u201dUh, yeah. I guess it wasn\u2019t very good when Lang was going to preface it like this. It makes me squishy by accident.But I can\u2019t even change the direction without asking, so I have to ask.\u201cI understand. But it\u2019s still difficult to empathize. It\u2019s not about reason, it\u2019s about emotion.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what does that mean?\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something first, I\u2019m not talking about the unacceptability of Her Royal Highness the King. This must be my own problem.\u201d\u201cMy own?\u201cI received the Kaoru pottery of magic, and once again I felt\u2026 that it was something different from people and not like spirits\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah?Uh, I mean, what do you mean? I can\u2019t really grasp what Lang is trying to say, and I stare at his face.\u201cUntil now the Spirit Faith has come to lean on the Spirit, and it has come as a good. I mean\u2026 the only thing that didn\u2019t change was that we thought it was something we should protect. Because the Spirit doesn\u2019t change. If you lean on the Spirit, won\u2019t you ever ask for a change?\u201c\u2026 on reason, I wonder if so\u201d\u201cKing\u2019s power, noble authority, faith in the Spirit. He said the mission was to inherit it it without changing its shape. Drill for it and put something better up there. That\u2019s at least what I was thinking. But that\u2019s how I felt it wasn\u2019t right for people in that way of life. Because, as you say, the world and people cannot remain the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah. Still, the Spirit does not change the nature of nature. What you see on the surface changes, but the Spirit doesn\u2019t. So in any way, the Spirit will continue to be our friend. It helps me. Magic or magic props.\u201dI don\u2019t like theology, and to be honest, it doesn\u2019t suit my skin. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why it\u2019s at odds with magic. Of course, there are places where the opposite doesn\u2019t match, and I don\u2019t even think that magic and theology that reveal mystery are the same ideas.But that\u2019s on people\u2019s own. No matter how controversial, the Spirit remains the same. Because the nature of them, which is considered the embodiment of nature, does not change when the world or people change.\u201cReason tells me. But I guess it will only take a little while for me to do the same thing for the better. Until I chew through this indescribable emotion.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but you still lean on magic.\u201d\u201cIf that is the decision of the king upon whom we stand.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll thank Yufi.\u201dI don\u2019t think my distance from Lang has diminished either. But I felt like I could talk to nature more than before.I\u2019m not gonna tell you how happy I am with that minor change. With that in mind I put my mouth on the tea again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: 92At the end of my break with Lang, when I went back to my room, I saw people from the Spirit Ministry face-to-face discussing it. Earlier, I heard my lecture pale. I hit them and they change and exchange words hot.As I rounded my eyes to the unexpected sight, I noticed Lang entering first and everyone corrected their residence and took their seats. It\u2019s quiet, like when I was giving a lecture, to show no pale emotions.\u201c\u2026 uh. You don\u2019t have to worry about me\u2026?\u201cNo, for that reason\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Royal Highness the King of Anisphere says. There\u2019s no need to be so hard. You understand me saying this is more like it than the ex. Sometimes it\u2019s disrespectful.\u201dThe people of the Spirit Ministry looked complicated in Lang\u2019s words. The hell, he seemed confused as to how to react.I don\u2019t know what to do with my attitude towards me, because it\u2019s also because of my stack so far. I can\u2019t decide what to do myself.It doesn\u2019t change that I am royal when I say that Uffi has reigned over me as queen. I don\u2019t think you have to behave as you should, yeah. Right.\u201cThen I want you to do this. I want you to treat me as a single researcher when I\u2019m talking about magic. I want you to treat me as my sister Wang if it\u2019s not a place where magic is not involved or a private place. This is the compromise I can show. Because if you seem to care about your identity and can\u2019t even give an opinion, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have me in a place for discussion like this. I want you to obey me as a royal word if you have to.\u201dIt\u2019s not a good idea not to behave as a royal. But when I\u2019m talking about magic, I\u2019m more of a researcher than a royal. That\u2019s why I want you to change the way you treat me according to this situation.With my clear guidance, the people of the Spirit Ministry finally seemed to ease their attitudes just a little bit. I stroke my chest down gently too in the air that only got a little better.\u201cSo, did you come up with any good ideas?\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u2026 I first reviewed the role of Spirit Stone in the festival and thought about what is required of a demonic prop that can be used permanently to reduce the consumption of Spirit Stone. Now I think the consumption of spiritual stones is an indication of its authority, and that consumption is what was seen as important.\u201d\u201cI was that recognition, too, wasn\u2019t I? But in today\u2019s public opinion, mass consumption of spiritual stones can buy disgust.\u201d\u201cHer Royal Highness Sister Wang is right. What kind of magic equipment would be good, then? In the first place, we thought that magic tools were being created to make the tools that already existed more convenient and exert limited magic there.\u201dYeah. My celestial is also prototyped as a sword, and I think you\u2019d be right if they told me it was a tool for using it, combining magical swords there. Try to magically make the tools you have now more convenient. That\u2019s one of the reasons demonic props are made.Sometimes air bikes and other things are created to realize previous life concepts, but that\u2019s why many of them are created in combination with existing tools.\u201cSo, is it ideal to attract people\u2019s attention at festivals, something indispensable, and magic props that can be used at the initiative of the Ministry of the Spirit?\u201cYes. That\u2019s what we thought, too. So one idea came to mind, I floated\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? Did you float?I blinked my eyes unexpectedly. I turn my gaze unintentionally on Lang, who was accompanying me on my break. He\u2019s also opening his eyes to a little surprise.\u201cIf it\u2019s a birthday like this one, it\u2019s an instrument that\u2019s especially essential\u201d\u201cInstruments?\u201d\u201cYes, from the bustle of the venue, performers are also essential when dancing. Some hymns are dedicated to the Spirit. And songs and instruments are one of the most frequently used tools of aristocracy.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly true if you ask me. There is no such concept in this world as recording music. We need performers when we dance, and an instrument is arguably the most eye-catching dish if we pay attention to it.\u201cThe performance of instruments is not one of the preferences of nobility. And as a performer it is the second son of the nobility and those who do not succeed to the title, one of the professions chosen by them. I think it would be an opportunity to show those people the day\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess it\u2019s good! Instrument! I think it\u2019s nice too!Instruments created with magic props technology! I guess that\u2019s very good! You\u2019re overflowing with dreams and romance somehow!It\u2019s just that when I show a delightful reaction, people in the spiritual ministry look at me like I\u2019m having trouble reacting, and I\u2019m like, oh? And I lean my neck.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201cNo, the\u2026 Is that really what Her Royal Highness Sister Wang thinks? It\u2019s an instrument, right?\u201cYeah? Isn\u2019t it nice because it\u2019s an instrument?\u201cHis Royal Highness the King of Anisphere develops demonic props as a help to life and a practical one. So I thought there might be no use for tailoring instruments as magic props.\u201d\u201cHuh? Doesn\u2019t it have to be anything practical?We\u2019ll be silent with each other. They look at each other with the look of birds being shot by arrows. I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s it like this mutual perception is uneven?\u201cWhat, did you need a condition called a practical festive tool?\u201c\u2026 Her Royal Highness Sister Wang does not ask for practicality in demonic props?\u201cI do make magic props as a handy thing, but this time for a different purpose, huh? Because the intent of this demonic prop is to reduce the consumption of spiritual stones, but also to use them at festivals. Well, I suppose it\u2019s okay to make an instrument as a workpiece because it has a symbolic meaning to it. Practicality may actually be used for something if I try to make it, but I think the important thing is to correctly indicate the intent given to that tool\u2026\u201dI certainly don\u2019t know what an instrument made of spiritual stone processing technology can be used for. But I think that technology and symbolism are the things that matter. Play a song that offers praise to the Spirit, an instrument created with the technique of processing spiritual stones given by the Spirit.And it is also a dedication to the blood that the royal family has inherited from the history that has made this country. Even if it\u2019s not practical, if it\u2019s made with all this intent, it\u2019s not a problem at all than just consuming spiritual stones. And once you make it, you\u2019ll have to put your hands on it to take care of it, but the consumption should be reduced.\u201c\u2026 Sister Wang, may I ask you something now?\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat do you really think of us, the Ministry of the Spirit?He has asked me that question as one man stands for. Though I accidentally saw Lang\u2019s face, Lang didn\u2019t seem to be going to say anything in silence.\u201cWhy would you want to hear that?\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you think, but I don\u2019t know what to do. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confused. You can say you\u2019re afraid.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. I guess I\u2019m the one who did that.\u201dI am the one who has done something to destroy this country\u2019s previous values. The reforms that Uffi has also accomplished by involving him are what I wanted above all else, but I take it for granted that some people hate and confuse that change.The spiritual ministry was largely cut off from power because it was necessary for the reforms I wanted. I nonetheless insisted that we should leave behind an organization called the Ministry of the Spirit, also because I have what I want.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI just want everyone in the spiritual ministry to do their best.\u201d\u201cWork hard, do you?\u201cYes, you can do things I can\u2019t. I can do things you can\u2019t do. But that\u2019s not why I want to get along. Even the problem surrounding the demand for spiritual stones this time. I want Spirit Stone to be used more for demonic props, and things to help people live more widely. But I feel guilty for doing something that would destroy the culture you\u2019ve cherished. So I wondered if I could show it in a new way, in a way that inherited something.\u201dPut your hands on your chest and I\u2019ll look for words to see how I feel.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, you didn\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t think you can forgive the former Ministry of Magic for neglecting me. But I don\u2019t think you want me to disappear because I can\u2019t forgive you. You neglected to do so. [M] So I won\u2019t either, and I shouldn\u2019t. If there is a path on which we can walk each other a little further, I want to go that way. I entrusted the Ministry of the Spirit with the compilation of past records because I thought you were the best people to inherit the history and culture of this country. No matter how the country changes, I want you to tell the future with your heart that you have this culture and it\u2019s still handed down today.\u201d\u201c\u2026 how can you think that way?\u2018Cause my dream is the Wizard who makes someone smileSomeone sounded breathtaking. My dreams, my admiration, the way I wanted to. Wizards who make someone smile, I still want to be. The wizard, though a little different from the image, is not common in this country.\u201cI want everyone to laugh. People I know, someone I don\u2019t know, want to find a way for everyone not to be unhappy. Ideal theory, but I\u2019ve always wanted to be. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to help you. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201dI uttered the words to be conveyed. What you wanted, what you wished for, why you poke and move me now.Thoughts about people in the Spirit Ministry are complicated, but I think it would be great if they could work hard, be praised and praised where they can be active. If you ask me if I can praise you directly, it\u2019s a little difficult.\u2026 So, this is where I\u2019ve been completely quiet, but what am I supposed to do with this?\u201cHer Royal Highness the King of Anisphere\u201d\u201cLang\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d had enough for today. The idea of an instrument is very interesting. I think I\u2019ll consider it on that line, so should I contact the Ministry of Magic and Sciences regarding processing techniques for spiritual stones, etc?\u201cUh, yeah. Right. I\u2019ve never touched a musical instrument, and I think I should talk to a craftsman\u2026?\u201cThank you. Thank you for your time today.\u201dLang gratefully urges me to take my hand and escort him out of the room. Um, this is polite, but do you mean go home?I did get weird air, and maybe I should just go home like this. No, I can\u2019t make a decision for a minute, so I\u2019ll give you a courtesy and leave at Lang\u2019s escort.\u201cYou\u2019re still too irritating.\u201dLeaving the room, Lang said so with a bitter smile a little walk away. I couldn\u2019t deny it either, so I think you have a subtle look on your face.\u201cYou may be rude, but I\u2019m not sure I can get along with you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind. In the first place, yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a different attitude than you. We ask you to be royal, to be the one who stands above us, the one who guides us. to its blood, to its status.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well, if they say royalty, right? I used to think it didn\u2019t matter, but now I think I should be able to act like that some more.\u201d\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s also good to want to be a wizard. Her Majesty Queen Uphilia stood as king, and I wondered if that was why.\u201dHe let go of the hand Lang was escorting and took a step away from me.\u201cWe still need time to exchange words.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201cFrom various points of view, I thought so. So I\u2019m going to make future inquiries through the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\u201cYeah. If you think Lang should do that. You\u2019re just gonna be busy over there, so don\u2019t let him be impotent, okay?\u201cIf you said that, wouldn\u2019t the people in the Ministry of Magic give you a subtle look?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m the one who kept you busy.\u201dI was wondering if I should work. But weirdly, when I move, I seem to stutter everyone like I did today. I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s talk to Uffi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: 93\u201cDo you want to work?\u201d\u201cYeah. I knew it was, like, vague, but I thought so.\u201dThe night I finished my lecture work at the Spirit Ministry, before I went to sleep, I was talking to Yufi.Get in bed and fall asleep in line. Lean over and look at each other\u2019s faces. I have a slightly tight look and Yuffi has a slightly troubled look on her face.\u201cBut I knew I\u2019d move too\u2026 if I wasn\u2019t in the right mood with everyone, it would be difficult.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right. Because Anis still has a unique sensibility.\u201dYufi answers quietly to my whine without denying it.\u201cI wanted Annis to get some rest. You\u2019ve been running forever and it seemed like you couldn\u2019t afford to look around. And I thought it would take time to understand what Annis had in mind.\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess I realized it again today. I don\u2019t know\u2026 I knew you didn\u2019t understand.\u201dSay it with your mouth, even imagine. It\u2019s hard not to wake up in real life.I have no choice but to take a small sigh. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work.\u201cThe story around my birthday ended up letting the Ministry of Magic take the trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that either. I think it would be premature for Annis to discuss the concept directly with the Spirit Ministry.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but you didn\u2019t object to this lecture, did you?\u201cThe request Lang had made had been fulfilled, and even for me, I hoped it would have been something we wanted. Even if that makes it a drama drug. It\u2019s a kind of bet.\u201dSays Yufi with a bitter smile. The colour of fatigue appeared on his face.\u201cWalking away from the Spirit Ministry is desirable. Because we don\u2019t have enough people from what to what now. It\u2019s a headache to have few people who can handle my imaginary policies.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the future, we want to go with a heavy use of people like Lang who can move actively in response to the current situation. It would be an assumption that if he were actually that vessel\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, my God\u2026 that\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cI guess politics is a nasty thing. No, it means accomplishing something in the first place.\u201dYuffi strokes my cheek to comfort me. When I\u2019m touched by Yuffi\u2019s soft fingers, I can\u2019t stand it and hug Yuffi and bury her face in her chest.With his face buried in his chest, Yufi strokes my head like a toddler.\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t rush. But I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying to myself.\u201d\u201cIs Uffi in a hurry, too?\u201cThat\u2019s, well\u2026. because your freedom is my most important wish.\u201dPomp, and Uffi\u2019s hand that strokes his head keeps his chest warm. Keep your eyes closed and I leaned over to Yuffi to sweeten him.\u201cHuh? You said you set a date for my birthday?Time has passed since I gave my lecture at the Spirit Ministry, and since then I have begun studying my work and national politics in detail as Her Royal Highness Sister Wang.From the teacher who worked as an educator again, you gradually sprouted your mind as a royalty, and I was delighted with tears, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I just laugh bitterly.When I got used to living like that, I finally got the news that my birthday day day was set. Much of the day has passed since I was born, but I can\u2019t help it all.\u201cYes, now that the day is set, you have to tailor your dress in earnest\u201d\u201cOh, already. I\u2019m alive\u2026 please don\u2019t dress like a shoulder stiff again.\u201dIlia, who gave me the report, said to me with no expression, but with a boost of vitality in her eyes. I must have a decent look on my face.Although it hasn\u2019t been as painful as it used to be to show your face to a feast or social gathering since then, wearing a dress is unwelcome because your shoulders are stiff.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This time, we\u2019re talking about tailoring that unusual dress that we usually wear for the ceremony.\u201d\u201cHuh!? Really!?\u201d\u201cMaster Uphilia has been wearing that dress a lot. They were asking me if I could take this opportunity to become fashionable. Since Anisphere was originally devised, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s natural for you to take the initiative to wear it and promote it?\u201cNo, I appreciate it as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2026 okay?\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll get you a regular dress?\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I like that. But wouldn\u2019t they say something?\u201cShouldn\u2019t I let you say it?\u201cThink of it as other HR\u2026\u201dMake a fashion. It is true that spreading demonic props may also go hand in hand with creating a fashion. Then I wonder if there\u2019s anything else wrong with trying to send out this knight\u2019s clothes one-piece dress as a fashion tailored for the ceremony\u2026?Yeah, I tried to worry about it while I roared, but the feeling of not wanting to wear a stubborn dress won me over, and I decided to participate in the proposed dress for my birthday.In fact, I asked my opinion when a familiar tailor came and checked the measurements and design, but he generally responded favourably.A familiar tailor is a middle-aged woman. For a long time as a tailor, I worked and this guy was also someone I knew when I got down to Castle Town with patience.He\u2019s the one who took on my order for a knight\u2019s clothing one-piece dress, less frequent but easier to talk to if you look at him.Sometimes she receives requests for noble dresses, so she\u2019s also bright about noble circumstances. When I talked to him about what I honestly thought of wearing this dress at my birthday, he gave me a pleasant grin.\u201cIsn\u2019t that something good? Besides, Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere is braver than femininity, or something like that, right?\u201cBravery\u2026 I just feel like I don\u2019t know anything scary or shameless\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, hey, some women might want to live on the path of the sword, like Her Royal Highness King Anisphere in the future, right?\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m not living in a sword path\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I know that. But Her Royal Highness Sister Wang would have acted as an adventurer, wouldn\u2019t she? Mixed with the Knights.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to hustle and bust as one of those uniforms in the future when a woman like that comes out? Um, was it Mana Blade? Wouldn\u2019t you say that if you had the tools, even women would have no bitterness to wave their swords? Besides, noble ladies often have swords, don\u2019t they?\u201cUh, yeah. Not everyone\u2026\u201dCertainly there are martial arts enthusiasts, and they are incorporated as classes at the College of Lords. Whether or not you just take classes is how you can make your own choices.Looks like Raini or Halfis didn\u2019t choose. Yuffi was choosing a class because of the Duke\u2019s preference. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a bunch of all-purpose Supermen like Yufi.\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental that noble women protect their homes and raise their children, isn\u2019t it? You know, dowry or son-in-law in a relationship is my job.\u201d\u201cKeeping the blood alive is a noble job.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. But it\u2019s not like anyone sticks out of that kind of common sense. Wouldn\u2019t women come out wanting to join the Knights in the future as one of those women\u2019s employments!Basically, the knight is aware of a man\u2019s work, so he\u2019s not wrong. I can\u2019t deny it, either, if it\u2019s my job to keep the blood of my house alive if I\u2019m born as a nobleman\u2019s maid.But if that\u2019s not all we can do, we can show the way. Regardless of whether that\u2019s good or bad, I thought it might indicate that the possibilities have widened.\u201cYou skip the details, and this dress is the ideal dress that looks like His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere, right? It\u2019s a birthday in the corner, so it\u2019s best for Her Royal Highness Sister Wang to behave the way she thinks!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI wonder if so\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! These days, everyone is making a scene day and night wondering what can be done with the spread of magic props! The blacksmith and the mechanic will run out of people! He was screaming delightfully.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201dIf the propaganda of magic props will enliven us all, it would be a great pleasure for me.I want not only nobles, but also civilians, to smile at the people who live in this country. Wishing a long time ago, my eyes twitched and became hot that some dream I was about to give up was taking shape.\u201cOh, and is it the extraction of His Royal Highness Sister Wang? The musicians have been making a lot of noise lately.\u201d\u201cThe musicians?Speaking of instruments, I was on the agenda at the Ministry of the Spirit and that was clear, but was the story moving properly? I heard you discussed it with the Ministry of Magic, but you were curious because you didn\u2019t even hear what it was about.Once, I asked Halfis to see it, but it\u2019s a birthday in the corner, and it\u2019s a rest period, so it\u2019s been kept a casual secret. I didn\u2019t see any shade in Halfis\u2019s face at that time, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad story.\u201cEverything seems to be at a meeting with the mechanic. No one will open their mouth with the story that I can\u2019t tell you the details yet. Yeah, Tomas\u2019 guy was called up, too.\u201dThey even call me Tomas. Thomas is a blacksmith, but naturally because he is most deeply involved in the creation of magic props.The mechanic was also consulting on the machining of parts when moving magic props, so would he convert the technology to an instrument? Maybe a new work will be born in the world, working hand in hand with the musicians. If you think so, my chest is bouncing.\u201cI owe this to Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe nobles cannot make magic props alone. Even if magic is the prerogative of the nobles alone, it is the job of the civilian population to tailor the part that forms the foundation of the magic props. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve had a reciprocal position or anything\u2026 the nobles have shown a lot of interest in our work lately and listened to us more than before.\u201dI looked back at Nico and the smiling tailor woman\u2019s face.\u201cGood aristocrats have been eager to listen to us for a long time, but indifferent aristocrats have never paid attention to the contents of our work. That\u2019s not to blame, but I knew I felt the distance. Oh, they\u2019re not like us.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201d\u201cBut with His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere sending demonic props to the world, the nobles also began to pay attention to our work. It makes me nervous, but it\u2019s worth it more than before.\u201d\u201cGood, then\u2026. but if you were a tailor, wouldn\u2019t you still benefit so much from the magic artifact?\u201cThat\u2019s right. But what about now?Ni, with a pranky grin, says the tailor woman in a mix of laughter.\u201cTomas, he asked me to tailor some fine clothes because I had to go to the castle. Aren\u2019t you going to stay only with the nobles, if this flow continues in the future? The hard-headed craftsmen may even be called to a feast that cares about the eyes of the nobles.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 was there such a demand\u201d\u201cYep. Besides, I wonder if I can use the processing technique of the spiritual stones knitted by the engineer with His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere.\u201d\u201cIn clothes? That\u2019s an interesting idea!I see, there may be a way to use the technique of processing magic props in your clothes!\u201cIf it\u2019s just going to be processing spiritual stones, it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s gonna work.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But I\u2019ll hang it from up there. Because I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cHehe, thank you. Her Highness Sister Wang. \u2026 you stay put\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dI tilt my neck at the words thrown at me suddenly. Then the tailor woman looked at my face as merciful.\u201cAt one point, Tomas told me that there was a time when I was thinking very much about it. Was it before Her Majesty Queen Uphilia was yet adopted by the royal family\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 oh, yeah. I think it was a long time ago\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone was worried. You are free and free. Besides, he wasn\u2019t even royal, and he spoke to us casually. If we were in trouble, he used to hang on to the king, and as an adventurer, he used to give us a hand in the trouble of town.\u201dHo, exhale and the tailor woman lays her eyes down.\u201cSome people said if His Royal Highness would be king, some people would just as well let him be king.\u201d\u201c\u2026 anxious to leave it to me?\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I was wondering if you would lose your smile. It was our anxiety that you might change.\u201dOpen your eyes where you were lying, smile softly and look at me.\u201cHer Majesty Queen Uphilia has come to power, and you are now in your position. Still they exchange words like this unchanged. That\u2019s what makes me happy.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cSo just celebrate what hasn\u2019t been celebrated before. I know some noblemen still don\u2019t feel comfortable about Her Royal Highness Wang, but if we can celebrate your birth, we should welcome you with all our heart.\u201dAll I could do was snort back without words to the words I was told to smile softly.Thank you. I had to start with this seemingly zero tear to convey the word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: 94Busy hours had passed like a run, and it was my birthday day day if I realized it.The people were already festive in Castle Town. The store is lined up and lively people are interested in eating and drinking.The royal parade moves on to scratch the vibrancy of such people. I\u2019m dressed in a bespoke dress for the day and waving as I sit next to Uffi. The people who rushed for a glimpse of the royal parade are smiling and waving at us.\u201cYou\u2019re as vibrant as ever.\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to think of the country as a sign of its richness, but if things go well after this, you won\u2019t have to complain.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dSneak in and exchange words with Uffi between the parades. Seeing this festivities, the people don\u2019t seem to have any problems for now.I know it\u2019s bad for the knights who are looking around, but I want you to try your best to protect this sight.Later, after this, I have no complaints if the aristocratic presentation I refrained from at night, the night club celebrating my birth, goes well\u2026\u2026(Lang, I wonder if it worked in the end\u2026)With half my expectations and anxiety, I decided to concentrate on my work waving at the people.After the parade, take a short break and then re-color it in preparation for the show.The sun is completely setting and the night is coming. In the hall for the feast of the royal castle, the nobles who participated in the show converse thoughtfully.Much to the sight I had become accustomed to, I entered the venue with a bowl of grace with Yufi, breathing.\u201cYour Majesty the Queen of Uphilia, Your Royal Highness the King of Anisphere is hereby admitted!Our entrance will be announced and our gaze will gather if we step into the venue. The first person to stop by was Halfis and Marion\u2019s new Countess Anti.\u201cDear Uphilia, Dear Anisphere, be in a good mood\u201d\u201cGood day, Halfis.\u201d\u201cBe in a good mood. Should I call you Countess Antie?\u201cUgh! Don\u2019t make fun of me!Calling her Countess with teasing feelings, Halfis blushed her cheeks just a little and narrowed her eyes. Marion, who was in arms with Halfis, looks a little embarrassed, too. It\u2019s the first time, these two are.\u201cOh hon\u2026. Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. Happy Birth Again\u201d\u201cThanks. It\u2019s totally past its original due date though.\u201dThe Kingdom of Palletia does not exist in four seasons as clear as Japan in its previous life. The climate is stable and constant, and even if there are changes, there are rainy seasons that continue to rain.The year of the Kingdom of Palettia has been made into a division named after the Spirit, with light, fire, earth, water, wind and darkness named after the Original Plains and the four great Spirits for a total of twelve months each.Each of these two months is divided up and down, and spending the last month of the light, the last month of the light, becomes the last month of the fire. The dates are divided into seven days a week, and this one is attributed to the Spirit, which is also used in the month division, and is filled with days of the week without a day as a holiday.By analogy with the date, the last month of the light, the second week of the fire day, becomes the notation. A year is when light and darkness meet, and when they become one, they circle, and when the season passes again, light and darkness begin and end respectively.I was born in the following month under fire, and in the spring of the previous life, the equivalent of April was born.\u201cNo, it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve celebrated like this, so I\u2019m not comfortable.\u201dI haven\u2019t had a party to celebrate my birthday in over 10 years. It\u2019s okay because it\u2019s still an easy-going dress, but my shoulders still look stiff.\u201cI can tell you that the Ministry of the Spirit has been blessed with a good opportunity.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I hope it works out\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThe greeting was there, too, and Halfis and Marion disappeared into the crowd. These are the two people who have just succeeded the Count Anti family, and I guess there are still people who need to say hello.People come to a substitute greeting that even after Halfis and Marion leave. Even when they greet me in this way, my face has largely stopped being drawn to me. People are creatures they get used to.Well, I\u2019m inferior to Uffi, who\u2019s dignified and sociable next door. It\u2019s like the water keeps flowing. I still laugh and often delude myself.\u201cHer Royal Highness the King of Anisphere, Her Majesty the Queen of Uphilia. The festival by the Ministry of the Spirit will begin shortly. Please move to your seats on the stage.\u201d\u201cIs that already the time? Yeah, all right.\u201d\u201cShall we come, Anis?\u201dWith all my greetings and guidance from the butler, I head with Uffi to the royal seat on the stage.In the traditional ritual, it was a way of celebrating the year by giving the words of celebration here and then consuming a lot of spiritual stones, but this time I think it turns into an entertainment led by the spiritual ministry and applied magic prop processing techniques to the instruments.What kind of reaction does that get? I have no objection if I can and I would like it to be accepted\u2026\u2026\u201cMm, are you here? Annis, Uffi\u201d\u201cFather, Mother, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re in the mood.\u201dFather and mother had already sat in the royal seat on the stage. Sit alongside Uffi in the remaining vacant seats.\u201cAnis, did you socialize properly?\u201cYeah, well.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ufi?\u201cMother-in-law, Annis is still unfamiliar, but if you do this a few times, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026 if that\u2019s what Yuffi says, let\u2019s do that\u201dMy mother has asked me a bit of a frightening question, but I got nothing. No, don\u2019t put pressure on me to get to a celebratory seat like this. Oh, no, no, no, no.It was Lang who came up on the stage as he was desperately distracted from his gaze from his snug mother. Up on the stage, Lang looks over at the participants gathered at the venue.\u201cParticipants, please be quiet. Again, let me now carry out a festival to celebrate the birth of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. The host is me, Lang Voltaire.\u201dLang gives a bow of grace, then calls to the venue. Then the gaze of the participants who were bickering gathers to Lang. The gaze that can be directed at Lang is varied.Lang pierces a faceless expression that does not move his expression. And then, once again, I turn my gaze to the seat where me and Uffi sit.\u201cAgain, Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. I\u2019m late for my original birthday, but thank you for entrusting me and the Ministry of the Spirit with the partitioner for the birthday.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it is an excessive word for me that I have so far scorned my royal duties. In the future, we want to recognise our pride and consciousness as royalty and to do our part. Without the proposal of the Ministry of Spirituality, this opportunity would have been taken up until next year.\u201d\u201cTo keep up with your expectations, this one is ready to challenge you for today\u2019s Birthday. Now, until now, let me offer my congratulatory words, and celebrating the birth by wearing a blessing by the Spirit Stone was the traditional birthday formula. But the remarkable reform by Her Majesty Queen Uphilia has increased the demand for spiritual stones\u201dLang\u2019s words were addressed to us as well as to the participants in the venue. Seems like the color of tension has increased within the quiet venue.\u201cWe have carried out a review of the traditional rituals that consume large quantities of spiritual stones, now full of anticipation and hope in various respects in the propagation of the propaganda achieved by Her Majesty the Queen of Uphilia, as advocated by Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere. The Ministry of the Spirit has once again given the country a mission to inherit and tell about culture and tradition. We believe that we must adapt the culture we have built to the changes we have made in our time. But change must not mean disconnection of tradition. It is by inheriting the past that we have the present.\u201dLang\u2019s speech continues. Lang clears up between you so you can breathe.\u201cHopefully this event by the Ministry of the Spirit will be a new tradition that will connect the past with the present. Here is the light and darkness of the original plains, the protection of the four great fires, the earth, the water, the wind, all the spirits that are universal in this world. With this congratulations we celebrate the birth of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere and offer our prayers to the Spirit. And this is the blessing I give to His Royal Highness King Anisphere Sister from the Ministry of the Spirit. \u2013 Orchestra, forward!Make a forceful declaration after Lang reads out the congratulations. At the same time, it is the musicians with the instruments who come in from behind on the altar, which was arranged separately from our altar.All the instruments held by the musicians were strings. Violin, viola, cello, contrabas. And it was the colour of the instrument that caught my eye. The instrument was color-coded as if it represented each spirit with white, red, tea, blue, green, black.\u201cIn lieu of the original ritual, today we dedicate a song to celebrate the birth of His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere by means of an instrument specially ordered through the machining technique also used for demonic props, and we hope for the protection of the Spirit. Ladies and gentlemen, listen up for a moment.\u201dLang thanked him and raised his face and looked to the conductor who stood before the musicians. The conductor, instructed by Lang\u2019s gaze, nods with a slightly tense look.The venue\u2019s light is also dropped, and the conductor lifts the baton where it dims, \u2013 and the performance begins.The song played is a song that celebrates a common birthday in the Kingdom of Palettia. Man and Spirit walked over together and lived hand in hand. So it\u2019s a song with a desire and a prayer to give this child, born in this country, protection and blessing as well.The musician\u2019s skill is also impeccable. A comfortable performance continues to be played in the ear. Then I realized that Uffi, sitting next to me, made me jump on my shoulder for a moment.\u201c-Annis.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?Yufi called my name with a slightly rubbed voice. Something crossed the edge of my sight when I thought it was unusual for Uffi to speak up during the performance.The light was shaking loosely at the venue where the light had dropped. I remember seeing something similar to that light. It\u2019s a sight in the depths of that black forest where I visited Lhumi to explore the truth of the Spirit Covenant.Fluffy, six-colored light drifts brightly as it plays. It is obscure in shape compared to the Spirit obeyed by Rhumi in the Black Forest, and the intensity and presence of light and everything is thin.\u201cYufi, what is this\u2026\u201dInquiring about Uffi with an accidental breath, Uffi was narrowing her eyes and smiling softly. Uffi is a spiritual contractor. That\u2019s why I exhale as I was convinced by the way I daunted somewhere that there was something to feel.\u201c\u2026 oh, really? If chanting is about bringing prayer, wishful things to the Spirit, then music can also be said to include chanting.\u201d\u201cThen when you play with an instrument processed with demonic props\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will be invited to the Spirit and given form. It\u2019s just not as clear or practical as magic.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Fluffy, the spirits that were flying around to pull the tail of the six-colored light that was drifting in the air begin to gather beside me. And the light falling zero falls like scaly powder. It\u2019s like waving a scaly powder of light at me.To a very fantastic sight I hold my breath and stretch my hand over that scaly powder. Then one light wrapped Spirit after another approached me so that I could touch him, and he jumped around the venue like he was shaking.\u201cSpirit stones are gifts from the Spirit. The Spirit is a fragment of the world, a mirror that reflects the will of man. If you play with your wishes, the Spirit takes shape in response to prayer. \u2026 this is an indisputable blessing. Anis.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wow, that\u2019s beautiful\u201dI accidentally zero my admiration breath. Was that the same for all the participants, even in the dark I could see that everyone was chasing with their eyes the light flying around the venue.The performance also enters a good environment, and the musicians\u2019 performance is feverished. And the end comes to bite the aftertaste. The sound slowly interrupts and the light of the Spirit fades away with the end of the performance.Eventually \u2013 the venue was all wrapped up in the sound of applause at once to hang up and start applauding as someone remembered. I also forget me and give applause to the musicians.Even as the musicians sweat on their foreheads with their well-done faces, they give thanks. Then, while I was paying attention to the musicians, I noticed that Lang was coming to the royal seat.\u201cHer Royal Highness Princess Anisphere\u201d\u201cLang\u201d\u201c\u2026 I would like to congratulate you sincerely on your birth. Blessings and blessings be upon you!Lang kneels down and gives a thank you. Again, applause and cheer boil from the venue.I was looking at Lang in a state of oblivion, and then Yufi shook my hand. My gaze is off the lang and directed toward Uffi.There was something that conveyed my cheeks with that momentum. It was only after a moment of delay that I realized it was tears, and when I realized it was tears, my tear glands were stimulated at once.I wondered how she could cry so much, and I could see Uffi nodding small as she held my hand.Yuffi\u2019s expression is a gentle smile, and he keeps looking at me with his eyes like he sees a toddler. That Uffi gaze led me to the answer to my floating question.\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed by this world, haven\u2019t I? To the people who live in this country, to the spirits who seem to stop by.\u201d\u201cYes. Until now, you did not wish to be blessed for being heretical. But this blessing would never have been born without you. Anis.\u201dUffi reaches out and wipes my tears.\u201cYou are now living blessed by this world. They respect that raw thing. So laugh.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yeah\u201dI can\u2019t stop crying. But you don\u2019t have to stop it.Slowly I rose to my seat and I turned to Lang in tears.\u201cLang Voltaire. It was more than I expected, this achievement deserves my amazement too. An endless thank you to the Ministry of the Spirit for all that it has done for this day. \u2013 Thank you for celebrating me.\u201d\u201c- It\u2019s an unbearable word. Please, have a healthy year. And we look forward to blessing you again next year on your birthday.\u201dWith his knees on, Lang smiled at me and said so.See you next year. Protect and bless the Spirit to the sons born in this world.This would be an achievement that everyone would acknowledge. All I could do was smile satisfied.\u201cLang\u201d\u201c\u2026 Miguel?\u201d\u201cOops. Tired.\u201dAt the end of the festival dedicated to His Royal Highness the King of Anisphere, the presentation returns once again to the social setting. Everyone is talking about how touched they are tonight, rapping about it.In that corner, Lang, who was keeping his back on the wall in a hidden shadow, called the familiar name of his face sneaking in without sound to snort.Miguel, called by name, stands as if to keep his back next to Lang, floating as usual. A glass of wine is held in his hand.\u201cDid Her Royal Highness the King of Anisphere give you heartfelt praise for stroking your chest?\u201c\u2026 hmm\u201d\u201cDude, I\u2019m praising you, huh? Good for you. Now you\u2019ve got the face of the spiritual ministry, haven\u2019t you?\u201cWell. I just want to hope this excitement never ends.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not being honest either.\u201dMiguel flaunts his shoulder at Lang, who reacts more and more.\u201cIt is not yet sufficient to investigate instruments that have undergone the same processing as demonic props. I tried several times, but depending on the skill of the musicians, it may not have been possible to express the Spirit. Nor is it true if even the same musicians always ask if they can summon the Spirit. Still unstable technology.\u201d\u201cThis will be enough for a short time.\u201d\u201cThat is also only because of the accumulated research of His Royal Highness Sister Wang\u2026. nothing is my handle. This is just the result of the royal sister-in-law.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not really honest, you!Miguel looked back toward Lang as if he were frightened, keeping his eyes rounded.At the end of Lang\u2019s gaze is the figure of Anisphere talking to Uphilia. He looked at the two of them, slightly loosening his mouth and smiling.\u2013 Maybe it was easy.\u201cWhat?\u201cIf I had thanked you, maybe there would have been a different future\u2026. I just thought so. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201c\u2026 maybe\u201dGently lift the wine glass Miguel had in one hand. There\u2019s another glass of wine in Lang\u2019s hand too, where he kept his back on the wall, trying to put his arms together.Miguel laughs joyfully and Lang lifts the wingslass to the same position as each other in a sigh.\u2013 Cheers. Quietly the sound of a glass of wine was played.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95: 95That was the sight I saw on my way home from finishing my job as an auditor at the Department of Defense.I see a face in the hallway of the royal castle. That was Raini. Across the street from Raini stood a man, looking at each other like we were in trouble.\u201cRaini?\u201d\u201cAh, Master Anis.\u201d\u201cThis is Her Royal Highness the King.\u201dRaini, voiced, gives a gentle thank you, and the man standing opposite him gives a deep thank you. Raini is a samurai outfit, and the man dressed as\u2026 a cook?You saw it in another rare combination, and I speak up.\u201cHe looked like he was in some kind of trouble, but something happened?\u201cNo, it\u2019s not important\u2026 I was hoping to ask Lady Raini for her feedback.\u201dThe cook man scratches his head like he has trouble with what to say. Long, limp, fleshy, lean, etc. To stay out of the way, the hair is pulled back and tied like a tail.Amethyst-colored eyes shake left and right at the lack of location, and slight tone of tension can be felt. But I don\u2019t get the impression that I\u2019m scared, so I think you\u2019re simply concerned about me in the royal family.\u201cMr. Nair. Ask Anis what he thinks at this time.\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you sure, I feel terrible\u2026\u201dRaini tried to get me involved. Then the cook man, called Nair, is anxiously shaking his shoulder. My gaze at you and me looked very troubled.\u201cIt\u2019s not important, but I think Raini should solve the problem?\u201c\u2026 right. When I hear about Mr. Nair\u2019s work environment, I think I\u2019d better do something about it.\u201d\u201cHuh. I wish I could take a seat somewhere. Was that Nair? You\u2019re a royal cook, aren\u2019t you? Do you have a break room, a refrain room, somewhere free?\u201cTo invite Her Royal Highness Sister Wang\u2026\u201d\u201cFine, never mind. You suddenly have trouble being taken to a salon or something, don\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026 right\u201dSpeaking with the salon, Nair let him shake his neck left and right with a bitter smile. Because it doesn\u2019t feel like nobility to see. You have trouble getting something taken to the salon, don\u2019t you?It seemed a little awkward, but Nair\u2019s guide led us to the cooks\u2019 quarters. There are other people taking breaks, and when you see me, you turn your gaze at me.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to take a seat. I don\u2019t even want to thank you. Sorry to bother you.\u201d\u201cAnd, but\u2026 hey, Nair! You, what have you done!\u201cYes, no, if I had consulted Lady Raini on an example, I would have asked Her Royal Highness Sister Wang for her opinion\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, well, maybe so\u2026 but that\u2019s why I can\u2019t believe I called the royal family into such a modest room\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026. Well, I\u2019ll explain it well around, so I don\u2019t blame you guys for anything.\u201dI don\u2019t have to explain it to you. I think you can do it. And there\u2019s Raini as an explanator, and we\u2019ll get Raini to do something about it.\u201cSo? What was Nair talking to Raini about?\u201cThat explains from me, doesn\u2019t it? Mr. Nair would like a supplement.\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u201d\u201cDear Anis, as you can see, Mr. Nair keeps the kitchen of the Royal Palace, but the cooks have had common problems lately and there is no way to solve them. I have a feeling too, so I was wondering if I could help.\u201d\u201cHmm? But it\u2019s not important, is it?\u201cYep. But I think it\u2019s a pretty big problem for the cooks.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?It\u2019s about your meal, Mr. Uphilia.\u201cUffi\u2019s meal?I didn\u2019t think the center of the problem was Uffi. I turned my eyes round. Huh? I don\u2019t have the impression that Uffi is having any problems with the meal.A little confused. You understood my signs, Raini smiled bitterly and scratched her cheek.\u201cNothing. That\u2019s not why Master Uphilia is having eclampsia or leaving a meal behind. Instead, they eat exactly what they serve.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201c\u2026 whatever you serve won\u2019t change your reaction, Your Majesty.\u201dNair groans as he drops his shoulder disappointingly. Other people who listened to us are dropping their shoulders, trying to follow the depressed Nair as much as they can.Hmm? That whatever dish you serve to Uffi won\u2019t change your reaction? You think that\u2019s a serious enough problem to talk to Raini?\u201cIt\u2019s only a concern from the cook\u2019s side that Her Majesty has nothing to do with it\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can eat without leaving a meal\u2026\u201d\u201cI can tell you it was delicious properly, and you can work for it\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what Her Majesty prefers.\u201d\u201cUffi\u2019s food preference?When one begins to speak, he speaks blurry troubles as if he were going to hitch a ride around as well. I had my eyes set on the content.\u201cYep\u2026 so, um, we\u2019re both very concerned about dedication\u2026 not to mention the minor problem of moving to the Kingsguard Knights dining room where we want some people reassigned\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Nair also originally worked in the Cavaliers\u2019 Dining Room, but a change of placement meant he was in charge of Mr. Uphilia\u2019s meal.\u201d\u201cAs good as it gets? Um, so the problem with the cooks is that they don\u2019t know what Uffi\u2019s dietary preferences are, and they don\u2019t know what to serve, and Uffi doesn\u2019t complain at all, so on the contrary, that\u2019s what pressure feels like and the work environment isn\u2019t good?\u201cI\u2019m ashamed\u2026\u201dHe is scratching the back of his head with a face like the nail is impudent. It wasn\u2019t just Nair, the other cooks had the same face.But it\u2019s Yufi\u2019s meal\u2026 This leans my neck a bit, even for me.\u201c\u2026 I thought it was the effect of becoming a spiritual contractor\u201dUffi is a spiritual contractor. The sensibility is closer to the Spirit than it is to a person\u2019s. I thought I was living my daily life unharmed because I was Ufi who originally had a sensitivity close to the Spirit, but do these fine distortions come up?Originally, Uffi is also a character who does not act as a standard for his likes and dislikes. If you can eat it, think that\u2019s good or something. Right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to eat this because I don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s served.But that makes you unhappy or anxious from the side that serves the food. That\u2019s what a king of a country speaks of. They should be more aware of the gravity of their responsibilities than anyone else.\u201cI can\u2019t ask directly from the cooks, and I\u2019m a little concerned too\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Ilia cares about that\u201dRaini also thinned, saying he was concerned about Yufi\u2019s low interest in food.Hey, should we do something about this? But it\u2019s not the same thing to tell me to eat it\u2026\u201cIf I said I could talk to him at a time like this, would he be the only one?\u201d\u201cLumi, it was just fine!A corner of the garden that your father manages. When I even went out to the square for the tea party, I found Lyumi sitting in a chair lazily.Lyumi has accompanied us from the Black Forest before staying as a guest. That said, I just got a room, and I usually disappear freely and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.The corner of Father\u2019s garden was one of the spots where Lhumi often surrendered, and there was a person he was looking for when he visited and saw it at no good source.\u201cOh, Anis. Still busy. How are you?\u201cBecause energy is the handle. So there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you?\u201cWhat do you want to hear?\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you about the spiritual contractor\u2019s dietary situation.\u201dI ask Lyumi as he sits down in the opposite seat of Lyumi. Lyumi opens her eyes just a little, and then she looks at me surprised to narrow her eyes.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWhat kind of blow? Not that I\u2019m stingy\u2026 but are you finally going to be aggressive?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a spiritual contractor, and that\u2019s what I wanted to hear about my dietary preferences, my appetite,\u201d\u201cOh, not about the secret of love with the queen?\u201cChitty, chitty, chitty! O, don\u2019t burn the extra care!That\u2019s not what I meant by \u201cmeal\u201d! No, I know that eating my magic is more nutritional than anything else for Uffi, but it\u2019s not, because it\u2019s not\u2026!I feel bright red at once. Keep my cheeks down and breathe. He had a grin that reminded him of a cat if he looked back in front of him. This ancestor really has a bad personality!\u201cYes, sir. So, about the meal? Why are you doing that again?\u201cActually\u2026\u201dI explain to Lhumi the current situation of Uffi and the concerns of the cooks as I chew up the content to Lhumi. Llumi, who had returned his careless gavel while sitting idly, but by the time we finished talking, he had corrected his posture.\u201cAs long as it\u2019s done, I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cI knew if I became a spiritual contractor, would it affect my appetite or something?\u201cI will, what\u2019s in my soul is the spirit. There will be enough appetite to maintain the flesh, which is a vessel, but the desire to eat that, the desire to eat this, will be about a hobby. Neither do I.\u201d\u201cOh well\u2026\u201dDoes it make a difference in senses from normal people after all? Even with appetite, it is magic to consume it as food for the Spirit. Food is only a vessel, a nutritional intake to maintain the flesh.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of maintaining your flesh, you\u2019ll still be fine. Maintaining the flesh will be a hundred million robberies, and if you throw away the flesh, it will clear up and join the Great Spirit.\u201d\u201cWhat about Rhumi?\u201cI\u2019m pretty corrupt stuff. You like it? Human food. Anything from gastronomy to ghetto.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s just a hobby.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026. Although I may not receive and feel the same way as Ufi because I have never been raised as a legitimate person. That kid\u2019s something similar, but still would be better than me. I just can\u2019t shake the fact that it\u2019s magic that feeds the Spirit. That is no exception even for spiritual contractors. We would be satisfied if we had magic. A normal diet is just a nutritional intake or a hobby.\u201dMmm\u2026 I knew it. Then it may be difficult to feed Yufi his favorite dish.For the Spirit Contractor, a normal diet is not required more than the maintenance of the flesh. The Spirit is inherently thinner as a desire because it has no flesh. As long as you have the magic power, as long as you have enough nutrition to maintain your flesh, you won\u2019t even care.Even if that\u2019s what it is, Uffi is the queen. It\u2019s complicated for a cook not to suddenly make a meal into a substance or something elaborate. And when the queen takes the initiative and refrains from eating, I can\u2019t even say that it doesn\u2019t affect her surroundings either.It\u2019s a big deal, but it could also be the beginning of the abolition of the culture of cooking because Uffi doesn\u2019t stick to cooking. I don\u2019t think appetite can be obsolete because it\u2019s the three greatest cravings of people, so it\u2019s only enough to be cut off.Anyway, I want to lay low on the side where there will be extra pursuits. It\u2019s hard to leave this one case alone where Ufi\u2019s governance is stabilizing but could spread Ufi\u2019s anomaly.\u201cIt\u2019s not good if you\u2019re having fun as a hobby. Which way does it take to maintain the body?\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2019ll just ask Yufi. I might ask you to talk to me again, but then, please, Lumi.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. You can thank me with magic.\u201dPeeling, and tongue-in-cheek, Lumi stroking her lips to look as if she were inviting something. I realized what that meant. I bluffed and turned my back. Your ancestors, maybe you\u2019re joking, but weigh yourself in!\u201cWhat\u2019s Yufi, your favorite food or something?\u201cYes?\u201dAfter finishing the Queen\u2019s affairs and returning to the House, I decided to ask Yufi, who was exhaling. It was at the edge of my sight that I saw Raini reacting and listening.Yufi had blinked her eyes properly at my inquiry, but she puts her hands on her mouth as if something were bothering her.\u201cEspecially when it comes to this\u201d\u201c\u2026 meat, fish, see, you got something, right? I like this flavour \u2013 or I hate it the other way around.\u201d\u201cIs it your dietary preference\u2026 what you make into a common man\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t fit your mouth very well. Like the dishes served at the stall of your patience. It was fresh, so I guess I\u2019m just not used to eating it rather than simply liking it or not.\u201d\u201cOh, that happened\u2026 well, then you don\u2019t usually eat this because you think it\u2019s delicious?\u201c\u2026 you weren\u2019t very conscious. We all thought it would be the same if we ate it. But it\u2019s necessary to appreciate the flavour, so it doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t tasted it and eaten it.\u201dNo, no, maybe I\u2019m not wrong, but I\u2019m not. There was a place where Yufi was natural and uneven, but even in places like this, I would show off that kind of natural!?\u201cMeals are fun stuff, right?\u201c\u2026 if the magic of Anis\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh! Huh! Ordinary meal!The Spirit Contractor is this, so already!\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m so worried about my meal. From a standpoint, the possibility of poison cannot be discarded.\u201dMy lips bend over to Yufi, who replies somewhere in trouble. This could be more problematic than I thought?But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m wasting ingredients, and it doesn\u2019t seem like the flavor matters because he said he could have a taste reputation or anything.You mean you simply don\u2019t feel the joy of eating? I\u2019m eating because it\u2019s an awesome obligation, and I feel like I\u2019m hissing the air. This is definitely not just because I\u2019m a spiritual contractor\u2026\u2026Uh-huh, I don\u2019t know what to do, this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: 96\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026\u201dI was roaring in my own workshop in the outhouse. It\u2019s about Uffi\u2019s dietary situation that\u2019s bothering my head.I also asked Yufi himself, but I still think he has a low desire for a meal. It\u2019s more than becoming a spiritual contractor. It\u2019s an inevitable problem.But that would put extra pressure on a royal castle-based cook, and could deprive him of his enthusiasm and accomplishment for the job.I\u2019d like to get rid of it somehow, but I can\u2019t come up with a good idea. The problem is that what is the staple food of the Spirit is not food, but magic.\u201cHow do you use magic to cook\u2026\u201dI define magic as something like blood that has no entity, something that overflows the elements that make up the soul. So people have inherent magic power for everyone, and it has to do with the amount of magic and the affinity with the Spirit of each attribute.As far as that\u2019s good, I can hardly think of a technique that purely uses magic alone. Besides, what if we were to use that for cooking?\u201cMagic\u2026 magic\u2026 magic into cooking\u2026 mix\u2026? Grant magic to ingredients\u2026\u2026? But can you imagine how delicious the magic is\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about bumps by yourself?\u201cUh-huh!?\u201dAll of a sudden I\u2019m so surprised at the sound of a call from behind. I was totally alarmed because this is my workshop.It was Lhumi who spoke from behind. Seeing how surprised I am, I\u2019m grinning that the sound of being a jerk looks good on me. You sexually evil witch!\u201cIf you\u2019re coming in, knock\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. You still let this distract you and put your face on, didn\u2019t you? I don\u2019t have an island to install anyway, so you\u2019re worried about making sure Uffi can enjoy his meal somehow, right?Lyumi sits next to me, trying to sit down on her desk. I think I got a flashing look when Lumi pointed me out.\u201c\u2026 hit\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not well.\u201d\u201cShut up. And it\u2019s not just about Uffi, it\u2019s about the cooks\u2019 willingness to do their job, and if a spiritual contractor is born in the future, we can make the most of it.\u201dI don\u2019t know if I can do it.Lyumi was pulling in a grin and erasing her expression. The voice was pale and created an atmosphere that reminded Lhumi that he was outside.\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201cAs long as there\u2019s nothing magical about it, the Spirit will be content? Is it worth bothering to make that available in the form of a meal?\u201c\u2026 Either way, if you need a meal to maintain your flesh, you should enjoy it\u201d\u201cWould that really make you happy for a spiritual contractor?Rhumi packs the distance so he can peek into my face. Strange eyes with multiple colors of light mixed together, but from close range, I can tell that the original eye color is light green. He looks at me like those eyes are worth it.I don\u2019t know if it would really be good for a spiritual contractor to be able to consume magic with a meal. Even if I could make it, I don\u2019t even know if the Spirit Contractor would like that.\u201cYou can think about that later after you\u2019ve done it. If you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t give up, and what you\u2019ve done won\u2019t go to waste.\u201d\u201cIt could just be a roundabout, right? A human life is a short one. It\u2019s too late to regret it later, huh?\u201cStill much better than not doing it and regretting it. We have to start something. We can\u2019t go anywhere. Then I\u2019ll do it anyway.\u201dI tell you without distracting myself from the Rhumi and looking straight at it. For a while Lyumi and I were gazing at each other, but we strayed our gaze like Lyumi had taken root.\u201cYou really are an idiot, Anis. It\u2019s a lovely barbarity.\u201d\u201cThanks for that.\u201d\u201cThen shall I tell you?\u201c\u2026 what?\u201cEven the Spirit rejoices, how people eat\u201dLiumi smiled as she returned her deviant gaze to me again. The smile was faint and was going to melt and disappear.Then we\u2019ll get started.\u201c\u2026 can you cook rumi?out-of-house kitchen, I was getting ready to cook as Lumi invited me.I wear the apron I have prepared for each other Ilia and my hair is tied up so that it is not disturbed or stopped with a hair fastening.Long hair that seems to cling to the heel of the rhumi is knitted into three large pieces by Ilia. Llumi looks at me as I rock the big three braids bracketed in two.\u201cTo the crowd? We only had a lot of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I hope so. So? How do you cook for people who like spirits?\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the usual cooking procedure. I\u2019m just gonna put one hand in there. The quickest way to do this is to use spiritual stones.\u201dSaying so, Lhumi lined up the spiritual stones next to the ingredients. I unexpectedly see Rhumi as a ghost.\u201cA spiritual stone\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, this is my own thing, isn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t steal it from a boulder.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u2026. I don\u2019t doubt it, do I?\u201cYes, sir. Now, if you\u2019re going to use it for cooking, I\u2019d prefer something that doesn\u2019t belong. Spirit stones of attributes that match the person you feed on the next point. Otherwise, it could be blood or meat. But you can\u2019t mix that with people\u2019s meals, can you?\u2026 Well, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not nice to have blood or hair in the rocks for cooking.But is it still a spiritual stone here? How ironic it seems to be to be an unattributed spiritual stone that was also said to have few ways of using it.\u201cSpirit stones can be magical. Use it with condiments in its magical state. Even spirits can consume magic while enjoying their meals.\u201d\u201cSpirit stones are not stingy to use in cooking because they can sometimes be used as medicines\u2026 do they taste good?\u201cOf course, if you keep using it, it\u2019s subtle. I used it finely crushed and mixed with seasoning, like salt.\u201d\u201cSalt, salt.\u201dSalt is also in circulation in the Kingdom of Palletia, but there are two routes to obtain it.The first route is to take salt from the sea. The current mainstream of the Kingdom of Palettia is this way. However, it is said that the sea in this world is more dangerous than on earth. Because the demons that live in the sea are quite a threat, combined with the interests of the land.So even if villages and towns are created along the sea to recover salt, it can be devastated by demonic damage. Still, the value of salt does not waver, so villages and towns continue to be created by pioneering the coast, even at the risk. If you say which is better than the border, it\u2019s probably better because it\u2019s still close to the Wang capital.Another way to get it is rock salt. Until they started taking salt from the sea, they were rock salt when it came to salt. Although the Kingdom of Palletia has a territory facing the sea, there are many unexplored places along the sea, and they used to take rock salt better.\u201cBut don\u2019t you care about the texture or something? It\u2019s not like the Spirit Stone is going to be salt.\u201d\u201cRight. So it must be a waste of time to include magic in your diet. Always people don\u2019t benefit that much, and if you consume too much, you can get sick. So as a guide, the wind flavoring is ideal. It would be tasteless and odorless for people, but if it\u2019s a spirit, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dShould I think of it as something of a medicinal meal dish? If the pills pass, it\u2019s poison, but if it\u2019s the right amount, it serves as a magic restoration. Because for humans, external magic needs to be tamed by their own bodies, I think it has something to do with magic that makes them ill because they consume too much.Um, can\u2019t we make effective use of this not only for spiritual contractor meals, but also for cases of lack of magic?\u201cEven so, you were a little surprised. Lumi was studying cooking.\u201d\u201cSo unexpected?I thought you were breaking up your hobbies.\u201cHey\u2026 honestly, did you cook properly over a hundred years ago\u2026?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYou must be really ok!?\u201d\u201cShut up, you can\u2019t just magically heal yourself if you get hurt. I\u2019ll stick to one of my fingers myself.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Lumi, don\u2019t grab the knife. Just put your mouth out behind you.\u201dI guess I have to educate the Spirit Contractors to take care of my body more!? I\u2019m already dangerous and anxious to make Rhumi cook, I\u2019ll take the lead and cook and go.\u201cEnnis, please use your magic. I\u2019ll crush the Spirit Stone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 then okay, yes\u201d\u201cThanks\u2026. I kinda miss you\u201d\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t study cooking for no reason\u2026. I used to pick up orphans and raise them.\u201dTo Rhumi\u2019s words, I unwittingly stop my cooking hand and turn my gaze to Rhumi.\u201cWere you raising a child or something?\u201cIt was a long time ago. Talk about when I was just young.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that, hundreds of years ago?\u201cI don\u2019t know. If you untie it in the history books, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\u201c? Why a history book?\u201cIt\u2019s a boring story\u2026. Well, maybe you still wanted Annis to know\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cIf you look at the times when witch hunting was happening, it\u2019s just back then.\u201dIt\u2019s a lumi that tells me to be nothing, but I\u2019ve put a little effort into the gaze of seeing a lumi.\u201c\u2026 Speaking of which, they used to call me a witch.\u201d\u201cYep. If you were headed for the reign of the day, you\u2019d be a witch at some point.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d\u201cI just preached on the dangers of spiritual covenants. So heretical interrogation, the witch-certified execution course. Well, I ran away.\u201dTong, says Lhumi with a disgusting grin as he punches himself in the neck with his finger. I flaunted my face as much as I could at how Lumi was doing.\u201cThen you started hiding in the clouds, didn\u2019t you? I wasn\u2019t as ambitious then as I am now. Oh, I guess you got too close to a jerk. Mistake me, don\u2019t try to understand anything, hold your mouth to the wind you find out, and call me a witch with it. You deserve half of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 how does that relate to orphans?\u201cBecause the orphan I raised died in a witch hunt. A child taught by an evil witch. I just picked it up on a whim.\u201dI\u2019m stunned and breathtaking. Lyumi just goes on with her pale words without changing her expression.\u201cSeems like the orphans I picked up had a lot of confusing circumstances, but I don\u2019t remember them very well anymore. It\u2019s just that I picked them up on a whim to try and raise them. Then I tried to get her to cook for herself. Tell me that if you don\u2019t eat with me, it won\u2019t taste good, and I\u2019ll think of a cooking method that makes you eat with me and think it\u2019s delicious\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m having trouble reacting. All of a sudden they talk like that.\u201dThe person talks like it\u2019s nothing, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t know how to react.I had never heard the details of what kind of life Lhumi, the living witness of history, had lived as the daughter of the first king, because he was often in smoke. I think I\u2019ve been through that, too, and I get emotions that are hard to describe.Then Rhumi smiled bitterly and strayed from my gaze.\u201cThat\u2019s the same, isn\u2019t it? \u2026 just a little bit of a burden.\u201d\u201cLosses?\u201d\u201cAt that time, if I were to hold fast to the kings of the time and be stopped by the tide of the supremacy of the Spirit. Then I wonder if those kids didn\u2019t have to say anything about witch girls. And then you didn\u2019t have to let them take over until this day and age, or something. I can\u2019t help it. So this is my casual sentiment.\u201dRhumi exhaled as she rolled the spiritual stone in her hand to swallow it. The narrowed eyes aren\u2019t here. They look like they\u2019re looking somewhere.\u201cI\u2019m just a busy man showing up at a time of change, nothing more or less. But there\u2019s something I can tell you because I\u2019ve lived long enough. This is one of them, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t want to be pitied because I told you about the past. So I just thought it would be a good opportunity.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes\u201dIf you say so, you can\u2019t even tear it up. Even if I want to say something, I can\u2019t think of a word.I kind of figured that out because Rhumi didn\u2019t want any other words of comfort. This is nothing more than a story of the past and the fact that it\u2019s over in the Llumi.It\u2019s not like I want you to grieve with me. I don\u2019t want you to comfort me. Either that or it\u2019s fear. I remember, I can\u2019t forget, but I seem to refuse to let that emotion weather.So tell the story. Don\u2019t leave your memories behind. I think I got a glimpse of one end of the outwardness I feel for Rhumi. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a grave guard.Without forgetting the many dead you\u2019ve nursed, you can\u2019t even interact with the living. It\u2019s like a shadow of an era that keeps shaking between life and death, between memory and oblivion.\u201c- Anisphere, you can\u2019t be like those kids.\u201dI felt that the words of Lhumi, who told me without looking at me, were only a little trembling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97: 97\u201cI\u2019m back now\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201cWelcome home, Uffi, Raini\u201dYufi and Raini returned to the outhouse after completing their respective work by the time the sun completely went down and it was night.I was preparing dinner in anticipation of the two of us coming back, and I was on my way. Stop the hand of the discipline, look back and welcome the two of you.\u201cI\u2019m ready for dinner, can we have dinner first?\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still hungry today\u201dYufi nodding as usual, Raini holding her stomach and blushing a little shy.With a smile on both of those, I line up my meals on the table with Ilia, who helped me prepare.\u201c? That\u2019s a lot of fun today.\u201d\u201cYes, because this evening\u2019s dinner was prepared by the Anisphere\u201d\u201cWhat, did Master Anis make this?He looked at me like Raini was surprised. Yufi is also neatly rounding her eyes.\u201cI feel a little good about it. Come on, eat it before it gets cold.\u201d\u201cI have no problem with the taste. You may have some concerns.\u201d\u201cI wonder if you\u2019d like me to share that with you later, too.\u201dFor once, it was a meal for Uffi, but Raini, the vampire who seeks magic, is with him. If it can also be effectively utilized by Raini, it may reduce the frequency with which you develop a bloodsucking impulse.Although Ilia also tried it, I thought it could be used as a normal meal if I didn\u2019t even care, although the taste of spiritual stone still caught on as a flavor.The bread and stew, then a salad of raw vegetables, were prepared today. Many of these menus may be qualitative as royal meals, but because I\u2019m not good at eating in format.There\u2019s going to be about two more dishes when Ilaria prepares them. If it\u2019s me on the boulder, I can\u2019t get enough of this. I\u2019m going to ask you to meditate on the prototype dish.Spirit stones are refined or melted into powdered pieces when making bread or stews. I have checked with Lyumi to see if my magic has settled properly.I guess I\u2019ll have to see how it reacts after you eat it. I hope it fits my mouth.Come on, let\u2019s eat.\u201cYep.\u201dFrom all about the seats, prayers before meals are offered to the Spirit. Then we start eating.The first thing I took in my hand was bread, and I threw it into my tease mouth with my hand. The texture feels a little uncomfortable compared to the bread I always eat.I don\u2019t think the taste is a problem, but I ask her horizontally how Yufi and Raini react. Just now, I could see Yufi hauling it into my mouth like pecking a thousand slices of bread smaller than me.\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Piku. Yufi\u2019s movements stopped. For a moment, my eyebrows are jumping and staring at the bread in my mouth.Oh, what, that reaction. I\u2019m a little scared, Yufi?\u201cWow.\u201dThen next door Raini leaked a strange voice. Keep your mouth down, Raini is blinking and staring at the bread over and over again.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201cHow, uh, is this magic\u2026 right? Dear Annis.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a dish I made to contain my magic.\u201d\u201cBi, I\u2019m surprised\u2026\u201dPhew, Raini exhales as she exhales for a long time.\u201cUh, did it fit your mouth?\u201cHuh? Oh, yes\u2026. Mm-hmm. I think you\u2019re going to be very hungry soon.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201cUh, yes. I don\u2019t know\u2026 magic makes me feel very full\u2026 it\u2019s hard to feel, this\u2026\u201dRaini is laughing like she\u2019s in trouble. It\u2019s refreshing to me, even when I\u2019m told I\u2019m full. Ilia also looks at Raini wonderfully.The bread uses less spiritual stone, but what about stew? This one is stew, so I made it because I thought it was okay to use spiritual stones more often than not.\u201cCan I get a taste of the stew, too?\u201cYes\u2026. muggu\u201dWhen Raini spooned the stew and carried it to his mouth, he raised another weird groan. Raini shudders puffy with her hands on her mouth to hide her groans.\u201c\u2026 so, are you okay?\u201c\u2026 stew is more intense\u2026\u201d\u201cUnpleasant?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s outrageous! I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m really having trouble with my thoughts, and I\u2019m not dissatisfied!Waving patsy as he panicked, Raini began to elucidate.\u2013 It\u2019s delicious.\u201cHuh?\u2026 what, Ufi\u201dUffi, who was eating beside Raini like that, raised his voice. When I turned my gaze to Uffi so he could catch me, I turned my eyes round.The bread, stew and salad I had prepared for Yufi was clean and refreshing. When did you eat that?\u201cWhat, it\u2019s not fast to eat\u2026?\u201c\u2026 because it was delicious\u201dTo my whining, Yuffi replies with her eyes closed while gently wiping her mouth with a napkin.It was me who was distracted, but more than anything, I was horrified when Yufi told me it was delicious.\u201c\u2026 Anis, I\u2019m embarrassed\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 do you have an alternative?\u201cWhat. You like it that much?\u201cRight. If there\u2019s an alternative, I\u2019d like to eat some more.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a little left. I\u2019ll take it with me now.\u201dIlia takes a seat and starts lowering the plate once to replace Yufi. Then I saw Uffi twitching a little, and I accidentally blew it out small.Is that Yuffi replacing you? I have to thank Lumi. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to put it on my regular table, because I\u2019m going to need a spiritual stone for the ingredients.\u201c\u2026 Wow, this is awesome\u2026 but\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201dSeeing Yufi eating, Raini is also proceeding with his meal hand with a grunt that seems troubled. But it never seems like a bad reaction.The substitutions prepared by Ilia are then arranged in front of Uffi. Uffi was elegant in that, but I could see that he was moving forward sooner.\u201cHehe, I\u2019m glad Yufi liked it\u201d\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t possibly dislike it. Because it\u2019s the magic of anise.\u201dOnce, Yuffi returns the word to me as I stop my meal hand and wipe my mouth with a napkin.\u201cI was going to cook this meal because I was also consulted by a Royal Castle cook?\u201cUh, yeah. Can I hide it? The cooks were talking about not knowing what Yufi likes and what kind of food to serve. But Yufi was a spiritual contractor, and you had a weak reason to stick to your meal, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s why I talked to Lumi.\u201d\u201cSo is this dish?\u2026 Except for including magic, you\u2019re not particularly hands on anything, are you?\u201cIs it normal, except you\u2019re using spiritual stones for ingredients? But I think I need to do more research because there are parts of it that are concerned about texture.\u201d\u201cIs it a spiritual stone\u2026 I guess I\u2019m the only one who needs this meal, so there\u2019s no reason to serve it at the royal castle\u2026\u201dYuffi nibbles with a bitter smile as if he were in trouble somewhere. Besides, I get a little mucky.\u201cEh, now that you\u2019re queen, just say my word for a minute. Even the cooks are in trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026 in the future, I will try to communicate what I want to eat properly as a request. I can feel the use of precious spiritual stones on boulders for me. I don\u2019t mind if I let it out of the palace. And Raini.\u201d\u201cHa-ha!? Well, yeah\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Raini started earlier. Why are you acting suspicious like that?\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026 no, that, I\u2019m having trouble with my thoughts\u2026!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u2026 Why are you having trouble with your thoughts?In the end, the meal ended watching Uffi, who had flattened the meal beautifully, and Raini, who was suspicious of behavior until the end.\u201cHmm, you didn\u2019t really know if you succeeded or failed this time\u2026\u201dAfter eating and bathing I was worried about today\u2019s achievements in my own room.It was a pleasure to find that the meal itself containing magic worked for Uffi and Raini, but after all, Uffi seemed to care about the use of spiritual stones.If you\u2019re going to serve it out of the palace, there\u2019s no problem, but it hasn\u2019t been a fundamental solution to the cooks\u2019 problems, has it? Um, I was wondering if I could settle for magic other than using some other spirit stone.\u201cNature and magic will fall out over time even if you use magic when plowing the land with dirt spiritstones\u2026 I hope you can impart magic to the ingredients, but the consumption of spiritstones seems to be of concern to Yufi\u2026 study if there is any other way\u2026\u201dWhen I turn my thoughts, I stick to myself more. I looked up when the sound of knocking on the door to block my concentration in my thoughts sounded.\u201cAnnis, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cUfi?\u201dIt was Uffi\u2019s voice that I heard from across the door. I take my seat and go open the door. Beyond the door was Uffi, dressed in her bedroom clothes.Did you just come up from the bath or I could still see the redness on my skin. Looked like he came straight up from the bath.\u201cYufi, what\u2019s wrong?\u2026\u2026I asked him if he needed anything, but Uffi just looks at me.But are you out of your mind that those eyes just seemed a little risky? It\u2019s kind of like my lips are just a little pointy too.\u201c\u2026 you said that Lumi taught you how to be. Is it her manipulation\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHa, and he sighed, and Yufi lay her eyes down. Lumi? What\u2019s wrong with Lumi?Uffi then enters my room in a moment of confusion. I thought I closed the door with my back hand as it was, and the distance between Yufi and me narrows at once.With his hands on his chin, he is forced to raise his gaze slightly. Keep it up. Yuffi lays his own lips on my lips, and his breathing snatches away.\u201cHuh -?!\u201dI round my eyes for a sudden kiss, but I can\u2019t get away with it because Yuffi fixed his head so forcefully.Yuffi kisses me enthusiastically as he pecks me so many times not to let me get away with it, but I leave my thoughts flying all at once because of the sudden feeling of my lips touching each other.\u201cHey, Ma, what, Ufi\u2026! Holy shit\u2026\u2026!I manage to let my hands break in and try to escape Uffi\u2019s obstinate kiss. Then Yuffi\u2019s eyebrows distorted in dissatisfaction.\u201c\u2026 you really don\u2019t know what you did. Lumi is bad for people too\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, huh? Hey, what? What do you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026 it has indeed become a magic replenishment. It was a great meal. But, Anis\u2026 you\u2019re going to be short.\u201dGloss intersects Yuffi\u2019s exhaling tricks. If you look closely, Uffi\u2019s eyes are moist and her cheeks are red.The hands that accompanied my cheeks were fluttering and trembling, and it seemed as if Yufi was enjoying something for a long time. That, somehow, is so cute, but you can\u2019t look at it directly\u2026!\u201cWhat\u2026? I mean, what\u2026?\u201cI felt very stirred up. You put up with me till this hour, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re ready, aren\u2019t you? Anis.\u201d\u201cNo, no!? No, that, let\u2019s discuss it, Uffi! I just wish Yufi could have a delicious meal\u2026!\u201cYeah, it was delicious. \u2026 to the point where I\u2019m stirred up wanting more, to the point where I can\u2019t stand wanting more\u201dLew, Lewmee!? What the hell! I didn\u2019t hear this was gonna happen!?Oh, wow! Duh, duh, duh! Yufi\u2019s eyes suck like never before! They\u2019re gonna eat me! They\u2019re gonna eat me like this!\u201cThat\u2019s enough, right?\u201cHey, what\u2026?\u201cAnis is mine, right?\u2013 So I won\u2019t let you get away with it.Without having to put it into words, Uffi\u2019s sharp and feverish gaze tangles me up.Oh, yeah. You can\u2019t run anymore. Such a give up came to mind, and I pulled out the power of resistance.\u201cFor the Spirit, ingestion of magic, especially the magic you like, is the best source of nourishment to keep you alive. If I can take it with a meal, I can certainly consume magic while enjoying the meal. But for the Spirit, eating means the same thing as eating a human diet, doesn\u2019t it? Have you studied?\u201c\u2026 teach you? Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll bust you later to thank you\u2026\u2026!The next day came Lhumi, who fell down on the bed and couldn\u2019t move, with a niggling grin beneath me. And it is this dialogue. I accidentally skipped the kill with all my might.Magic is exhausting and lazy, and your body is exhausted and lazy. Especially\u2026 that, hips, but\u2026 oh, oh! Don\u2019t be conscious, me! Don\u2019t remind me! Give me that ugly state of last night! I was shattered by all the older majesty and shame!?\u201cHey, Yuffi was so glossy today.\u201d\u201cExplain it all properly\u2026! Even me if I knew, I\u2019d be careful, I\u2019d be ready for my heart\u2026!\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. I thought it was gonna be crazy, so I kept my mouth shut.\u201d\u201cYou witch! Oh, there he is, sounds on his hips\u2026\u2026!I tried to wake up my body unintentionally to Rhumi telling me to make fun of him, but I can\u2019t keep up with my hips. My whole body is lazy and I\u2019m not going to get up.Ku, ku, yufi\u2026\u2026! also, I don\u2019t think you can give me a little more relief!? Oh, no more, I don\u2019t like it, but I remember! Yesterday, my, ugly\u2026! There\u2019s nothing left to be seen\u2026 I don\u2019t know what face to go with Yufi anymore. No! Uffi idiot!\u201cYes, yes, a treat. Why don\u2019t you take your time? Sister Wang?\u201cRemember, Lumi! I will definitely clear this grudge!! Remember! Ooooo!!\u201dThis is all my fault too, this sexually evil witch\u2026\u2026! I will never, ever forgive you!!I could only smile with a niggling smile and stare abominably at the flickering Rhumi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: 98Me \u2013 Raini Sian\u2019s life is full of waves.At first, he was a civilian, and since the loss of his mother, he has lived as an orphan. I wondered if she had been taken by her adopted son as a baron\u2019s maid, and now she was born into an exclusive maid with Her Majesty the Queen.It may be a glorious birth street from people\u2019s point of view, but it\u2019s not the birth I wanted. It was just that the result of my choosing would emerge in my choice. I am in this job because I wanted to repay those who owe me.Besides, I have secrets I can\u2019t tell people. My identity is a vampire. A monster who sips man\u2019s life, who was born at the end of the obsession created by man\u2019s madness.There are few places I can live with such secrets. And even in the sense that I have someone I want to repay, my only place is away from the palace, where there is Lady Anis and Lady Uphilia.But lately, I\u2019ve been feeling like I want to exhale in that resting place. That depressed me terribly.\u201c\u2026 ha\u201dGetting out of my mouth is a heavy sigh. The cause of melancholy is a bunch of letters stacked in front of me.The letter, which steadily increased with my increased chances of ascending to the royal castle as a samurai of Uphilia, is likely to build a mountain already.\u201cAgain, you\u2019ve got quite a few\u201d\u201cAh, Master Ilia. Good morning.\u201dAs I roared in front of the mountain of letters came Iliah, my colleague in the outhouse and senior and teacher of the maid. It\u2019s the same faceless look, but I know very well that if you get used to it, you\u2019re a kind person. There are places where you can see things.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to reply when this is the only number\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. Sometimes they ask me out directly, and I say no.\u201dI drop my shoulders disappointingly. This pile of letters that arrived to me are all letters from men who are offering to make me their fianc\u00e9e.I usually sleep in the outhouse, so I try to get my letters to the outhouse. I used to arrive at Baron Cyan\u2019s mansion, my parents\u2019 house, but one day my letter to you was turned out of the palace to hang up on me for consulting with your father.Your father\u2019s consultation is because I had a massive engagement consultation. Besides, some of them are offers of engagement from top noblemen who can\u2019t think of a meeting coming in a regular baroness, so your father was totally in trouble.Baron status among the nobles is low. Among other things, your father is actively involved in spreading magic, and he has a good memory from Anis because of the presence of me. Now the Ministry of Magic and Science is also increasingly being called as a tester of magic props, which is preparing the ground for birth.That\u2019s where the problem was with my existence. I am very close to Master Uphilia and Mr. Anis and I am not that tall. More and more men are pressing for engagement with such eyes on me. Even if you refuse, it\u2019s bad for your father if the other person is a high-ranking aristocrat. Said it would be hard to say no.Ennis, the Lord of the Outlying House, who heard it, will make sure it reaches the Outlying House, and will write a refusal reply with Master Uphilia. I\u2019m honestly a little sorry for feeling like I\u2019m causing you trouble.\u201cSince Halfis got married, there\u2019s been a sudden increase\u2026\u201d\u201cThat means the people who tried to powder Master Halfis are coming to me, right?\u201cI would say yes.\u201dI think that the increase in the number of visits to my engagement is also heavily influenced by the marriage of Master Halfis.Now as Countess Anti, Master Halphis is active in the Ministry of Magic, unfortunately demonstrating that blossoming talent. For the title of Annis and Uphilia\u2019s apprentice is worthwhile.Many people want to get close to Uphilia and Anis in the midst of a big change in the way the country is. But you two are deeply bonded, and there\u2019s no gap to get into.Then my age, affordability and low status make me dressed up. Everyone leans their necks to see if Algard and the others forgot what they could rub. I\u2019m sorry to be the two dancers in that case anymore\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t you have it in Illia?\u201cIt\u2019s not as good as Raini\u2019s, but it arrives fine. It\u2019s incinerated without even reading it.\u201d\u201cYep\u2026? Is that okay? It.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not willing to take it, and whatever my parents tell me, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of damage my parents suffer\u201dI laugh bitterly at Yilia, who says it all the time. I zero my sigh as to how easy it would be if I could do that. Unlike Master Ilia, my parents\u2019 home is important. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to rub it.I knew I\u2019d have to look through the letter and say no, but then I\u2019d have to ask the Anis and the others. I\u2019m so sorry about that.\u201cHey, Miss Raini! Hope you\u2019re in a good mood, you\u2019re a stranger here!\u201cThis is Count Mallow\u2019s son. Good mood.\u201dUgh, and I paste a smiling mask by hiding the expression I went out to the table. A man of good width called out as he walked through the royal castle.Son of Count Mallow, this man is an aristocrat who works for the royal castle. He\u2019s going up to the castle with you as an assistant to your own father and helping you with the job.Apparently, I don\u2019t actually know much about Count Mallow\u2019s son just because I asked him about it in a biography. I\u2019ve heard rumors like that from fellow samurai that they\u2019re after \u201cthe handyman\u201d.And he\u2019s also one of those people who sent me an engagement offer.\u201cPlease stop calling me other manners. You don\u2019t mind me calling you Paulette, do you?\u201cPlay. I\u2019m only a samurai.\u201dAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t want to get involved with each other, but I try not to break my smile whining inside.Looking completely unaware of my insides, Count Mallow\u2019s son shook his cheeky flesh in an upbeat mood. You won\u2019t be good at people you don\u2019t like by accident, and I laugh inside out.\u201cThat\u2019s itchy, you are! Speaking of which, about the other letter\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 a letter? Excuse me, what is this about?\u201cYou haven\u2019t checked the contents? I was hoping maybe because the reply had arrived in the name of His Royal Highness King Anisphere\u2026 You seem very fond of His Royal Highness King.\u201dHow can you not give up there! and inside, screaming I maintain a vaguely grinning look.Most people give up if they give these declined replies at Lady Anis and Lady Uphilia about their engagement offers, but it\u2019s a headache that occasionally these persistent people come up.\u201cI also know very well that Her Royal Highness Sister Wang will like you. She\u2019s a lady with good instrumentation, good looks, and no shame in putting her out anywhere. But isn\u2019t it a good time for Miss Raini to think about getting married, too?A gaze that seems adhesive entwines me. My stomach is getting as uncomfortable as it has gained weight, and my smile is about to break.\u201cI am only an adopted child. My parents have also told me that I don\u2019t need to inherit the house, so I haven\u2019t thought about marriage yet. I would like to serve on the side of Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness the King.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a fine effort, but that makes you both worried, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s about giving up one of your happiness.\u201d\u201cHappy, are you\u201dHappy marriage, huh? I honestly don\u2019t think so. The fact that you broke up with your mother because you hid my presence to keep your father out of trouble overtakes my mind. And I think of the people in the school that I\u2019ve driven my life crazy, starting with Master Algard.To me, I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s happiness. I knew the roots were civilians, and I had no connection to the duty of nobility. It\u2019s about me, but I laugh bitterly.\u201cI\u2019m glad you care. But right now, I\u2019m so happy that I can\u2019t help it. I have people to serve. I can work here. So I thought it was a marriage\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an unbearable story! You make a man cry, Miss Raini!\u2026 Yeah, you really are.Oh, we need to leave soon. It\u2019s time to keep your smile on the line.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Count Mallow son. I\u2019m on my way to work, so let me get back to you.\u201d\u201cAh, Miss Raini!Count Mallow\u2019s son reaches out to me as I step away from him. Someone broke in between me and Count Mallow\u2019s son the moment I thought they were going to grab my arm.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 (a), Dear Ilia\u201dIt was Master Ilia who went in between. He goes in between and gently pushes me to get the distance.Seeing Ilia enter between me, Count Mallow\u2019s son turns to Ilia with a breathtaking, frightened gaze.\u201cAre you obsessed with chatting with your lords in the middle of your work? You\u2019ve been born a long time, Raini Cyan.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry\u201d\u201cThe royal castle, that is also to raise awareness more as a maid accompanied by Her Majesty the Queen. Count Mallow, my son, I\u2019m sorry, but may I pick her up?\u201cAh, ah. Well, now I\u2026\u201dCount Mallow son leaving early. I looked back at me once, but soon I couldn\u2019t see that well-width back.The only place left is me and Master Ilia, and I\u2019m going to lose my powers unexpectedly.\u201cHa, that helped. Dear Ilia\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence. You were lucky, are you okay?\u201c\u2026 I think I\u2019m a little stuck in my breath\u201d\u201cNo matter how many times you push away, your persistence is inexhaustible.\u201dPhew, and the exhaling Ilia looked very good at that trick. Those eyes will see a cold color and your spine will freak out just a little bit. I seem a little upset.\u201cI wish I could do well too, but I\u2019m not very good at it\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause Raini doesn\u2019t seem to be able to hit people hard. All this is unsuitable.\u201dI will go, and my legs, which had been stiffened up like they were rooted because of what Ilia urged me to do, will finally be able to move.Proceed along the corridor of the royal castle alongside Master Ilia. The people passing through this hallway are sparse, and no one pays attention to us. To the extent that we meet each other.\u201cWhy did Ilaria go to the royal castle? What can I do for you?\u201cYeah, there was talk going on about adding personnel to the outhouse. So I met with the chief samurai of the royal castle.\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you out of the palace?\u201cYeah, there\u2019s talk going on about letting people in and out in addition to the samurai. For example, you\u2019re a cook. Since there was no fundamental solution to the dietary situation of Master Uphilia, the story was raised as to whether or not to make the meal to be taken in the royal castle a meeting with the nobles. It\u2019s a suggestion that the meal that Ufilia wants to eat is made by a dedicated cook outside the palace.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, I\u2019m not going away with inspections yet, but there will be more opportunities for that. Only me and Raini are slightly short on exclusivity at that time. Originally, we didn\u2019t have the manpower in the outhouse just to keep the results of the study of magic secret so that Master Anisphere wouldn\u2019t have much contact with people, and we\u2019re not the only ones around the outhouse. You don\u2019t have to let them live out of the palace, but you might get more people in and out.\u201d\u201cWe have a Ministry of Magic and Magic, and it\u2019s better if we don\u2019t just manage the results of the study of magic out of the palace.\u201d\u201cYep. Whatever it is, things will change a little bit from now on.\u201dIn Ilia\u2019s words, I find myself convinced but uneasy enough to seep out.If there are more people, we have to build new relationships again. But I\u2019m starting to think other people are scared. Originally, I wasn\u2019t good with people, but I think that became evident after I found out who I was.Was there anxiety on the table that it would work? Peek into me with the eyes that Master Ilia seems worried about.\u201c\u2026 Raini\u201d\u201cOh, yes! What is it!\u201cFatigue is on your face, for a while I will take your place exclusively for Master Uphilia. We also need to go up to the Imperial Castle. Take your time in the Anisphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 sorry\u201dI shouldn\u2019t, he said. Even if I think so, my heart doesn\u2019t follow me. It may have been more burdensome than I thought to be swayed with a conversation that turned me into an engagement.In the end, Ilaria took over my work. Uphilia told me that Ilia would explain it to me, so I headed off to the palace in a slightly heavy foothold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Welcome back?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m back now\u201dReturning to the outhouse, Master Anis finds me and leans his neck in wonder. I speak with a bitter smile at Master Anise\u2019s specs.You perceived something in my bitter smile, Dear Annis, leaking an unspoken voice like looking for words.\u201cEr\u2026 good day? You want me to make you some tea?\u201cNo, you can\u2019t let Lady Anise do that.\u201d\u201cThen go with the tea. I was just about to take a breath.\u201dIf you ask me out like that, I can\u2019t say no either. I feel sorry but nod and walk with Master Anis.When he enters the salon of the outhouse, Master Anis makes tea using magic props in a way he is accustomed to. I\u2019m making them ready. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying, but I wonder if it\u2019s a good idea to make them royal over and over again.\u201cWhat about Ilia?\u201cI happened to meet him, so he took my place.\u201d\u201cOh well.\u201dA short conversation. Until I\u2019m done preparing my tea, I drop my shoulders with a heavy heart.I feel heavy without interruption. Maybe that\u2019s all mental fatigue. Recent calls from men are likely to evoke the trauma of the past and cause me to catch my breath.I noticed that I was stunned because I heard the sound of Anis putting away tea made for me.Excuse me.\u201cGo ahead, not as good as the two of you, though.\u201d\u201cWhat will the royals do with the tea in the first place?\u201dTake a sip of the tea that Master Anis brewed for me. So I was finally able to exhale, and I lost extra power from my body.Master Anis is also sitting in the opposite seat drinking tea. After putting the cup back in the saucer, Master Anis turned his gaze to me.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down, okay?\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u2026 I just wanted to say, it\u2019s a little hard\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe again?\u201cAgain.\u201dAha, and Master Anis puts his hand on his forehead with a bitter face as he leaks his voice.\u201cNow who?\u201cCount Mallow\u2019s Paulette, right?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 I wrote a reply I declined. You\u2019re getting more and more persistent.\u201d\u201cSorry for the inconvenience\u2026\u201dI smiled bitterly and could only answer that.When I feel down, I have thoughts that come to mind. I know I should never say that, but I\u2019ve spoken that word out of a loose feeling.\u201c\u2026 me, you just annoy me wherever I am\u201d\u201cRaini\u201dMaster Anis looks a little angry at my whining and stares at me.\u201cRaini is causing trouble. Sorry about the guy who annoys you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut nothing. I don\u2019t think Raini is annoying. There are many things that helped Raini. So you don\u2019t have to be sick.\u201dMaster Anis\u2019s words are a little stronger, but very sweet. The back of my eye gets twitchy and hot.I don\u2019t like it when I\u2019m weak, but I realize it. I want the words I want. So I said something weak.I can\u2019t do this, I shake my head left or right. Lift the cup with both hands so you can get your mind back together and have tea.\u201cBut I guess I\u2019ll have to think about it in a bit of a hurry\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t leave Raini in all this state, can you? Have you heard anything from Ilaria about the future of the outhouse?\u201cUh, are we talking about more personnel in the outhouse?What I had in mind was a conversation I had with Master Ilia before coming to the outhouse. When I mouth my thoughts, Master Anis makes me snort.\u201cYes, I\u2019m not thinking about letting the boulders live out of the palace like Ilia or Raini, but I think it\u2019s time to increase the number of people who can take care of us and stuff around us. For Yufi, for me, we\u2019re going to be busier. There will be more inspections and other actions if you put your back in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 right\u201dI live out of the palace now, and Mr. Anis has not participated in government affairs to the point of being aggressive. But I know it\u2019s only a matter of time.Expectations of Dear Annis, both civilian and aristocratic, are great. As the founder of magic, it is not difficult to imagine that Anis will be asked to play a major role in the future.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? We\u2019re going to need manpower, and more people are going to be close to us. I don\u2019t think we can all get along, but I want to crush any element of anxiety. I\u2019m sure not all the people who understand the situation are told by Raini\u2019s man.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn fact, some of the samurai who work for the royal castle hate me too. I try not to get too involved with those people, but sometimes I get novels.Even though I don\u2019t know what else to do with all this, I\u2019m not convinced either because I don\u2019t want you to speak up. I just want to work for the Anis\u2026\u201cThe quick thing is you make someone. Halfis hastened his marriage.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 after all, I want to be close to Anis and Uphilia, because there\u2019s a connection, and I can\u2019t help but be kind to me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re bad at dictating Raini. You forgot one thing about Al? I think so.\u201d\u201chaha\u2026\u2026\u201dI do wonder if you really want to marry me for causing such a training ground. I have that suspicion that you can really like me myself.I don\u2019t think I want to get married, and I don\u2019t think I want a lover. I want to serve the Anis quietly as they are. Because I want to repay you for rescuing me from that helpless hell.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know who he doesn\u2019t\u2026 because Uffi was quietly pretty before this too\u201d\u201cHuh? Is Master Uphilia there?\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a mistress, shouldn\u2019t you think about inheritance? They said something like that.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dIt is already a well-known fact that Master Uphilia is drowning Master Anis. So welcome my son-in-law, even though no one says so. I don\u2019t have to be my son-in-law. I don\u2019t have the idea of a mistress or anything. Maybe I can think of this because I treat it like I\u2019m in my body.I do think inheritance is important. But Master Uphilia is questioning whether the next king is even a child born of a spiritual contractor. I recall talking to Lady Anis that the issue of inheritance should be considered after the situation in the country has been put in place.\u201cI haven\u2019t been invited to a boulder by my mistress.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to look into your heart, Master Ufiria\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s how chaotic things are. It\u2019s all unprecedented, so I\u2019m desperate to keep myself safe. Maybe I can\u2019t see underfoot\u2026. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t save you.\u201dAt the end of the day, I grin bitterly at Master Anis, who squeals and drops.It certainly doesn\u2019t seem like that Master Uphilia would have a lover besides Master Anis.I don\u2019t know who suggested the mistress, but I just think it\u2019s getting dark ahead.\u201cAnyway! Maybe it\u2019s time to try to flush it passively. If you can\u2019t stand it in silence, it\u2019s a shame. Raini can\u2019t stand it in silence, can she?\u201cRight\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you also tell Raini to look out for him\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 hey\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dPolitical marriage may be something I can\u2019t help but have a little bit of a ride for me that I still can\u2019t get out of feeling when I was a civilian.Master Anis and I sigh overlapping and spit out. I don\u2019t even think I know what to do.\u201cGo ahead\u2026 use the power of vampires already\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that\u2026\u201dIn the end, I tried talking to Master Anis as it was, but the solution didn\u2019t come up.My work as a samurai will be over by night. I was heading for the bath to sweat in the outhouse baths. It has become a habit to soak in the water completely since I started living in the outhouse, and I want to take a bath at my parents\u2019 house.It was quite a while ago that I had a bathhouse built in my parents\u2019 mansion with a salary that wasn\u2019t meant to be used thoughtfully. Now my mother-in-law totally likes it and is very happy with it. When I think it was because of the magic props developed by Anis, I think Anis is amazing after all.\u201cRaini, are you going to take a bath?There were signs that people were approaching me as I was taking off my clothes. It was Master Ilia who came in while avoiding the partition cloth at the entrance by hand.\u201cDear Ilia! Good job. Um, thank you so much for taking turns today\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind\u201dMaster Ilia keeps her baggage on the shelf and begins to take off her clothes. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve seen Ilia\u2019s body because we sometimes go into the bathroom together, but I fall in love with it more than once.You noticed my gaze, and Ilaria turned her gaze, so I hurriedly took off my clothes, which I was about to take off, and headed ahead to the bathroom to delude myself.Clean your body first. The precautions for taking a bath are taught by Anis, who seems to have various restraints. I don\u2019t think Anise is very interested in fashion or anything, but she is keen on washing her hair and skin. Is that all you like to bathe in?\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dWhy, when I go into hot water, I exhale naturally.Soaking it up to your shoulders in hot water that warms you up pompously feels like fatigue falling out of your core.I think it\u2019s a really great invention to be soaked in relaxing water because using magic props keeps the temperature constant.\u201cNeighbor, excuse me\u201d\u201cAh, go ahead.\u201dA little later than me, Ilaria can dip her body in the water. It won\u2019t take long because I haven\u2019t stretched my hair that far, but Master Ilia is quite long when she unties the hair she\u2019s knitting. So washing my hair seems to take a while.Although the longest out-of-house is Master Uphilia. The Uphilia does not seem to like long baths, but rather has cleansed her hair and body for a long time. He\u2019s restless to keep soaking it in hot water, and when it\u2019s the temperature that Anis prefers, he puts it right up.Master Anis seems to like being a little soaked in hot water. As much as I\u2019m going to put it up when I\u2019m dating you, I often take the most baths if you care about it.I think it\u2019s a little funny that there are fine preference differences in the same bath. By the way, I like to be soaked in a little lukewarm water.Speaking of which, you don\u2019t talk like that with Master Ilia. When I looked at Ilia sitting next to me, not knowing it, I closed my eyes and saw Ilia pulling out her shoulder strength.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u2026\u2026 Something? \u201c\u201cOh, no. This is how I use the bath, but I thought each one had a fine preference.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Master Anisphere prefers a long bath with hot water, but Master Uphilia is easy to put up.\u201d\u201cYes. I like to relax in warm water. You never talked to Ilaria like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that me?\u2026 If you insist, you could heat it up a little bit. I think you prefer long baths.\u201d\u201cHaha, looks like it\u2019s just Master Uphilia that doesn\u2019t take long baths\u201d\u201cIf we talk like that, Master Uphilia will be stubborn.\u201dThat\u2019s what Ilia squeals as she lifts her mouth just a little and smiles. I nod to agree, too.\u201cMaster Uphilia, if you\u2019re out of the palace, you\u2019ll see it all the time, but I\u2019m only going to do that here.\u201d\u201cYep. It\u2019s good to have a place where you can breathe.\u201d\u201cI really do. Master Uphilia will have a real hard time\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 what about you? Raini.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dNot anticipating Ilia\u2019s inquiry, I turn my gaze to Ilia.As usual, the faceless Ilia noticed her gaze on me as if she was complaining that she was worried only by her gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a burden, too? To the obstinate invitation of His Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it is, though. But that\u2019s all I am.\u201d\u201cYou may not think so, but we believe that the wounds you receive are not inferior to those received by Master Uphilia. It\u2019s just a difference in standing position. The scratches and burdens you suffered in that engagement break-up riot must be very heavy, right?Unexpectedly I pulled my lips hard and tied them. Bring your knees in by bending your back so that you sink straight into the water to your neck.\u201cSo much so that Master Uphilia suffers from male phobia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 after all, is that so\u201d\u201cIt seems to have calmed down recently, but it must have been Lady Anis. It seems easier to have distrust as soon as you get romantic feelings from a man. Even that Uphilia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think so, do I?Dark as it sounds to me, I answer vaguely. Maybe if they say yes, maybe they do, or if they say they think too much. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s me there.Because I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I didn\u2019t want to touch on stories involving romantic matters in the first place. Because I have long been swayed by problems involving the opposite sex. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m rejecting you more about romance than about men.\u201cI can\u2019t firmly say no. It\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m giving Anise and the others a lot of trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you say no clearly, depending on the person\u2019s response, it doesn\u2019t make it right either.\u201d\u201cSo what do I do\u2026\u201dI get my lips pointed like I\u2019m obstinate. If that were the case, nothing would remain to be solved forever.Even I know. He said if you can really get engaged, it\u2019s easy to make someone. I also have the trust that if I talk to the Anis, they will look for the right person with me.But I don\u2019t feel like I can be happy when I\u2019m engaged or married. If I were to be happy, I would serve Anis and Uphilia as a samurai.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have a hand.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI will take the same approach as Master Ennis.\u201d\u201cWith Master Anis\u2026?\u201cI\u2019m going to go around publicly saying that my paedophile is a woman.Oh, and I accidentally leaked my voice. Speaking of which, Master Anis escaped the engagement story by saying that women were better off originally.\u201cThen there will be fewer men to speak to.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that may be so\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like that, too?\u201c\u2026 I, I can\u2019t be in love in the first place. I\u2019m scared to fall in love with people or like them\u2026\u201dLosing my mother, being put in an orphanage and then being mean to boys, obsessed, they all went crazy.It was then that I began to live to lurk my breath so that no one would notice me. That hasn\u2019t changed since your father picked you up and made you a courtier.\u201cI\u2019m scared. The fact that I like me makes me crazy. I just like it, or friendship is fine. But love is scary. I can\u2019t stand people going crazy. No matter how much vampire power you can contain, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of\u2026\u201dMaybe I was desperate to gain control of my power in the end to escape that fear. I\u2019m not lying about my desire to repay you because that came true.But I want to turn away. From love itself, because people like it. Because I don\u2019t want to drive anyone\u2019s life crazy anymore.\u201c\u2026 Raini. One day, I told you. Do you remember telling a similar story then?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou decided to go home, back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, yes. You inspired Ilya back then.\u201dI remember. Even then, I did become mentally anxious and show my weakness to Master Ilia.I was worried if I could stay here, and I was afraid that the happiness of being able to stay in this warm place would be lost. Master Ilia encouraged me to do that. I can remember that day right away.\u201cI think you\u2019ve grown very much compared to those days. You\u2019ve been so enthusiastic about your job that you think you can leave it to me. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cUh. Oh, thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I could serve Anisphere and Uphilia with you like this, it would make me happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m so glad you said that\u201dThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t stand situations where you can\u2019t work well.My heart is distracted by the words of Iliah, which are more feverish than usual. It is very unsettling to have such delightful, dreadful emotions on your mind.Master Ilia is to me a work boss, a senior, a man of respect and goal. I\u2019m really glad you said that from such an Illia\u2026\u201c- So why don\u2019t you do it to me?So I didn\u2019t anticipate any of those next words.Uh. There are zero meaningless words out of my mouth. Although Ilaria is faceless, it is not natural as usual, but looks like a look she made somewhere.\u201cDear Ilia\u2026? What is that\u2026?\u201cI am loving you. As a junior, as a colleague, as a person. You talked about it one day. I\u2019m a lot of missing people. He was a man who knew only as much as he loved.\u201dMaster Ilia\u2019s hand reaches out to my cheek. I can\u2019t move with my back, and I just accept that Ilaria\u2019s hand touches my cheek.\u201cIt would hurt you to say something like this, knowing that you were once fascinated. Even so, I don\u2019t think I can do anything for you just by looking at it anymore. That doesn\u2019t seem to hold up to me anymore.\u201dIs it because my body was warmed by soaking in water? As I dyed my cheeks pearly, Master Ilia told me slowly, staring straight at me with a serious look.\u201cCan\u2019t I be the other guy? Raini.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: 100My head turns white. I haven\u2019t been through that once or twice.But the shock I\u2019ve had is the biggest I\u2019ve ever lived, and all I could do was blur while waking up my upper body on the bed from last night until I blurted.I was confessed by Master Ilia. That was making me stop thinking. In the end, I was unable to reply to anything yesterday, and I could only drop off Ilaria, who was leaving, thinking about it.I tried to sleep, but I don\u2019t feel like I could sleep at all. I don\u2019t know when I slept, and the time I slept is short. Just heavy head. Ever since yesterday, the expression of Illia has repeatedly disappeared.\u201c\u2026 Dear Ilia\u201dWhy did Ilaria say that to me? Given that reason, I\u2019m going to hold my head. Tightened enough to make my chest painful, driven by so much guilt that I want to stop breathing as it is.Master Ilia still hangs on to my charm when I\u2019m not aware to say I\u2019m a vampire. To that abominable cursed power that favors me.That\u2019s why he said he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. Because I\u2019m in pain. It\u2019s all my fault. It is my fault that I suffer without being able to say no properly.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault\u2026!It hurts me to feel guilty about letting Master Ilia say such a thing. Because I am impudent, because I have fascinated Master Ilia. Because I\u2019m here.I can only squat while holding myself to the voice of my heart, which repeatedly blames me. I\u2019m sorry, the words I repeat are powerless.I don\u2019t know what to do. I just can\u2019t accept the heavy reality, and I can only close and cage in my shell.\u201c\u2026 Raini, can I come in?I hear a knock. What I heard after that was the voice of Master Anis.I don\u2019t want to see anyone now. But it\u2019s painful to be alone. Without speaking out of such contradictory thoughts, Master Anis opened the door.Lady Anis looked at me for a moment, but immediately tightened her expression and closed the door. I walked straight over to the edge of my bed and lowered my hips there.\u201c\u2026 Ilia said today that Raini is not feeling well, so give him a break. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to see how it goes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 excuse me\u201d\u201cFine. My job is not stuffed with cuts. I\u2019m more worried about Raini than that.\u201dMaster Anis has turned his back on me because he has lowered his back to the edge of the bed. I didn\u2019t want to be seen in my face right now, so I really appreciated Master Anis turning my back on me.\u201c\u2026 me\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m, like, awesome, disgusted, I\u2019m already, like, bitter, I want to disappear\u2026 annoyed, I just want to give it back, but I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t like it all anymore, I\u2019m going to be scared\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt\u2019s a rupture. I\u2019m speechless, and I spin an interrupted word to wheeze. Even that word doesn\u2019t make sense, and I don\u2019t know why.Still, Master Anis gaveled at me and asked me quietly. Never look at me, but he\u2019s definitely there and he\u2019s listening to me.\u201cI, no longer, I don\u2019t know why, okay\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did something happen with Ilia yesterday?I cover my face with both hands in the inquiry of Lady Anis. Crushed by regret and guilt, my breath hurts. I just wanted to get easier, and I opened my mouth as if to confess.\u201cIf Ilia doesn\u2019t like me being told by a man, she can do it to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ilia?\u201cI\u2019m in pain, I see, I\u2019m in pain, but that\u2019s because I fascinated Ilaria, and I, also, drove people, it\u2019s important people, crazy\u2026!Hold your head with your hands that were covering your face, and I squat. Hold your own head with the momentum to your hair and spin your words with your final thoughts. With the momentum of my thoughts, my tears drop zero. Oh, I really hate myself for being so shallow.Lady Anis didn\u2019t say anything to me with groans and tears. I can\u2019t stop crying zero falling tears and zero whimpering. Dear Annis, who had been quiet about how much he had done so, stroked my head.\u201cRaini, look up\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cRaini\u201dMaster Anis calls me with a calming voice. I chewed my teeth off and raised my face with unstoppable tears intact.Lady Annis was laughing like she was in trouble for some reason. It\u2019s a delightful, but troublesome look.\u201cRaini, calm down first. Shall we take a slow, deep breath?\u201dPompous, and Lady Anis gently strokes my back. The hand that held my head when I raised my face shook at my lack of location, and Master Anis held my hand with one empty hand.Until I settled down, Master Anis held my hand all the way and stroked my back. I was able to calm down a little bit while taking a deep breath as Ennis told me.\u201cCalm down?\u201c\u2026 Yes. Sorry, dude.\u201d\u201cFine. Well, let\u2019s talk to me for a little while.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cYou know, Raini. I\u2019m so surprised right now, I don\u2019t know if I should be happy or lonely.\u201dLady Anise\u2019s expression still seems complicated. I know I\u2019m just as surprised as I say myself. Because I could see the colour of confusion in Anis\u2019 floating expression.\u201cOh well\u2026 I don\u2019t have that Ilia. I\u2019m surprised, and I miss you a little\u2026 but I\u2019m still glad.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201cRaini says Ilia cursed you with her own power, but I don\u2019t think so. To be more precise, I think it would be nice to be cursed.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201cIlaria\u2019s not obsessed.\u201dMaster Anis groans lonely.\u201cI wonder if I understand it properly these days. Ilia is going crazy as a person because she wasn\u2019t properly loved. I also think it was because of me. Because our relationship is so narrow that we can live without caring about others.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ilia also said that she was useless.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m the one who did that, right? I don\u2019t regret it, and if I\u2019m going to regret it, I\u2019m just going to piss Ilia off, so I\u2019m going to make sure I never do. But I can\u2019t overshadow the fact that I kept my relationship with Ilia distorted and left that distortion behind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 wasn\u2019t that something you couldn\u2019t do?\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can\u2019t change the past, and maybe I make the same choice over and over again. I can\u2019t give up Ilaria, I can\u2019t bend my claim. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t change Ilaria for you. I think that\u2019s what my relationship with Ilia is all about. \u2018Cause we both think we don\u2019t have to change.\u201dMaster Anis laughed in nature and said so. That was a heartfelt smile. It\u2019s a look that comes to mind that there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.The relationship between Master Anis and Mr. Ilia continues to this day because they do not need to change from one another.\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask each other for more than we needed. If you think it\u2019s preferable, that\u2019s enough, so long as we don\u2019t catch each other\u2019s breath\u2026. but I met Yufi and Ilia met Raini. Our relationship doesn\u2019t have to change, but our relationship with our surroundings changes. I feel lonely, but I can\u2019t help it. And I\u2019m glad from the bottom of my heart that Ilia likes people no matter what they\u2019re like.\u201d\u201cDear Anis\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if I can protect Ilia, I can\u2019t change it for you. Otherwise, we don\u2019t have to be different from each other. That scares me, too, and I\u2019m sure Ilia doesn\u2019t want me to either. I don\u2019t mean to be complacent, but I\u2019m the closest person to Ilaria, right? And we can be most comfortable with each other. He said it would be enough to have this guy.\u201dWith the hand Lady Annis was stroking my back, holding my head in. If I can hold it against my chest, I can hear Master Anis\u2019 heart.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a relationship that\u2019s sweet that you can stay in an easy relationship and stay the same, though. But I can\u2019t go anywhere, I can\u2019t change, because I don\u2019t need to change. I thought Yufi and I were happy that things had come to pass, but on the other hand, I was so worried about Ilia. Because I wanted to change.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Was it?\u201cYeah. So I was really horrified that Ilia would say she enjoyed caring about Raini and taking care of him. Any relationship would have been nice, if Ilaria could have changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is that the attraction of vampires, even if they are directed to like me?\u201cBut I don\u2019t think Ilia would have changed if I hadn\u2019t. If I can\u2019t change, Ilaria stays the same if I do. Just follow me with respect, and it won\u2019t be a forward relationship from there. I don\u2019t ask for a hang-up to change\u2026. I miss you.\u201dEnnis tries to match my temples and pack the distance. The hand attached to my head gently combs my hair with my fingers.\u201cI can change, there is now because there was Uffi who asked me to. I can\u2019t give up, but I\u2019m chasing the dream again that I gave up. Because I knew it was happiness. So I think it would be better if Ilia had someone like that. I\u2019d love that if it was Raini.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s how Ilia feels, not what she wanted\u2026?\u201cIs it Raini who decides that?A voice similar to a sharp reprimand makes me shudder. Master Anis gives me a really angry look, trying to grab my shoulder and face it back from the front.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like to think Raini\u2019s scared. I know what it\u2019s like to take responsibility for yourself. But, let me still say it. \u2013 Please, don\u2019t turn away from Ilaria.\u201d\u201cTurn away, turn away\u2026?\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what Ilia\u2019s trying to do. Even today, is things a little weird? I only knew as much as I thought. Ilia would never talk to me. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t even be Ufi. Ilia would never rely on people\u2026. I can\u2019t\u201dI take my breath away with the last words of Master Anis in his painful voice as if he were exhaling blood.I was out of sight of Master Ilia\u2026? I feel like my heartbeat is bouncing at Lady Anise\u2019s point.\u201cIt seems amazing to me that Ilia still said what she wanted from me. It\u2019s not necessary in my job, it\u2019s not what I have to say out of duty. I just don\u2019t want the words I wanted because I don\u2019t like Ilaria to be unobstructed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis, but I\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you think Raini is afraid of his powers. I think that feeling is important. But don\u2019t forget. It\u2019s just like my magic. What matters is how to use it. So don\u2019t forget, you let Ilia take a step with that power. It was a pleasure for me to be surprised.\u201dMaster Anis tells me to pray as if to me. The voice is gentle everywhere and makes me feel my feelings for Ilia. Anis really said it was about Ilya.\u201cAccept how Ilia feels, I can\u2019t say. But don\u2019t run away from facing each other. Tell him if you need time. I really can\u2019t. But tell him. I won\u2019t say anything, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the cruelest\u2026. Still, if you feel good about accepting Ilia at all, I want you to walk with me\u201d\u201c\u2026 What does Ilia look like to you, Anis?\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s hard. Though it\u2019s easiest to understand to say obedience. But it sounds like a family, and yet it\u2019s not. I really can\u2019t say. But I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s important.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What do you think of my fascination with Ilaria?\u201cHmm. Nothing at all? Because that\u2019s force majeure. But if Raini\u2019s charm cut me off and Ilia wanted to be someone other than me, it could also be my lover, or I wanted to be\u2026 I guess I\u2019m a little sorry.\u201dWords came back that weren\u2019t what I expected, and I accidentally circled my eyes. I don\u2019t think that Master Anis will regret it, and I stare at Master Anis.As a little lit up, Master Anis looked so complicated that he said it was hard to put into words whether he thought it was even him.\u201cIt\u2019s not like jealousy, and maybe it\u2019s not appropriate to say that I\u2019m really sorry. But in words, I\u2019m sorry\u2026. I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been by my side the whole time. Yet you walk away from me one by one. I regret it, I don\u2019t hang up, but I\u2019m so happy.\u201dLike trouble, but Master Anis did make me laugh. That smile is so cute, it takes my eyes off me.Like I gave you a hard emotion to say in a nutshell. That, but it\u2019s never unpleasant. Makes me think I\u2019m more respectful.Lady Anis truly cares about Ilia. I hope for that happiness. But to Ilaria\u2019s happiness, Anis can only push her back. Because I\u2019m the one who should take it.\u201c\u2026 Dear Anis\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m going to drown, it\u2019s painful. I\u2019m just as scared. Me, even when I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t know if I can stay happy\u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026!It has always been painful. It\u2019s been hard. It was like drowning, scratching algae every day.I was happy to be here. I was really happy. I wanted to spend this time like this.Losing this happiness scares me more than anything right now. I tremble, I squat, I want to reject everything.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026? What do you mean, you\u2019re okay?\u201cBecause I think you\u2019re scared. I don\u2019t care what you can do, like me, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t overlook yourself or anyone who thinks you are. So don\u2019t forget that if Raini helps you, there\u2019s someone there to help you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Anis, Dear\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Raini\u201dHe releases the question so that Master Anis sticks his core in his arms as he hugs him like he\u2019s about to lean over.\u201cWho do you want me to come and help\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
