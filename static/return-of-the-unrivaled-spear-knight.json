He groaned and had to prop himself up with his arms. His beloved spear, Lugia, the reaper of the battlefield, also lay helplessly on the ground.Four men and a woman surrounded the defenseless hero.Among them, an old man in a long black robe that hid half of his face spoke:\u201cFor a soldier like you, magic and divine power are fatal opposites.\u201d\u201c\u2026\" Joshua couldn\u2019t answer through the pain.\u201cThe shock alone of their collision would have killed any ordinary person.\u201d\u201cKeugh. Ugh\u2026 why?\u201d Joshua\u2019s gaze was heavy with disbelief.He never had any desire to usurp the throne.I wasn\u2019t interested in anything like that. I just wanted to shake off the contempt people had for the spear.He was proud to assist his master and only close friend in ending the Empire\u2019s long civil war. For the rest of his life, he wanted to stand by the Emperor's side as the shield of the Empire.However\u2026This time, a man in a white cloak stepped forward. His well-worn face bore a slight smile.Joshua knew this man.Master of the Magic Tower\u2026 Evergrant.Joshua ground his teeth at the sight of his Master.\"Joshua, there are people in this world whose mere existence is a threat.\"\"\u2026\"\u201cThe Emperor is free to exercise his grand ambitions. The entire continent? No\u2026 With the civil war over, nothing can stand in his way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you! You are the only thing the Emperor fears\u2026 Even warriors who have obsessed over mana techniques all their lives struggle to use mana on a small dagger. But you\u2026 you have that gigantic spear! How many men have you killed with that spear?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, beyond that\u2026 I know you crossed another wall long ago.\"\u2014Keugh.\u201d Joshua spat dark red blood again, despite his endurance.Evergrant\u2019s palm cradled a gray ball which began to emit an intensifying light.A medium that simultaneously channels both magic and divine power.It must\u2019ve been that ball\u2026 but it should be in the ruins of Amon. How did they\u2014A middle-aged knight took a step forward and faced Joshua. He wore golden armor adorned with a roaring dragon on the chest plate. It was the symbol of the Knights\u2026 Avalon\u2019s Knights.\u201cI\u2019m afraid of that spear too. Just looking at it made me feel like I was about to be attacked\u2026 It might drive me crazy.\u201dJoshua wanted to speak, but couldn\u2019t even open his mouth.The suppressed magic and divine power inside him began to collide, according to the will of the Master.In such huge quantities, it was impossible to even try to control it. Joshua simultaneously spat blood and groaned in pain.His consciousness flickered.\u201cJoshua, I would like to thank you; we owe the pride and success of the Empire to your help\u2026 I\u2019m truly grateful.\u201dAt this, Evergrant bowed deeply. It was a polite and humble expression of gratitude, befitting the most powerful person on the continent. Evergrant then straightened his bent back and whispered,\"Goodbye, old friend.\"For a moment, Joshua and Evergrant's eyes met. His eyes were sad but the corner of his mouth stretched into what looked suspiciously like a smirk. Joshua, having guarded the Emperor's side with Evergrant for a long time, knew exactly what that strange expression meant:Derision.Evergrant was mocking Joshua.Damn it\u2026Joshua snorted inwardly.As this happened, the Emperor of the Avalon was watching silently from behind them.Kaiser tilted his back and turned around.\"I can't watch, but, at the same time, I must see the end of a very close friend.\"Kaiser's voice was quiet and cold. His face however, showed a hint of sincere sorrow.Seeing the Emperor made Joshua suddenly nauseous. The charade was unbearable.Kaiser von Britten\u2026\u00a0Joshua muttered inwardly and clenched his teeth.At the same time, the magic circle on the ground brightened. Joshua knew this magic circle well: it was a type of explosive magic circle with the power to annihilate everything within a 50-meter radius.The gradually intensifying light made his heart pound.At this speed\u2026 Five minutes at most.What nonsense.The greatest knight of all time?What a joke.In the end, he was murdered by his friend in a random forest. The rage he felt right now defied words.Kaiser, don\u2019t think that it will end like this.He stared at the five faces watching him die and committed them to memory.In the middle of the endless pain, he swallowed and clenched his fists. He then went into deep concentration.Magic and divine power.He desperately tried to control the rampant beast inside him.CoughDark red blood leaked from his closed mouth. It felt like a decade or two to Joshua, but only a mere three minutes had passed.His will to live and thirst for revenge finally bent.Whoosh\u2026 whoosh\u2026 whoosh...Hearing the resonance in his ears, Joshua struggled to lift his heavy eyelids.Lu\u2026 gia?The dark red spear, Lugia, reaper of the battlefield, exuded a terrifying energy.As if telling Joshua to never give up.Lugia had rested quietly in the ancient ruins before Joshua found it and grew famous while wielding it.I knew that it had a special power in it\u2026 but I never expected it would show that power at a time like this.They had been together for decades but the power was never seen.Joshua became more aware of his surroundings, as if his survival instincts were being awakened.Like a possessed man, he desperately stretched his hands towards the spear. Joshua choked down the pain, telling himself that acting now would end the suffering.He sighed triumphantly when his hands finally met the spear.WhooshAnd then there was a bright flash accompanied by a thundering boom. The magic circle exploded with an earth-shattering Bang! With a violent roar, everything disappeared.A meaningless ending unfit for the Unrivaled Spear Knight.In the land of Knights, the Grand Duke of the Avalon Empire.Joshua Sanders.His memory was left untouched.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He immediately scanned his surroundings, though blurry silhouettes were all that welcomed him.He expected to see a gorgeous chandelier hanging above his head.He expected luxurious carpets to gently cover the cold marble floor.He expected various war trophies to adorn the maroon wall.But when he opened his trembling eyes once again, his vision was cleared. Joshua was not at all where he expected to be.There was no trace of luxury in this place.The shabby wooden roof was bare, coarse straw and haystacks littered the ground beneath him, and only horse dung perfumed the air.This was obviously not the Duke\u2019s chambers, but it was familiar nonetheless. Even if he wanted to, he could not hide the fact that this was his humble origins.He got up and examined his surroundings once more.Hey, what is this?Joshua\u2019s throbbing headache was forgotten as he looked around.It was undoubtedly the residence of Duke Agnus\u2019s family. This is where he lived but not quite his home.No way\u2026A sudden thought had him running like a madman towards the corner of the stable.Here horses can quench their thirst and can receive enough sunlight for the day. The windows are open and sunlight is streamed freely into the stable.It was also where he used to work out when he was a kid.What\u2019s happening? How am I here?He slammed the stable doors open. And\u2026The sight left Joshua momentarily slack-jawed.An enormous, beautiful garden was arrayed before him. The flowers\u2019 sweet aroma permeates the air outside, overpowering the smell of dung and evoking the depths of the forest.Blue roses scattered throughout the garden convinced him,I\u2019m really back.The rare blue roses could only be found in the Agnus territory.He spotted his reflection in a nearby puddle: a young boy with barely a wisp on his chin. And unlike his familiar head of bleached hair, his scalp was decorated with dark blue locks. His eyes were a deep blue which seemed to suck people in.It\u2019s obvious now that I\u2019ve gone back in time.Joshua felt a rush of both joy and sorrow. The raw emotions were enough to make him shiver and clench his fist. It was a strange expression indeed, and it made his face look rather creepy.Kaiser Van Britten!Joshua was in his early 50s before he returned. He didn\u2019t know his exact current age but it was clear that he\u2019d moved at least 40 years into the past.Kaiser was probably the same age as him. He\u2019d be the fourth Prince once again, with a long, arduous struggle for power and admiration\u2014and the throne.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\u2026!Joshua laughed maniacally. He was ecstatic because, for the first time, he can dream of getting revenge from Kaiser.And then...\"Hey!\"Joshua turned his attention to the man's voice in his ears.These guys\u2026Joshua frowned softly. It was faint, but he could remember them. Or at least what they did to him.They were the Duke\u2019s soldiers, who tormented him as a child. Knights of their status would not dare to harass a child of the Duke, but Joshua was different. His mother was the exclusive maid of the Agnus family, and he was the Duke\u2019s lowly illegitimate child..Joshua was conceived when the Duke forcefully bedded Joshua\u2019s mother.The Duke at least provided them a place to stay. Even if the Duke didn\u2019t care for him like a father should, Joshua was satisfied with his situation.In the Duke\u2019s eyes, Joshua is just the byproduct of his larking; nothing more and nothing less. Knowing this, the soldiers abused Joshua his entire childhood. They derived a strange satisfaction from tormenting someone with noble blood.Particularly the three in front of me\u2026The Duke\u2019s centurions: Rols, Roid, and Gort. He promised to make them pay.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing out here? Didn\u2019t they tell you to muck out the stables?\u201d\u201cDid you forget? This bastard is a dumb mute\u2026 Of course you\u2019re not going to get an answer!\u201d\"Hah!\u201d\u201cRemember the Duchess\u2019s promise? Even if we rape that bitch Lucia and kill that asshole, the Duchess will take care of it.\u201dRols and Roid began giggling as if they were really considering it.\u201cAh, what a shame. I wish the Duke would give us a taste of that Lucia.\u201d\u201cSame.\u201d\u201cCrazy\u2014!\u201dSomething in Joshua snapped when the two men giggled and passed their vulgar jokes and plans back and forth.Lucia.She was Joshua's mother, the poor victim of their despicable desires.I was going to take revenge slowly, without attracting attention.But he could not ignore the people who insulted his dearest mother.Will it work?Joshua closed his eyes and quietly examined his body.The mana technique Joshua learned was unique; he found it in ancient ruins along with Lugia. It was powerful enough to shake the heavens and earth, and he can achieve its optimal state in only a short amount of time.Most importantly, Joshua\u2019s mana technique operated completely differently.Instead of accumulating and drawing mana into the mana hall, located just beneath the stomach, the existing mana is used as-is. It\u2019s not limited to the contents of the man hall, either\u2014instead it draws mana from throughout the body. And then he can concentrate the mana where it is needed and ignite it all at once..As a result, Joshua could skip the process of creating his mana hall which everyone else went through.\u201cEnough chatting! Let\u2019s go beat his ass. If I don't blow off some steam right now, I'll go crazy.\" Gort spoke up for the first time, shaking his head from side to side.\u201cDid you get rejected by your crush again?\u201d\"Shut up! It\u2019s not like that!\u201d Gort growled at Rols and Roid, who burst into laughter, before turning to Joshua.\u201cI\u2019m gonna let loose today. Got it?\u201dDespite the chilling threat in Gort\u2019s voice, Joshua kept his eyes shut and didn\u2019t respond.\u201cDid he pass out standing up? Are you that afraid?\u201d\u201cClosing your eyes, huh? Is that how you want it?\u201dThe three soldiers laughed but Joshua\u2019s concentration never wavered. This was a very crucial moment for beginning his revenge.Just a handful\u2014I need to move just a handful of mana.It takes an average of 5 years for a normal knight with a decent mana technique to construct their mana hall. Considering that, Joshua was twice as slow: before his return, it took him 10 years to move a handful of mana.But when Joshua finally moved a little bit of mana, he steamrolled the other knights.I know how to do it.Joshua\u2019s eyes snapped open and a blue light flashed through them.The sight made Gort hesitate. Joshua, however, focused his gaze on his right fist and slowly manipulated the mana around him.It\u2019s more difficult to infuse mana directly on the body than on an object.However\u2026WhooshA sound resonated from the stable and carried across the grounds.\u201c\u2026\u201dJoshua's expression brightened; finally, a pale blue mana lingered on his fists.I did it!Joshua\u2019s sneer made Gort burn with anger.\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of people, huh? Bastard!\u201dGort\u2019s club shot towards Joshua\u2019s young head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And then it takes another three years to draw mana back out from the mana hall and use it in combat, earning them the title of \u201cC-class Knight\u201d.Therefore, a Knight who can form a mana hall around the age of 15 and manipulate mana would be known as a genius, and was sure to leave their mark in the history of the kingdom. At that age they are sure to master their mana technique by the time they\u2019re 20. It was a very long and tiring process.However\u2026If you look at Joshua right now, he\u2019s undoubtedly a 10 year old boy. He is at least half the age of the idiot centurions in front of him. Imagine the attention he\u2019ll draw when everyone knows that at his young age, not only could he form his mana hall but he could also use it effectively in battle.The Dukedom will be turned upside down.No\u2026 the whole world will be turned upside down.At his age and with his level of mastery, he would be the youngest and greatest genius not only in the Kingdom, but in the entire continent.Last time, I started with nothing. Actually, it\u2019s not a bad thing to gain recognition early.If he was acknowledged as the best at a young age then Kaiser, the fox, would surely bow before him.He would find Joshua because he was more focused on recruiting outstanding people more than anyone else. He was sure that Kaiser would be the same as before.I was thinking about a lot of things, but only a moment has passed. A hundred thoughts in a fleeting breath.Gort\u2019s club was about to smash into his nose. However, Joshua\u2019s quick reflexes let him dodge the fist with flawless posture and short, concise movements, causing the club to miss by a hair\u2019s breadth.\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207eIt was a simple action, but its speed and power were anything but.Joshua took a single step to the side, avoiding the punch, and clenched his right fist.Whump!Gort\u2019s body made a sound like ripping leather when Joshua\u2019s fist struck home.\u201cEu\u2014!\u201dHe couldn't even manage a groan and collapsed to the ground, eyes rolling back into his skull.\u201cWhat?\u201dRols\u2019s eyes went wide with bewilderment. Gort stood with his back facing little Joshua, obscuring what happened behind him.After a moment, Gort\u2019s unconscious body fell to the ground with a thud. The next moment, his silent whimper of defeat faded along with his consciousness.\u201cThis bastard!\u201dRoid, who was more hot-tempered than Rols, drew his sword.It made a resounding Chaang! as he unsheathed it. It was a common longsword that could easily be found on the street. Joshua noticed the rust speckling the sword here and there but it was plenty sharp.This is dangerous.Immediately after using the technique, Joshua felt something strange inside his body. He could feel something lumpy and unpleasant in the pit of his stomach which he wasn\u2019t familiar with.Just one more time.His head was ringing, but he didn\u2019t pay it any mind.If I defeat Roid, the probability of Rols attacking me is very low\u2026 since he\u2019s the most cautious of the three.\u201cLook here!\u201dRoid approached him and swung his longsword at Joshua\u2019s neck.Whik!The longsword swung right over Joshua\u2019s face with a ripping metal sound. Joshua neatly avoided it by leaning back.Right now, he had the body of an untrained child, but he knew that as he gets older his muscles will harden and his flexibility will be improved.He bounced back up like a spring, and was greeted by Roid\u2019s surprised bunny eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhoosh!It was definitely weaker than before, but clear mana appeared on Joshua's fist once again.It was so close that Roid saw it too.\u201cNo. Mana \u4e00!\u201d Roid muttered in astonishment.CrackIt was not the sound of tearing leather like before, but a light thump sound.\u201cFinished.\u201dDump.Roid fell to the floor after being hit with a 100-point uppercut, shattering his jaw. Rols saw the situation unfold and gasped in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d Rols spat a cuss and backed away.Am I seeing this for real? The mute idiot is speaking, and he pummeled my friends with his tiny fist!It was too much to be a coincidence. Now, it\u2019s safe to say that the peasant asshole had been hiding his skills for a long time now.Well\u2026While Rols\u2019s brain was in turmoil, Joshua staggered.Obviously something was wrong.Such pain from using only this much mana!A cold sweat trickled down his temple. He knew he couldn\u2019t afford to show his weakness now. He needed to cement his victory. And he was sure that he would be.Rols was as quick-witted as he was cautious. He was a person who had risen to the rank of centurion using his eyes rather than his skills. However, in Joshua\u2019s current state, even someone of Rols\u2019s level was dangerous given his rapidly fading consciousness..Joshua desperately straightened his unsteady body.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d For a moment, Rols was stunned.\u201cYou, you, you\u2026 ! Spoke... Did you always know how?\u201d Rols\u2019s looked wide enough to pop out of his skull at any moment.\u201cFrom this moment on, anyone \u2013 including you centurions \u2013 who insults my mother \u4e00\u201dThe more Joshua's youthful voice continued, the faster Rols retreated.\u201c\u4e00 I will never let go.\u201dBlue flame flashed between Joshua's two eyes as he finished speaking.\u201cAh ah ah ah ah!\u201d Startled, Rolls screamed and turned away. His many sins rattled his head as he ran.Joshua was dangerous. The child was no longer the dumb asshole he knew: he was a predator.The Battle of Kraden Plains was one of the worst battles I ever experienced. That kid felt like one of the first nine stars of the Empire I saw there.\u201cHe\u2019s a monster!\u201dRols did his best to flee, kicking up a cloud of dust behind him.Joshua stared at his silhouette until it disappeared.Thump.With a small noise, Joshua's small body collapsed.Oh, shit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the center of an expansive, almost forest-like garden, you would find the great mansion of the Agnus family, which would not lose to any other palace in the Empire.This place was one of the nine stars of the continent.And the residence of Duke Aden von Agnus.Duke Agnus's mansion.Even in the early morning, the whole mansion was rowdy. Bizarre rumors had begun to spread among the Duke\u2019s soldiers.In a corner by the door, three servants chattered as they worked.\u201cDid you hear what I said? How the dumb asshole in the stable pounded three centurions into rice cakes?\u201d (TL Note - The process of making rice cakes has created some interesting (and racy) idioms. A hammer was traditionally used to beat the rice into a chewy consistency. So if a team gets beaten badly in a sports game or if someone gets very drunk they are said to 'become rice cake'.)Brown was taken aback by the words of Paul, his colleague in the kitchen.\"Shh! Watch your mouth!\u201d\u201cWhat, why?\u201dPaul tilted his head at Brown's intense reaction. Brown peered pensively at their surroundings and lowered his voice as much as he could.\u201cI heard\u2026 rumors... that he\u2019s not dumb.\"\u201cWhat?\u201dThis time, Paul was astonished. Although that dumbass was ignored even by mere servants, he was still a son of the Duke. If, one day, the child decided to out them to the Duke...Paul gulped, but his throat was bone-dry.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it either.\u201dPaul patted his chest. The atmosphere became tense.\u201cBy the way, does the Duke know about these rumors?\u201d\"Right?\"Brown and Paul eye each other apprehensively.\u201cIf the rumors are true, then that dumb\u2014er, the young master made three of the Duke's centurion bit the dust!\" Bob exclaimed with a slight tremble in his voice. The other two stared blankly at him.\u201cYes, what of it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dLooking at the two people who still looked at him like he was speaking gibberish, Bob continued.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure, but I heard that the Young Master is only ten years old!\u201d\"What?\" The two men widened their eyes when they understood Bob\u2019s point.\u201cReally? Then he\u2019s four years younger than Master Babel, and he\u2019s not that much older than Miss Arsha,\u201d said Paul, with a bewildered expression.Arsha von Agnus was the young daughter of the Agnus family. She just recently turned six and dominated the entire Dukedom with her cuteness. The Young Lady was just beginning to read textbooks, yet her similarly-aged brother is already beating people up.The two guys looked at Paul. It was all coming together, but it wasn\u2019t looking good for the people who mistreated Joshua.\u201cThen\u2026 you mean a ten year old child beat up the Duke\u2019s centurions, alone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, if the rumors are indeed true.\u201d Bob nodded softly at Brown's words.\"My God\u2026\u201d Seeing Brown's wide open mouth, Paul burst out laughing.\u201cBrown, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t get married. Because you\u2019re so naive.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dPaul waved flippantly at the furious Brown and continued.\u201cRumors get exaggerated. Would it make any sense for a dumbass child to beat down three centurions with his bare hands?\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d It was strange, now that he thought about it.\u201cHah, rumors are just rumors. The boy must\u2019ve done something; you know, maybe he\u2019s tired of getting bullied and asked the centurions to spread the rumor around.\u201d\u201cBut why would the centurions agree to such a request?\u201d\u201cProbably because they want his mother\u2026 You know, that Lucia girl has a pretty face and a great body.\u201dBrown nodded in agreement. It was well known that the maid Lucia was strikingly beautiful, even more so than the Duchess of Agnus.\u201cI would die satisfied if I ever slept with that Lucia\u2026 Such a pity that even men like the centurions can only look. How am I to compete?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a man with children\u2026! Go sleep with your wife!\u201d Brown spat. The other men were startled but immediately regained their composure.\u201cWhat is it, Brown? Did you also have feelings for Lucia?\u201d\u201cT-too noisy!\u201dHahahahahahahah!Paul couldn't help but burst out laughing.\u201cYou can\u2019t eat the same thing every day. Sometimes, a man needs to try something different to reset his platter. Not to mention, this dish is more appetizing.\u201d Paul stopped laughing and licked his lips lustfully.Brown couldn\u2019t help but worry.Then Bob, who had been silent until now, opened his mouth.\"However\u2026 What if the rumors are true\u2026? I wonder if the Duke would even bring that asshole into the mansion?\u201d\u201cHe probably won\u2019t. Since the family succession will be ruined if a competitor suddenly showed up,\u201d Brown answered honestly.\u201cPuhahahaha! Hey, Bob, are you thinking like Brown too? Why are you like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut Bob looked at him with a closed mouth and solemn eyes. Paul\u2019s laughter tapered off and he shrugged at his own unanswered question.\u201cEven if the rumors were true, he could never defeat Master Babel. You get that, right?\"\u201cRight, since Master Babel can wield mana.\u201dBrown turned to Paul.\u201cMaster Babel is fourteen this year\u2026 I heard that the Grand Duke only became a \u201cMaster\u201d at the age of sixteen\u2026 In other words, Master Babel is a genius surpassing even the Grand Duke. Do you think the other Young Master could defeat Master Babel?\u201dPaul shook his head.\u201cThat sounds crazy.\u201d And then Paul turned away.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about useless assholes and discuss something useful \u2013 like all the ways we could enjoy Lucia\u2019s sweet body \u4e00\u201dThey carelessly chattered away instead of working and giggled like little girls while they unveiled their wildest fantasies.Before Paul could boast about his plans to violate Lucia, he spotted a certain someone. Brown and Bob followed Paul\u2019s gaze and stiffened in shock.The main topic of the rumors was there. The boy with deep blue hair and eyes like an abyss. Gone was the scruffy, hunched figure he was known for. The dignity he exuded with his upright posture was reminiscent of a proud Knight striding into battle.\u201cUh, since when \u4e00\u201d Paul stuttered.\u201cI need you to tell the Duke something.\u201d Joshua stared straight at Paul and spoke calmly.\u201c\u2026!\u201dTheir eyes popped wide open at the sound of his voice. It confirmed the rumors and showed them so much more.Joshua returned their stares with a steely gaze.It\u2019s advantageous to hide your abilities as much as possible, because I know the consequences of indiscretion from my previous life...However\u2026When you show it, you go big or go home. His power is meaningless if he doesn\u2019t use it to protect the person he loves most.And so he spoke with utmost confidence:\u201cTell the Duke that Joshua von Agnus is here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was Count Valderas den Chiffon; he commanded the Red Knights, one of the three major arms of Duke Agnus\u2019s forces.Duke Agnus\u2019s hair was dark \u2013 nearly black \u2013 blue, but his eyes were an icy pale blue. The stubborn set of his jaw bore a certain resemblance to that boy, Joshua.Arden von Agnus.One of only five Masters in the vast Avalon Empire.One of the Nine Stars, said to be the mightiest individuals on the continent.A monster on the battlefield, wielding a greatsword nearly two meters long.He was known as \u201cThe Giant\u201d.\u201cYou said your name was Rols?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace!\u201dRols lifted his head from where he was prostrated on the floor.The Duke spoke quietly.\u201cWhat unit do you belong to?\u201d\u201cThe 29th Battalion!\u201d\u201cThe 29th Battalion\u2026 is commanded by Griezmann?\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d Chiffon answered this time.Duke Aden\u2019s standing army numbered an impressive 40,000 men. The army was divided into 40 battalions, each commanded by a general. Each general had ten centurions, and each centurion commanded ten sergeants.\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207eDuke Agnus examined Rols\u2019s armor. It was good armor, stitched from the tough skins of black tribe orcs from the northern plains.However, his armor looked as if it had been blasted apart by a mage\u2019s fireball.\u201cYou mean to tell me Joshua did this?\u201d The Duke\u2019s words were soft and deep.Chiffon smirked at the trembling soldier.\u201cThink carefully before you answer. If you lie even a little\u2026\u201dRols choked and quivered on the ground. It wasn\u2019t that he wanted to lie, the story was just too absurd to believe.\u201cI\u2019m not lying, Duke!\u201d\u201cChiffon, did you examine the armor?\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201dThe hole in the armor was somehow twisted at the edges.\u201cHow old will Joshua be this year?\u201d Duke Agnus asked Chiffon.\u201cHe is five years younger than Master Babel, so Joshua should be roughly nine right now.\u201d\u201cSo a nine year old boy did this to black orc\u2019s skin?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cWith his bare hands, at that.\u201d Chiffon\u2019s cold eyes dared Rols to speak up. The knight was equally unconvinced.If Chiffon was asked to break leather of that kind, he couldn\u2019t confidently say he could. He didn\u2019t know if he could even rupture it without mana.\u201cWell, if he could use mana\u2026 it might be possible.\u201d\u201cBut how could that child\u2014\u201d\u201cYour Grace! There has never been a single case of someone using mana at the age of nine. Not in the Empire, not anywhere!\u201d Chiffon shook his head confidently. \u201cEven if someone had pulled it off at some point in history, it could just as well be a B-Class knight. They can infuse mana into their hands, too.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cSo there\u2019s no reason to believe that Joshua did this, given he\u2019s only nine years old.\u201dDuke Agnus remained silent and unmoving.\u201cPerhaps, Your Grace, this is a coverup for whatever shady business this soldier was up to.\u201d\u201c...!\u201d\u201cIf Your Grace allows it, I will take this guy out and correct the soldiers\u2019 discipline.\u201d The knight bowed his head and waited silently for the Duke\u2019s answer.\u201cI never lied! What I said was completely the truth! Duke, please save me.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Chiffon roared. His hand dropped to the hilt of his sword.He took Duke Agnus\u2019s continued silence as affirmation and slowly approached Rols.\u201cDuke! Duke!\u201d Rols\u2019s face turned pale as he desperately retreated from Chiffon.\u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d\u201cDuke?\u201d Chiffon stopped.\u201cThis problem will only be solved when I\u2019ve met with the other side of the issue.\u201d The Duke spoke with a resounding authority, ignoring the shivering Rols.\u201c...It was about time, anyway.\u201d He muttered sadly. \u201cI will see him on my own.\u201dChiffon\u2019s eyes widened.The Duke himself, taking interest in the concubine\u2019s son! Even Master Babel, the treasure of the Agnus family, doesn\u2019t get this kind of treatment.\u201cWhere did you say Joshua was?\u201d\u201cI was told he had just entered the mansion. He may be in the first floor waiting room.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Duke Agnus stood and strode slowly to the door. Chiffon spared a glance at Rols before quickly following his lord.Thud!The door shut behind them, leaving Rols slumped on the cold floor sobbing. His thin pants were beginning to stain with a fishy yellow liquid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was also the only legitimate son of the Duke.His reputation made him seem even more attractive, considering he became a C-Class Knight at the young age of 14.\u201cWhy is that garbage here?\u201d Babel rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was hallucinating. On the first floor of the mansion stood a small boy that resembled his father.\u201cJoshua\u2014!\u201d he grunted. Ignoring his growing irritation, he slowly approached Joshua. As the distance closed, his sharp eyes shone and his lips curled into a smirk.\u201cHey!\u201dJoshua stared blankly at the wall, making the blond boy seethe in anger.\u201cHow dare you ignore me!\u201d Babel raised his fist at Joshua\u2019s back like a madman. Joshua, however, was oblivious to the incoming danger.From the moment Joshua was born, Babel despised him. At best, he considered Joshua the byproduct of his father\u2019s idle lust. It infuriated him that Joshua resembled his idol, the Duke.\u201cLet\u2019s see how long you can keep that act up.\u201dWhik!Babel\u2019s fists snapped forward with an audible boom. His speed was unbelievable for a child of his age\u2014the sound alone was proof enough of his prowess.However\u2026Whoosh!What happened next was even harder to believe.As soon as Joshua entered the mansion, his eyes were glued to the wall. Above the stairs was a wall of portraits. On it was a portrait of someone Joshua could never forget: a middle-aged man with dazzling blond hair, rare golden eyes, and a smile as bright as his hair, rendered on luxurious canvas.Kaiser von Britten.Joshua spat the words like rotten food.They looked exactly the same, but he knew this portrait was not of Kaiser. This was the current emperor of Avalon.Rationale, however, could not suppress the anger swelling in Joshua\u2019s stomach.I feel like I\u2019ll go crazy if I don\u2019t release this anger right now. If only I hadn\u2019t seen that face\u2026Whik!Just then, he felt a presence approaching from behind. Instinct kicked in and he sharply avoided the strike.Thwack!\u201c...!\u201dA small fist was caught in his hand. The other boy stared wide-eyed at the unexpected sight.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d Babel\u2019s fist was crushed in Joshua\u2019s hand, drawing a pained groan. Joshua looked at the fist in front of him and squeezed it tighter. The boy made a sound like a dying cat.Who was this boy? Joshua couldn\u2019t be bothered to recall. He was just grateful to have someone to vent his anger on.Crack.Babel broke into a cold sweat.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Babel swore. Joshua\u2019s grip on his fist was nowhere near weak or pleasant.Of course, he had heard the rumors.Of course, he had not believed it at the time.A kid who only shovels horse dung knocked down three of the Duke\u2019s elite centurions?\u00a0It would be more plausible for a dragon to mate with an orc.And yet\u2026Could it really be true?\u00a0Babel clenched his teeth. His instincts told him to draw mana from his hall into his fist.\u201cStop!\u201d From the top of the stairs, a shout resounded across the house.\u201cAh! Father!\u201d Startled, Babel turned towards the speaker. It was his father and the lord of the Dukedom, Aden von Agnus.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Duke Agnus asked, eyes cold as he slowly descended the stairs. Babel, realizing his fists were already free from Joshua\u2019s death grip, quickly collected himself.\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201dPlace your right fist over your left breast, and, keeping your right leg straight, kneel with your left leg.Babel recited a knight\u2019s standard greeting for the umpteenth time in his head. The Duke only nodded slightly without replying.Ah.\u00a0Chiffon, at the Duke\u2019s heels, admired the young master. It was a knight\u2019s pride and honor to maintain a dignified appearance regardless of the circumstances.\u201cI asked what you were doing.\u201d Duke Agnus glanced at Joshua, who did not move, before addressing Babel again.\u201cWe were just greeting each other.\u201d\u201cGreeting?\u201d Duke Agnus frowned.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I saw him, so I went to greet him, Your Grace.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cOne handshake is all I needed.\u201dDuke Agnus looked at Joshua.\u201c...\u201d Joshua nodded silently.Chiffon glared scornfully at him.He dares respond with just a nod to the Grand Duke? Is he insane?\u00a0Chiffon\u2019s hand reached for the hilt of his sword, awaiting the order to punish the insolent child. However, the order never came.Instead, the Duke gestured for him to hold.\u201cYour eyes\u2026 are full of poison,\u201d Duke Agnus murmured in a low voice.To the Duke, seeing Joshua\u2019s face was like looking into a mirror. However, Joshua\u2019s face was awash with a frightening mixture of anger, resentment, and suffering.Damn it\u2026\u00a0Joshua muttered inwardly and chewed his lip. This should not be happening. Joshua had a cold personality and an iron-fisted mentality, yet the portrait broke his composure.And the Duke of Agnus he remembered would never suffer a display of hostility.Even his own kin\u2026Then Duke Agnus broke the silence.\u201cCome closer.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cI must verify it myself. Is it true that you used mana?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014!\u201d Babel\u2019s eyes widened.Mana? This lowly bastard? That\u2019s impossible! He\u2019s just the son of a servant and he\u2019s much younger than me!\u201cCome closer.\u201dIf the Duke hadn\u2019t spoken again, Babel would have punched Joshua in the face.\u201cDuke, what are you\u2014?\u201dDuke Agnus\u2019s heavy gaze shut Chiffon\u2019s mouth immediately.\u201cCome.\u201dJoshua chewed his lip. Duke Agnus was one of the few Masters in the entirety of the Empire. Even more, he was one of the Nine Stars, the strongest people in the continent.If he were to discover an abnormality in my body\u2026Sussuk!While Joshua was drowning in his doubts, Duke Agnus appeared before Joshua in the blink of an eye. His movement was eerily silent.Bump!When the Duke approached and snatched his wrist, Joshua could do nothing but sweat.\u201cThis\u2014!\u201d The Duke\u2019s normally emotionless face twisted. A moment, a second, a minute passed and his face remained colored with astonishment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joshua\u2019s face, however, was wracked with worry.Damn it,\u00a0Joshua thought to himself. He didn\u2019t bother worrying about the Duke\u2019s grip on his wrists, because there wasn\u2019t a single thing he could do about it.Right now I\u2019m not Joshua Sanders, the strongest Spear Knight of all time; I\u2019m only Joshua von Agnus, the nine year old boy.So there wouldn\u2019t be anything of interest about his body.But when the Duke\u2019s eyes popped out of their sockets, it felt like Joshua had been dunked in ice water. If Duke Agnus sensed something he shouldn\u2019t have, all his plans would be thrown into chaos.What should I do?\u00a0A cold sweat trickled down Joshua\u2019s back.Duke Agnus mulled over it with his eyes closed for a long moment before speaking.\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Chiffon asked blankly.\u201cMana\u2026 none.\u201dBabel smirked as if to say \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Chiffon burst into laughter.\u201cDuke, of course\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the mana hall.\u201d Duke Agnus quietly shook his head. \u201cHmm. It does feel different.\u201dChiffon\u2019s eyes widened.Mana.Mana is in every living creature in the world, whether a knight or a wizard. It was in the general populace, and even inside base creatures.Mana is a driving force of life.The total absence of mana is like black magic. That\u2019s why Duke Agnus was so intrigued when he examined Joshua\u2019s body.\u201cWhat is this? Where the mana hall should be, there\u2019s something\u2026 foul, sticky, and lumpy.\u201dJoshua had controlled his expression until now, but his eyes popped wide open.No!Alarms rang in his head.He had not paid much attention to the lack of mana in his body, because his mana technique, at a certain level, would assimilate his internal mana with the natural mana in the environment.He knew he could still use mana. But what the Duke was talking about might be connected to his \u201cregression\u201d.\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Chiffon picked his words carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories of children born without mana.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus swallowed stiffly.There were cases of children being born without an ounce of mana \u2013 about 1 in 100,000 \u2013 known as \u201ccongenital mana disorder\u201d. It was said to be a curse from God, and would kill the child before they reached eighteen. There were no exceptions.Given its rarity, Duke Agnus knew only what he had read.But it doesn\u2019t seem to be a disability.\u00a0Duke Agnus murmured inwardly. He locked eyes with Joshua, making him jump.Duke Agnus stood with a smile.\u201cDuke?\u201d Chiffon\u2019s worried voice pulled him out of his musings.\u201cFor now\u2026\u201d\u201c...Let\u2019s watch.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d Chiffon blurted.\u201cIf the child really has congenital mana disorder, then the rumors must be false.\u201d Duke Agnus shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to behead those three right now. A centurion belongs to the estate. They should act like it.\u201d\u201cI apologize for my moment of indiscretion.\u201d Chiffon dropped to a knee. The Duke nodded in acknowledgement, then turned his head to Joshua.\u201cYou\u2026 prepare a room for him to stay in.\u201d\u201cDuke?\u201d Babel jolted.\u201cIs there a problem, Babel?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Babel bit his lips when Duke Agnus\u2019s cold gaze fell on him. \u201cThere is none.\u201d\u201cYou can tell Joshua about living in the mansion.\u201dBabel took a minute to compose himself.\u201cYes.\u201d He replied, weakly.\u201cChiffon.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke!\u201d\u201cStarting tomorrow, teach Joshua the basic knight\u2019s training. If he has the talent, you can teach him the Red Knights\u2019 mana techniques.\u201d\u201cYes? But, Duke, master Joshua is obviously\u2014!\u201d Chiffon choked on the end of his sentence. He was afraid to say that Joshua might have congenital mana disorder.\u201cThere is plenty of time. It doesn\u2019t have to be done quickly. It would be even better if it turned out he\u2019s not suffering from that curse.\u201d\u201c\u2014I obey, Duke.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus looked at Joshua strangely. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for a year.\u201d\u201cIf something changes in you then\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s mouth hung open as if he was about to say something, but he turned away. \u201c\u2014I look forward to returning from Arcadia next year.\u201d\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207e\u201cChiffon, remain here.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d He answered vigorously.All three watched the Duke\u2019s figure disappear.\u201cYou should stay here for a while.\u201dJoshua didn\u2019t respond.Were the rumors true?\u00a0Chiffon frowned.\u00a0I heard he lived in a stabled ever since they were thrown out of the mansion. This room is more spacious and better furnished than a peasant\u2019s entire home.The boy remained expressionless. Chiffon sighed in frustration.\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d Chiffon knew the boy was the child of a mere maid, so he left without further decorum.Thud!The door shut. Joshua sighed.Whump.Joshua let his body melt into the bedsheets.\u201cI could fall asleep right now...\u201d Joshua mumbled, fighting his heavy eyelids.Duke Agnus was probably referring to when he would return to the capital city of Avalon, the Imperial Castle Arcadia.Duke Agnus spent most of his time there. He had probably returned to the Agnus estate for recreation, though he was the type of person who didn\u2019t understand how to rest.You look forward to seeing me in a year.\u00a0Did the Duke know something Johsua didn\u2019t? Whatever it was, it couldn\u2019t be good. The fact that anyone knew his hidden cards is a risk, because it had been his leash in the past.I can\u2019t come up with anything right now.\u00a0Joshua shook off his restlessness.\u201cBabel von Agnus\u2026\u201d Joshua chuckled. Babel\u2019s last words were still lingering in his head.\u201cWatch your step! I\u2019ll cut your limbs off if you\u2019re trying to fool everyone. Same for your maid mother too\u2026\u201dJoshua sighed.Strange things were happening inside his body right now and he had a feeling he could solve it.\u201cI need to restore my strength\u2026 and for that\u2014\u201dHaving just entered the Duke\u2019s lair, Joshua knew he needed to stay low-key and avoid suspicion. That\u2019s why he\u2019d avoided seeing his mother, whom he missed so much.After midnight, I\u2019ll go look for you.\u00a0In the dim setting sun, Joshua\u2019s eyes glittered brightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He exhaled deeply and resolved to exit the mansion.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Joshua let out a short groan as he walked. The eerie lump where his mana hall should be was acting up. The pain was becoming more restrictive every minute.The problem is the energy inside the lump, a subtle but familiar mixture.Divine power, magic, and\u2014\u201cHeurk\u2014!\u201d Joshua snapped and coughed up blood. On the bright side, it was clean, bright blood rather than the foul blood from when he died.\u201cUgh\u2014\u201d For some reason, the energies that killed him had come back in time with him. They clawed at each other, engulfing Joshua in a terrible, shuddering pain.At first, Joshua thought he had just lost his strength when he\u2019d travelled to the past.But that\u2019s not it.\u00a0He could still feel the energy working inside him.After all, this was Joshua, the Undefeated Spear Knight of the Avalon Empire. Joshua was sometimes called the \u201cabsolute man\u201d and considered the most talented person alive. He was renowned all across Igrant.His senses told him that something was suppressing the power of the clashing energies\u2026\u201cLugia.\u201d Joshua frowned.His dear friend, Lugia. Somehow, Lugia\u2019s enormous latent power was restraining the conflicting energy inside him. Perhaps Lugia would provide the solution to his bizarre condition.The pain subsided, and Joshua hurried onwards.\u201cIf I could make all three energies my own\u2026\u201d Even Joshua knew it was crazy. Magic and Divine power were antithetical. Not a single person, ever, had wielded both at the same time.\u201cA little North of the stable. Next to the house-sized rock.\u201d Joshua mumbled to himself. Across the vast holdings of Duke Agnus, only Joshua knew this secret.Joshua was getting close. He was about to pass the stable when\u2026\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!\u201d A high-pitched scream pierced his ears.Joshua\u2019s eyes flew open.\u201cThis voice!\u201d It had been a long time, and it was only a scream, but Joshua could never forget this voice. His heart \u2013 and his feet \u2013 raced violently.A trembling woman in her late twenties was surrounded by three men. She was dressed shabbily, but her singular beauty shone through. Her eyes were a sparking emerald and her hair was the blue of a clam sea. Though her face was marred with suffering and shadowed by anxiety, she was beautiful enough to make anyone look twice.It was Joshua\u2019s mother, Lucia.Lucia was in a very difficult situation.\u201cLet me go! Why are you doing this to me?\u201d The bound woman spoke with a tremulous voice.\u201cHehe. Lucia, let\u2019s not do this when we know each other\u2019s situation.\u201d The man clutching Lucia\u2019s wrists, Gort, sported a disgusting smile.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt must be ten years since the Duke embraced you, right? Don\u2019t you somewhere to blow off steam, while you\u2019re at your prime?\u201d Gort gestured at Lucia\u2019s body.\u201cWell, even if you don\u2019t need it, we do. We have to take care of our needs from time to time, too.\u201d Roid smiled.\u201cThen\u2014! You think the Duke will ignore this?\u201d\u201cWhat? You think the Duke will come running to save you?\u201d Lucia could not refute Gort. \u201cYou\u2019re just a lowly maid\u2026 Rather, you should consider it an honor to serve the Duke\u2019s centurions.\u201d\u201cHehe. Can you believe this guy? Don\u2019t worry. Today I\u2019ll give you a taste of paradise,\u201d Roid teased.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about yelling. Well, even if you did, no one would hear.\u201d\u201cYou know we\u2019re responsible for this area, don\u2019t you?\u201dLucia could only tremble.\u201cBut\u2026 is this really okay?\u201d Unlike the other two, Rols stepped back and muttered nervously.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this fool, huh?\u201d Gort scratched his head and laughed at his comrade.\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014 If that boy\u2014 Oh God, if he shows up!\u201d\u201cFuck! Then you take care of it!\u201d Roid spat. His eyes hadn\u2019t left Lucia\u2019s body. \u201cWe came here to teach that bastard a lesson, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cShut it! If you blabber about that bastard\u2019s punches again, I\u2019ll beat you down before he can!\u201dRols shut his mouth.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even make sense. Three centurions felled in one shot by a peasant child of less than ten years. He cleans horse manure!\u201d They muttered to themself out of Lucia\u2019s hearing.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Maybe he was possessed by a demon.\u201d Roid nodded at Gort\u2019s words. Rols flew into a rage.\u201cBut obviously I\u2014!\u201d\u201cI told you to shut it!\u201d Gort shouted.

Where the hell is my child!\u201d Lucia had been frozen stiff, but shouted and screamed when she heard Joshua\u2019s name.Gort scowled, but then had an idea and smirked. He pointed to the lone tree next to the stable.\u201cI beat him up and hung him from that tree.\u201d Gort let out a grim chuckle, wondering what Lucia was thinking now.Lucia slumped. The shock of what she heard drained her energy in an instant.\u201cI can\u2019t take it any longer.\u201d Gort licked his lips and he leered at Lucia.\u201cDon\u2019t do this, please\u2014\u201d Lucia desperately retreated.\u201cHey Gort, can we start now? I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d Roid tugged at his pants and approached Lucia.\u201cBut what if that guy shows up while you\u2019re doing it?\u201d\u201cWe only need one person to deal with him.\u201d Gort laughed.\u201cHah!\u201d Roid burst out laughing.\u201cLet\u2019s start right away.\u201d Gort let out a dark chuckle. When he reached Lucia, she bit his hand.\u201cOuch! This bitch!\u201d Gort slapped Lucia. Her screams sounded in succession, and her slender body sank to the ground.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Gort clicked his tongue as he examined the maid.\u201cHey, I think this is too harsh\u2014\u201d Rols said.\u201cThis Duchess will take care of it, you coward.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, just leave.\u201d Seeing Rols, shut his mouth, Gort grinned. \u201cWell then.\u201d He approached Lucia\u2019s unconscious body.Clack. Clack. Clack.The sound of unfamiliar footsteps echoed around them, amplified by the dark.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Gort\u2019s head snapped towards the sound.\u201cYou\u2014!\u201dA boy approached from between Rols and Roid.

In his past life, she contracted a terrible chronic disease and died, alone and despairing, when he was 14 years old. Joshua was frustrated by his powerlessness and cried for a long, long time.For Joshua, his mother was his only refuge from the constant bullying he received. It was only when she passed away that Joshua realized how much she meant to him. With his world crumbling around him, Joshua swore off personal attachments unless he had the strength to protect them.But this time, even at the tender age of nine, Joshua had the power to protect his beloved mother.Joshua cast his gaze across the ground. He found a rake used to clean horse manure and kicked it into his hand with a smile.\u201c\u2014g-go!\u201d Rols stuttered. He\u2019d been trembling from the moment he saw Joshua.\u201c...What?\u201d\u201cWe should go. That kid isn\u2019t the one we know anymore!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, you bastard?\u201d Gort glared at the small boy. Roid just shook his head. Only Rols, who had witnessed everything, was nervous.\u201cGet out of the way. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Gort got up and dusted off his pants.\u201cDon\u2019t work yourself too hard, Gort. Rols\u2026 you crybaby.\u201d Rols said with a relaxed expression.\u201cCome on then. I woulda been worried if you didn\u2019t show up.\u201d Gort mocked Joshua like a small animal. Gort burst into laughter when he saw Joshua remain silent like the mute he was.He looks so pathetic, Roid thought.\u201cWell, whatever.\u201d Gort shrugged. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s mother gets raped right in front of them, even a mute will open their mouth.\u201d At that, Roid couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and his giggles turned into full-blown laughter.\u201cWhatcha you gonna do about it?\u201d Roid mocked. Joshua eyed his mother before finally speaking out.\u201cCome out!\u201d The three centurions jumped.He really can talk. Were the rumors true?\u00a0Gort mused blankly.\u201cThis oughta be good.\u201d Roid laughed, but Rols was still shaking.\u201cHuh, yeah. If you insist.\u201d Gort unsheathed his sword and pointed it at Joshua.This kind of sword was standard-issue, but this was the Agnus estate; they provided the highest quality materials and weapons to knights of all levels. It was in decent shape, with a few spots of rust here and there, but it was as sharp as the day it was forged. Gort licked his lips as he examined the sheen offhis sword.\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\u201cI said:\u00a0come out.\u201d Gort had been edging towards Joshua, but he felt something was off and halted. Joshua was looking in his direction, but not directly at Gort.\u201cWhat are you going on abou\u2014\u201d\u201cHow did you notice?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Gort screamed, and the three thugs whirled around. What they saw astonished them.There was a young man with brown hair and tan eyes \u2013 an ordinary appearance you could see anywhere on the street, but his clothes told a different story. There was a distinctive red cross embossed on his leather armor. This mark, considering its origins, was instantly recognizable to anyone: it was the insignia of Duke Agnus\u2019s Red Knights.Even a knight was as far from a soldier of this caliber as a commoner was from nobility. The difference was like Heaven and Earth.\u201cI greet the Red Knight!\u201d The centurions snapped to attention at once.Place your right fist over your left breast and bow your head deeply.\u00a0This greeting was clearly different from how they would greet the duke. No one else was treated as he was, not even their commanders.Kneel to no one except the master.\u00a0The unspoken rule of Duke Agnus.The Red Knight, Cain, met Joshua\u2019s cold eyes. He couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment.Is this really the dumb kid they were talking about?\u00a0He could see Joshua\u2019s small, fragile body was nothing like Cain\u2019s, yet he seemed to emanate a strange feeling of intimidation from his tiny form.What is this?\u00a0Cain tried to swallow, but his throat ran dry. He knew of only one person with this kind of presence: the Duke.\u201cI have a question.\u201d When Joshua spoke, Cain\u2019s mind went blank. He\u2019d been assigned to monitor the boy by Chiffon, but, when the boy addressed him, all of that disappeared. Only the instinctive desire to answer remained.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cA soldier attempted to sully the Duke\u2019s mistress\u2026 According to the Duke\u2019s military regulations, how should we handle this case?\u201dA mere maid\u2014!\u00a0The words remained stuck in Cain\u2019s throat. He was too afraid to utter them when faced with the boy\u2019s intimidating aura.Cain bit his lip. For a moment, he met Joshua\u2019s eyes. He had no words for what he felt then. All he could do was obey.\u201c\u2014Immediate execution.\u201d\u201cYou know what to do.\u201d Joshua tossed his rake aside.Cain drew his sword, and the three centurions prostrated themselves in unison.\u201cSpare me! I will never consider such nonsense again! Please!\u201d Cain glanced from them to Joshua, but Joshua\u2019s eyes were unwavering and merciless.He swung.An unnerving scream split the silence, echoing across the Duke\u2019s estate.Joshua only sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From only a single swing Joshua could tell that Cain had achieved a great understanding of the sword.The Red Knight looked to be in his 20s. If he was sent to monitor Joshua, there was a high probability that he was the youngest and lowest ranking in the troop.But his skills\u2026Even though the Red Knights were one of the three strongest units in the Duke\u2019s army, it was the weakest of the three.With that in consideration, this young knight is\u2026\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dCain glared down at the three centurions, his chilly eyes freezing the tense atmosphere.Roid and Gort were already dead.He rounded on Rols.\u201cHey!\u201d Gort\u2019s and Roid\u2019s blood dripped off Cain\u2019s sword. \u201cI\u2014 please! Forgive me just\u2014 just this once\u2026!\u201dCain looked unshaken even after cutting down two centurions. Instead, he approached Rols with a singularly indifferent expression.\u201cPlease! Forgive me!\u201d Cain raised his sword as if he hadn\u2019t heard.\u201cStop.\u201d Cain halted.Joshua approached slowly under the dim moonlight.\u201c...There is only one punishment for the crime of insulting the Duke\u2019s woman: immediate execution.\u201d Cain had yet to lower his sword. As expected, even an untitled knight knew the rules so well. Cain stared at Joshua for a moment before turning back to Rols.\u201cYoung Master! Please save me! I swear\u2014 I swear my eternal loyalty if you save me!\u201d Rols begged and scraped at Joshua\u2019s feet.\u201cShut up!\u201d Cain clenched his sword tight enough to make his veins pop.\u201cFrom that insignia, it looks like you\u2019re a member of the Red Knights. What is your name?\u201d Cain\u2019s grip loosened when Joshua addressed him.\u201cMy name is Cain.\u201d\u201cSir Cain. Before you continue, I have one question.\u201dCain blinked at him. Joshua stared straight into his eyes and said,\u201cWho is your master?\u201dCain paused for a second before answering.\u201cMy master is Duke Agnus.\u201d His chest puffed with pride.\u201cThen one more question: Who am I?\u201dA cold gust blew across them, as if even the air could feel the tension.Cain\u2019s eyes widened with understanding.\u00a0Obey me.\u201cSheath your sword.\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice was frigid.\u201c...I obey.\u201d Eventually, Cain slid his sword back into its scabbard with a sigh. Metal hissed against leather, and the blade disappeared from sight. Rols shouted in jubilation,\u201cThank you Young Master Joshua! I will be forever loyal\u2014!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need this loyalty you speak of.\u201d Rols\u2019s mouth snapped shut.\u201cDid you think I saved your life because I wanted your loyalty? Who are you kidding, you bastard?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201d\u201cThe ones I want to hurt the most are the ones who bared their teeth at my people.\u201dRols hiccuped. Joshua\u2019s grim words made his heart tumble and shake.\u201cYou\u2019re a quick-witted guy, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand what I say next.\u201d His low voice dripped with malice.\u201cJust\u2014 Just give an order, Young Master!\u201d Rols banged his head on the cold, wet ground, cutting his scalp.\u201cTell the soldiers everything you saw today. And\u2014\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes glittered dangerously. \u201c\u2014if anyone else tries something like this again\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take their pathetic lives with my own hands.\u201d\u201cAh! Yes, yes!\u201d Rols kept his answer short; he knew how terrifying Joshua looked even without lifting his head.\u201cNow get out of my sight.\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d Rols forced his shaky legs to carry him away. Destination:\u00a0Anywhere but here!With Rols gone, Joshua\u2019s freezing gaze thawed. He looked beside him: there lay the most beautiful and special woman in his life, the woman he\u2019d yearned for even in his dreams. Joshua\u2019s mother in the flesh.Mother\u2026\u00a0Joshua squeezed his hands together with uncontrollable joy. As his anger subsided, he realized that his childhood was stained with regret and his mother had been his only light. His mother, who died so early.I thank Heaven for granting me another chance. This time will be different. We will never bend.Now he was Joshua von Agnus, only child of a humble maid, spawn of the Duke, not Joshua Sanders, the hero, strongest spear knight in history.\u201cAre you\u2026 really the same person I knew?\u201d Cain, watching the iron-spirited child soften, cautiously spoke up.\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201d Rather than being angry, Joshua burst out laughing.\u201cBut... The Young Master I remember was\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Master\u2019s mistake, the child of a common maid, the dung shoveler\u2026 Should I continue?\u201dCain suddenly stood straight and locked eyes with Joshua.\u201cAt the age of 23, a knight may choose their master.\u201d All knights of the Agnus estate obey the Duke. However, their fealty was ultimately their own choice and responsibility.\u201cNext year, I will also face that decision.\u201d Cain stared intently at Joshua. He took three steps back and gripped the hilt of his sword. \u201cI trust my instincts. In a year\u2019s time I will be by your side, Young Master.\u201d With that, he placed his hand over his heart and bowed.Then he vanished before Joshua could reply.Joshua stared blankly at the air.You idiot.\u00a0He burst out laughing.Cain. A budding Red Knight.This situation was anything but normal. Practically speaking, Cain\u2019s future would be more secure if he gave his loyalty to Babel, the treasure of the Agnus family, rather than Joshua. His thoughts were a mystery.\u201cJoshua?\u201d He was startled by the delicate voice rising from his side.\u201cMother?\u201d Joshua knelt down to help his mother sit up.\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d Lucia forgot her aching body when she saw her child\u2019s face. Her gentle caress on Joshua\u2019s face made his heart melt \u2013 the sensation of having a mother once again was truly incredible.A tear trickled down his cheek.\u201cNow\u2026 I will definitely protect you.\u201dLucia\u2019s smile was brighter than the moon in the sky.Aslan, the ancient empire.It was the most powerful country in the world until, long ago, the continent was riven into the East and West. After thousands of years, it disappeared even from memory. Perhaps ancient tomes contained records of it, but who could say?Now only a few people knew of its existence. Joshua, having returned from decades in the future, was one of them.Duke Agnus\u2019s mansion sat directly on Iris, the ancient capital of the Aslan empire.Who knew?\u00a0Who knew of the great secret hidden beneath the Duke\u2019s magnificent castle?\u201cThis is the place.\u201dIt had been a few hours since he managed to put his mother at ease, who\u2019d only gotten more worried because of his frantic gestures. Time was running out. The sun would rise soon and no one should see him here.When Joshua arrived at his destination, he smiled softly.\u00a0It\u00a0was here.\u201cLugia,\u201d he muttered, and forged onwards.Here he would become the Unrivaled Spear Knight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This imposing, 5-meter boulder, known as the \u201cguardian stone\u201d, shields the estate from danger. However, it is also the connecting passage to the ruins of the ancient capital city, Iris.This place was considered sacred, so it saw few visitors. In fact, it was forbidden to even touch it but Joshua was climbing it nonetheless.In his past life, Joshua frequently visited to connect with his dead mother. He thought it would be better to go to the top of the Duke\u2019s castle, but was turned away at the door.\u201cRight... here.\u201d Joshua reached the top of the rock with a few popped joints and more than a few groans. He groped at the stone for a long time before he managed to find a neatly concealed needle-sized groove. He\u2019d only managed to find it the first time because he swept his hands around every time he climbed the rock.A secret was hidden inside. His eyes lit up, breath hiking, and his blue irises dilated with excitement.Joshua knew what to do next: he needed blood.He bit his index finger and his blood dripped into the groove. It lit up and opened into a tight passage, just large enough to fit Joshua\u2019s small body.Soon, he would see things that defied explanation.Joshua hurled himself into the dark muzzle, which sucked him in with a throbbing sensation across his entire body.The first thing Joshua saw was a narrow passage which, if his memory was correct, opened into a wide cavity. There he would find what he was looking for.What I really need right now.Joshua advanced slowly down the dark passage with a smile, which widened as he approached the end of the tunnel.\u201cAck!\u201d Joshua was momentarily blinded by the bright light.Up to this point, everything had matched his memories of the ruins. But when he opened his eyes\u2026\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice echoed across the damp room.In the middle of the room was one \u2013 completely empty \u2013 altar.Cain de HarryAs his name suggests, he was the son of a noble family. His family traced its roots back to a barren rural land to the Northwest, far from the Duke\u2019s territory, the Viscounty of Harry.His father was the Viscount Bron de Harry. Once, he had earned a position in the center of politics using his hardworking nature and talent for administration. Everything turned upside down when he was almost demoted to Baron but, sure enough, no one could ignore the Harry family\u2019s vast connections.Cain, his son, had been a promising talent since childhood. Curiously, he didn\u2019t inherit his father\u2019s administrative ability and pursued swordsmanship instead.He went to study at the Academy in the Imperial Capital. There he developed his talent and caught the eye of the Grand Duke, leading to him joining the Duke\u2019s army.But no one knew of his true abilities\u2014except one. Everyone else thought that Cain\u2019s abilities were average for a C-Class Knight. Considering he was 22, his skill was only slightly above average.In reality, he\u2019d surpassed the C-Class Knights and even the B-Class Knights. He was beyond simply wielding mana; he was at the point where he could shape it at will. This kind of talent was comparable to Babel, the treasure of the Duke\u2019s family.His talent could land him a position in the Golden Man Order, the strongest arm of the Duke\u2019s army. But for some reason, Cain\u2019s talent was wasting away in the Red Knights.\u201cI have received your report.\u201d A middle-aged man sat behind a desk on a mahogany chair and rummaged through his documents.Chiffon raised his stylishly mustachioed head.\u201cYou also punished two centurions, soldier?\u201d\u201c\u2014Yes.\u201d Cain saluted Chiffon and answered. Chiffon\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cYour actions followed the word of law\u2026 but for the Duke\u2019s centurions, it\u2019s a different story. These centurions belong to the Duke himself, so there must be another reason.\u201d Cain was conflicted for a moment, but his judgement was quick.\u201cThey insulted the Duke\u2019s wife,\u201d he answered.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey tried to sully the mistress, therefore\u2014\u201dChiffon leapt to his feet and slammed his fist against the desk.\u201cIs that true? Those crazy bastards did\u00a0what\u00a0to Lady Vanessa\u2014\u201d\u201cNot Duchess Vanessa.\u201d Cain shook his head quietly. Chiffon gave him a sideways look.\u201cIt was\u2026 Lucia.\u201d Chiffon\u2019s brows furrowed. He sighed and dropped back into his seat.\u201cLucia?\u00a0That\u00a0Lucia?\u201d\u201cYes: the Duke\u2019s second wife.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Chiffon let out a sad laugh. He leaned his head against his palm and glared at Cain. \u201cYou mean you beheaded two centurions for a maid?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not just a maid.\u201d Cain shook his head firmly. \u201cWhatever her status, the Duke\u2019s wife is not to be insulted by a mere soldier.\u201d Chiffon swallowed a heavy sigh. That\u2019s right. Even if Lucia was a maid, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she bore the Duke\u2019s second son.\u201cThe Duke may not pay attention to her, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s relevant. If the Duke hears that Lucia was insulted\u2014\u201d\u201cSetting aside whatever pity you felt for the maid, I assume you are willing to take responsibility.\u201d Chiffon straightened and looked Cain square in the eyes.\u201cIf what I did was wrong, I will gladly accept punishment.\u201d Cain stood proud, hand over heart.\u201c...Alright.\u201d After a long silence, Chiffon sighed. \u201cSorry for doubting you. I know you\u2019re a very smart young man. Maybe I\u2019m just a little sensitive these days.\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Chiffon frowned at his question.\u201cDo you know why I attached you to that lowly child? I wanted to confirm if the rumor of him beating the three centurions was true. Imagine! He was just a dumb child before.\u201d\u201cObviously it\u2019s nonsense, but it had to be verified. If it was true, he could become an obstruction to Master Babel.\u201d\u201c...Why? Do you think Young Master Joshua is a threat to Master Babel?\u201d Chiffon flinched.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a joke\u2026 Don\u2019t say bullshit like that.\u201d His eyes were sharp. \u201cMaster Babel is a once-in-a-lifetime genius. He must become the leader of the family.\u201d\u201cImagine what a shame it would be if Master Babel\u2019s position were stolen away by the son of a lowly maid.\u201d Chiffon made a ridiculous expression. \u201cI just hope that Master Babel\u2019s road will never be blocked, so that he may hone his strength to its full potential. There cannot be any obstacles... We will remove them all, even the tiniest pebble.Pebble,\u00a0Cain mused. That boy he saw was anything but a pebble.\u00a0Perhaps he will tear the sky in two and shake the earth like a meteor.That strange feeling of intimidation Cain felt from Joshua\u2026 He knew he\u2019d felt it before.Joshua von Agnus,\u00a0he muttered with a soft smile.\u00a0I will trust my instincts. They have never failed me before.\u201cAnyways, continue to monitor the child. If there is anything unusual, report it immediately.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d Cain saluted and quickly left the cold office.Cain\u2019s face couldn\u2019t hide his excitement, and his footsteps were lighter than ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right in the middle, there should have been a temple built in the unique style of the ancient empire. His spear, Lugia, was nowhere to be seen, to say nothing of the mana technique that should have been right next to it. Instead, he could only see the faint traces of a temple.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Joshua couldn\u2019t suppress his disappointment.I wonder if anything will change in six years?\u00a0Joshua was fifteen when he found this place in his past life; based on what people were saying, he knew he was nine years old now. Would it be better if he came back when he\u2019d originally found it? Would someone rebuild the temple over the next six years?That\u2019s nonsense.\u00a0Joshua pondered for a moment, then shook his head.\u00a0Only I know about this place.\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d He looked around. Although ruined and fragmented, it was clearly the temple he remembered. Joshua paced towards the altar in the center.His eyes widened. At first glance, it looked as dilapidated as the rest of the temple; but when he approached, he could see a rod of iron where Lugia should have been chained to the altar.\u201cThis stick\u2014\u201d His hand touching the cold iron triggered something unexpected.\u201cWha\u2014\u201d A bright light enveloped young Joshua. He couldn\u2019t move \u2013 all he could do was wait\u2026Duke Agnus\u2019s personal studyWhen the Duke was at his estate rather than the Capital, he spent most of his day in his study.There was a knock on the door.\u201cDuke, the guest has arrived.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus swallowed. He always received visitors when he came to the estate, but he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about this one. This guest, however, while lower-ranked than the Duke, wielded an undeniable influence.Duke Agnus stood and quickly walked out the door.\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201d The old butler, Chiffon, and his soldiers bowed in respect.\u201cWhere are they?\u201d The greatest master of knights in the Empire mustered a proud facade.\u201cI was told they were in the first-floor reception room.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Duke Agnus moved, and Chiffon quickly fell in behind him.\u201cHowever\u2026 Count Rebrecca was not alone,\u201d Chiffon ventured.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cLady Iceline accompanied him.\u201d\u201cI wonder what he\u2019s up to.\u201d Duke Agnus heaved a sigh as he walked.Iceline Jean Rebrecca, daughter of Count Poncel Jean Rebrecca, was also a treasure of the Duchy. Like Babel, she was one of the Empire\u2019s renowned talents: a magical genius who achieved the Second Class at the precocious age of nine.Innate mana sensitivity. Some people were born with the congenital mana disorder, but some people overflowed with it. Iceline was blessed to be able to feel and wield mana by instinct alone. Among wizards, it was considered a God-given blessing.Avalon was an empire of knights, unlike Terra, the Kingdom of Magic, so Iceline was even more of a rarity.The reason Count Rebrecca came here with his precious daughter must be\u2026\u00a0Duke Agnus laughed bitterly.\u201cPoncel is going to make me suffer all day. Young Master Babel will turn fifteen next year. Only three years before his coming-of-age\u2026 Everyone must be anxious. But Babel\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus frowned. \u201cI have Princess Charles for Babel.... How can I\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus let out another deep sigh.The five Dukes of the great Avalon Empire wielded influence beyond imagination. Princess Charles is a daughter of the Pontier family, a Ducal house that rose to power with wealth alone.\u201cAs the Duke said, considering the Pontier family, it is correct to choose Princess Charles.\u201d\u201cI always feel it, but what a pity.\u201d\u201cYou are greedy.\u201d Chiffon chuckled. Duke Agnus\u2019s lust for talent was insatiable, such that it was difficult to just call it mere \u201cgreed\u201d. Chiffon was proud to serve under this master.So long as they have the ability, no one will be discriminated against \u2013 regardless of rank. My master judges people only by their skills.\u00a0Even his own blood.\u201c...What about Joshua?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Chiffon was dragged out of his musings by his master\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018How about we place Iceline by Joshua\u2019s side?\u2019\u201dChiffon couldn\u2019t believe what he heard, and it showed. He had to look twice at the Duke to realize he wasn\u2019t joking.\u201cDuke? But Master Joshua\u2014!\u201d\u201cYes: he is Lucia\u2019s child, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s also my son.\u201dChiffon\u2019s face hardened, and he chose his next words with great care.\u201c...Duke. Unlike Master Babel, Master Joshua has no talent. I apologize for saying this, but until recently everyone called him \u2018dumb\u2019. You saw Joshua for yourself, didn\u2019t you? With his physical condition, even though he\u2019s still young...\u201d Chiffon shook his head. He was convinced that Joshua was born with a mana disability\u2014there was simply no other explanation for his utter lack of mana. \u201cWe need to wait a little longer to be certain, yes. But if it really is a mana disorder\u2026 Introducing such a person to Lady Iceline is a bit\u2014\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. They\u2019re probably waiting.\u201d Duke Agnus gave Chiffon a sideways look and then burst into laughter. He had stopped moving for a while, but set off again with a grin.\u201cDuke, don\u2019t leave me behind!\u201dSomehow, the Duke looked both amused and excited.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201d Joshua let out a groan and cracked open his eyelids. At once, a crushing headache hammered into his skull.\u201cUgh\u2014!\u201d Joshua cussed. The pain felt like it would knock him out at any moment, but somehow he felt like he absolutely could not afford to pass out here. He desperately clung to his thread of consciousness and slowly exercised the only mana technique he knew. One slow breath at a time, the ringing in his head faded away.Some time later, a flash of light snapped his eyes open.\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d He was surrounded by sterile white space. Not even the smallest insect would crawl in here.\u201cAre you here?\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes widened at the echoing voice.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Joshua shouted and whirled around. But he saw nothing\u2026 Just endless bright whiteness.\u201cRight here.\u201d\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes filled with astonishment. Something floated in the pure white space above him.\u201cThe iron rod from before?\u201d\u201cI am not an \u2018iron rod\u2019.\u201d\u00a0Joshua\u2019s mouth fell open. He\u2019d heard of swords with a will, but never in his two lives had Joshua seen such a monstrous object.\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u00a0The object spoke slowly.\u00a0\u201c...the Demonic Spirit, Lugia.\u201d\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207eJoshua fell to the ground in shock.Translator\u2019s Note\u207d\u00b9\u207e\u00a0(\u9b54\u795e\u5668 - literally \u201cDemonic artifact\u201d)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it looked quite odd at first glance, no one would dare mock Lugia. When Joshua wielded Lugia, their overflowing mana made them unchallenged on the battlefield.Which made it difficult to believe that Lugia had transformed into a talking iron rod.\u201cThere is no time.\u201d\u00a0Joshua was roused by Lugia\u2019s voice humming in his head.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe curse within your body will suppress your strength and consume your life as time passes.\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026 You also came back to the past with me?\u201d His eyes widened. It seemed natural since they were together for decades, but it was still strange.\u201cThe only way to break the curse is using your body\u2019s latent power.\u201d\u00a0Lugia couldn\u2019t hear Joshua.\u00a0\u201cIn order to restore that strength, you must be at least at the 4th level of spear mastery.\u201d\u201c4th level!\u201d Perhaps Lugia was talking about the ancient technique he found alongside the spear.The majority of Knights in Igrant viewed the sword as the ultimate weapon. The spear was viewed as a crude toy used by poorly trained conscripts.If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207eAmong the knights, few understood the spear. There were only a handful of people who could compete with Joshua in his past life.Joshua had reached the 5th level of mastery. Even after decades of hard work, the 6th level remained out of reach. In terms of knights\u2019 classes, an A-Class Knight can manifest their mana in the form of a sword. These knights are known as the \u201cAbsolute One\u201d. At the 5th level of his 8-stage spear technique, Joshua was the best knight in the empire. The 4th level, just below it, was equivalent to a B-Class Knight.Joshua\u2019s experience made him confident that he could reach that level, but he was only nine years old. Even before his return, it took him some time.Of course we have to gather our strength. In order to approach Prince Kaiser, I need to show some skill.\u00a0Joshua made a gloomy face.But in my present state...\u00a0Joshua bit his lip.\u00a0Well, don\u2019t I already have experience using it in this state?\u00a0He\u2019d already used a modicum of mana, although the consequences were painful. But even with this sliver of hope it would be difficult to become a C-Class Knight, let alone a master.Lugia began to dissipate into the air with a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary measure but, as long as I\u2019m by your side, you\u2019ll be able to use some of my power without side effects.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cConstantly refine yourself. When you reach the supreme state and regain your lost strength\u2026\u201d\u00a0Lugia\u2019s voice began to fade.\u00a0\u201cTo achieve what you desire\u2026\u201dJoshua rushed closer to catch Lugia\u2019s last whispers.\u201cSelf\u2026 certain steps\u2026 next time\u2026\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d Joshua\u2019s hand shot towards Lugia, who had completely fallen.And\u2026The volatile amalgamation of energies in his body exploded all at once.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dJoshua screamed like his body was being torn apart.First floor reception room, Duke Agnus\u2019s mansion\u201cDuke Agnus has arrived.\u201d Following Imperial etiquette, the servant opened the door after a short delay. The well-oiled hinges swung open almost silently. Inside, two men and two women waited patiently.\u201cOh?\u201d Duke Agnus tilted his head. There were more people than expected.Knights? No, it would be rude for a guest to be accompanied by a knight in the Avalon Empire. It was like saying they didn\u2019t trust their host. Usually, their knights would wait in a different room.Above all else, the atmosphere inside the room was\u2026 off.\u201cCharles?\u201d Duke Agnus saw a familiar face and his eyes widened.\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201d A girl with flaming red hair gracefully greeted Duke Agnus. She was a pretty girl in her early teens with slightly raised brows. She seemed sharp at first glance, but it only enhanced her charm.She was Charles de Pontier, daughter of the Grand Duke Pontier.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cI came here on a whim, so I asked them not to inform you, Duke.\u201d\u201cCox!\u201d Duke Agnus stepped forward with a smile. The short-haired, middle-aged man, Cox von Wagen, was a vassal of the Pontier family. He was born a merchant and rose to nobility, but he was more famous for his nickname: \u201cGold Ingot\u201d; as the name suggested, he had a monstrous appetite for gold. Hardly any money came into the Pontier family without passing through his hands\u2014truly, he was a key figure in the Pontier Duchy.\u201cThe princess insisted we visit, so I accompanied her. My apologies, Duke.\u201d Cox bowed his head with regret.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about! Even when we\u2019re both in the capital, it\u2019s hard to see each other\u2026 When else will I get the chance to see you like this?\u201d Duke Agnus took it in stride with a cheerful smile.\u201cThank you for kind words.\u201d At that, Duke Agnus smiled mischievously.\u201cIf you\u2019re really sorry, how about you work for me now?\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cUncle, it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen you. You didn\u2019t even greet me and you\u2019re already trying to poach our people?\u201d\u201cPrincess!\u201d Cox\u2019s face flushed pale blue.I\u2019ve known the Princess since she was very young and she always treated me as a thing, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I treat myself like an object\u2026\u00a0But Duke Agnus was an entirely different story. Just as Cox was about to apologize, Duke Agnus burst into pleasant laughter.\u201cHahaha! Yes, Charles, it was a very poor greeting indeed. You\u2019re the same Charles I remember.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Charles pursed her lips. \u201cBut, Sir Chiffon, where is Babel?\u201d\u201cAh, the master....\u201d Looking between them, Duke Agnus smiled strangely.\u201cOh, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Charles noted his smile. \u201cI am of the same mind as you. As you know, our family has great wealth, and no one can challenge your strength.\u201d\u201cHummm.\u201d\u201cBy the time I heard Babel was promoted to a C-Class Knight, the rumors had already spread all over the capital. So I thought I might try recruiting a talent.\u201d\u201cPrincess, you say too much!\u201d Cox couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He shook his head tearfully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke. The Princess is still immature\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Charles\u2019s voice was shrill.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re just at that age.\u201d Duke Agnus waved it off, but quickly shifted to an embarrassed expression.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ponsel. I forgot about you.\u201d\u201cNo, Duke.\u201d The scholarly man in his mid-thirties bowed his head. This blue-haired, sad-eyed man with a soft impression was Ponsel Jean Rebrecca, famed for his sorcery.Beside him was a girl with a rather similar atmosphere. She had wavy blue hair which flowed down like a waterfall and big droopy eyes. If Charles were \u201cpretty\u201d, this girl was \u201cbeautiful\u201d. She was Rebrecca\u2019s last hope, the only remaining child of the Countess, and magical genius, Iceline Jean Rebrecca.\u201cYou came, Lady Iceline.\u201d Duke Agnus greeted her with a small smile.\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201d\u201cI came all the way here to get something to eat\u2014\u201d Charles made a dissatisfied expression.\u201cPrincess, why are you like this?\u201d Cox grumbled.\u201cOh! I heard something!\u201d Ignoring Cox, Charles clapped her hands as if she\u2019d remembered something. \u201cI heard you have another son, but he\u2019s sick so he doesn\u2019t stay in the mansion or something\u2014\u201d\u201cPrincess, that story!\u201d Cox shouted in terror and embarassment.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place\u2026 I don\u2019t think the stable is a good place, but\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus smiled bitterly.\u201cOh, a stable?\u201d Charles looked surprised. \u201cSo it\u2019s true he\u2019s your son?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201cAHA! Then\u2014\u201d\u201cPrincess, please!\u201dI haven\u2019t said anything yet,\u00a0Charles frowned.Please, please!\u00a0Cox couldn\u2019t hide his anxious expression.\u00a0I pray the Princess doesn\u2019t go any further. I pray that I live to greet the sunrise...But fate was not on Cox\u2019s side.\u201c\u2014He would go perfectly with Iceline.\u201dCox cracked.Editor\u2019s note\u207d\u00b9\u207e\u00a0Quote from *The Art of War*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a merchant, Cox was very sensitive when it came to reading the atmosphere \u2013 doubly so when he was in the same room as both a Count and a Grand Duke. Even though Cox was one of the most respected Counts of the Pontier family, he had no problem humbling himself.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not something to lower yourself for.\u201d Count Poncel Jean Rebrecca shook his head with a faint smile. \u201cMoreover\u2026 I\u2019ve heard that rumor too, Duke.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cMay I enquire, if it\u2019s not too rude?\u201d\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s not half bad even if he\u2019s a bastard,\u201d Charles spouted.\u201cPrincess, please refrain from further rudeness!\u201d Cox shouted before Charles could continue.\u201cWhat rudeness? I only told the truth,\u201d she pouted.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Counts need to worry so much.\u201d\u201cSir Chiffon?\u201d Cox tilted his head questioningly.\u201cWell\u2026 As the Princess said, Young Master Joshua is unwell, so he\u2019s recuperating.\u201d\u201cMy word\u2026 What manner of affliction?\u201d Cox asked with a worried face. Chiffon eyed Duke Agnus before replying.\u201cFrom my observations, it seems to be congenital mana disorder.\u201d\u201cThe Curse of Mana!\u201d Ponsel shouted in surprise. This curse \u2013 congenital mana disorder \u2013 was rare enough to break his normally quiet atmosphere. A strange look passed through Iceline\u2019s eyes, who otherwise sat expressionless like a doll.\u201cWhat the hell? A kid knocked out three soldiers with that kind of illness\u2026\u201d Charles mumbled with a sullen expression. Cox and Ponsel shared a sympathetic look.Their interest in Joshua, however, was cursory. Although they did not say it, they were only here for Babel von Agnus.\u201cWell, Ponsel, how about you take a look at the boy?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Ponsel stared blankly back at the Duke.\u201cAfter all, aren\u2019t there only a few 5th-Class Wizards in the Empire?\u201dA 5th-Class Wizard was respected wherever they went; with the exception of the Magical Kingdom, Terra, someone with that level of skill could become the royal chief wizard wherever they chose. Considering the relative lack of wizards in the Avalon Empire, Ponsel was especially valuable; indeed, he was one of the three most powerful people in the Avalon Empire.\u201c\u2014All right.\u201d Ponsel nodded softly. It wasn\u2019t too difficult, and he could earn the Duke\u2019s regard for a simple favor.\u201cThank you.\u201dChiffon adopted a faint frown \u2013 it was his habit to frown when something was not to his liking.\u201cDuke, why don\u2019t you go and evaluate Master Joshua\u2019s talent?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Duke Agnus tilted his head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certain it\u2019s congenital mana disorder but\u2026 if you\u2019re willing, wouldn\u2019t it be better to check his health before leaving for the capital?\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus stroked his chin with a troubled expression.\u201cIf Count Ponsel is with you, you can observe him a little easier.\u201d Wizards were more sensitive to mana. The way wizards and knights manipulate mana are fundamentally different, but wizards could feel the \u201cflow\u201d of mana.\u201cThat would be fantastic\u2026 And, I get to see my younger brother.\u201d Charles clapped her hands. \u201cOh, you said he\u2019s nine years old, so he\u2019s younger than me right? Three years younger.\u201d\u201cHahh...\u201d Cox was at a loss.\u201cHow do you plan to judge him?\u201d Duke Agnus asked Chiffon.\u201cWith your orders, I will send one of my knights to him.\u201d\u201cOne of the Red Knights?\u201d Duke Agnus frowned. Chiffon was unperturbed.\u201cIf Master Joshua can take down three centurions with his bare hands, then a Red Knight should be enough.\u201d\u201cI think we should consider the other knights too.\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s answer was expected for the most prestigious family of knights in the Empire.\u201cOf course, the other knights are excellent but, for the Young Master\u2019s safety, wouldn\u2019t it be better to have someone who can control their strength?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d When Duke Agnus seemed concerned, Chiffon quickly added:\u201cI have the perfect candidate.\u201d\u201cA suitable member of the Red Knights\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a knight you know well,\u201d Chiffon continued with a smirk.His voice was strangely chilly.\u201cUgh!\u201d Joshua took a deep breath and opened his eyes. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201dThe first thing he saw when he woke up was the ruins of the ancient temple. The white space he was in earlier was nowhere to be seen.\u201cWas it real?\u201d Joshua mumbled. But the weight in his hand told him it was neither dream nor fantasy.\u201cLugia?\u201d The staff \u2013 he couldn\u2019t bring himself to call it a spear \u2013 rested in his hand. This comfortable and familiar grip\u2014clearly it was Lugia, his dear friend and partner.\u201cAs long as I\u2019m by your side\u2026\u201d\u00a0Lugia\u2019s last words flickered through his mind. Joshua closed his eyes and began to exercise his mana technique.Now!\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes snapped open. An inscrutable black haze rose from his body, a phenomenon that only occurred when his mana technique was operating normally. Joshua hefted the iron rod and straightened his posture.\u201cHooo!\u201d Joshua took a short deep breath and stared straight ahead. This ancient spear technique \u2013 the \u201cMagic Spear Technique\u201d \u2013 was divided into multiple stages, but his destination was clear.Can I draw even a handful of mana from the air?\u00a0That was the standard for the first stage.I can do it.\u00a0His grip on the iron rod firmed.Lower your posture and contract your muscles, so that you can apply your full strength in one moment.\u00a0His muscles tightened like they would snap into action at any moment.The first form: Stabbing.\u00a0There were only two spear methods in the first stage of his technique.In a way, it was just a simple stab\u2014a straight line to the target. Concise and straightforward, but fast.At the tip of the iron rod, a coin-sized mote of mana condensed. And when the mana was compressed to a point\u2026\u201cThunder.\u201dA swarm of pure white light thrust forth from the end of the rod.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each group of knights had a dedicated gymnasium and there was even one for individual training. Past the third-largest of these gymnasiums was a stone building with a red cross flag waving above it: the headquarters of the Red Knights.\u201cCaptain, this is Cain.\u201d Cain knocked on a certain door.\u201cCome in.\u201d Cain was already a bit out of sorts, so he was startled by the sudden reply. Behind the door he found the commander of the Red Knights neatly sat in the middle of the room.\u201cI was told you needed to see me.\u201d Cain saluted his superior.\u201cWell,\u201d Chiffon nodded slightly. \u201cI need you to do something.\u201d\u201cPlease name it.\u201d Cain straightened.\u201cPerhaps today or tomorrow, the Duke will call you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Cain\u2019s eyes widened slightly. He may be a member of one of the most successful orders in the estate, but he was only a low-ranked knight himself. The number of times such a knight encounters the Duke could be counted on one hand.\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous, \u2018cause I\u2019ll be with you\u2026 along with the two counts and their daughters\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Count Rebrecca and Count Wagen?\u201d Cain\u2019s eyes widened further. He\u2019d heard they were visiting the Duke, but what could bring such a collection of high-ranking nobles together?\u201cHmm\u2026 It seems that the Duke intends to test Master Joshua.\u201d\u201cThey are testing the Master?\u201d Cain stared blankly at Chiffon.\u201cObviously, Lord Joshua is suffering from congenital mana disorder, but the Duke has doubts. So I\u2019ll nip it in the bud. This time, we can blow away any lingering suspicions.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d Cain gulped, but Chiffon was tranquil.\u201cIt is a subordinate\u2019s duty to alleviate their master\u2019s worries. I\u2019ll amputate the crippled limb.\u201dWhat did he just say? Has he gone insane!?\u00a0No matter how high-ranked you were, to say such a thing about the son of the Master without a hint of regret...There must be some sort of relationship between Master Babel and Sir Chiffon\u2026\u00a0Cain could no longer deny it.\u00a0It\u2019s no wonder Sir Chiffon is biased.Knights of the Duchy choose their masters, but it only changes priority. No matter which vassal they pledge their loyalty too, they ultimately take orders from the Duke.I guessed Sir Chiffon pledged himself to Master Babel, but I never knew he\u2019d be so blatant as this.\u00a0This was bad\u2014Cain had already committed himself to Joshua, after all.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to put up that facade.\u201d Chiffon eyed Cain\u2019s troubled expression. \u201cHe\u2019s also a child of the Master\u2026 even if he\u2019s a mistake. Don\u2019t tell anyone, or you\u2019ll be punished.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Cain nodded reflexively.\u201cSo I thought I\u2019d try something different. In order to confirm the truth of the rumors, we decided he should spar with a knight in front of everyone, including the two counts.\u201d Chiffon locked eyes with Cain. \u201cHis opponent is you.\u201dDamn it\u2026\u00a0Cain knew this would happen.\u201cDuring the battle\u2026 find the right moment to use your mana.\u201d\u201cYou want me to use mana?\u201d\u201cObviously, don\u2019t use it openly. The spectators will be masters of war\u2014in short, the very kind of people most sensitive to mana. Even a subtle flow of mana won\u2019t go unnoticed. Instead, you will only infuse the tiniest bit of mana into your body\u2026 If Master Joshua really has a congenital mana disorder, that alone will be fatal.\u201dCongenital mana disorders were a terrifying thing. It was more than a lack of mana: the body was actually fatally allergic to it. Any mana \u2013 even naturally occurring \u2013 being injected into their body\u2026Even left alone he wouldn\u2019t live to see 18 years. If it\u2019s really a congenital mana disorder, his life is in jeopardy. But the Master Joshua I saw...\u201cFor now, you just have to wait. Be prepared,\u201d Chiffon continued, unaware of Cain\u2019s thoughts..\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cSee yourself out.\u201dCain saluted and turned away.This isn\u2019t so bad. With such a small amount of mana, the commander won\u2019t notice if I don\u2019t use any at all.\u00a0Cain had decided to support Joshua. There was no way he would harm the boy, even under orders from his direct superior.I\u2019m not suited for these kinds of things.\u00a0Cain moved away from the office with a determined expression.I hope everything goes as planned.\u201cBrother Babel!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Babel turned his head behind him. \u201cCharles?\u201d\u201cLong time no see!\u201d Charles clung to Babel.\u201cWhen are you\u2014\u201d Babel abruptly realized Charles was not alone.\u201cLong time no see, Young Master.\u201d Iceline lowered her head. Babel stared blankly as she greeted him with an elegance beyond her age.\u201cIceline, you\u2019re here too.\u201dCharles\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cOh, I see...\u201d Charles quickly interjected herself between them. \u201cI heard you have a younger brother!\u201d\u201cBrother?\u201d Babel frowned. \u201cMaybe\u2026 that peasant bastard\u2014\u201d Iceline\u2019s chilly gaze shut his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about the maid\u2019s child, are you?\u201d\u201cYes? I knew he was a bastard, but a maid\u2019s son?\u201d Charles rolled her eyes.\u201cYeah. The dung shoveler is trying to show off.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Charles adopted a pitying expression. \u201cA Duke\u2019s child and horse dung\u2026 how pitiful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pity him!\u201d Babel\u2019s smile turned shifty. \u201cHe was born from dirty origins and with mana disorder.\u201d\u201cAh! I heard that too. He has the Curse of Mana, right?\u201d Charles clapped her hands, saying\u00a0\u2018Cheap!\u2019\u201cHah, the heavens must be angered by his mere existence.\u201d\u201cBut they said\u2026 it might not be the curse after all.\u201d Charles tilted her head.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe Duke said he would test it himself.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Babel frowned. As the atmosphere curdled, Iceline stepped forward.\u201cThey want to confirm if the rumor \u2013 of Master Joshua beating the three centurions \u2013 is real. That would also prove if he has a congenital mana disorder or not.\u201d\u201cIceline?\u201d Babel flinched at her quiet voice.\u201cThat\u2019s why my father is organizing a sparring session. That way, the most subtle flow of mana will be easily captured.\u201d\u201cWhy is Count Rebrecca\u2026?\u201d Babel trailed off with a confused look.\u201cThis is what Duke Agnus asked for,\u201d Iceline answered.\u201cFather?\u201d Babel suddenly grinned sharply. He turned to Charles urgently.\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhen and where are they sparring?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026 Maybe today or tomorrow. The Duke said it would be held in the small theater.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but it\u2019s a pity it won\u2019t go anywhere.\u00a0Babel clenched his fists tightly. He couldn\u2019t forget his strict upbringing\u2014even when he\u2019d used mana at only fourteen, his father had no special reaction.Are you looking forward to next year? Go right ahead.\u00a0A deep chill settled in Babel\u2019s eyes.\u00a0If he\u2019s still alive by then.By the time Joshua left the ancient ruins, the sun was past its apex.\u201cWhat a day,\u201d Joshua sighed.I have to\u2026 No one will go looking for a bastard who was practically thrown out, but\u2026\u00a0Most likely, he would have been found out by morning. He moved quickly.The Duke\u2019s mansion appeared in the distance. As Joshua approached, his eyes widened: standing in front of the entrance door was a familiar figure.Is that Cain?\u00a0Cain also noticed him. They slowly closed.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cSome morning exercise.\u201d Joshua resisted the urge to walk away.\u201cThat stick?\u201d Cain cast a glance at Lugia.\u201cMy training weapon.\u201d\u201cThe commander is looking for you.\u201d Cain looked like he had more questions, but he didn\u2019t inquire further.\u201c\u2018Commander\u2019? Are you referring to the leader of the Red Knights?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Joshua stared at Cain. Cain took a hesitant breath. \u201cProbably because of the spar.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt looks like the Young Master\u2019s skill will be judged by the Duke.\u201d Cain paused and examined Joshua. \u201cYour opponent will be knocked over immediately.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Joshua gulped.Apparently, Duke Agnus had noticed his skills to some extent. Otherwise, there was no reason to talk much less test his so-called 'skill\u201d. After all, Duke Agnus\u2019s hunger for talent was legendary.What is this\u2026\u00a0Joshua lifts his head to look at Cain, who gives him a pitying look.I\u2019ll show you.\u00a0Joshua harrumphed. Cain misunderstood.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of seriously sparring.\u201d\u201cYou mean you have no intention of winning?\u201d Cain nodded back.\u201cI\u2019ll just pretend to lose. So don\u2019t worry\u2014\u201d\u201cHow funny.\u201d Cain\u2019s eyes widened at Joshua\u2019s cynical muttering. \u201cAre you going to rig the game?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Cain struggled to answer.He\u2019s right. I wanted to watch over the Young Master for a long time\u2026 I can\u2019t harm him.However\u2026\u201cYou knights have the right to choose your lord\u2026 But I, too, have the right to choose my subordinates.\u201d Cain was frozen stiff. \u201cThe most important thing in the relationship between master and subordinate is mutual trust. I have no intention of entrusting my back to such a petty, weak-minded person. If you want to see the real me\u2026 Do your best.\u201d\u201cAfter all, why else do you wield the sword?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of the two men standing in front of it opened his mouth:\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Cain said. Joshua nodded silently in reply.A group of people, including Duke Agnus, approached in the distance \u2013 exactly five men and two women: Duke Agnus, the two counts, and Chiffon, as well as\u2014?\u201cYoung Master Babel?\u201d Cain\u2019s eyes widened when he noticed an unexpected addition to the group, trailing behind the girls. Cain felt his stomach drop.\u201cYou arrived first.\u201d\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201d Cain crisply made his greetings. Chiffon, however, was watching Joshua, waiting for him to fumble his greeting. Unfortunately for him, Joshua\u2019s salute was picture perfect.How could this boy manage such a perfect salute?\u00a0Astonishment flickered through Chiffon\u2019s eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t remember teaching him etiquette, but he\u2019s really good at it.\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s eyes held a different sort of light than Chiffon.\u201cI just learned by watching.\u201d Joshua stood firm and looked the Duke square in the eyes.\u201cHahahaha.\u201d Duke Agnus straightened up and asked, \u201cWere you informed?\u201dJoshua nodded.\u201cThey said you wanted to test me.\u201d\u201cA test....\u201d Duke Agnus trailed off into a fresh bout of laughter.\u201cPlease be careful with your choice of words, Young Master.\u201d Chiffon stepped forward, having gotten his expression under control. \u201cYou said it was a test.\u201dJoshua gave Chiffon a placid stare.\u201cIt\u2019s not a test, it\u2019s a diagnosis. The Duke only wishes to cure the Young Master\u2019s disability.\u201d\u201cDisability?\u201d Joshua was briefly embarrassed.Chiffon\u2019s slowly escalating mockery; Babel\u2019s unexpected appearance; the \u201ccongenital mana disorder\u201d; and Duke Agnus, who was supposed to wait a year, suddenly testing Joshua\u2014the puzzle pieces were falling into place.Right\u2026 Valderas den Chiffon was one of Babel\u2019s people.\u00a0In his last life, Joshua had left the Duke\u2019s family before he reached adulthood so he didn\u2019t know the specifics of the family\u2019s internal circumstances. He was much better informed of events in the distant future.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Duke Agnus asked.\u201cYes.\u201d As Joshua answered, Cain took a step forward.\u201cNot you.\u201d Duke Agnus slowly shook his head.\u201cYes?\u201d Cain asked blankly.\u201cA match between an adult and a child of less than ten years. The difference in basic strength is significant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Cain nodded his head in agreement. He was at something of a loss.Wasn\u2019t it inconvenient to raise my sword at someone who might become a master in the future?\u00a0It was like all his worries had been washed away in an instant.\u201cWe owe this to Master Babel himself: he said he would help his brother by sparring with him.\u201dJoshua didn\u2019t miss the sly smile that danced across Babel\u2019s lips for a moment.These guys\u2026\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes turned cold.\u00a0Now I know for sure what these guys are thinking.They intended to make a villain of Joshua under the guise of sparring.If that\u2019s what you really think\u2026\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes were freezing cold.\u00a0Let me show you.Originally, Joshua hadn\u2019t had any plans for the Duke of Agnus in mind. In spite of their fearsome reputation, the Duke of Agnus and his army would collapse in about 15 years.A great war would take place in the next 10 years. This war would last for three years and result in the worst casualties in history. Duke Agnus would die in battle on the vast plains of Kraden.After the war, Babel von Agnus, the Duke\u2019s treasure, struggled to rebuild the family\u2019s glory alone. But when the First Civil War broke out in the weakened Empire, Babel threw in with the ill-fated Second Prince. After that\u2026I heard the First Prince destroyed his mana hall and he became a delinquent.\u00a0Joshua smiled bitterly.At the time, Joshua was working as a wandering mercenary. Before the outbreak of the Second Civil War, the Fourth Prince, Kaiser von Britten, caught his eyes.The reason Joshua wanted to leave the estate without regrets was that, even with his family\u2019s support, he was confident that he would achieve his goals. It was the minimum of politeness to the family where he was born and raised.But that was then and this is now.In the past, Joshua used whatever he could to reach his objectives.But on the other hand, with the Duke\u2019s support my work here would be easier. Right, Kaiser von Britten?\u201cAs it is sparring, you will be required to use a wooden sword rather than the longsword,\u201d Duke Agnus said.\u201cI have already prepared.\u201d Babel held up the wooden sword he had prepared in advance. Duke Agnus turned to Joshua.\u201cThen you\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is fine.\u201d Joshua picked up a broken push rod. For a moment, everyone was flabbergasted.\u201cIs he kidding? Sparring with a stick...\u201d Charles muttered.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Joshua replied to Duke Agnus without hesitation.\u201cGood.\u201d Everyone but Joshua and Babel retreated from the hall.\u201cBabel, you already know this, but never use mana.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Babel said.\u201cI won\u2019t need it to beat this bastard,\u201d\u00a0he muttered under his breath.\u201cDo you think you can scratch my sword with something as petty as that?\u201d Babel glared at his opponent. \u201cI think a bag of horse dung is more suitable for a worm like you\u2026 since you\u2019ll be a mess anyways.\u201d Babel stepped forward with a grin.\u201cBegin.\u201d As the Duke\u2019s voice boomed across the quiet hall, Babel\u2019s smile deepened.Just a touch of this will make your bones cry.\u00a0Babel had a reason for preparing a sword in advance. This sword had an iron core beneath the wood \u2013 he was sure it would hurt more than a wooden sword.\u00a0Fitting for this bastard.\u201cHAH!\u201d Babel planted his feet firmly on the ground.\u00a0I\u2019ll beat you into a pulp!Babel shot towards Joshua with a mocking smile on his lips. He hefted his sword over his head, poised to strike Joshua\u2019s skull. Babel, the famed C-Class Knight, put all of his power into this strike.The movement is just fast, and therefore simple.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes lit up. It was an ignorant move that didn\u2019t even consider Joshua counterattacking.Joshua\u2019s arm stretched out just in time.Tak! The sound of a light strike filled the hall. Everyone\u2019s eyes flew open.Joshua had deflected the sword with the tip of his stick. Babel\u2019s arms were flung into the air, leaving half his body exposed. It was a god-like, awe-inspiring move, but the concentration and alertness it needed was equally impressive.Babel couldn\u2019t hide his bewilderment at the sudden turnaround.Joshua spun to the side and, using the rotational force, slammed his stick into Babel\u2019s open side.\u201cOw!\u201d Babel grit his teeth, suppressing a moan from reaching the audience. His expression curdled as if he had been bit by a bug.This\u2026\u00a0Joshua was disappointed.\u00a0This is pure strength without mana.The body of an untrained nine-year-old child had its limits.If it goes like this\u2014\u00a0Joshua clenched his weapon. It was only a wooden stick, but it would allow him to fully leverage his knowledge of the spear.Keep your distance. Hit and run using the long reach\u2014\u00a0Joshua\u2019s meditations were interrupted.A subtle change was taking place before his eyes\u2014he could feel it. With a subtle vibration, mana gathered on Babel\u2019s wooden sword. It was not fully formed, like a hazy mist, but Joshua knew better than anyone how dangerous it was. This hazy mana was exclusive to a Class-C mana user.\u201cDie!\u201d Babel\u2019s anger boiled over.Where not only my father but Iceline and the others are watching!\u00a0A single blow from a mere worm left a gaping wound in Babel\u2019s pride.Babel, eyes rolling wildly, ran straight at Joshua.\u201cThis\u2014!\u201d Duke Agnus leapt from his seat. Count Rebrecca also started moving with a stiff expression. \u201cSTOP!\u201dBut Duke Agnus was the one who stopped.Another flow of mana.\u00a0It was small, but a second stream of mana could be felt from the two boys.\u201cNo way.\u201d Duke Agnus raised his hand to prevent Count Rebrecca from moving further forward, staring straight ahead.Mana gathered, small as a coin, but Duke Agnus and Count Rebrecca \u2013 the finest in their fields \u2013 could feel the peculiar air.After a long moment, his gaze frozen in place, dumbfounded words spilled from Duke Agnus\u2019s lips.\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026\u201d ...was where the mana gathered.No one else but this nine-year-old boy, his own blood. Nowhere else but the tip of the stick he held.\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d Astonishment swept the audience.A timeless genius, never before seen in history.His small steps echoed quietly around him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They couldn't believe it.What is this?\u00a0their eyes seemed to ask.But Babel, filled with jealousy, struck at Joshua with all his hatred. His eyes were cold and unforgiving, and filled with all the power the young successor could muster.\u201cHAH!\u201d With his sword held high, he cut diagonally across Joshua's body. However, Joshua read the attack and deliberately stepped closer, lowering his body to avoid the attack. From this defensive move, one might say Babel had the upper hand\u2014but sometimes, being too aggressive would leave you defenseless.Every muscle in Joshua's body exploded into motion. His stick, which he\u2019d held carelessly, lunged at Babel.Babel's eyes widened\u2014it was too fast!One of the sword's greatest strengths is its speed; a weapon as long as a spear, like Joshua's stick, could not hope to compete. However, despite raising his sword first, Babel's sword lagged behind Joshua's rod.Rather than the usual clatter when two wooden weapons collide, the hall was instead rattled by an explosion.Mana and mana.A collision of Joshua's mana, no bigger than a coin but condensed to its limit, against Babel's hazy mana.Everyone watching was astonished; what happened defied all of their expectations. Unlike Joshua, who took a single step back, Babel stumbled backwards three entire steps.\u201cKeugh!\u201d Babel, stomach churning, let out a harsh cough. He couldn't believe what was happening. He was indeed\u2026 losing.Is it really mana?This unwanted bastard?Trash born from peasant blood?Mana?Moreover, mana \u2013 the end-all, be-all of weaponry in the Empire \u2013 wielded by someone younger than him?\u201cDon't make me laugh!\u201d he shouted. Teeth grinding, Babel breathed more and more mana into his sword. His hazy mana began to take on a vivid color.That's not real mana! I don't know what kind of trick he pulled\u2026\u00a0Unlike him, who cloaked his entire sword in mana, the scum in front of him had a tiny mote of mana on the tip of his stick. Surely there couldn't be any mana in that.It's just a coincidence! This time I\u2019ll prove\u2026\u00a0Babel bunched up his legs\u2014he was preparing to attack Joshua again.\u201cStop!\u201d Duke Agnus's mana-infused roar shook the walls of the gymnasium.\u201cUgh.\u201d Joshua and Babel, who were close to the Duke, clutched their ears. Count Rebrecca, standing right next to him, was no different. The boys came to their senses and turned to find the source of the sound: Duke Agnus\u2026\u201cYou had to stop,\u201d he murmured, and looked back. \u201cChiffon, isn't this enough?\u201dChiffon was shaken from his astonishment by Duke Agnus's question.\u201cDo you still think Joshua has a congenital mana disorder?\u201dThat\u2014\u201d Chiffon licked his lips and glanced to the side. There stood Joshua, silently gripping his stick. Chiffon bowed his head briefly to Duke Agnus, hesitantly saying:\u201cBut Duke, that mana\u2014\u201d\u201cClearly, it was mana alright.\u201d Count Rebrecca interrupted. \u201cYoung Master Joshua's mana was not normal mana at all. In terms of quantity, it was incomparable to Young master Babel. But the concentration\u2026\u201d Count Rebrecca swallowed hard.The audience wore mixed expressions.\u201cMmm\u2026 Then you're really a mana user\u2014a C-Class Knight?\u201dCharles, mouth agape, bounced out of her seat.Iceline's normally expressionless face hinted at her agitation.\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d Cain smiled, muttering so softly that only he could hear. His eyes were not wrong. I thought that this little boy might one day him, this boundless colossus.\u00a0\u207d\u00b9\u207e\u201cMana at the age of nine.\u201d Though quiet, Duke Agnus's voice was heard clearly. An obvious smile graced his lips. \u201cHow amusing.\u201dSparing one last glance at Joshua, Duke Agnus turned away.\u201cDuke\u2026?\u201d Chiffon muttered blankly at Duke Agnus's back.\u201cDon't talk about it anymore.\u201d\u00a0\u207d\u00b2\u207eChiffon immediately shut his mouth and followed. He knew better than anyone how to act when Duke Agnus's voice oozed with such a sense of intimidation. His master, Duke Aden von Agnus, was infinitely kind in front of his trustworthy subordinates, but would never show mercy to someone who crossed the line \u2013 no matter how talented.\u201cPoncel.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d\u201cThank you for today.\u201d\u201cIt's nothing,\u201d Count Rebrecca answered quietly, shaking his head.\u201cJust go back. And\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus glanced behind him. \u201cBabel.\u201d\u201cYou follow me.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Babel answered weakly.\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus paused for a moment. Joshua, receiving the Duke's attention, straightened. \u201cCome to my room tonight.\u201d\u00a0\u207d\u00b3\u207eChiffon and Babel were shaken\u2014Duke Agnus had never invited anyone to his room until now. The Duke spent most of the day in his office. To his family, Duke Agnus's room was nothing more than a secret space.\u201cAll right,\u201d Joshua answered in a quiet voice.Duke Agnus smiled with satisfaction and walked away.Babel, who had been staring at Joshua for a long time, the two Counts, who were lost in thought, Charles, who was busy examining Joshua's face, and Iceline, whose face was once again expressionless, followed after Duke Agnus.\u201cI want my master to be someone strong.\u201d With only the two of them left, Cain quietly spoke up. \u201cActually, as a knight sworn to lay down his life to protect his master, this is an absurd idea\u2026\u201d\u201cFor ten years, I grew up watching the back of Duke Agnus\u2026 I hope the master I serve will be stronger than the Grand Duke. If the master suddenly becomes weak, it's hard to judge the future of the Estate.\u201d Cain bowed with a before unseen respect. \u201cI wish you all the best, Young Master.\u201dShortly after Count Cox von Wagen and Charles returned to their room\u2026\u201cCox, that's great! This is awesome!\u201d\u201cPrincess, please calm down!\u201d Watching Charles run around in excitement, Cox broke out in a cold sweat.\u201cA mana user at the age of nine! Does this make sense? Uncle and Babel were in their mid-teens!\u201d\u201cHah\u2026 Princess, I\u2019m surprised too\u2026 but please don't get too excited.\u201d\u201cThere's been a change in plans\u2026\u201d Charles continued without listening to Cox. \u201cHe is a bastard in my mind, yes\u2026 but with that kind of talent, it's a very different story!\u201dWhy do bad omens always come true?Cox nervously awaited his master's next words.\u201cShouldn't he be back in the mansion by now?\u201d Charles, who was rolling around on the bed, bounced back to a sitting posture.\u201cPrincess, please?\u201d Cox frowned anxiously.\u201cCox, relax!\u201d With this beauty and prestige, how do you think I got this far?\u201d\u201cPrincess!\u201d Cox screamed at Charles's disappearing back.Creak.Cox slumped as he stared at the tightly shut door.\u201cOh, God.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had long been a country with strongly centralized power. There were many nobles who boasted great power, but all bowed before the authority of the Imperial Palace.This was owed to Marcus von Britten, the current emperor and only Sword Master in the Empire, who had ruled the throne with an iron fist for over a decade. Now in his late thirties, with the support of numerous nobles, his continued reign was assured.Emperor Marcus von Britten\u2019s temper was famous. In front of him, any noble who bared their teeth were purged \u2013 he firmly believed there was no such thing as a permanent friend, even a family that had loyally served the Imperial family for generations.No mercy for a traitor to the crown!It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was his determined personality that defined the present-day Marcus von Britten, the Iron-Blooded Emperor.Matching his awful personality, the Emperor had a sister: Duchess Vanessa von Agnus, the legal wife of Duke Agnus and mother of Babel von Agnus.A chandelier adorned the ceiling of a large room, luxuriously furnished and lushly carpeted.In the middle, she sat with legs crossed on a soft sofa made from high-quality furs.From the sharply raised eyebrows, to the dull blonde hair, to the faint wrinkles of age, to the black dots beside her eyes, Duchess Vanessa radiated intimidation. This woman, whose beauty had not faded with age, was the wife of Duke Agnus.\u201cI have something to report,\u201d said the man kneeling before her.\u201cTell me, Sir Chiffon.\u201d It was none other than Valderas den Chiffon, commander of the Red Knights.\u201cThat is\u2014\u201dSeeing his hesitation, Vanessa tilted her head questioningly. Chiffon sighed.\u201c\u2014It has to do with Young Master Babel.\u201d\u201cBabel?\u201d Vanessa straightened. Babel is her son. When it came to him, the Duchess was famous for handling it roughly.\u201cWhat happened to Babel?\u201d\u201c...The Duke tested Prince Joshua.\u201d At \u201cJoshua\u201d, Vanessa\u2019s long eyebrows twitched.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to call him that in front of me, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d There was a chill in Vanessa\u2019s voice.\u201c...Sorry. The Duke ordered a spar with a knight to test Joshua.\u201d\u201cReally? How odd.\u201d Vanessa made a ridiculing face. \u201cA mere maid\u2019s child. What did he do to deserve that kind of treatment?\u201d\u201cIt seems the Duke was trying to confirm the truth of the rumors about the centurions\u2026 And the other day I reported that Joshua had a congenital mana disorder\u2026\u201d Chiffon trailed off with a look of regret. \u201cThe child was born with a mana disability.\u201d\u201cWhat of it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2014\u201d Chiffon bit his lip and continued with difficulty. \u201cHe used mana.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanessa frowned as if she\u2019d misheard.\u201cJoshua used mana. Perhaps comparable to a C-Class Knight\u2014\u201dVanessa leapt from her seat like a startled cat.\u201cAre you joking with me, Sir Chiffon?\u201d Her gaze was murderous. \u201cMana? At that age? With that background?! He\u2019s neither a wizard nor a knight, but you\u2019re telling me he used mana?! Does that make sense?\u201dVanessa strode right up to Chiffon and lifted her hand without hesitation.Damn!\u00a0With a loud smack, Chiffon\u2019s head snapped to the side.\u201cWhat is your mission?\u201d Vanessa growled.\u201cTo assist the Duke. Duke Agnus\u2014\u201d\u201cNot some frivolous thing like that!\u201d\u201c\u2014To help Prince Babel and the Duchess become greater than anyone else.\u201d\u201cHow do you think you are doing right now?\u201d Vanessa glared directly into Chiffon\u2019s eyes. \u201cDid Sir Chiffon perhaps forget his only purpose in life?\u201d\u201cIn any case, the truth\u2014\u201d Before he could finish, Vanessa\u2019s hand was raised to strike again.\u201cYoung Master Babel\u2014\u201d Babel\u2019s name made her pause. \u201cThey sparred. At that point, I knew it was mana. Their mana collided, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d Chiffon looked up stiffly. \u201cYoung Master Babel lost.\u201dChiffon took the Duchess\u2019s slap with closed eyes.\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\u201d The sounds of agony and anger shook the luxurious room.Joshua returned to his assigned room and collapsed onto the bed.It\u2019s difficult.\u00a0After his return, this was the first time he used mana in combat\u2014in\u00a0real\u00a0combat. There was a good reason for that, but\u2026\u00a0Even considering my age, this body is too weak.Joshua took a deep breath.This feels like hell.\u00a0His body was not trainable at this age. Was he not a bastard, thrown out of the mansion to clean horse dung for the rest of his life?I was too busy being bullied.\u00a0Even the word \u201ctraining\u201d was a luxury back then.Joshua had a sudden thought, and paused to mull over an earlier conversation.\u201cDid you say they were from Duke Pontier and Count Rebrecca? Those people, I mean.\u201dOddly enough, he and Cain seemed more familiar after the fight and spoke casually.\u201cYes, they are.\u201dThey were like rich people watching a chicken fight\u2026 disgusting\u2026It was true that the Pontier family was great, but\u2026 they would fall the same way as the Agnuses. The emperor would earn his nickname \u2013 the \u201cIron-Blooded Emperor\u201d \u2013 for none other than the Pontier family.It was a huge shock at the time. Wiping out an entire bloodline\u2014no less than a Ducal house, the highest of nobles\u2014down to its roots.\u00a0Afterwards, the Emperor announced it was for nothing but \u201ctreason against the Imperial family\u201d.Joshua didn\u2019t even know the exact story; he was too young at the time.Another memory came to him.The other girl \u2013 I remember she was not from the Duke\u2019s family. She was a high-ranked official, but not quite a Duke.\u00a0But Joshua was sure she was fallen nobility, because he had no memory of such an outstanding individual in the few descendents of the Fallen Dukes.Then there\u2019s only one option left.The house of Count Rebrecca\u2014a place Joshua had no memories of.Avalon Empire\u2019s first Seventh-Class Archmage; the Cold-Blooded Slayer; the Ice Flower\u2026\u201c...Iceline,\u201d Joshua muttered.In his past life, she didn\u2019t have a full name; it was said her name was buried with her family. They had no special relationship back then, but it was different now. This time, the more connections he had the easier it would be to achieve his goal.Thump! Thump! Thump!Suddenly, Joshua was roused by a knocking on his door. It was not a light knock\u2014it sounded almost like someone was kicking the door. Joshua opened the door right away.\u201cHi?\u201d Charles, a pretty girl with flaming red hair, smiled at Joshua. \u201cAre you Joshua von Agnus? Oh, do you know me?\u201dCharles powered through Joshua\u2019s stiff silence.\u201cI\u2019m Pontier \u2013 Charles de Pontier. I come from the fifth generation of the Ducal houses, same as you. I heard them say you\u2019re younger than me, so can I talk more comfortably?\u201d Charles paused her babbling to clasp Joshua\u2019s hands. \u201cAh! Well, I\u2019m not the kind of person who would discriminate against your mother because she\u2019s a concubine so don\u2019t worry. Well, feel free to call me \u2018sister\u2019.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cLet\u2019s go in and talk. I have a lot to say.\u201d With that, Charles strode into his room\u2014or would have, but Joshua quietly blocked the way.\u201cWhat? Let\u2019s talk!\u201d Charles gave Joshua a puzzled look.\u201cHey.\u201d His chilly voice made Charles flinch and tremble.\u201cGo away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Duke Agnus, gazing expressionlessly out the window, spoke quietly.\u201cLift your head. An Agnus should not look like that.\u201dBabel\u2019s eyes widened, and he slowly raised his head.\u201cWhy did you use mana?\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s gaze was unflinching.\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Babel stopped and bit his lip.\u201cDo you feel inferior?\u201dBabel\u2019s expression twisted.Inferiority complex? To that dung tosser? No way!\u00a0What was his father talking about now? Babel clenched his fists, digging his nails into his palms.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to admit it\u2014that I used mana.And the fact that he was pushed so far by that guy.It\u2019s just a coincidence. I don\u2019t know what trick you pulled, but if we meet again\u2026\u201cUnderstanding one\u2019s enemy is also a skill.\u201d Duke Agnus seemed to read Babel\u2019s innermost thoughts. \u201cBe strong. If your opponent is strong, be stronger. Be so strong that no one can make you kneel, not even the Nine Stars.\u201d\u201c\u2014Even more than the Duke?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Duke Agnus nodded firmly.\u201cCan I ask you one thing?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDuke\u2026 No, father\u2026 who am I to you?\u201dDuke Agnus gazed at him with a politely expressionless face. He didn\u2019t speak for a long while.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess?\u201d Cox discovered Charles was in a poor mood all day. While she wasn\u2019t a child, she was always full of energy; this was the first time anyone \u2013 even Cox, who had served her for so long \u2013 had seen her looking so dejected.\u201cGet out, Cox.\u201dCox hesitated at Charles\u2019s weak reply.What happened?\u00a0Charles frowned at Charles, who had buried her head into the bed.\u00a0Was it Joshua? I believe she saw him today.\u201cCox.\u201d\u201cOh, I see, Princess.\u201d Cox bowed his head and carried out his orders: to \u201cget out\u201d.I need to meet him at least once. If that boy really is a mana user, I must meet with him for my master.\u201cThen I will leave, Princess.\u201d Cox smiled bitterly at Charles\u2019s lack of reaction.The door shut behind Cox with a heavy thud.\u201cHaaahhhh\u2026\u201d Charles, head still buried in the pillows, sighed deeply. The memory of her encounter was still fresh on her mind.\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026\u201d she murmured. Given her usual personality, when she first heard him tell her to shut up and go, it was inevitable she would react wildly.I\u2019m the daughter of\u00a0the\u00a0Pontier family, for God\u2019s sake!But being treated like that for the first time didn\u2019t result in angry outbursts, raging emotions, or outrageous tantrums.Instead, it made her afraid.When I heard that voice, I thought my heart would stop.This boy had something special that young Charles had never experienced.\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026\u201d Charles squeezed her eyes shut.Everything became so boring. Her family\u2019s current situation\u2014what must she do?I just want to laze around here and rest.\u201cAnnoying.\u201dDuke Agnus was on his way out of the office, but halted. At the other end of the hallway, a woman was coming down the stairs.She bowed her head to the Duke. Duke Agnus approached with a measured gait \u2013 neither slow nor fast \u2013 and opened his mouth.\u201cIs the detached house good enough?\u201d\u201c...Yes, Duke,\u201d said Lucia, Joshua\u2019s mother.The Duke looked at Lucia, then to Chiffon, and back to Lucia.\u201cOkay.\u201d Duke Agnus quickly moved on. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d The two men walked past Lucia, whose head remained bowed. As he was in front of the Master, Chiffon did not neglect to offer Lucia a polite nod for formality\u2019s sake.\u201cIf you need anything\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus paused and spoke quietly. \u201cCome to me anytime.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d Lucia trembled.With that, Duke Agnus walked away with Chiffon in tow.\u201cChiffon, you are dismissed as well. I will train alone.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Chiffon saluted.\u201cAh! Please bring Joshua to my room.\u201d\u201cI heed and obey.\u201dChiffon stared at his departing back and frowned.\u201cNot good.\u201dJoshua slowly rose from the bed.He would take the entire Duchy.Was this an impulsive decision?Absolutely not.Before his return, the Avalon Empire was wracked by a second civil war. If the first civil war was the bloody battle between the First and Second Princes, the second civil war was nothing less than a battle of the Fourth Prince against all the other princes.The Fourth Prince, Kaiser von Britten, lurked in the shadows until the First Prince was weakened by the first civil war. In one fell swoop, the Fourth Prince stole away control of the Empire. It was only possible because he\u2019d positioned himself as the First Prince\u2019s trusted advisor.Of course, there were some who believed his tricks. Some nobles claimed to be neutral, refusing to weaken the Empire by slaughtering their own kin. Other nobles were eager to invade other nations and supported the Fourth Prince from the very beginning.Extraordinarily, Kaiser welcomed the First Prince\u2019s forces with open arms rather than purging them\u2014perhaps he was afraid of how his own forces would react.\u201cJust you wait, Kaiser.\u201d Joshua grinned savagely.The mighty forces of Kaiser von Britten\u2026In this life, I will personally crush you.Rather than ambushing a clueless Fourth Prince, Joshua would cut him down when his power was at its peak, and he was intoxicated by the thrill of victory. Only then could Joshua show him true despair.Knock, KnockJoshua was dragged back to reality.\u201cYoung Master. This is Chiffon, commander of the Red Knights.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door swung open.\u201cIt\u2019s time for your appointment with the Duke.\u201d Chiffon nodded politely.Joshua stood and followed Chiffon. No words were exchanged.Chiffon stopped on the third floor, in the innermost part of the mansion, and only then spoke to Joshua.\u201cHere we are. Only people permitted by the Duke may enter this place\u2026 I will now take my leave.\u201d Chiffon bowed his head and quietly stepped away, leaving Joshua to stare at the door.Finally, a place unknown to the people of the Duke of Agnus.He knocked.\u201cDuke, this is Joshua von Agnus.\u201d His full name felt awkward to say.\u201cCome in.\u201dAs he opened the door and entered the room, which was decorated only with the desk the Duke sat in.Aden von Agnus, Duke of the Avalon Empire, one of the Nine Stars, stared at him with a terribly flat expression.\u201cWho are you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joshua didn\u2019t avert his gaze.\u201cA lot of things have changed since I last saw you,\u201d he finally said.\u201cBecause a lot of time has passed.\u201dDuke Agnus could only smile bitterly.\u201cDo you resent me?\u201d\u201cI do not.\u201d Joshua answered without hesitation, to the Duke\u2019s surprise. \u201cYou expect nothing from anyone because you are watching the Imperial family.\u201dDuke Agnus visibly trembled.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice was low and sombre. \u201cBut I have a request.\u201d\u201cA request.\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI won\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry. Because in this place, might is right\u2014If you become stronger than me\u2026 Then, I will apologize.\u201dAn apology? I don\u2019t want such pleasantries.\u00a0In a world of savagery and cruelty, apologies were the privilege of apex predators. Anyone without strength would just be eaten.\u201cThe reason you called me here must be because you saw some potential in me. The Duke is someone who reaches out to the talented, regardless of their origins.\u201d\u201c...I won\u2019t deny it.\u201d The Duke eyed him questioningly.\u201cYou need to take me to the capital,\u201d he said quietly. Again, surprise flashed through Duke Agnus\u2019s eyes. The Duke waited for Joshua to elaborate, but no explanation was forthcoming.\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\u201cThere are two reasons.\u201d\u201cTwo?\u201d Duke Agnus leaned forward with genuine curiosity.\u201cFirstly, it is your responsibility as the head of the family to keep the family in order.\u201d Seeing Duke Agnus\u2019s silence, Joshua continued. \u201cEveryone here never doubted that you would be succeeded by Babel von Agnus. But suddenly, I appeared. Normally, you wouldn\u2019t even worry about someone who was ignored and despised for being a bastard.\u201dNow, Joshua\u2019s gaze sharpened.\u201cIt would be a different story if that boy had the skills to overcome the successor. The impoverished are slow to change their circumstances\u2026 yet here comes untold power. Anyone would be shaken.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you have that kind of power,\u201d Duke Agnus muttered.\u201cAt least\u2026\u201d Joshua ventured. \u201cI think it will be enough not to disappoint the Duke.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s lips curled upwards, ever so slightly. His eyes belied joy, a little anticipation\u2026 and a little regret.If I had raised him properly from the beginning\u2026\u00a0Duke Agnus swallowed his disappointment. It wasn\u2019t too late. Joshua was already a C-Class mana user at the age of nine. Just the fact that this unprecedented talent was here would make the Agnus name renowned throughout the continent.\u201cWhat is the second reason?\u201d\u201cSecond is\u2026 The Duke\u2019s personal greed for talent.\u201dThe Duke stared down at him.\u201cIf I achieve a level beyond even the Duke, your power will rise again. Maybe to the point where you don\u2019t need to watch out for the Imperial family.\u201d\u201cHoooh.\u201d After a while, Duke Agnus let out a low chuckle.It was a masterpiece.I thought he only had skills, but it turns out he also has guts.\u00a0His firstborn had talent that drew the envy of the entire Empire, but his mindset was lacking. But the progeny standing before him was perfect.Did this little boy really turn nine this year?\u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d Duke Agnus was taut with anticipation. \u201cI have a card that can solve both at once\u2026 Do you know what I know?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Joshua\u2019s immediate reply made the Duke\u2019s eyes light up.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of sending me to the academy in the capital.\u201dThat\u2019s right. But those two reasons aside, I also wanted to monitor him from nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible\u2014You know what I\u2019m going to say before I say it. I\u2019m at a loss for words.\u201dThe children of nobles in the Avalon Empire are obliged to attend the academy from the age of ten to fifteen \u2013 a period of six years. That said, with the right skills you could graduate early.Why did the Imperial family establish such an academy?The official reason was that their unique curriculum would foster outstanding talent, but only a fool would believe that. The Imperial family was holding the nobles\u2019 children hostage, binding the most talented children to the Imperial family.\u201cBabel has to leave the family next year, so it\u2019s not bad for you to stay up here\u2026\u201dFor similar reasons, noble children are required to travel the world for three years upon their sixteenth birthday. Nobles have few opportunities to experience the world at large, particularly if they\u2019re not called to war. However, most children would just take up residence with a suitable family and play around for three years.\u201cI think it would be best if you came to the capital along with me.\u201d Duke Agnus smiled bitterly. \u201cIf you\u2019re nearby, I can see you in person from time to time.\u201dWhat an incredible statement. A Master, of which there were only five in the Empire, and one of the Nine Stars, was saying he would personally teach him the sword. This opportunity couldn\u2019t be bought, no matter how much you offered\u2026\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Joshua shook his head resolutely.\u201cFine?\u201d Duke Agnus asked blankly.\u201cThe Duke is a master of the great sword. But I\u2026\u201d Joshua held out his hands. \u201cI intend to take up the spear.\u201d\u201cSpear?\u201d Duke Agnus frowned.I wondered if it was possible to win a spar using a stick\u2026\u00a0He never dreamed of such a thing. Nevertheless, the perception of the spear in Igrant was the worst.A crude weapon for untrained conscripts, nothing more and nothing less.Not a single spear-wielder stood in the vaunted ranks of the masters. Therefore, when Joshua beat back Babel with his stick, Duke Agnus firmly believed it was simply the result of Joshua\u2019s sophisticated understanding of mana.However\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Hackles raised, Duke Agnus reached out and clutched Joshua\u2019s head. \u201cWill you really use a spear?\u201dHis oppressive energy made it difficult to even open his mouth, but Joshua refused to back down. His boundless pride for the spear was more than a match for the Duke.\u201cMy\u2026\u201d Blood dripped from between his lips.\u201cMy spear will topple anything that stands in my way. Even\u2026\u201dJoshua locked eyes with Duke Agnus.\u201c...Even one of the Nine Stars.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the Nine Stars?\u201d Duke Agnus burst into laughter.Although... isn\u2019t this the same as what he said to Babel?Anyone with such ambition should speak through actions, not words. They have to produce results.\u00a0Another of his blood stood before him who could live up to such claims\u2014because Joshua was indeed a child of talent.But that weapon\u2026\u00a0Duke Agnus frowned, drumming his fingers against the desk.Everything else Joshua said was fine, but what was with his choice of weapon? He didn\u2019t even want a \u201cbig sword\u201d, which was nothing more than a form of bragging. Even if he\u2019d said he wanted an assassin\u2019s dagger, the Duke would have nodded along\u2014albeit reluctantly, because Duke Agnus firmly believed that the sword was the king of the battlefield. The spear, in contrast, was an insignificant weapon with more disadvantages than advantages.A longer reach?\u00a0The spear was unwieldy even for its size.After a long moment, the Duke seemed to reach a resolution.\u201cProve yourself worthy of the spear.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2014?\u201d\u201cI will test you.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes widened.Sparring? Again? It\u2019s not bad.\u00a0No, perhaps it could even be a good opportunity for Joshua; no matter what anyone said, Duke Agnus was one of the Nine Stars \u2013 a chance to prove his talent was a once in a lifetime bargain.\u201cDo you agree?\u201d Duke Agnus asked.\u201cYes; however, I\u2019d like to propose some conditions.\u201d\u201cConditions?\u201d\u201cIf I pass the Duke\u2019s test, I hope you will allow me another request.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus swallowed.\u00a0What the hell is he going to ask for?\u201cI will tell you my request after the test.\u201dThe Duke concluded that there was no point in protesting if Joshua would answer before he could raise an objection.\u201cFine. If you pass my test, I\u2019ll let you use the spear and hear out your request. However\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus scowled at Joshua. \u201cIf you lose, you obey my orders.\u201dIf Joshua was right, the Duke referred to accompanying him to the capital, in addition to learning the sword.Actually, going to the academy was not a bad option. What he needed most was time; it was better to go to the capital, where his safety was guaranteed, than stay here where wolves lurked around every corner.Most importantly\u2026 If I go to the capital, I will find him.Kaiser von Britten.\u2014And the many nobles who would become his subordinates in the future. Joshua had memorized every one.If I can contact them before he does\u2026 I\u2019ll have no reason to hide my skills.\u00a0People would flock to his power like bees to pollen.When I show them my skills, I can build a force using my own abilities \u2013 just like in my previous life. And the foolish young Kaiser von Britten will have his castle crumble beneath him without suspecting a thing. Thus, I will give him the greatest taste of despair in his entire life.\u201cAll right.\u201d Joshua's eyes blazed.\u201cHe\u2026 What did you say?\u201d Vanessa goggled at Chiffon.\u201cMaybe\u2026 I think the Duke will take Joshua to the capital.\u201d\u201cWhat? Arcadia?\u201d Vanessa frowned.\u201cIf\u2026 If Joshua\u2019s talent is real, you have to keep an eye on him a little longer. Undoubtedly, it was a terrifying talent\u2014\u201d Chiffon looked up and immediately clapped his mouth shut. The Duchess cast a murderous glare down at him, such that he struggled to finish his words.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 In any case, it could lead to a very difficult situation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware. Arcadia has too many eyes.\u201d\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Chiffon ventured.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI think the Duke is trying to spread the word that Joshua is a C-Class mana user.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still hearing that nonsense,\u201d Vaness frowned \u201cI thought it was a good idea\u2014\u201d\u201cI saw not only the Duke but also the two counts with my own two eyes. Even if it\u2019s not really mana, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re planning on testing the boy\u2026\u201d Vaness muttered.Any noble could appoint a \u201cknight\u201d, but it was a different story when it came to classifying them as a mana user. There was only one way to be officially recognized as a C-Class Knight in the Avalon Empire: to prove your achievement to the Imperial Knights.The Avalon Empire awards incentives to knights according to their Class; upon reaching B-Class, a knight would immediately be awarded a title and territories. In order to prevent such privileges from being indiscriminately squandered by the nobility, it was directly managed by the Imperial family.If you had the talent, you could contact the Imperial family first. When the Imperial family sees an incredible talent, they would stop at nothing to bring them to their side. Such a thing was only possible in the Avalon Empire, where the Imperial family always trumped the nobility.\u201cIn the past, it was sufficient to display mana to the Imperial Knights. But not anymore.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dChiffon nodded.\u201cDespite being recognized as a C-Class Knight, there were a lot of bluffers who could not wield mana properly.\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\u201cSo they fight to determine if they have the swordsmanship skills to suit their Class.\u201d\u201cSparring? With the Imperial Knights?\u201d Vanessa\u2019s eyes widened.The Imperial Knights.The Knights Templar, made up of over a thousand elite members, was without a doubt one of the most powerful martial forces in the Empire\u2014each and every one was C-Class or higher. In particular, the current commander of the Imperial Knights was one of only five A-Class Masters in the Empire; his skills were a match for anyone.\u201cIf we want to be tested as a C-Class, the Imperial family will probably send a C-Class Knight. Of course, the skills of a C-Class Knight can differ wildly.\u201dAn Imperial Knight who has trained extensively, and a knight who has just achieved C-Class; even if both were C-Class, the disparity was huge.\u201cOnly three\u2014\u201d Chiffon\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cI will test if he can withstand three of the Imperial Knights.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Vanessa nodded in understanding.\u201cThere used to be more nuance to it, but\u2026 Nowadays, the Imperial family seems concerned with how much mana they can hold\u2026 It can only mean that their standards have risen.\u201d\u201cTherefore\u2026 You\u2019re saying the Duke is going to invite the Imperial Knights to test the boy?\u201d Vanessa asked, frowning. Chiffon nodded.\u201cThe Duke values the honor of the family above all else. He wouldn\u2019t miss an opportunity like this.\u201d\u201cHow uninteresting.\u201d Vanessa bared her teeth. \u201cBabel should be enough, but if his eyes wander somewhere else\u2026 It disgusts me to see Babel being compared to a filthy maid\u2019s son, Sir Chiffon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I suggested this.\u201d Chiffon\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDoesn\u2019t royal blood flow through the Duchess as well?\u201dVanessa\u2019s eyes widened with realization.\u201cAfter all this time\u2026\u201d Her cold smile deepened. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call him again.\u201dJoshua paused as he was walking through the Duke\u2019s mansion. At the other end of the long passageway, he saw another person approaching.\u201cBabel?\u201d Joshua frowned. It was funny to see him try to challenge Joshua, but he didn\u2019t want to get involved.Their footsteps echoed down the empty hallway as they approached. Just as they were about to pass...\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d said Joshua.\u201cI\u2026 I cannot admit it\u2026 The fact that someone like you used mana, and the fact that you defeated me.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Joshua laughed.\u201cSo come at me.\u201dJoshua saw a fire in Babel\u2019s eyes. It was an emotion he knew all too well.Not vengeance, nor jealousy.A sense of victory.Pure passion.I never want to lose.Joshua\u2019s smile widened.\u201cGreat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time, Babel\u2019s sword wasn\u2019t wooden. His reflection shone clearly from the blade.\u201cThis is my very own training ground, so you don\u2019t have to worry about someone coming. Last time, we played games with those pathetic toys\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can wield my mana properly through a piece of wood. This time, I want to fight using a real sword.\u201d Babel shot Joshua a smug grin. The birds scattered from the trees around them, as if they could sense the danger in the air.\u201cIf you need a sword, I can lend you one\u2014\u201d Joshua interrupted him with a laugh.\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still crazy, Babel von Agnus. Pfft\u2014\u201d Babel scowled derisively at Joshua. \u201cWhen I saw the look in your eyes, I thought \u2018Did\u00a0it\u00a0happen again?\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Babel frowned.\u201cBabel von Agnus\u2026 treasure of the family.\u201d Joshua didn\u2019t bother hiding his smirk. \u201cYou think you can fool me with that pathetic act of yours? Your desire for victory is just an illusion! All you really want is to get your filthy mitts on the Duchy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Babel\u2019s face flushed red. This insult was a disgrace to his very name!Are you doing this for recognition?\u00a0Babel thought.You\u2019re dog shit, Joshua thought. The Duke\u2019s treasure and only heir; a C-Class Knight at the age of fourteen, renowned across the Empire. A person worthy of respect for just being\u2026 himself?Such trash\u2026\u201cNo more insults will be tolerated,\u201d Babel grunted, hefting his sword. \u201cTake up your weapon, Joshua.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need any weapons.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFor you, these fists are enough.\u201d Joshua raised his bare hands. \u201cLet me show you the difference between our talents.\u201dBabel\u2019s face burned unbelievably red.\u201cDie!\u201d Babel dashed towards Joshua. He wasted no time gathering his mana into a hazy mist around his sword.\u201cHaa!\u201d This time his swing was neat and efficient, unlike the ignorant movements he used before. Elementary, but powerful.When Joshua tilted to the side to avoid his attack, Babel calmly turned his sword towards Joshua\u2019s side. The sword hissed through the air. But\u2026He disappeared?\u00a0Babel couldn\u2019t hide his bewilderment.\u201cHere.\u201d Babel\u2019s head snapped downward.Pang! Babel\u2019s sword rang from the impact of Joshua\u2019s fist.\u201cHngh!\u201d Babel desperately clutched the hilt of his sword, which was rapidly becoming slick with his blood.So much power.\u00a0Cold sweat trickled down his back.Many knights considered losing their sword in battle a fate more shameful than death. As a result, they tended to treat hand-to-hand combat as a vulgar act for lowly mercenaries.\u201cI can tell what you\u2019re thinking just by looking at your expression.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou must have ignored the fundamentals of fistfighting, because it\u2019s \u2018just for sellswords\u2019?\u201d Babel flinched.\u201cFrom now on...\u201d Joshua clenched his fists. \u201cI will show you just how terrifying martial arts can be.\u201dThe spear technique Joshua learned encompassed more than just the spear. It detailed various techniques to subdue the enemy using his entire body.Joshua shot towards Babel.\u201cMa-Mana?\u201d Even in such a brief instant, Babel could see the energy in Joshua\u2019s fists.Mana in his bare fists! Infusing mana into the body should be exclusive to the Masters; the difficulty of simply applying mana to a medium, such as a sword, and directly to the body differed by an order of magnitude.\u201cHaah!\u201d Babel desperately swung at Joshua.The mana condensed on Joshua\u2019s fist exploded against the tip of Babel\u2019s sword. The training grounds shook from the detonation, louder even than the last time. Joshua had detonated his mana just before impact, doubling his effective power.The name of this technique was \u201cAura Explosion\u201d, and only Joshua could use it.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Babel tumbled away, head over heels. Blood dripped from his mouth, and his sword \u2013 which he\u2019d managed to keep his grip on \u2013 was bent at the tip.It was as if he\u2019d slammed his sword into a block of iron.\u201cDamn it.\u201d Babel slumped.I don\u2019t want to admit it, but I have to: this guy is a genius.\u00a0A genius incomparable to himself, who was already considered the best in the Empire.It was then that Babel understood how vast the sky was.\u201cAre you upset?\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice rattled his exhausted body.\u201cBe strong.\u201dI know these words.\u00a0Babel\u2019s eyes widened. He\u2019d heard the same thing from someone else not so long ago.\u00a0I need to be stronger\u2026?While Babel mulled over those words, Joshua continued:\u201cDon\u2019t forget this feeling. Don\u2019t forget how you were beaten down by someone using their bare fists\u2026 the fists you looked down on so much.\u201dI want to make an excuse, but nothing comes to mind.\u00a0In the end, he was the one who lost the battle.\u201cAccording to our agreement, one of your limbs was to be completely broken.\u201dBabel trembled.\u201cBut because I haven\u2019t seen a passion like that in a long time, I will let it slide this once.\u201d Babel heaved a sigh of relief; had he won, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated for an instant.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Joshua approached.\u201cTell me!\u201d Babel desperately heaved himself up. The pain of defeat twisted his stomach, but he managed to look Joshua in the eyes.\u201cIf you insult me or my mother again\u2026\u201d\u201c...I will make sure you never hold a sword again.\u201dFor the first time in his life, proud Babel felt fear.\u201cYou and me, right now\u2026 don\u2019t forget how I made you kneel.\u201d With that, Joshua walked away.To Babel, it seemed as if Joshua\u2019s back was larger than life.\u201cDamn it.\u201d His quiet murmur echoed in the empty training hall.One of the most secretive places in the Duchy was the Duchess\u2019s room.In the middle of Vanessa\u2019s room, a glowing orb of mana crystal sat on a wooden desk.A portable crystal ball like this one would cost incomprehensible quantities of riches. Even high-ranking nobles above the counts would struggle to acquire one. It was hardly a normal artifact, after all: these crystal orbs, developed by a Master, were worth tens of thousands of gold at a minimum \u2013 at that price, you could purchase any castle in the countryside.As the crystal ball brightened, a human figure became visible within.\u201cEverything is ready.\u201d The robed figure bowed deeply to Vaness before stepping back.\u201cUncle?\u201d\u201cOh, Vanessa. It\u2019s been a long time. Has the Duchy treated you well?\u201d\u201cI am always fine.\u201d Vanessa\u2019s lips drew into a deep smile. \u201cIs uncle doing well?\u201d\u201cWell, Arcadia is the same as always. The same boring routine, every day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Vanessa nodded along, but her eyes glittered with malice.Her next words were quiet, but heavy and cold like a snowstorm.\u201cUncle\u2026 I have something to ask you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three major powers in Igrant were the Avalon Empire, the Sallow Empire, and the Hubalt Empire.There were seven kingdoms, including the Magic Kingdom \u2018Terra\u2019. The weakest two were the Principality of Thran and the Heart Kingdom, which had been weakened by almost ten years of civil war.The three major powers constantly monitored each other, resulting in an unprecedented period of peace. But Igrant was a ticking time bomb\u2014if they continue to build power, it would inevitably explode. The only reason a war hadn\u2019t started yet was because they knew that taking the first step would put them at a disadvantage.The Avalon Empire was well known as a haven for knights; the Imperial capital, Arcadia, had an especially long history of supporting the knights. Since the knights were as vain as they were skilled, Arcadia was elaborately decorated to reflect their character.In particular, the grand Palace of the Avalon Empire stood as the tallest and grandest structure in the capital. The Galtika Palace was one of the most beautiful castles on the continent; its majestic walls seemed to reject the merely mundane.The owner of this palace was none other than the Iron-Blood Emperor, ruler of the Avalon Empire, Marcus von Britten.The Imperial Courtroom was simple, but exuded the elegance and pride of the knights from every stone. At the end of a luxurious red carpet was a gold-adorned throne, engraved with dragons, which were thought to represent ferocity and fortune, on either side.Normally, the courtroom was used for aristocrats to report on various policies and situations to the Emperor, but today it was so empty you could hear a chill draft whistling across the stones.On the throne sat the most important man in the Empire. Emperor Marcus von Britten slumped into his seat, chin resting on his fist.A man appeared, prostrating himself before the throne. He was clad in black from top to bottom; the mask dangling from the side of his face displayed his membership in the Imperial family\u2019s clandestine forces. Known as the \u201cBlack Wind\u201d, he headed an intelligence group which reported directly to Emperor Marcus. Of course, only the Emperor himself knew his true identity.\u201cBlack Wind\u201d stood straightened and began his report in an eerily monotonous voice.\u201cA warning has come from the Red Wyvern.\u201dEmperor Marcus\u2019s eyes snapped into focus.\u201cA child with the potential to become a star has appeared.\u201dThere was a long, pregnant pause.\u201c...If it\u2019s a \u2018Red Wyvern\u2019, it must be Duke Agnus?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cFrom the Ducal bloodline?\u201d Emperor Marcus\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cIf We\u00a01\u00a0remember correctly, there was already a child born and raised with half of our royal blood. Our sister is there\u2014\u201d\u201cReports say he descended from Duke Agnus, but not Babel von Agnus.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Surprise flickered across Emperor Marcus\u2019s normally implacable facade.\u201cDid the Duke have another child with Our sister?\u201d Emperor Marcus was incredulous. \u201cThis is the first We\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\u201cThat is... \u201c The man chose his words with care. \u201cI have heard it was not the Duchess\u2019s child.\u201d\u201c...A bastard?\u201d\u201cYes. It is said he was born from one of the Duke\u2019s maids.\u201d\u201cShe\u2026\u201d Emperor Marcus slumped back into the throne, exhausted. After a while, he burst out laughing.\u201cHow fun. That child is a treasure for the ages, and now he has two. We are truly envious.\u201d\u201cBut the princes are talented enough to make the world weep.\u201d\u201cWe disagree.\u201d Emperor Marcus shook his head quietly. \u201cObviously, there are a few with the qualities of an emperor. But in terms of strength, they\u2019re all lousy.\u201dThe man wanted to say something, but then shut his mouth. The general public would never evaluate the princes that way\u2014the Emperor, a Master, simply had absurdly high standards.\u201cIf the Duke decided to reveal his hidden card now, the boy must have had at least as much talent as that boy Babel?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2014\u201d The man pursed his lips. Again, he was hesitant to answer.I have no idea how I\u2019m even supposed to begin explaining this.Emperor Marcus\u2019s face stiffened with impatience.\u201c\u2014There are rumors that Babel von Agnus was defeated by the boy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Emperor Marcus couldn\u2019t hide his shock.Defeated? One of the best talents in Avalon, the Empire of Knights?\u201cTell Us in detail. Was he already an adult or something?\u201d\u201c...I believe he\u2019s nine years old this year.\u201dEmperor Marcus\u2019s mouth gaped open dumbly.There was no way the man would tell him such a lie unless he\u2019d gone insane. So\u2026 it must be true.\u201cIt is said Duke Agnus will request a dispatch of the Imperial Knights soon. In other words, it is assumed that the child is already approaching a C-Class Knight.\u201d\u201cAt the age of nine\u2026 Class C\u2026\u201dWouldn\u2019t it be really fun if it were true?Never in the entire continent\u2014nay, in all of history\u2014had this kind of talent appeared. Some would say that this was Duke Agnus\u2019s glory\u00a02, but it wasn\u2019t\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that this level of talent glorified the entire Empire.\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d A deep smile danced on Emperor Marcus\u2019s lips. \u201cThis is really fun. A nine year old bastard defeated the \u2018Duke\u2019s treasure\u2019, a C-Class Knight\u2026 Hmm\u2026 If he really defeated Babel, the boy\u2019s level is obvious. After all, it\u2019s impossible to defeat a mana user without using mana. Hahaha\u2026 You truly are the pride of the Empire.\u201dThe Emperor chuckled for a while more.\u201cJacken.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cIf you are born from lowly origins, there is a high chance you grew up disrespected by your family. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2014Yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Seeing the Emperor\u2019s look of anticipation, the man spat an answer immediately. Now was the time to tell him what he wanted to hear.\u201cThat means We have a chance, too.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s face clenched with worry.\u201cWe want to go there ourselves, but\u2026\u201dThe man was astonished.Did the Emperor really consider going out and finding the boy himself?Talk was easy, but the effects would be unimaginable. The Emperor\u00a0is\u00a0the Empire\u2014such a move was like the Empire itself bearing down on Duke Agnus.Emperor Marcus spoke before the man could.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity We can\u2019t because of the swarms of opportunists.\u201d The man breathed a sigh of relief. However\u2026\u201cSend Evergrant, Valmont, and one of the princes instead.\u201dThe man said \u201cFuck.\u201d and sighed heavily. The people the Emperor mentioned were the future of the Empire: Evergrant was the current chief mage and had passed the wall of the Seventh-Class; Valmont was one of the ten deputy knights, leading the 9th Battalion of the Knights Templar\u2014he\u2019d risen to his position at the tender age of twenty, and was frequently touted as the next commander of the order.\u201cYour Majes\u2014Your Majesty,\u201d the man stuttered, having just regained his senses. \u201cTo send one of the princes away\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you set the table, it\u2019s up to us to eat it.\u201d3\u00a0Emperor Marcus smiled bitterly, but hints of playfulness leaked through his serious demeanor. \u201cHas anyone else heard the rumors of this monster?\u201d\u201cOh, they probably don\u2019t know yet. Rumors will spread quickly, but right now, things are quiet even within the Duke\u2019s family\u2014\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s keep this a secret.\u201d Emperor Marcus\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cAn eye for talent is also a quality an emperor should have. There are only rumors of this child; the rest is up to them.\u201d\u201c...If none of the princes make a move\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, what, aren\u2019t these guys lucky? If that\u2019s the case, We will bring him here personally, in secret.\u201d\u201cI hear and obey.\u201d The man bowed his head and prostrated himself again.\u201cWe look forward to it. Hahahaha!\u201dThe royal We\u21a9Original said \u201cred robe\u201d, which I believe is a reference to the clothing of Korean royalty.\u21a9Slowly building the points for Joshua's recognition.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While old and well-worn, it was built to last.It was worth noting that all three floors were used for the same purpose. One floor contains private offices exclusively for the commander and vice-commanders of the Imperial Knights Templar; the widest room, in the middle, was the commander\u2019s office; to the sides were the offices of the vice-commanders in charge of the 1st through 10th battalions.There was an obvious reason for dedicating an entire floor to the senior leadership: inspiring pride in their duty, motivating them to constantly hone their skills.Maybe someday I will rise to that position, too.On the third floor, a young man lay on a sofa inside the 9th battalion office. He had flaming red hair that sparkled like fireworks, but his silver eyes were freezing cold. His visage was the epitome of indolence\u2014it seemed as if nothing could shake him from his laziness.\u201cThis is nice.\u201d The man stretched his legs out on the sofa.He\u2019d been stuck at the rank of 1st Lieutenant for a long time \u2013 and that was fine by him. His favorite pastime was avoiding his superiors\u2019 attention while he mooched around during work hours; after all, there was only one person in this building who was higher-ranked than him.The\u2014locked\u2014door swung open without warning.\u201c...You were here too.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d The man didn\u2019t bother sitting up, only turning his head towards the exhausted voice coming from the doorway.\u201cCommander?\u201d His eyes widened. There stood the only person who could give orders to anyone in the building: Rod den Hogg, the \u201cMaster\u201d, the commander of the Imperial Knights.The man begrudgingly heaved himself off the couch.\u201cWhat brings you here, Commander? If you had contacted me in advance, I would have come to see you in person.\u201d\u201cAre you going to talk back to me like a nerd?\u201d Knight-Commander Rod exasperatedly shook his head at the other man yawning and muttering.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. Please forgive me\u2026 I must\u2019ve lost my mind because I saw the person I truly admire.\u201cValmont, I see you\u2019re still running that deceitful mouth\u2026 I wish you would show your respect by actions sometimes, not empty words. You\u2019re not just a knight of the Knights Templar, you lead an entire battalion.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d Valmont flashed a playful smile.\u201cThen why are you here instead of training?\u201d Rod shot him a fierce glare, but didn\u2019t bother pressing the issue.I know nothing will change\u2014I\u2019ll just end up nagging him again. Valmont dun Brown, you\u2019ve always been like this.Valmont\u2019s talent was so overwhelming he sometimes made the Commander nervous, but Rod was confident that someone like Valmont was never going to take his place. Simply put, he was born lazier than a barnyard pig.To be promoted to deputy commander of the Imperial Knights, you must be at least a B-Class Knight \u2013 that is, at least an advanced expert. It was as if Valmont achieved this supreme state with half as much effort as anyone else.\u201cI feel this all the time\u2026 but somehow, medicine turned into a stick in the mud. Back then I was so proud, but one day\u2014\u201d\u201cChief, if I\u2019m a stick, doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m quite useful?\u201d Valmont pouted.Rod clenched his fists, sighed, and held out his right hand.\u201c...His Majesty\u2019s decree.\u201dValmont wiped the playful expression from his face.\u201cKneel and listen.\u201d Valmont quickly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. The golden dragon embossed on the seal parted, revealing the hidden contents.\u201c...Hear me, proud Ninth Commander. We wish to dispatch the Imperial Knights to the Agnus territories, at the behest of the Duke. We order you to depart in the company of the Imperial Chief Wizard Evergrant as soon as the equipment is prepared.\u201dEach word shocked him more than the last.One of the Duke\u2019s largest training halls, located in the most remote region of the Duke\u2019s mansion, was built solely for training the soldiers. Dozens of his centurions were gathered there.\u201cHey, did you hear?\u201d A soldier in light leather armor ventured.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe stable bastard\u2014No, the Duke\u2019s second young master!\u201d\u201cAh, that!\u201d The soldier next to him clapped his hands in apology.\u201cI heard he was actually a great talent? Rumor has it he even beat ogres with his bare hands?\u201d This came from a young soldier to his other side.\u201cHey! Even the knights would be mincemeat if they attacked an ogre with their bare hands. What is that child? Say something that makes sense\u2014\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t there even a rumor that the boy was already using mana?\u201d\u201cThis dumbass, really\u2026 You mean to tell me a bastard of less than ten years can become a mana user? What? Then I\u2019m a Master\u2014No, I\u2019m one of the Nine Stars!\u201dThe soldiers around them burst into laughter. Most of them dismissed the rumors as nonsense \u2013 they simply sounded too absurd to be true. Any reasonable person wouldn\u2019t believe it\u2014except\u2026\u201cHey Rols! Answer us! Where did Roid and Gort get off to?\u201d\u201cYeah, Rols! You said you\u2019re going to trash that Lucia girl! Didn\u2019t the three of you always bully that kid?\u201d\u201cWell, with that face and body, of course she\u2019s going to catch someone\u2019s eye\u2026 Ah, shoulda slept with that maid\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so small, you can barely get yourself off. It should be me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe centurions bantered on, but Rols couldn\u2019t say anything. After what he saw that day, Rols was quiet as if his tongue was cut off.\u201cYou\u2019re such weird bastards\u2026 I have no words.\u201d\u201cDid you really ravage Lucia, after all this time? Women of Lucia\u2019s age are hungry \u2013 I bet Rols was so small, Lucia was disappointed\u2014\u201d\u201cThis idiot talks with his crotch. When\u2019s the last time you got laid?\u201d Again, the centurions\u2019 laughter filled the hall.\u201cBy the way, who called us today?\u201d\u201cI think it was a Red Knight.\u201d At the mention of the Red Knights, Rols slumped and his eyes lost focus.\u201cThe Red Knights\u2026 Hahhh, it\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d\u201cDoes sparring take days or something? Let\u2019s just finish this quickly and go get a drink.\u201d All of the centurions wore a resigned expression.The centurions\u2019 training was unusual; they were expected to lead 100 soldiers, so they were directly trained by knights with command experience. The Duke\u2019s three great orders of knights took turns training them; among them, the Red Knights were famous for being the most difficult. Given their relative influence, the Red Knights worked the centurions hard to avoid being underestimated by the other orders.\u201cAttention!\u201d At the cry of the 1st Battalion leader, the most senior of the centurions, all of the centurions stood to attention.Small footsteps echoed in the silence.\u201c...Rols? Are you okay?\u201d Rols shuddered uncontrollably when he saw the knight arriving. The reaper of that day\u2014that terrible day\u2014appeared before him once more\u2026\u201cHmm? Why did the knight bring a child with him?\u201d\u201cWait. Isn\u2019t that the kid from the stable? Why is Lucia\u2019s kid\u2014\u201dRols, rattled by each passing word, managed to slowly raise his head. He met someone\u2019s eyes and groaned.\u201cYoung master\u2026 Joshua.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, today\u2019s training will be useful to you.\u201d Cain, clad in iron plate engraved with the symbol of the Red Knights, looked around.Why is a Knight of the Red using honorifics for such a child?\u00a0The centurions\u2019 ranks rippled.\u201cI am Joshua von Agnus.\u201d\u201c...Hey, that kid\u2014\u201dJoshua could hear the centurions muttering, but continued.\u201cEveryone here is a loyal servant of the Duke, yes?\u201dThe silence was suffocating.\u201cYour skills are probably good, if not great.\u201d He looked around, eyes lingering on Rols. \u201cAll of you\u2026 come at me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even Cain was wide-eyed\u2014he\u2019d never imagined that Joshua would try to take on all the centurions at once.\u201cAre\u2026 Are you serious, Young Master?\u201d\u201cYou may get hurt. We are the elite, the centurions of Duke Agnus!\u201d\u201cRight! No matter how great your blood is, this is an insult to all of us!\u201dJoshua smiled menacingly at the centurions.\u00a0They looked like they were about to run away with their tails between their legs.\u201cDo you think so too?\u201d Joshua fixed his gaze on one face.Rols immediately had the attention of everyone around him.\u201cY-young Master\u2014\u201d Cold sweat beaded on his forehead.\u201cOh, it seems you never told your dear colleagues about our conversation earlier.\u201d Joshua\u2019s words turned the air frigid. Only a cold gust of wind stirred in the deafening silence.\u201cThat\u2014 that\u2014\u201d Rols wanted to make an excuse, be he couldn\u2019t even form a proper sentence.I watched two of my colleagues die before my eyes. How was I supposed to tell them I was humiliated by a dung shoveler?\u00a0None of the Duke\u2019s soldiers, certainly not the centurions, would have believed it; they would have thought Rols and his friends were just trying to monopolize Lucia.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry!\u201d\u201cOne chance is enough. Two would be too much.\u201dRols trembled like a reed in the wind and collapsed onto the floor.The centurions watching on noticed a pole protruding from behind Joshua\u2019s back.\u201c...Spear?\u201d A soldier quickly identified the identity of the object. A spear, a common implement of soldiers. At the very least, it wasn\u2019t just some metal stuck to the end of a stick; it was an iron spear that anyone present could have taken on a whim.Joshua twirled the spear, sending a gust of air whistling past the centurions. The sight of a child swinging a spear so easily was quite strange\u2014even as an adult, it was not easy to adjust to the weight of a weapon like that.The centurions could only watch in silence as Joshua paced forward and slammed his spear in the ground before Rols.\u201cYou will die here. You should have died when you insulted my mother, but you squandered that chance. So now you die\u2026 Just like your colleagues did.\u201dThe other centurions were not entirely surprised. Rumors abounded about Roid and Gort\u2019s absence; from stories about retiring to their hometowns, to secret missions, every sort of story was tossed about but nothing was proven.If Joshua was believed, then Roid and Gort were not spared the Young master\u2019s wrath.\u201cOne more chance, Young master! All I need is one more chance!\u201d Rols desperately smashed his head against the ground.I don\u2019t want to die like this.\u00a0Rols had only just become a centurion; he didn\u2019t want to die without enjoying the privileges of his rank.\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d\u201cAs I said before: I won\u2019t give you a second chance.\u201d Joshua glared down at Rols.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Joshua hefted his spear. \u201cI have no desire to trample on the pride of a Duke\u2019s centurion.\u201dRols nervously met Joshua\u2019s eyes.\u201cTake up your weapon. As a centurion of Duke Agnus, defend what little pride you have left.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you beat me\u2026\u201d Joshua huffed and whipped his spear around. \u201c...Then I will spare your life.\u201d\u201cTry your best to kill me. You die, you lose. I die, well\u2026 Imagine the fame!\u201dIf this is how I die, I\u2019ll go out with a bang.Rols had thought the feeling of fear he had felt last time was because of Cain\u2019s overwhelming presence, but now, looking at Joshua, his nerves ran cold and his muscles were stiff as stone.But he sighed and stood. He had to fight and fight well.The sword he unsheathed was surprisingly sharp and well maintained.\u201cThat sword does not suit its master.\u201dJoshua pointed the tip of his spear at Rols. He wanted to use Lugia\u2014rod or not\u2014but in this kind of place, using the same weapons as a soldier would maximize the intimidation factor. From his previous battles, he knew there would be no problem using his power for a time even when he was separated from Lugia.Everything was calculated.\u201cCome.\u201dRols bit his lip hard enough to make it bleed, staring at the boy in front of him\u2014was it just an illusion, or had the small boy gotten bigger?\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d Rols rushed in with a mad scream; the shining tip of his sword threatened to skewer Joshua\u2019s small body at any moment. Joshua merely smiled and raised his spear high.\u201cUh, what do you think?\u201d The surrounding soldiers began to murmur.\u201cHave you ever heard of using a spear in that position?\u201d\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t see them anymore.Joshua fully displayed the dignity of a Duke\u2019s son, but he was shovelling horse shit out of the stables not long ago. Rols, on the other hand, was a powerful man who was promoted to centurion at a relatively young age. No one doubted he would be run through by Rols\u2019s sword any moment now.Furthermore, the spear is a weapon specialized in stabbing attacks to maximize its long reach; raising your spear left you vulnerable below, and only a fool would attempt a slash\u2014compared to the long shaft, the spearhead was only about as long as two adult fists.Easy target!\u00a0Rols\u2019s sword cut sharply towards Joshua. Some of the centurions shut their eyes, believing they were about to witness the death of the Duke\u2019s own blood.But then, Joshua brought his spear down. It was a relatively slow movement, but it had a ponderous weight to it.The first method: Thundering Strike.\u00a01The first stage of the spear technique contained only two methods, including Thundering Strike.Just like the second method, it was a very simple movement \u2013 up and down \u2013 but it contained the power of a mountain.Mana gathered at the pinpoint tip of the spear, resonating faintly.\u201cHahh.\u201d For a moment, the swish of the spear sounded like thunder.Time seemed to freeze\u2014\u2014Rols\u2019s sword was split down its length, and fell to the floor.\u2014Dark red blood splattered forth, staining Joshua.And with a thump, Rols fell to the ground.In two pieces.Joshua slammed the butt of his spear back onto the floor. You could hear a pin drop in the resulting silence.\u201cI am the blood of Duke Agnus. I am Joshua von Agnus. If you have mastered the sword, speak with your skill not your mouth. On the battlefield, judging your opponents by their appearance alone will cost you your life.\u201dA middle-aged man, probably a senior centurion, knelt on the ground.\u201cMay glory follow wherever you walk! I greet Prince Joshua, blood of the Grand Duke!\u201dWas this the trigger? All of the centurions, without exception, dropped to their knees.\u201cWe greet you!\u201dBefore them stood only Joshua.Also\u2026\u00a0Cain had stepped back with a faint smile. His senses were not wrong.\u00a0With this, Young Master Joshua has gained the honor of his mother and the trust of the soldiers in one fell swoop.It may be a temporary trust, gained through fear, but there was no surer method for their first meeting.Maybe, really\u2026\u00a0It felt like that little boy\u2014nay, his master\u2014could really make his dream come true.I will do my best to serve you...\u00a0Cain\u2019s smile deepened as he gazed upon Joshua\u2019s proud back....Master.Originally \u201cIts momentum will be like thunder\u201d. Manhwa went with \u201cLightning Strike\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t make sense with the extra context in the novel.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEarly in the morning was the busiest time in the outer walls of the palace. Within these majestic edifices, almost a hundred armored men clamored; they exuded the knights\u2019 pride with every movement.At first glance, it seemed to be a lot of people; but looking closer, you would see that it was actually a very small percentage of the Imperial Knights. Numbers were not everything, of course\u2014each one of them was more capable than a hundred men combined.This group of knights and wizards was preparing to depart for Duke Agnus\u2019s territories. Leading them was a small, fair-skinned, middle-aged man with platinum blonde hair, draped in a white robe; his emerald green eyes glittered brightly and seemed as if they peered into peoples\u2019 hearts, and his gaze was cold and imperturbable. He was one of the most powerful wizards in Avalon: the Imperial Chief Wizard, Evergrant von Aswald.His five aides clustered around him with worried expressions.\u201cChief, are the rumors from the Agnus Duchy true?\u201dEvergrant paused for a moment before replying.\u201cTrue or not, we are wizards. It\u2019s our duty to follow orders and remain unbiased\u2026 Until we see it with our own eyes, we have to assume it\u2019s true.\u201d In addition to his remarkably gentle personality, Evergrant was well known for the polite way he addressed his subordinates. This, along with his knowledge, won him the respect of those under him.\u201cThis is nonsense. If anyone told me he mastered 2nd-Class at the age of nine, I wouldn\u2019t believe it either\u2026 Didn\u2019t Miss Rebrecca enter the 2nd-Class at that age as well?\u201dIf a child responds to mana for the first time around the age of ten, they are dubbed a prospective wizard. Iceline, on the other hand, had mastered the 1st-Class and already entered the 2nd-Class. She was known as one of the continent\u2019s greatest magical talents, and rightfully so.Unlike swordsmanship, which can be developed by pure effort, magic and sorcery depend entirely on innate talent. As such, the ratio of knights and wizards was heavily skewed\u2014there were only a few wizards in the entire Empire.That said, knights who can infuse mana into the sword \u2013 so-called \u201cmana user\u201d or \u201chigher level\u201d knights \u2013 were just as rare as wizards.\u201cOnce a knight can wield mana, even a 2nd-Class wizard struggles to defeat them. By that logic, 2nd-Class wizards will kneel to\u2026 a nine year old child.\u201d\u201cWe have to be thorough with our judgement. But if the rumors are true, that kind of talent\u2026\u201d Evergrant\u2019s words were muffled, but the other wizard shook his head.\u201cI am worried. In our beloved Avalon, the gap between knights and wizards is widening\u2026\u201dEvergrant\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cIf the rumors are true, I think we should convince him by any means necessary. But if that fails\u2014\u201d\u201cThat boy is a talent His Majesty ordered us to watch. Don\u2019t think about such nonsense.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d The wizard immediately backed down for Evergrant.\u201cSir Valmont, are the preparations complete?\u201d Evergrant called out to the young knight approaching them.\u201cWell, as you can see it\u2019s going smoothly.\u201d The commander of the 9th Battalion tilted his head and shrugged. His laziness kicked in at the wrong moment.\u201cThis is for His Majesty and the glory of the Empire,\u201d Evergrant scoffed. \u201cI expect you will leave no room for error\u2014not now, not ever.\u201d\u201cHah, how many useless worries do you wizards have?\u201d Valmont was careful to keep his voice too low to be heard.Evergrant was not a noble\u2014instead, his rank was based entirely on relationships. The favor of the Emperor won him his position as Chief Wizard and treatment better than any high-ranking nobleman. To put it bluntly, Evergrant outranked Valmont in every way.In the Avalon Empire, the land of knights, wizards were known as a tool of convenience. Valmont, an Avalon knight down to the bone, used to ignore wizards outright. But Evergrant was a wizard at the beginning of the 6th-Class; even in the Empire, he wielded considerable influence.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to act like this the entire mission, I\u2019ll have no choice but to report it directly to His Majesty.\u201d The mention of \u201cHis Majesty\u201d made Valmont tremble.Evergrant and Valmont glared at each other. The bizarre confrontation gathered the attention of the thirty wizards and one hundred knights around them\u2014it looked as if a fight would break out at any moment.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s ajoke.\u201d Valmont lifted both hands with a friendly smile. \u201cCan\u2019t you take a joke, Chief Wizard? Ahh, it\u2019s so boring. No one has a sense of humor\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax, wizard.\u201d Valmont patted Evergrant\u2019s shoulder on the way out. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready~\u201d\u201cThat damn bastard!\u201d One of the wizards stamped his foot.\u201cHalt. It\u2019s already done.\u201d\u201cBut Chief Wizard\u2014!\u201dEvergrant shook his head, and the wizard could only bite his lip and back down again.The knights gathered were not aware of the true power of the wizards. In this era of peace, the knights were used to one-on-one battles where their well-trained bodies would not give a wizard the time to harness their mana.In war, wizards truly shined\u2014but in these peaceful times, there was no way a war would happen.If they knew what I was thinking, they would be furious.Valmont laughed so hard he choked. The knights standing nearby had to bite their lips to stifle their laughter.The angry wizard\u2019s nails dug deeply into his palms. Valmont smirked at him.\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s orders were to send all one hundred knights of the 9th Battalion, including me, to represent the Imperial Knights Templar. The Chief Wizard was well are of this, and he knew there were ten intermediate B-Class, thirty lower B-Class, and numerous C-Class in the battalion.\u201d\u2026And you\u2019re probably as old as my uncle.\u00a0Valmont almost added insult to injury, but decided to wrap it up.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Evergrant swallowed nervously.\u00a0I already knew it, but it\u2019s something else to hear and see it in person.With those numbers, the 9th Battalion could take on all the knights in the Empire outside of the Knights Templar. Within the Empire, there were only a few known A-Class; below them were no more than fifty B-Class.\u201cThe fact that His Majesty deployed an entire battalion\u2014\u201d\u201cIt means,\u201d Valmont interrupted, \u201cthat one of the princes is going on this expedition.\u201dThe crowd was instantly abuzz.\u201cA prince? A prince is coming with us?!\u201d\u201cThis is even weirder! No matter how talented that Agnus child is, how could they dispatch a whole battalion and a prince? It\u2019s just a bit of mana!\u201d\u201cAnd the battalion commander and Chief Wizard together? With this kind of power, no one in the Empire will stand in our way.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s life.\u201dValmont frowned and raised his hand to silence the crowd.\u201cDo you know which prince is coming?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I did not hear anything else from His Majesty. Matters of the Imperial family are top-secret and totally classified until just before the mission.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Valmont swallowed a sigh. \u201cThat aside, are you already aware of why we\u2019re going to the Agnus duchy, Wizard Evergrant?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the rising star of the Agnus family?\u201d\u201cThe rising star?\u201d Valmont\u2019s eyebrows twitched and his anger rose sharply. Evergrant\u2019s choice of words was provocative: anyone who deserved to be called a \u201crising star\u201d had the potential to challenge the Nine Stars. Babel von Agnus was a \u201crising star\u201d because he became a C-Class Knight at the age of fourteen.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe such nonsense, do you?\u201d\u201cWhen Young Master Babel became the youngest mana user in the Duchy, everyone reacted the same way.\u201d Evergrant shrugged it off.\u201cDo you know the second youngest mana user in the Agnus family?!\u201d By this point, Valmont was shouting. \u201cDuke Agnus wielded mana at sixteen! If you\u2019re born from that lineage, fourteen years old just barely makes sense\u2014but this kid! A commoner, a nine-year-old born from a maid!\u201dEven if the Duke is to be believed, it\u2019s the duty of an Imperial Knight to keep the high-ranking nobles in check on behalf of His Majesty. Even for the Grand Duke Agnus, there\u2019s something fishy about this incident\u2026Normally, Valmont was endlessly fickle. But now, he had no intention of ignoring this potential threat: if this peace was broken, he was doomed.The shame\u2026 Evergrant clenched his fists. An Archmage on the verge of entering the 7th-Class, the Realm of Demons.\u00a0No where else would I receive this kind of ridiculous treatment\u2014if not for the Emperor, I would have left right away. But in the near future, everything will change. And\u2026Evergrant stared coldly at Valmont.This staid peace will soon come to an end. When that time comes\u2026\u201cLord Valmont; Sir Evergrant; what are you talking about that\u2019s so amusing?\u201d One of the palace gates burst open, revealing a small boy flanked by two knights.\u201cPrince!\u201d The two men knelt before the boy with golden eyes and golden hair\u2014without a doubt, a scion of the Imperial family.\u201cYeah, did you say the kid\u2019s name was Joshua?\u201d\u201cYes, Prince Kaiser.\u201dOver a hundred knights and sorcerers were graced by Kaiser\u2019s dazzling smile.\u201cJoshua\u2026 Joshua von Agnus\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The older of the two was, of course, Duke Agnus, lord of the duchy and commander of legions; The other was Joshua, a young boy with flushed ears. The thick soundproofing allowed no sounds inside to interrupt their terse silence.\u201cI received some reports\u2026\u201d The Duke heaved a sigh and drummed his fingers against the table. \u201c...that said you requested a sparring session \u2013 no, more of a showcase \u2013 with the soldiers. And, hahh, some lives have been lost.\u201dAny ordinary person would find it mentally taxing to just look at the Duke right now. Behind his mild tone and stoic expression, he could be hiding a blistering rage.The Duke must be uncomfortable with a child wielding such power.\u00a0Joshua didn\u2019t miss the disappointment in the Duke\u2019s eyes\u2014he knew he had to reply, and fast.\u201cYes. But my actions were fair and just. They were executed for slandering the nobility.\u201d\u201cSlander?\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s frown creased his forehead.\u201cThat soldier disrespected my mother. According to military law, a soldier who insults the nobility should be immediately executed.\u201dDuke Agnus knew that, of course. He knew everything that happened in the Duchy. But when he found out, the first thing he felt was anger.I don\u2019t think he did the wrong thing.\u00a0Were the Duke in the same situation, he would have cut the soldier\u2019s head off with a single strike.\u00a0But what a pity.In Duke Agnus\u2019s opinion, Joshua mishandled the issue. While his actions were technically correct, soldiers were still human beings. From their point of view, a summary execution could be seen as a disregard for their lives; considering Joshua\u2019s age, they would think their lives could end because of a child\u2019s tantrum.Most of all, the Duke was unhappy that Joshua hadn\u2019t discussed it with him.\u201cDo you think it was just a child\u2019s tantrum?\u201dJoshua didn\u2019t miss the Duke\u2019s surprise.I have no intention of throwing away the favor I\u2019ve accumulated.\u201cHe insulted my mother\u2026 but no, that wasn\u2019t the only reason.\u201d\u201cThere were others?\u201dWhy would he do something that would obviously antagonize the soldiers?\u201cIf that was the only reason, there would be no reason to do it in front of all the other centurions.\u201dIt has to do with the Duke, too.\u00a0Duke Agnus was a decisive factor in Joshua\u2019s childish reputation, after all.\u201cI have two reasons. One is to make the soldiers treat my mother properly. Second\u2014\u201d Joshua savored the words on the tip of his tongue. He\u2019d been looking forward to this moment for quite a while now. \u201c\u2014to stabilize my position in the Duchy.\u201d\u201cThe soldiers know me as a dung shoveler. After all that, they\u2019d struggle to respect me no matter what skills I had. That is to say, the only way to make them respect me was to make them fear me.\u201dDuke Agnus gaped at him.\u201cI do not intend to sit still and make concessions because of my origins. I was also born from the Grand Duke\u2019s bloodline.\u201dThe Agnus bloodline begets great ambition and skill to match.\u00a0Truly, these were the qualities of monarchs and conquerors. His eyes were never wrong.Duke Agnus couldn\u2019t control his twitching lips anymore and a chuckle rolled from his lips. When he\u2019d returned to his hometown, exhausted from his stagnant life, he\u2019d had no idea such a great gift was waiting for him.How delightful.\u201cThey say the Imperial family will send someone in tomorrow. To evaluate your mana, of course.\u201d\u201cI heard.\u201dDuke Agnus paused to examine Joshua. The boy was like a deep ocean, quiet but dangerous \u2013 he was clearly the Duke\u2019s child, but he had no idea what went on in his head.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my bias speaking, but\u2026 you seem to have changed.\u201dHave I changed?\u00a0Joshua kept his expression politely blank.As a child, there was no interaction between them at all. The relationship between the high and the low was more distant than any other family.But neither of them would say that out loud.\u201cThey say humans are adaptable creatures.\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice was practically a whisper. \u201cAn animal will adapt, or it will die.\u201d\u201cThat is true\u2014\u201d\u201cAnd!\u201d Joshua pursed his lips. \u201cDoubly so for me.\u201dWas there ever an Agnus with such a desperate heart?\u00a0Duke Agnus was astonished.\u00a0Could their environment really change a person like this?The tense silence was broken by Duke Agnus\u2019s laughter.\u201cIt really is amusing. Let us see if you become the apex predator in this \u2018environment\u2019.\u201dDuke Agnus leaned forward.\u201cI received a message from the Imperial family not long ago. It seems this mana evaluation expedition is quite unusual\u2026 possibly because of you.\u201d Duke Agnus thrust his finger at Joshua. \u201cPerhaps because it was a nine year old\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are planning to take me for the Imperial family\u2026\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cYou may have attracted that level of curiosity.\u201dThe Duke lifted a piece of paper off the table. It was embossed with the seal of a roaring golden dragon\u2014a missive directly from the Imperial family.\u201cIt says that the entirety of the 9th Battalion of the Imperial Knights will be dispatched on this expedition \u2013 including the battalion commander.\u201dIn general, only two or three Imperial knights would be dispatched to a noble\u2019s request. Depending on the talent and influence of the family, the numbers of the expedition increased but there was never1\u00a0a case where an entire battalion was dispatched like this. Even when Babel von Agnus, the \u201ctreasure of the Empire\u201d, was tested, only a platoon of ten was dispatched.\u201cNo matter how talented you are, doesn\u2019t the size of the dispatch make you curious? The Emperor could just call you directly to Arcadia. Besides which, it\u2019s being led by the battalion commander himself. Valmont, that\u00a0friend.\u201dJoshua\u2019s face flickered with suspicion. Despite being a battalion commander, the name \u201cValmont\u201d wasn\u2019t familiar to him.He might be using a pseudonym. If not, he disappeared before I had a chance to meet him\u2026 such as in the civil war.\u201cAnd the Imperial Chief Wizard will be accompanying them as well.\u201dJoshua froze.The current Imperial Chief Wizard\u2026?\u00a0If his memory could be trusted, there was only one possibility.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of him\u2014he\u2019s greatly favored by His Majesty the Emperor. His name is\u2014\u201d\u201cEvergrant.\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice hissed like a winter storm.\u201cEvergrant von Aswald.\u201dNever/Rarely (Not really sure)\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His mental and physical exhaustion mixed together to form a weird, roiling sensation.\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m really tired,\u201d he muttered, capitulating to the sleep god.The events of earlier danced through his mind.My own father\u2026 The Duke\u2019s words seemed to capture his heart in a jar. It was not a pleasant feeling.\u201cThe archmage Evergrant, yes\u2026 He will be here, along with a member of the royal family. Rest assured it won\u2019t be the Emperor, but the identity of the royal in question won\u2019t be revealed until just before their arrival \u2013 for security, I heard.\u201dBut for some reason, I have an ominous feeling that the incoming royal is someone I know very well.\u201cIf it\u2019s really Evergrant and\u00a0him\u2014\u201d Joshua gnawed on his lip. The worry pooled into his stomach; he worried if he could control himself if they met face to face. As of now, he couldn\u2019t even touch a hair on Evergrant\u2019s head.Let\u2019s not be hasty.\u00a0The revenge he was after wasn\u2019t inflicting harm on a young, foolish boy, even if he got Evergrant too.Don\u2019t let your thirst for revenge cloud your judgment, Joshua!When you stand at the top, drunk with that pitiful euphoria you call \u201cvictory\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d, that\u2019s when my spear will find you. Just you wait.\u201cHaha\u2026 Even your name tastes bitter, Kaiser von Britten.\u201dThe Imperial Knights of the Avalon Empire, the roaring golden dragon, were hand-picked by the wise Emperor Marcus. He was very particular about their abilities; when it came to the Knights Templar, noble titles were nothing more than words on paper. From the moment you joined the Imperial Knights you were told to throw your titles out the window, because everyone was a potential master there.The only thing you need? Your skills. If you were skilled enough, even a knight from a baron\u2019s family could outrank the sons of dukes.Within the Imperial Knights\u2019 headquarters a clandestine conversation was taking place in the 1st Battalion office.\u201cAre the preparations going well?\u201d The blonde, middle-aged man with a neat mustache and a noble visage was Joker, the commander of the 1st Battalion.\u201cOf course.\u201dThe young man who answered had the number 9 engraved on his shield, and the number 2 engraved on the dragon\u2019s head, indicating he was the second strongest in the 9th Battalion.\u201cI got a call from\u00a0him.\u201dThe young man shivered.\u201c\u2014Is this your mission?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 the purpose of this dispatch is ot ensure that the young master of Agnus will not be able to hold a sword again for the rest of his life\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2014It\u2019s because of Vanessa. None other than his\u2014\u201d Goosebumps ran up the younger man\u2019s skin and he snapped his mouth shut.\u201cRemember where you are\u2026 Watch your tongue.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dMurderous thoughts danced wildly in Joker\u2019s eyes.\u201cRumors have already reached his ears. The rumors that, in the duchy, an undisputed genius has surfaced that can even surpass Babel von Agnus. It would be perfect if he could be made to kneel, but that\u2019s impossible considering he\u2019s an Agnus.\u00a0He\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to leave any seeds that could grow into trouble in the future.\u201d\u201cYes. It would be better to trample such weeds before they grow.\u201d The young man rose from his seat and saluted.That shouldn't have happened.It goes without saying that Joker was highly respected because he commanded the strongest battalion, but the Knights only saluted their direct superiors. That meant the Master of the Knights, Rod den Hogg, and the commanders of their own battalion. By decree of the Emperor himself, it was taboo to salute a knight from a different battalion in order to foster a fierce competitive spirit.\u201cI will now take my leave.\u201d\u201cI trust there won\u2019t be any mistakes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dPitiful as it seemed, the young man\u2019s face bore a deep and painful scar.The next morning, the Duke\u2019s men assembled before the master of the house. Duke Agnus was flanked on both sides by two of his commanders, including Chiffon.\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d Chiffon glanced out the front door.A troop could be seen in the distance, moving at speed; the golden dragon and the number 9 emblazoned on their gear clearly displayed their identity.\u201cAt that size\u2026 it seems that the entire battalion really came, as the Imperial family said\u2026 That person in the pure white robe at the front is\u2014\u201d\u201cEvergrant.\u201d\u201cCertainly, he seems to have attracted a lot of attention from the Imperial family. After all, he wields mana at nine years old.\u201d The middle-aged man to the Duke\u2019s right side opened his mouth this time. He was Armstrong, commander of the Duke\u2019s finest men: the Golden Man Corps.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus chuckled. \u201cIs that really all?\u201d\u201c\u2014Yes?\u201d Armstrong turned to follow Duke Agnus\u2019s gaze.\u201cThat boy?\u201d\u201cA Britten\u2014\u201d\u201cBy that, you mean\u2026 a prince?\u201d Everyone except the Duke was agape.\u201cThe Fourth Prince\u2026 Kaiser.\u201d\u201cMy God. My God.\u201d Armstrong\u2019s jaw twitched.Only Chiffon maintained his composure.\u201cThis is clearly discrimination! How is the Young Master to overcome the pressure of the entire battalion and the Chief Mage?\u201d Armstrong was the first to come to his senses. \u201cI am concerned he will be too nervous and he\u2019ll make a mistake in front of the prince.\u201dArmstrong\u2019s concerns were understandable. Joshua\u2019s mistake could affect the entirety of the Agnus duchy.\u201cWhat do you think, Joshua?\u201dTo Armstrong\u2019s astonishment, Joshua strode out of the ranks of the knights. The shimmer of his deep blue hair and his well-oiled leather armor were a perfect match.Joshua took in the gazes of Duke Agnus and his commanders and smirked. Contrary to his own expectations, the rage Joshua felt from seeing Kaiser had frozen solid.I don\u2019t have the strength to hurt them right now. My revenge will wait, Evergrant and Kaiser.Joshua came up to Duke Agnus\u2019s side.\u201cThe Imperial household\u2026\u201d Joshua basked in the expectations of the crowd. \u201c...will forever remember the Agnus name.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His courtesy was neither excessive nor insufficient.\u201cI am honored to meet Duke Agnus, the pride of the Empire.\u201d Kaiser stepped down from his horse.The audience was dumbfounded when Prince Kaiser bowed his head with a gentle smile.\u201cPrince!\u201d An embarrassed Evergrant shouted. No matter how high-ranking an aristocrat was, the fourth prince was a direct descendent of the Emperor himself, in an age where the Imperial family had never been stronger.It was said that nobles treat dukes and princes much the same, but for a prince to treat a duke as a peer was uncalled for.\u201cNot only the Imperial Knights, but the Duke\u2019s family are watching. The Prince\u2019s actions could undermine the authority of the Imperial family\u2026\u201d Evergrant whispered worriedly into Kaiser\u2019s ear. His voice was small, but most of the knights\u2014including Duke Agnus\u2014had superhuman hearing. Curiosity twinkled in the Duke\u2019s eyes.\u201cAs a powerless fourth prince, if I have to posture in a situation like this I\u2019ll spend my life being ridiculed.\u201d Kaiser smiled at the Duke.The Duke was subtly surprised. He wasn\u2019t wrong\u2014the first and second princes had the greatest influence and were the most likely candidates for the throne. Even the third prince, who was relatively inferior, had a higher chance of taking the throne than the fourth prince. Power had a pride of its own, and power was precisely what Kaiser lacked.\u201cI apologize for the sudden visit, Duke Agnus. I was appointed by the Emperor and was only fulfilling his will. So please, kindly understand my immature behavior\u2014\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind, Prince.\u201dIt\u2019s odd that there\u2019s almost no talk of the Fourth Prince throughout all of vast Arcadia. This cub is keeping his claws hidden\u2026Duke Agnus kept his thoughts to himself, just as Joshua did. Joshua had been staring at Kaiser with a bitter smile on his lips, like an old man looking back on his poor life choices.This is the guy. A hypocrite who pretends to have no self-respect on the outside, acts like a gentleman, and dresses himself up with all kinds of rhetoric, but is exactly the opposite on the inside.How many people bled for that false grace?How many people died for that smile?Joshua was one of them.In the end, I was betrayed by my trusted master, and my life vanished in the nameless wilderness\u2026 It will be different this time, Kaiser.Did he feel Joshua\u2019s gaze? Kaiser turned his attention to Joshua. Startled when they suddenly met eyes, Kaiser forced a smile while a cold sweat trickled down his spin.\u201cHah! You must be the famed Young Master Joshua.\u201dJoshua didn\u2019t answer, prompting Valmont to step forward. Though he was known for slacking, he knew what he had to do now. He was here to protect not only the lives of the Imperial family, but its prestige. Above all, this mission came directly from His Majesty the Emperor.\u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Young Master Joshua. Compose yourself before the Prince.\u201d The entire 9th Battalion scowled at Joshua.If it were Duke Agnus himself, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. But how dare a bastard\u2014\u00a0Valmont\u2019s expression curdled. His sword was drawn in an instant, and the rest of the Imperial knights rested their hands on their own weapons.The Duke\u2019s Knights tensed. To them, Duke Agnus was greater than any Emperor. When their master was threatened they would fight, Imperial Knights or otherwise.\u201cCheeky\u2014!\u201d Valmont clenched his sword.\u201c\u2014That\u2019s funny.\u201d Joshua laughed, bursting the tension like a soap bubble.\u201cWha-what?\u201d Valmont\u2019s eyes popped.\u201cThere cannot be two suns over the Empire. Excepting their liege lords, the law of the Avalon Empire states there is only one person a Knight can salute. In such a situation, is there any reason I would salute to a self-proclaimed \u2018fourth prince\u2019?\u201dIsn\u2019t he just a kid?\u00a0Valmont\u2019s jaw dropped. For the first time, Valmont discovered someone who was an even worse shitter than himself.No other knights in the Avalon Empire could present such power as the Knights Templar did. Who else would they be escorting except the Imperial family?Are you claiming they have to present His Majesty\u2019s decree to receive courtesy?\u201cWhat a cheeky kid!\u201d\u201cHow rude!\u201d\u201cHow dare you? He was cleaning horse dung not long ago, wasn\u2019t he? He must\u2019ve fallen into a dung heap and gone crazy!\u201d The Prince\u2019s retinue was in an uproar.\u201cThere cannot be two suns over the Empire.\u201d\u00a0\u2014at first glance, it seemed obvious. The Emperor, Marcus von Britten, was the center of their universe. It seemed like an expression of infinite respect, but under the circumstances it was obvious that he meant he refused to respect the rest of the Empire.\u201cDamn!\u201d Joker, his cross-shaped scar pale against his reddened cheeks, drew his sword in anger. All of the knights followed suit, ready to kill for their respective masters.\u201c Stop! \u201d A voice loaded with mana blanketed their surroundings. The knights groaned under the impact.Duke Agnus strode forward with a grim scowl.\u201cShowing this damn attitude in front of the prince\u2014Do you want to die?\u201d His voice chilled them to the bones. He swept his gaze across the crowd, implying his sermon was not targeted just at a certain somebody. Even the Imperial Knights couldn\u2019t challenge the weight of authority in his voice.This is the power of the Nine Stars, Duke Agnus\u2026\u201d Admiration painted Valmont\u2019s face.\u201cKnights! Sheathe your swords!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The Duke\u2019s knights obeyed without question.\u201cWe\u2019re in front of the Prince!\u201d Valmont came to his senses and shouted urgently, \u201cPlease, sheathe your swords!\u201d\u201c...Yes!\u201dDuke Agnus then turned his overbearing charisma to Joshua, standing next to him.\u201cYour hasty words and actions caused this. Apologize to the Prince.\u201dJoshua smirked bitterly. He\u2019d lived a whopping half century, and yet\u2026\u00a0I thought my mind and body had grown enough, but my mind is like a child\u2019s.\u00a0When you despise someone so much you\u2019re swept away by the moment\u2026 Joshua steeled himself, but Prince Kaiser spoke just before he could step forward.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. It\u2019s already done\u2026 and he\u2019s not entirely wrong.\u201d\u201cPrince\u2014?\u201d Evergrant whirled around, bewildered.\u201cYoung Master Joshua is right. The only person who deserves the salutes of the Knights is my father, His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d Prince Kaiser wore a polite and benevolent smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine, so don\u2019t worry about me my dear knights.\u201d\u201cPrince\u2026\u201d Some of the knights teared up. They thought he was putting his pride aside to resolve a meaningless conflict.But I would be lying if I said that I, a scion of the noblest blood in the Empire, wasn\u2019t offended.\u201cAlso, knights need to prove themselves with their skills\u2026\u201d Prince Kaiser beamed at Joshua. \u201cI believe you\u2019re well aware, Young Master Joshua?\u201dJoshua couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. Kaiser truly was a clever spokesman; he\u2019d quickly taken control of the atmosphere and affirmed the trust of his subordinates in one move, and now he smoothly segued into testing Joshua.A master manipulator. Then, let me match your pace\u2026\u00a0Joshua left the Duke\u2019s side with a sharp smile.\u201cAnytime you\u2019re ready.\u201d\u201cA cheeky bastard until the end, I see\u2026\u201d Joker came forward with a sly grin. \u201cPrince, Battalion Commander, I ask your permission to perform this mana test.\u201d\u201cJoker?\u201d Valmont shot a worried glance at the Duke. Joker was careful to keep his fangs hidden.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just want to see if the Young Master has the skills to back his words.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cLet him do it.\u201d\u201cPrince?\u201d Troubled, Valmont turned to the Prince.\u201cSir Joker has already surpassed an expert\u2014a B-Class intermediate\u2014right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cTaking the Young Master\u2019s safety into account as well, I think Sir Joker\u2019s experience would be helpful.\u201dJoker beamed contentedly as Valmont was forced to zip his mouth shut.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous\u2026 Young Master, if you can handle my first attack, you will pass the exam. Of course, the attack isn\u2019t the same for everyone\u2014\u201d\u201cYou talk a lot.\u201d The space was immediately filled with a suffocating silence.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Everyone was gathered in the biggest training arena in the Duchy. The retinues of Arden von Agnus and the fourth prince Kaiser von Britten and Archmage Evergrant were present; being the grandest such facility in the estate, it could accommodate the entire crowd with room to spare, even with knights and their weapons on each corner.Valmont gulped when he spotted the Duke\u2019s commanders in the crowd. It was his first time seeing these prominent figures in the flesh.Two men stood alone in the middle of the arena, judging each other and being judged by the spectators.Or rather, one man and a boy\u2014a young cub without a hair to tickle his chest.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d The boy\u2019s opponent was Joker, the second-in-command of the Imperial 9th Battalion. Seeing him nod, Joker continued. \u201cThe test will be simple\u2026 We will fight three rounds before the judges. If any of them nod in approval during those three rounds, you pass.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. I\u2019ll only use mana on the lowest levels of C-Class.\u201dJoshua\u2019s unresponsiveness made Joker chuckle.I guess anyone would be nervous in this kind of situation.\u00a0Of course, Joker had no intention of accommodating him.\u00a0There was a reason why I didn\u2019t like this scumbag of a child. I can\u2019t even think straight in front of him.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Should an accident happen, wouldn\u2019t the Duke, the pride of the Empire, come running right away?\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201dJoker spoke with a modicum of courtesy because the people of the Duchy were watching, but to Joshua his patronizing attitude was palpable. The Imperial Knights were aware as well and were laughing their heads off.\u201cBut I told you\u2014\u201d Joshua smirked coldly. He wasn\u2019t about to let Joker walk away.\u201c\u2014You talk too much. You\u2019re a proud knight of the Empire, right? Don\u2019t you need to watch your wagging tongue?\u201d\u201cYou crazy\u2014!\u201d Joker was furious but he had to shut his mouth; the other Imperial Knights were equally silent. His expression was stiff but his anger was obvious nonetheless. Joshua had just insulted the entire Imperial Knights.\u201c...You\u2019ll regret saying that.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019d regret it, I wouldn\u2019t spend my time laughing at your pathetic face right now.\u201d Joshua guffawed.\u201c\u2014What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not soft enough to feel something as frail as \u2018regret\u2019 even in the most unusual circumstances.\u201d\u201cI guess you fight with your tongue, not your arms.\u201d Joker\u2019s eyes were as sharp as the blade hissing from his sheathe.I was planning to give you a mild beat down because there\u2019s so many eyes\u2026 But I\u2019m going to make sure you never hold a sword again.Joker was about to take a step forward, but abruptly halted.\u201c\u2014Is that a weapon?\u201d When he first saw the iron rod lying on the ground, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. He ignored it and focused on his opponent. But when he saw Joshua pick up the rod, he frowned.\u201c...What are you up to?\u201d\u201cThe test is too abstract. I want to change the rules a little bit.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Joker rolled his eyes.\u201cSimple\u2026 if you take a step back after receiving a hit, you lose. How about that?\u201dThe arena was overtaken by silence.Is he insane?\u00a0Is he trying to take on a B-Class intermediate knight? Even Duke Agnus\u2019s implacable facade cracked.\u201cYou\u2019re a cheeky bastard with too much ambition\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re talented or just prideful.\u201dBut, when Joker stopped to think about it, isn\u2019t this the best situation to get the job done? It was way better than doing something that would cost him his pride.\u201cAre you okay with that, battalion commander?\u201d Joker\u2019s lips curled into a fishy smile.\u201cAh, that\u2014\u201d Valmont was rattled by the sudden turn of events.He glanced at Duke Agnus. Valmont was responsible for the test, but he couldn\u2019t help but look to the Duke for approval.\u201cIf you wish.\u201d The Duke seemed to settle his thoughts and nodded sharply.Valmont smiled awkwardly and raised his hand, joining his thumb and forefinger to flash an OK sign.\u201cI\u2019ll do it if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Joker grinned savagely at Joshua and adopted a stance that balanced defense and offense. \u201cAttack me first.\u201dWhat nice weather! I was thinking\u2026 I\u2019ll show that cheeky kid hell on earth. As an added bonus, I\u2019ll cripple him so he won\u2019t be cocky again.Outwardly, though, Joker\u2019s words retained a veneer of sympathy:\u201cIt won\u2019t happen, but the test will end if I take even one step back\u2014in other words, you\u2019ll officially be a C-Class Knight of the Avalon Empire from that point on.\u201dJoshua hefted the iron rod. The motion was incredibly natural, as if the iron rod were an extension of his body.Joshua and Duke Agnus shared a look.\u201cIf you want to gamble, you go big or go home.\u201dJoker made a puzzled expression.\u201cI think a slight punishment is in order if you\u2019re the loser\u2026 the number of steps you take back will be the number of times you crawl on the floor and bark like a dog.\u201d\u201cI want to teach you a lesson\u2026 The way you posture like royalty troubles me.\u201d\u201cLike a dog at its master\u2019s heels\u2026\u201d\u00a0Joshua mouthed these last words, but Joker had no trouble understanding him.\u201cLet\u2019s just begin!\u201d His face flushed red.\u201cGreat.\u201d Joshua gripped the rod firmly and straightened his posture. The playfulness in his face was suddenly gone, replaced with a trance-like focus.What is this feeling\u2026?\u00a0Joker was startled by the sudden incongruity.\u00a0He\u2019s just a child with an appetite\u2026 Even if he\u2019s a genius beyond even the Grand Duke, I know he\u2019s only a C-Class at best\u2026 But what- what is this ominous feeling?\u201dIsn\u2019t this what a knight felt when he looked Death in the eyes on the battlefield? Joker could feel the specters of death hovering in the air.In contrast to Joker, Joshua was a little troubled.At this level, it\u2019s still difficult to use with a young body.\u00a0Cold sweat beaded on Joshua\u2019s forehead. He could tell he was overworking himself right now.\u00a0To use this technique properly, I have to be at least level 3. In an adult\u2019s body it\u2019d be easy but\u2014Joshua hadn\u2019t been standing still this last day. He\u2019d managed to master the technique Lugia had told him about; Joshua had passed the first stage of the Magic Spear Technique and reached the second stage.It\u2019s still unstable inside.\u00a0Like parasites, the two energies in his body were still locked in combat. He had enough control to exert a modicum of control over them, driving them into every corner of his body. The magic and divine power were usually quiet, but they had a tendency to react violently and unpredictably to Joshua\u2019s mana; like a maddened beast, it would lunge at Joshua\u2019s mana.It takes a lot of time to use, but its destructive power\u2026\u00a0Joshua had tensed as if he was going to rush forward right away, but didn\u2019t move after a long minute.\u201cThis is the wrong time to be scared, kid.\u201d Joshua didn\u2019t even react to Joker\u2019s sarcasm.I slowly raised the mana in my body over time.Did his efforts finally pay off? The three energies, entangled and absorbed, spilled forth from Joshua\u2019 fingertips and embraced the iron rod.Except that one time, this is the second time I\u2019m using this.\u00a0Joshua squeezed his eyes shut.Hey, what is this\u2026?\u00a0Was it just an illusion, or did Joker feel an explosion of huge energies?Joshua shot Joker an embarassed look, and lowed the iron rod at Joker.\u201cLugia.\u201d The rod responded eagerly to Joshua\u2019s voice. The shape changed little by little as if it knew exactly what it had to do\u2014from an ordinary iron cylinder to a peculiar spear with a forked tip.\u201cAn artifact?\u201d Duke Agnus was astonished.A weapon that changes shape? As far as he knew, only artifacts had special powers. What\u2019s more, a weapon with such unusual shape was probably ancient.\u201cPerhaps the test will end with this round,\u201d Joshua intoned.The sparks running hotly across the spear finally gathered at the tip.Joshua\u2019s mana, which lost its dazzling luster, was an enigma. The color of mana is determined by a person\u2019s innate character, but Joshua\u2019s mana was dark blue, a black-than-black hue, and a pure white. None of the colors mixed, like oil in water.\u201cCrazy!\u201d Joker rushed to rouse his mana.\u201cNow.\u201dLugia shot forth with thundering force, leaving behind a blinding trail of white.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Alarms were ringing in his head.This boy\u2026 is fucking dangerous. Joker clenched his teeth tightly. His instinct told him he needed to rouse his own mana to protect himself from the splendid point of mana Joshua had gathered.I'll match you\u2026 No, I'll overpower you.\u00a0The power Joker gathered wasn't hazy or cloudy; his mana was a deeper and darker blue than the depths of the sea: the exclusive traits of a B-Class Knight.No one even noticed.\u00a0Everyone's eyes were glued on the young boy across from him\u2014no doubt they could feel the oppressive atmosphere as well as he could.A spar between a C-Class and B-Class Knight rarely lasts this long. Under normal circumstances, the repulsive force alone would cause injuries\u2026 and my mission would be complete just like that. But what is this?Joker's eyes narrowed. No matter hyped his skills were, the boy was only a C-Class Knight\u2014and the gap between classes was an impenetrable wall. Yet, nobody took note of the difference in their value.Sparks flew; weapons collided. Even as the shower of sparks faded, Joshua was slamming his foot against the ground.\"\u2014WHAT?!\" The stamina it took to perform those kicks and runs was astounding.What happened next shattered all expectations.Joshua stretched forth, lashing out to stab at Joker. His spear was too fast to track, leaving a white streak across the audience's vision.That's too fast! I was going to counterattack, but\u2026 at this speed?\u00a0Its speed was blinding\u2014faster than light. All he could do was jam his sword in its path.Lugia met Joker's sword, and the sky trembled. A swarm of white lights burst from the tip of Joshua's spear and scattered over the entire arena.\"Ugh!\" Valmont was forced to shut his eyes.It was so dazzling I couldn't keep watching. Is this a nine-year-old boy? This is a test, but his skill\u2026 is fit for the battlefield!\u00a0A bewildering flood of thoughts washed through Valmont's head. He had never before seen someone more talented than him. Babel von Agnus, the rising star of the Empire? As talented as he was, he was famous for training in every waking moment; Valmont had achieved C-Class at the same age, but he took his time along the way to enjoy everything life could offer. Joshua was a level above them by talent alone.When Valmont opened his eyes to brave the fading light, the first thing that caught his eyes was Joshua von Agnus. Red blood dripped from his lips.No matter how powerful Joshua seemed, it was a clash between a B-Class and C-Class. The outcome was expected. No unexpected variables will emerge now.\"...Ten steps.\" Joshua wiped the blood from his lips. \"You took ten steps back.\"Valmont was shocked. He finally looked to the other side of the arena: unlike Joshua, who stood in the middle of the arena just as he'd started, his opponent was pushed into the far corner. Even more incredibly, he'd had to thrust his sword into the ground to stop himself from keeling over.\"What is this nonsense?\" Valmont's voice was thick with disbelief, and no one could object to his words.The arena was quiet enough to hear a pin drop. Most of the knights just gaped blankly at Joshua and Joker\u2014even Evergrant, who understood little of swordsmanship, seemed mesmerized.A small clap broke the silence.\"I really would have regretted not coming here.\" Prince Kaiser von Britten applauded Joshua with a wide smile. \"As a Prince of Avalon, I recognize your talent\u2026 You will truly be a gem of the Empire.\"This time, the Prince's words were sincere.\"Lord Valmont, isn't this enough for the test?\" Prince Kaiser turned towards the still-shocked knights.\"Yes? Ah\u2026\"\"Even with my cursory knowledge of swordsmanship, I think Young Master Joshua is amazing.\"\"Yes, of course.\"Valmont drew his sword\u2014it wasn't the sword he usually used, but a gorgeously decorated piece given to him by the Emperor for a specific purpose. The sound of it being unsheathed rang startlingly clear through the arena.\"I, Valmont dun Brown, speak by order of His Majesty the Emperor, the Sun of Avalon.\" As one, the Imperial Knights drew their blades. Their swords were raised in salute, and their faces were steely and expressionless.\"Joshua von Agnus, second son of the Duke of Agnus: approach.\"Joshua made a troubled expression. Although he didn't show it, he was having trouble just staying standing\u2014the side effects of using this power had stressed him beyond his limits.I have no intention of playing along with this charade, but\u2014\u00a0Joshua grit his teeth.\u00a0I never intended to show weakness.Everyone was watching, to say nothing of Prince Kaiser and Duke Agnus's greed for talent.My whole body burned for revenge when I looked at Kaiser. If I fail now, will I ever have a chance at defeating him?\"Are you okay?\" Duke Agnus came up to his side. His eyes were clouded with worry.What is this?\u00a0Joshua chuckled.\u00a0I've never seen him make this face before.\"I'm fine.\" Joshua gingerly made his way towards Valmont.The hall was eerily silent except for Joshua's footsteps. The Imperial 9th Battalion, the Knights of Agnus, the Fourth Prince, Evergrant, the Duke of Agnus\u2014everyone's eyes were locked on the small boy.Eventually, Joshua stood proudly before Valmont. Valmont's eyes trembled, but his voice was steady and solemn.This moment was the birth of the youngest mana user in the history of the Avalon Empire\u2014No, in the history of the entire continent.\"In accordance with His Majesty's will: from this moment forth, I declare Joshua von Agnus a C-Class Knight!\"The day after the test, the Imperial retinue had returned to the Imperial Palace. Of course, Prince Kaiser hadn't left without trying to seduce Joshua with his sweet promises. Joshua had deflected him with vague responses.\"Young Master Joshua\u2026 no, it's 'Sir' Joshua now\u2026 I won't say that I want you to be mine now. There will be plenty of time in the future. If you happen to be in Arcadia, please don't forget to visit me. It would be a great help for the Young Master.\"\"I have to ask\u2026 what kind of help are you talking about?\"\"Bypassing the normal exams, the royal family can recommend a knight to their service. Unlike the exam, you would not be obligated to ten years of service\u2026 In other words, the Young Master can have his fill of honey and leave whenever he wishes.\"\"Obviously, this isn't something I should be saying as a member of the royal family, but I want you to know that my greed for you is that great.\"Joshua couldn't help himself from laughing at the memory. When Prince Kaiser offered him that kind smile, however, he felt his stomach turn. If it weren't for Evergrant and Valmont, Joshua would have shoved Lugia through his foul mouth1. No two words described him better than \"hypocrisy\" and \"idiocy\".Contrary to public knowledge, the Imperial Knights have more than ten battalions.The 11th and 12th Battalions: the knights personally brought in by the royal family.The higher you go, the more skilled the knights were.There was a chance to challenge a battalion commander\u2026 and once you become a battalion commander, you have an opportunity to set foot inside the Palace once a year.The Palace housed an ancient artifact hidden from the public. It was one of Joshua's greatest regrets.First of all, I should deal with the situation right in front of me.He stood before an enormous and grandiose door. This was the entrance to the largest conference room in the Agnus estate; today, the entire family was gathered.\"In this life\u2026 You won't be treated like a puppet.\"I'll take it into my own hands.Joshua's expression hardened as he gripped the doorknob.The door creaked open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was where the Duke discussed matters big and small and where he held his most important meetings.The Duchy of Agnus, one of the most powerful military forces in the Empire, divided its vassalage into the knights, and the various nobles below Earl who took charge of administration, recruitment, and external affairs.Today the Duke held a regular session with his vassals. A long line of the Duke\u2019s most key subjects stood on either side of the luxurious red carpet, waiting for him to speak. The man himself was perched on a seat as ornate as the Imperial throne, lost in contemplation. He just stared wordlessly at the door with hazy eyes.\u201cNext, please. Important issues only, since we all know the day approaches when the Duke will return to the capital. Please take this chance to inform us of the biggest issues on the agenda.\u201d Count Anghel, supposedly the brains behind Duke Agnus, was managing the proceedings. A middle-aged, impressively muscled man quietly raised a hand.\u201cSir Armstrong, speak.\u201d\u201cOur dispatched members have returned suddenly.\u201dSeveral of the gathered vassals caught their breath. The Golden Mane Corps, Armstrong\u2019s command, were undoubtedly the strongest knights in Agnus; their performance was without question.Except for the bare minimum required to defend the family, the knights of Agnus were deployed outside the territory. Duke Agnus intended for his knights to gain practical experience from the world at large. Of course, this was only a minor part of their mission: the main goal of their dispatches were to understand the dynamics of the Empire, purge impure elements, assassinate or abduct traitors, and so forth; Despite their outward pride, they were heavily involved in wetwork.The return of not one, but two deployments was bound to be trouble.\u201cFirstly\u2026 it was reported that the situation in the Black Monster Forest, to the north, has changed dramatically.\u201dThe Black Monster Forest, bordering Agnus to the north, was true paradise for monsters. When the blood moon rose, ferocious monsters would come down to prey on their people. It was one of the Duchy\u2019s long-standing troubles.\u201cUp until now, the garrisons could handle it on their own\u2014but, for some reason, the number of monsters descending has doubled.\u201d\u201cOh my God\u2026 There must be thousands of them then\u2026\u201dArmstrong nodded in affirmation.\u201cThe bigger problem is that the Black Ogre has appeared with them.\u201d\u201cBlack Ogre\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy is that monster showing himself\u2026?\u201d The conference room rippled with agitation.The Black Ogre, a ferocious and solitary beast, was the apex predator even amongst the vicious monsters inhabiting the Black Forest. Its jaws could tear through trolls, and its thick hide could weather any magic below Class 3. In other words, only a 4th-Class wizard or a B-Class knight could challenge it.\u201cI will take care of it,\u201d said Duke Agnus. The noisy conference room quieted in an instant. Here, the word of Duke Agnus was law\u2014if he said he would take care of it, the vassals didn\u2019t question him. It was one of the oldest rules of Duke Agnus.Count Anghel broke the silence with a small cough.\u201c\u2014Please tell us about the next one, Sir Armstrong.\u201d\u201c...Okay. The second case concerns the Fifth Duke.\u201d\u201cThe Fifth Duke?\u201d This time, Duke Agnus was interested enough to straighten up.\u201cYes, the Pontier family.\u201d\u201cThe Pontier family\u2026\u201d The Pontier family was the wealthiest in Avalon. Above all else\u2026Did Charles and Cox have another reason to come here?\u00a0Duke Agnus mulled over it for a while.\u201cLet\u2019s hear that report separately.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Armstrong stepped back.\u201cIf you have anything to add to the agenda, please speak up.\u201d Count Anghel nodded firmly. Some of the vassals raised their hands and spoke their concerns.The family\u2019s financial condition, the movements of large sums of money\u2026 Various topics were brought up, such as a report on a promising new knight, but Duke Agnus remained aloof.\u201cFinally, we have the most important item on today's agenda.\u201d A hush fell over the conference room.\u201cAs you are all aware, something significant occurred just yesterday. Master Joshua, only nine years old this year, has been elevated to a C-Class Knight in recognition of his abilities. He is the rising star of the Duchy. In terms of talent alone, he is said to surpass even Master Babel, who thought to be the finest talent in the Empire.\u201d\u201cCount Anghel, isn\u2019t that too subjective?\u201d One of the vassals openly frowned.\u201cYes, Count Tluman\u2026 Which part of my sentence would you call \u2018subjective\u2019?\u201dCount Tluman glanced around before rising from his seat. He had a thick, bushy beard and a cheerful demeanor that made him look more like a marauding bandit than an aristocrat. Contrary to his crude appearance, however, he sat in one of the most powerful positions in the family, the financier.\u201cI admit that Young Master Joshua\u2019s talent indeed deserves recognition. However, we can\u2019t say for certain if his talent can surpass even Young Master Babel. Master Babel has rigorously practiced since his childhood, while Young Master Joshua has only just awakened to his mana. Even if they\u2019re both C-Class, there will no doubt be a significant disparity.\u201d Count Tluman carried on, unaware that Joshua and Babel had already tested their prowess against each other. \u201cIf that\u2019s all, I would be done. But\u2026 don\u2019t you know? Young Master Joshua certainly has some unclear circumstances.\u201dMost of the Ducal vassals shook their heads. Some of them agreed, some of them were shaking their heads in disapproval.Count Tluman glanced at Duke Agnus; seeing that his expression remained stoic, he opened his mouth again.\u201cAs you know, not so long ago, Master Joshua was an outsider and often called a bastard. Most people would not have recognized his face. He was far cry from the genteel upbringing Young Master Babel received.\u201d Some in the audience nodded eagerly. \u201cHe appeared one day and became a C-Class Knight at meteoric speed. Considering his age, this situation becomes even harder to explain! How did he reach that level, anyways? Even if the Duke guided him year-round, it would be a bumpy road. \u2018Talent\u2019 isn\u2019t sufficient to explain this.\u201d\u201cSo, what does Count Tluman want to say?\u201d Count Anghel pushed him to get to the point.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Count Tluman hesitated. \u201cI suspect Young Master Joshua bowered the power of a monster.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018monster\u2019?\u201d Count Anghel was taken aback, but most, including the knights, nodded as if they\u2019d anticipated it.\u201cEveryone must have seen it. That unheard-of weapon Young Master Joshua used.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cA weapon that changes form. As far as I know, the only things imbued with magical powers are artifacts. Even I haven\u2019t seen a weapon like that.\u201d All the money and treasures headed for the Duchy passed through Count Tluman\u2019s hands, including those destined for the Duke himself. Tluman had acquired an eye for weaponry.\u201cIt had an odd form. Although it superficially resembled a spear, I doubt such an enormous force could be contained in a spear. Or at least, this was the first I\u2019d ever seen it.\u201dSuch was the extent of their understanding of the spear.\u201cI agree with Count Tluman.\u201d Chiffon rose to his feet. \u201cI had the opportunity to see Young Master Joshua a little earlier than most of those gathered here. Back then, he looked so weak I thought he might have a congenital mana disorder.\u201dThe vassals were abuzz.\u201cThose who were present yesterday must have felt it. The eerie aura coming from Young Master Joshua when he struck Lord Joker was mixed with various auras, but in a sense it definitely had similarities with magic.\u201d\u201cMagic\u2014!\u201d The audience erupted.\u201c...In other words,\u201d Count Anghel inquired with a grim expression. \u201cSir Chiffon also believes that Young Master Joshua achieved that state by borrowing the power of a monster?\u201dChiffon nodded without hesitation.\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then Young Master Joshua\u2014\u201d\u201cBlack magic and demon magic are taboo across\u2014\u201d\u201cIt would causes great damage to the family. It feels like I\u2019ve been turning a blind eyes to such\u2014\u201dDespite his vassals\u2019 agitation, Duke Agnus remained silent.Then, the tightly shut doors swung open, allowing a small boy into the conference room.Instantly, the hall was silent enough to hear the fall of his little feet. Duke Agnus and his vassals cast peculiar looks at Joshua.\u201cMonster\u2026\u201d Joshua murmured, and cast Chiffon a frigid smile. \u201cYou can test it yourself.\u201dThe assemblage was astounded by the words coming from his tiny mouth. Only Duke Agnus, eyeing him from down the length of the table, sported a wide smile.How long will you entertain me?Duke Agnus chuckled, too quiet for anyone else to notice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joshua smirked back at him.\"It is what it is. Shouldn't you try it for yourself? See if I really did borrow a monster's power or not? You can tell if we fight, can't you?\"If I make a mistake\u2026 I'll be punished by the Master immediately.\u00a0Chiffon's jaw clenched. Agreeing was not an option, right in front of the Duke. The vassals who'd raised their voices earlier now wore casual expressions and kept their lips sealed like it had nothing to do with them.They're like vultures.\u00a0Chiffon cussed under his breath.In a swordfight\u2026 the boy's skills are\u2026\u00a0Chiffon was loath to admit it, but Joshua didn't need a monstrous weapon to be a monster. He'd seen Joshua fight Babel. The boy in question was looking him straight in the eyes with a devilish smile dancing on his lips.\"What, aren't you confident? Hahh\u2026 Shouldn't one of the Duke's commanders be among the bravest?\"Chiffon wouldn't normally react to such a blatant, childish provocation, but something about the situation made his blood boil.This brat!\u00a0There was death in Chiffon's eyes, but Joshua grinned daringly at him.\"Stop.\" The conference room rattled under Duke Agnus's mana-infused voice.\"Chiffon, you should stop. Joshua, you need to stop also.\"Chiffon stepped back, and Joshua shut his mouth.\"There is one thing you all, including Chiffon, are overlooking. You hadn't forgotten who was there when Joshua's mana was assessed, have you?\"The doubt in his vassals' eyes faded, replaced by understanding.\"I don't believe our family's knights were somehow inferior to them, but\u2026 they are the best knights in the Empire.\"\"The Imperial Knights\u2026\" Armstrong was comparing them to the Golden Mane Corps. In terms of sheer power, the Golden Mane was the equal of one of the Imperial Knights' top five battalions\u2014in other words, they were more than a match for the Imperial 9th Battalion.But no one can predict that until they actually face each other in combat. The fact that the Imperial Knights Templar are the strongest in the Empire is unquestionable.Yesterday's fight was spectated not only by the Imperial Knights but by the Imperial Chief Wizard Evergrant and the Master, one of the 9 stars of the Empire. One of the Imperial Knights personally crossed blades with Joshua.If he really did use a monster's power, someone would have noticed. After all, these are the most extraordinary men in the Empire.\u00a0Not to mention, Joshua had the Duke's utmost attention.\"I believe that should resolve the controversy. Any objections?\" No one responded\u2014their mouths were shut like the issue had never come up in the first place.\"I have no doubts. In my opinion, that weapon didn't look like a monster's artifact at all. But\u2026\" Duke Agnus turned his gaze onto Joshua. \"...That doesn't mean all the questions have been answered.\"Duke Agnus's grim, humorless smile seemed to pin Joshua in place.\"I have many things I'm curious about. I wanted to inquire about your sudden growth, and I'm sure my vassals are curious as well.\"Yes!\u00a0Chiffon cheered, exhilarated.\u00a0What was I so worried about? If the Master wishes it, I'll gladly dig up this boy's dirt.Chiffon gazed imploringly at Duke Agnus but wasn't spared a glance.\"Joshua\u2026 I will take you to the capital.\"\"Duke?\" Chiffon was bewildered, and the rest of the vassals were no different.You're taking him to the capital?\u00a0That could only mean one thing.\"Questions aside, Joshua's talent is undeniable. According to the customs of the Duchy, we should give the child a chance.\"Such was the iron rule of the Duke: all talented people are given equal opportunities regardless of rank. Anyone with a passion for swords would not be in need.This damn\u2014!\u00a0Chiffon bit his lip angrily. The moment that brat gets away from here, it would disrupt all his planning. If he was talented now, then when he returned in a few years\u2026Young Master Babel would lose the race for succession! I don't even want to think about it\u2026\u00a0It wasn't far-fetched at all, seeing how fast he'd grown till now.That monstrous talent can render all my power meaningless\u2026 but there's no point in fretting. The Master's words are final. What more can I say?\"Are you dissatisfied?\" The Duke regarded Joshua with a slight smile dancing on his lips.Obviously, going to the capital is a massive advantage at this point. But\u2026Joshua shook off his doubts.\"I have one request.\"\"What?\"\"I want to go to the capital with my mother.\"\"That's impossible!\" Chiffon shouted. \"If the Duke went to the capital with Madame Lucia, what would become of Duchess Vanessa?\"\"What if people don't look?\" Joshua's voice was frigid. \"Are you saying the Duke should only care about these selfish reasons?\"This bastard!\u00a0Chiffon clenched his teeth, feeling the atmosphere turn against him. Again, he couldn't say \"Yes\" here\u2014he would sound like a mother-in-law. The feeling of being led around by this kid was driving him crazy.\"I-I am only worried that the Duke's reputation will suffer if he only favors Madame Lucia.\" Chiffon tried and failed to hide his embarrassment.\"Shut it.\" Duke Agnus raised his hand.\"Yes, Duke.\"\"I'll allow it.\"\"Thank you, Duke.\" Joshua bowed.Duke Agnus smiled\u2014Joshua's bow was unusually sincere.He's still no ordinary child.\u00a0The Duke chuckled to himself.\u00a0I don't know how long it's been since I've felt this way. I never experienced it with Babel or that Red Cross \"kid\".\u00a01\"Does anyone have an opinion on this matter?\" Duke Agnus looked around.\"Everything according to the will of the Master.\" Count Anghel was the first to bow.\"Everything according to the will of the Master!\" Even Chiffon followed.\"Then it's decided.\" With that, Duke Agnus rose from his seat. \"As soon as we clear the Black Forest, we leave for Arcadia. All things related to your reports must be completed by then.\"\"Understood!\"\"And Armstrong? Bring Pontier's report to my room as soon as it's in order. Even better, bring the knights from the dispatch with you, if possible.\"\"I heed your order.\" Armstrong bowed.\"Joshua, I want to see you in my room as soon as the meeting is over.\"\"Yes.\"\"Today's meeting is adjourned.\" Duke Agnus walked forward with a satisfied smile.\"Wait a minute!\" A loud voice slipped through the open door.The person who emerged from behind the door left the vassals dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is an emergency! I have to tell you something!\u201d\u201cCalm down first, Cox, and then speak.\u201d\u201cA new C-Class Knight was promoted here yesterday! Yes! Right here!\u201d\u201cCox, please.\u201d Rather than excited, Charles just frowned. \u201cYou must have forgotten that this is the Agnus Estate\u2014they\u2019re famous for producing great knights. Such a fuss over a C-Class promotion.\u00a0Hah. I expected more from you.\u201d\u201cWhat if that C-Class Knight was only nine years old\u2014even younger than the princess?\u201d\u201cWhat?! \u2026No way.\u201d\u201cYes! Fortunately, Young Master Joshua has finally been recognized by the Imperial Family! Now he\u2019s a legitimate mana user!\u201d\u201cYes, he is.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d Cox was puzzled by Charles\u2019s lukewarm reaction. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cooped up in your room for quite some time now, so I thought the news wouldn\u2019t fly so fast to you\u2014but I guess you already knew?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Charles shook her head. \u201cIn fact, this is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\u201cThen why are you reacting like that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the weird one, Cox. This isn\u2019t anything new; we already knew his talent.\u201d\u201cYes, but this is different from such an informal evaluation. Official Imperial recognition means that he will be known across the Avalon Empire as the youngest mana user in history!\u201dCox\u2019s face scrunched up in frustration. His life revolved around money; he rarely thought of the knights as anything more than numbers in his checkbook. As far as he was concerned, money was the truest transcendental power\u2014but such boundless talent was a whole different story.What happens when the world knows of Joshua\u2019s incredible talent?\u00a0The world could not leave Joshua alone. Cox knew that better than anyone.\u201cHonestly, when the Princess first took an interest in Young Master Joshua, my head felt heavy. Back then, he was just the bastard son of a concubine with a smattering of talent\u2014or so it seemed. But now, it\u2019s clearly different. Never before in the history of the continent has someone become a mana user before the age of ten.\u201dCharles stared silently at him, making Cox feel somewhat self-conscious.\u201cThe Pontier family have money and fame aplenty. However, even the most talented person can only do so much with it\u2026 Sometimes, money isn\u2019t the solution.\u201d\u201c...What is it?\u201d Curiosity crept into Charles\u2019s expression.\u201cDo you know why your father sent both of us here?\u201d\u201c...He must\u2019ve sent me here to do something with Babel\u2019s brother somehow,\u201d Charles muttered bitterly.\u201cHalf right, half wrong.\u201d Cox shook his head.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe important issue is why he wanted the Princess and Young Master Babel together: the Mercenary King. Nobody thought he would be with the Marquis of Crombell.\u201dCharles frowned.The Mercenary King Barbarian: a Sword Master of common birth, with the skill of an A-Class Knight. No\u2014he would be more accurately described as an Ax Master. He wielded an ax the size of a grown man in one hand and with it battled his way across the continent, gathering mercenaries as he went. Thus, he was known as the \u201cMercenary King\u201d.He was widely considered to be just below the Nine Stars\u2014really, he could be one of them if he wanted to.Unfortunately for the Pontier family, there were rumors that the Mercenary King had secret ties with the Marquis.Marquis Crombell was the second most wealthy noble in the Avalon Empire, after Duke Pontier. The head of the family lived in the same area as the Pontiers, so they inevitably bumped shoulders from time to time. In recent times, their clashes had intensified; now, it has reached the point where war could break out at any time.\u201cIf the rumors are not true, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014but if it\u2019s the other way around, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d Charles said with a serious expression. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m in a situation where I can tell the people around me about my situation.\u201d\u201cYou understand very well, Princess.\u201d Cox smiled softly and nodded.Both families were closely tied to the merchants and were thus very sensitive to rumors. What if whispers arose of a war between their two families? Their customers would react poorly, and their competitors would come snapping at their heels. The Imperial Palace forbids warfare without justifications, but the investigation they would send was a problem in its own way.Therefore, the struggle between the two families stayed within the shadows.\u201cIf a territorial battle takes place, the whole world would be watching. The best solution would be to finish the job in the shortest time possible\u2026 In the end, the key is how quickly you can repel your opponent.\u201d\u201c\u2018Money isn\u2019t the solution\u2019... You were referring to the Mercenary King?\u201d\u201cYou really are the daughter of the Pontier family.\u201d Cox nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s why they were trying to curry a relationship with Babel\u2019s brother\u2026 If it develops, the Crombell family won\u2019t be able to sit still.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201c...I like strong people too, but I can\u2019t help but feel bitter after learning the truth.\u201dWhat?\u00a0Was he mistaken, or had this free-spirited girl matured at some point?\u00a0Then\u2026 am I going to be the keystone of this operation?\u201cCan\u2019t we just ask uncle1\u00a0for help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026 Don\u2019t you know this isn\u2019t a normal situation? It\u2019s the Mercenary King. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s solely driven by money, so it\u2019s not an emergency. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary to bow down and beg for help first.\u201d When Charles\u2019s expression did not improve at all, Cox sighed. \u201c...That\u2019s what the elders of the family think\u2026 You may not understand it yet, Princess, but for a noble, there is nothing more important than his pride\u2014even more so in front of a higher-ranking noble.\u201d\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t agree?\u201d Charles looked up. \u201c...At least I don\u2019t do anything stupid that would put my pride in jeopardy during a family crisis.\u201d\u201cYou say that, but\u2026 I know you, Princess. You pretend to be interested, but you don\u2019t really like Young Master Babel at all. I have served the Princess for a long time; I hope your life will not be sacrificed in the name of your family.\u201d\u201cCox\u2026\u201d Charles looked moved.\u201cBut\u2026 as a vassal of the Pontier family, this crisis cannot be ignored. It is my wish that the Princess and Young Master Joshua have a serious conversation at least once, if both of you are willing. For a brief moment, you were somehow different when you dealt with Young Master Babel versus Young master Joshua. There was nothing strange about it\u2014I felt, shall I say, \u2018sincerity\u2019?\u201dCox scratched his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I was mistaken\u2026 It is indeed a great setback for the Pontiers for them to have a second child of such unprecedented talent. Don\u2019t worry too much about it\u2014I only said it because of greed.\u201d\u201cNo, Cox.\u201d Shaking her head, Charles\u2019s dull eyes sharpened. \u201cBefore we leave\u2026 arrange a meeting with the Young Master. When that child is available\u2026 I hope Cox would be kind enough to arrange a meal for the two of us.\u201dCox\u2019s expression brightened.\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d Cox bowed and moved away from the terrace.Is this really okay?\u00a0Charles, left alone on the terrace, let the worry show on her face. Cox didn\u2019t know, but Charles still couldn\u2019t forget the way that child had reacted.Charles\u2019s sigh wafted quietly across the terrace.Father and son sat across from each other in the Duke\u2019s room.\u201cDo you understand why I said that?\u201d Duke Agnus was the first to broach the silence.\u201cYou don\u2019t want the family to bleed; the battle for succession is not just a matter between the heirs. Many will be purged\u2014if it were within my abilities, I\u2019d make it so that no one would get hurt.\u201dDuke Agnus examined Joshua\u2019s face without saying a word.He has the right idea.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s precocious talents made the Duke like him more and more.\u201cConfidence and arrogance are separated by a thin line.\u201d The Duke chuckled. \u201cIn that sense, your confidence is not bad.\u201d\u201cNow, before you go to Arcadia, you will have to give up the name of \u2018Joshua von Agnus\u2019.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLet me give you a present.\u201d Duke Agnus held out something to Joshua.\u201cThis is\u2014?\u201dDuke Agnus\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The expedition was quite modest for a group led by a duke of the Empire\u2014it consisted of only a hundred people, including Armand, the only 4th-Class wizard in the Duchy, the Red Knights, and the two Young Masters.Naturally, the vassals\u2014particularly the commander of the Golden Mane Corps, Armstrong\u2014were fiercely opposed. Were something to happen to the Duke's personal health, the entire Duchy would be shaken to its roots.\"Who is protecting whom?\" Duke Agnus silenced the opposition just like that. After all, Duke Agnus only allowed the strong to participate in the expedition; in fact, the initial plan was for the Duke to take his two sons into the Black Forest with no one else, but his vassals' objections were too strong.There's no denying he's a great person, muttered Joshua as he watched Duke Agnus walking ahead of him. He was the worst father, but there was no better superior\u2014his personality was superb, to say nothing of his skills. The present aristocracy was locked up in their sense of privilege down to their bones; only a few people treated their subordinates like actual human beings.That's probably why so many people gathered under him.Joshua fiddled with a small ring the Duke of Agnus had given him the day before. It was a \"Deon Ring\", a family treasure. This ring, smaller than a finger knuckle, was created by the Magic Tower Master at immense cost. It was known as the \"Masterpiece of the Magicians\", but its function was simpler than one might think: infusing mana into the ring would instantly provide the wearer with armor; it also amplifies magic, and provides the ability to ignore magic below a certain level.All existing Deon Rings were divided into ranks similar to those of the knights. Even the lowest level C-Class Deon Ring could buy an entire castle. But Deon Rings could not be purchased with wealth alone\u2014as if to capitalize on their scarcity, their creator would sell them only to nobles with a reputation to match their money.Later, a Knight made the ring so popular that it became a necessity\u2026 but that was a long time ago. The important thing is\u2026\u00a0Joshua glanced awkwardly at the ring in his hand.A golden border around a flawless white body; a flash of purple brilliance in the center.\u2026this Deon Ring is an A-Class.\u00a0There were less than ten A-Class Deon Rings in the entirety of the Avalon Empire.Each family owned at least two rings: one, of course, was for the head of the household; the other was for the family's heir, the next chief of the household, although there were times when nobles and the Imperial family would give their spare Deon Rings to their most trusted knights.However, no family on the continent could boast of two A-Class Deon Rings\u2014the family's second ring would always be of a rank lower than the ring the head wore.And yet, a second A-Class Deon Ring lay in Joshua's palm.\"This\u2014?\"\"It's called a Deon Ring\u2026 It's not mine, of course. There was a time when I helped the Master, and he gave this to me; he said that I should give this to my child when he was born. I won't go into detail on how it functions\u2026 just put a little bit of your mana in here, and you'll understand everything.\"\"This\u2026 Deon Ring\u2014wasn't this artifact supposed to be passed to the successor?\"\"Don't get me wrong.\"\u00a0Duke Agnus had burst into laughter.\u00a0\"I'm not giving this to you. I'm just\u2026 lending it. It would just rot in the corner otherwise.\"Joshua had been dumbfounded. He couldn't believe the Duke would treat this precious artifact like a commonplace product.\"Well, that's not all. The armor the Deon Ring creates bears the insignia of the family it belongs to. Above all, I really hate when someone covets what's mine.\"Is he marking me as his own?\"If you go to Arcadia, you will need to give up the name 'Joshua von Agnus'. Your false identity is the heir of an anonymous author. It would be good to come up with a good name for yourself.\"Joshua sighed. Why did he have to hide his identity? It had to be the same reason the Duke was \"lending\" him the ring: it was the best way to prevent any complications.I don't think he's considering my training at all.\u00a0Joshua smirked. Indeed, the Duke was forged from iron, and his bloodline was no different. He had no time to spare to take care of Joshua.But, the Duke was right: he had to hide his identity.If someone of noble blood tries to hit me, I should use the Deon Ring.\u00a0\"Don't mess with the Agnus family,\" is what the Duke implied by giving him the ring. The Imperial family wouldn't dare recruit Joshua when they knew he already belonged to the Duke.\"Do you resent me?\"Joshua had lifted his head to regard the source of the quiet yet dominating voice. Then, for the first time, the Duke had laid his emotions bare for Joshua to see\u2014and then it was gone as quickly as it appeared.\"...Ah, you know what? Let's just go out.\"Joshua had saluted the Duke and quickly left the room.Am I resentful?\u00a0Joshua pondered, quietly repeating the Duke's words.Do I resent the Duke?I honestly don't know.Joshua's memories of him in his past life had faded into a blur. He certainly hadn't wanted to see the Grand Duke die in vain.If I had to say, maybe his crime of neglect?\u00a0He'd left Joshua and his mother alone, causing his mother's early death; however, he'd had so many enemies in his last life that the resentment faded away.Time is the best medicine, but that doesn't mean his neglect can be forgiven so easily.More importantly\u2026\u00a0Joshua could feel a hot gaze probing him from the side. It'd been like this the entire expedition. Babel, walking side by side with Joshua, eyed him from head to toe; Joshua was starting to wonder if there was something on his face.This is uncomfortable.\u00a0Joshua frowned.This is exactly why Joshua hadn't wanted to participate in this expedition in his first life. Now, however, Joshua desperately needed to buy time.A vessel sufficient to hold the power will be created naturally as my body grows, just by standing around and doing nothing.\u00a0But that was not enough for Joshua. He needed to push his young body to the limits and to understand this new power.He needed to contemplate himself\u2014all he needed was time on his own.If I hadn't recalled my distant memories, I would have avoided this expedition at any cost.\u00a0At this time, monsters would rampage simultaneously across the continent. From his past life, Joshua knew why.The stones of origin. One of them must have been in this place, the Black Monster Forest.Attribute stones differ from the mana stones wizards refine; in other words, it was a completely different material than what was used in magical objects. Unlike the mana stones, which only contain \"mana\", the origin stone has each \"attribute\". Only five such stones were found in his previous life\u2014such a powerful object would obviously attract Joshua's attention. The stone of origin would be of great help to him one way or another. It could even amplify his potential power once again and control the boundaries that only he knew.\"From here, we ride horses.\"Joshua was shaken from his thoughts by a voice.The expedition silently departed their home and found their way to where horses were prepared for them. The family servants who managed the horses had bowed their heads from the moment they spotted Duke Agnus approaching in the distance.\"How are the horses?\"\"I have prepared the best for you, Duke.\"Duke Agnus nodded and mounted his white horse.\"Each one of you, choose a suitable horse and mount immediately! From here on, we need to speed up our march!\"\"Yes!\" The knights sprung into motion in unison, leaving Joshua standing blankly by himself. Chiffon saw him and burst into laughter.\"Duke, it seems that Young Master Joshua does not know how to ride a horse. Perhaps he never learned.\"Duke Agnus frowned. It seemed as if the issue hadn't occurred to him.Chiffon had spoken with a large voice, allowing everyone to hear him. He smiled winningly when the other knights glanced towards them.\"Actually, he hadn't lived with the family until not too long ago\u2014\"\"You said you lived in a stable? You lived with horses all your life\u2014shouldn't you know how to ride?\"\"You shovel horse manure, right?\" But\u2026 surely you don't think it's that easy to ride a horse?\"\"Wouldn't it be better to send Young Master Joshua back?\"Some of the knights sounded concerned, but most were just ridiculing. For a knight, horseback riding was as natural as breathing\u2014was there anything more shameful for a proud knight?Only when all the knights were mounted, did Joshua begin to move. He padded quietly towards a horse, with Chiffon watching eagerly.\"I'm only bluffing, sorry.\" No, you should give it a try\u2026 Hah! Horses are not that easy, you bastard.\u00a0Chiffon grinned snidely.Joshua stroked the horse's nose, drawing a happy rumble from the animal. Joshua gave a satisfied smile and leaped off the ground, landing neatly on the saddle. His movements were light and acrobatic\u2014even the horse didn't react to the sudden weight.Chiffon and the Red Knights were astonished.\"What is this\u2014?\" Chiffon choked on his words.Duke Agnus loosed a hearty laugh.\"Depart!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wizards speculated that each attribute had origin stones, such as water, fire, wind, lightning, and ice. However, only five stones would ever be found\u2014even then, not until later.Origin stones were a true treasure to the wizards: they could raise the power of a one-circle spell, like Fire Arrow or Ice Arrow, to that of 3rd Grade magic, such as Fire Spear or Ice Spear.If so, wouldn't it be useless to the knights?Not exactly\u2014in Joshua's previous life, a knight achieved some truly formidable feats using the power of the origin stone.The Knight of Red Flame, Ulabis.One swing of his sword split the ground in two. A sea of fire erupts from the thrust of his sword and engulfs the world in relentless flames. An incarnation of battle, sweeping through his enemies like a wildfire.Seulan, the only principality on the continent, will eventually gain independence from Seuwalloulo and become a sovereign kingdom.The independence of the Seulan Principality would shatter the status quo between the continent's three powers.The person who moved mountains to make this happen was the \"Knight of the Red Flame\", Ulabis.Ulabis ascended as the first king of Seulan Kingdom, then surpassed the 12 superhumans and occupied the first seat of the Nine Stars.He was the ideal figure of the Absolute: intelligent, skillful, and utterly undefeatable. Even as a child, Ulabis's talent for swordsmanship was too great for a mere kingdom\u2014it was extraordinary even in an empire, befitting one of the strongest in the continent.He was called a \"magic swordsman\" and shook his head at the knights who claimed such a thing was impossible. Many wondered if he would be the first and only superhuman of his kind; but, when his secret was revealed, everyone concluded that the \"magic swordsman\" was a lie.It turned out, Ulabis was using the Red origin stone, the origin stone infused with the flame attribute.\"The attributes are not important,\" Joshua muttered.They were dubbed \"origin stones\" because they collect the primordial power of the beginning; these artifacts had accumulated power over an incomprehensible amount of time, far from human hands.I couldn't even begin to imagine the power that stone is hiding.\"Halt!\" A roaring from the front of the expedition roused him from his thoughts.Before him lied a small castle, designed with obvious practicality: the lord's castle in the Locke Territory, which bordered the Black Monster Forest.\"Salute the Duke!\" At the cry of a muscular, middle-aged knight, the Locke soldiers saluted, chins raised.\"Rise!\" Duke Agnus dismounted his horse and approached the knight.\"It's been a while, Roben.\"\"Yes, Duke.\"Duke Agnus smiled softly.\"I always feel sorry for everyone here\u2026 especially you. Even after retirement, you're still suffering in this barren land.\" Duke Agnus displayed a sincere expression of regret.Roben is one of the seven knights that served the Duke until just a few years earlier. The Duke particularly liked him for his dedication.\"I am honored to be able to assist the Duke with my humble efforts,\" Roben said with a friendly smile. \"Even though my body is old and my strength slowly leaves my body, my heart is always with the glorious Duke. Moreover, all I wanted for the rest of my life was to settle with my family. I am happy, Duke.\"The life he wanted\u2026\u00a0Duke Agnus's expression tightened. The Duke knew he could spend the rest of his life with his family too, but he knew that life would never be smooth sailing.Roben was suddenly pushed aside by an enormous middle-aged man.\"I greet the Duke!\"\"This\u2014\" Roben made an embarrassed face.\"Roben, are you losing your eyesight? If the Duke arrived, you should have called me first!\"\"That\u2014\" Roben was about to say something but shut his mouth. He hadn't had any time to catch his breath while preparing himself for the expedition into the Black Forest, but he couldn't offer such excuses in front of the Duke.\"... I'm sorry, my lord.\" Roben quietly lowered his head.\"This is why you have to step down when you get older! With that kind of thinking, I'll have to take responsibility for any security breaches in the estate in the future!\"\"Once again, I apologize.\" Roben's face flushed beet red. It was a common sort of discrimination, but it was difficult to defend himself especially in front of his most respected Duke.No one cared if the venerable knight felt humiliated or night.The middle-aged man stared at Roben as if waiting for the others to back him up. After a few seconds of silence, he ducked his head and turned away.\"Ahem\u2026 It's been a while since I last saw you, my Duke. I apologize for this rather unfortunate greeting\u2014I was too busy preparing for dinner. It pains me, but it's my fault for managing the staff poorly. Please punish me, my Duke.\"\"No need,\" said the Duke, straight-faced. \"...Although I must say, you seem to have gained weight since we last met, Vig.\"As the Duke had noted, his flesh swayed with each movement, and buckets of sweat poured down his body like broth\u2014a distinctly uncomfortable sight for the knights. The more perceptive vassals noticed the discomfort in Duke Agnus's words, yet the man named Vig burst out laughing. Like a pig, it seemed as if he didn't notice their judgment at all.\u201cHahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! I'm sorry\u2014but isn't this all thanks to the Duke's special attention?\" Vig rubbed his hands together as he spoke. \"I was deeply moved when I heard the Duke came to solve the problems of this humble estate within a month.\"Roben, the only man with equal authority to Vig, simply remained silent. This ponderous, bloated, piggy man was the lord of the Locke estate, Viscount Vig Beck Stek. Viscount Vig was related to Vanessa, the current lady of the Agnus family; when Vanessa was married to the Duke of Agnus, Viscount Vig came with her. To put it bluntly, he was a low-ranked noble riding on the Imperial bloodline.Duke Agnus opened his mouth to say something but instead sighed and turned to someone else.\"\u2014Anna, how are you?\"\"I greet the Duke.\" The girl in question had brown hair and light freckles, a common appearance she shared with her father. She couldn't be compared to Charles or Iceline, but her beauty stands out in its own way\u2014pure white skin, a pretty face, and fine features. Anna, the only daughter of Viscount Vig.Duke Agnus eyed the Viscount once again, startling him.\"Huh? Is that\u2026 Young Master Babel is also here!\" The Viscount approached Babel with an ever-so-welcoming expression.\"It has been a while, Uncle.\"\"You have grown taller, Young Master Babel! This makes me so happy and emotional. Hahahahaha.\"Babel smiled faintly.Some people might point at me and say I'm only doing this out of self-interest\u2014but to me, at least, he loved me like a relative.\"\"You've become so powerful that even me, who knows little of swords, can feel it!\" Viscount Vig quivered. \"I wonder if another master will be born in the Empire soon\u2026 Hahahahaha.\"Viscount Vig then tilted his head.\"And who might this be\u2026?\" Only then did he notice Joshua standing beside his father. The presence of this young child stood out in this dangerous place.\"This is Young Master Joshua, Viscount Vig.\" Chiffon stepped forward to answer.\"Ah! Long time no see, Sir Chiffon\u2014but\u2026 Young Master Joshua\u2026?\"\"The Duke's second son.\"Naturally, Viscount Vig's expression was incredulous. Rumors abounded of Joshua's unheard-of talent, but it had only been a short time since he had gained influence\u2014he'd changed so much, one might think he was someone else entirely. The remote Locke estate received information at a slow trickle.\"I see\u2014I must have had my eyes and ears shut for a long time, haha. When did sister Vanessa give birth to the Young Master, again?\"\"He's not a son of Lady Vanessa.\" Chiffon shook his head.Viscount Vig felt like a bucket of ice water was dumped on his head.\"Did the Duke take a concubine?\"The Duke showed no intention of answering his question, nor did anyone else. Even Viscount Vig could notice he'd broached a sensitive topic.\"Oh, I hope you can forgive me\u2026 I was just surprised by the sudden revelation. I never knew the Duke would take a concubine, but I don't mean it as a bad thing! It's only natural for a hero to take in a second or third wife.\"Viscount Vig shot glances at Chiffon, but the knight refused to meet his eyes.\"Well then, what lineage does the Young Master come from?\"\"Unfortunately, it's not a noble family.\"\"What do you mean?\"This time, Chiffon kept his mouth shut. \"Commoner, and a lowly maid,\" rose in his throat, but he would rather not offend his Master. Vig ought to be able to understand it on his own.Just as he predicted, contempt stained the Viscount's demeanor.\"Dirty bastard,\" Viscount Vig muttered, studiously avoiding Joshua's \"disgusting\" gaze.But the knights' sharp senses could hear him clearly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joshua eventually closed his mouth.Viscount Vig\u2019s voice was lingering in Joshua\u2019s mind for some reason.Considering the total population of the continent, aristocrats were a rarity. Physical ability? Irrelevant. Inherited status, caste, origin, and blood ties determined everything; commoners were less than bugs to the ranking nobles.Still, Joshua\u00a0smiled bitterly.\u201cYou. I\u2019ll watch you,\u201d muttered Viscount Vig with a glimmer of contempt in his eyes before towards the Duke with a sunny expression. \u201cDuke, it\u2019s a little modest, but I humbly prepared dinner\u2026 why don\u2019t we head inside and unwind a little before we set off\u2014\u201d\u201cMy knights are not that weak.\u201d Duke Agnus shook his head firmly. \u201cIf it was a break, everyone would have been too drunk to continue moving. Hmm\u2026 however\u2014ANYONE WANT TO REST?!\u201dWho could say yes before such an intimidating presence?\u201cWe will leave right away.\u201d\u201cPlease allow us to accompany you.\u201d Viscount Vig spat his thoughts out into the open. When subjected to the Duke\u2019s questioning gaze, he continued: \u201cUnfortunately, my abilities are too lacking to handle it myself\u2014but as the Lord of the estate, I can\u2019t just bite my fingers on the sidelines, can I?\u201dDuke Agnus showed a worried expression. Seeing this, Viscount Vig pressed forward.\u201cThe knights and the soldiers gathered are thinking the same thing.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWe want to be of help to the Duke!\u201d\u201cWe are honored to accompany the Duke!\u201dThe shouts of the assembled knights of Locke, in such numbers, filled the air.Duke Agnus sighed.\u201cWhat do you think, Anna?\u201d\u201cOh! You don\u2019t have to worry about her at all! My daughter will certainly be of some help to the Duke.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you want to take this child into that dangerous place too?\u201d The Duke frowned.\u201cSylph.\u201d A gust of wind blew, followed by murmuring. Then, the ground and wind shook.\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d muttered Armand, the 4th-Class wizard.\u201cAs it turns out, I just recently learned that my daughter has a talent for elemental arts!\u201d Viscount Vig stepped forward with a pleased expression.\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus let out a small sigh.Joshua turned to examine Anna. There were only a tiny number of people with a talent like Anna: like magic, the elemental arts are exclusive to those born with the talent\u2014even the lowest rank of Elemental Artists, the junior Elemental Artist, had only a few hundred members across the entire continent.The rarity of Elemental Artists was no different here in the Empire. At that age, with that kind of talent, her renown would quickly spread across the Empire into the entire world. However, this \u201cAnna\u201d was entirely absent from Joshua\u2019s memory.This girl\u2026 her face is familiar, somehow\u2026 Maybe I saw her somewhere\u2026?\u00a0She had a pretty but commonplace visage, yet something about it tickled his memory.Hmm\u2026 Oh?\u00a0Joshua tilted his head. He realized Anna\u2019s gaze was firmly fixed on one place.Babel von Agnus\u2014who, on the other hand, had his eyes still glued to Joshua like he hadn\u2019t even noticed the girl.Babel and this girl\u2014\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go together,\u201d the Duke decided.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cHowever, the Red Knights will take the lead, and the Locke Estate\u2019s forces will be in the rear. The rest of us will stay in the center.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cWe heed and obey!\u201dDuke Agnus nodded.\u201cPrepare to depart immediately!\u201d The troops quickly erupted into a hubbub of preparation.Joshua, however, couldn\u2019t shake the uneasiness lingering in his heart.If it\u2019s someone important enough to affect my plans, I\u2019ll think about it\u2026 For now, we\u2019ll keep moving.\u00a0Joshua set his thoughts aside and followed the Duke towards the gloomy forest.\u201cDepart!\u201dIn the glorious palace of the Avalon Empire, the Iron-Blooded Emperor sat upon his throne.\u201c...I mean, it was\u2026\u201d the Emperor muttered softly to himself, while the man who just delivered his report prostrated before him. The silence stretched for a long moment while the Emperor mused.\u201c\u2014It\u2019s fun!\u201d Marcus burst into laughter. \u201cNot only did he live up to the rumors, he even made the B-Class Knights\u2014the pride of the Empire\u2014back down.\u201dGenuine joy danced on Emperor Marcus\u2019s face.\u201cEvergrant, how did he look to you? We want to hear your personal opinion\u2014not as a knight, but as the greatest wizard in our Empire.\u201d\u201cAs Your Majesty said, it is difficult to make a hasty evaluation. The mana of a wizard and a knight are too different, particularly in the way they exercise it.\u201d\u201cJust your hunch is enough for Us. How far do you think that child will grow?\u201dEvergrant fell into a deep contemplation while the Emperor waited with a patient smile.\u201c...It would be too abstract to speak from the perspective of a wizard, so I\u2019ll use the Imperial Knights as an example.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d The Emperor nodded. He was a swordsman himself, so it was only natural that he would understand it better this way.\u201cFirst: Sir Valmont, who was with me a few days ago. While I just met him in person, I can say that if I ever had the chance to face him in a one-on-one battle\u2014\u201d Evergrant paused. \u201c\u2014I would never be bored.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201d Emperor Marcus nodded eagerly.\u201cValmont is the youngest battalion commander in the Empire\u2014I could count his ilk with my hands and have fingers to spare. Though, Your Majesty could do much better.\u201dEmperor Marcus was the only one who recognized Evergrant in Avalon, a country that habitually disrespected wizards. He was also one of the few people who understood Evergrant\u2019s true skill.1\u201cBut Young Master Joshua? He indeed felt different.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you couldn\u2019t win a fight with him?\u201d The Emperor\u2019s eyes were wide with surprise.\u201cIt certainly felt different, but,\u201d Evergrant shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2026 for now.\u201d\u201cThen you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cWithin the next ten years, possibly sooner, I will begin to lose. That is my sincere feeling.\u201dAstonishment colored the Emperor\u2019s eyes. The wizards were terribly rational beings, and Evergrant was a wizard among wizards.By the way\u2026\u201cAnswer Us one question.\u201d\u201cAnything, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think the outcome would be if you and I had a one-on-one match?\u201dEvergrant\u2019s eyes widened with astonishment. In the end, he could manage no words.\u201c...Ha.\u201d Emperor Marcus eyed Evergrant. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201dHis laughter grew tinged with madness.\u201cTHIS IS FUN! A shame We only could send the prince. If We knew, We would have come to see the child ourselves! If nothing else, We must see the child.\u201dThe Emperor snapped his fingers. A man in black slipped out of the shadows without a sound and prostrated himself before the Emperor.\u201cJaken, can you keep that child tied up here in the Imperial Palace, even for a little while?\u201d\u201cFrom what I know, the Fourth Prince is already preparing to do so.\u201d\u201cKaiser?\u201d Emperor Marcus was surprised.\u201cA little while ago, the Imperial Knights received a letter of recommendation from the Fourth Prince. The subject of the letter was, of course, Young Master Joshua von Agnus.\u201d\u201cA letter of recommendation, you say\u2026 So that\u2019s his way. Although it was made for a specific purpose, the idiot battalions, the 11th and 12th, were bothering Us\u2026\u201d Emperor Marcus\u2019s smirk deepened as he spoke. \u201cReport the progress of that situation regularly.\u201d\u201cI heed and obey, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s perfect for \u2018the job\u2019.\u201dI think what the author is trying to say is that the Emperor has a better grasp of peoples\u2019 power than Evergrant does.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We will stay the night here. SET UP CAMP!\"At the Duke's cry, everyone stopped in their tracks without question\u2014except one.\"D-duke, you're sure we're going to camp here tonight? In a place like this?\" Viscount Vig made a bewildered expression. Ever since they'd departed, Viscount Vig hadn't been able to hide his regret. Though the Locke estate was a barren land, he'd squeezed out a luxurious life on the backs of the hard-working locals. He couldn't bear the thought of living like a vagrant out where monsters could attack at any moment.\"...The report so far had one striking similarity.\"\"What do you mean\u2026?\" Vig tilted his head, drawing a deep sigh from Roben. Even before Duke Agnus had brought up camping, Roben knew what made the Duke uncomfortable. It wasn't just him\u2014all of the knights and soldiers of the Locke estate would understand the meaning of those words. They'd dedicated their lives to stopping the monsters here, after all.But his lord clearly had no awareness of it at all, despite the duties of his position.No\u2026 he's just not interested at all.\u00a0Roben smiled bitterly.\u00a0I've served him for nearly a decade, but Viscount Vig hasn't shown an inkling of care for anything other than his own desires.Whether he understood Roben's thoughts or not, Duke Agnus continued with no change in expression.\"At night, monsters run rampant into the village as if they were possessed\u2026 especially during a blood moon. However, the issue is that they attack even on days when the blood moon doesn't rise.\" Duke Agnus faced the Black Forest with a grim expression. \"Even when the sun rises, it's still dark as night over here\u2026 That's why it's called the 'Black Monster Forest'.\"I don't know if the monsters crawl out of there of their own accord, but there's no reason for us to go in there when we can't maintain visibility and their attacks are intensified.\"\"Aha! That's why you're the Duke!\" The Viscount clapped his hands and encouraged everyone else to do the same. \"I hadn't thought of that. Once again, I am amazed by the Duke's insight and ingenuity. Hahahahahahaha.\"Vig's loud laughter made the knights shift uncomfortably.\"Begin preparing the camp!\" Chiffon shouted through the stiff atmosphere. \"Locke soldiers, assist the knights!\"\"Yes!\"One person had been quietly observing and staying out of sight.This is my chance.\u00a0Joshua edged away from the rest of the group.The group was occupied with setting camp or gathering water and firewood, so no one was paying attention to Joshua.Lugia is preventing the changes to some degree, but I know it's only a temporary measure\u2026 In my current state, the origin stone is absolutely vital for me. In particular\u2014if my memory serves me right\u2014the origin stone can do even more than controlling the rogue energy in my body.I need to go to the deepest place in the Black Forest. It should take an hour to get there.With that decided, Joshua slipped away from the campsite\u2014but there was, in fact, one person who'd kept their eyes on Joshua without him realizing.One pair of eyes gleamed in the light of the setting sun.It's really dark.\u00a0Joshua looked around and frowned.It had been an hour since he entered the Black Forest. A trickle of light had leaked through initially, but the deeper he went the darker it got.Joshua felt his heart shake. Something cried out in front of him\u2014the first monster he'd seen since entering the Black Forest.Black Ogre\u2026!\u00a0The apex predator of the Blak Forest\u2014it had to be twice as big as a typical ogre!Unlike regular ogres, who have very little resistance to magic, a Black Ogre can neutralize all forms of low-level magic. Not only that, its grip is so strong it can tear the toughest troll's skin\u2026Joshua scowled. For now, it was best to avoid the Black Ogre.But the origin stone lies directly in the heart of the forest\u2014and the Black Ogre is blocking the only path there.If it's alone, I can try to take it down all at once!Joshua's eyes lit up with anticipation. Only a B-Class Knight or higher could fight a Black Ogre one-on-one. The Joshua of a few days ago would never have even tried\u2014but the clash with the Imperial Knight during his mana test gave Joshua confidence. Just like back then, if Lugia could contain\u00a0that\u00a0energy on its own, he would be able to kill the Ogre in an instant.Joshua took a sharp breath and slowly approached the Black Ogre.If I approach within ten meters, there's a high chance it will notice and attack me.A moment's mistake could lead to his immediate death. If he didn't finish it in one blow, he might not get a second chance. He raised his five senses to their absolute limits, and his legs tautened to launch him forward at any moment.A little more\u2026\u00a0A cold sweat trickled down Joshua's back.The Ogre stood still and stared into the dark sky. Odd, but, for Joshua, a prime opportunity.Now\u2014Just as he was about to push off, the Black Ogre loosed a wild roar, and its red eyes shone with a vicious light as it lowered its head.Damn this.\u00a0Joshua started to back away.\u00a0How can I face that Black Ogre head-on in my condition? It would be a horrible death.Even as he withdrew into the shrubbery, more problems arose.\"This is crazy\u2014!\" Joshua involuntarily spat a swear.Behind the Black Ogre, dark silhouettes emerged. Dozens\u2014no\u2026 there were hundreds of them!Goblins, kobolds, orcs, even trolls\u2026 All the monstrous inhabitants of the Black Forest crept out, even the famously solitary trolls. He'd been so focused on the Black Ogre that he hadn't looked behind it.If they decide to run over here\u2026The Black Ogre roared, whipping the rest of the monsters into a screaming cacophony. They all moved in the same direction, making the ground tremble under their advance.\"Blood moon!\" Joshua looked up and groaned.My predictions came true.\u00a0Joshua pushed himself deeper into the bushes.\u00a0I don't know about the other monsters, but the kobolds' sense of smell could be dangerous if they get close.Joshua jumped onto a tree and slowly gathered his mana. Instead of pushing his mana into a particular part of the body, this technique would coat his entire body like a cloak. He'd learned this technique from a friend in his past life; it had been a while since he'd tried it, so he wasn't sure if it would work.Halt your breathing and forget your surroundings\u2026 Imagine you're one with the environment\u2026The raging monsters ran right past him.As the monsters flocked to the outskirts of the Black Forest with the Black Ogre in the lead, Joshua only held his breath tighter.If I'm found now, everything is over.Joshua didn't breathe until the monsters had\u2014One of the kobolds in the rear screamed and flicked its head around, bringing the whole mob to a halt.Did I lose my concentration?!Joshua locked eyes with the kobold.Damn it!\u00a0Joshua cussed like never before. The kobolds, or rather the black kobolds, screamed even louder.Ah, I can't help it.\u00a0Joshua unwrapped the mana cloak with a resigned expression.About thirty monsters had trailed behind: mostly black kobolds, with a scattering of orcs mixed in.If that's the case, then\u2026\u00a0Joshua's eyes glittered in the dark.\u00a0I have a better idea.This was an excellent opportunity for him to test the second stage of the Spear Arts, which he'd achieved a few days ago.The monsters were already rushing towards him even as he descended from the tree. He slowly drew Lugia and set his stance.Type J\u2026 A gust of wind rages with a single swing.If the first technique was designed for one-on-one combat, the second technique was effective against multiple enemies.Joshua spun Lugia with both hands like a windmill. When the mana gathering in Lugia reached its peak, Joshua let its name slip from his lips.\"...Thunderstorm.\"The razor-sharp wind swept through the monsters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All he could see were shredded bodies and mulched vegetation. It had all been reduced to a sticky mess by the wind pressure from Lugia. The howling vortex seemed to take on a life of its own, smashing through the forest like a titan's fist.It was a bloody massacre\u2026 Maybe he'd swung Lugia a little too hard?\"Hup!\" Joshua took a short breath and slammed Lugia against the ground. There was a thump like a boulder hitting the ground, and the slowly settling dust was blasted away. Only the whimpers of dying monsters remained to disturb the still air.\"Ah, well\u2026\" A disappointed sigh slipped out of Joshua's lips.I thought I'd mastered level 2, but it seems I'm still far from perfection. It's not even half the original power. A child's body has its limits.His whole body screamed from the excessive mana use, but Joshua had no time to waste.I saw the direction the monsters were going\u2014there's a high chance they'll encounter the campsite soon.Time was of the essence. He had to get the stone and rejoin the group as quickly as possible.It's definitely here.\u00a0Joshua's eyes lit up as he peered into the darkness the monster horde had departed from.As he approached, the confidence in his eyes was slowly replaced by caution. The origin stone had the strange power of attracting all living things, like a sweet siren song. Joshua's finely tuned senses could feel the energy radiating from the origin stone\u2014energy that would give Joshua tremendous power.Joshua stepped into the heart of the forest, eyes dancing with excitement when they landed upon the dark object buried in the forest floor.The entire forest felt tense, as if weighed down by the primordial power practically exploding from the legendary stone. It crackled with black currents of energy as if tapping into the power of the forest itself.\"Bronto.\"The Red Knights and the soldiers of the Locke Estate were enjoying their sweet break time\u2014\"Battle stations!\" A hundred Red Knights hurried into formation at Chiffon's call.\"The Knights of Locke will take their respective positions! Soldiers, cover the knights!\" Roben rallied the thirty-or-so knights and five hundred soldiers that had accompanied them.\"Duke, something is strange.\" Viscount Vig, clearly having just woken up, approached Duke Agnus with a trembling voice.\"Ah, well\u2026\" Duke Agnus licked his dry lips and glanced into the sky.The Blood Moon peeked bashfully back at him from behind the hazy clouds. By all calculations, the Blood Moon shouldn't have risen until midnight of the next day\u2014obviously, though, they'd been wrong.And now we pay the price.Duke Agnus stared at the thousands-strong monster horde approaching them.\"A knight should never lose his composure, neither in fortune nor failure.\"The humming of voices fell silent as Duke Agnus spoke.\"Just show the skills you've trained all this time, and\u2026\" Duke Agnus took a careful look at the knights. \"...follow my lead.\"A rush of adrenaline flooded their veins.\"The Duke is with us!\" Chiffon was the first to voice his excitement.The air was quickly filled with their shouts.\"The Duke is with us!\"\"YAHHHHHH!\"\"The proud men of Locke shall also go forth!\" Even Viscount Vig, who wore a perpetually terrified expression, puffed his chest up and stepped forward.\"YAHHHH!\" The troops of Locke jostled each other, overcome by the mood. Viscount Vig grinned, buoyed by their confidence.Duke Agnus turned slowly to face the horde.\"Captain, we\u2014\"\"Please hold.\" Chiffon raised his hand to stop his subordinate, who looked ready to jump out at any second.\"Yes? But\u2014\"\"The Duke has not issued orders.\"The young Red Knight turned to watch Duke Agnus intently. For an instant, he seemed to shiver, and then his sword appeared in his hands. A dark blur of movement split the air in front of him\u2014something had been cut, though no one had seen the sword move.\"Uh\u2026 sooner or later\u2026\" The knight was a promising young talent in his early thirties who had recently reached the expert level, yet he hadn't felt the Duke move at all.But what happened next was even more astounding: hundreds of creatures, well over 20 meters away, erupted into a chorus of screams as they were split in two. Their halved bodies tumbled to the ground, staining it with blood and viscera.\"That slash\u2026\" Chiffon mumbled blankly.At first glance, the move was simple, but these were godlike actions only another Master could duplicate. Even then, Chiffon was sure that they wouldn't be able to match his master's sheer power. His overwhelming strength stunned even the simple-minded beasts; nowhere else could you see a monster cowering before a human being.\"Young Master! That is your father: Aden von Agnus!\" Viscount Vig shouted at Babel with a flushed face. The boy quivered with growing excitement, though he didn't show it on his face. \"You, who inherited his blood, will surely be like that too! Ah!\"No matter how much of a monster you are, you're still a child. No doubt it's surprising to see this for the first time.\u00a0Viscount Vig smiled as he misinterpreted Babel's trembling.Isn't he a lovely nephew?\u00a0He was an infinitely caring uncle to Babel. Vig knew Babel would be a big help to him in the future.Wait\u2026 come to think of it\u2026\u00a0A startling notion brought a frown to his face. He snapped around but couldn't find what he was looking for.Viscount Vig cautiously approached Chiffon, his frown deepening.\"Sir Chiffon, where is that trash\u2014ah, no. Where is that child?\"\"What do you mean, 'that child'?\" Chiffon cocked his head quizzically.\"I mean, the bastard who said his name was 'Joshua'?\"\"Ah!\" Chiffon nodded in understanding and peeked around. \"Yes. Come to think of it\u2026 I can't see him either.\"\"I guess he ran away and left us all to die, did he? This lowly thing. Tsk.\"The knights could clearly hear Viscount Vig's voice in the peculiar lull created by Duke Agnus's attack.\"What? Did he really run away?\"\"No matter how young he is, I haven't seen him once.\"\"Hah, I knew it. He really was different from Young Master Babel.\"\"He's really acting like this\u2014the blood of the Duke no less!\"Little by little, the murmurs of discontent swelled.\u00a0Noblesse oblige\u2014yet the person who should be leading by example was the first to flee. Joshua's reputation was tarnished.\"What are you doing? There are enemies before us!\" The Duke's thunderous voice drew them back to the present.\"Glory to Agnus!\"\"The Duke is with us!\"\"Raise your swords!\"Duke Agnus advanced towards the reeling monsters as the knights prepared to do battle. Just as the horde looked like it had lost the will to fight, a thunderous roar kicked up a dense cloud of dust behind the beasts.\"Black Ogre!\"The Black Ogre emerged from the forest and casually reduced a kobold into mincemeat. The terrified monsters began to edge towards the knights again.\"It's\u2026\" Chiffon's face fell. This could have ended as a minor incident, but that was all in vain.We will have no choice but to confront the monsters head-on like we'd planned.Duke Agnus had remained stoic through it all, but now:This energy\u2026?\u00a0For the first time, his countenance was shaken.Something\u00a0dark\u00a0erupted from behind the monsters' ranks.\"I\u2014 That\u2014!\" Chiffon boggled at the sight. \"Joshua\u2026 Young Master Joshua?\"Before the eyes of the assembled knights, Joshua fell from the sky like a bolt of lightning.\"Thunderbolt.\"With a deafening roar, white lightning struck the Black Ogre's head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The rampaging Black Ogre, rumored to be invulnerable to anything less than an expert knight, slowly parted down the middle. Joshua stood before it, engulfed in pure white currents of electricity.\"He, he, he\u2014!\" The Viscount pointed a trembling finger at him.He fell from the sky like an angel bathed in blood.Did he just do that? A Black Ogre, over five meters tall? It doesn't matter how he was raised\u2014how is it possible for a child to split something several times his size in a single blow?It had to be impossible\u2026 Yes\u2026 clearly impossible.\u00a0Viscount Vig looked around and saw that the reactions of the knights were not that different from his.Joshua was examined by untrusting eyes.This trashy kid\u2026 He hid it until now so he could use this situation to flex. What kind of attitude is that?\"The Duke even defeated the ferocious Black Ogre in one blow!\" shouted Viscount Vig, eyes wild. \"What are the men of Locke doing? Help the Duke, quickly!\"The knights heard his voice and nodded to themselves as if saying, \"As expected.\"\"No matter how talented the Young Master is, a C-Class Knight is not able to defeat a Black Ogre. Everyone knows a B-Class Knight would struggle.\"\"It was just convenient timing.\"\"Everyone, help the Duke! Wipe out the rest of the monsters!\"\"Yes!\"Joshua giggled as he watched the knights advance\u2014he'd heard everything they'd said.So, I'm just a shallow child to them.His father, Duke Aden von Agnus, locked eyes with him from across the battlefield.You're hurting my self-esteem\u2026 I expected him to show a little surprise, but it seems like he totally expected it, that monster. I don't like that at all.I've already used Thunderbolt before\u2014I must have not left a strong enough impression on them.\"Let me surprise you a little.\" Joshua gripped Lugia, still in its rod form, and twisted his waist. His mana gathered once more. A child's body definitely couldn't handle this technique twice in a row, but, with a portion of Bronto's power, he might pull through.Even if I fall, that monster will save me.The key to this technique was \"perfect balance.\" Unlike Thunderbolt, which concentrates every iota of mana to a single point, this skill spreads its power evenly throughout the length of the spear. The sensation of the spear in his hand was significantly different.Joshua smiled savagely as pure white sparks spewed off of him.\"Thunderstorm,\" he whispered, and swung Lugia from left to right.Laser-straight lines of crystalline lightning stitched across the air with a flash of white, one after the other. They fanned out in all directions, embroidering the air in crackling electricity.Is this what a falling star looks like?\u00a0The lovely lights left the audience agape, but the result was anything but.The horrific howling of the monsters curdled the air. Winds of lighting-like force ripped them apart, leaving them scorched, shredded, and scattered by its passing.Whoaaa, heeheehee heeheehee.It was a mad, mad wind that struck with a life of its own.When the winds settled, only one person one left standing in the storm's path: Joshua, a boy a mere fraction the size of the slain monsters.\"My word\u2026 This is absurd\u2026\" Viscount Vig fell to the ground, shaking all over. He didn't have the courage to stay standing in the face of such frightening power.\"Hey\u2026 humor me here\u2026 This is the skill of a C-Class Knight, right?\"\"No! I've never seen or heard of any mana user that can use elemental attributes like that!\"\"You mean it was Young Master Joshua who actually took out the Black Ogre? Its skin shouldn't even be scratched unless it's attacked by a B-Class Knight.\"The knights were abuzz with speculation.\"I wonder if Young Master Joshua is a magic swordsman\u2026\"\"Wha\u2014 'Magic swordsman'?\"Under the known theories of mana, a magic swordsman was regarded as impossible\u2014but how else could you explain Joshua's feat?\"\u2014Kill the rest of the monster!\" Chiffon clenched his teeth and infused his voice with mana to drag the knights back to reality.\"Assist Young Master Joshua!\"\"Wipe them out!\"Now, no more than half of the monsters remained. The rest, already taken by fear, fell under the knights' swords in droves.\"What do you think, Armand?\" Duke Agnus's low, sunken eyes gazed steadily at Joshua, unperturbed by the chaos around him.Even Armand, a 4th-Class Wizard, had never encountered such a thing in his many experiences. It took him a long time to gather an answer.\"Magicians believe that only one in ten thousand is so blessed; only the truly chosen can use this gift from the gods.\" Armand paused. \"\u2026We call it \"Double Casting\", the power two wield two magics at the same time. It requires you to know the intricate formulae by memory. Most high-ranking wizards of 5th-Class or higher can do it, but that kind of talent is a blessing from the gods in its own way.\"In terms of power alone, the power Young Master Joshua just demonstrated is similar to the 3rd circle magic, Chain Lightning\u2014No. Not even Chain Lightning is so complex. I don't know if you could achieve the same results with several casts of Wind Cutter and Chain Lightning at the same time\u2026\"Armand pressed his lips into a thin line.\"What are you trying to say?\"\"\u2026As a wizard, I can roughly understand what the knights are training for, but I can't understand their true abilities. Young Master Joshua, however\u2026 If he's a 'magic swordsman', as the knights say, he must be equivalent to a 3rd-Class Wizard at least. A genius C-Class Knight that can use Double Casting.\"He would be a monster. A monster that could single-handedly rewrite the history of the continent.\"Joshua stood proud and tall at the heart of the battlefield, but, from Duke Agnus's perspective, his position was perilous\u2014both of his legs trembled and threatened to collapse.So, you don't want to reveal your frail side\u2026\"I see what you're saying.\" Duke Agnus chuckled and then disappeared from his spot. He appeared behind Joshua, supporting his small body.\"Blood doesn't lie,\" Armand muttered as he watched the Young Master collapse into his father's arms.To be gifted in such a way\u2026 I honestly didn't think it was possible.\u00a0A trump card to finally fulfil the master's deepest wish.\"Duke\u2014!\"The Blood Moon, rising high over the carnage, shone brighter than ever before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to move, but\u2026 I feel so tired.It felt as if he was looking down from outside his body, like a ghost.\u2026A dream?As soon as he realized he was in a dream, the landscape exploded into crimson flames. Joshua recognized this place from his past and his present.The Agnus Duchy\u2026!\u00a0Duke Agnus\u2019s grand palace, rivaling the splendor of the Imperial Palace, was ablaze. One figure, sword in hand, stood with his back to the smoldering castle.Aden von Agnus? No\u2026 not him. The man wielded the Duke\u2019s signature magenta greatsword, but that face\u2026Babel von Agnus.\u00a0His son. The heir of the Duke, in his first life. This wasn\u2019t the prepubescent boy Joshua knew now, but a fully grown man.Is this what the Duchy looked like when it was destroyed? It should have happened in ten years, so why\u2026?\u00a0The razing of the Agnus Duchy shouldn\u2019t happen for a long time\u2014what\u2019s more, Joshua had not seen it happen. He only heard it long after he\u2019d abandoned the Duchy and taken up mercenary work.But what does this dream mean, then? Is it an oracle?I can make an educated guess: I recently obtained a new ability\u2014this dream is most certainly connected to it.Babel von Agnus staggered forwards. His body dripped with crimson blood, but he never slowed down.Two people stood in opposition. Though the clamor of battle filled the manor, the three seemed to stand in a bubble of calm. Their voices were inaudible as if enchanted to silence, but Joshua\u2019s vision seemed to become unnaturally sharp in exchange.One man and one woman. The man\u2019s face was cloudy and obscured, but the woman\u2019s face was clear. A young woman, in her thirties or so; the brown hair the Igrant continent was known for; a gorgeous body even her robes couldn\u2019t conceal. She wasn\u2019t beautiful, but her face would draw a second look.Wait\u2026 that\u2019s the girl\u2026\u00a0Surely this was the girl he knew as \u201cAnna\u201d?\u201cAHH!\u201d Babel howled in a fit of rage. The woman\u2019s face contorted murderously, and she waved her hand. Her actions were light, but the results were anything but.A short scream was torn from Babel\u2019s lungs as a gale ripped his battered body to shreds. Silion, a superior wind spirit that took on the form of a translucent lion, revealed its true nature through Babel\u2019s scattered blood.Anna Bell Grace.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s skin dimpled with goosebumps.\u00a0What the hell is going on with that girl? Why is she here?I must check.\u00a0Silion\u2019s appearance dredged up memories of a certain someone\u2014Anna\u2019s teacher was\u00a0that man.Even in a dream, he drove Joshua to the verge of madness.I can\u2019t see him!\u00a0His blood boiled. He felt so powerless when answers were right in front of him.\u00a0Damn it!His face, his voice\u2014nothing. Only his foggy outline indicated there was anyone there at all.\u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\u201d Babel reached the limits of his grief and loosed a deafening scream. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he bled to death then and there.The man raised his hand, dissipating the spirits like a lie. He approached Babel\u2019s kneeling form and opened his mouth to speak.\u201cDo you believe the Agnus name can halt a tide like this?\u201d His voice came through first\u2014then, slowly but surely, his face began to clear. He raised his hands to the heavens, drawing Silion into a new form.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dAmidst Babel\u2019s anguished screams, the man\u2019s face was finally revealed.Just as Joshua opened his mouth to cry out, the world erupted into dazzling white light.\u201cDraxia Bell Grace\u2026!\u201dJoshua inhaled sharply and blinked his eyes open. The first thing that greeted him was the magnificent chandelier; gradually, his surrounding became clear.\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d Joshua scowled as he looked around.Intense aches wracked his body. Joshua sighed as he recollected what had happened just before he passed out.My body still struggles with it?He had progressed well beyond the first stage of his spear arts, but he had also acquired new abilities he hadn\u2019t had in his past life. Being unable to absorb those powers on his own placed far too many constraints on him.However, it lends me significant strength. The second stage of the magic spear arts is roughly equivalent to the highest levels of a C-Class Knight. However, in terms of monster fighting, it could contend with an entry-level B-Class Knight.Bronto\u2026\u00a0The origin stone with the attribute of thunder. Unlike the other stones, Bronto was relatively small. It constantly shot bolts of lightning in all directions.\u00a0I swallowed it whole, so it might have burned my stomach\u2026Joshua couldn\u2019t help but giggle at how ridiculous that sounded.Bronto\u2019s strength\u2026 Is it truly all about possessing the right qualities?\u00a0In his last life, the great tower\u2019s magicians had not gleaned the true nature of the origin stones even after nearly a century of study.\u00a0Perhaps I just won\u2019t tell the world\u2026But if that dream was actually a new property of Bronto\u2026 Joshua absolutely had to investigate. That kind of ability went beyond personal power.I\u2019d like to learn a little more about the other origin stones,\u00a0thought Joshua.Having settled his thoughts, Joshua gingerly raised himself up. The pain was tolerable but still present.Then he saw the Duke standing at the window, silhouetted by the pale moonlight.\u201cDuke?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you intrigued?\u201d The Duke slowly turned around.\u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0What kind of question is that? Where\u2019s the context?\u201cOnly a few hours ago, the light of the blood moon seemed to devour the entire world\u2014now it bathes it in such cold, serene moonlight.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Joshua followed Duke Agnus\u2019s gaze out the window. They both basked in the cool, clear light for a moment.\u201cYou will depart for Arcadia as soon as you return. As I stated, you will no longer be \u2018Joshua von Agnus\u2019. You will be the only son of the troubled Viscount Frederick, a fallen nobleman trying to resurrect his shattered family.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Joshua nodded firmly. He agreed with the plan\u2014no good could come from attracting attention while he regained his strength.\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s aura clamped down on his body. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you were sleep talking or not, but you mentioned a quite amusing name.\u201dDuke Agnus\u2019s eyes glittered brighter than the icy moonlight.\u201c\u2019Draxia Bell Grace\u2019. Hmph. How did you come across that cursed name?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first was Viscount Vig; the second was\u2026\"Sir Chiffon, does sister Vanessa know about this?\"\"She is well aware.\"Vig grimaced.\"Was it just recognizing that 'it\" could jeopardize their position in the future?\"\"They couldn't do anything about it; they didn't even have a chance to respond.\"\"Is there anything else to it? This is the first time I've even heard of him!\" Vig furrowed his eyebrows. \"Do you have any more information on him?\"\"That's not surprising. He was a dung cleaner till not long ago.\"\"What?\" Vig couldn't believe it.\"He wasn't allowed to set foot inside the mansion since he was born. Then he had this huge aptitude for mana before he was even ten years old, like everything else was all a lie.\"\"How does that make any sense?\"It's fine. I can't believe it, and I don't want to believe it\u2014but let's say, as Lord Chiffon said, he really was born with such great skill: did he really achieve it himself?\"Young Master Babel grew up taking many elixirs, systematically managed, and personally mentored by the Duke, and he became a mana user at the age of fourteen! Today he's recognized as the Empire's finest talent\u2026 but then that horseshit bastard showed up\u2026\" Vig trailed off into a dejected sigh.He\u2014the child of a maid, no less\u2014had more talent than his beloved nephew.I wouldn't say anything if I didn't see it with my own two eyes. I simply refuse to believe it.\"Let me ask you something.\" Vig's eyes lit up.\"Say it.\"\"I heard he was recognized as a C-Class Knight by the Imperial family only a few days ago.\"\"That's true.\"\"All C-Class Knights are the same when it comes to the monsters in the Black Forest. Is there anyone else who can make the same claims as Joshua?\"Chiffon's face tightened.Is that a skill a C-Class Knight can boast of?\u00a0No. Joshua was godlike. It's simply impossible for anyone else\u2014only a B-Class technique could have such a widespread effect.If I think about it, he might be able to do it right now\u2026 The other knights must be saying the same thing.A magic swordsman\u2026 should be impossible with all known conventions of mana utilizations. A swordsman creates a mana hall in his lower belly, while magicians form their mana into a ring around their heart. Having both at once would cause them to continually clash, making it entirely impossible to control your mana.Well, it's not like it doesn't exist at all\u2026\u00a0One lord of the Nine Stars; a high-ranking magician, but also an Absolute of Master status.Only a few people are born each generation with such an unusual constitution. That's why magical swordsmen are a rarity throughout history\u2014but did that child have such a lucky constitution?It was virtually impossible without divine providence.\"I've thought about it for a long time. I can tell you're serious just by the look on your face.\"I don't think he's a wizard with a sword. You'd have to be at least a 3rd-Class Wizard, according to Armand, to display that kind of power. Is it even true he did all that? The opposite would be more believable.\"\"\u2026But what if he did?\"\"One day, he awoke with tremendous power. Do you understand?\"\"No way\u2026\" Chiffon's eyes widened.\"It's conceivable he made a contract with a demon\u2014even a high-ranking demon in the top 100.\"\"That's\u2014!\" Chiffon gaped at him. The Viscount was making some dangerous claims. The affairs of demons, warlocks, and the Demon Realm were best kept to the shadows. Their reign of terror, brief as it was, swept across the continent like a savage wind.\"People were taken aback, even in Karius. I'm confident there are 'Demons of Lightning' who can wield the thunder attribute.\"\"This is ridiculous! All of the Imperial Knights, including the Duke, have already recognized Young Master Joshua. I was there too. The magicians\u2014\"\"It doesn't really matter if he made a deal with a demon or not.\"Now, Chiffon understood what Viscount Vig was driving at.\"It's amazing what a nine-year-old bastard can do. Are you certain that Aden von Agnus will be succeeded by Young Master Babel?\"\"That\u2014\" Chiffon struggled for words.I don't want to admit it, but even I was astonished.\u00a0Indeed, what he saw that day was bordered on the divine.\"Fortunately, I don't believe his mentality is as mature as his gift. Kids his age don't know how to hide their power\u2014they just want to flaunt it. So, I just have to prove that his immature actions will put his life in jeopardy.\"Vig's deeply buried eyes glittered in the dim lamplight.\"I don't know what sister Vanessa is thinking. I'll say it again: I'm not sure what she's\u00a0really\u00a0thinking. But even if he immediately departs for Arcadia, there's still a way to get to him.\"\"What?\"\"My daughter will also be attending the Imperial Academy.\"\"Ah, yes.\" Chiffon nodded with understanding.\"Sir Chiffon, I'd like you to pay closer attention to this part, however you choose to approach it. If that child wants to claim succession\u2026 it's going to be a nightmare. Before that happens, we need to get our hands on him.\"I'm confident you'll be ready.\"Vig stood up and walked out of the room, leaving Chiffon alone.\"A demon\u2026\"The day the Red Knight returned from the Locke Territory, the first grand dinner in a long time was held in the Agnus Estate to congratulate them on their safe return and to pray for the safety of those who would soon be departing.Joshua wasn't one for those kinds of things and slipped away.\"Is it okay for today's protagonist to run away, master?\"\"Your choice of words is interesting. 'Master'.\" Joshua chuckled at Cain. \"Don't you think it would raise eyebrows if someone heard?\"Until they swore the \"Knight's Oath\", all knights of the Agnus Duchy belonged to Duke Agnus and Duke Agnus only.\"It's not like I'm making things up.\" Cain shrugged. \"This makes my heart ache\u2026 and so, I now appoint you as my lord.\"\"Don't I get a choice? You do know that I can decline the Knight's Oath?\"\"I don't believe my master would deny the subordinate who will become his closest aide.\"\"\u2026 You're more daring than I had imagined.\"\"I appreciate the compliment,\" Cain said with a wide grin. Joshua could only shake his head.When they arrived before Joshua's chambers, Cain looked around carefully before politely bowing his head.\"Please rest comfortably. And\u2026 I meant what I said. Beyond even your enormous abilities, I believe you have incredible potential. I hope you will grant me the privilege of serving under someone like you.\"Joshua stared down at Cain's head and smiled.\"I'll think about it.\"Not bad.\u00a0Joshua watched Cain walk away before reaching for the doorknob.\u00a0Not bad at all.Even in his past life, a fair number of people gathered around him. Of course, Joshua had gently pushed them away\u2014he'd promised himself he would spend the rest of his life under the one who had protected him. Joshua thought he would be on the alert for people flocking to Joshua, particularly those superior to his own ability.That's why I got rid of them, but\u2026\u00a0Joshua chewed on his lip.\u00a0Kaiser, why?His heart shook. Broken friendship, broken trust.Naturally, his mind went to the conversation he'd had with the Duke the night before.Draxia Bell Grace.\u00a0A man he'd once called friend.\"Damn it.\" His grip on the doorknob tightened. A searing headache was pressing down on his skull.I just want to go to sleep.\"Young Master Joshua?\" An old butler had come up behind him with a troubled expression. \"Are you feeling unwell?\"\"I'm fine,\" he said. He tried to push the door open.\"The table is set for Young Master Joshua,\" the butler ventured. \"Everyone is looking forward to you\u2014\"\"If that's the case, could you please inform them that I'm not feeling well and won't be able to attend?\" Joshua didn't bother to turn around.\"This isn't a dinner party,\" said the butler with a shake of his head. \"This dinner is prepared for you by Duchess Vanessa.

The first thing he saw through the open door was a middle-aged beauty with piercing eyes and arched brows. And next to her:\u201cMother\u2014\u201d\u201cJoshua?\u201d Lucia was startled by Joshua\u2019s sudden appearance. Vanessa, at the table\u2019s head, and Chiffon, next to her, didn\u2019t seem bothered.\u201cYou\u2019re Joshua, right? Is this the first time you\u2019ve seen something like this?\u201d Vanessa greeted him with a grin, but Joshua didn\u2019t reply.\u201cYoung Master Joshua, you stand before the lady of the Agnus family. Be courteous.\u201d Chiffon scowled at him.Still, Joshua remained silent.\u201cYoung Master Joshua!\u201d Chiffon exclaimed.Joshua\u2019s eyes snapped onto Chiffon for a moment, and his body quaked with shivers.What kind of eyes does that boy have?\u00a0Chiffon\u2019s throat quivered. Before those eyes, all pretensions of etiquette were blown away; nothing was left but primordial instinct.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you say your greetings, Joshua?\u201d Lucia looked him up and down with a worried expression.Joshua groaned.\u201cI am Joshua von Agnus. I greet the Duchess.\u201dVanessa twitched. Was he disrespectful? No. She was bothered by the way he used the name \u201cAgnus\u201d. However, the Duchess recovered quickly.\u201cI heard you\u2019re departing for the capital shortly. I was a little worried since I feel like I\u2019ve never properly gotten to know you.\u201d\u201c\u2014Arcadia? Are you talking about Arcadia, Duchess?\u201d Lucia\u2019s eyes flew wide open.\u201cJust call me \u2018Sister\u2019,\u201d Vanessa said.\u201cOh my God, how dare I\u2014\u201d Lucia stuttered with a confused expression. Both were Duke Agnus\u2019s mistresses, but their standings were as different as heaven and earth. Vanessa, descended from the noblest blood in the Avalon Empire, and Lucia, nothing more than a maid; in any other situation, it would be unthinkable to even look each other in the eye.Vanessa\u2019s demeanor made Lucia feel ashamed. She\u2019d never treated Lucia so well before.\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard anything yet?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe Duke said he\u2019d take my younger sister1\u00a0and Joshua with him when he returned to the capital.\u201d\u201cAh, what exactly do you mean?\u201d\u201cJoshua is a Knight.\u201d Chiffon stepped up to fill in the holes.Lucia stared blankly at Joshua.\u201cThis is a sore spot for me, because it looks like I never invited anyone to dinner\u2026 Don\u2019t you think I\u2019d be such a jerk to leave you like this?\u201d Vanessa grinned.\u201cMy, Duchess, don\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cYou called me\u00a0that\u00a0again.\u201d Vanessa furrowed her brows.\u201cSister\u2026 sister.\u201d\u201cPlease accept my apologies for neglecting you. If there is any lingering ill will, it is my wish that those feelings be laid to rest.\u201d\u201cThere are no grudges! You\u2019ve been so gracious to extend this hospitality to us!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Vanessa clapped her hands together with a bright smile. \u201cPlease prepare the table as soon as possible.\u201dThe door opened, and platters poured in one by one.\u201cIs your seat uncomfortable?\u201d Vanessa asked Joshua. \u201c You haven\u2019t looked this nice in a long time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite inconvenient.\u201dVanessa was puzzled by Joshua's immediate answer.\u201cYoung Master Joshua!\u201d Chiffon couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201dChiffon flinched like he\u2019d been bitten. His hand instinctively dropped to his belt.This!\u00a0His cheeks flushed. The implications of being chastised by this youngster\u2014!\u201cYou disgraceful\u2026!\u201dAlarm bells rang in Chiffon\u2019s head as the energy around Joshua\u2019s body thickened. Chiffon prepared to draw his sword.Swordsmanship isn\u2019t something you acquire just by growing up. Only the talented can learn it. So\u2026Cold sweat trickled down Chiffon\u2019s back like he was facing down a B-Class Knight.Joshua seemed completely centered, like the emotions of other people meant nothing to him. It seemed as if he was in control of his life, somehow.\u201cSeeing as you\u2019re ready to draw your blade, it appears Sir Chiffon has a short temper\u2014\u201d\u201cJoshua!\u201dJoshua ground to a halt when he realized who was there. Chiffon let out a long breath like he\u2019d been scrubbed clean. Vanessa grimaced, and Lucia looked annoyed.If they\u2019d been left alone\u2026\u201cStop it, Sir Chiffon,\u201d said the Duchess.\u201cWhat impoliteness is this, Joshua?\u201d said Lucia.\u201cSir Chiffon, may we speak for a moment?\u201d Vanessa locked eyes with Chiffon.\u201cI understand, Your Highness.\u201dVanessa rose gently and turned to Lucia.\u201cWait for just a moment,\u201d said the hostess. \u201cYou can eat first.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Lucia didn\u2019t have time to reply before they walked out the door.\u201cJoshua, what\u2019s the matter with you? What do they mean when they say you\u2019re going to the capital? What about becoming a knight\u2014?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dLucia came to an abrupt halt when she saw the genuine remorse on Joshua\u2019s face.\u201cShould I wait until later to hear what happened?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAll right\u2014\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201dLucia cocked her head curiously.\u201cFor the time being, I hope you\u2019ll trust me.\u201d\u201cJoshua?\u201d Lucia was confused by Joshua\u2019s stern expression.His eyes were more frigid than they\u2019d ever been.Vanessa turned around once she\u2019d gone some distance from the dining room.\u201cSir Chiffon, what are we going to do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201d\u201cStop blaming others.\u201d\u201cMy apologies.\u201d Chiffon bowed.\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re acting so cruelly, Sir Chiffon.\u201d Vanessa glared at him with poisonous eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting a small child.\u201dI remember the first time I saw that boy.\u00a0From the depths of his heart, rage swelled. Animosity, without reason. He didn\u2019t understand that emotion until now.\u00a0Isn\u2019t this envy?I don\u2019t want to admit it, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. Damn it.\u00a0Chiffon chewed his lip. An unbelievable talent, superior to his beloved master, and a profound sense of dignity that draws people in.\u201cDon\u2019t be influenced by irrational feelings,\u201d the Duchess said. \u201cIf you wanted to see good things, you may be out of luck.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThose things just arrived yesterday,\u201d replied the Duchess.Chiffon stared wide-eyed at her.\u201cGari\u201d was a well-known poison among the knights. It was a pure white powder that was nearly tasteless and odorless, even to the highly developed senses of knights.Gari might work.\u201cEven for a mere best, the last road is a comfortable one,\u201d Vanessa said as she made her way slowly back to the dining room. \u201cKnight? Arcadia? It\u2019s not even funny. I don\u2019t think a bug could be better than him.\u201dVanessa\u2019s smile was as cold as ice.\u201cThis time, don\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d\u201cHave you been waiting for us\u2026 Was I holding you back? I\u2019m ashamed we\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just so cozy!\u201dVanessa flashed a bright smile at Lucia\u2019s reply before looking at Joshua.\u201cI offered Sir Chiffon some harsh advice; I hope you\u2019re satisfied by it as well.\u201dVanessa sat down and examined the food set on the table. Peculiarly, extra food was placed in front of Lucia and Joshua\u2014Vanessa's intentions were, of course, hidden within.\u201cSister Lucia, I hope your seats aren\u2019t bothering you or your child?\u201d\u201cNot at all! We\u2019re fine.\u201d Lucia spoke loudly, as if unsure of herself.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled!\u201d Vanessa smiled. \u201cThank god. I was afraid my sister would despise me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Lucia. She leapt to her feet like a frightened rabbit.\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Vanessa covered her mouth bashfully. \u201cI want to get to know my younger sister a little better.\u201dAlthough I wasn\u2019t criticized openly, I had to sleep with one eye open for years.\u00a0Lucia was greatly moved. It was only natural she would feel reassured by the first warm words offered to her.\u201cShall we eat, then?\u201dLucia nodded brightly.\u201cThen\u2014\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d The voice filled the dining room, instantly capturing the guests\u2019 attention.Joshua\u2019s lips curled into a tiny smile.\u201cBefore we eat, I\u2019d like to express my regret. I had no idea there was a deeper meaning, and I was oversensitive.\u201d He rose from his seat and bowed. \u201cPlease accept my heartfelt apologies.\u201d\u201cAll is well.\u201d Vanessa seemed perplexed but smiled and nodded. Lucia, too, was smiling.\u201cIt appears my young mind has accumulated useless poisons,\u201d Joshua continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think my elder mother thinks like I do. If we\u2019d known ahead of time, we would have prepared something ourselves\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too late.\u201dJoshua grinned widely at Vanessa\u2019s reply.\u201cI appreciate you saying that, but you reached out first\u2014\u201d Joshua pointed at the table. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this kind of treatment from you.\u201d\u201cHey, Joshua, what do you mean?\u201d Lucia shifted uncomfortably.\u201cMother, it appears my elder mother is overly concerned about us. She only receives a small portion of the food, while we have so much.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dIndeed, delicacies were piled high in front of them. Vanessa\u2019s cheeks flushed with unease as Joshua continued to push her.Joshua drew an angelic smile on his lips as he pressed the attack home.\u201cElder mother, I hope we can\u00a0all\u00a0enjoy our last dinner together.\u201dFor the first time, Vanessa\u2019s perfect smile cracked.Lucia.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His life came under threat hundreds, if not thousands, of times; every time was unique in its own way. Pursued by the continent's finest guild of assassins, backstabbed by a trusted subordinate\u2026Poison was, of course, among them. Joshua was confident that few people had fallen victim to as many poisons as he had.Joshua was never one to rely on his subordinates when he could be taking the initiative. By the time one of his subordinates had killed one person, Joshua had killed ten, or twenty, or more. His aggressiveness left his body a wreck on the inside and outside. He was always on the front lines, meeting the enemy's blows head-on.It's gari.\u00a0Joshua burst out laughing. Gari's greatest strength was its subtlety. Gari gradually drained its victims rather than melting organs like other infamous poisons. It took roughly a week for symptoms to manifest, making it very difficult to find evidence. Additionally, its properties were difficult to identify as poison.Joshua knew a truly odorless, colorless poison would be invented by the famous alchemists of Fordran's southernmost kingdom after decades of research. However, that wouldn't happen until far in the future\u2014at the very least, Joshua was confident it wasn't in his food right now.But for now, Gari is worth its weight in gold, and he's put in a lot.It's been expertly blended into the seasoning, and the plates have been carefully arranged to only target the right people.As expected, Joshua couldn't see signs of gari in Vanessa's food. The Duchess kept smiling, as she always had.I look forward to seeing that expression twist.\"Since this is the first time the entire family is sharing a meal, how about we all enjoy it together, elder mother?\"Vanessa's facade was already melting. Joshua's heart buzzed with excitement the more he saw.\"That\u2026 It's not always easy\u2026 I've gained a lot of weight recently, so I'm paying more attention to my diet.\"\"Is my elder mother afraid of something?\" Joshua shot the Duchess an innocent, wide-eyed look. \"Is it really worth the effort of worrying about? You're already stunning.\"This brat is really\u2014!\u00a0Vanessa sighed deeply.\u00a0I was almost convinced he already knew everything\u2014No, maybe he does. Rumor has it he's intelligent enough to conceal his abilities for years\u2026Vanessa's uneasiness grew as the idea festered in her mind. What if this cunning boy said he wouldn't eat unless the Duchess did?\"Isn't it all over when I depart for the capital? This time, let's eat together so my mother can relax and enjoy herself.\"Vanessa had an overwhelming urge to smash her fists into the boy's smug face.\"What's the matter? Is it possible the meal was poisoned?\" Joshua belted out a long laugh.\"Young Master Joshua, you're overdoing it!\" Chiffon stepped forward when he saw Vanessa's flustered expression.\"Such impoliteness! What kind of joke is that? This is poison we're talking about!\"\"Yes, son, the Duchess took special care to prepare this dinner!\" Lucia chided Joshua and turned to Vanessa. \"Please accept my apologies. Joshua, what are you doing instead of apologizing?\"Lucia's urgency grew as she saw Vanessa's expression stiffen.I had no intention of getting involved in the war of succession of a soon-to-be-destroyed family, and I certainly didn't want to make new enemies.But these people had crossed the line.I could put up with it if I was the only one who received their silly anger.But these people had laid their hands on someone they never should have even looked at.\"Impolite\u2026 You were probably thinking the same thing.\"\"Uh, what\u2014\"\"I have a question.\" Joshua looked Chiffon dead in the eyes. \"Do you have any idea who I am?\"Chiffon stiffened. He hadn't even stopped to think about it earlier.\"I suppose your silence is an answer.\"Chiffon's lips remained tightly sealed. Even if Joshua was scum born from the lowest blood, Chiffon couldn't dispute that he was directly descended from the master.\"What do you think, elder mother?\"Vanessa met Joshua's gaze and shivered.\"I was joking, but Sir Chiffon's reaction makes it seem like it's not a joke.\" Joshua's eyes glowed with a dangerous light.\"Did you really poison it?\"\"This- this, this\u2014!\" Chiffon couldn't take it anymore and drew his blade just before Vanessa lost control. \"I can't let this go any longer, no matter how much of the master's blood you have! Contempt of the Imperial family is grounds for immediate execution!\"\"You dare\u2026?\" Joshua growled at Chiffon.Am I\u2026 nervous?\u00a0Chiffon received the full brunt of Joshua's laser-sharp focus. He\u00a0knew\u00a0the gap between a C- and B-Class Knight was insurmountable, but instinct was taking over.\"Don't mess with me!\" he screeched. His mana poured out in all directions like a small bomb. Chiffon's heart felt as safe as a lie as he lashed out with the deep blue mana rising from his mana hall.\"Die,\" Joshua mumbled. A long iron staff blinked into existence in Joshua's hand.Built-in subspace magic!? I thought it was something unusual, but I never imagined it would be this incredible.That wasn't the most pressing issue, however.Is this a C-Class skill?Chiffon, buffeted by Joshua's energy, could not believe his eyes. The mana he felt was vast and boundless; it had to be B-Class, at minimum.What a phenomenal rate of progress\u2026!\u00a0Chiffon was terrified at this point, but he couldn't hold back his sword now.\u00a0I have no idea how much you'll grow if you leave like this. I'd much rather you die here\u2014!Chiffon breathed every scrap of mana he had into his sword.The moment peaked with exquisite tension; it teetered and dallied on the edge of catastrophe.\"Tell me, what are you doing?\"The immense Imperial Palace contained a variety of palaces reserved solely for the princes. One, in particular, stood out: the furthest from the Imperial Palace.This one was definitely shabby, unlike the other elegantly adorned palaces.Curiously, its door was wide open today.In the fading light of the setting sun, a knock echoed quietly in the detached palace's largest chamber.The man seated by the window gently raised his head from his book at the sound. Or perhaps we should call him a boy rather than a man? A boy with brilliant eyes and bright blonde hair that would attract attention wherever he went: Kaiser von Britten, fourth prince of the Avalon Empire.\"This is Evergrant, Prince.\"\"Please, enter.\"The door gently swung open to admit Evergrant, Chief Wizard of the Empire, dressed in his trademark spotless white robe.\"A letter has arrived from Agnus.\"\"It appears he has made up his mind.\" Kaiser's eyes twinkled. He'd been looking forward to this letter arriving. \"Have you examined the contents?\"\"I thought it would be impolite, so I brought it here as soon as it arrived at the Imperial Palace.\"All mail sent to the Imperial family via the Imperial Palace's mana post was routed through Evergrant, the most senior mage.Kaiser smiled warmly at Evergrant for his consideration.\"Will he actually take me up on my offer?\"\"I believe he will accept.\" Evergrant responded without hesitation. \"All knights dream of joining the Knights Templar. You would be an idiot to refuse this chance.\"\"Let's see\u2026\" Recalling the boy with the remarkable blue hair brought a smile to Kaiser's face as he skimmed through the letter.Tak. The letter fell from his hand.\"Prince?\" Evergrant cautiously leaned towards him. His fears were confirmed when Kaiser didn't respond.\"Hahahahaha\u2026\" Kaiser chuckled.\"Prince?\" Kaiser's sudden outburst left Evergrant confused and embarrassed.\"Hahahahahahahaha!\" The discarded letter was crushed under Kaiser's heel. His modest smile stretched into a maddened rictus, and his kind eyes glittered with a psychotic light.\"...Joshua von Agnus.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No doubt it looked like he was bullying Joshua.Isn't this an inexcusable situation? I'm doomed.While Chiffon was flailing around for options, Vanessa quietly stepped forward.\"I called Lucia and the boy over. They claimed you were taking them to the capital, so I figured I'd have lunch with them before they go.\"The way Vanessa emphasized the word \"capital\" made Duke Agnus consider his next words carefully. He carefully looked around: the Duchess's eyes smoldered with anger; Lucia was anxious and restless; the food\u2026Vanessa's reaction was all the explanation he needed.\"How long are you going to stand around like that?\"\"Ah\u2026\" Chiffon hastily sheathed his sword. Likewise, Lugia disappeared with a shake of Joshua's hand.\"We are leaving tomorrow morning\u2026\" Duke Agnus eyed Joshua and Lucia. \"Just get up\u2026\"\"All right.\" Joshua stood from his seat without hesitation and approached Lucia. \"Mother\u2014\"\"Ah! Yes\u2026\" Lucia was gently escorted out of the dining room.A voice came from behind Duke Agnus as he was about to leave.\"Why are you doing this now?\" Aren't you even going to deny it? Why are you always keeping me in the dark?\"\"...Do you hold a grudge against me?\" Duke Agnus slowly turned to face Vanessa.\"I'm sorry.\" Vanessa's face crumpled.\"What is it that you are so upset about?\"\"It's\u2014\"\"\u2014Is it because I took interest in Joshua and Lucia all of a sudden?\"\"Don't bring up that bitch in front of me! Is this what you married me for!? You never cared about me, your pride and honor always came first.\"Duke Agnus remained stoic throughout her violent outburst.\"When you're born into the Imperial family, an arranged marriage is a given. I didn't marry you because of love, so I'm not going to get that. However\u2014!\" Vanessa bit her lip. \"I will not remain silent if that child harms Babel. Babel means everything to me, just as family and honor means everything to you. As one of the Empire's highest nobility, so long as you have basic manners you will be well looked after\u2014\"\"How about some 'basic manners'?\" Duke Agnus smirked. \"Would a person with 'basic manners' do such a thing?\"\"What\u2026?\"\"Did you think I wasn't aware?\" The Duke's steely gaze bored down on Vanessa and Chiffon.He knew everything.Lucia nagged Joshua for over an hour after they left the dining room.I'm sure you were upset.\u00a0Joshua smiled bitterly. He hadn't mentioned anything in advance, despite the tremendous changes going on. From Joshua's perspective, it wasn't a big deal\u2014he was just too busy to talk. But that was just an excuse.Shouldn't I have time to talk to my mom? We live in the same house.Humans constantly create excuses that are favorable to them, and those excuses are gathered and fastened to their parents' hearts.Joshua stopped berating himself when he noticed he had a guest waiting outside his door.\"Cain?\"Cain's footsteps echoed in the empty corridor as he approached Joshua.\"I was anticipating your arrival.\" The knight bowed before Joshua.\"Have you been waiting for a long time?\"\"Please.\" Cain chuckled and shook his head. \"I'm not that sluggish.\"\"Hmm\u2026 Is that so?\" Joshua cast Cain a doubtful look.\"Did you have a good meal?\" Cain sheepishly changed the subject.\"You knew?\"\"You weren't in your room, so I asked the butler.\"Was the butler in on the game?\u00a0Every part of this affair had to have been meticulously prepared. No doubt Vanessa had her fingers in every corner of the Duke's estate\u2014another reason for Joshua to move to the capital as soon as possible. He wasn't bothered by the insects swarming around him, but he wouldn't let them bother his mother.\"I heard you're leaving for the capital tomorrow.\"Joshua raised an eyebrow at him.\"It's just my opinion, but\u2026 I believe it's a fantastic choice. The Young Master can build up his power safely with the support of the capital, and you'll be able to learn something from the Grand Duke.\"Cain hesitated for a moment, then his expression firmed.\"I have a request, Young Master.\"\"What?\"\"What I mentioned before; my heart's desire. Will you accept me as your servant?\"Joshua's expression fell. Cain's question was troubling\u2014clearly, the more capable his followers all, the easier his life was. He was already planning on recruiting talent anyway. However, there was one thing he had to make sure of.\"Do you have any idea what path I'll take? You've come to the wrong spot if glory is what you want. People will reject the path I walk because it is paved with blood.\" Joshua stared Cain dead in the eyes. \"Do you still wish to follow me?\"\"A knight merely trusts and obeys his master.\" Cain slowly knelt before Joshua. \"No matter how much blood lies on their path. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I, as a knight, will stake my life on Young Master Joshua.\"Would you grant me this honor?\" Cain slammed his fist over his heart.Joshua broke his grim facade with a bright peal of laughter.\"Maybe.\"The next morning, the Duchy's staff were busy as bees. No one complained, even though they'd hosted a grand dinner the night before.Today was the day the Duke departed for the capital, after all.\"Attention!\" The Duke's knights were lined up in front of the castle's main gate as Duke Agnus made his appearance.\"Salute!\" As one, their swords were raised to the sky. Hundreds of knights moved in perfect unison, like clockwork.\"Are you sure you're okay?\"\"Everything is fine.\"\"You may be acting as a fallen noble, but your attendants are not limited. Don't you think it would be inconvenient to be accompanied by only one knight?\"\"Did you forget how I used to live?\" Joshua grinned and tossed a glance over his shoulder at Cain. \"One is excessive.\"\"All right. Well, then.\" Duke Agnus snapped his reins.\"For Agnus!\"Joshua spared the estate one last glance before he followed the Duke through the forest of gleaming blades.\"Wait!\" A thundering voice broke the solemn silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You seem to be feeling a little better now.\u201d\u201cAh. Thanks to the Duke, my recovery has come a long way. Please accept my apologies for burdening you.\u201d\u201cIs it just my mood, or has our tomboy princess suddenly transformed?\u201d Duke Agnus pulled a long face, much to Cox\u2019s vocal amusement.Not so long ago, Charles was a naive young lady who dashed about with no aim and no restraint. \u201cMister, Mister!\u201d was one of her signature phrases.\u201cYour father must be proud of you. What a shame, though\u2026 I miss the way you were, somehow\u2026\u201d\u201cAlrighty, Mister! Wanna just do it like we used to?\u201d\u201c\u2014Eh!?\u201d Cox yelped when Charles abruptly reverted.\u201cHaha! That\u2019s my Charles. If you\u2019re thinking of visiting the capital, would you care to join me? Did you know your father is also in Arcadia?\u201d\u201cThank you for your kindness, but I believe that would be impossible. Just promise to pay Cox\u2019s family a visit when you return.\u201d\u201cSuch a promise, Princess\u2026\u201d Cox looked troubled.\u201cI\u2019m not doing it for Cox, I\u2019m doing it for Anna, your beloved.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Cox sighed and clamped his mouth shut, bringing a cheeky smile to Charles\u2019s lips.\u201cAnd\u2026 Young Master Joshua?\u201dWhat the hell?\u00a0Joshua panicked when Charles called out to him. Somehow, her approach set him on edge. All the vassals and knights of the Duchy were watching\u2014it would be pretty irritating if they started spreading rumors.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to eat you.\u201d Charles smiled sweetly.\u201cHuh!\u201d The knights sputtered.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is the mark of our family.\u201d Charles grinned and held out her hand to Joshua.\u201cPri-Pri-Princess!?\u201d Cox was the first to recognize the object in her hand: a palm-sized, pure gold pendant engraved with a golden owl. The rest of the audience was equally wide-eyed, boggling at the unexpected appearance of the Pontier family crest.\u201cWhy did Princess Charles offer Young Master Joshua such a valuable gift\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs it possible that Young Master Joshua has a bond with Princess Charles?\u201d\u201cWhat a load of nonsense! Princess Charles already has Young Master Babel in her heart!\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter? A woman\u2019s heart should sway like a reed. They\u2019re not even dating, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cAh, says the guy who doesn\u2019t know how a woman\u2019s heart works.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dJoshua\u2019s mood sank. He wanted to showcase his abilities, not lubricate the rumor mill.\u201cWhat am I going to do with this?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m no snob. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, just\u2026\u201d Charles winked. \u201cI\u2019d like you to consider it an invitation. Please pay our family a visit if you travel to Arcadia.\u201d\u201cWhy should I\u2014\u201d Joshua hesitated because Charles looked like she was about to cry.\u201cWhat are you crying over, Princess Charles?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason the lady gave it to him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just an invitation, but Young Master Joshua is a formidable opponent.\u201dObviously, Joshua\u2019s superhuman senses heard everything.This is\u2026\u00a0The boy was greatly perplexed.\u00a0If this tomboy actually cries right now, the rumors will spread like wildfire. Everyone will be trying to figure out who I am. No good.Joshua grimaced. It would take him at least five years to restore his strength to a decent level; all his plans would be foiled, however, by Charles\u2019s shenanigans.I don\u2019t have to use it if I take it. After all, Arcadia is huge\u2014I won\u2019t see them unless I go looking for them.\u201c...Okay?\u201d Charles awkwardly extended the pendant towards Joshua again. \u201cAre you going to embarrass me like this? I\u2019m just trying to make amends for my prior indifference\u2014\u201d\u201cAh! Okay! I get it!\u201d Joshua grabbed the pendant. A teasing little smile flickered across Charles\u2019s lips, but Joshua was too preoccupied to notice.\u201cWe have a long way to go.\u201d Duke Agnus coughed politely but wore a mischievous little smile. \u201cWe\u2019d best leave soon. Charles, may I visit as well?\u201d\u201cOf course, uncle\u2014no, Duke! You are always welcome.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to prepare the Heart Kingdom De Bellue in advance!

I\u2019ll see you next time.\u201d\u201cDepart!\u201d The Duke spun around.\u201cDepart!\u201dDuke Agnus eyed Joshua\u2019s back as they departed.Perhaps you don\u2019t know what it implies for a lady to bestow their family crest to someone.The Duke\u2019s smile was as bright as the rising sun.Jaken, head of the Emperor\u2019s intelligence agency, prostrated himself before the Emperor\u2019s throne.\u201cYour Majesty, we have received new information regarding Duke Agnus, as you ordered.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d A glimmer of light shone in his dark eyes.\u201cDuke Aden von Agnus and his second son, Joshua von Agnus, are expected to arrive in the capital in three days. And\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThe Fourth Prince Kaiser\u2019s recommendation to the Imperial Knights Templar\u2026 was declined.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Marcus\u2019s eyes popped wide open. \u201cHe refused?\u201dThe power of the Imperial Knights could not be overestimated. No noble below a count could take on even a single member. It was no exaggeration to say they were the most powerful military force in the Empire, with the rise of the Imperial family\u2019s power.Suffice to say, Emperor Marcus believed he was the most powerful man on the entire continent. Joshua, apparently, disagreed. A second son\u2014a bastard, no less. In most families, he would live or die by the eldest son\u2019s grace.\u201c...Do you believe you can seize your family with just your own strength? I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem that way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d\u201cAccording to Joshua von Agnus\u2019s letter to Prince Kaiser, \u2018I don\u2019t need the Prince\u2019s approval.

It lives up to its glorious reputation.\u00a0The awe-inspiring Imperial Palace loomed over the lesser buildings, dominating the capital\u2019s skyline\u2014of course, Joshua had grown bored of it a long time ago.Arcadia\u2019s land prices were as incredible as its splendor; Duke Agnus, one of the highest-ranking aristocrats in the Empire, resided in one of Arcadia\u2019s most expensive areas. A single building in the heart of Arcadia would cost as much as a fort in a rural area.The building Joshua and his group stood before, on the other hand, was located on the city outskirts.\u201cThis location\u2026\u201d Cain muttered.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cRight. Arcadia is where I spent my childhood and where I came into the Duke\u2019s following.\u201dYou were close enough for him to bring you along?\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes twinkled.\u00a0But it was I who made use of your full potential.It was obvious to Joshua that Cain was concealing his abilities, even if his senses weren\u2019t even a tenth as sharp as they used to be. Curiously, though, that was all he knew about \u201cSir Cain\u201d. That could mean one of two things: either he failed to break his limits and faded into obscurity, or he was wiped out with the rest of the Agnus Duchy before he had a chance to fully blossom.Whichever it is, he\u2019s better off with me.\u00a0Joshua would make sure his people could walk with their heads held high. It was how a master should show his appreciation for his subordinates\u2019 devotion.\u201cI\u2019ve only been here once.\u201d Cain scratched his head. \u201cHe invited me here to put my abilities to the test. As you may have noticed, the Duke\u2019s residence has many eyes\u2014so, there\u2019s no better place to train quietly than here.\u201dWith that, Cain pushed open the door.\u201cOh?\u201d Lucia giggled in delight when she saw the interior opening before her. It was big and clean, in contrast to its outdated exterior; hidden away in the backyard, they could see a small but private training ground.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d It was exactly what Joshua wanted: a peaceful spot to train and meditate without being distracted by prying eyes.However, security is the worst because it\u2019s in such a thinly populated area.Except for Cain, everyone who came with them were maids to assist Lucia. That was exactly what Joshua wanted, but if he was attacked\u2026It would be difficult for Cain to defend my mother on his own, and I can\u2019t stay here all the time. Then\u2026The last school year had just ended, so the academy was on break; that meant there were still over two months until the start of the new semester. Plenty of time.\u201cCain.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be gone for a while.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about right now?\u201d Cain blinked at him.\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell my mother, even if she asks.\u201d\u201c... It\u2019s big here. You\u2019ll get lost if you wander around,\u201d Cain muttered blankly as he watched Joshua fade from view. \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll just amble around for a bit.\u201dJoshua took a slow walk to the center of the capital and had a look around. The experience was curiously fresh, despite his obvious familiarity with the place.Impressions later. I have more pressing matters at the moment.\u00a0Joshua strode away with purpose. Right now, he needed information\u2014Joshua was desperate to fill in the gaps in his memory.Joshua detoured from the entertainment street and winded through alleys away from the center.\u201cIt\u2019s just the same as it was decades ago.\u201d Joshua chuckled. He stood before a building dubbed \u201cA Glass of Wine in the White Rawolf\u201d on a sign that rattled and shook like it would fall off any minute. It was a bar, as the name suggested.Looks fine on the surface.\u201cKid, did ya go down the wrong road?\u201d A voice interrupted him just as he was reaching for the doorknob.Finally, the main character appeared.\u00a0Joshua had felt the man following him the minute he stepped into this alley.Joshua slowly turned around and smiled sweetly at him.I\u2019m in the right place.\u00a0The man\u2019s face confirmed that.An informant needed neither enormous strength nor a smart head; they needed discretion and deception. In that sense, the young man\u2019s unremarkable, entirely forgettable appearance made him an ideal specimen.\u201cI came to recover the red coin buried in the depths of the Raulf River.\u201dSurprise flickered across the man\u2019s expression, but his composure returned almost immediately.\u201cCome this way.\u201dJoshua grinned. The man would never ask questions, regardless of the customer\u2014not even if they traded a dragon\u2019s heart. Discreet transactions for reasonable rates.You might be intrigued by my childish physique, but you stick to your guidelines. That, I suppose, is how you stay the best in the business.The bar wasn\u2019t in its peak hours yet. The majority of the tables were empty, with a handful of people drinking by themselves. They weren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d guests, to be sure.\u201cTake care of the counter, Ryan.\u201dOne of the \u201cdrinkers\u201d then stood up and walked out the door as Joshua and the man passed by.You don\u2019t have to be concerned about security. I\u2019d be interested in a dragon\u2019s heart, but there\u2019s no incentive to reveal any information unless it\u2019s a large item.Above all else, \u201ctrust\u201d is the lifeblood of this industry. After all, who would trade information if it was leaked all over the continent? Any breach of security would spell the doom of the company.The young man turned the corner and groped at a dimly-lit corner. With a small click, a hidden underground passage was revealed.\u201cBe careful; it\u2019s dark.\u201dA bright red door guarded by two men lied at the end of the passage.\u201cIt\u2019s a client.\u201dThe guards opened the door without a word.Is he higher up than I assumed?\u00a0Joshua eyed the young man curiously. To get that kind of reaction from the guards, even in a secret corridor\u2026 This man couldn\u2019t be judged by his appearance.Past the door was smaller than Joshua had imagined. The waiting room was about the same size as the room upstairs, with many smaller rooms lining the sides. There were six rooms, labeled \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201c4\u201d, and \u201c5\u201d, with the last one hidden behind a dark curtain. Joshua\u2019s guide led him into the third room and gestured to a front-row seat.\u201cPlease, sit.\u201dJoshua sat placidly in his chair and looked around the room. It was modest, just like the waiting room: one table in the middle and a fist-sized hold in the back wall, where the young man sat.Perhaps the data is delivered through that hole?\u201cAll right, what information do you require?\u201d\u201cAre you also an informant? You sell, too?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct; is that an issue?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just amusing that someone like the branch manager escorts me merely for level 3 information\u2026\u201d Joshua chuckled and shook his head. \u201cIs there a personnel shortage, perhaps?\u201dThe young man\u2019s eyes flinched.\u201c...You seem familiar with our company\u2014but how did you know that I\u2019m the branch manager?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 but it was obvious from your reaction just now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSimple,\u201d Joshua smirked. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask \u2018how did you know that I\u2019m the branch manager?\u2019 if you weren\u2019t the branch manager.\u201dJoshua raised a finger.\u201cThe informants\u2019 identities are kept hidden to maintain operational security\u2014even informants from the same branch have no idea who each other are. It\u2019s the best structure I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201cOne of the organization\u2019s distinguishing features is that each branch has a manager who controls and monitors every aspect of its operations. Some informants aren\u2019t even aware they exist, much less their name.\u201cI just made an educated guess based on people\u2019s reactions to you.\u201dJoshua settled into his chair with a confident expression.\u201cI thought the stories were overblown, but now I believe they were more fact than rumor.\u201d The mysterious young man looked Joshua dead in the eye. \u201cYoung Master Joshua, second son of Agnus.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49\u201cYou seem familiar with who I am,\u201d said Joshua, unconcerned.\u201cYou\u2019re the most talked-about person in the Empire. If I didn\u2019t know that much, I\u2019d be out of a job.\u201dThat was both good and bad in equal measure. A lot of planning had gone into keeping his arrival secret: his small company was divided into smaller groups before they arrived at Arcadia, and Joshua was prepared to act as a member of Viscount Frederick\u2019s family if anyone asked. Yet, despite his best efforts, this man already knew his identity.From a client\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a warm welcome. It implies that they\u2019re credible. But, on the other hand, that information could be sold at any time.It\u2019s almost certain that someone else knows my whereabouts.Joshua shook his head. He didn\u2019t want this to happen, but it was inevitable\u2014he just couldn\u2019t control all the information on his own.\u201cI think I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d A comfortable smile danced on the man\u2019s normally harsh features. \u201cLet me tell you one thing\u2026 At this point, the only people who know your true identity are me and a few of my subordinates. Incidentally, no one has yet to approach us for information about the Young Master.\u201d\u201cCan you just tell me that? It seems like valuable information.\u201d Joshua laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t even pay right now because I\u2019m a powerless punk.\u201d\u201cYou came without money?\u201d\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a real pity\u2026\u201d The man scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the guy in front of me is really a nine-year-old kid. It feels like you\u2019re an old man who\u2019s seen it all, yet\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d said Joshua.\u201cWell, as I said before, I won\u2019t take any money\u2014it\u2019s a token of appreciation for our first meeting.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d\u201c...I had no intention of even presenting myself, at first\u2014but I suppose I should, for the Young Master.\u201d The man stood up from his seat. \u201cMy name is Jero, branch manager of the Moon Gate in Arcadia. It is an honor to meet the future of the Empire.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to admit you\u2019re the branch manager just like that?\u201d\u201cThe branch managers are an open secret.\u201d Jero shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not publicly available information, but it\u2019s not that much of a secret.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 keeping it a secret hasn\u2019t helped me obtain information, so it doesn\u2019t seem like a business loss from my point of view.\u201dJero sat back down and rubbed his chin.\u201cThat was a long introduction. So, let\u2019s get down to business\u2014May I inquire as to why you approached our organization in this manner?\u201d\u201cBefore we discuss my objective, I\u2019d like to ask you a question. Would it be fair to say that this room means you\u2019re only allowed to pass information up to level 3?\u201d\u201cThat was correct at the time, however\u2026\u201d Jero looked deeply into Joshua\u2019s eyes. \u201cI will supply you with the highest level of information permissible, up to level 1 information.\u201d\u201c..Why are you giving me so much information on my first time?\u201d\u201cThe same as previously.\u201d Jero shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a long term investment. It would be a shame to let you walk away when your genius will soon leave its mark on the Empire\u2014or even the continent at large.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes narrowed as he listened to Jero. It might be a gamble, but there were no such things as unpaid favors. If he supplied first-rate information, his demands would be monumental to match. All information handled by the Moon Gate was renowned both for its exceptional quality and its outlandish price.But that doesn\u2019t imply I need to reveal my weaknesses right away.\u201cWith a pseudonym like \u2018Jero\u2019, I would have thought I could obtain at least Earth-level information. It seems like that\u2019s not the case, however.\u201d\u201c... You\u2019ve impressed me once again.\u201d Jero\u2019s face stiffened. \u201cHow in the world did you know that?\u201d He was starting to think one of his personnel was a mole. Otherwise, an outsider wouldn\u2019t know so much about the organization\u2019s internal affairs.\u201cYou supply the customers information, no questions asked\u2014wasn\u2019t that the Moon Gate\u2019s iron rule?\u201dJero grimaced and bowed his head.\u201c...I apologize for my mistake. Tell me what information you need.\u201dJoshua chuckled.\u201cI\u2019m looking for something.\u201d\u201cAn object? What might\u2014?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an heirloom from the family of Count Orbis, who were wiped out ten years ago. I want to know who owns the item now.\u201d\u201cThe Orbis family\u2026\u201d Jero worked his jaw while he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult. Most of the Orbis family\u2019s property landed in the black market. If we focus there\u2026\u201dJoshua knew it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as it appeared. The confidentiality and security of the black market are its primary appeal, such that the public is completely unaware it exists at all. Jero could only be so nonchalant because he worked for the Moon Gate.\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll take a long time?\u201d\u201cA week is plenty.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Joshua\u2019s grin widened.\u201cDo you require any other information?\u201dJoshua hesitated; his next inquiry was extremely sensitive\u2014sensitive enough to provoke a reaction from Duke Agnus.The Moon Gate appears to be a multinational intelligence agency with no national roots on the surface. I\u2019m not saying anything right now, but\u2026\u00a0Joshua squeezed his eyes shut and grumbled to himself.\u00a0\u2026 there\u2019s no such thing as a well-kept secret.If what I know reaches someone\u2019s ears, it could cause a lot of problems.\u00a0Joshua unconsciously drummed his fingers against the table.\u00a0It would be good to start by just observing to not draw suspicion. I\u2019ll just say I know nothing if anyone presses me.If his plan worked, he could get two birds with one stone.\u201cMay the moon bless whoever discovers the red coin buried in the Raulf River\u2014\u201d\u201cHey, what\u2014How did you know?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t ask customers for personal information\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is completely different! Only a few people in our company know that myth! What is your real identity!?\u201d\u201cWhoever seeks the Moon Gate will find it, am I right? Well, not for an outsider like me. But it is what you\u2019re looking for right now?Joshua raised three fingers.\u201cThree years. Three years, and I\u2019ll find it. There are, of course, conditions.\u201d\u201c...Are you certain?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say I was a long-term investment?\u201d Joshua smiled. \u201cBelieve me or not, I will find it.\u201dJero pondered for a brief moment before slowly opening his mouth.\u201c...To be honest, the successor\u2019s competition finished a year ago. It\u2019s an item that no longer needs finding.\u201dI thought the succession battle would be drawing to a close around this time, but I didn\u2019t expect it to already be over.\u00a0Maybe it was only natural\u2014the new leader of the Moon Gate possesses such incredible talents, after all.\u201c...But. That mark is a symbolic object that our organization has sought for decades. Perhaps \u2018he\u2019 is eager to find it too.\u201d Jero\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cLet\u2019s start with your conditions, then we can judge the value of the investment.\u201d\u201cGreat. My conditions are simple: from now on, you will never disclose the information I\u2019m about to ask for to anyone. That\u2019s my condition.\u201d\u201cOur organization never sells customer information\u2014\u201d Jero clapped his mouth shut when Joshua shot him a baleful stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m telling the truth?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you doing this as an investment? I\u2019d like to make an investment as well.\u201d\u201c... I\u2019ve worked for the organization for decades, but I\u2019ve never met anyone like the Young Master.\u201d Jero shook his head helplessly. \u201cSo, what is your request?\u201d\u201cDraxia Bell Grace.\u201d\u201cDraxia Bell Grace\u2014!\u201d Jero leapt up from his seat, staring at Joshua with wide, terrified eyes. \u201cDraxia Bell Grace, the War God!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Lucia was loath to part from her child\u2014the new environment let her spend time with her son without other people disturbing them. There was a fight, but Lucia ended up raising the white flag; it seems no parent can win against their child. The most likely threat to Lucia while Joshua was in the academy was from the inside, not the outside.With only a week until he would enter the academy, Joshua was getting nervous.\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you.\u201dThe Imperial Palace Restaurant sits deep within Arcadia, with a large sign boasting, \u201cExperience the cooking of the Imperial Palace\u2019s chef!\u201dJoshua, sipping a glass of milk at a corner table, shot a glance to the side. There sat Jero of the Moon Gate.\u201cYou\u2026 Are you Sir Cain?\u201dCain flinched\u2014he\u2019d been on high alert since Jero appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d Cain went back to eating without another word.\u201cThe fact that you approached me like this\u2014\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Jero interrupted with a beaming smile, \u201cI executed your order flawlessly.\u201d Jero pulled something from his sleeves and passed it furtively under the table, where Cain snatched it out of his hand.\u201cThe tracking took longer than expected due to the number of people involved. However\u2026 the last location has been found.\u201d\u201cHow much does it cost?\u201d\u201cAh, consider it on the house.\u201dJoshua was taken aback.\u201cThis is a little thing in comparison to other requests.\u201d Jero smiled. \u201cYou advise us to go, but these seem to be completely mundane things\u2026 I\u2019m wondering if they have some secret power we\u2019re not aware of.\u201d\u201cStop thinking about it.\u201dJoshua and Jero stared each other down for a moment.\u201c...Was that too far from the realm of possibility?\u201d Jero got up from his seat. \u201cNow then, since the rest of the commission remains uncompleted, I\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cAh, we\u2019ll take care of the request fee then.\u201d Jero clapped his hands together. \u201cThis is also complimentary; our organization takes an advanced payment for every request.\u201d\u201cComplimentary\u2026\u201d Joshua puffed up with laughter.There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. There will be a time, when the fruit is ripe, that he\u2019ll ask for something bigger.\u201cI\u2019ll be going now\u2026 I\u2019ll be in touch now and then.\u201d Jero bowed deeply and disappeared out the door.Joshua swept his gaze over the inside of the restaurant. It was late afternoon, well past lunchtime, so the restaurant was quite quiet.\u201cAre there a lot of aristocrats on the second floor at this time of day?\u201d\u201cPerhaps. Of course, because it\u2019s regularly used by the nobility, there will be additional fees\u2014\u201dJoshua was making for the stairs before Cain could finish his sentence. Cain followed him with a bemused expression, and the figures of a man and a boy vanished into the second floor.\u201cOh, Young Master Villas!\u201d A bloated man ran into the yard with no shoes on.This plump man\u2019s estate lied on the outskirts of town, across from the home Duke Agnus gave Joshua. As a baron, the lowest of the aristocrats, his home was far from the Imperial Palace. However, his mansion was far larger than a typical nobleman of his rank\u2014even on Arcadia\u2019s outskirts, that meant having money to burn. This was the residence of Baron Provalum, a well-regarded man throughout the entire Empire.\u201cYoung Master, what brings you to this filthy place without warning?\u201d Baron Provalum wiped his sweaty palms as he approached the young man who had just arrived.He had pristine white skin and emerald hair. He seemed unprofessional, but his eyes were dark and steely.\u201cProvalum, I believe the deadline has already passed.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d Baron Provalum shook his head remorsefully. \u201cAs you are aware, Young Master, female elves of any race are quite scarce. It\u2019s quite difficult for us to acquire such products. If you give me a little more time, I\u2019ll be able to\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your excuses. I believe I entrusted you to carry the task to fruition.\u201d\u201cI apologize profusely, Young Master.\u201d\u201cDoes a week suffice?\u201d\u201cOf course, of course! Can someone bring me some water?\u201dThe young man scowled at the sweaty baron and abruptly turned away. The clatter of armor echoed around Baron Provalum\u2019s lowered head as the young man\u2019s retinue disappeared from sight.\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I want to live up to my name.\u201d Baron Provalum flopped over where he stood. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way every time\u2026\u201d\u201cBaron, the water is here.\u201d The butler handed Baron Provalum a glass of water, which he downed instantly.\u201cI\u2026 Baron, is a week really enough? For an elf, a week\u2014\u201d\u201cI want to make it possible, even if it\u2019s impossible.\u201dBaron Provalum shivered. That young man is the reason why he, a bottom-rung aristocrat, could enjoy such wealth.I could have lost everything at a single word or doubled my wealth.\u201cThe Villas\u2026\u201d Baron Provalum whimpered.The Emperor\u2019s confidant, the Marquis of Villas. Veron Shen Villas, the only son of Marquis Shen Villas, a powerful pro-Imperial general, had made his appearance.Count Orbis\u2019s family was one of the few families of noble wizards in the Avalon Empire, an oddity in a land where magic was scorned. They\u2019d formed a pair with Count Rebrecca\u2019s family. Despite Avalon\u2019s knight-centric culture, Orbis had defied the stereotype that a wizard could not defeat a knight in single combat. The head of Orbis had famously cemented his place as the first battle wizard on the continent.The incident didn\u2019t gain much traction in Avalon, the kingdom of knights, but in Terra, the magic kingdom, the response was explosive. The monarch of Terra even went out of his way to invite the patriarch of Orbis to his kingdom.Such was the Orbis family, a family whose passion for magic was unmatched. A passionate advocate for the rights and interests of wizards; a family that may have altered the Empire\u2019s perception of wizards. But only a few years ago, the prosperous Orbis family had fallen completely.Not to just anyone\u2014they fell to the Imperial family.When you look at the records, you can\u2019t help but wonder if the Imperial family is eliminating nobles on purpose.Joshua eyed the parchment Jero had delivered. It bore a single line of writing.\u201cBaron Accent\u2026\u201d Joshua scowled.According to Moon Gate\u2019s report, the Orbis heirloom Joshua sought was most likely owned by Barron Accent. Unfortunately, Baron Accent was quite well-known in the area.Not famous, but notorious.\u00a0Joshua smiled wickedly.His initial plan was to buy the item with cash as soon as he could find it. Joshua hoped to capitalize on the fact that he was the only person who knew the object\u2019s true value. Despite being the heirloom of a prominent family of wizards, it was neither an artifact of unique power nor encrusted with gemstones. In the eyes of most people, it was nothing more and nothing less than a lovely golden ring.It\u2019s impossible for its true value to be exposed immediately\u2014but that\u2019s the issue. I can\u2019t just go out and buy it when I don\u2019t know anything about Baron Accent\u2019s character.\u201c...Colossus of the Night, Accent Provalum,\u201d Cain mumbled.\u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d\u201cJust a smidgen. He\u2019s reasonably well-known. Slave trading, smuggling, drug dealing\u2014he uses the influence of high-ranking aristocrats to engage in all sorts of nefarious activities. He\u2019s also the younger brother of Viscount Vig.\u201d\u201cHis brother?\u201d Joshua frowned.\u201cYes,\u201d Cain nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known within the Duke\u2019s family. Not to mention he\u2019s such a powerful character behind the scenes; everything in the black market passes through Baron Provalum\u2019s hands.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Joshua sighed.\u201cYoung Master Joshua?\u201dAn unexpected voice drew their attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would a pony eat the carrot if he\u2019s already full?\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Provalum.

So, what does a fat pony like this need?\u201d\u201cThe stick.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Veron nodded. \u201cWhen dealing with his underlings, the king should prioritize the whip; it turns hungry animals, venomous bastards, and fat pigs into tamed dogs instantly, like magic.\u201d Veron flashed a toothy grin. \u201cI\u2019m going to crush him. And then, when he\u2019s most afraid, I\u2019ll offer him my hand, and he\u2019ll never think about disobeying again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant\u2026\u201d Muker was in awe of the way his master deftly manipulated his minions.\u00a0And only fourteen years old, at that!\u00a0Muker couldn\u2019t even imagine how much Veron would grow in the future, given how far he\u2019d come in his short life so far.\u201cMore importantly, I thought he\u2019d find out today given his abilities.\u201d Veron chewed his lip like he really felt sorry for Provalum.\u201cI\u2019ll inform a receptionist to be prepared to serve you.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Today I want to eat out. That commoner\u2019s service was remarkable last time.\u201d Veron paused and gestured towards a nearby restaurant. \u201cI\u2019ve been out for a while; I\u2019m tired and starving\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it while I eat.\u201d\u201cVery good, Young Master.\u201dVeron\u2019s entourage moved towards a restaurant with the bold slogan, \u201cExperience the cooking of the Imperial Palace\u2019s chef!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Joshua?\u201dJoshua and Cain\u2019s heads snapped up at the same time at the startling sound of a woman\u2019s voice.\u201cWhat is it, Miss Iceline?\u201dIceline Jean Rebrecca, a girl with blue, flowing hair and a cold expression.In a place like this, I knew we had a high chance of running into the Rebreccas,\u00a0Cain thought.\u00a0They left the Duchy early because they said they had an urgent matter to attend to.\u201cSo\u2014\u201d Cain jumped out of his seat and looked around.\u00a0No way.\u00a0He discovered a young man eating in an inconspicuous corner with only a handful of escorts. In front of him was a man with huge, sad eyes and an unmistakable resemblance to Iceline. The Rebrecca family head was gesturing in Joshua\u2019s direction with a smile.\u201cCount Rebrecca,\u201d Cain walked up to the Count and bowed, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you.\u201d\u201cI was hoping to have a peaceful meal\u2014I hope I\u2019m not bothering Sir Cain and Young Master Joshua.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d Cain waved it off.In Cain\u2019s opinion, Poncel Jean Rebrecca didn\u2019t act like a noble\u2014but not in a negative way. He was born with a weak body but a humble personality. Even when he was hurt, he never said anything negative about others. He always spoke up for people, even commoners. Nobles, even a high-ranking one such as a count, would be despised and ridiculed by the other nobility if they dared to speak with a commoner. Count Rebrecca, however, could not be swayed: he remained ever kind and humble. Unknown to most nobles, Count Poncel Jean Rebrecca was greatly respected by the commoners.Cain couldn\u2019t wrap his head around the way the Count greeted them, but the Rebrecca knights didn\u2019t seem to think anything of it.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you, Young Master,\u201d Iceline said to Joshua as she straightened from her curtsey.\u201cIndeed, Lady Iceline.\u201d\u201cI thought it might be you. Young Master Joshua\u2019s hair would be unusual anywhere on the continent\u2026\u201d Iceline fluttered her fingers as if grasping for words. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat is this? Why are there so many people hanging around at this time of day?\u201d A group of people came up the stairs just as Iceline was about to speak.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this so you can relax,\u201d one of the newly-appeared knights said.\u201cWait a moment\u2026\u201d Veron Shen Villas\u2019s eyes lit up.\u00a0Did Arcadia always have a beauty like that?\u00a0Veron licked his lips as he groped Iceline with his rude gaze.Her porcelain white skins, her aura of purity that conjures a man\u2019s beastly instinct\u2026 Veron could already feel his lower half stiffening.How would she act when she\u2019s pinned underneath me?\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve met such a lovely woman in Arcadia,\u201d Veron said, managing to suppress his desire beneath a pleasant smile. \u201cMay I inquire as to which family you come from?\u201dIceline remained frostily silent; this boy\u2019s hungry gaze made her skin crawl like she was being drowned in maggots.\u201cThis is Veron Shen Villas.\u201d Muker stepped forward when he saw Iceline\u2019s stiff reaction. \u201cMarquis Villas\u2019s eldest son.\u201d\u201cThe Marquis of Villas!\u201d Cain groaned under his breath.Even in a place as dense with aristocrats as Arcadia, Marquis Villas stood firmly at the top of the food chain. No one could compete with the twelve marquis\u2014known as the \u201ctwelve families\u201d\u2014except for the five mighty dukes. Furthermore, as one of the Emperor\u2019s trust confidants, Villas\u2019s military power was considerable even amongst the twelve families.And Veron Shen Villas was his only son\u2026\u201cFrom my memory\u2014which, by the way, is excellent\u2014I don\u2019t recall you being a member of the Imperial family, nor a duke\u2026 because, you see, we only have five of them.\u201dIceline was startled and stepped back.\u201cSo, if you\u2019re a lower rank than me or even a noble without a title, how dare you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you showing the Young Master the respect he deserves?\u201d Muker\u2019s hand dropped to the hilt of his blade threateningly.Cain was about to step forwards, but someone beat him there.\u201cPlease accept my apologies for my daughter\u2019s coldness, Veron\u2026 It is, however, a privilege to encounter the kin of the renowned Marquis of Villas.\u201d\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Veron tilted his head at Poncel.\u201cI am Poncel Jean Rebrecca, the patriarch of the Rebrecca family.\u201dContempt flickered through Veron\u2019s eyes as he gazed at Poncel\u2019s lowered head.\u201cI\u2019m not asking\u00a0you\u00a0to apologize, Count Poncel Jean Rebrecca.\u201d Veron turned his head to Iceline. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, aren\u2019t I? Now, I can\u2019t stand the insult.\u201dVeron was being blatantly provocative. Naturally, nobles would be offended if lower-ranking nobles didn\u2019t pay their respects\u2026 but that was for public occasions. Who would be prepared to show their respect in such an informal environment? Obviously, Veron intended to embarrass Iceline.\u201cYou should apologize.\u201dHe was utterly trampling on the Rebrecca family\u2019s dignity.What a burden\u2026 Isn\u2019t he just a jerk who uses his family name to stir up trouble? This is only because he knows he can get away with it. Tsk.The son\u2014not even the Marquis himself\u2014was ignoring the head of a noble family.Ah, this, really\u2026\u00a0Veron licked his lips lasciviously, oblivious to the burning stares of the people around him.\u00a0I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand your fault.\u201d Veron stepped closer to Iceline.\u201cOh, t-that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cThis insult will haunt me for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is not even remotely amusing.\u201d\u201c\u2014What?\u201d Veron\u2019s head snapped around towards the unexpected interruption.\u201cMarquis Villas must be anxious because his one and only heir is a fucked up bastard.\u201d\u201cYou! What did that brat just say?!\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Muker drew his blade and grinned viciously. \u201cWith a wagging tongue like that, you must have a death wish! Make yourself known!\u201d\u201cDid you just draw your sword?\u201dMuker flinched. \u201c\u2014What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIf you live and die by the blade, I assume you understand the significance of your actions.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense\u2014\u201d\u201cYou have to be held accountable for your actions.\u201dWhat is this energy?!\u00a0Muker\u2019s eyes spun as the air seemed to strain, making his entire body tense.The epicenter of this storm was, of course\u2026What is this energy oozing from that little boy?Joshua\u2019s energy was narrowly focused on Muker, because everyone around them remained oblivious of his terrible presence. He took a slow step forward, and Muker swallowed nervously.\u201cYou asked who I am?\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes bore down on Muker. \u201cMy name is\u2026 Ash den Frederick.\u201d\u201cAsh\u2026 den Frederick?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about it that hard. I\u2019ll sear it into your mind right now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Immediately, over a dozen people were blocking access to Veron. Count Rebrecca\u2019s knights were reaching for their swords, too, when Joshua raised his hand.\u201cDo not step forward.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Young Master?\u201d\u201cThis situation is my problem\u2026 I don\u2019t believe the Rebrecca Knights should become involved in this.\u201d\u201cWhat do\u2014?\u201d\u00a0Doesn\u2019t this concern Young Lady Iceline\u2019s safety? Even if Young Master Joshua is handling it right now, this still concerns Rebrecca.\u00a0The knight\u2019s shame was palpable.But Villas\u2019s knights, who had no idea who Joshua was, were absolutely perplexed by the situation.How could the descendent of some family he\u2019d never heard of act so boldly towards a Marquis\u2019s son, Varon wondered.Isn\u2019t that borderline suicidal? I certainly wouldn\u2019t object to a swordfight breaking out.\u201cThe Frederick family\u2026 I\u2019m not familiar with the name. What is your rank?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, really.\u201d Veron burst out laughing. \u201cAfter all, your family will disappear from history real soon.\u201d The boy sneered. \u201cYour sin was not understanding the difference between my heaven and your earth. Interfering in my business must mean you have a death wish\u2014I won\u2019t just wipe out your family, I\u2019ll kill your dogs and every plant growing on your estate. Then you\u2019ll understand how foolish you were for provoking Veron Villas.\u201cThat\u2019s how powerful I am.\u201d Veron\u2019s mouth stretched into a savage grin. \u201cGet down on your knees, Ash, and I might be merciful to only cut off one limb.\u201dHe didn\u2019t show it, but Veron was pretty pleased with the current situation. He was used to getting what he wanted: all he had to do was threaten everyone involved and they\u2019d apologize, beg for their lives, and fork over the goods. However, despite his prodigal habits, he knew a Marquis\u2019s son didn\u2019t have the clout to challenge a high-ranking noble like a Count.Well, it\u2019s not that I fear the Rebreccas; it\u2019s just that it would be a nuisance if the rumors reached my father\u2019s ears.As such, Veron was quite happy to assuage his pride by trampling the boy in front of him.He\u2019s perfect.\u00a0By all appearances, Joshua was the spawn of some low-ranking noble hick. Veron\u2019s snake-like eyes glittered, and he licked his lips.\u201cThis is nauseating.\u201d\u201c\u2014What?\u201d Veron was jolted out of his fantasies. \u201cWhat are you up to now\u2014\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s horrid. The smell of trash makes my stomach churn.\u201dThe rest of the group was blown away by Joshua\u2019s offensive comment.\u201cThis kid!\u201d Muker shouted. \u201cHow desperate are you to die?! You don\u2019t even know how respect works!\u201d\u201cRespect? For that\u00a0thing?\u201d Joshua howled with laughter. \u201cIs that the same \u2018respect\u2019 you use when you get a gang of knights together to persecute a woman?\u201d\u201cMuker!\u201d Veron decided that fun-time was over.\u201cYes, my lord!\u201d\u201cHow much longer do I have to put up with these insults?\u201d\u201cGive me the order! I\u2019ll take care of it immediately!\u201d\u201cImmobilize that insect\u2014I\u2019m going to kill him myself.\u201d\u201cI apologize: it seems you need to die.\u201d Muker hefted his sword. \u201cYou were the one who threw away your last chance\u2026 You have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d\u201cHah! \u2018Blame\u2019, you say?\u201d Joshua sneered. \u201cThere\u2019s no such word in my vocabulary.\u201dJoshua stepped forward to meet Muker\u2019s advance.Three people sat in the private office of Viscount Steck in Locke Castle: the owner, Viscount Vig Beck Steck, an unidentifiable, gray-masked individual, and a girl. Viscount Vig\u2019s empty eyes stared into nothingness while the other two spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Miss Anna.\u201d The masked one bowed to the girl.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Ju-ang. I see you\u2019ve arrived earlier than expected.\u201d\u201cI came in a rush when you summoned me.\u201dAnna just smiled.\u201cFigures\u2026 So, what did you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a problem,\u201d Anna said.\u201cYou think it\u2019s a problem?\u201dThe girl nodded. \u201cMaybe I should call it a nuisance rather than a problem?\u201dShe seems to be in a good mood\u2026\u00a0Ju-ang\u2019s eyes flickered with curiosity as Anna\u2019s speech became excited.\u201cMay I ask what this problem is?\u201d\u201cA monster has appeared in the Agnus duchy.\u201d\u201cAre you referring to Babel von Agnus?\u201d\u201cI see the rumors haven\u2019t spread too far yet, after all,\u201d Anna said with a shake of her head. \u201cAnother child of Duke Agnus has appeared\u2026 and, horribly, he\u2019s a scumbag who outstrips Babel von Agnus\u2019s abilities.\u201dJu-ang was astonished; Babel was one of the most talented people on the continent, never mind the Empire\u2014how could some kid possibly compare to a genius like Babel?\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t report this sooner?!\u201d Ju-ang leaped out of their seat. \u201cYou could have used a communication tool\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a chance the information could leak.\u201d Anna giggled when she saw Ju-ang clamp their mouth shut. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you, Ju-ang, so don\u2019t overwork yourself. This information will spread all over the continent anyways.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\u201cHe could wield mana before ten years old. That kind of talent is the greatest of all time, in the continent and beyond. Do you think Avalon will stand still with such a treasure in\u00a0his\u00a0hands?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cDuke Agnus will spread the stories throughout the Empire to elevate his family\u2019s reputation. In times of peace, like now, whispers like this can whip up a storm.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d Ju-ang nodded.On the surface, it appeared they were living in an unprecedented period of peace\u2014but the continent was closer to a primed powder keg.The continent had been engaged in a quiet buildup of power. The simple folks might rejoice because their country had become stronger, but those in the halls of power whispered of \u201crebellion\u201d and \u201ccivil war\u201d.However, there was always a solution:War.\u201cIn battle, the power of a \u2018master\u2019 is absolute,\u201d Anna whispered. \u201cNo country would fight a war if they didn\u2019t have a chance to win. So, they always need to know what the other countries are up to; the number of intelligence organizations has been steadily increasing.\u201d\u201cThe right information could be a game-changer when the other countries decide to defend or attack.\u201d Ju-ang\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201c...I understand now, Miss Anna. But regarding the other son of Duke Agnus: his appearance is bad news for us. If you make a mistake, decades of your planning could go to waste in an instant.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d Anna smiled bitterly.\u201cAre you thinking of\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. What if we could subdue that monster?\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Because he\u2026\u201d\u00a0Once upon a time, he, too, was abandoned\u2026Anna swallowed the words and waved her hand. \u201cAnyways, Ju-ang, I\u2019ve come up with an idea. I\u2019ll travel up to Arcadia to enroll in the academy.\u201d\u201cThe academy\u2026 Then, Duke Agnus will\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, for the time being. Believe in me: I will bring him here, upon the name of Anna Bell Grace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can go ahead and fuck off.\u201d\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Veron couldn\u2019t believe his eyes: the elite Knights of Villas were scattered across the floor, moaning in pain.They were all defeated?\u00a0Funnily enough, everything was done by one boy, whose underdeveloped body was half the size of an adult knight\u2019s.\u201cKeugh!\u201d Muker was the first to collapse. The bloody phlegm coming out of his mouth made it clear that he had severe internal injuries. Clearly, even a certified B-Class Knight was no match for the Young Master.Veron and Muker gaped at Joshua, trembling with shock and fear.\u00a0How is it possible for a child to defeat a man-wielding knight with his bare fists?\u00a0One hit straight to Muker\u2019s lower abdomen had put him on his back. Joshua didn\u2019t even draw a weapon\u2014although that assumed he had one, to begin with. He just looked like a cute kid running at Muker with his little hands.A knight stepped in front of Muker to try to protect him from Joshua\u2019s advance. The knight was decked out across the floor by Joshua\u2019s punch in no time at all.Damn it.\u00a0Muker cursed Joshua. He\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t afraid of the boy. Death was too good for the brat; Muker decided he\u2019d cut up Joshua all day long.\u201cHeup!\u201d Muker dashed towards Joshua, enveloping his sword in mana as he ran. The clear, flowing mana of a B-Class Knight was an awe-inspiring sight to behold.Joshua chuckled and casually punched at Muker.The result?Well, it\u2019s safe to say it worked out just fine for Joshua.Muker\u2019s sword stopped neatly against Joshua\u2019s hand, sending Muker staggering back. No ordinary person would have been able to predict the blade\u2019s trajectory even if they somehow knew the exact distance between them. It was perfect\u2014perhaps even godlike.Muker, however, was more concerned with Joshua\u2019s other fist, which was headed straight for his stomach.\u201cUgh.\u201d Muker bent 90 degrees and dropped to the floor. The brutal impact rattled his body and left him reeling as he desperately fought to drag his battered frame back into action.I have no choice but to accept it now.\u00a0Muker was dead certain he couldn\u2019t deal with Joshua.Muker groaned as he forced his jaw open. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\u201cIt matters to me.\u201d Muker put up a strong front, but his heart was ready to burst with surprise. It wasn\u2019t fair\u2014how could he, a B-Class Knight, be beaten down with a single punch?But he\u2019d felt it rippling through his body as those tiny fists slammed into his stomach, that razor-sharp energy.Mana.\u00a0Only a \u2018master\u2019\u2014an A-Class Knight at a minimum\u2014could infuse mana into his bare fist. Muker couldn\u2019t believe such a child could have obtained that level of perfection, but\u2026It was unlikely that the boy was known to the rest of the world. His existence was probably a long-kept family secret\u2014and that family could not possibly be ordinary.\u201cTell me, Young Master,\u201d Muker said, managing to straighten his back, \u201cwhat\u2019s your real identity?\u201d\u201cDo you think knowing will help you feel more at ease?\u201d Joshua laughed at him.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for losing. Don\u2019t chase others\u2019 strength; instead, acknowledge your own flaws. Then you can seek loftier heights.\u201dMuker was stunned. The boy was right: Muker lost to himself more than he lost to Joshua. It made him understand that sometimes losing is actually winning. When you win, your shortcomings are hidden by the bright light of victory; when you lose, you can find the enlightenment to move forward.\u00a0Should I have been more aggressive, or,\u00a0If I\u2019d understood my opponent\u2019s abilities better.What mattered was that he couldn\u2019t just make up excuses. Was he going to give up and sulk, or, on the other hand, would he use his defeat as a springboard to take the next step?\u201cMuker! What are you doing?!\u201d Veron screamed at Muker when the knight stiffened like he\u2019d been struck like lightning. He knew he was on the edge of losing his fortune if his knight couldn\u2019t shape up.Veron whirled to face Joshua. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\u201cWere you not listening? I already introduced myself: Ash pen Frederick!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d Veron shouted back. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of the Frederick family! Do you have any idea how serious of a crime it is to pretend to be a noble?\u201dJoshua paused. It seemed like Veron resorted to terrible jokes when he was backed into a corner.\u201cYou have no idea who I am, you idiot! I am Veron Shen Villas! The sole heir of the Marquis of Villas, one of the twelve families! I can crush you like a bug with a single word!\u201d\u201cSo noisy.\u201d Joshua\u2019s mild expression disappeared like a ghost.\u201cWha\u2014\u201d Muker finally came to his senses, only to see Joshua vanish from his sight.\u201cFirst and foremost, I have to crush that nasty mouth of yours.\u201d Joshua swung his fist.\u201cUgh!\u201d Veron flopped over like a sleepy baby. \u201cShut\u2014\u201dVeron groaned in pain, and his hand shot up to cover his mouth. Something fell from between his fingers and dropped to the ground with a quiet clatter.It was Veron\u2019s tooth.\u201cStop!\u201d Muker dashed between Veron and Joshua\u2019s fist, even though his legs trembled from the exertion.\u201cBe quiet. There\u2019s nothing left for you to do.\u201d Joshua\u2019s icy gaze pinned Muker in place. \u201cI\u2019m not soft enough to be merciful to my enemies\u2014don\u2019t try to interfere, or I\u2019ll crush you too. Are you willing to die?\u201dI\u2019m going to die\u2026\u00a0Muker\u2019s body was wracked with fear. The boy was dead serious about killing Muker and his master, Marquis of Villas or not.Muker dropped to his knees, and anyone could see it wasn\u2019t the same as when Joshua knocked him over earlier. Consciously or not, Muker was kneeling before Joshua to beg for forgiveness.\u201cPlease have mercy on us, just this once,\u201d Muker exclaimed, beating his head against the ground.Joshua was intimately familiar with a knight\u2019s pride. He knew it was more dear to a knight than their life and that Muker was willing to cast it away to keep his master safe.\u2026I remember him.\u00a0In his past life, this man accomplished nothing. He\u2019d bumbled about gaining nothing and losing everything for Joshua\u2019s sake. Joshua smiled sourly. He couldn\u2019t hold on to his wrath like this.\u201cI already told you, I\u2019m not charitable enough for mercy.\u201d Joshua gave Veron a hefty kick to the face, sending him rolling away. \u201cWhat a nuisance.\u201dEvery instinct Muker had screamed that the boy was about to kill them both.Joshua approached the unconscious aristocrat and snatched Veron\u2019s ring from his hand. It was embossed with swords and shields, marking Veron as the successor of Marquis Villas.\u201cI\u2019ll be here for a while,\u201d Joshua said in a low voice. \u201cTell him to come back right away if he wants this back. If he doesn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll sell it on the black market.\u201dThe audience could only watch blankly as Joshua\u2019s back disappeared down the stairs.\u201c...Are you crazy?\u201d Cain\u2019s gaze flicked between Muker and Veron. He took off after Joshua, and, for some reason, Iceline was quick to follow.That left the teary-eyed Count Rebrecca to clean up the mess.\u201c...Please take them to the nearest hospital.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We brought you here instead of the clinic because of your critical condition\u2026 My word, I was so worried.\u201dThe cost of visiting a temple was unimaginably high compared to a general clinic. No one but the rich would dare to set foot in the temple, where the amount of healing you got was defined by your \u201cdonations.\u201d Devotees, knights, and nobles were extorted for ludicrous sums of money across Igrant, yet they kept coming. The healing that holy magic could provide was incomparable to what a doctor could do.\u201cThe temple? Why\u2014?\u201dVeron\u2019s eyes popped wide open, and he shot up from his seat. He ran over to the mirror in the corner of the room.\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201dMuker quietly turned away; he\u2019d expected Veron to act like this.Whether it really worked or not, the holy magic had at least made the swelling go down\u2026 but that didn\u2019t matter.\u201cWHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS?!\u201d Veron sobbed and cursed and howled. \u201cMy teeth\u2026\u201dVeron tore at his hair. His clean, bright teeth neatly complimented his handsome face\u2014but now his beautiful, petal-like lips flapped over empty gums. Even his incisors were gone.\u201cMUKER!\u201d Veron\u2019s face flushed unbelievably red.\u201cYes, Young Master,\u201d Muker quietly responded.\u201cRight now\u2014Get that bastard right now!\u201d\u201cWith my strength, that would be impossible.\u201d\u201cUseless bastard\u2026 Knucklehead! You call yourself a knight after being defeated by that tiny bug?! When I get home, every knight that was with me is going to be severely punished\u2014including you, you imbecile.\u201d\u201cI obey.\u201d\u201cGo back and find out who the hell those Fredericks are. We\u2019ll find them and burn their estate down to the last strand of grass\u2014\u201d Veron paused. \u201c\u2014Ah, no. It\u2019d be better to cut their heads off one by one while I make that bastard watch. His parents, his brothers, his servants\u2026 NOW GATHER MY TROOPS AND BRING ME WHAT I WANT.\u201dMuker bit his lip pensively. \u201c...Impossible.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cWe have no reason to do that\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2018Reason\u2019, you say?! What are you talking about? The heir of Villas was humiliated\u2026 yet you say we have \u2018no reason\u2019?\u201d\u201cNo one would believe that a boy defeated an aristocrat\u2019s knights, especially the best of the family\u2019s knights\u2026 Even if they believed it, the honor of Villas would be deeply stained.\u201d\u201cHow is that important?\u201d\u201cIt is important, Young Master.\u201d Muker forcefully interrupted Veron\u2019s impending outburst. \u201cSometimes, the family\u2019s honor is more important than life.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 this useless knight wants to teach me now?\u201d\u201cEven if you say that,\u201d Muker continued, ignoring the violent light in Veron\u2019s eyes, \u201cthe Marquis might think otherwise.\u201d Veron shivered at the mention of his father. \u201cIf our defeat\u2014and revenge\u2014reaches the ears of the Marquis, he might not settle with just punishing us.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d Veron punched the mirror, scattering bloody shards over the expensive marble tiles. \u201c...Evidence. If I remember correctly, there\u2019s no evidence that that bastard beat us, right?! Like we planned, we have to silence everyone involved.\u201dMuker remained silent.\u201cWhat? What does your silence mean? Do you intend to refuse my order? Are you afraid of the lowly Rebreccas?!\u201d\u201cThe evidence\u2026\u201d Muker\u2019s face hardened. \u201cThe evidence was left there.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting this time?\u201d\u201cThe Villas insignia.\u201dVeron\u2019s head jerked.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not here,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThe Deon Ring.\u201dVeron\u2019s expression crumbled. The ring, lavishly carved with the sword-and-shield insignia of Villas, was more than a family heirloom: it was a masterpiece of the Magic Tower, a precious B-Class Deon Ring.\u201dThat shit is worth more than a castle!\u201cHe said that if you want it back, you have to return right away. He said he\u2019ll be waiting\u2026 but besides proof, he may have noticed it was more than just a trinket. Perhaps\u2026\u201d Muker\u2019s head drooped.\u00a0Perhaps everything was intentional.Muker\u2019s skin was riddled with goosebumps. It was hard to believe a child could have that kind of mind. He couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom what kind of person Ash would become as he grew.I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I do know that he isn\u2019t someone we should anger.\u201c...He didn\u2019t ask for anything difficult. But, for the time being, I recommend we bide our time.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do, then? Should we just give him the artifact?!\u201dMuker just stared stolidly at him.\u201cNo way\u2026 You\u2019re not telling me to apologize to him, right? Never! I can\u2019t do it! Me? Veron, apologizing to an insect?! Do you even know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cHe told you to come in person, but\u2026 let\u2019s send a proxy first.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYoung Master! Are you still here?\u201d Cain approached Joshua with a flabbergasted face. He thought Joshua had left the buildings, so he swept the entire area to find him. It turned out he\u2019d just been watching from the corner of the building.\u201cWere you looking for me?\u201d Joshua grinned when he noticed the sweat glistening on Cain\u2019s brow.\u201cYou left first, so I thought you would be around here somewhere.\u201d\u201cDid you help Count Rebrecca? It looks like you\u2019re having a hard time tidying up the place.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m simply carrying out your directions, master,\u201d Cain said, drawing a blank stare from Joshua.\u201cThat\u2019s what you call \u2018over-loyalty\u2019.\u201d Joshua laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s how I roll.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not style.\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. More importantly\u2026 are you going to be okay?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean, the Marquis of Villas\u2026 What\u2019s going to happen now? It doesn\u2019t seem like things will go according to plan.\u201d\u201cOf course it won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m referring to this.\u201d Joshua pointed to the ring resting on the table.\u201cDo you honestly believe Veron Shen Villas will come back here?\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen what do you mean?\u201d Cain eyed him questioningly.\u201cHe can\u2019t not come because I have his treasure in my hands.\u201d Joshua fiddled with the Villas signet. \u201cBut, perhaps, he will send a proxy\u2026 a representative trustworthy enough not to disclose sensitive information.\u201d\u201cAnd who might that be?\u201d\u201cArcadia is rife with rumors. They say Accent rules the Emperor\u2019s Night, but the House of Villas rules over Accent.\u201d\u201cAh, I know that!\u201d\u201cIf those rumors are true, he will come to me\u2026 and then, we know what happens next.\u201d Joshua flashed a beatific smile.\u201cMy word\u2026\u201d Cain\u2019s mind raced. The Marquis of Villas, one of the twelve families, was a major power in Arcadia. They could have coexisted peacefully, so why would his master suddenly make enemies of them? It turned out it was all part of his master\u2019s strategy to reach a particular goal\u2026Perhaps you will grow more powerful than even I anticipated\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knew her words were meant for someone else.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you,\u201d Joshua grumbled. He had other motivations, despite knowing that Iceline would become a world-famous archmage.\u201cStill\u2026\u201d Iceline clenched her delicate fists, determined to power through despite Joshua\u2019s tepid response. \u201cYou saved our family\u2019s honor, as well. We may have been in a difficult situation, but thanks to you, Young Master, I was able to keep my calm\u2026 Thank you.\u201dJoshua eyed Iceline curiously. The Iceline he remembered had never shown such a gentle personality. He recalled a beautiful woman standing effortlessly in the freezing cold of the mountain cliffs, a woman with no emotion, no blood, and no tears\u2026 A woman who could freeze her enemies at a whim. They called her the \u201ccold-blooded murderer\u201d.I thought her nickname was frighteningly accurate. Imagine angering the Iceline from the past\u2026\u00a0Just thinking about it made Joshua tremble slightly. He\u2019d heard stories about mercenaries angering Iceline\u2014they didn\u2019t end well.Her magic was entirely unique for her time, earning her the title \u201cIce Mage\u201d. The Magic Tower only granted monikers like these to the best in their field.\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Iceline continued, oblivious to Joshua\u2019s trepidation, \u201cif this incident puts the Young Master in jeopardy, we are to blame. So I thought that my family should be the one to take the initiative this time. Perhaps if we take a stand on your side, the Imperial family will listen.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that this situation is so serious.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWould they truly sit still if Count Rebrecca appears to testify against that idiot son of Marquis Villas? Do you think it will be over just like that?\u201d\u201cIt still concerns our family.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Young Lady.\u201dIceline\u2019s face hardened, drawing a burst of laughter from Joshua.\u201cIt\u2019s a pointless concern. Have you forgotten who I am?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dJoshua lifted a finger. \u201cIf you truly care\u2026 I hope you will do me a favor, later.\u201d\u201cWe can do it!\u201d Iceline reached out and grabbed Joshua\u2019s hand. Joshua was taken aback and then burst into laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s good you\u2019re agreeable.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, honestly.\u201d A masked man dropped from the third-floor roof, shaking his head. His surprise was palpable enough to almost make him trip as he landed. \u201cI\u2019d heard a monster had appeared in the Duchy, but I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t seen it myself.\u201dThe man ducked into a quiet alley and tossed his mask away. It was Jero, the branch manager of the Moon Gate.\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026\u201d The boy had left a deep and lasting impression on Jero, despite only meeting twice.\u201cHe was obviously aware that I was just observing him.\u201d Jero was observing Veron\u2019s rampage from the roof; he\u2019d done everything he could think of to prevent anyone from feeling his presence. Yet somehow, he\u2019d met Joshua\u2019s eyes. The smile Joshua gave him sent chills down his spine.Jero had sharp instincts from his years as an informant; sometimes, they told him good things, sometimes bad. His instincts were buzzing, but Jero opted not to act on them for the time being.Frankly, Jero had doubted Joshua\u2019s ability to find\u00a0that\u00a0item\u2014he\u2019d assumed that Joshua was just trying to cash in on some scraps of information he\u2019d stumbled upon. Jero had accepted the boy\u2019s request for the sake of getting a better read on him.The location of the Orbis heirloom that Joshua asked for wasn\u2019t particularly valuable information\u2026 It could be tracked down with only a few facts to work off of. In contrast, Joshua had smashed every expectation. Jero saw the potential for Joshua to become priceless in the not-too-distant future.Jero clenched his fists.\u00a0Now I need to adjust my plans.The informant made his way to the slums on the outskirts of Arcadia and cautiously approached one of the old houses. By all appearances, it was just like any other house in the area: dangling planks, broken glass everywhere, a few missing bricks.The direct line for reporting was reserved for urgent dispatches. It was only known to executive-level or higher members of the Moon Gate, and the meeting location changed frequently.\u201cI only follow the master\u2019s orders\u2026 All decisions were his.\u201dJero threw himself towards the pitch-black room.An hour had passed since they\u2019d finished cleaning up the restaurant and the Rebreccas had departed.\u201cHe really came, Young Master\u2026\u201d Cain was surprised to see an overweight man struggling his way up to the second floor. \u201cBaron Accent Provalum\u2026\u201dDespite his low rank, he was infamous for overseeing Arcadia\u2019s black market, the largest on the continent. It was not a job to boast of, but he was proud of it. Provalum, a baron, had influence rivaling that of many counts.\u201cWho- Where is the son of the Fredericks?\u201d Provalum glanced around nervously.\u201cThis one is\u2026 I mean, this Young Master here is the son of the Fredericks, Ash pen Frederick.\u201dProvalum was astonished.\u00a0He\u2019s\u2026 just a kid?\u00a0However, he was a master of business and schooled his emotions before anyone noticed his surprise.\u201cThe name\u2019s Accent Provalum,\u201d he said with a warm smile. \u201cIt\u2019s such an honor to meet the son of the Fredericks.\u201dProvalum then bowed his head, much to Cain\u2019s amazement. No matter how low, a baron had no reason to bow to someone like Joshua, and Provalum\u2019s true power was far beyond any baron. He had no business treating a fallen noble\u2019s son like this.Joshua, on the other hand, remained expressionless. \u201cI believe I told that jerk, Veron, to come to me himself\u2026 He dared send a pawn?\u201dCain and Provalum reeled with shock.\u201cI, uhh\u2026 What did you say?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, if you\u2019re not aware of the family that Young Master Veron comes from\u2014\u201d\u201cDoes it make a difference? He mocked my family; now, he owes me his life. Why do I need to know his family?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Provalum choked down a retort. He knew Ash had the upper hand here. \u201cThat\u2019s correct, Young Master. You saved his life, so it\u2019s up to you if you want to know about him or not. You were raised so well.\u201d The baron rubbed his hands together with an uneasy smile. \u201cThat aside\u2026 What Young Master Ash took from the boy is a priceless Villas treasure\u2014it was their signet. Now, why don\u2019t you return it to its rightful owner\u2026?\u201dJoshua scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll say it again: if he wants this back, he has to come here himself.\u201d Joshua casually tossed the Villas signet ring in the air like a toy.\u201cTell him I\u2019ll melt it down if he doesn\u2019t come here in person,\u201d he said, snatching the ring out of the air.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014!\u201d Provalum\u2019s life flashed before his eyes.\u00a0This little scumbag!He\u2019d love to rip the boy to shreds, but he knew what had transpired.\u00a0It\u2019s unbelievable, but, knowing who it came from, I can\u2019t ignore it.\u201cYoung Master Veron couldn\u2019t come right now because he is still weak,\u201d Provalum said, quelling his rage. \u201cHe needs to rest.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not as strong as I imagined. Sorry,\u201d Joshua muttered, much to Provalum\u2019s chagrin.Patience, Provalum told himself.\u201cAlright.\u201d Joshua\u2019s lips curled into a cheeky smile. \u201cI thought of something.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cJust send that knight named Muker that was always next to that bastard.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhen that knight comes, I\u2019ll negotiate with him. Also\u2026\u201d Joshua eyed Provalum\u2019s hand. \u201cWhen something goes missing, it has to be replaced, right? Since I did you a favor, I\u2019d like you to fulfill one of my requests.\u201d\u201cWhat request?\u201d\u201cThat ring you\u2019re wearing looks quite expensive. Hand it over.\u201dProvalum saw his life crumble before his very eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s worse, you seem completely indifferent about it.\u201d\u201cI had to.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJoshua tossed him a lazy glance and shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re implying that I extorted the heirloom from him, I didn\u2019t\u2026 I gave him a chance to prove his worth as a lackey, so it\u2019s only natural for him to pay me for my time.\u201d\u201cHow can you say such a shameful thing\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018shameful\u2019?\u201d Joshua returned Cain\u2019s stare with a bewildered expression.\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how far you\u2019ve come\u2026 You couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye, before.\u201d Cain shrugged. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll ever become like you? No, wait\u2026 I think it\u2019s already happening.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you always like that?\u201dCain carefully avoided Joshua\u2019s gaze and whistled nonchalantly. \u201cWhat a sight. These girls from Arcadia are real eye candy. The way they walk and talk is so elegant!\u201d\u201cYeah, enjoy yourself.\u201d Joshua chuckled and turned his attention to the object resting in his palm.This is the Orbis family heirloom, known as the \u201cElf\u2019s Tears\u201d.\u00a0It had a distinct leaf shape and a subtle green hue. The only reason this apparently-unremarkable ring received a moniker like that was because of the legends of the Orbis family\u2019s relationship with the high elves.For now, it\u2019s just a pretty relic of a defunct family. That information only comes to light much later.\u00a0The world would learn that the inheritance contained exceptional powers thanks to the words of the high elves, who had appeared on the continent for the first time in centuries.The head of the Orbis family had made yearly pilgrimages into the Elven Forest, which, for the most part, was adamantly opposed to human visits. Only the Orbis patriarch could think about such a thing.The elves had an isolationist attitude. In the eyes of the elves, who value nature and the trees, humans are animals who destroy the elves\u2019 beloved forests and kidnap them for their beauty\u2014and then use them as sex slaves to sate their vile desires.To protect themselves and their homes, the elves gathered in the great forest at the southern tip of the continent and erected a massive barrier the size of several major cities put together. Even the elves, naturally born with magical abilities, found it nigh-impossible to construct such a barrier. Dozens of high elves died in the process\u2014except one. One high elf didn\u2019t die.Fast forward a hundred years, and the elves\u2019 hate for humans had spiraled out of control. They rallied around the single remaining high elf, dubbing it the \u201cElenbers\u201d, their ruler. The issue is that humans were practically poisonous to the elves, who shuddered at the thought of even meeting a human.The rest of the story was a bit blurry in Joshua\u2019s mind, but he knew the essential details.\u201cJerath Dick Orbis,\u201d Joshua grumbled. The last head of the Orbis family had vanished ten years ago along with the rest of the family. He\u2019d been reported missing, but Joshua knew he was dead. In all of the forty years of Joshua\u2019s previous life, Jerath had remained absent. It was quite likely the entire family had died as soon as the household collapsed.I\u2019m sure he was tormented. He was the only person on the continent who could enter and exit the Elven Forest\u2014those dogs and pigs in power couldn\u2019t leave him alone.Jerath Dick Orbis had said nothing about the Elven Forest until his family was wiped out. Then he vanished from the face of the continent. The Elenburs came to the continent after hearing the news and found Jerath\u2019s child in dire circumstances, serving as a servant to another noble household.She wept, apologizing, and the tears streamed down the back of her hand, seeping into the ring she was wearing. That ring would eventually be known as the \u201cElf\u2019s Tears\u201d to the rest of the world.Then she became seriously ill and died not long after\u2026 I guess it\u2019s an honorable story because they died protecting what they cared about the most.What a terrible fate.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d Cain\u2019s voice drew Joshua away from his thoughts. \u201cCan you tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Joshua swallowed his words and just shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just a bit tired. Did you say something?\u201dCain tilted his head curiously. \u201cWe\u2019re home? We\u2019ve been here for quite some time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Joshua nodded. They\u2019d arrived at Joshua\u2019s home for the foreseeable future.Regardless of whatever else is happening, it\u2019s a terrific area to practice in peace. But\u2026\u00a0Joshua\u2019s expression hardened as he glanced over the building.\u00a0It was absolutely terrible if you were trying to protect someone.\u00a0The thought had been making his head throb since he\u2019d arrived in the capital.Joshua finally came to a decision. \u201cCain.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI believe it would be best for my mother to live in Duke Agnus\u2019s residence, since it\u2019s more central and closer to the Palace.\u201dCain paused for a moment before nodding in understanding. \u201cAs the Young Master says, this is clearly not the right place for Lady Lucia to live. Even if you\u2019re displeased, I believe it is correct for her to live where the Duke is. More importantly, she\u2019d be truly alone when the Young Master enters the academy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you a favor.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Cain was taken aback by Joshua\u2019s abrupt reply.\u201cFor the time being, I want you to protect my mother on my behalf.\u201d\u201cYou mean you want me to be Lady Lucia\u2019s escort knight?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Joshua nodded.\u201cHowever, if I do that the Young Master will be in serious danger,\u201d Cain replied with a stiff expression. \u201cEven low-ranking aristocrats from the countryside with unknown ancestries have at least two knights beside them. Ignorance and contempt are the bare minimum you could expect, among a slew of other annoyances\u2026 Given the Young master\u2019s nature, I know you\u2019ll never stand for what will take place before your eyes. You\u2019ll need me to stop you from acting, ahead of time.\u201dSeeing as Joshua\u2019s mouth remained firmly shut, Cain took it that he\u2019d hit the nail firmly on the head.\u201cAdditionally, Veron Shen Villas is also an academy student. It might be a stretch, but I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be. I truly desire to be \u2018silent\u2019.\u201d Joshua grinned at Cain\u2019s apprehensive expression. \u201cI\u2019ll spend my time quietly, like a dead mouse. I specialize in solitude, believe it or not. I\u2019ve had more than my fair share of being ignored and insulted.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026 true?\u201d Cain struggled to wrap his mind around Joshua\u2019s words.It was true.\u00a0The bastard pariah\u2026 the stable\u2026\u00a0Cain had forgotten about Young Master Joshua\u2019s history.\u201cI hate to see your miserable expression.\u201d Joshua chuckled at Cain\u2019s stiff expression.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d Cain pressed his head against the floor.\u201cMay I ask a favor of you? It\u2019s for me, but it\u2019s also for you.\u201d Joshua\u2019s words made Cain raise his head. \u201cI need a subordinate that I can trust to watch my tack. I don\u2019t need a weak or drowsy guy who dies before I do on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201dJoshua grinned widely. \u201cWe should ask Duke Agnus to teach you the sword.\u201dCain\u2019s pupils dilated\u2014that only meant one thing. Cain knew it was not in Joshua\u2019s nature to bow or apologize to anyone. Yet here he was, making such a promise.\u201cYour words\u2014\u201d\u201cCain,\u201d Joshua interrupted. \u201cThis is a request, not a demand\u2026 Listen carefully to what I\u2019m saying.\u201dJoshua quietly bowed his head, startling Cain. Was there anyone else like this in Cain\u2019s life?Never\u2026Cain sighed heavily.\u201cRaise your head,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you bowing your head to anyone\u2014me included.\u201d\u201cThis is fine for me\u2026 but this is my Lord\u2019s request.\u201d Cain smirked sarcastically. \u201cShouldn\u2019t debts be repaid? I\u2019m hoping the Young Master will also grant me a wish.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll listen,\u201d Joshua said with a laugh.The smirk fell from Cain\u2019s face, replaced with a solemn expression. \u201cPlease don\u2019t force me to bow to anyone but my master.\u201dJoshua and Cain looked deeply into each others\u2019 eyes for a while. Cain bore witness to the burning passion in Joshua\u2019s deeply sunken eyes, hotter than an erupting volcano.\u201cYes\u2026 I will do that\u2026 In the name of Joshua Sanders,\u201d Joshua whispered just barely loud enough for Cain to hear. But that was enough for the knight.\u201cMy lord,\u201d Cain said with a smile and a vigorous nod. \u201cI wish you all the best in the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was nothing he\u2019d missed more than this, and the memory was excruciating every time. Even now, as he gazed at his mother, it seemed like a dream.I\u00a0will\u00a0protect you this time.\u201cThank you, Sir Cain, for looking after my needy son.\u201d Lucia gracefully bowed her head.\u201cOh no, Lady Lucia.\u201d Cain scratched his head, flustered, and waved his hand. \u201cRather, I am eternally grateful to the Young Master for allowing me to serve him.\u201d Lucia gave him a dubious look. \u201cIt may be a little rude of me to say so, but my Lady has a great son.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201d Lucia beamed. She was so preoccupied with her work at the Duke\u2019s mansions that Lucia didn\u2019t pay much attention to Joshua. As a mother, she felt bad for her son\u2014but it seemed that Joshua had blossomed into a great young man. Who wouldn\u2019t be proud?Lucia strode towards the kitchen with an undisguisable bounce to her step. \u201cHave you two eaten? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had the opportunity to demonstrate my skills.\u201d\u201cLady Lucia! My word\u2014There\u2019s a maid. You should utilize the staff the Duke gave\u2014\u201dJoshua stopped Cain with a raised hand and a tiny shake of his head. \u201cI hate to say it, but my mother is a fantastic cook; her lamb soup, in particular, is\u2026\u201d Joshua took a deep breath and shot Cain a thumbs-up. \u201cIt\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201dCain watched Lucia disappear into the kitchen. \u201cThat aside\u2026 I have a question. That ring\u2014does it contain the heritage of the Orbis family? Does it have any unique powers? It appears completely ordinary.\u201d\u201cA unique object has to be reawakened in a unique way.\u201d Joshua held the ring up. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just sealed.\u201dJust then, as if responding to Joshua\u2019s comments, the ring floated upwards and shook the air. Its outer surface peeled away, allowing strangely-shaped characters to emerge.\u201cRunes?! Are these runes?!\u201d\u00a0How does the young master know about the runes? They should be the sole knowledge of powerful wizards!A rune was more than just a character; each rune possessed a unique ability on its own, which could not be acquired simply by copying their appearance. Only high-ranking wizards of at least Fifth-Class, calculating complex mathematics formulae, could make a real rune appear.And Joshua was casually reciting them\u2026Is he truly a magic swordsman?\u00a0Cain\u2019s astonishment swelled.Joshua felt like dying.\u00a0I was ready, but\u2026\u00a0He bit his lip, eyes darting from place to place with intense focus.Contrary to Cain\u2019s belief, the runes didn\u2019t fall from his lips so lightly. These runes were not the same as those used by the wizards\u2014if any of them saw this, their eyes would roll backwards and pass out. This was an ancient rune language.This is the last one.\u201c\u16b1.\u201d Joshua spat out the final rune.A swarm of pure white lights exploded forth as the resonating air reached a crescendo, engulfing their surroundings in a blinding light.In the very center of Igrant, a marvelous, pure ivory tower stretched into the sky, buttressed by skyscrapers on three sides. This was the holy land of wizards, the Magic Tower.At the top of the Tower was a large round table with exactly seven chairs around it\u2014the meeting spot of the seven highest-ranking wizards in the Tower, known as the \u201cSeven Magicians\u201d. They gathered at this table to handle the Tower\u2019s most critical issues.The meetings were a rare occurrence, given the strongly individualistic impulses of the busy wizards. However, they were gathered now, for the first time in a very long time.An old, crooked man with a bent back sat at the table\u2019s highest point. His long white robe draped over his wizened body, and his long beard fell all the way to his frail chest. At first glance, he looked too weak to even move himself.But no one on the continent could ignore him. He was, without a doubt, first among the Seven Magicians. After all, he was the leader of the Seven, Ian Teon Murray.Ian\u2019s immaculate gray eyes darted around the table. \u201cThe Red Flame, Thunderstorm, and Void\u2019s seats are empty\u2026 What\u2019s going on with these empty seats I see?\u201dA middle-aged man on Ian\u2019s left with an unruly, haphazard beard responded with a heavy voice. \u201cAs you are aware, Red Flame and Void are always out of reach. Even if we could reach them, it\u2019s difficult to make them come here. The Thunderstorm, however, I believe, left for the capital yesterday. I also believe he sends his greetings to everyone here.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201d Ian clicked his tongue in displeasure. \u201cThis is the start of our twenty-seventh regular meeting. Despite the fact that there are only four of us, the meeting cannot be postponed. There is an agenda item on the schedule: the conference\u2019s main agenda is the \u2018Primordial Stone\u2019.\u201dThe man on the left remained expressionless, but the other two peoples\u2019 bored expressions roused with interest.A man in his early thirties opened his mouth. \u201cWhy are we talking about this again?\u201d\u201c...Be courteous, Storm. This is a plenary session.\u201d\u201cYes sir\u2026 Will do, old man Earth.\u201d Storm pouted his lips.\u201cThis is a rarity,\u201d Ian said. \u201cThe one who doesn\u2019t even show his nose is here.\u201d\u201cWell said, my Lord\u2014I mean, as the High Magician said, we have an issue to solve. I believe I heard a rumor that the Magma has vanished.\u201d\u201cNot only has the Magma vanished, so has Bronto.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d The young man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDo you have any other information?\u201dAn attractive middle-aged woman spoke up for the first time. She had pure white hair and blue eyes like a lake, befitting the owner of the Frozen Seat. \u201cOnly the Magician\u2019s Tower has access to information on the Primordial Stones\u2026 A leak would be a serious issue, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as you say,\u201d Ian replied. \u201cAlthough there is some information regarding the individual who took the Magma, it is unknown whether Bronto truly rose into the sky or was returned to the ground.\u201d\u201cThat Thunderstorm guy left suddenly,\u201d the young man mused. \u201cDoes he have anything to do with this, or is he just trying to find out more?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t any information,\u201d replied Earth, the middle-aged man. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it has anything to do with Bronto, but there was another odd bit of information.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThere are rumors that a magical swordsman appeared near Bronto\u2019s location.\u201d\u201cOh, a magical swordsman?\u201d The young man licked his lips.\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d The woman kicked her chair aside and leapt to her feet. \u201cDid\u00a0he\u00a0show up?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t him. This time, the magical swordsman\u2026\u201d Earth spoke in hushed tones. \u201cThey say he\u2019s only nine years old this year.\u201d\u201cWha\u2014what?\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d\u201c...There is no definitive information,\u201d Ian said. \u201cBut, did I mention that Bronto was discovered in the Avalon Empire?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMarcus, keep an eye on Magma. Ask Thunderstorm to help, if you want. Even if Magma was discovered, there\u2019s little we could do about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Marcus\u2014Earth\u2014nodded his head.\u201cAnd Theta, I say this because you\u2019re still young: don\u2019t be conceited. People won\u2019t merely pass by if you make a mistake in your haste, no matter how great you are. I know this from experience.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m causing accidents every day?\u201d Theta, the Storm, pouted.Frozen shouted excitedly, \u201cCould it be his descendant? I can\u2019t imagine a lifetime without a magical swordsman!\u201d\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Ian sighed. \u201cI think you\u2019re jumping to conclusions.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s his descendant, but\u2026 it\u2019s more likely that they\u2019re unrelated.\u201dThe woman\u2019s head snapped around to face Marcus. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAccording to the rumors, it\u2019s the son of Duke Aden von Agnus.\u201dA flash of surprise cut through the woman\u2019s dazed expression. \u201cIf it\u2019s Aden von Agnus, perhaps\u2014\u201dIan slammed his fist against the table and swept his eyes over the Magicians. \u201cAt this point, nothing is certain. Please keep an eye on the situation and refrain from taking rash actions.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cEveryone, get out of here.\u201dWith Ian\u2019s abrupt ending, the three stood up and walked out, leaving Ian alone at the pinnacle of the Tower.\u201cThe world\u2026 is changing at a breakneck pace. Whether this is good or bad remains to be seen\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when the seal broke to reveal its true form, it was bizarre to look at. It had the appearance of a conventional woman\u2019s ring, but, despite its slim width, ancient runes were densely etched on its smooth, leaf-like, rust-colored surface.Is it possible to engrave runes in such detail with current human technology?\u201cYou\u2019re going to swallow a fly.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Cain regained his composure and shifted his attention to Joshua.\u201c\u2014Young Master! Are you all right!\u201d Cain dashed over to his master.Joshua watched him run over with silent curiosity, but his body was drenched with sweat. One might even think that someone had poured water on him.It was unavoidable. Using ordinary runes demanded intense concentration, but these were ancient runes.\u201cA doctor, yes! No, I\u2019ll summon a priest!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so noisy. It\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014 Young Master\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Joshua proudly squared his shoulder, adopting a picture-perfect posture.\u201cI\u2026 I trust you, Master.\u201d Cain stepped back. A knight simply had to trust and obey his master.Joshua turned back to the floating object. \u201cDo you, perhaps, know what this thing is called?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 do not know.\u201d\u201cSome call it the \u2018Elf\u2019s Tear\u2019.\u201d\u201cThe Elf\u2019s\u2026 Tear?\u201dJoshua nodded. \u201cElves are an inherently pure race. They are one of the few species with the same intelligence as humans, but they are entirely distinct in that they lack the same plethora of desires that humans have.\u201cTheir race is incapable of telling a single lie. This \u2018Elf\u2019s Tear\u2019 is shed by elves\u2014the high elves, known as the King of Elves, in particular\u2014out of genuine sadness. Dwarves, the artists of the gods, etched these runes.\u201d\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d Cain\u2019s jaw dropped.Dwarves and elves. Both were hostile to humans and highly isolationist; it was rare for the average person to see either even once in their life.The dwarven race had an unrivaled capacity for creation\u2014even the simplest dwarf-made longsword held incredible value. Similarly, the high magical potential of the elves would allow them to create high-value artifacts.However, a relic crafted from the Elf\u2019s Tears and dwarven runes was unprecedented. Cain had no idea how much an object like that would cost, never mind what abilities it would hold.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s acceptable for me to ask what kind of power this object has\u2026 But I am very curious.\u201d\u201cI know a little bit about its power\u2026 I believe that in an emergency, a magical barrier\u2014shield magic\u2014will activate to protect the user until they\u2019re safe.\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Cain dropped to his knees, to Joshua\u2019s bemusement. \u201cCan you use the artifact?\u201d Joshua stared incredulously at the knight. \u201cNo, I mean\u2026 since the Young Master is a monster, I guess you don\u2019t need such an artifact. Ugh, what am I doing\u2026 What am I saying?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I am unable to use this artifact.\u201d Joshua gave Cain a small smile. The knight\u2019s face rapidly shifted from surprise to disappointment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Joshua continued, \u201cbut it seems you misunderstand something: the ring isn\u2019t flawed or anything. If I tried to use it, it would just be a pretty ring on my calloused fingers.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe High Elves created this ring for the Orbis family\u2019s children. They couldn\u2019t find the patriarch, Jerath Dick Orbis, so this protects his offspring in his stead.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 is it forbidden for anyone other than the Orbis children?\u201d\u201cWell, a man can\u2019t use it\u2026 Because Jerath Dick Orbis\u2019s child was a woman.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Cain let out a short exclamation, much to Joshua\u2019s amusement.\u201cI had an idea, but I didn\u2019t know you had such an outspoken personality.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018outspoken,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018honest\u2019! A straightforward person like me will never attack someone from behind.\u201dHowever, Cain\u2019s complaints only made Joshua laugh more.Cain grumbled and pushed himself to his feet. \u201cWhat are you planning on doing with the artifact?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to give this to my mother.\u201d\u201cWith the best knights and the most powerful artifact protecting her, no one could harm Lady Lucia.\u201d Cain bowed deeply, hiding a sneaky smile from the perplexed Joshua. \u201cSo, Young Master\u2026 Leave Lady Lucia\u2019s safety in my hands. I guarantee the safety of Lady Lucia, even if it costs me my life.\u201dJoshua\u2019s lips curled upward.\u201cI believe you.\u201dOne could easily lose themselves in the house\u2019s many rooms. However, it remained deserted; the only thing it held was a mana crystal ball for communication, deep in the center.The sound of footfalls echoed through the chamber, breaking the motionless silence. A man\u2019s figure emerged. It was Jero, the man who introduced himself to Joshua as the manager of Moon Gate\u2019s Arcadia branch.He approached the crystal ball and laid his hand on it, causing it to sparkle brilliantly and resonate. The light revealed why the space was so large: a magic communication circle occupied half the floor, centered around the crystal ball. The circle blocked any disturbances from passing through its circumference. The exorbitant amount of money invested into this modest magical circle was just another demonstration of the Moon Gate\u2019s enormous power.The balls\u2019 resonance reached a crest, giving birth to a figure slowly rising above the circle.\u201cI greet you, Master.\u201d Jero\u2019s posture was incredibly polite, despite the vague projection.\u201cYour rush to contact me is, after all, because of that child?\u201d The voice coming from the ball sounded filtered, disguising the speaker\u2019s gender.\u201cYes\u2026 There was a small incident. I believe Joshua von Agnus is more than he appears.\u201d\u201cI had a feeling he was one-of-a-kind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a feeling; he really is one-of-a-kind\u2014\u201d\u201cThe tower is already making its move.\u201d The doll in the crystal ball cut off the end of Jero\u2019s sentence.\u201cAre you talking about the Magic Tower?\u201d Jero\u2019s pupils shrank.\u201cThere are rumors that one of the Seven Magicians is about to move personally to investigate rumors that Enslot\u2019s progeny had appeared. I have been looking for that man in the Tower for a long time.\u201dJero\u2019s face flushed with surprise. \u201cEnslot\u2019s descendants!\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s only a surface explanation for the ruckus that\u2019s stirring up the Tower. Most likely, the Origin Stone is the true reason. It\u2019s more believable than that sort of rumor, you know.\u201d\u201cThe rumor\u2026 I\u2019m curious about the rumored descendant of Enslot.\u201d Jero\u2019s belied his disbelief.The hitherto-unheard-of magic swordsman, and the mysterious disappearance of his descendants\u2026\u201cJoshua von Agnus. The rumor revolves around that child.\u201d\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u201cIt makes no difference if the rumors are true or not,\u201d the figure continued. \u201cInevitably, great powers will converge on that child. The Imperial family of Avalon, the Magic Tower\u2026\u201d Startlingly, the figure continued to speak to Jero. \u201cUntil I know if the red coin was there or not\u2014 No, no\u2026 The tremendous tides of fate will surely pull that child under. I wish I could return to Arcadia, but\u2026\u201dJero quickly regained his composure. \u201cAre you going to approach the master directly?\u201d\u201c...The company\u2019s internal conflict is still ongoing. Going back is unrealistic\u2014and I\u2019m not sure if that child is genuinely looking for the red coin.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dJero\u2019s face hardened.\u00a0I had assured the Young master that the conflict within the company was over, but this was not the case. It was simply hidden because there was no need to show all of our cards right away.\u00a0Perhaps it is the only card that could put a clean end to the company\u2019s long, awful civil war.\u201cHail the master!\u201d Jero hastily knelt as the light in the mana orb began to dim.Jero pulled himself up and stared into the vast, empty space when the light faded away.\u201cHahhhh\u2026 What do I do now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Time to start my six-year life in the Academy. My plan is just to lie low and regain my strength.Joshua had already consumed a lot of his spare power to demonstrate his potential. It was mentally and physically exhausting. Therefore, he had no intention of drawing attention to himself, even though he was in disguise.Now, what do I do about this?\u00a0Joshua scowled at the room. There were three beds and several pieces of furniture in this larger-than-expected room. In other words, he had roommates.Hmm\u2026 Roommates. I hope they won\u2019t be assholes.The door suddenly opened with a clunk.\u201cOh? I wasn\u2019t the first one here?\u201d The boy who had just entered the room looked at Joshua with wide eyes.He had exotic purple hair and big, bright purple eyes to match. Despite his slight figure, he seemed healthy, and his skin was deeply tanned.\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you, new friend!\u201d The new kid walked over to Joshua with a playful smile and clasped his hands. \u201cI\u2019m Agareth! Agareth kun Douglas.\u201dJoshua stared blankly at the too-bright boy for a long moment.\u201cI\u2019m Ash\u2026 Ash pen Frederick.\u201d\u201cFrederick? Hmmm, I\u2019ve never heard of that name before.\u201d The kid frowned, making Joshua laugh. Joshua had expected Agareth\u2019s reaction.Agareth was a member of the Empire\u2019s top 1%; he and his peers were raised in aristocratic households where their every need was met. In the Academy, your status was determined solely by your family\u2019s power. What sort of perspective would the Academy imprint on their minds in this gathering of young lords?I\u2019ll remain silent and calm.\u00a0With a resigned expression, Joshua tried to turn away.\u201cAre you alright? Ash, look after me for this year.\u201d Agareth pumped their joined hands up and down. \u201cFirstly, I must unpack. There isn\u2019t much time left to prepare for the event.\u201d The boy gestured to the luggage piled up behind him.The Douglas clan\u2026\u00a0Joshua\u2019s first impression wasn\u2019t bad; he was a noble but not boastful like the others. It was usually children of lower aristocrats who acted like this. It was probably for the best\u2014it was much better than the kids who flaunted their family\u2019s authority like it was their own.\u201cI guess I\u2019m the last one?\u201d A voice from the doorway made Agareth and Joshua\u2019s heads turn.\u201cYou!\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes sparkled with wonder.\u201cAh, you!\u201dA typical forest would soothe the mind with its rich green light\u2014but this forest was tinted a melancholy magenta color, and seemed to be dark even in broad daylight.The Black Monster Forest. Its very name conjured an image of being devoured by the abyss.A man\u2019s voice sounds quietly through the din of monsters\u2019 noise.\u201cA ray of light pierces the vastness of the sky.\u201d His voice attracted the attention of every monster in the area\u2014hundreds of monsters, at the very least. A sight that would make even the calmest person tremble.The man didn\u2019t seem to mind and continued reciting his spell. \u201cGather at my fingertips, lightning, and strike down all foes that stand in my way.\u201dThe first to rush at the man was a dark troll, and the rest of the creatures soon followed. Their screams cut through the pitch-black gloom over the rumble of hundreds of footsteps.\u201cA violent downpour of light falls upon their heads.\u201d The man finished his spell with a disinterested expression as if it all had nothing to do with him. A dazzling white light gathered at his fingertips, transforming into innumerable raindrops that soaked into the dry ground.\u201cLightning Rain.\u201dA flash of light.It was over before the monsters could scream. For a moment, the darkness split. Then the sky was darkened by a thunderstorm; electrical currents raced across the ground, illuminating only the dark coals of the incinerated monster. Nothing else remained to attest to their existence.\u201cThat\u2019s my magic\u2026 How would you compare it to that child\u2019s \u2018strength\u2019?\u201dWhen he didn\u2019t receive a response, the mage turned. An obese man, trembling like shaken gelatin, screamed as he approached. To him, the mage\u2019s footsteps sounded like the reaper\u2019s boots. It was Viscount Vig Beck Steck, Lord of the Locke Estate.\u201cHey! I asked you a question\u2026 and I demand an answer. I know you saw something\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really are a Sixth-Class Mage\u2026\u201d\u201cWho you think I am or am not is up to you\u2026 But I want you to answer my questions, and I don\u2019t have the time or patience to listen to bullshit.\u201dVig screamed convulsively. \u201cI am a noble of the Great Avalon Empire! Do you think you can get away with this if they hear of this preposterous treatment?!\u201d\u201cEmpire?\u201d A strange smile flickered across the man\u2019s lips. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come if I was afraid of something like that.\u201dVig\u2019s eyes bulged as the man\u2019s frightening energy poured down on him. The Viscount had spent his whole life relying on his ability to read people; the man in front of him certainly didn\u2019t seem like he was lying.The Empire won\u2019t care.\u00a0This man could end Vig\u2019s life right now; he was a god, for all intents and purposes.\u201cAh! Your magic is obviously more powerful! I am a stranger to magic, but I am certain of it! Even after he used the same lightning bolt, a large number of creatures survived!\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the man said with undisguised pride. \u201cThere are innumerable schools of magic; even the same spell can vary wildly in power depending on your school. Even if the child is a direct descendent of\u00a0him\u00a0and a powerful magician like myself\u2026 It can\u2019t be that strong.\u201cBesides, he wasn\u2019t the type of person to use lightning as his primary weapon.\u201d The mage frowned, scowled, rubbed his chin, and frowned some more. \u201cAlso, why did he take Bronto? But there are consequences\u2026\u201dThe man jerked his head to the side. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll have to meet the boy in person. Obviously, Duke Agnus\u2019s estate isn\u2019t easy to sneak into, but\u2014\u201d\u201cWait, wait, wait! Hold for a second! If you\u2019re thinking of seeing Joshua von Agnus, you\u2019re making a serious mistake!\u201dThe man gave him a dark look. \u201cAm I doing things incorrectly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, but he followed the Duke to the capital. I was told he\u2019d be admitted to the Academy\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Academy?\u201d The man smirked. The Agnus Estate was not a particularly big issue, but Arcadia was a different story. The walls had eyes there; he couldn\u2019t run around, no matter how strong he was.\u201cIt\u2019s a real problem\u2026\u201d The mage grimaced.\u201cI, I will assist!\u201d\u201c...What?\u201dFor a moment, Vig forgot his fear. \u201cI hate that kid\u2014that bastard! I couldn\u2019t even begin to tell you why I hate him! I\u2019ll help you kill that kid.\u201dThe man stared at Vig for a moment and burst out laughing. Finally, he drew the hood of his blue rob off his head. The man within the robe was very ordinary, save for his pleasantly deep voice. He was middle-aged, with light blue hair and blue eyes of a more common shade than Joshua\u2019s deep blue irises.But there was one feature that drew Vig\u2019s attention.\u201cSterope\u2019s mark! Why do you\u2014?\u201d Under his right eye was a circle surrounding a lightning bolt.He\u2026 as expected.\u201cYou\u2019re one of the Seven Magicians!\u201d Vig\u2019s voice exploded with emotion. \u201cThe Thunderbolt! Jack Steropes!\u201dJack smiled widely.\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, gesturing to Vig\u2019s bloated body. \u201cI can\u2019t just let a little piggy lend me a hand, no matter how urgent the problem is, right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said I didn\u2019t care, but it could be a pain if my identity is revealed.\u201d\u201cDo you mean you\u2019re planning to kill me? If I, an Imperial nobleman, suddenly vanished, the Empire, or the Duke of Agnus, would immediately go looking for me! Your true identity will be revealed\u2014\u201d\u201cYeah, no.\u201d Jack lifted his hand with a sunny smile. \u201cPork kebab is the best way to cook a pig.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014!\u201d\u201cDie.\u201d Jack flicked his fingers, piercing Vig\u2019s swollen bulk with a single lightning bolt.Vig\u2019s screams echoed through the peaceful woodland.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The power vacuum left by Emperor Marcus\u2019s disappearance plunged the already-weakened Empire into an all-out Civil War. The numbers of soldiers\u2014and their accompanying Masters\u2014on both sides was astonishing.Joshua couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the fight was really worth it. Even the Masters avoided the conflict; they weren\u2019t dumb enough to risk their lives in a war against their own people.Hundreds of battles, big and small, took place over the ten-year civil war. Only three engagements garnered casualties in the ten thousand in all that time. Critically, the Second Prince lost all of his supporters in those battles. He lost half of his army in the first battle and most of his territory in the second. The third battle was\u2026Truly, the Second Prince\u2019s juvenile tactics lost him all of his forces except the Masters on his side. Regardless, the Masters jumped over to the First Prince\u2019s side like they were turning a new leaf, and the Second Prince\u2019s most important men, including Babel von Agnus, became the First Prince\u2019s prisoners.That aside, the First Prince welcomed the remains of the Second Prince\u2019s army with open arms. In the aftermath of the devastating Civil War, the First Prince offered them compassion for the sake of the nation. The Second Prince\u2019s allies were demoted, and a supervising organization was founded.But then, out of nowhere, two people\u2019s hands reached out to the dying Empire, like the light at the end of the ten-year-long tunnel. The Fourth Prince of the Avalon Empire, Kaiser von Britten, hoarded his knowledge and spared no words of comfort. Beside him was a master of tactics, said to carry a thousand stratagems in his mind; a war god, who led demon-like warriors to victory.Icarus, Heaven\u2019s Mind.\u00a0And here he was, standing a few feet away from Joshua and Agareth. Joshua had to wonder if it was coincidence or fate. Icarus, like Joshua, was murdered at the hands of Kaiser von Britten, their trusted lord.Joshua stared at Icarus.\u00a0But at that time, he was obviously\u2026Icarus had pale, sky-blue hair and piercing blue eyes, charged with energy like a loaded gun. His features were nothing short of angelic, like a piece of Heaven sent down to Earth. He looked like a woman at first glance, and it made Joshua\u2019s palms sweaty1. Agareth mumbled something about uglier noblewomen he\u2019d met, suggesting he thought the same as Joshua.\u201cAh, you\u2014!\u201d Agareth\u2019s finger stabbed at Icarus. \u201cCommoner! The only one!\u201dThe Imperial Academy was famous enough that even foreign nobles and the royalty of minor countries traveled to attend the Academy. It wasn\u2019t exclusive to the nobility but essentially was, in practice. The Academy didn\u2019t treat commoners\u2019 applications poorly, however; there were special exceptions.Notably, Icarus. He was the one and only commoner currently attending the Imperial Academy\u2014actually, he wasn\u2019t a commoner anymore. He comes from Habest Estate, in the Southern part of the Empire. The childless baron and baroness there noticed his brilliance and adopted him so his talents wouldn\u2019t go to waste.Avalon\u2019s nobles had an excessive pride, even compared to other countries, so the baron\u2019s neighbors heavily mocked him for this uncommon happening. Of course, the baron didn\u2019t pay them any mind\u2014he had no desire for power, nor did he have the power to shut their mouths. And so, Icarus garnered some small fame.\u201cHello?\u201d Icarus grinned shyly and bobbed his head as if he\u2019d anticipated the shocked reaction. \u201cI\u2026 I never expected I\u2019d share a room with Young Master Agareth. I don\u2019t know if this is good or not.\u201d\u201cHaha! I\u2019m in the same boat as you\u2026 but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s going to be a great year?\u201d Agareth laughed heartily.\u201cI had a feeling beforehand, but Young Master Agareth seems like a talkative, happy-go-lucky sort of person.\u201d\u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d The subtle sarcasm in Icarus\u2019s voice seemed to fly over Agareth\u2019s head.Joshua felt strangely excluded.\u00a0Aren\u2019t they talking like they\u2019ve known each other for a long time?\u00a0He scowled. They were definitely as new to the Academy as he was, but there wasn\u2019t a hint of unfamiliarity coming off them.There was an anecdote about Icarus that Joshua remembered very well. The low-born Icarus was a perfect victim for the bored noble brats\u2014they just couldn\u2019t leave him alone. Icarus\u2019s life in the Academy was a living hell. Regardless of his abilities, Icarus was the perfect target for their contempt and disdain.This is the first I\u2019ve heard of Icarus having a friend.\u00a0In that nightmare, the first person to reach out to Icarus was none other than Kaiser von Britten, the Fourth Prince.\u00a0He was the first to treat Icarus like a human being. Kaiser discovered a diamond in the rough and gave him the chance to grow as his heart desired.\u00a0Icarus was devoted to Prince Kaiser.However, until then\u2026\u00a0Joshua eyed the boy suspiciously.\u00a0We\u2019ll see soon. Icarus is a one-of-a-kind talent I can\u2019t let get away.He and Icarus had a lot in common: they were taken away from disdain and contempt only to die at the hands of Kaiser von Britten. In Joshua\u2019s eyes, Icarus was already a friend; the enemy of your enemy is a friend, after all. This friend happened to be glowing with talent.Let\u2019s take our time and enjoy it. There will be an abundance of opportunities in the future.\u00a0Joshua watched Agareth and Icarus with sparkling eyes. He was convinced that their meeting was ordained by fate. Over a thousand cadets enrolled every year, and the three of them had ended up as roommates. How could anyone believe it was just a coincidence?My trusted friend turned out to be my enemy\u2014but was fate on my side?\u00a0Joshua\u2019s lips curled into a gentle smile.But Joshua didn\u2019t know that fate was a fickle mistress.\u201cCan you tell me what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\u201cDu-Duke!\u201d Lucia jumped like a startled rabbit and spun around to face the Duke. \u201cMy humble self greets you, my Duke.\u201dDuke Agnus gazed at Lucia with clouded eyes for a long minute.\u201cAre you enjoying your stay?\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks to the Duke\u2019s thoughtfulness, I am living a humble but good life.\u201d Lucia bowed her head respectfully.The Duke eyed her with obvious interest. He seemed to contemplate something and then sighed. \u201cIf you find anything uncomfortable, please feel free to let me know. I\u2019ll let everyone know you can approach me at any time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Lucia fidgeted.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Duke Agnus turned around without giving Lucia an opportunity to speak.\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d The middle-aged man accompanying the Duke bowed to Lucia and then hurried after Duke Agnus.Lucia finally came to her wits and hurriedly bowed to Duke Agnus\u2019s distant back.\u00a0I hope he\u2019s not upset that my bow was late.The man walking beside Duke Agnus cautiously broached the silence. \u201cDuke\u2026\u201dDuke Agnus cast a sidelong glance at him without stopping. He had a moustache but a completely bald head. The man\u2019s name was Baron Hed, one of Duke Agnus\u2019s few true vassals and the long-time manager of the family\u2019s administration. He was also Duke Agnus\u2019s personal secretary in the capital, and he rarely offered advice.Baron Hed resolved himself and gave Duke Agnus a questioning look. \u201cIt may be pretentious of me to ask, but\u2026 May I inquire as to why Lady Lucia was brought into the mansion? I\u2019d heard you\u2019d made a wager with Young Master Joshua. However\u2026\u201d Hed seemed a little frightened. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that Duchess Vaness would be jealous.\u201dDuke Agnus offered him no reply.\u201cYoung Master Babel has been the designated heir for a long time now. Even the vassals are perplexed by the current state of affairs. I\u2019ve heard that Young Master Joshua is incredibly skilled, but even if he\u2019s stronger, I can\u2019t help but consider Young Master Babel\u2019s royal heritage. I think it\u2019s best you take a firm stance this time and maybe just let Young Master Joshua assist the family in other ways.\u201d\u201cTo put it another way, you\u2019re worried about Joshua\u2019s lineage.\u201dBaron Hed nodded without hesitation. \u201cYes\u2026 Young Master Joshua\u2019s blood cannot be ignored; if Young Master Joshua received the Agnus name, there would be an uproar in and out of the family.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Duke Agnus slowly shook his head. \u201cIf it\u2019s about bloodlines, then\u2026\u201d\u201c...Yes?\u201d The Baron tilted his head inquisitively.\u201c...No. For the time being, let\u2019s keep an eye on it.\u201d\u201cYes. As the Master wills.\u201dThe legitimacy of blood\u2026\u00a0A strange light shone behind Duke Agnus\u2019s eyes.Mom\u2019s spaghetti\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It turned out the two of them were already well-known in the Academy. Not in the positive sense, of course. Sometimes, people are more famous for their mistakes than their achievements.The afternoon after the admission ceremony, everyone was called to the canteen. When Joshua and the other two had arrived, the dining hall was already bustling. It was like an enormous restaurant, brimming with luxurious decorations and expensive foods. The dining hall was designed to accommodate every student in the Academy, allowing cadets from all classes to mingle and socialize.I would have assigned a different time for each class if I were the manager\u2026 This place is luxurious, but God, is it cramped.The students already in the hall turned to look at the first-year students who\u2019d just arrived.\u201cLook over there\u2026 are Agareth and Icarus a couple?\u201d\u201cWhat are they doing, teasing each other? Pfft.\u201d\u201cYou know, I heard they share the same room.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Academy do that on purpose? They must have lumped them together because they\u2019re the only two fools who got stuck in freshman year.\u201d\u201cAre they worried that their stupidity will spread to the other students?\u201dThe students\u2019 shameless laughter made Joshua grimace, but he was starting to understand Icarus\u2019s relationship with Agareth.The Imperial Academy had six grades; each grade had to pass a promotion exam to move up. Fail twice, and you would be expelled.I don\u2019t get what they\u2019re talking about. Heaven\u2019s Mind, failing the exam? What the hell happened?While Joshua was engrossed in his thoughts, three cadets blocked his way. They looked intimidating, but Joshua didn\u2019t notice them at first. The boys wore yellow neckties, indicating that they had just started their sophomore year. According to their grade, the color went from white to yellow to green to blue to red to black.\u201cWhat kinda team is this? The illegitimate son of Count Douglas and a commoner!\u201dIllegitimate son?\u00a0Joshua grimaced. His life wasn\u2019t getting any easier.Only two students failed to advance grades. One was a commoner, who was bound to draw attention by virtue of his background; the other was a child born out of an adulterous relationship whose family refused to acknowledge him. Whether Joshua liked it or not, he was stuck with them.Why was it so much trouble for him to avoid attracting attention?Damn it\u2026 Even if they act like shit, the ones who look good get applauded, and the others get laughed at.Joshua\u2019s face contorted. He couldn\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t know anything because he\u2019d already decided to bring Icarus to his side. In other words, he had to put up with the scorn of the people around them.I don\u2019t care for it; I\u2019ve dealt with plenty of this in my last life.\u00a0Joshua was not worried about dealing with this in the slightest.\u00a0Should I just beat the crap out of them?While Joshua\u2019s thoughts were spiraling out of control, Agarareth responded with a foolish smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s because we\u2019re friends?\u201d\u201cFriends? Hah!\u201d\u201cTwo losers sharing a room. Are you two in love?\u201dThe two boys on either side laughed heartily, but the boy in the middle turned his slit-like eyes onto Agareth\u2019s face. \u201cNow, what you just said\u2026 that\u2019s not funny, Agareth kun Douglas. Aren\u2019t your parents ashamed to have you as their child?\u201d The thin-eyed boy turned away scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019re trash, and you always will be. I\u2019m embarrassed to have been a friend of yours.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little excessive, Young Master Amaru?\u201dAmaru halted.\u201cHow dare you, idiot?\u201d The boy on the right stepped towards them as Amaru growled. \u201cHow dare this worthless peasant show such disrespect to the heir of Sten!?\u201dSten? Ah, come to think of it, he looks a lot like his father.\u00a0They had the same gray hair and narrow eyes.Count Arie bron Sten was one of only five of the Empire\u2019s Masters. He was known as the Rapier Master and the Conductor of the Battlefield. The way he wielded his narrow rapier was an art form in itself; those who witnessed it are said to be enthralled by its beauty. His opponents claim to see the supernatural in his blade.The rapier was lighter than the traditional long sword, and widely considered a weapon for women. However, no one who underestimated Count Sten lived to tell the tale. His technique was known as \u201cAlteration\u201d, a style that truly conveys the feeling of change. In his past life, Joshua saw Count Sten and his rapier sweep across the battlefield.\u201cAn insult to my friend is an insult to me! How dare you interrupt him\u2014you ought to be punished!\u201dWhat a load of\u00a0bullshit!\u00a0Icarus bit his lip, managing to stop himself before he yelled something foolish.The other cadets crowded around them, jostling each other to get a good look.\u201cWhat?\u201d Duncan1\u00a0sported a twisted smile as he watched Icarus bite his lip. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with what I said?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything that could possibly offend you or your crew! What exactly are you implying?\u201d\u201cYou have no idea?\u201d Duncan\u2019s grin deepened. \u201cYou lowly bastard tried to stick his head into other peoples\u2019 business and tried to butt into a conversation you don\u2019t belong to\u2026 And this,\u201d Duncan sniffed the air. \u201cYou\u2019re breathing the same air as we are. How absurd is that?\u201cWhat else would it be but an insult?\u201cHumans raise cattle to slaughter them for food. That\u2019s what you are to us. How could we not be enraged when our livestock wants to compete with a human?\u201d\u201cYou\u2014!\u201d Icarus\u2019s cool demeanor cracked. The insult to himself and his parents was too much for him.The mockery of the surrounding students was like salt on his wound:\u201cHahahaha.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026 To be honest, it\u2019s just too much. We\u2019ve been forced to take classes alongside a commoner since last year\u2014a piece of shit.\u201d\u201cDid you think you actually became a nobleman because you got adopted by some random baron?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of the baron who adopted him.Duncan\u2019s delight grew with every comment.\u201cAmaru! Isn\u2019t this too far?!\u201d Agareth clenched his teeth. Even his happy-go-lucky attitude couldn\u2019t cope with this situation.\u201cBefore you say that, why don\u2019t you take a good look at yourself? You have a great time together; you even look good together. Is it true? Are you lovers now?\u201dAgareth\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhether you believe it or not\u2026 Icarus and I are friends.\u201dMy plan to remain anonymous was utterly flawed.\u00a0Joshua sighed.\u00a0It can\u2019t be helped. People are already paying attention to me because I\u2019m next to people who stand out.\u00a0He would\u2019ve preferred to grab Icarus later if he\u2019d known this would happen.Joshua was furious, though he didn\u2019t show it. His lifestyle wasn\u2019t any different from the one they were insulting. His life in the stables\u2026 They treat people the same way they treat livestock.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just Duke Agnus\u2014all the nobility on the continent treated peasants the same. It may be stereotyping, but it was the truth. Aristocrats\u2019 lust for power made them blind to the importance of diversity; they\u2019d trample their subordinates for any advantage they could get.It feels like I\u2019m interfering in children\u2019s arguments, but\u2026\u00a0Joshua stepped forward with a smile plastered on his lips.\u00a0They\u2019re all the same\u2026 so I\u2019ll wipe them all out.As Joshua opened his lips for the first time\u2014\u201cPrin-Prince?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Prince!\u201d\u201cMy word, why is he here?\u201dThe back of the audience erupted into noise. A brilliant boy with blonde hair and golden eyes, the iconic features of the Imperial Family, emerged from the other side of the room. As a prince, he had at least three knights wherever he went, even in a place like this.The golden child approached Joshua and flashed him a dazzling smile. \u201cI see you did it.\u201dJoshua visibly stiffened, in contrast to the golden-eyed boy\u2019s thrilled expression. The enormous dining hall went dead silent as he arrived.\u201cKaiser von Britten,\u201d Joshua muttered.\u201cThe boy on the right\u201d. The author really just dropped his name without an introduction, so we know nothing about him\u2026 but you can probably assume his hair is the same color as his eyes.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I mean\u2026 Yes, the Prince went out of his way to approach Ash first.\u201dWhen Veron shen Villas heard what had happened, he threw a tantrum.\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Veron yelled and shook. \u201cTell me every detail!\u201d\u201cRegarding that\u2026\u201d Muker recounted what he\u2019d heard. Ash pen Frederick was roommates with the two failed students from Veron\u2019s class when Veron wore a yellow tie instead of a red tie. He couldn\u2019t believe that Ash was accepted into the prestigious Academy to begin with. And then Ash and Prince Kaiser met up\u2026?Veron\u2019s face twisted and turned as Muker spoke, ultimately settling into a savage grin.\u201cWhat\u2026 is that it?\u201d he asked.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, yes.\u201d\u201cAre you deaf? Didn\u2019t you just say he knows the Fourth Prince? What happened after that? Did they talk?\u201dMuker smiled sardonically. His master had been jittery ever since that incident.It\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t toss me away.\u00a0Nothing was more disgraceful for a knight than to be abandoned by his master.Once chosen, it was a knight\u2019s duty to protect their master with his life. In Avalon, backtracking on your beliefs was unthinkable, but Muker had to consider what would happen if his Master threw him away in the middle of this chaos.\u201cYes. The Prince supposedly whispered something in his ear, although it was only a brief moment\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it? Useless bastard.\u201d\u201cMy sincerest apologies.\u201d Muker bowed his head, despite being entirely faultless. Veron gave him a disgruntled glance and then spun around.\u201cThat bug got the chance to meet the Fourth Prince? There\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d Veron smirked. \u201cNo matter how hard I looked, I couldn\u2019t find anyone named Viscount Frederick. Now I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s either a fallen aristocrat or a foreigner\u2026\u201dThe plot thickened the more Veron thought about it. It was clear that Ash was not a fallen noble\u2014no mere fallen nobleman\u2019s child would be able to meet the noblest blood in the Empire. So the only possibility left was\u2026A nobleman from another country. In addition, a family with close ties to the prince.\u00a0Veron was dumbfounded.The sons of many noble houses, including the 5 Dukes and the Twelve Families, spun through Veron\u2019s mind.\u00a0I hate to admit it, but I\u2019ve never heard of a nobleman in my own country with such remarkable skills as that age.\u201cAsh pen Frederick\u2026\u201d Veron grit his teeth.I was over the moon when I heard he\u2019d been accepted into the Academy.\u00a0At the very least, there were endless ways Veron would be able to bully him.However, there was an unexpected variable: the biggest variable you could possibly think of, the Prince.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Veron stared down at his hands. It was Ash\u2019s fault that the family Deon Ring hurt to wear on his finger.Veron made a quick decision. \u201cMuker!\u201d\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d he replied.\u201cFor the time being, send a request to the Moon Gate.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of request\u2026?\u201d\u201cAsk them to find out where that damnable Frederick family crawled out of, even if they have to comb the entire continent.\u201d Veron\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cAnd, in case you didn\u2019t realize, I also want them to tell me everything there is to know about Ash pen Frederick himself, the bastard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Muker bit his lip. \u201cMaster, it may be a foolish suggestion, but if you break your pledge now, the entire Villas Estate will lay the blame on you.\u201dVeron glared murderously at Muker, but the knight didn\u2019t avert his gaze. He knew the gravity of the vow he\u2019d made for his family. Ash had imposed a request on Veron via Muker, who\u2019d come in place of Baron Provalum, who\u2019d come in place of Veron himself.\u201cThe ring will be returned\u2026 But, on behalf of your master, apologize and pledge to the Rebrecca family to never stoop to such low behavior again.\u201dThat Ash pen Frederick\u2026\u00a0Muker scowled. He couldn\u2019t get the boy\u2019s name out of his head.Regardless, Count Rebrecca had been there as a notary to ensure that Veron kept his promise.\u201cMy pledge?\u201d Veron shot a fishy smile at Muker. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? What does a promise you made with them have to do with me?\u201dMuker\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMy lord\u2014!\u201d\u201cSuch flimsy pledges are made to be broken,\u201d Veron spat. \u201cShut your mouth and get to the Moon Gate. Incompetent fools like you should just listen like an obedient dog.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Muker\u2019s nails dug into his palm.\u201cWhat? Why are you still here? Shoo. Useless scum.\u201dIt\u2019d been a few days since the welcoming ceremony. Unlike Agareth, who\u2019d been sleeping on his stomach since morning, or Icarus, who focused on class with glittering eyes, Joshua was occupied with thoughts totally unrelated to class.\u201cI received your response\u2026 But, Young Master, I couldn\u2019t give up on you. Do you know why?\u201dThe memory of Kaiser\u2019s face brought a sharp smile to his face.\u00a0Now I know every bit of his personality.How many teeth did he hide behind that pretentious mask?He requested I visit the Imperial Palace at least once before I graduated, but I was planning on it even if he hadn\u2019t asked.\u00a0The Imperial Knights\u2026 That place held a lot of memories. Joshua needed something from there.\u201cAgareth kun Douglas!\u201d Joshua\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by the middle-aged instructor\u2019s irate voice. Even though he was over fifty years old and had a powerful figure, he frowned like a kid.Since Joshua, Agareth, and Icarus were roommates, they were in the same class. The Academy\u2019s primary curriculum was discovering the cadets\u2019 aptitude, but that wouldn\u2019t happen until their third year. Right now, all the first years took the same classes, regardless of their chosen department. Naturally, as the Empire of Knights, that meant everyone took swordsmanship classes.Time for some swordplay.The first, second, and third grades\u2014the underclassmen\u2014took their swordsmanship class together. The Academy was worried that only fighting opponents of a similar level would twist their perception of real war.Icarus was so focused on the course that he hadn\u2019t noticed Agareth falling asleep. Now, he urgently shook the other boy awake.\u201cAgareth! Young Master Agareth!\u201d\u201cUh? Is it already time for dinner?\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201d A few students giggled as they watched Agareth stagger to his feet and wipe the drool off his chin. Their surroundings grew noisy with chatter.\u201cWhat a turd.\u201d\u201cWhat is he doing? Idiot.\u201d\u201cHow did the Douglas family produce such a moron?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a bastard.\u201d\u201cAgareth kun Douglas, concentrate on your class,\u201d the swordsmanship instructor chastised. \u201cUnless you want to be sent home.\u201d\u201cOh, yes! I\u2019m going to concentrate!\u201d Agareth stared forward with his eyes wide open.The instructor shook his head. \u201cNow, let us continue. The sword is frequently referred to as the king of weapons and the master of death. It is the most powerful weapon in the world. That is why most knights prefer it in battle.\u201dThe commotion faded as the instructor resumed his lecture.\u201cThe present emperor, who attained the highest level of mastery while also governing the entire Empire, and one of the Nine Stars, the Empire\u2019s pride, Duke Aden von Agnus, both wield swords. The five Masters of Avalon are the same.\u201cSo, why is the sword said to be the best weapon?\u201dOne of the students quietly raised their hand.\u201cAh, yes.\u201d The instructor nodded and pointed at him to speak. \u201cAmaru bron Sten. I\u2019m looking forward to your answer.\u201dAmaru stood up.\u00a0My father is one of the Empire\u2019s most powerful swordsmen\u2014of course he expected me to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Every weapon except the sword is junk.\u201dJoshua had lost interest in the class, but Amaru\u2019s response made his eyebrows twitch.\u201cAll weapons except swords are worthless\u2014\u201d\u201cYes, no weapon can beat the sword at the same level of skill. I don\u2019t deny that, but your remarks are obviously flawed, Amaru bron Sten.\u201d The instructor shook his head. \u201cMost soldiers are equipped with spears, not swords; this is true in any country. Avalon outfits its soldiers with spears, as well\u2014are you suggesting we teach them swordsmanship instead?\u201dAmaru shook his head and continued without hesitation. \u201cWhat I said pertains to people with similar abilities. Disposable soldiers are not included,\u201d Amaru said with pride.Amaru, a noble to the bone, had been raised to think of spearmen as disposable assets. Most of the cadets nodded along. The common soldier meant as little to Avalon\u2019s aristocrats as sheep.\u201cThe ignorant will overlook the terrain\u2026 Those sorts of people are too blind to dodge a weapon, nor do they have the ability to do so. However, trained knights are different. Distance? It\u2019s not an issue with a sword, but a spear? Its length is difficult to move. So long as you attack quickly, it\u2019s an effortless victory.\u201cWars aren\u2019t limited to the plains, either. A sword isn\u2019t affected by its surroundings, such as mountainous terrain or cramped environments.\u201d Amaru vigorously powered forwards, taking the instructor\u2019s continued silence as a license to continue.\u201cI may have been exaggerating a little, but I believe the swords is the finest\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hilarious.\u201d A voice from the corner stopped Amaru in his tracks. It took him a moment to find the source of the voice, and it confused him.Wasn\u2019t that the boy who hung out with those two louts?\u201cAre all weapons useless except the sword?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the sword is\u201dJoshua cut him off. \u201cThe sword is, in my opinion, the greatest piece of rubbish ever made...\u201cEspecially\u00a0those rapiers the girls use.\u201dWhat did he say?\u00a0Amaru was stunned.\u00a0I misheard, right?\u00a0Amaru\u2019s mouth flapped wordlessly.\u201cRapier\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was no exaggeration to say that their family\u2019s status rode entirely on the shoulders of Count Arie bron Sten.Amaru made it well known how proud he was to inherit the Sten legacy.\u201cDid you\u2026 just say something? Just now?\u201dJoshua met Amaru\u2019s gaze with a politely blank expression. \u201cI said, \u2018The rapier is the greatest piece of rubbish ever made\u2026 and only girls use it.\u2019\u201dThe cadets exploded.\u201cThis\u2014! This dumbass\u2014!\u201dThe second and third years were especially noisy.\u201cWho is he? He must be a freshman, because this is the first time I\u2019ve seen him. Do you think he comes from some great family?\u201d\u201cAh, let me in on the talk! Did you hear any rumors that the son of a high-ranked family was coming?\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s he going to do next? Is he completely insane?\u201dKane, the underclassman swordsmanship professor, frowned at Joshua. For a moment, he pondered the idea of Joshua being the son of a powerful lord, but he quickly recalled that there wasn\u2019t a single child on the admission list that sparked his interest. Not a single one came from the upper nobility.\u201cYou said\u2026 the rapier is a piece of garbage\u2026?\u201dAmaru leapt from his seat.\u201cYOU DARE\u2014\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Kane brought his foot down. \u201cFighting amongst cadets is strictly forbidden!\u201dAmaru tensed.\u201cI\u2019m a proud member of the Sten family! Are you telling me to stand idle while our name is insulted?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Kane trailed off. He knew that the blue-haired boy\u2019s words were blatantly insulting. With Amaru\u2019s pride, Ash\u2019s opinions were like a gut punch.\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d Joshua said. He snorted and grinned cruelly.\u201cWait\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy are you insulting the weapons you don\u2019t use and only put the ones you do use in the spotlight? Isn\u2019t this textbook asshole behavior?\u201d\u201cThis motherfucker!\u201d Amaru\u2019s face flushed scarlet, like his head could pop at any moment. \u201cI\u2019m just telling it like it is!\u201d\u201c\u2018Like it is\u2019? Let me repeat what you said: \u2018All weapons besides swords are useless\u2019. Is that right?\u201d\u201cYes! The Masters, the country\u2019s heroes, except barbarians like the Mercenary King, use swords.\u201dJoshua lips twisted into a lopsided grin. In his first life, he\u2019d come to despise this mentality. These stereotypes were deeply entrenched in these people\u2019s brains, like the roots of an old tree.I could tell just by looking at the instructor\u2014the man didn\u2019t even blink at what Amaru said.Joshua\u2019 twisted smile stretched wider.\u00a0How much scorn did I receive just because I wielded a spear?The spear was a symbol of bravery, selflessness, and righteousness.\u00a0I tried to show that to the rest of the world, and all I got was scorn and contempt. But this life, I\u2019ll show you.\u201cFighting between cadets is strictly prohibited.\u201dAmaru froze awkwardly, but a snide smile quickly found its way onto his lips.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to quote the rules now like you didn\u2019t want to punch me a second ago?\u201dThe other cadets chuckled.\u201cBut.\u201d Joshua stood and faced Kane. \u201cIf it\u2019s for practical training, it wouldn\u2019t break any rules.\u201dKane flinched.\u201cYou want a real fight\u2026\u201d Amaru pondered it and then nodded enthusiastically. \u201cA practice class is scheduled for tomorrow.\u201cExcuse me, Instructor. Please give me a chance to prove to my classmates that I\u2019m not a liar. If you approve this sparring session, I won\u2019t argue anymore.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Kane sighed deeply.Regardless of the students\u2019 backgrounds, the teachers always overruled them within the Academy. It\u2019s how they ensured equality. Kane wasn\u2019t easily fazed, either, but, given the circumstances, he couldn\u2019t turn Amaru down. There was a distinct possibility that the issue would spiral out of control if he left it alone.It\u2019s going to be a long year.\u201cFine. The sword, however, is prohibited for sparring. You may use the wooden sparring weapons in the Academy storehouse; anything else, I will not allow.\u201dAmaru\u2019s face brightened. A wooden sword was perfect for breaking limbs.I\u2019m going to crush you.At the time, no one knew that this incident would permanently change the teaching of swordsmanship in the Academy.Jero had been using the Arcadia branch\u2019s secret room frequently lately. Many wealthy clients visited the Moon Gate in recent years, and they all wanted something big and flashy.Maybe I have too much daily clothing.\u00a0Jero scratched his head absently.An expressionless man sat in the chair across from him. Jero didn\u2019t know the knight\u2019s identity, but the family he came from could not be overlooked\u2014his armor was embossed with the shield-and\u2013sword motif of the Marquis of Villas.I don\u2019t think the Marquis has been involved in any particularly troubling instances recently\u2026\u00a0Jero was skeptical, though. Wouldn\u2019t it be an issue if everything ran\u00a0too\u00a0smoothly?\u00a0Well, I\u2019ll find out if I just ask him.\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to meet a knight of the illustrious Marquis of Villas. I am Jero, an informant.\u201d\u201cMuker.\u201dThe brusque greeting made Jero hesitate, but he didn\u2019t let it show. Only a newbie would allow the client to see their emotions.\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Sir Muker. So, how did you come across our branch\u2026?\u201d Jero went straight to the point, knowing that these kinds of people didn\u2019t appreciate circling the topic.\u201cI\u2019d like you to find everything on one boy\u2026 or person.\u201d\u201cRegarding this\u2026 boy\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a young man named Ash pen Frederick. At this time, he\u2019s enrolled in the Imperial Academy.\u201d\u201cAsh pen Frederick?\u201d Jero cocked his head.\u201cWhile I\u2019m at the Academy, I\u2019ll go by \u2018Ash pen Frederick\u2019. Find me there if more information comes in.\u201d\u201cMy word\u2014!\u201d\u201cDo you have any idea about his origins?\u201d\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Jero smiled. \u201cI know, roughly.\u201dMuker\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cTell me everything there is to know about the boy. I\u2019ll pay you as much as you want.\u201dJero appeared to contemplate something.\u201cAs you are aware, the information our organization handles is quite costly.\u201d The informant smiled sweetly.\u201cIf it\u2019s about money\u2014\u201d\u201cEspecially!\u201d Jero cut Muker off. \u201cEspecially if it falls under our organization\u2019s unique management.\u201d\u201cDo you have to take extra precautions?\u201dThere\u2019s something about that kid. I knew it!\u00a0He couldn\u2019t be ordinary if a vast organization like the Moon Gate put him under special management.\u00a0I expected it but actually hearing it is like being struck by lightning.\u201cTell me. I\u2019ll pay as much as you want\u2014\u201d\u201cOne\u2026 million pieces of gold.\u201d\u201c...What?\u201d Muker stared blankly at Jero.\u201cAsh pen Frederick\u2019s information is worth one million gold.\u201d Jero emphasized each words to make sure Muker didn\u2019t hear anything wrong.\u201cThe Moon Gate will not accept this request unless you can pay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A million gold pieces\u2026 A single communication crystal costs a thousand pieces of gold; a rural castle was similarly priced. A million gold pieces were far more than the annual revenue of a major city.Even if the Marquis of Villas himself had come instead of his vassal, he would\u2019ve left empty-handed.Of course, there was a rational reason for that price.He claimed that his goal was to graduate without drawing any attention. But, given his conflict with Villas\u2019s heir and an unexpected meeting with the Fourth Prince, he\u2019s drawn huge amounts of attention.The Moon Gate\u2019s eyes missed nothing.The Veron shen Villas I know would come for vengeance no matter how hard he\u2019s beaten\u2026 People like him will look for the information they want from other sources if they can\u2019t get it from us.The Moon Gate was the most powerful among its peers, but it had many competitors. If not, the Moon Gate would already control the entire Igrant Continent. As the saying goes, whoever controls the information controls the world.Jeor grinned. Veron shen Villas would be better off keeping his head down. Despite Joshua\u2019s youth, his exceptional abilities and his relationship with the Fourth Prince proved that he was a formidable opponent. Even Veron was beginning to realize that.When doubt becomes certainty, I\u2019m confident that Veron shen Villas will abandon his petty revenge and make a run for it. He\u2019s the sort of person that acts weak to the strong, and strong to the weak.Jero stared idly at the entrance as if he didn\u2019t have a mountain of work piling up.\u201c...Will he find the red coin and finally put an end to this war?\u201d\u201cThat was a risky move.\u201dThose were the first words Agareth said to Joshua when he returned to their room after class. Agareth\u2019s feckless smile was gone for the first time, replaced by a serious expression.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDo you really not know? It\u2019s insane for you to dismiss the rapier in front of the second son of the Sten family!\u201d\u201cI know what I did.\u201dAgareth clutched the back of his neck and groaned while Icarus whispered comforting words to him.\u201cI thought your free-spirited soul would never shoulder these kinds of problems.\u201d Joshua snickered. \u201cTurns out, you pay attention sometimes, too.\u201d\u201cThis guy\u2026\u201d Agareth mumbled some kind of calming mantra under his breath. \u201cAmaru always holds a grudge. You hurt his pride. Expect revenge\u2026 He\u2019s going to try to hurt you badly.\u201cCan you tell me about your abilities? We\u2019re all in the same age group, but he can already feel his mana. It\u2019s a skill that only a few students can do. It might be basic, but it\u2019s a milestone; he really is a Sten\u2014\u201d\u201cYou seem to know a lot about Amaru bron Sten.\u201dAgareth took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI knew him pretty well since we were friends for a long time.\u201dThe past-tense phrasing made Joshua pause.\u201cThe nobility knows that the heads of Sten and Douglas are intimate friends,\u201d Icarus offered.In the far north of the Empire, the Sten and Douglas families had no choice but to rely on each other. The two families bordered Lemegeton, the \u201cDeathland\u201d. Agareth\u2019s father assisted the Sten head, the commander of the north. The two had been exterminating the demons flooding in from the north for a long time.\u201cWhat, is that it?\u201dAgareth nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s something Amaru and I have in common. Both of us are the younger brothers of a skilled older sibling.\u201dJoshua nodded silently.\u00a0I didn\u2019t need to hear the backstory to understand his situation.\u00a0They were in similar circumstances. Agareth was a bastard like Joshua if not treated quite as poorly.\u00a0Like any other family, the eldest son must have pushed him into a corner\u2014and unlike the Agnus duchy, the northern regions are a constant battleground. They wouldn\u2019t have the time to deal with their family affairs even if they wanted to.\u201cThe second son has no say in family affairs or matters of inheritance,\u201d Agareth continued. \u201cAnyways, there isn\u2019t much to say about my childhood. Amaru and I got close because of our circumstances.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Icarus heaved a relieved sigh.\u201cIn any case,\u201d Agareth said, donning his foolish grin again, \u201cthis is why I told you that I know Amaru better than anyone else\u2026 So don\u2019t be stubborn and apologize. I don\u2019t want my new friend to break.\u201dJoshua looked Agareth in the eyes and burst out laughing.\u201cWhat are you laughing for?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about your friendship or whatever your game is\u2026 Let me make one thing clear: you think that the weak should apologize to the strong just because they\u2019re strong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cYou must enjoy smiling like an idiot and turning the other cheek.\u201d\u201cAsh! You know Young Master Agareth doesn\u2019t mean it like that. He was just concerned.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s concerned about who? I\u2019m not like that. I don\u2019t like degrading my pride; since I have the skill, let me show them.\u201d Joshua pushed himself to his feet.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to live in someone else\u2019s shadow, fight to change your fate, and don\u2019t waver in your beliefs.\u201dAgareth blankly gaped at Joshua as he walked out the door.A glimmer of something awakening danced behind Agareth\u2019s eyes.In some ways, the Academy was a way to reinforce the Imperial family\u2019s power by holding the house\u2019s successors hostage; thus, the Imperial family managed it very carefully. That meant that the students had no issue going wherever they wanted after class unless someone had gone missing.Joshua went to his private training ground, the tiny mansion on the outskirts of Duke Agnus\u2019s sphere of influence. After Lucia had departed for Duke Agnus\u2019s residence, the place was empty. It was perfect for some quiet meditation.Ah, this is great.\u00a0Joshua nodded to himself as he settled into meditation.Within his body, two tremendous energies were locked in conflict. It felt rather uncomfortable before, but Joshua quickly got used to it. The two powers had become astonishingly stable once a new power was introduced to the mix.Bronto.\u00a0The powerful Primordial Stone could stand toe-to-toe with the other two energies\u2014and maybe even more than that.Joshua could feel something new\u2026 an entirely new realm he\u2019d never seen in his last life. He had no idea how strong it could be.Magic Spear Arts\u2026 Third Stage.\u00a0An all-new triumvirate of divine power, magic power, and Bronto combined with his own mana.Joshua\u2019s eyes snapped open.\u00a0I can do this.He moved his mana gently and delicately at first as if he were handling a baby and gradually led the two conflicting energies out of the corners they\u2019d been pushed into. A subtle, undetected electrical current spread across his body.A vein popped on Joshua\u2019s forehead.\u00a0Just a little more\u2026!Joshua\u2019s body was suddenly pouring with sweat. It dripped off his body into a puddle of viscous liquid like tepid water. The foul stench of it irritated his nose.Divine power and magic are like water and oil. They can\u2019t mix, so let\u2019s not try. Don\u2019t force it\u2026 just let it flow.Joshua delicately guided the two energies using his mana and Bronto, which almost seemed willing to help him. His body swelled and tightened as if it would pop.How much time had passed?It began with Lugia rattling on the floor.Joshua\u2019s body\u00a0transformed. The electrical currents dancing around him sucked into Joshua\u2019s body, and his eyes opened.A thunderous boom shattered the silence, bathing the area in black and white lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it was not meant to be\u2014he was flung against the wall and lost consciousness.There was a bit of a stir in the Academy. In less than a month after the start of the school year, rumors were already flooding the Academy.Count Sten was insulted by a random Viscount\u2019s son!The Count\u2019s second son, Amaru bron Sten, challenged him to a fight to the death. It was only thanks to Professor Cain\u2019s intervention that it was reduced to a spar.Rumors always get blown up to ridiculous proportions, to say nothing about how well-known Amaru bron Sten was in the Academy.The students\u2019 initial reactions to the rumors fell into three categories: astonishment, ridicule, and\u2026 fervor. Life in the Academy was tedious, and the students were stuck there whether they liked it or not; they were locked inside its walls while the teachers hammered the art of war into their heads. A fight between students was a rare break from the monotony, so they flocked to it in droves.But it should have been impossible, as far as they could tell. Family was everything in Avalon; a powerless family quarreling with a high-ranked family was practically suicide. Even a fight between their children would drag in the entire family\u2014thus, the lower household would always bow their head and beg for forgiveness.By what right does this obscure noble\u2019s son disrespect the scion of Count Sten? Who is he to demand such a thing from the son of one of the Empire\u2019s five Masters?\u201cIs it today? The duel?\u201d\u201cDid you say it\u2019s a duel? I thought it was a real fight.\u201d\u201cEh, either way. Is he sick in the head? No one in their right mind would even dare to look at Amaru\u2019s chin.\u201d\u201cWho? What was his name? Puredator or something? Have you heard of it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Frederick, not Puredator. And no, I\u2019ve never heard the name before.\u201dThis spar had been hotly debated all morning.\u201cThis sucks! I\u2019m not gonna see the fight of the century\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 and this class is boring.\u201d\u201cI keep thinking: it\u2019s only been a day or two since we got here. You think this sparring is going to affect graduation?\u201dThe new kids had gotten themselves into a lot of trouble. Willing or not, this issue had to be resolved.\u201cDid he show up?\u201d\u201cYou think he\u2019s gonna run away?\u201d\u201cAnyone would want to run away once they realize they\u2019re up against Amaru bron Sten\u2014but what about his family? Is he willing to leave his family to hang?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dEven if the Frederick boy did show up, the Stens would not tolerate the insult. Their pride would drive them to get revenge, one way or the other.\u201cDamn it, looks like there\u2019s no fight.\u201dThe underclassmen grumbled as they dispersed from the auditorium.The rumored boy, Joshua, took three days to come to his senses.How long has it been?\u00a0Joshua slowly cracked open his stiff eyelids.His face lit up.\u00a0It\u2019s done!\u00a0A sliver of electricity flickered across his eyes as he opened them fully.The air around him vibrated, and his surroundings were tinted black and white\u2014or was it all in his mind?His vision was still a little blurry, but his body felt light as a feather; a tremendous amount of energy filled every muscle. Joshua knew this energy well.Magic Spear Arts, Third Class.\u00a0He could fully control his mana and envelope his weapon in this state. That said, there was a significant difference in mana density depending on the grade of the wielder.He\u2019d beaten an intermediate B-Class Knight before.\u00a0But now everything is different. Imagine the possibilities.\u00a0He had a brand-new power to accompany his mana.Joshua closed his eyes and turned his focus inwards. The weird, lumpy energy, which rejected each other like oil and water, was gone. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but a massive force embraced the strange intertwining of the two energies.This kind of power\u2026\u00a0Joshua clenched his fists. He owed Bronto an awful lot. Who would\u2019ve guessed that the Origin Stone possessed such power?\u201cAh!\u201d It occurred to Joshua that he could use\u00a0that\u00a0at the third level of the Magic Spear. He stretched his hand out and found\u2026 nothing?\u00a0My dear Lugia!\u00a0Where was it, his heart of hearts?[Are you a moron?]Joshua heard a child\u2019s voice from over his shoulder. He spun around to find a long object casually floating in front of him\u2014a glimmering silver rod emitting a strange light.\u201cLugia\u2026?\u201d[Your stupidity is on another level. Why would you sleep for three days where the enemy can attack you on all sides?]\u201cThree days\u2014?\u201d Joshua\u2019s face paled.[Thank and adore the great Lugia! The greatest companion in the world! This body cared for you while you slept dumbly for three days!]\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Lugia\u2019s constant chatter was making it hard for him to think.Something wasn\u2019t right. Joshua had expected Lugia to transform; similar changes had happened in his former life as well.The thing was, each stage of the Magic Spear had distinct qualities. One of these was the 'subspace\u201d, which allowed an artifact to appear and disappear. Lugia had its own subspace magic, a distinguishing trait of the extremely rare ancient artifacts.However, those relics were typically tiny objects like rings and necklaces\u2014there were almost no subspaces that encompassed an entire weapon, especially one as large as Lugia. Even a handful of space took enormous amounts of mana to twist, and generating a subspace required twisting space all the way.Joshua had relished Lugia\u2019s subspace abilities in his first life. In the blood-soaked carnage of the battlefield, Lugia could appear from nowhere and strike at an enemy at any place and at any time. To his enemies, Lugia was like the reaper emerging from hell to drag Joshua\u2019s victims into the underworld.Another one of Lugia\u2019s unique properties was the ability to alter its appearance, as Joshua showed the Duke.I didn\u2019t realize Lugia could change its shape until this life.Joshua was ecstatic that he could disguise Lugia as an iron rod. He was worried that its distinctive shape would draw people\u2019s attention.But this last ability is what puzzles me the most.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s brow furrowed.Lugia can talk. In other words, it had an ego.This happened to me before, shortly after I returned, so I wasn\u2019t surprised. I felt like I was dealing with a serious middle-aged man at the time, but now\u2026[Are you seriously telling me that you think I act like a child?]\u201cLike a child\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes popped when he realized he\u2019d been talking out loud. \u201cWhat was\u2014\u201d[Are you done being surprised? Don\u2019t be a wimp and don\u2019t rely on this weapon that just awakened, okay? Also, I can read minds, if you hadn\u2019t noticed.]Joshua clamped his mouth shut.[Surely you\u2019re not forgetting something important.]\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d[Hahhh\u2026 Worry about yourself before you start worrying about your enemy. Do you know if your body is okay right now or not?]\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d[Want me to tell you something?]\u00a0Lugia pushed up close to him.\u201cYou know something?\u201d[The Stone you got earlier\u2026 You\u2019d be a fool to believe that all it has is an \u201cattribute\u201d.]\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201dLugia seemed to roll its imaginary eyes before it continued.[If you don\u2019t know that, I have to wonder how much research humans have done on the Origin Stones. Its true power is different.]Joshua stared at Lugia.[You want some examples? The Origin Stone Magma has the power of extinction. It will devour everything in its scorching flames. Aqua has \u201cregeneration\u201d, Gaia has \u201charmony\u201d, and so on. In summary, they all have their unique properties. What matters is: what kind of power does Bronto have?]Joshua mulled it over for a while.\u00a0I have the thunder attribute, known for its destructive power, but does it have more than this? No, it must. This stone is clearly on the same level as Ulabis\u2019s red Origin Stone.[Consider your options carefully\u2026 The answer could be very helpful in your situation.]\u00a0Lugia teased him like it had no intention of giving him a straight answer.\u00a0[Remember your plans? The\u00a0revenge?]The sound of Lugia\u2019s voice made his eyes fly wide open.\u201cYou!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the fourth day of class, the boy who\u2019d been absent for three days showed up like nothing had happened.\u201cPlease accept my apologies for being late.\u201dThe cadets erupted into whispers when they saw him enter the classroom.\u201cAsh pen Frederick\u2026\u201d Kane stopped Joshua as he walked in.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNice of you to show up three days after the first day of school. You haven\u2019t been here for that long and you\u2019re already missing content.\u201d\u201cPlease accept my apologies.\u201d Joshua bowed his head with a repentant look until Kane shook his head.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201d Kane gestured for Joshua to raise his head. \u201cHowever, I expect you\u2019re prepared to accept the consequences of your actions? For example, compensation and such.\u201dKane\u2019s voice sounded intimidating at first, but Joshua noticed a tinge of sadness in it as if he was both happy and sad that Joshua had returned. It was like he wanted to know why Joshua hadn\u2019t fled while he had the chance\u2026 but he never put those thoughts into words.Kane took his responsibilities seriously; all of his students were his disciples, and he didn\u2019t want friction between them. His authority as a teacher could curb some of it, despite the students\u2019 aristocratic rank, but he couldn\u2019t solve it just by telling them \u201cNo.\u201d Whether he liked it or not, these children wielded more power than you might think. One wrong move could spell his death.It would have been fine if he just lied low, but\u2026\u00a0Kane sighed and peered towards the corner of the classroom.Amaru had been glaring murderously at Ash the moment he stepped through the door.Kane could only hope that everything went smoothly from now on. Soon, however, his expression firmed.I\u2019ll do my best to protect everyone.\u00a0As always, he absolutely could not allow bad things to happen when he could stop them.\u00a0Haven\u2019t I been successful so far?I need to delay this for as long as I can. Even if it\u2019s only a spar, we\u2019re talking about Amaru here. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if both of them lost control.\u201cPlease take your seat immediately. Class must continue.\u201d\u201cYes, instructor.\u201d Joshua shuffled over to his seat under Kane\u2019s watchful gaze.\u201cNow that everyone\u2019s here, I\u2019ll continue my lecture. The theory I\u2019ll discuss now will show up in the upcoming exam, so I need your eyes and ears on me. Pay attention.\u201dAgareth, seated next to Joshua, leaned over.\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d he muttered.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear? Frederick\u2019s manor is in ruins! And if you did know, does that mean you\u2019re the last of your line?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s relaxed. \u201cThey did their research.\u201d\u00a0They must have numerous connections, as expected of the nobility\u2019s children.\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s been well-publicized among the students. When you didn\u2019t show up for days, Amaru must\u2019ve used his family\u2019s connections to sniff it out. He\u2019s definitely flexing, but he\u2019s just that powerful.\u201cIt\u2019s still not too late. It told you that bending would make everything easier, right? Just take my advice! Instead of living like that, just try lowering yourself a little.\u201dJoshua opened his mouth to reply, but he stopped when he saw the puppy eyes Agareth was giving him\u2014half pitying and half cute. Icarus met Joshua\u2019s eyes from the front row and gave him a similar look.I knew it before they said anything.\u00a0No doubt there was a huge fuss when he disappeared from school.Joshua chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m still going to show you how to stick to your beliefs.\u201d\u201cThis guy really\u2014!\u201d Agareth was fuming next to him, but Joshua had already closed his ears. It was obvious why they were so worried, but Joshua had other things to worry about. His conversation with Lugia had given him a lot to think about.\u201cLugia\u2014\u201d[You must be bursting with questions for me?]\u201cI want to know how you found out about my revenge\u2026 and what are Bronto\u2019s other power? And did you really come back in time with me!?\u201d[No, no, no. I didn\u2019t travel back in time with you. Who are you again? I can\u2019t seem to remember.]\u201cStop joking\u2014\u201d[What a chump. Seriously?]The childish voice rattling inside Joshua\u2019s head made him purse his lips. He wanted to complain but immediately killed the thought when he remembered that Lugia could read his mind. It felt weird to get angry at a voice inside his head, considering it was a\u2026 voice inside his head.[Consider your choices carefully. I\u2019ve got the upper hand here, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be the one with regrets if you turn me down. What are you gonna do if I decide to just shut my mouth and go to sleep? Aren\u2019t you in a hurry? Hmmmmmm? Time is ticking, Joshua.]Joshua sighed. He already knew this was a battle he would lose\u2014he never really had a choice, to begin with.\u201cWhat are your conditions?\u201d[I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming around.]\u00a0Lugia spun cheerfully like it was swimming through the air.\u00a0[It\u2019s no biggie, just\u2026]\u00a0Lugia stopped directly in front of Joshua.\u00a0[Find the connections from your past life and\u2026 take care of yourself a little more. Nothing bad will happen if you value yourself a little higher.]\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Joshua was taken aback. He\u2019d been worried that Lugia, the self-proclaimed demonic spirit, would spout some pompous demands\u2014but \u201cvalue yourself?\u201d Really? The first condition made some sense, but the latter was just absurd. It would\u2019ve been easier to believe if Lugia had told him to dive into the Demon Realm and slay the Demon King.[Are you going to do it or not? Give me an answer already, cause I\u2019m tired! You too, right? You\u2019re busty too, right?]\u201cYou? Tired?\u201d[Are you gonna answer, or do I have to send you back to sleep?]Joshua mulled it over for a while.\u201cDeal.\u201d He nodded. For the time being, there was nothing to be concerned about. Everything was going according to plan, and that was fine by him.[Finally. It took you that long to say one word?]Lugia\u2019s body hummed.[A vow made to a deity like me is a great burden to bear. Try not to forget that.][Do you really, truly believe that Bronto\u2019s power is \u201cforesight?\u201d]Joshua\u2019s face lit up. Of course he did\u2014he\u2019d seen the dream with the burning Agnus manor. He assumed it was because of Bronto\u2019s power.[Sorry\u2026 but you\u2019re obviously wrong. It wasn\u2019t because of Bronto.]\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Joshua scowled. The dream had felt so real that it was difficult to believe Lugia.\u201cI have good memory. The demise of the Agnus house will definitely happen. That wasn\u2019t a dream, it was an oracle.\u201d[I mean\u2026 who doesn\u2019t have a good memory when it comes to bad things? I said it wasn\u2019t Bronto\u2019s power; I didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t a lucid dream.]\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d[That isn\u2019t the point right now. It\u2019s said that when you think about someone or something hard enough, it finds its way into your dreams. In your case, you kept thinking about getting revenge on\u00a0him. That\u2019s why he was there.]Joshua stared blankly at Lugia.[To put it another way, the \u201coracle\u201d you had came from one of the energies in your body: divine power.]\u201cThe divine power?\u201d[Some idiots think that divine power only does things like healing or bringing the dead back to life. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong.]\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d[Literally, the power of God. Have you ever heard of a high priest receiving divine warning of impending danger?]Joshua nodded.[Your dream is something similar. The power of divinity can do things no human can. If you can fully absorb the energies within you\u2026]\u00a0Lugia crackled with electricity.\u00a0[No human can stand in your way.]\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Joshua let out a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2026\u201d He was a little put-off by Lugia\u2019s comments, but he couldn\u2019t linger on it now.\u201cThank you for the story\u2026 Now tell me what Bronto\u2019s real power is.\u201dLugia gently drifted to the ground as if catching its breath.[The Origin Stone, the Gem of the Gods\u2026 Bronto, imbued with the power of lightning, is the fastest and most destructive of them. Its true power is \u201cexpansion.\u201d]\u201cInstructor!\u201d A loud voice from the corner of the classroom interrupted Joshua\u2019s memory. \u201cAre you really going to end the class like this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kane gave Amaru a perplexed look.\u201cInstructor, you approved our fight\u2014and not just any fight. This is for the nobles\u2019 dignity. My family, and\u2026 what\u2019s left of his.\u201d Amaru put on a despondent expression. \u201cIf you\u2019ve changed your mind, I have no choice but to believe that you\u2019re allowing my entire family to be mired in shame.\u201dThis is the opposite of what I was hoping for!\u00a0The hierarchy between students and teachers was only skin-deep; in Avalon, family trumped everything.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you came up with, but if you think I\u2019m just gonna stand around after the shame he brought us, you\u2019re wrong. The stick is the best medicine for a disobedient dog, after all.\u201d\u201cI think this works surprisingly well.\u201d A soft voice sounded from the other side of the classroom. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on walking away.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014\u201d\u201cAfter all\u2026\u201d Joshua paused for a moment and let out a hearty chuckle. \u201cSticks are the best medicine for mad dogs.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It matched his body.I\u2019m more annoyed that they\u2019re ignoring the spear than that they\u2019re ignoring me.\u00a0When he\u2019d become a Master, no one was able to talk shit about the spear. However, he had to deal with their constant criticism and humiliation until then. He\u2019d spent so long ignoring them that it all blurred together.No\u2026 Hearing someone belittle the spear always makes my blood boil, no matter my age.\u201cAsh\u2026 it\u2019s not too late to back out.\u201dJoshua turned to face Icarus.\u201cCould you stop saying that, please?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll be frank.\u201d Icarus\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but you won\u2019t be able to beat Amaru.

You can\u2019t change this place on your own!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d\u201cNo, I mean\u2014\u201d Icarus stared at Joshua and then shook his head. \u201cI apologize, that\u2019s irrelevant. The issue at hand is more important, Young Master Ash.\u201d\u201cYou know what?\u201d Joshua pointed at Icarus. \u201cI enjoy betting\u2026 a lot.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSo let\u2019s make a bet. We\u2019ll bet on this\u2026 craziness, shall we? If I survive this match without a hitch, or unscathed, or whatever you want to call it, then I win.\u201d\u201cYou really\u2014 You want to gamble in this situation!?\u201d\u201cAnd the loser owes the other person a request.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d Icarus eyed him. \u201cFor the record, my goal is to stop you from fighting. Now you\u2019re telling me that you losing is supposed to be a win for me?\u201cThat aside, I already know what I\u2019d ask for if I won the bet\u2014but I\u2019m too afraid to say it.\u201d\u201cI never considered that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLosing.\u201dIcarus gaped at Joshua.\u00a0What the hell does his confidence come from?Icarus wanted to tell Ash that he was about to go down like the Frederick household did, but Icarus knew that Ash wouldn\u2019t take it well.\u201cAh, wouldn\u2019t it be fun?\u201dIcarus whirled around to face the voice coming from the other side of the room.\u201cCan I join in on this wager?\u201d Agareth has abandoned his serious face and sported a manic, ear-to-ear grin.\u201cYoung Master Agareth!\u201d\u201cNo, hear me out, Icarus. There\u2019s no other way out of this. Ash here couldn\u2019t possibly let it go; even if he got an apology, he\u2019s not nice enough to forgive and forget.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2014\u201d\u201cI see you\u2019re still unconvinced. Look at it this way: Amaru wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less than a beatdown no matter how far Ash ran.\u201cAnyways, Instructor Kane will be officiating. Let them break each others\u2019 limbs\u2014maybe we\u2019ll get something good out of our bet.\u201d Amaru turned to face Joshua. \u201c\u2018Course, I\u2019m betting on Amaru.\u201d\u201cWhatever floats your boat.\u201d Joshua flashed him a smile.Swordsmanship practice is typically held at the large gymnasium in the middle of the Academy. At the moment, it was packed with thousands of students eagerly awaiting the fight.\u201cWas your brain working properly? Or did you lose it after you fled?\u201d Amaru smirked at Joshua.Amaru\u2019s voice was loud enough for the audience to hear, to their vocal amusement.\u201cI admire your courage\u2026 You actually came back in this state. But what you said about that \u2018garbage\u2019 weapon is not good, I must say, not good. If you disappear like this\u2026\u201d Amaru looked towards Kane, standing in the middle of the gymnasium, then looked back at Joshua and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant now; go get a real weapon. You\u2019ll hurt yourself if you use the wrong weapon.\u201dJoshua tightened his grip on the stick he was holding rather than responding to Amaru\u2019s taunts. No one could see it, but Joshua was going through a transition. He stared down at his hands, pondering the art of spearmanship and the 3rd-grade Magic Spear Arts he\u2019d recently learned.He knew he could handily overcome anyone\u2019s swordsmanship with his spear alone. Joshua wasn\u2019t being humble\u2014he could beat Amaru with brute force.Once again, I will show the world how great it is to wield the spear.Joshua began to review his fundamentals. Every martial arts style was distinct: Duke Agnus\u2019s swordsmanship hinged on the power of his immense bulk, while the Sten\u2019s style carried a flowing elegance and produced endless variations.Soft beats strong, fast beats soft, heavy beats fast, and strong itself beats strong. Based on this logic, you might think that Count Sten would beat Duke Agnus\u2014but that was nonsense. That battle would be trivial for an Absolute like Duke Agnus.There were few such exceptions, however. The logic held for the vast majority of people, and it was critical for achieving victory. Thus, how should Joshua approach this fight? What kind of technique would counter his opponent?Swift annihilation.Joshua cheerfully hefted his stick. He\u2019d never used it before, but he quite liked the way it looked. It rather resembled his Lugia.Swords were suited to many people, but spears were robust and heavy and generally difficult to wield in battle. The advantage of the spear, however, was its versatility. Until mana became an established resource in Igrant, the lance was a knight\u2019s primary weapon.I\u2019ve always been looking towards the next milestone while I run. But when I get over one wall, there\u2019s always another one a thousand times taller. I can\u2019t stop running.There was no end in sight to this spear. He believed that because he\u2019d mastered the art of magic.I\u2019ve sprinted all the way to the front, hoping to see the finish line, but it\u2019s all turned into poison.Joshua, you idiot. There\u2019s nothing more important than basics and initiative. If I\u2019ve forgotten that, then of course I still have a long way to go.Joshua realized that he\u2019d lost track of the basics after wielding the spear for so long. His memories from his past life were obscuring the path to his future.\u201cPrepare to fight!\u201d Amaru grit his teeth and stomped forward. \u201cDo your best, you fucking bastard.\u201dJoshua stood with his eyes closed as if ignoring Amaru.\u201cIf that\u2019s your wish\u2026 I\u2019ll crush you like this!\u201d Amaru pushed off the ground, rushing forwards. His thin eyes glimmered with a cold light.Joshua\u2019s instincts told him that his opponent was approaching fast. The audience might call it a thunderous speed, but Joshua felt otherwise: it felt like time was passing slower as if one second was stretched into a million. There was a long, painful wait while Amaru approached.Joshua blinked his eyes open expectantly.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking abou\u2014\u201dAmaru\u2019s inquiry was cut short by a bright ray of light striking his abdomen.The gymnasium was held in a peaceful silence while the audience tried to figure out why Amaru\u2019s violent advance had come to a dead halt.\u201cAmaru.\u201d Even Kane couldn\u2019t hide his perplexed expression. \u201cWhat are you do\u2014\u201dAmaru let out a pained scream and collapsed before the disbelieving eyes of the students.Only one person looked happy.Pleasure above pleasure, pleasure beyond pleasure.\u00a0Making the opponent bleed was a pleasure his opponent couldn\u2019t even understand.Joshua\u2019s grip tightened, crushing the stick in his hand.Even in his past life, he\u2019d never attained this skill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Icarus had no idea how great his roommate\u2019s technique was. Icarus opened and closed his eyes, but all he saw was Amaru falling to the ground.He couldn\u2019t even see Ash\u2019s movements properly\u2014no one could. Kane\u2019s dumbfounded expression made that obvious.My calculations have never been wrong before, but I didn\u2019t imagine that Young Master Ash would have such skills. I\u2019m stunned.Icarus watched over Joshua from the top of the stadium. Whether Joshua knew it or not, everything he did meant something to Icarus. An act of courage and arrogance by an untalented person was just that; but the conviction and courage of a powerful person like Ash was a display of talent.However\u2026\u00a0Worry creased Icarus\u2019s face.Something unexpected had occurred, and it was not a good thing. The scion of a great swordsman was defeated by a boy with a spear, of all things. It was a clear insult. Even worse, it happened in front of the children of nobility.Sten would not stand for this humiliation. The next blow might very well come from the family itself.I need to help.\u00a0Icarus\u2019s expression was filled with determination.\u00a0Ash\u2019s next move needs to be carefully planned to prevent something like this from happening again. My tactics can help him.Beside him, Agareth gaped blankly at the center of the gymnasium. Icarus nudged him, but he was unresponsive like he\u2019d passed out. Icarus sighed and turned back to look at Ash.\u201cJoshua von Agnus\u2026\u201dIcarus was startled and turned to face the source of the voice tickling his ear. It came from a girl with ubiquitous brown hair; she wore the same necktie as them, suggesting she was of the same age.Joshua von Agnus\u2026?\u00a0Icarus tilted his head thoughtfully.\u00a0Hmm. Where did I hear that name?He wasn\u2019t familiar with the name, but he\u2019d definitely heard it somewhere. Any name that wasn\u2019t absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel would find its way into every ear in the Empire.What if\u2026 he\u2019s connected to\u00a0that\u00a0family?\u00a0The Agnus Duchy, the most prestigious and one of the biggest gatherings of knights in the Empire, often known as the \u201cKnight\u2019s Family.\u201d Besides Duke Aden von Agnus himself, only one person bore the Agnus name.Icarus gasped.\u00a0The Empire\u2019s treasure, Babel von Agnus.There was another weird rumor bouncing around the Capital: a new talent was discovered that could shatter the status quo.\u00a0The idea terrified Icarus enough that he couldn\u2019t keep it from his expression.No way\u2014!\u00a0Icarus whirled around to look for that curious girl\u2014but she had already vanished, leaving Icarus to mumble to himself.Can I verify it for myself? What if there\u2019s no way?\u00a0Suspicion swelled in Icarus\u2019s heart and spiraled out of control. He\u2019d been so sure that Ash came from a situation not unlike his own; but then Ash had smashed through the Sten family with a single blow\u2014and smashed Icarus\u2019s expectations, too.But the events leading to this moment were too suspicious. Icarus needed to know who this Ash pen Frederick really was.In the meantime, the rest of the audience was coming to their senses. The gymnasium rapidly filled with noise again, but Icarus\u2019s deeply sunken eyes never wavered from their target.The Academy\u2019s dormitories were identical for males and females. They were also both empty\u2014there was quite some time until the students were due to return to their lodgings.The door to a certain room swung open with a creak, allowing a rather ordinary-looking girl to enter.\u201cI thought you would be quiet like a dead mouse\u2026\u201d Anna1, the girl in question, bit her lip. She took a quick glance around the room to make sure she had privacy, then pulled out her communication crystal ball.A device like this was far too valuable for a noble\u2019s child to be carrying on their own. Anna was on a mission, however, and she had to take the risk.By injecting a little bit of mana into the ball, a hologram slowly coalesced on top of the crystal. Anna was surprised when she realized who the fully-formed figure was. The crystal ball wasn\u2019t good enough to show her in detail, but the glossy, dark-brown hair drew her eye.\u201cAh\u2026 I never thought it would be you, father.\u201d[It\u2019s been a long time, Anna.]\u201cWhy did father\u2026\u201dA lovely young man gently waved his hand as Anna settled into her seat.[Indeed, it\u2019s me. How\u2019s the Academy? Are you enjoying it?]\u201cI\u2019m doing well\u2026 but how is father able to communicate with me directly?\u201d Anna\u2019s words caught in her throat and her eyes widened. \u201cIs it\u2026 Are there problems with the Empire?\u201d[Problems with the Empire?]\u00a0The man in the ball erupted into laughter.\u00a0[Thran has been irate recently, but I can\u2019t do anything on my own since I\u2019m merely a Master.]\u201cAh.\u201d The way the man casually spoke about the most powerful position, short of the Emperor himself, made Anna flush. \u201cThen why\u2026?\u201d[Vig beck Steck is dead.]\u201cWhat!? The Viscount is dead? Did you hear it from Duke Agnus? Or did he somehow get tangled up in something that\u2014\u201d[No, that\u2019s not the case.]\u00a0The man shook his head.\u00a0[The Duchy is also in turmoil right now.]\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d[The Seven Magicians.]Anna boggled at the man. \u201cThe Seven Magicians of the Magic Tower did this? What proof do you have?\u201d[It\u2019s said that the Thunderbolt, Jack Steropes, is on the move.]Anna was silent for a moment while she absorbed the unexpected information.\u201cIs the Tower aware of our plans? This is so sudden\u2014they were so arrogant and greedy, so what are they doing now?\u201dThe man nodded.\u00a0[The Magic Tower runs on money. They never move their fat asses unless there\u2019s money involved, and that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re moving now.]\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d[Their movements have nothing to do with our plans. They were silent since Duke Agnus intervened, and judged us as having nothing to do with them. But they have one goal\u2026 to destroy.]\u00a0The man paused for a moment, eyes glittering.[The child you\u2019ve been observing, Joshua von Agnus. It appears he found what the Tower was protecting.]\u201cWhat was it?\u201d[They were keeping the Origins Stones. A stone imbued with the power of an attribute; some say that one was found in the fertile lands of Thran as well.]Anna hesitated. \u201c...Wouldn\u2019t it be huge if\u00a0he\u00a0obtained such a powerful object from the Magic Tower? It\u2019s best we seize it from Joshua von Agnus\u2014\u201d[No. It\u2019s a waste of power.]\u00a0The man shook his head firmly.\u00a0[After all, it\u2019s not like anyone except the Magic Tower could ever use the power of the Stone. Our bloodline, on the other hand, would be immediately wiped out if we were discovered taking interest in such things.]\u201cSorry\u2026 I thought of something useless again.\u201d[As a result of his tendency to attract unexpected variables, your work has become even more crucial.]\u201cI will keep a closer eye on him.\u201d[Did you see him today, as well?]\u201cYes. I have been monitoring him constantly.\u201d[In the future, report to me directly for anything about the boy.]\u201cI will.\u201d Anna took a deep breath. \u201cAs soon as he arrived at the Academy, Joshua von Agnus had an accident.\u201d[Accident?]\u201cHe belittled the rapier, so the second son of Sten challenged him to a duel. Joshua eagerly accepted and then, just earlier, knocked down Amaru bron Sten in front of everyone.\u201d[That\u2019s fantastic.]\u00a0The man\u2019s stiff expression collapsed into laughter.\u00a0[I can\u2019t wait to see how Duke Agnus reacts when he hears about this.]\u00a0The man clapped his hands together.\u201cThis makes me nervous. Monitoring will be difficult if Duke Agnus pulls Joshua back into the household out of fear of a greater incident.\u201d[The Duke getting involved? Well, it\u2019s not impossible\u2026]\u201cIf the Duke starts to have negative ideas, it\u2019ll be difficult for us. The Duchy isn\u2019t a place we have enough intelligence on.\u201d[That isn\u2019t the issue, is it?]\u00a0The man shook his head and smiled widely.\u00a0[I know a terrific man named Duke Agnus who will be thrilled to hear the news. Perhaps that child will take over as the Duke\u2019s official successor.]\u201cIf the succession is flipped, it won\u2019t be pretty\u2014especially since he\u2019s a concubine\u2019s child. Would the Duke really set Babel von Agnus aside? I mean, no matter how much the Duke loves talent\u2026\u201d Anna shook her head; she didn\u2019t believe it would ever happen. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d[He is indeed the humble child of a maid, but\u2014]\u00a0The man grinned inscrutably, to Anna\u2019s consternation.\u00a0[wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if his own child was better off than the others?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You might even call it peaceful.Icarus was deep in his thoughts yesterday and only returned around midnight. Agareth, too, walked out with a shocked expression and didn\u2019t show his face until the next morning. Joshua didn\u2019t get a chance to bring up the bet, even as a joke.However, I have no intention of continuing this charade.\u00a0Joshua sneered.Right now, Joshua was in a rather spartan room: it contained a desk, a chair, a bookcase, and nothing else. Instructor Kane had called Joshua into his study before classes.\u201cAsh pen Frederick. What is your true identity?\u201d Seeing Joshua stay silent, Kane continued. \u201cIt\u2019s best to look through the student roster and other records. The Frederick estate, in the countryside, is now owned by Viscount Hook\u2014it\u2019s the \u201cHook estate\u201d now. It says here that Viscount Frederick suffered financial troubles and barely kept his noble status. Five years ago, he sold his entire estate to Viscount Hook.\u201dKane had probably pulled this information from the \u201cImperial Nobility List\u201d. In certain libraries, a list of Imperial aristocrats were available to everyone who needed them\u2014especially members of the Imperial family. Naturally, it took note of where a family lived.That said, it didn\u2019t go into detail; the risk of the information being exploited by an enemy was too great. Despite the scarce information, Kane had managed to deduce quite a lot.\u201cThe son of the illustrious Sten family was felled in a single strike, by the son of a fallen noble nobody even knew the name of. Even I couldn\u2019t see what you did, or how you did it.\u201d Kane\u2019s experience with swordsmanship extended far beyond the sphere of a B-Class Knight. His sword was known for forcing his peers to fold beneath its crushing weight.\u201cYour identity makes less sense the more I think about it. Viscount Frederick, the head of your family, vanished ages ago; regardless, he was not a well-known Martial Artist. He doesn\u2019t have any reputation for swordsmanship or spearmanship anywhere on the continent.\u201dKane stared at Joshua with narrowed eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you once again. Who are you?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026 Ash pen Frederick.\u201dKane bit back a retort and the two spent a long moment in silence.\u201cSometimes, high-ranking nobles or royals from neighboring countries enroll in the Academy with hidden identities.\u201d Kane\u2019s eyes probed Joshua for a reaction, but Joshua\u2019s expression was unchanging.\u201cAsh pen Frederick.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t give a damn what you think. This situation doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Even as a sparring session between students, it still involves the Sten family. This could have ended much worse. Belittling the Sten swordsmanship in front of the noble children is an entirely separate issue.\u201d\u201cI take full responsibility.\u201dKane gave him a questioning look.\u201cI\u2019ll carry it all.\u201d\u201cYou say you\u2019re gonna take full responsibility\u2026\u201d Kane smiled bitterly. \u201cThere was a guy who felt the same as you, last year. Shimizu kun Douglas was his name.\u201d\u201cDouglas\u2026\u201d The familiar name made Joshua tilt his head.\u201cThe most important thing to remember is that this isn\u2019t a problem you can address on your own. Even among students of the same rank, there\u2019s hierarchy and cliques. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2014family is everything here.\u201cAmaru comes from the Sten family, and that placed him in certain circles before he even arrived at the Academy. They will see this as a challenge.\u201d Kane looked Joshua straight in the eyes. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201cFrom now on, those children will bully children from humble households. That means you. They\u2019re afraid of what you did to Amaru and they\u2019ll worry that they\u2019re next\u2014\u201d\u201cI only have one question,\u201d Joshua interrupted. \u201cSplitting the students into \u2018social classes\u2019, disregarding the abuse and intimidation taking place behind closed doors\u2014is this what a teacher, an adult, does?\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything left to learn from a teacher like you.\u201d Joshua got to his feet. \u201cIf you leave it alone because you\u2019re afraid of the immediate consequences, their behavior never stops. Ever.\u201d\u201cAsh pen Frederick.\u201d Kane addressed Joshua\u2019s departing back. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of things that are impossible to change, no matter how hard you try.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018impossible.\u2019 Not trying is for cowards\u2014and I assure you, I am not one.\u201d Joshua seized the doorknob.\u201cUnless you intend to do something at the Academy\u2026\u201d Joshua halted in the doorframe as Kane spoke. \u201cIf all you want is to complete the compulsory education, then I would advise you to take an easier route. You can join the Imperial Knights, it\u2019s the same as mandatory education. With your strength, the admission test will be easy.\u201dThen I won\u2019t have to waste six years here once I\u2019ve figured out Bronto\u2019s new power.\u00a0Even if he skipped grades, his stay at the Academy would be four years at minimum. On the other hand, the Imperial Knights were bound to serve for ten years. Kaiser\u2019s proposal was long gone\u2014Joshua\u2019s pride would not allow anything else.Of course, it\u2019s not like that\u2019s the only method.\u00a0Joshua recalled the letter he\u2019d sent Kaiser the day before he left the Duchy and chuckled to himself.He often sneered when he thought about Kaiser.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Kane pressed on, assuming that Joshua was thinking it over. \u201cEven if you\u2019re already enrolled in the Academy, you should be able to pass the exam with just a little effort.\u201d\u201cI have no desire to squander my time in a place like this.\u201dKane\u2019s face brightened. \u201cThen\u2014\u201d\u201cBut. I have no wish to flee like that. I\u2019m not afraid of anything. Excuse me.\u201d Joshua bowed his head slightly and walked out the door.Kane stared at the empty doorway.\u201cI\u2019m a coward\u2026\u201d Kane stared at the warm sunlight streaming through the window. \u201cWould you agree, Shimizu?\u201d\u201cThe warp gate is so useful.\u201d The man who just exited the warp gate took a look around. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Arcadia! Ah\u2026 Actually, it\u2019s been a couple of years.\u201d\u201cHic!\u201d A young man dressed in a brown wizard\u2019s robe hiccuped, drawing the man\u2019s attention.This is insane.\u00a0Shawn, the young wizard in charge of the warp gate, snorted to himself and looked away. He was amazed by what he was seeing.The Magic Tower controls all the warp gates on the continent. It was one of the Tower\u2019s most important assets, and it certainly enforced the Magic Tower\u2019s influence on the continent. Avalon\u2019s knights were just as cautious of the wizards as the wizards were cautious about them.Shawn was struck by a wave of dizziness and had to clamp his mouth shut to stop himself from swearing. In the deep shadows of the traveler\u2019s blue robe, a little lightning-bolt pattern shone through.That\u2019s Steropes\u2019s pattern. Who is this man\u2026?\u00a0Could it be the one he\u2019d heard so many stories about? The idea was enough to make his body tremble.\u201cHic!\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2014hic!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you a question.\u201d\u201cS-say it\u2014hic!\u201dThe man peered at Shawn for a while.\u201cCan you tell me where the Academy is?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I repent.\u201dDid he always have this kind of personality?A noble\u2019s pride was so immense as to be incomprehensible to an ordinary person. They would put their lives on the line for their pride; bowing like this was nigh impossible. It was unthinkable for the Stens, one of the most prestigious families on the continent.\u201cIt\u2019s done\u2026\u201d Joshua grinned bitterly. \u201cI will lower myself since you are my opponent.\u201d\u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything you should beg forgiveness for.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Amaru\u2019s face brightened as he straightened up.\u201cIt\u2019s fine to express gratitude\u2014\u201d\u201cCan you teach me something?\u201dSo that was what he wanted.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have no idea what the point is with the stick you used\u2026 but before I lost consciousness, I felt a great power pushed into my gut.\u201dJoshua was confused enough for Amaru to see it in his expression.\u201cI learned that when two points are connected, the key to finishing the fight quickly is to reach the enemy as fast as possible. It\u2019s the easiest, fastest way.\u201cHowever, when I tried it with you, I felt my entire body twist as that power struck me. It seemed simple, but I feel like it\u2019s much more complicated than that.\u201dHe felt the magic \u201crevolving\u201d?\u00a0Joshua was astounded.\u00a0I had high expectations because he comes from Arie bron Sten\u2019s blood, but isn\u2019t he better than I thought?The boy had been struck by an unknown force and wracked by unbearable pain. He\u2019d almost lost his mind, but he still wasn\u2019t ashamed of his defeat; even standing in front of Joshua, an enemy just yesterday, he felt no shame in asking Joshua to teach him martial arts.Why didn\u2019t I know this guy in my past life?\u00a0Joshua rubbed his chin and pondered for a moment, then nodded as he found an answer.Agareth had said it: this young man had a very talented older sibling. As Joshua remembered, Arie bron Sten had one successor, and, unlike Amaru, that child didn\u2019t look anything like his father.The Sten family didn\u2019t follow the Agnus family in their downfall. They remained fully neutral thanks to the heir\u2019s remarkable ability to read the tides of war and rode it out through the end.Their family was not originally nobility\u2014their renaissance came after the appearance of Arie bron Sten. After he retired from the front lines, the Sten family did not produce another genius like him for decades. After his disappearance, the Sten family pursued a simpler life.But now\u2026 Sten is still a count. If this guy succeeded him\u2026\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes sparkled as he examined the boy. The Stens would enjoy prestige comparable to the Five Dukes by his estimations.But there was no \u201cif\u201d in history. It was not for Joshua\u2019s hand to turn around everyone\u2019s life for the better\u2014he had his own life to deal with.\u201cCan you teach me?\u201dJoshua\u2019s mouth twitched, and a giggle spilled out when he saw Amaru\u2019s impatiently expectant face.\u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOn one condition\u2014something taken, something given. I, too, have a few questions I\u2019d like you to answer.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 are we friends now?\u201d\u201cFriends?\u201dAmaru nodded eagerly. \u201cMutual assistance\u2014isn\u2019t that usually what you call friendship?\u201dJoshua burst out laughing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think, but I doubt it will be well-received by your friends.\u201d\u201cFriends?\u201d Amaru was the one confused this time.\u201cI met your circle of friends at the cafeteria the other day, remember?\u201d\u201cAh, them.\u201d Amaru scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t like them; it\u2019s just stupid to be alone. They follow me everywhere and annoy me. I never thought of them as friends; they\u2019re just a bunch of foxes lusting after power.\u201d\u201cThen get rid of them.\u201dJoshua abruptly changed topics.\u201cFinding euphoria isn\u2019t as easy as you believe.\u201d Amaru\u2019s ears pricked up as Joshua spoke. \u201c...The fastest way to euphoria, while connecting the dots, to be precise. Essentially, it isn\u2019t a straight line. Think about that on your own.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna tell me the whole story?\u201d Amaru stared wide-eyed at him. \u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re done?\u201d\u201cYou can only grow if you reach an understanding on your own\u2014it\u2019s like research. You\u2019ll get stuck for the rest of your life if you get the answer right away.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cNow\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cLet me ask you something.\u201dAmaru nodded without hesitation. \u201cAnything. Anything except my family\u2019s secret techniques.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Joshua was a little embarrassed that the Sten swordsmanship had come up.\u201cI have two inquiries: one is about the Academy\u2019s cliques; the other\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s voice became low and muffled.\u201cTell me all about Shimizu kun Douglas.\u201d\u201cAn urgent letter has arrived, Your Majesty.\u201dEmperor Marcus, pondering on his throne, raised his head. Jakan, the chief of his personal intelligence agency, bowed at the bottom of the stairs.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cA letter from Swallow has arrived.\u201d\u201cSwallow\u2026 Must be from Draxia.\u201d\u201cIt says that the plan will be executed sooner than anticipated; therefore, I request your assistance by altering Your Majesty\u2019s commitment to meet the time frame.\u201d\u201cIt seems Thran\u2019s retaliation is stronger than expected.\u201d Marcus laughed. \u201cAs We said, no military support is available. Draxia would be pleased if We sent the Empire\u2019s two lords.\u201d\u201cSend Geschard and Arie, and make sure to tell them to remain discreet. Is that enough?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Emperor Marcus nodded. \u201cWe shall order it. But if it comes to light that we\u2019re behind it, we may be accused of war crimes. We\u2019d be condemned across the continent. It\u2019s not something to be concerned about, but there\u2019s no harm in extra precautions.\u201dWith that, Marcus settled back into his throne.\u201cI\u2014there\u2019s one more thing. I have a separate report for you, Your Majesty?\u201dEmperor Marcus beckoned for Jaken to continue.\u201cJoshua von Agnus entered the Academy under the pseudonym \u2018Ash pen Frederick.\u2019\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 what a funny guy.\u201d Emperor Marcus could discuss the strangest things and his expression would show nothing but boredom. Now, however, his eyes sparkled with amusement.\u201cYes\u2026 He and Amaru bron Sten sparred because Joshua insulted the family\u2019s swordsmanship. It was a fight to restore the family\u2019s honor\u2014but Amaru lost.\u201d\u201cSten. Arie\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cAmusing.\u201d The Emperor\u2019s lips curled into an amused grin.It\u2019s like art.\u00a0The Stens, one of the greatest and proudest families in the Empire\u2014yet Joshua had so much fun after just his first day of school.Figures\u2026 Even Babel von Agnus was no match for him.\u201cJaken.\u201d Emperor Marcus folded his arms.\u201cYes, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cHave We ever expressed our concern about high-ranking aristocrats\u2019 hasty admissions?\u201dJaken quickly shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any of what you refer to. Good things come in small packages, and His Majesty was kind to those who exhibited the smallest amount of kindness.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The Emperor\u2019s smile widened. \u201cJaken, We have a task for you.\u201d\u201cName it, sire.\u201d\u201cEnlist that child in the Knights Templar. We will write a letter of recommendation, if necessary.\u201dJaken was shocked. Entering the Imperial Knights was hard enough\u2014but a recommendation letter from the Emperor himself?His was the highest seat in the Empire, and his word was law. No one could refuse him.\u201cOf course, We have considered that he defeated Our knights. How silly of Us to suggest that he needs a letter of recommendation.\u201dJoshua was still a child in the Emperor\u2019s eyes. Even as a child, he claimed to have been born with the greatest talent the world had ever seen.\u201cThe mana test he took was ten steps behind the Imperial Admission test, however.\u201dThe difficulty was increased because it was oriented towards real-world experience. From what the Emperor said, Joshua would be taking an informal exam rather than the official annual exam.One must put his life on the line or else be labeled a loser and thrown from his seat. He can kiss goodbye to becoming a knight\u2014is there a greater dishonor?\u00a0The loss would be unimaginable; like unripe fruit falling from the branch, he would become no more than garbage. That was why the Emperor proposed a letter of recommendation.However, it didn\u2019t take him long to realize that thinking about it was a waste of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A circle was a small group within the Academy dedicated to particular hobbies of extracurricular activities; the issue was Avalon Academy\u2019s definition of a circle was a bit different. They weren\u2019t made for fun; they were made as a way for the children to throw their weight around.Children, as usual, loved to show off to their peers. Seeing their classmates bowled over with one punch, or crushed by their family\u2019s might, made them feel a rush of success and satisfaction. The \u201ccircles\u201d are just a vehicle for it.The children of high-ranking aristocrats flex their power to form a circle with children of similar prestige. The children of lower-ranking aristocrats are left in the dust while the more prestigious families gather talents.They\u2019re not scared to kill the children who oppose them. There are hundreds of children from influential families, so the instructors have to watch themselves.That was what Kane was worried about.But you can\u2019t expect changes unless you adapt to reality. Leaving the matter untouched will create another vicious cycle.I\u2019m leaving this place, but I\u2019ll dismantle the system before I do.\u00a0Not out of some irrational sense of justice, but to serve his own ends.Perhaps I can win Icarus\u2019s heart more easily than I expected.\u00a0Joshua grinned.\u00a0I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Kaiser struggle after I steal Icarus from him.The door opened, and a young boy entered the room.\u201cThey claimed that if I said anything, a tiger would come for me\u2026\u201d Joshua laughed.Icarus froze.\u201cI see you were here first.\u201d\u201cAs you can see.\u201d\u201cWhat are your plans now? They say the Sten family is sending someone soon.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s no need to be concerned. I\u2019m getting along swimmingly with the person in question.\u201d\u201cYou met Young Master Amaru?\u201dJoshua nodded.\u201c...Even so, there\u2019s no assurance that the Stens won\u2019t act. They certainly feel like their swordsmanship hasn\u2019t received the recognition it deserves. It would help them reestablish their position.\u201cMore importantly, Araksha will surely approach Young Master Ash.\u201dRaksha was the largest circle in the Academy, according to Icarus.\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI can solve both of those problems at the same time.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u201d Icarus\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow do you plan on doing that?\u201d\u201cSimple: I just need to make them so scared they sweat just from hearing my voice. Anyone can understand power.\u201dThat\u2019s obviously impossible!\u00a0Icarus had to swallow a lump in his throat. Yet there was a curious expectation that the boy would actually do it.\u201cDo you recall our wager? You said you\u2019d grant my request if I defeated Amaru bron Sten and lived to tell the tale.\u201d\u201cI recall.\u201dI\u2019m going to say it now: I want you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Icarus gaped blankly at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cLiterally: Icarus, I want you to be my man.\u201dIcarus\u2019s face flushed.\u00a0Your wording is a little deceptive.\u00a0He calmed himself quickly, but his heartbeat refused to settle.Joshua approached and gripped Icarus firmly.\u201cWill you use your abilities solely for me?\u201dIcarus backed away from him.\u201cIf\u2026 If Young Master Ash actually makes his plan happen, I\u2019ll consider it.\u201dWith that, Icarus turned around and left the room.\u201cIsn\u2019t this progress?\u201d Joshua grinned.What Icarus was thinking, he didn\u2019t bother wondering.\u201cHooh. Hooh.\u201dA man stood inside of a small training ground lit by the sun. He exhaled hot air, carefully managing his focus; blood and sweat dripped to the floor from the wounds on his body. His swords were slack in his grip as if they could fall at any moment.It was Cain, Joshua\u2019s first knight.\u201cAre you sure this is enough to protect your lord? Looking at you now, I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t trip and twist your ankle in a battle.\u201dCain bit his lips hard. The insults made him want to hurl himself at his opponent, but he knew that any mistake would cost him his life. The man closed the distance between them with a quiet stillness, filling the space with his massive presence.Cain, on the other hand, could not manage a single step. His body had been pushed to its limits as he swung his sword with all his might for three hours under the withering sun. Cain\u2019s skin was marred by cuts big and small, enough to put down a lesser man\u2014but Cain fought through by sheer force of will.The approaching man looked down his nose at Cain for a moment.\u201cYou\u2019ve bled too much now. It\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re still standing, just looking at your wounds.\u201d The man\u2019s expression was mild and unchanging. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sudden urge to change weapons?\u201d\u201c...Ankle.\u201d Cain\u2019s voice was shaky and tenuous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to twist my ankle.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The man seemed amused by his familiar choice of words.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be a stumbling block to my chosen master; I want to be an asset. That\u2019s why\u2014no matter what, no matter how many wounds I take\u2014I can\u2019t break that promise.\u201d\u201cPromise?\u201dCain nodded without hesitation. \u201cNo one\u2026 He will ensure that I bow to no one except him. I promised my lord\u2026 to guard and trust my master. My aim, from now on\u2014to be strong.\u201dCain gripped the blades with all his remaining strength. He staggered but swiftly recovered his strength.\u201cSo now\u2026 I respectfully decline the Duke\u2019s offer.\u201d Cain leaped off the ground towards Duke Agnus, eyes burning with passion. One would not believe that just a moment ago, he\u2019d been on the verge of unconsciousness.\u201cYour determination is admirable.\u201d Duke Agnus watched Cain soar towards him with a faint grin.The Duke gently swung his magenta greatsword up and down. The training ground was instantly filled with its raging light, hurling Cain\u2019s body into the corner before he could even get close to Duke Agnus.He was defeated.\u201cTake him and heal him.\u201d Duke Agnus spared the unconscious knight a glance as he turned away.\u201cYes, Duke!\u201d Several knights, waiting nearby, moved quickly to follow the Duke\u2019s orders.\u201cTo make one of my people so loyal in such a short amount of time\u2026\u201dAsking the Duke to teach swordsmanship to this guy was ridiculous. The first time the Duke had heard it, he\u2019d been furious at Joshua\u2014but now, his anger had vanished.All that was left was an inexplicable feeling of contentment and delight.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to bow to anyone except him?\u201d Duke Agnus\u2019s grin stretched widely as he left the training ground. \u201cHow fun.\u201d\u201cDuke.\u201d Baron Hed, the Duke\u2019s exclusive servant, was waiting outside. \u201cIntelligence says that the Imperial Family will complete \u2018the task\u2019 soon.\u201dBaron Hed immediately had the Duke\u2019s full attention.\u201c...What\u2019s the source?\u201d\u201cThe Sten family.\u201d\u201cIs this directly from Arie?\u201d\u201cFor more information, take a look at this letter.\u201d Baron Hed pulled a paper from his breast pocket and reverently held it out with both hands.Duke Agnus silently took the letter and began reading it. He quickly checked the contents and then burned the letter with his ring\u2019s fire magic.\u201cShould I say\u2026 Finally?\u201d\u201cDo you have any plans?\u201dDuke Agnus shook his head. \u201cFor the time being, I have no choice but to watch. There\u2019s nothing we can do right now on our end.\u201d The Duke seemed to fall deep into thought and then started moving quickly. \u201cIn any case, if you notice anything unexpected, report it right away.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d Baron Hed bowed deeply.Duke Agnus\u2019s face was more serious than ever as he hurried on his way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Discussions were held daily inside the Imperial Palace in Svenu, the capital of the Swallow Empire. A middle-aged man sat on the throne before the arrayed nobility; his thick golden beard and droopy eyes gave off a pleasant, tranquil-as-could-be atmosphere. In contrast to Emperor Marcus, known as a despot and a tyrant, the emperor of Swallow was renowned as the greatest sage of all time.\u201cYour Majesty, now is the time to make a decision!\u201d Duke Altsma, the commander of the north, had a sharply angled chin and gave off a striking impression.\u201cYour Majesty, Duke Altsma is correct.\u201d A man in full plate armor stepped forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that if we monitor our neighbors like this, things will turn out the way they want.\u201dMany of the nobles raised their voices when Duke Baxter, the man in armor, spoke up.\u201cThran has been a vassal for a long time. There\u2019s no need to calculate every move!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re going to give them a new reason to fight!\u201d\u201cGive me the order, Your Majesty! I\u2019ll go right now and take the reactionaries\u2019 heads off!\u201dIn the freezing north of the continent, the Swallow Empire was known for its aggressive inhabitants, in contrast to its unflinchingly pacifist emperor.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The Emperor looked confused. \u201cWhat does the Prime Minister think about this?\u201dA white-bearded old man approached to answer the Emperor. The Prime Minister was known as the sage of Swallow, and he had a keen sense for the country\u2019s undercurrents.\u201cIt\u2019s only my personal opinion, sire, but we cannot remain insensitive to the activity of our neighboring countries\u2014\u201d\u201cPrime Minister! What are you trying to say? Are you implying we should just stay silent about those sly foxes?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I said, Duke Altsma.\u201d The Prime Minister rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cAnd please refrain from calling them \u2018foxes.\u2019 We are all aware of just how much power those two countries hold, just as we are aware of how much power we have.\u201dDuke Altsma\u2019s face flushed red.\u201cLet me ask you: do you think you can defeat every kingdom on the continent, including Avalon and Hubalt, when you start a war?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Duke Altsma\u2019s reply was immediate\u2014joyful, even. \u201cEven if a million armies stood in my way, I know I can defeat them. Just grant me permission, Your Majesty.\u201cEven the Nine Stars\u2014their standards are so low it\u2019s not even funny! Those so-called \u2018Absolutes\u2019! \u2018Titan of Avalon,\u2019 Duke Aden von Agnus; \u2018Knight of the Gods,\u2019 Crysler Jean Sebastian. I don\u2019t know who gave them those nicknames, but they\u2019re awfully tacky.\u201d\u201cDo you think Duke has a chance to beat them?\u201dDuke Altsma rolled his eyes and slapped his chest.\u201cPrime Minister! Just leave it to me,\u201d he said with a confident nod. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll bring you their heads!\u201dThe Prime Minister gave him a slight shake of his head. \u201cYou seem to be forgetting something:\u00a0He\u00a0and Grand Duke Lucifer are both part of the Nine Stars.\u201d\u201cSo? I\u2019m talking about the other Nine Stars! Please don\u2019t compare them.\u201dThe Prime Minister could only shut his mouth and sigh. Apparently, words wouldn\u2019t work. If the Duke didn\u2019t want to see reason, there was nothing the Prime Minister could do about it. At the very least, they both wanted the best for the Empire.\u201cEnough\u2026 We all know how good the Duke of Altsma is.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d Duke Altsma stared blankly at the Emperor.\u201cTigers do their best even when catching rabbits because they know their prey\u2014but didn\u2019t you say it yourself? You\u2019ve never met one of the Nine Stars.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Duke Altsma\u2019s face scrunched.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re confident enough to win, even if you don\u2019t know your opponent,\u201d the Emperor continued with a calm expression. \u201cYou do know that\u2019s not called \u2018confidence?\u2019 That\u2019s called \u2018arrogance.\u2019 You might be stronger than them, but so what? Even small animals can have tricks up their sleeves.\u201cNor is it just the Duke\u2019s problem if he loses. It will be a major national issue, as well as a serious setback for the Empire as a whole.\u201d\u201cI apologize, Your Majesty. My thoughts were shallow.\u201dThe Emperor just nodded as Duke Altsma back down.\u201cPrime Minister, I would like to hear your thoughts.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. I understand.\u201d The Prime Minister cleared his throat and resumed speaking as if nothing had happened. \u201cThe other two kingdoms won\u2019t be able to move quickly\u2014that much is certain. Everything is under control, so we don\u2019t need to worry about them for now.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, the two empires can mobilize very quickly. We need special precautions for that. Hubalt, however, is occupied with tending to the new pope of the Holy Empire.\u201dThe Emperor nodded thoughtfully. \u201cHas it already taken place?\u201dUniquely, the Holy Empire Hubalt had two rulers: the Emperor, who held absolute power, and the Pope, who had no particular powers but was symbolically significant. Hubalt had adopted this system in an effort to stand out, emulating the empires of old. Essentially, it was a grand play to gain popularity.Every five years, the Hubalt Empire elects a new pope; this year happened to be that year.\u201cIt allows us to concentrate a little more on Thran, but the issue is\u2026 Avalon.\u201dThe Emperor sighed. Everyone knew it before the Prime Minister said anything.It\u2019s always like this\u2026 Like a mountain beyond a mountain again.After a moment\u2019s deliberation, the Emperor rose from his seat.\u201cWe shall not make hasty actions so long as Thran has not made their move yet. Lords, be prepared for battle at any moment.\u201dThe nobility voiced their agreement. With that, the meeting was adjourned. The Emperor was left alone with one person.\u201cMarco. Is it true that\u00a0He\u00a0is a major character in Thran?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0He\u00a0hasn\u2019t shown up recently, but everyone acknowledges that he\u2019s Thran\u2019s ally in spirit.\u201d\u201cUlabis\u2026\u201d The Emperor stared out the window and shook his head disbelievingly. \u201cIs it such a poor notion to wish for peace and happiness for the entire continent?\u201d\u201cIt takes a lot of strength to safeguard happiness.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s forlorn eyes stared into space.He was the greatest sage in the history of the Swallow Empire, revered by all of its people. His name was Veron belle Grace, 21st emperor of Swallow.Is he connected to Icarus?\u00a0Joshua grit his teeth angrily.After Icarus left the room, an unwelcome visitor arrived and preached to Joshua.\u201cYou have no idea what Raksha is like! If you think they\u2019re just a bunch of kids playing pretend, you\u2019re dead wrong! Their circle is not as simple as you think!\u201d Agareth massages his temples\u2014 his typical dumb expression was nowhere to be found. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll stop at just your academy life? No! You and your family will be in jeopardy if you keep this up. Even if you flee, they\u2019ll hunt you down and torment you!\u201cI told you to be patient, Joshua. If you keep being stubborn, you\u2019ll never make it out alive!\u201d Agareth turned around, hands visibly shaking. \u201cDo as I say, this time. Really, I\u2019m trying to help you.\u201dJoshua burst out laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\u201c...What?\u201d\u201cI was asking if you were worried because something similar happened to your brother.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Agareth bit his lip.\u201cYou can run away if you\u2019re scared; no one will judge you.\u201dAgareth stepped forward threateningly, mumbling curses under his breath.\u201cWhat do you know\u2014\u201d\u201cBut!\u201d Joshua met Agareth\u2019s advance, causing the other boy to pause as Joshua approached. \u201cThe first time is difficult. Then, you get used to it. Then, you get bored. Then, it just becomes like clockwork.\u201dJoshua pressed in close to Agareth\u2019s face, his words stabbing at him like a dagger to the heart.\u201cThey\u2019ll make you sorry,\u201d Agareth shouted as Joshua walked out the door. \u201cTheir leader is Veron shen Villas\u2014one of the Twelve Families!\u201dJoshua howled with laughter.\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Agareth stared blankly at him.\u201cI said, it\u2019s good that it\u2019s Veron.\u201dThe door shut firmly behind Joshua, leaving Agareth to stare blankly at the wall.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaksha had claimed a spacious chamber on the 4th floor of the Academy, in the far most corner. In some small way, the kids rebelled against the Imperial Family\u2019s oppressive power by forming a sort of Court\u2014though a gaggle of teenagers could not emulate the solemnity of a proper Court.Besides the sons of the Five Dukes, who completed their Academy life much faster than anyone else, all the sons of the most powerful families are part of the famed Raksha. At the moment, however, only three chairs were set up in a room fit for a hundred. Their owners had already been decided; the other children stood silently behind them.The girl in the leftmost seat finally broke the suffocating silence. Her voice was crisp and high. She had high eyebrows and vivid green hair that inevitably aroused memories of vegetables.\u201cI believe everything is in order; shall we start this meeting?\u201d\u201cWhat are you making a fuss about, Natasha? Are you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019re always in a rush.\u201d A small-eyed boy on the right shrugged his shoulders. His thin chin and broad forehead lent his head a distinct triangular shape. In Natasha\u2019s opinion, he looked like a frightened pig, but his face always exuded smugness.Natasha muttered \u201cfreak\u201d under her breath and clicked her tongue.\u201cGehog, you\u2019re way too relaxed, always. Marquis Crombell must be concerned, but he\u2019s too busy to worry about his children.\u201d\u201cWell, a family business will still be a family business. I\u2019m just enjoying the moment\u2014what\u2019s there to worry about for a kid like me, anyway?\u201d\u201cIdiot.\u201d Natasha shot Gehog a dirty look.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Charles de Pontier was here? She\u2019d be much more amusing.\u201dThe mention of the Crombells\u2019 ongoing feud with the Pontiers made Natasha shiver.1\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Gehog grinned. \u201cAll else aside, Charles has a lovely face. It\u2019s so much better than you and your moods.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say? Say it again!\u201d\u201cStop being an idiot and think carefully! Do you think anyone would like a girl who runs her mouth?!\u201dNatasha flushed and leapt from her seat.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cStop this instant. This isn\u2019t the time for your childish brawl.\u201d The emerald-haired boy in the middle restrained them with his low voice.Both of them turned to look at Veron shen Villas.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not backing down until that three-headed jerk apologizes for what he said!\u201d\u201cOh, really?! Coming from the puked-up vegetable head?!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Veron stared at Natasha, who rolled her eyes and sighed, and then looked at Gehog.\u201cGehog, that\u2019s too much. Natasha only spoke out of concern for you and your father. Why don\u2019t you apologize first?\u201d\u201cHer concern is unnecessary.\u201d\u201cThe rift between your family and the Pontiers is quite concerning indeed. I\u2019ve heard news that physical fights are happening; how can we, as comrades, not be worried about you?\u201d\u201cPfffft.\u201d Gehog was bemused by the way Veron casually labeled them as comrades.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on elsewhere, but you have no need to be concerned about the Pontier family. As merchants, we can match them in every way; I\u2019m sure that even the Mercenary King is on our side at this point.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201dGehog nodded. \u201cIn a few more years, Marquis Crombell will control all the money in the Empire.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t rush. Please let me know if you need help, anytime.\u201d Veron smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019ll inform my father\u2014the Marquis of Villas will be happy to assist.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cShall we begin the meeting now that we\u2019re reasonably organized?\u201d\u201cHave you heard the rumors?\u201d Natasha asked. \u201cAmaru bron Sten was assaulted by a Viscount\u2019s son\u2014what\u2019s worse, a fallen nobleman\u2019s son!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re correct.\u201d Veron nodded.\u201cWhat kind of kid is he? This is amazing!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s like that again.\u201d Gehog was taken aback, even knowing Natasha\u2019s masculine tendencies. \u201cNow, how do we do\u00a0that\u00a0again?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Let\u2019s see how it turns out.\u201d\u201cThis is insane\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t take this lightly, Gehog.\u201d Veron shook his head. \u201cPlease pay attention.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking, Veron? He\u2019s a fallen nobleman\u2019s child! He disrespected a high-ranking student\u2014Amaru\u2019s family has ties to the Emperor!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. Veron is acting weird.\u201d\u201cWe\u2026\u201d Veron\u2019s face tensed nervously. \u201cWe\u2019ve met before.\u201d\u201cAh?!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe surrounding students broke into murmurs. It must have been quite surprising to hear that two apparently-unrelated people had already met before.\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? That kid already knows the child of Marquis Villas?\u201d\u201cWho is he really? It\u2019s even rumored that he\u2019s connected to the Fourth Prince, Kaiser von Britten.\u201d\u201cIs he foreign royalty? Maybe he\u2019s using a pseudonym?\u201d Natasha\u2019s eyes sparkled as she hypothesized.\u201cNot a chance, Natasha.\u201d Veron\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild guess, but as far as my research tells me, none of the Empire\u2019s higher nobility or royalty from other countries have dark blue hair.\u201d\u201cHair colors are genetic, which tells us a lot, but what of his skills? Were they unique and powerful?\u201d\u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Gehog said in hushed tones.\u201cI hate to say it, but\u2026\u201d Veron pressed his lips into a white line before smoothing out his expression. \u201cHis abilities are genuine. If you asked me if Amaru really got beaten into a pulp, I\u2019d say \u2018yes\u2019 without a doubt. The son of Sten is still not even close to being a C-Class; no matter how strong his heritage is, it\u2019s impossible for him to beat Ash. My escort knight was one of his many victims.\u201d\u201cYour escort knight\u2026 Mooker?!\u201d Gehog\u2019s calm shattered. \u201cMooker is a B-Class Knight! And Ash is a first-year, right? He only recently entered the Academy\u2014is it even possible for him to beat a B-Class Knight?!\u201d\u201cMy word\u2014These\u2026 revelations are too much for me to absorb.\u201dThe students around them looked to have similar reactions but stifled their words. None were brave enough to interrupt the children of the Twelve Families.Gehog gently broached the stillness.\u201cWhy not recruit him? Everything goes well whatever we do anyways.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Veron looked at Gehong, thinking he must have misheard. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAmaru, well\u2026 I never enjoyed his company; none of us liked him because he was forced on us. If Ash is truly talented, he will be a great asset for us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, as well,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cWe had to get close to Amaru because he\u2019s a Sten, but things have changed, haven\u2019t they? He sullied his family\u2019s reputation. I don\u2019t think the Stens will be concerned about Amaru anymore.\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten?\u201d Veron shook his head.\u201d Even with no backing from his parents, his brother will be a hindrance.\u201d\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Veron continued. \u201cAsh pen Frederick\u2014I hate him.\u201d The boy grit his teeth, remembering the humiliation Joshua had inflicted on him.\u201cOh\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a good relationship?\u201d\u201cIdiot. What do you think made him so popular among the other students? Come on; there would be no reason for Mooker to attack him.\u201dVeron sulked while the other two discussed.\u201cIn any case,\u201d he growled. \u201cI won\u2019t sit here and let him do as he wishes.\u201d\u201cHow will you silence him if Mooker was no match for him, and his skills are as great as you claim?\u201d\u201cShimizu kun Douglas.\u201d Veron offered them a cheeky smirk.\u201cAha!\u201d\u201cRight. He\u2019s a fallen aristocrat. There\u2019s no one around him.\u201dI\u2019ll make you regret reaching above your station.Joshua was in the top floor of the Academy, standing in front of a door.\u201cDean\u2019s Office.\u201d Joshua sighed and muttered something inaudible. He\u2019d suddenly been called by the Dean; Joshua had been expecting this, but it still caught him by surprise.Does it have something to do with Amaru?This is why he was trying to hide his identity. Too much attention will hinder his recovery\u2014but things didn\u2019t always go as planned.Joshua rapped on the door with a resigned expression.\u201cIt\u2019s Ash pen Frederick.\u201dThere was no response, despite his heavy knocking. Joshua tilted his head curiously and decided to open the door.In the middle of the darkened room was a lone man. His body was draped in a black cape, disguising his body.Joshua had never seen him before, but he was damn sure that this was not the Dean.\u201cJoshua von Agnus?\u201d The voice was eerie and monotone.You know who I am?The man in black examined Joshua\u2019s expression and slowly stood from his seat.\u201cLooks right.\u201dJoshua stared into the deep, deep eyes hidden inside the mask.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe Crombells are the rich merchant family that the Pontiers have been competing with. See Chapter 35.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019d never heard the name before.\u201cHave you heard of an organization called \u2018Black Wind\u2019?\u201d\u201cBlack Wind!\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes widened.The Emperor\u2019s personal intelligence agency, known only by name except to the highest-ranking aristocrats. They were elites among elites, answered only to the Emperor, and would die for him if he ordered it. Black Wind wasn\u2019t known to the general public, but Joshua was intimately familiar with it from his past life\u2019s memories.In particular, the Assassin King was a member. Joshua had mixed feelings about them.\u201cI asked if you were aware.\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, although it\u2019s not a complicated topic.\u201d Jaken\u2019s eyes gleamed. He didn\u2019t bother asking how Joshua knew. \u201cBy His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s command, I have come to deliver a message.\u201d\u201cHim? He sent you personally?\u201dJaken nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been dispatched in secret in order to simplify the procedure. Be grateful for his consideration.\u201dGenerally, a proxy had to be treated the same as the person they represented\u2014in other words, even the highest noble, a duke, is forced to bow before the Emperor\u2019s agents. Nobles would usually be polite enough to send someone appropriately ranked as their agent, but some would deliberately send a low-ranking agent to humiliate them.Joshua despised tedious procedures; typically, he would welcome this, but\u2026Weirdly, it puts me in a foul mood.\u201cAre you still talking nonsense?\u201d Joshua\u2019s mouth twisted into a nasty smile.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaken boggled at him.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even delivered His Majesty\u2019s will yet, but it\u2019s obvious this conversation is going nowhere.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Did you expect me to address you formally?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Black Wind\u2019s agents abandoned their real names and families. You have no title, but you think you can talk like that to me?\u201dAn institution that reported directly to the Emperor had great authority in the Avalon Empire. Even the Twelve Families and Five Dukes tread lightly around them; it was ridiculous for Joshua to be acting like this.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you? Strictly speaking, only your father is a nobleman.\u201d\u201cOh, so the Black Wind, the Imperial Family\u2019s eyes and ears, doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dJoshua shrugged mockingly.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that anyone who becomes a C-Class Knight is immediately bestowed the rank of Baron? Or were you completely unaware that I am a C-Class Knight?\u201d\u201cHoho.\u201d Jaken chuckled.\u201cWhat amuses you?\u201d\u201cNothing. Pardon me for laughing. However, the rumors said you were very mature for your age\u2014but it seems like you\u2019re no different from the other kids your age.\u201d\u201cAh, they do spread those kinds of rumors, I see.\u201d\u201cYes, they do.\u201d Jaken nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk more, but I\u2019m short on time. Even if you concealed your identity, you wouldn\u2019t want a never-ending chat either. I will announce His Majesty\u2019s will now:\u201c\u2018Listen, Joshua von Agnus. Your letter to the Fourth Prince was to Our liking. Still, would you not come under Our command? Our hands itch because of this pleasant feeling.\u2019\u201d Jaken coughed. \u201c\u2018We sincerely hope that you will join the Imperial Knights. We wish for you to entertain Us for a little longer; We have heard how brilliant you are, so you will know what We mean.\u201d\u201c..Is that it?\u201d\u201cYes, that is all. He also mentioned that if a letter of recommendation is required, he would be more than happy to write it himself\u2014and if you can\u2019t come, hang in there.\u201d Jaken stood up. \u201cHe also encouraged me to bring you, even if you were kicked out for different reasons.\u201dJoshua laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard he\u2019s a fascinating individual, but His Majesty seems a little different from the rumors.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d Jaken\u2019s expression became frigid.\u201cNothing.\u201d Joshua shrugged. \u201cI just find it fascinating that he seems to have a perfect talent for spotting talented people.\u201d\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d Jaken said, \u201cwith Babel von Agnus already graduated, you being here will greatly impact your future. It\u2019s not impossible, but\u2026\u201d Jaken walked past Joshua. \u201cArcadia is different from Agnus. If you fall off the rails, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d\u201cThe will of the Emperor is absolute,\u201d Jaken told Joshua as he walked out. \u201cPlease visit the Imperial Palace as soon as possible. And please take care here.\u201dJoshua watched Jaken vanish from view.\u201cShould I move the plan forwards a little?\u201d he muttered.Joshua took one last glance in the direction Jaken had left, then walked away.Classes were over. In a vacant lot behind the Academy, a child writhed on the floor surrounded by snickering children. His clothes were caked in dust, and his skin was bruised, cut, and torn. His glossy sky-blue hair glittered in the sunlight despite the dust and dirt.\u201cIcarus! Veron shen Villas, you motherfucker!\u201d Agareth cradled the bloodied Icarus.\u201cWhoa, Agareth! Take a deep breath and relax.\u201d The gloomy-eyed boy leading the gang smirked. \u201cWhy are you acting like this? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time this has happened. Besides, this guy is just a commoner, unlike last time. He\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you torturing me like this?\u201d Agareth screamed. \u201cWhat did I do to you guys?\u201d\u201cDid I ever say you did anything wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gehog, next to Veron, answered him. \u201cIf having the wrong older brother was the crime the first time, this time it\u2019s the crime of having the wrong friend.\u201d\u201cYou heard that, right? Now\u2026 What did your nerdy roommate do this time?\u201dAgareth grit his teeth.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been at school for a few days. Do you think he regards us as friends?\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, but I know he\u2019s outgoing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Agareth was taken aback by Veron\u2019s statement.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the specifics. You have a straightforward task: bring your friend here, right away.\u201dAgareth\u2019s eyes widened.They didn\u2019t have to explain what they were doing because I already knew.\u00a0Agareth went through the same thing.\u201cAs you might expect,\u201d Veron exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m going to kidnap both of you and shatter all his limbs. If that guy pulls any silly stunts, your family might be in trouble. I don\u2019t need to say anything else, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about it,\u201d Gehog said. \u201cHe\u2019s from fallen aristocracy with no roots. We ought to come up with a backup plan in case we can\u2019t get someone to vent on.\u201d\u201cBy the way,\u201d Natasha said, nudging Icarus\u2019s head with her toe, \u201ddo you think this kid will be scared even if we threaten his family? He\u2019s adopted anyway.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking? Adopted or not, we\u2019ll figure it out!\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d Natasha stared at Icarus.\u201cTo put it another way, this guy is a low-value hostage. So, you want to play a little game with me?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s at it again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fresh start.\u201d Gehog shook his head, dissatisfied.\u201cDo you know how sad this guy\u2019s brother made me?\u201d Natasha jerked her chin at Agareth. \u201cHe was my taste, but he\u2019s such a jerk.\u201dIf only I were a little stronger\u2026!\u00a0Agareth bit his lip hard enough to draw blood.These were the real powers in the Academy, not the Imperial Family.\u201cYou know what happens if your friend is late?\u201d Natasha reached down and tugged on Icarus\u2019s shirt.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Agareth leapt up, refusing to watch Natasha\u2019s filthy hand unveil Icarus\u2019s pure white body.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. I\u2019m already here.\u201d\u201cAsh pen Frederick!\u201d Veron screamed at him as he recalled the awful memories Joshua had given him.\u201cVeron shen Villas. You\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d Joshua replied with a chilly smile.Veron flinched but quickly replaced it with a smug expression.\u201cAre you going to follow through?\u201d\u201cTouching my friends is a bigger offense than you seem to believe.\u201dAgareth\u2019s eyes moistened when Joshua called them \u201cfriends.\u201d\u201cYou? You have friends?\u201d Veron shot him a disbelieving expression.\u201cI\u2019m here to judge you for that crime, so\u2026 do look forward to it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You know that I have the authority to expel you and them from the Academy; I also have the power to torment their families for the rest of their lives. You must have a reason for coming to the Academy. Don\u2019t throw it all away now.\u201dJoshua finally came to a halt, much to Veron\u2019s pleasure.\u201cAh, finally. Now we can talk. The reality here is that family power is everything\u2014so what options do you have?\u201d\u201cAre you really that great? What do you want?\u201d\u201cSeems pointless,\u201d Natasha mumbled under her breath.\u201cLet me ask you something\u2026 Why return this?\u201d Something on Veron\u2019s finger glittered in the sunlight as he waved his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for lesser or fallen aristocrats like you, but this is a bigger deal than you think. You could buy an entire castle for this thing.\u201d\u201cVeron, he wouldn\u2019t even know if you told him. It\u2019s just a normal ring to that kid.\u201d\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t have taken it and threatened me with it if he hadn\u2019t known.\u201d Veron shook his head.Gehog shrugged. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this makes me even more curious about your relationship. And I supposed you\u2019ve insulted Veron too much.\u201d\u201cIs it appropriate to talk about this in front of these kids?\u201d Natasha looked worried. \u201cIf the rumors get around, your father\u2019s going to hear\u2014\u201d\u201cWho would dare?! At this point, it doesn\u2019t matter. If somebody lets slip to my father, I\u2019ll stop at nothing to hunt them down.\u201dA stiff silence weighed down on the assembled students.\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Veron said to Joshua. \u201cYou could have scared me for a long time with this; it would have ended poorly, but you would have lived.\u201d\u201cIf I did, what would be the difference between you and me?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d be no different from scum like you, right?\u201dThe students stirred in surprise. They couldn\u2019t believe someone was trash-talking the Villas heir, especially where so many people could see. Was he insane?\u201cThe Sten swordsmanship also got called trash\u2026\u201d\u201cIs he insane? What makes him so bold?\u201d\u201cHow can you talk like that unless you belong to the Imperial Family or the Five Dukes?\u201d\u201cThree of the Twelve Families are represented here\u2014even the Five Dukes wouldn\u2019t challenge us. I mean, I guess Duke Agnus or Duke Dremblin could\u2026\u201dVeron smirked.\u201cOf course you keep up the act. I would\u2019ve been upset if you changed your tune.\u201dVeron then pumped mana into his Deon Ring. A faint light rose from it, growing larger and larger. Soon, Veron\u2019s entire body was coated in the light; through the glow, a faint rustling could be heard.The light fell away, revealing Veron completely encased in plate mail. Its magically-lightened bulk was a stunning, polished silver. Red feathers on the helmet\u2019s crest flapped elegantly in the wind, and the sword-and-shield motif of the Villas house was embossed prominently on the chest.\u201cKyaaa! Isn\u2019t Veron\u2019s Deon Ring always gorgeous compared to the other B-Class?\u201d\u201cShould I get mine modified?\u201d\u201cWho knows,\u201d Natasha snorted at Gehog, \u201cmaybe your father will be happy to trade you for a good Deon Ring.\u201d\u201cIdiot.\u201dVeron stepped closer, and Gehog licked his lips in anticipation.\u201cWake him up.\u201dIcarus was doused with cold water from a barrel they\u2019d had prepared.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d The water jolted Icarus awake. Even soaking wet, his sky-blue hair and immaculate white skin glowed.\u201cI\u2019m going to break his limbs, one by one. Having the wrong friend is a crime, you see.\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201d Agareth exclaimed.\u201cAs your senior, I\u2019d advise you to stay still unless you want to see this gentleman and his family die.\u201dJoshua met Icarus\u2019s eyes.It must be painful and frightening.\u00a0Icarus\u2019s tiny frame shook uncontrollably.Yet, his gaze was unwavering. Something in Joshua\u2019s heart soared and raged when Icarus solemnly shook his head.I know what it\u2019s like to have something you need to protect.\u201cYou\u2019re just like Shimizu kun Douglas, this bastard\u2019s older brother.\u201d Veron jerked his chin in Agareth\u2019s direction. \u201cAn idiot who didn\u2019t know his place and dared to cross the line and try to change this place. A complete idiot. Instead of joining hands with me and living a pleasant life in the Academy, he would rather go to the professors to snitch and beg for help. He didn\u2019t even know we\u2019d already bought out half the staff in the Academy. Funny, right?\u201d\u201cStop\u2026 Please stop.\u201d Agareth desperately tried to block his ear.\u201cIt was annoying, you know? I mean, who would take the tough road when you can live in luxury? But you know what I did with him?\u201d Veron grinned at Agareth. \u201cI turned him into a cripple.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes dilated slightly.\u201cOf course, it got waved off as an accident. I initially planned on just murdering him, but I figured that would be too inconvenient. Making him atone as a lame didn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 No one can use their funny words when we threaten their family, right?\u201dNatasha raised her hand. \u201cThe Douglas family cannot threaten us without concrete evidence.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your name was Ash, right? If you pay close attention, I\u2019ll make sure you avoid any unfortunate accidents.\u201d\u201cYou, Natasha\u2014!\u201d Gehog started to protest but noticed her give him a little wink.Are you planning on playing with him before you crush him?\u00a0Gehog stepped back.\u00a0You got it right, crazy woman.\u201cIs that all right, Veron?\u201d Natasha asked.\u201c...My business comes first. It\u2019s time to get rid of that unfortunate eye color; it seems to be begging me to remove them.\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t want to scratch those blue eyes because they\u2019re so uncommon\u2026\u201d Natasha thought about it for a second. \u201cShould I just give up? Hmm, no\u2026\u201d She suddenly clapped her hands. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because Veron noticed you first, right? When I think about it, having one eye is a different kind of charm too!\u201d\u201cHahaha. Right, crazy bitch.\u201d\u201c...What did you say, Gehog?\u201d Natasha gave him a frosty glare.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d He waved his hand dismissively.\u201cHuh?!\u201dVeron stopped paying attention to them and turned his focus back to Joshua.\u201cLet me pull those cheeky eyes out before I break this guy\u2019s arm.\u201d Veron stepped forward confidently. The fear creeping up on his heart had been washed away by the reassuring weight of the Deon Ring wrapped around him.A C-Class Knight can barely scratch a B-Class Deon Ring. If you\u2019re not as careless as that idiot\u2026\u00a0Veron gripped his blade and cautiously approached Joshua, watching for a surprise attack.\u201cYou mentioned something like\u2026 \u2018Family is everything here.\u2019\u201dVeron paused. \u201cOkay, so you plan to rely on your feeble strength to flee\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kind of right.\u201d Joshua drew something out of his sleeves.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014!\u201d Veron, the closest person to Joshua, quickly figured out what it was. \u201cDeon Ring?!\u201dNo way!\u00a0There\u2019s no way a fallen noble would have a Deon Ring.\u201cYou!\u201d Veron backed away, recalling Mooker\u2019s words.\u201cLet me show you the power you were boasting about.\u201d Joshua shoved the Deon Ring onto his finger and injected it with mana.A thundering resonance, far beyond what Veron displayed, shook the air around them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJoshua was seething. This should be a place of learning, not a stage for bragging about your family\u2019s power. A child\u2019s mind should have more than one kind of emotion.Why is this place like this? Is this all they know?\u00a0They said things like \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cdestroy their family\u201d without batting an eye! Maybe it was just their upbringing, but these were things for adults, not children.Joshua\u2019s rage fueled the Deon Ring; it shook like a ticking bomb while Joshua\u2019s searing gaze bored into Veron.The ring itself was white with a golden disc in its center. It was beautifully crafted, with no signs of aging or damage.It enveloped Joshua\u2019s body in a purple glow, blinding the children with a blast of light. Unlike Veron\u2019s quiet transformation, the clamor of Joshua\u2019s Deon Ring rattled their senses and left them reeling.\u201cUgh\u2014!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too bright\u2014what is this power?\u201dVeron cautiously opened his teary eyes as the light began to fade.Icarus held Agareth, and then the two of them vanished from Veron\u2019s sight. As Veron\u2019s sight cleared, he saw that they had moved beside the source of the overpowering purple glow. Like everyone else, their gaze was captured by one thing.The boy stood in front of them, chin up and with a perfect knight\u2019s posture. He looked so dashing you could mistake him for a prince\u2014blasphemy, but true. His white armor was immaculate, and the black lining and golden trim drew nothing but admiration. All of it harmonized with Joshua\u2019s face, offering the spectators the pinnacle of beauty.But that wasn\u2019t the most striking detail.Is this how the legendary Elyos descended from the sky?On the boy\u2019s chest was the symbol of Elyos.There was only one place in the Avalon Empire where you could see this insignia. The \u201cKnight\u2019s Tomb,\u201d a small hillside marked on the side with a sword and shield.\u201cThat pattern\u2014is it\u2026?\u201dThere was a legend in the Avalon Empire that had been passed down for generations: the noble knights of Avalon were said to return to the bosom of nature when they died. Even when the body perished, the knights\u2019 wills remained with the Empire forever.Eventually, the legend reached the Emperor\u2019s ears. The 7th Emperor, Solsjaker ben Roberto, constructed a massive memorial stele and dubbed it the \u201cKnight\u2019s Tomb.\u201dThe will of the knights will always be with you, even beyond death.\u201cThis monument is dedicated to the greatest knights of the Empire of the time. Those families who climb to the apex of Knighthood will be honored by the will of Avalon for ages to come.\u201dOf course, you had to prove yourself; Emperor Solsjaker wouldn\u2019t settle for just \u201cthe best.\u201dThe issue is that the tombstone has never been moved once in over a century. Many families have produced Masters, but the \u201cbest\u201d had never changed. Thus, one family had become deeply associated with the Knight\u2019s Tomb.\u201cAgnus\u2026\u201d Veron gaped incredulously. He wasn\u2019t hallucinating, but he still couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.Why?\u00a0Why was the Agnus crest inscribed on such a piece of trash?Babel von Agnus? No, not him. He just graduated, and I know his face better than anyone else.Something clicked in Veron\u2019s head: recently, there were rumors shaking Arcadia, if not the entire Empire. It was a hilarious story\u2014a genius for all time, unprecedented in all of history, came into the Agnus house and could manipulate mana at the age of nine.When I first heard it, I assumed it was a ruse devised by the Imperial Family and the Dukes to keep the rise of the Twelve Families under control.\u00a0But it turned out the rumors were true. It was no wonder Mooker was defeated; even if he\u2019d been ten times more careful, Mooker still would\u2019ve lost.\u201cJoshua\u2026 Joshua von Agnus,\u201d Veron mumbled.In the stifling silence, all the children could hear Veron\u2019s words.His rare dark blue hair, his eyes dark like the abyss and wise beyond his year. Standing next to Veron, a reputed nobleman, he seemed to glow. Finally, the deep blue mana coating his long sword.It could not be denied. The rumors around him were not rumors at all.Joshua von Agnus.\u201cDid you say family power trumps everything? Let me ask you\u2026 What do you think my family\u2019s standing is in this school?\u201d\u201cThat- That-\u201d\u201cExcuse me, there must have been a misunderstanding,\u201d said Natasha while Veron was stammering. \u201cIf we had known in advance that the Young Master came from the Agnus family\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up. I didn\u2019t ask you.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014\u201d\u201cThat means don\u2019t interrupt me while I\u2019m talking to this bastard.\u201dNatasha\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment. The dozens of students of various ranks crowding around them made it worse. Joshua spared a glance at the frozen-stiff girl before returning his attention to Veron.\u201cI gave you your chance, Veron shen Villas.\u201d Joshua steadily advanced on Veron, leaving him too afraid to respond. Veron felt like a tiny, powerless critter in front of a wild beast.Joshua had the power to topple dozens of knights at once and a fantastic background as a member of the fame Agnus Duchy. Veron\u2019s towering pride evaporated like a puddle in the sun; all that was left was the fear he\u2019d managed to bury deep inside his heart, erupting out and consuming his body like a flood.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Gehog shouted, but Joshua kept walking. Gehog bit his lip angrily. \u201cWe cannot be treated like this, even if you come from the Agnus house!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018treated like this\u2019?\u201dDamn it.\u00a0Gehog shivered, and he could feel his legs giving out from Joshua\u2019s stare.\u201cWe are the heirs of the Twelve Families! Do you really think that Agnus can just punish us however you want? That\u2019s crossing the line!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Natasha\u2019s face regained its color\u2014she was no longer scared stiff like she was earlier.The other children were of like mind.\u00a0It\u2019s alright.\u00a0No matter how intimidating he was, he was alone. Surely there was no one foolish enough to charge into a battle he\u2019s clearly going to lose.Above all else, this was the heir of Marquis Crombell speaking. They trusted him. After all, the Crombells were on par with the Pontier family, one of the Five Dukes.The children\u2019s faces began to relax.Joshua gasped with laughter.\u201cMistreatment\u2026 Now that I\u2019ve cornered you, you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s \u2018mistreatment\u2019\u2014and you\u2019re even bringing up my father! Is this what you do, Young Master Crombell?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet me ask it the other way around,\u201d Joshua said sarcastically, \u201care you willing to play games with Duke Agnus?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026\u201d Gehog took a step back, suddenly self-conscious.Duke Pontier\u2019s pressure was already a struggle for his family\u2014and Duke Agnus was not the same as Duke Pontier.I can\u2019t lose to the Duke of Agnus in this situation! Our family wouldn\u2019t be able to survive it!\u00a0If he put the family in jeopardy, he\u2019d be disowned in an instant.\u201cI only care about those who picked a fight with my friends,\u201d Joshua said. His voice was low and quiet. \u201cAnyone not involved can leave.\u201dGehog bit his lip.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be my enemy, leave now.\u201dMost of the children present came looking to connect with the Twelve Families; there was no loyalty, and none of them had lofty ambitions.\u201cI think I have an assignment?\u201d\u201cMy parents will be visiting me today, so\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dGehog could only watch and tremble as the crowd dispersed. Joshua waited patiently until only the three from the Twelve Families remained.\u201cRaksha\u2019s name disappears from the Academy today.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\u201cAny objections?\u201d Joshua stared at Gehog, then Veron.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cI ought to teach you a lesson about not thinking nonsense.\u201dFear stained Veron\u2019s eyes behind the slits of his helmet.A young boy\u2019s anguished screams filled the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His silver armor, which used to gleam brilliantly in the sunlight, was battered and dented; the sumptuous crest of feathers were dusty and broken, like the loser of a cock fight.\u201cTake\u00a0it\u00a0away,\u201d Joshua said, staring down at the unconscious body with cold, half-open eyes.\u201cYou\u2014!\u201d Gehog bared his razor-sharp teeth at Joshua as he ran over to Veron. \u201cHelp me right now!\u201d\u201cAh. Yes, I\u2026\u201d Gehog\u2019s scream snapped Natasha out of her daze. She rushed over to Gehog and grabbed Veron\u2019s other arm.Gehog glared at Joshua.\u201cThe heir of Agnus is Babel von Agnus. It won\u2019t change no matter what you do! No matter how talented you are, you\u2019re nothing unless you do something incredible. Today went your way, but the day will come when you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Joshua burst out laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to it. Eventually.\u201d\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d Gehog staggered away. Their confidence and smug posture was gone\u2014not it looked like they struggled with each step forward.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Agareth stared blankly into space. \u201c...Who are you again?\u201d\u201cEveryone has secrets, just like you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Agareth swallowed his words. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dJoshua approached Icarus, who was still on the ground.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d\u201cWere you surprised? I\u2019m not the person you thought I was.\u201d\u201cAs far as that goes, I was expecting it.\u201d Icarus\u2019s response made Joshua\u2019s brow furrow. \u201cI thought it was unusual from the very beginning\u2014why would the son of a fallen aristocrat take the risk of enrolling in the Academy? Everyone knows the Imperial Family doesn\u2019t bother with people that poor. Maybe you came here to find ways to rebuild your family, but it\u2019s unreliable; besides, then you\u2019d be leaving your family to suffer while you live in luxury.\u201dJoshua grinned. Icarus had certainly thought this through.\u201cDid you come here to make connections, like Raksha? That doesn\u2019t make any sense! No one here would pay attention to a fallen noble\u2014I mean, just look at me!\u201cBut all else aside, Young Master Ash is the only\u2014out of a thousand students\u2014sole heir of a fallen nobleman. There\u2019s exceptions to everything. Very few need to conceal their identities.\u201d\u201cI never considered that.\u201d\u201cBut the Young Master seems to overthink things. It appears there are others who are already aware of the Young Master\u2019s identity.\u201d Icarus recalled the brown-haired girl he\u2019d met1.I was expecting this.\u00a0Joshua grinned. Even knowing Joshua\u2019s true identity, Icarus spoke his mind without hesitation. This was the sort of courage Joshua expected from the finest soldiers.\u00a0It\u2019s no wonder he considered fighting a million troops with only ten thousand men.Joshua looked into Icarus\u2019s eyes as he thought. Those signature charming blue eyes, overflowing with courage; despite his severe beating, those eyes never lost their shine. Joshua had a sudden urge to complement Icarus for his lovely, gem-like eyes.\u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d Icarus flushed.\u201cYour eyes\u2026 are lovely.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d The boy\u2019s cheeks went red as a tomato.\u201cBy the way, are you going to keep calling me \u2018Young Master\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWas I the only one who thought we were friends?\u201dIcarus and Agareth offered him a wide-eyed stare.\u201cIt\u2019s not funny for friends to call me \u2018Young Master\u2019.\u201dThe three of them shared a warm smile.The Principality of Thran was a minor kingdom, ruled by a prince rather than a monarch, and had long been a part of the Swallow Empire. Thran was a self-contained state and could fend for themselves without the help of an empire, but the rest of the continent disagreed; Thran\u2019s long association with the Swallow Empire had led to it being regarded as a vassal state.The Prince of Thran had worked for decades to prove that Thran was capable of thriving on its own. He wanted to create a fully independent Thran Kingdom. The Swallow Empire regarded Prince Anthony as a troublemaker, despite its pride; yet, the Prince was known as the \u201cEloquent Magician\u201d for his charm that captured the hearts of the neighboring countries.It got to the point where the Empire couldn\u2019t do anything about it anymore. The charming Prince was free to plot the independence of Thran.But heaven was not always on his side. The Principality of Thran soon encountered a major challenge: Prince Anthony, the icon of chance, suddenly became ill and bedridden.In a bed large enough for ten full-grown men, only a single elderly, ailing man slept peacefully. Several people sat around the bed, wearing solemn expressions. Even as he slept, silent and still as the dead, he was carefully watched over by his subjects.He was the Prince of Thran, Anthony de Val Agretta III.\u201cCan we ease his pain? Is there anything you can do?\u201d A man in his thirties was the first to speak. His eyes flashed with a glowing crimson hue.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 We all need to prepare ourselves now. His Majesty is over seventy years of age; it\u2019s a miracle he survived this long without mana.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d A young woman wept.\u201cHow could there be no way, Priest? If I need to, I\u2019ll bring you a dragon\u2019s heart right now\u2014\u201dThe priest just shook his head.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d The man trudged towards the bed with a pained expression.\u201cUla\u2026bis.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d The man\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYour Majesty, Ulabis is here.\u201d\u201cCome closer\u2026\u201d The Prince\u2019s eyes opened weakly and he gingerly beckoned to the man. \u201cHello\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I have a lot of things to do, but\u2026 I feel so weak\u2026 I just want to rest now.\u201dThe Prince held the man\u2019s hand, and both of them wept. Ulabis struggled to maintain his composure.\u201cThran\u2026 my daughter\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 but as an old man\u2019s dying wish\u2026 please take care of them.\u201dUlabis bit his lip.\u201cThran\u2026 my dear Thran\u2026 I give it to you.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026 me, Your Majesty?\u201dPrince Anthony\u2019s head sank weakly back down.\u201cYour Excellency!\u201dDark clouds hung over the afternoon sky.Year 721. The saint of Thran\u2019s freedom, its ruler, Prince Anthony de Val Agretta III, passed away at the age of 78.I need to prepare to leave as soon as possible.\u00a0Joshua looked back at the Academy building, silhouetted against the sky.I never thought I\u2019d be leaving so soon.\u00a0Joshua chuckled.\u00a0Cain\u2019s going to be surprised.\u00a0The thought of Cain\u2019s confused expression sent Joshua into full-blown laughter.Then he turned and kept walking. There was no point in waiting any longer\u2014he\u2019d completed all of his objectives, and he\u2019d made up his mind to leave.I\u2019ll pack my things and say my goodbyes, and then I\u2019ll go straight to the Imperial Palace.It was obvious after his interaction with Amaru the day before. The reality was, working with a large group of skilled people was far more beneficial than recovering his strength by muddling in the past.Who would\u2019ve guessed that Joshua would achieve far more in this life than in his past life?More importantly, there might be some hidden treasures buried in the Imperial Palace.Joshua halted. While he was walking in a daze, he\u2019d managed to arrive at his destination: his private training area on the outskirts of Arcadia.He couldn\u2019t afford to put it off anymore. Joshua needed to shake the feeling that he\u2019d acquired his new skills by pure chance.But I don\u2019t know how far I can go with a body that just learned the third stage of the Magic Spear Arts.Joshua pushed open the door and his face immediately tensed. Someone he didn\u2019t recognize was laying on the sofa.Is it Cain? No.\u00a0Joshua backed up warily. For the first time since resurrecting, Joshua was nervous. Alarms ran constantly in his head. Even without getting close, he knew that the dirty man on the sofa was dangerous\u2014his colossal presence quietly filled the air.He\u2019s strong.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s anxiety was peaking, and he had to choke down a dry lump.\u201cAh! You\u2019re finally here! I\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing you for a long time.\u201d The man sluggishly pulled himself up and smiled like he was pleased with himself.\u201cAh, you look nice\u2014\u201d He offered Joshua a smile and stood up, stretched, and grinned manically once more. \u201c\u2014Joshua von Agnus.\u201dDuring Joshua\u2019s duel with Amaru.

    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a volcano to the west of the Principality of Thran, famed for its majesty. People across the continent of Igrant were awed by its mere mention.The locals called it the Wolf.Its peak constantly spewed forth lava, drawn from fissures deep in the crust. An enormous vortex of fiery liquid constantly swirled beneath its mouth, the crimson tides threatening to erupt forth at any moment.The Wolf was one of the hottest places on the continent, far too hot for any normal person to enter. The volcano proudly boasted temperatures of roughly one thousand degrees\u2014easily enough to burn a man to death.But somehow, a man walked slowly around the mouth of the volcano; only a few drops of sweat fell from his brow. There was only one explanation: he was a mana wielder\u2014a knight or a wizard. That would allow him to protect his entire body with mana.His name was Ulabis, the blade of Thran, a man who can walk on lava unscathed.\u201cThere\u2019s no time now,\u201d he mumbled, face tense.Only a few people close to the Prince were present when he died. It was only a matter of time before the world found out, though. Rumors spread quickly. The cunning nobles of Swallow would be quick to notice if the Prince fails to appear in public, \u201cdeteriorating health\u201d or not.\u201cThran is like a candle in the wind, without the Prince.\u201d Many claimed to be the center of Thran. Sometimes, Ulabis himself was said to be the center of Thran. Everyone was wrong. The late Prince, Anthony de Val Agretta III was the only man who could claim to be the heart of Thran. Without him, the Principality would have absorbed into the Swallow Empire, and \u201cThran\u201d would vanish from the map.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d Ulabis stared ahead with determination.There was a wall inside the Wolf, at its base. The thing Ulabis was hunting lied at the far end, which opened up like a cave. He\u2019d found it when he\u2019d come here to train\u2014a treasure hidden beneath the raging mountain.Just as people go to the sea to challenge the water pressure, practicing in a place like this where it\u2019s difficult to even breath can massively improve physical ability. However, I can\u2019t be here when the volcano is too active.It was a true life-or-death training regime. In the face of mounting Imperial pressure, Ulabis was desperate to become stronger.There are five Masters of Swallow, just as there are five Masters of Avalon. No, if you count the ones they\u2019ve kept secret\u2026\u00a0Ulabis\u2019s expression darkened. He was well aware that the Swallow Empire\u2019s Masters were not the \u201creal\u201d powers.\u00a0Swallow\u2019s Knights are the strongest by far. Although they are known as the \u201cNorthern Barbarians.\u201dUlabis\u2019s swift footsteps came to a halt. A tunnel loomed, like the jaws of some dark beast. Deep in its darkness shone something bright red.Ulabis had read the ancient texts, and he knew exactly what it was.\u201cPrimordial Stone\u2026 Magma.\u201d Ulabis slowly approached like a man possessed.His mana, imbued with blazing crimson magma, assaulted the Stone.In the depths of the wilderness, brilliant red flames pierced the darkness, lighting up the night.No one should have been here.Who is he, exactly?\u00a0Joshua tensed his muscles, allowing him to move at any time\u2014a sort of battle stance.It made no difference that the other person knew who he was; the problem was that this man was stronger than Joshua. It was the only thing Joshua could think about right now.\u201cAh, those eyes recognize power\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s mouth formed into a lovely curve. \u201cAs expected, you never disappoint me.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cHah! My introduction was indeed late.\u201d The man doffed the hood of his robe, revealing his vivid blue hair and eyes\u2014and the lighting bolts underneath them.\u201cIs that the Steropes mark?\u201d\u201cOh, you recognize it? You deserve a reward?\u201d He clapped his hands in approval.\u201cThe Seven Magicians of the Magic Tower. Everyone knows the Steropes mark, passed from generation to generation of the Thunderbolt seat.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d The man bowed gracefully. \u201cI apologize for the late introduction. Let me introduce myself: Jack Steropes, one of the Seven, and the owner of the Thunderbolt seat.\u201dJoshua was astonished that his hunch turned out to be right.\u201cI don\u2019t care for your like\u2014a Tower running for money, business-like wizards.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 This is suddenly disappointing.\u201d Jack shrugged. \u201cYou understand why I\u2019m here, don\u2019t you?\u201d The Thunderbolt\u2019s voice became frigid. \u201cWhere is Bronto? So long as you tell me where Bronto is, I will not harm you. Well, you know, that thing will rip you to shreds if you play with it. A kid can\u2019t touch that.\u201dEvidently, Jack hadn\u2019t even considered that Joshua had already absorbed Bronto.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again: what do you know about Bronto?\u201d\u201cWizard\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is the place where we should talk about this.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cPlease move.\u201dJoshua\u2019s sudden politeness made Jack grin.\u201cGood. I may talk like an old man, but if you even try acting ignorant, my magic will roast you.\u201dThat was a lot of self-confidence. Regardless, Joshua figured he\u2019d be able to respond to anything Jack did.It\u2019s lucky I\u2019m a child right now.\u201cThis way.\u201d Joshua gestured to the door with a wicked smile.The two departed through the eastern gate and kept walking, following a sparsely populated forest trail for the better part of an hour.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t this place fine? It\u2019s quiet and there\u2019s only the two of us here.\u201d He peered around at the beautiful grass.Joshua abruptly stopped walking.\u201cWell\u2026 I figured this is the best place.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d Jack was puzzled by Joshua\u2019s rapid shift of attitude.\u201cHere, we don\u2019t need to worry about third parties getting hurt.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Jack clutched his head. \u201cWa\u2014kid, you drew me in, for this?\u201d\u201cIn a one-on-one match, I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t lose to a wizard.\u201dJack\u2019s pride as a swordsman was prickled.He\u2019s too arrogant; all he\u2019s done is use mana at a young age. Well, he\u2019s just like a frog in a well.Just a kid. Jack laughed.\u201cSo a weak wizard like me isn\u2019t even worth a punch from the great knights of the Avalon Empire, right?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have any weapons. How do you intend to defeat me?\u201d\u201cYou ask too many unnecessary questions.\u201d Joshua raised his pretty fists, much to Jack\u2019s amusement.\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d\u201cAre you doubting me?\u201dJack sighed dramatically.\u201cNo way.\u201d The man flexed his fingers. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll show you how insignificant a knight is.\u201dNo more waiting\u2014Joshua kicked off the ground and sprinted towards Jack.He\u2019s fast.Jack caught Joshua\u2019s fist, but he didn\u2019t notice the other one already coming for his stomach. He managed to stop both, however.\u201cAre you surprised that a \u2018weak\u2019 wizard is doing this?\u201d Jack smiled slyly at Joshua\u2019s astonished expression. \u201cMy moves might not be as good as a pure physical battle wizard, but I have faith in my abilities. You know what? Haste and Might is too much for your kind.\u201dHaste and Might, spells which improved agility and strength, respectively, were a favorite of lower-class combat mages. When used by a higher ranked mage, their effects were beyond comprehension.\u201cSince I\u2019m done talking, should I start with half-killing you? You\u2019re so confident about your fists.\u201d Jack\u2019s grin widened and he cocked his fist back.Now!Space peeled open behind Jack; something sharp slowly emerged, like a beast hunting its prey.\u201cLugia!\u201dJack turned his head, startled.A horrific shattering sound broke the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat just happened? I couldn\u2019t read his moves!Jack only needed to hear to understand the situation. It was a two-pronged attack, exploiting Jack\u2019s carelessness, but Lugia only cut his robes. Joshua\u2019s eyes were gloomy.\u201cHow dangerous. That might\u2019ve gone through my ribs if I hadn\u2019t heard it.\u201dJack used Blink and reappeared 10 meters away from Joshua.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jack examined Lugia in Joshua\u2019s hands. \u201cAn antique artifact?\u201dLugia was rather lovely, having changed from an iron rod into a spear. Two blades sprouting from a pure white shaft, like a strange sort of fork, but exuding a mystical aura. Most striking was the blood-red blades, which shone so brightly that the light alone could rend flesh.\u201cAn artifact with its own integrated subspace\u2014and quite large, too. Is this the source of your lightning?\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to talk, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. But, you know, I won\u2019t stop until I get what I want. I\u2019m going to start with spiritual magic to pry open your lips.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re planning on using Mind Control\u2026\u201d Mind Control, the highest degree of psychic magic, was only available to wizards of Class 6 or higher. That implied that the man in front of him was one of the most powerful wizards on the entire Igrant continent. The Seven Magicians were no joke.\u201cI\u2019ll have to deal with a little headache, but it\u2019s better than nothing, right?\u201d Jack laughed sullenly.Mental magic, unlike other elemental magics, consumes mental capacity as well as mana. Most wizards disliked that, and most wizards couldn\u2019t use it; mental magic is reserved for the upper castes of wizards, who have prodigious mental abilities.The issue was that any magic that directly affects the brain could destroy the mind of the caster.\u201cLightning Blade.\u201d Jack smirked and casually produced 4th-Level magic with a mere word.The lightning blade flickered with sparks from the ultra\u2013high-voltage current running through his hand.\u201cI won\u2019t murder you. I need information from you, so\u2026 I\u2019ll just use torture. Psychic magic is more effective that way.\u201dJoshua hefted Lugia.Jack wasn\u2019t a battle wizard, but he picked Lighting Blade, a close-combat spell, for a reason: his opponent was a knight with great pride in his abilities. The damned kingdom of Avalon was particularly dismissive of magic, such that wizards were often treated like aliens.An undefeated child genius\u2014what if he loses a close-quarters battle to one of the wizards he looks down on so much?\u00a0The wizard grinned. The mental shock would boost Mind Control\u2019s effectiveness even more.\u201cHooh.\u201d Jack let out a low chuckle.Long ago, Jack got his thrills from crushing people where they were most proud. It seems like old habits die hard.\u201cYou\u2019re too quiet. What else can you show me?\u201dJoshua bit his lip but said nothing.Jack laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing, I\u2019ll move.\u201dAnd then he vanished.Joshua was starting to feel the stress, but his mind was ice-cold.I need to memorize his attack pattern.\u00a0But any unnecessary movements would give the enemy an opportunity.Joshua stabbed his spear to the left.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jack was surprised to find that Joshua had blocked his Lightning Blade, sending a shower of sparks flying in all directions.The wizard vanished again. Joshua thrust\u2014to the right, behind him, above his head. He was beginning to feel hopeful.Lugia\u2019s Lightning Spear, a 3rd-Class spell, causes a series of explosions. Joshua used the effect to strike in front of him.Jack canceled his Lightning Blade and Blinked away.\u201cYou truly are an incredible kid. Instead of avoiding the attack, you took it head-on; some B-Class Knights can\u2019t even take one hit.\u201dJoshua was too focused to listen. He couldn\u2019t afford to relax like Jack did, he needed to be vigilant at all times. A single moment of inattention could decide his fate.Joshua\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cAre you listening now?\u201d Jack\u2019s smile widened. Hundreds of lightning spheres had surrounded them in all directions\u2014there were no holes to escape from.\u201cI suggest you move carefully, because these adorable balls will stun you the moment you touch them. It\u2019s called \u2018Lightning Bolt\u2019, basically a 1st-Class magic. Its effects would be completely different if a wizard from this country casted it. Best avoid it if you don\u2019t want to be completely roasted, boy.\u201dJoshua trembled a little, but examined his surroundings calmly.The man clenched his fists, sending hundreds of lightning spheres on a collision course for the same spot. A bolt of lightning struck the floor, sending sparks in all directions, shaking the very ground and air.\u201cLightning Bolt.\u201d Before the dust settled, Jack formed and detonated hundreds of additional lightning spheres.Joshua emerged from the dust; he was burnt here and there, completely transformed from the neat appearance he had earlier.But, he was still standing.\u201cThis is interesting.\u201dJack pondered using the 5th-Class magic, Thunder Cannon, but shook his head. It wasn\u2019t the right spell for the job; Jack wanted to torture Joshua, not kill him.\u201cRune Flare,\u201d he eventually whispered.Of the four classes of magic, fire magic is regarded as the most destructive.The man fashioned a spear of red-hot flames and laughed.\u201cI could stop this\u2026 Yes, if you beg for forgiveness and admit I\u2019m not \u2018just a wizard.\u2019\u201dThe red light was aimed straight at Joshua\u2019s lower abdomen\u2014where his mana hall would be, if he were a typical knight.Joshua bit his lip as he watched the scarlet flames bearing down on him. Every spell was powerful enough to rattle Joshua\u2019s little body.Dodge?\u00a0Joshua\u2019s young body was too weak to many attacks, much less use attacks of the same level.[What idiocy is this, Joshua?]Lugia?\u00a0His eyes widened.Time stopped. No\u2026 more like it slowed down, as if each second had been divided into ten thousand.[All I see is a pathetic boy who can\u2019t even use his new power.]But the enemy is too powerful![Since when did you care? Your way was always to break through, no matter what stood in your way.]My way\u2026[Even if it leads to your defeat, I\u2019ll always be by your side. So let\u2019s do it. If you do it, Bronto\u2019s power of growth will propel you to new heights.]Lugia\u2019s voice faded away.Joshua made a choice\u2014but first, he had a few hundred lightning spheres to deal with. He swung his spear slowly, creating an infinite number of spears. Or were they shadows? Their continuous motion looked as if they were moving as one.It doesn\u2019t matter who the enemy is. I am Joshua Sanders.His key to win is disguising the spears and striking his opponent when he leasts expects it. Jack can\u2019t banter when he\u2019s fending off spears from in ihs blind spots.Magic Spear Arts, 3rd Class.\u201cAsura\u2019s Path.\u201dHundreds of Lugias embroidered the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of The Unrivaled Spear KnightCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sound of hundreds of lightning spheres bursting at once was overwhelming.Joshua filled Lugia with mana and hurled it at the Rune Flare.Lugia leapt forward, bones cracking. He bit his lips, fighting the pain and focusing on his one and only goal: defeating Jack.Jack was astounded\u2014he\u2019d never imagined Joshua would throw his weapon away. Knights were so proud that losing their weapon was more humiliating than losing their life.It almost looked like the dust was swirling around Joshua, emphasizing his incredible potential.The amazement kept coming. Joshua smashed Jack\u2019s Rune Flare; a weapon should be devoid of mana as soon as it left its wielder\u2019s hand, but Jack could see that the spear seemed to have a mana of its own.The spear punched through the Rune Flare and went speeding towards Jack.\u201cBlink!\u201d Jack reappeared five meters away, only to be greeted by Joshua\u2019s cold eyes. However, his reflexes didn\u2019t fail him. The Thunderbolt seat was clearly not for show.An ominous crackling filled the space between them, itching at Jack\u2019s skin. His eyes, tinged with astonishment, slowly looked downwards.\u201cUgh\u2026 How?\u201dA pure white spear pierced straight through his heart.I still have so many things I wanted to ask him.\u00a0However, his body no longer responded to his will. His knees shook, and he couldn\u2019t feel anything.\u201cHoo\u2014\u201d Jack hacked up bright red blood. His arteries were losing strength; the powerful pumps were slowing. His blood, instead of circulating his body, was gushing out of it.\u201cWhat\u2026 kind\u2026 of\u2026 strength\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Jack weakly reached out and grasped Lugia with both hands.The power of lightning that had been accumulating inside Lugia engulfed Jack\u2019s entire body, turning his body stiff and his eyes dead and gray.The death of Jack Steropes, one of the Seven Magicians and the strongest wizard in the world, famed for his thunder magic, met an unbelievably tragic end.He was too confident. He didn\u2019t pay enough attention.\u00a0Throwing a spear was a simple action, but making a weapon retain mana after it leaves your hand is something only a Master could do. Joshua threw Lugia with all his might, and it flew straight as a laser.The result was decided as soon as Jack used Blink. Joshua\u2019s senses, roused to the extreme, found Jack as soon as he teleported. Lugia retreated to its subspace, and then reemerged to stab their opponent\u2014right where Joshua predicted. Everything went on course, like water running through a river.\u201cKeugh.\u201d Joshua vomited blood. It was pale, dead blood rather than the vivid scarlet Jack had bled. Pushing his body past its limits had left Joshua with grievous internal injuries. The hand holding Lugia in Jack\u2019s heart began to falter.\u00a0I\u2019m losing consciousness.His body gently tilted as he began to lose vision. Joshua knelt down, gripping his bloodstained clothes.Even with his full power, the prowess of the Seven Magicians was not to be taken lightly. The only reason he was alive right now was his combat experience and a healthy dose of luck.Crackle.Brilliant sparks clouded Joshua\u2019s body, cloaking him in a blinding glow as bright as the sun. They came from Lugia\u2014No, they came from Jack Steropes heart, where it was impaled by Lugia.A wizard\u2019s heart stored the essence of their mana; with the wizard dead, the mana in his heart ran amok. Lugia became a conduit, directing the power into Joshua\u2019s body. There was nothing the boy could do as hot sparks assaulted his body. He couldn\u2019t so much as life a finger, he didn\u2019t have the strength.Perhaps I could liken it to sinking into the depths of the ocean? I\u2019m so tired.\u00a0It felt to Joshua like a pair of fat horses was dragging down his eyelids.But it feels like I can\u2019t sleep like this, for some reason. It\u2019s like I\u2019ll sleep forever if I close my eyes now\u2014[The Magic Spear Arts\u2014Quickly!]Who?\u00a0It was like someone was crying out to him, begging him to escape the water. As his consciousness waned, Joshua desperately clung to the small voice like a rope.Lugia?[Use the Arts quickly! Use Bronto\u2026 before it blows up.]If Lugia said anything else, Joshua couldn\u2019t hear them; his mind had only one thought: the Magic Spear Arts. He began to exercise the ancient mana technique with a single-minded determination, as if he\u2019d been possessed.Soon, the earth and sky were bathed in a dazzling white radiance.Among the dozens of instructors gathered in the Academy\u2019s staff meeting room, Kane\u2019s determined expression stood out.An old man, Count Shutein ain Albert, the head of the Academy, checked that everyone was present and opened his mouth.\u201cI apologize for calling such a hasty emergency meeting. We had to hurry because, well, things happened.\u201d\u201cPresident. Is it true that the \u2018issue\u2019 has resulted in student protests?\u201dShutein returned the magic instructor\u2019s question with a nod.\u201cI heard that students from all over the place are protesting at the staff offices.\u201d\u201cIt would be fine if that was it, but there\u2019s rumors that a family is going to request a formal explanation.\u201dThe Count smiled bitterly.\u201cIt has to be one of the Twelve Families.\u201d\u201cThree of the Twelve Families are currently represented in the Academy.\u201dShutein remained silently, cautiously examining the instructors. Most of them had already heard the news and wore troubled expressions, while some were tilting their heads curiously.\u201cPresident\u2026 I\u2026 I haven\u2019t heard some of these rumors yet. Could you please expand?\u201dShutein nodded to the dwarven history instructor.\u201cI, too, would like a more thorough explanation. The subject of the protest, what the students are trying to find out, the cause of the emergency meeting\u2014it\u2019s because of \u2018expedited admission.\u2019\u201dThe magic instructor raised her hand. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been compromised. You know that we can accept students who enroll under a false name to protect their identity? It\u2019s only because the Imperial Family is willing to ignore it,\u201d the President said. \u201cThis time is not like the others. Most students who chose expedited admission came from families who were hesitant to divulge their identity for various reasons. By hiding their family, they avoided issues with existing students. As a result, even if their family was exposed later, most would just close their eyes and move on. There was nothing to be unhappy about because the students didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d\u201cIn other words, the students are demanding the truth, regardless of the consequences.\u201d The magic instructor nodded. \u201cIf this person can exert direct influence on the Imperial Family, they would have to come from the highest ranks of the nobility, or foreign royalty.\u201d\u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d the history instructor asked.The conference room quickly became quiet as a tomb. Several, if not most, already knew, but they were hesitant to say it. No one wanted to provoke that family.\u201cAsh pen Frederick, a student.\u201d Shuten smiled sourly.\u201cNever heard of that family.\u201d The history professor cocked his head thoughtfully.\u201cIt\u2019s a false name. You wouldn\u2019t know them, they were just Viscounts before they fell.\u201dThe history instructor gave him a blank look. \u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cHis real name was\u2026 Joshua. Joshua von Agnus.\u201d\u201cAgnus\u2014!\u201d The instructor looked like he\u2019d been struck by lightning magic. \u201cA-A-A-Agnus?!\u201d His eyes bulged.\u00a0There\u2019s only one family with that name!Duke Aden von Agnus, the pride of the Empire, stands at the forefront of the country, even in the Empire of Knights. A person even the almighty Emperor Marcus has to pay attention to.\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201dThe conference room was quiet enough to hear a pin drop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81No one spoke, despite their surprise. Everyone was too busy staring at each other\u2014no one dared to show their true feelings in this situation.\u201cPresident,\u201d the magic instructor said, 'since the majority of the student body is involved now, it can\u2019t be ignored\u2014even if it involves the son of Duke Agnus.\u201d\u201cI agree,\u201d said a well-dressed middle-aged man, the professor of Imperial Law. \u201cThe environment at the Academy is becoming a little strange. It\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s a fight between the Agnus house and the rest of the students.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The President looked miserable.\u201cIf we let this rift continue as is, even though we know that he was admitted through special means, and continue to ignore the students\u2019 concerns, the Academy\u2019s prestige will plummet. We can\u2019t let that happen, or else\u2026\u201d The Law professor looked frightened. \u201cNext year\u2019s enrollment will be completely empty. There might even be cases where commoners hear the rumors and try to enter the Academy\u2014you see how this will sully our reputation?!\u201dThe President\u2019s frown grew as the teachers debated.Many aristocrats pushed for their children to attend the Academy, regardless of rank or how powerful the Imperial Family was. Shamelessly enough, they expected their children to be treated like treasures. The Emperor may be strong, but the nobility wasn\u2019t weak enough to be ignored; if enough issues piled up, the nobility would lose their mind.Because they\u2019re the children of lesser aristocracy, it will most likely end with a simple protest and a list of demands, especially since the Academy is such an ideal location for socializing and networking. The real problem is\u2026Veron shen Villas, along with the other two from the Twelve Families he considered friends. Count Stein heaved a sigh.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s nothing we can do here,\u201d said a man with a wide temple and small chin\u2014the Etiquette teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way out: the students should be expelled.\u201d\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Kane interrupted, \u201cwhat do you mean \u2018expelled?\u2019 This is school-level discipline; we need to hear the student\u2019s side first before we decide to terminate him. We need to know why he used a false identity!\u201d\u201cWill the other nobility stay silent about this?\u201d\u201cThey\u2014\u201d\u201cIf we leave it alone, you, me, and every noble will be affected\u2014especially us. We are obviously below them, and they will take full advantage of this. Do you honestly think that something like this won\u2019t happen again?\u201dKane could only bite his lip. The Etiquette instructor sighed and turned to the President.\u201cAre we expelling him or not, President? I cannot stress enough how important your decision is. One wrong move could be the catalyst for something enormous; whether good or bad, I cannot say.\u201dThe President was loath to answer. He knew that the Etiquette instructor was the Villas family\u2019s closest friend; that was why he acted so brashly.Baron Chwisegi\u2014It was rumored that Marquis Villas would introduce him to politics. This man has been blinded by power.\u00a0Kane\u2019s expression soured. No one despised this situation more than he did.There were many students whose families wielded significant political power, but many were members of Raksha. The children of the powerless, lower-ranking families, with almost no money or connections, were mocked and bullied at every opportunity. Those students constituted almost 90% of the Academy\u2019s total population.Raksha treated them like objects, dividing the student body into a strict hierarchy, and ruled over them. Several teachers, including Kane, were aware, but chose to remain silent; while they were drowning in what-ifs, their hesitation had allowed the worst to happen\u2014right before their eyes.Shimizu\u2026\u00a0Kane clenched his fists and set his jaw with determination.\u00a0How many times have I wished that I\u2019d done something? Once is enough. A child had to step up because the teachers wouldn\u2019t act. Why expel a child just because they need to save face?Kane didn\u2019t care what family Joshua came from. He was a brave young boy trying to change the Academy.\u201cAre the other teachers in agreement with the Etiquette instructor? Is there anyone who disagrees?\u201dThe other instructors remained silent, making the Etiquette teacher beam.I need to do something, somehow. We can\u2019t let this garbage institution run like this anymore; perhaps the change I wish for will come sooner.\u201cI am of a different mind.\u201d\u201cInstructor Kane?\u201d Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to the swordsman.\u201cDespite rumors of him entering the Academy through an unusual method, there has never been a case where a punishment as harsh as expulsion was imposed without hearing his case\u2014especially not in our Academy, because of our prestige.\u201dThe history professor scratched his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not even\u2014\u201d\u201cMore importantly, I heard that the student revealed his identity after taking part in a stupid fight that even we, the teachers, refuse to talk about. If we were not so ignorant, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue to begin with.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very insensitive, Instructor Kane!\u201d the Etiquette instructor screamed.\u201cOh, were you unaware?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEveryone knows that Raksha is led by three of the Twelve Family\u2019s children. They, even their ancestors, had a long-standing influence on the Academy\u2014they\u2019ve done things, terrible things, that are difficult to even put into words.\u201d\u201cKane!\u201d The Etiquette teacher leapt from his seat. \u201cYou\u2019d best be prepared to take responsibility for your words!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re degrading yourself.\u201d Kane smiled nastily.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI know you still have some shame left in you,\u201d Kane snarled.The Etiquette teacher shivered. Kane was easily the strongest person in the room, whereas the Etiquette instructor was basically ordinary.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for all of us! We\u2019ve lived under pressure, either blinded by power or scared of it. Now our students suffer for it.\u201d Kane glared around the room. \u201cHow long will you choose silence?\u201dOnly the Etiquette teacher looked up. The President hastily tried to fix the awkward atmosphere, but someone\u2019s voice interrupted him from outside the door.\u201cWith that said, I concur.\u201d\u201cYou are\u2014\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d Joshua gently cracked his eyes open. Despite the screaming pain coming from every bone in his body, his soul was incredibly renewed.Joshua gingerly stood up and immediately flinched.\u201cJack Steropes\u2026\u201d All that was left was an unidentifiable lump of charcoal.I defeated one of the Seven Magicians\u2014with this body.\u00a0Only a Master could take on one of the Seven, no matter how low-ranked they were.Well, the wizards were more afraid of the Masters in a war.\u201cBy the way, this ache\u2026\u201d\u00a0Is it joint pain, or muscle pain?[It\u2019s growing pains, right?]\u201cLugia?\u201d[Doesn\u2019t it seem like your eyes are a little higher?]\u201cCome to think of it\u2026\u201d Joshua examined his body; his clothing was burnt and torn, but one thing was evident. \u201cAre my clothes\u2026 smaller?\u201d[It\u2019s not that your clothes have shrunk, your body has grown.]It was just as Lugia said\u2014he didn\u2019t suddenly develop an adult body, but there was a visible difference.Joshua paused. \u201c...Perhaps Bronto\u2019s other skill is \u2018growth?\u2019\u201d[Yes. We didn\u2019t anticipate this\u2026 The Primordial Stone\u2019s power seems to have accelerated your growth. At this rate, it won\u2019t be long until you\u2019re fully grown!][Well, not to say you\u2019re going to become a rickey old geezer. Bronto\u2019s growth power is focused on constructing a physique that will allow the user to employ their full potential.]\u201cHow did this happen in the first place?\u201d Joshua mumbled.[Five years.]\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d[Your body will be fully developed in five years. You need to focus on balancing your body while it grows.][One more thing!]Lugia\u2019s form rose and approached him, bathing Joshua\u2019s surroundings in a pure white light.\u201cYou\u2014!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His mouth curved into a delicate grin, and his eyes looked like they were just two lines drawn on his face.No one recognized the man; he looked like someone else. Only people who had met him personally would recognize his visage.\u201cCount Sten?\u201d The astonished mutter of the history professor was loud in the silent conference room.The head of the prestigious Sten house, one of the Empire\u2019s five Masters\u2014Arie bron Sten.There were additional footsteps coming from behind Count Sten. The Etiquette teacher only shifted his attention away from the Count\u2019s enormous presence by accident.\u201cAh!\u201d His voice was laced with awe and delight. \u201cDuke Agnus?!\u201dBefore the mystified gazes of the teachers, a being greater than even Count Sten, the brilliant star of the Empire, Duke Aden von Agnus, slowly entered the conference room.The bright light fades away. Lugia still floats in the air; now, it has a distinct scarlet diamond at the joint between shaft and blade.Joshua stared at it, like the sparkling crystal had hypnotized him.[I suppose what happened is that Bronto appears to have consumed the power of his own kind and awakened a lost power. It\u2019s also possible that your unexpected growth has something to do with it.]\u201cThen this\u2014\u201d[Yes. You could call it Bronto\u2019s crystal. Capturing the Primordial Stone, a heavenly object, with a mundane human body is nigh-impossible\u2014so I used my strength to remove a portion of it. Well, thanks to that, your curse was lifted. You\u2019d have to become a Master otherwise, so you\u2019d better be grateful.]\u201cYou really did that?\u201dJoshua\u2019s expression hardened. Cause and effect; there was no great power without a price, just as there would be a wonderful fruit at the end of trial and tribulation. Lugia, by her own words, was a demonic artifact\u2014the devil\u2019s weapon, to put it another way. Joshua couldn\u2019t imagine something like that would provide its assistance for free.[Are you sure you won\u2019t regret it?]\u201cWhat?\u201d Joshua frowned.[My identity\u2014Are you confident you can bear the weight?]Joshua didn\u2019t need to think about it for long.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether I can or can\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to use you anymore if you don\u2019t answer.\u201d[You\u2019re not going to use me?]Joshua nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t need a monster with unclear goals. I know your power comes with a price.\u201d[Haha! You\u2019re exactly the kind of person who would repay favors even to his enemies.] Lugia fluttered in front of Joshua, who stared at the spear with his mouth firmly shut.[If you\u2019re really interested, I\u2019ll tell you: this body is\u2026.] Lugia paused dramatically, causing Joshua\u2019s face to tense. [...Lord Lugia! The best and most beautiful artifact in the whole universe!]\u201cYep\u2026 I should probably throw you away.\u201d[It makes no difference whether you use me or not; the contract has already been signed.]\u201cWe most certainly have not signed a contract.\u201d Joshua tilted his head. \u201cA contract that I don\u2019t know about? Are you insane?\u201d[No, it\u2019s definitely a contract you\u2019re familiar with. It couldn\u2019t be fulfilled without your consent.] Lugia gently dropped to the ground, peering at Joshua.[What is this\u2014you\u2019re still unsure? Yes, the contract has already been signed. It was signed the moment you went back in time.]\u201cHey, you\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat is Duke Agnus thinking?\u201d the President mumbled.\u201cWhen his child does something wrong, isn\u2019t it just polite for the father to come and visit?\u201d Duke Agnus smiled warmly.\u201cD-Duke,\u201d the President stammered, \u201cI apologize; I will watch my tongue.\u201d\u201cNo worry.\u201d The Duke shook his head. \u201cThis is a precious center of learning. This is the place where the future rulers of the Empire are taught, and nowhere else. This is the place where I want my child to be disciplined, more or less.\u201d\u201cA punishment\u2026 No, it\u2019s not even worth the trouble.\u201d The history teacher shook his head urgently.\u201cNo, hasty admittance is unquestionably wrong, regardless of the cause,\u201d Count Sten replied. He smiled heartily and turned to the Etiquette teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s that right, Chwisegi?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Despite Count Sten\u2019s borderline insulting statements, the Etiquette teacher was unable to answer. The moment he met Count Sten\u2019s narrow eyes, his body stiffened like a rat in front of a viper.\u201cStop it, Arie.\u201d Duke Agnus heaved a sigh and Count Sten shrugged. \u201cNow, as you may have suspected, I\u2019m here to help my son with his troubles.\u201d\u201c...Are you saying that, with the Duke\u2019s power, you\u2019ll turn this expedited admission into a no-go?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d\u201cMy name is Cecil, the professor of Magic at the Avalon Empire Academy.\u201d Cecil stood up boldly, much to the surprise of her colleagues. \u201cYou said it yourself: this is a place of learning, the cradle of the future of the Empire.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201dCecil was startled by Duke Agnus\u2019s quick reply and needed to take a long breath.\u201cAs you said, this is a place where the children can make a place for themselves. The mere presence of an adult, even Duke Agnus, will have adverse effects on them; they have no choice but to be influenced, knowingly or not.\u201cHowever, there\u2019s nothing I can say if you came here as a parent to deal with your child\u2019s issue. Due to the nature of expedited admission, I believe it is not the responsibility of that particular student.\u201dCan a student really go through expedited admission without help?Cecil\u2019s words were nothing short of a direct reproach. The highest noble in the Empire, the second most powerful man in the Empire, versus an Academy teacher. She was nothing more than a baroness. The Academy staff were losing their minds.She may be accounting for the Imperial Family\u2019s backing, but her actions were driven more by her strict adherence to her principles than logic. It made Duke Agnus smile.\u201cI agree as well,\u201d said the Etiquette teacher, having gathered his courage. \u201cWell, there\u2019s only one decision we can make when someone like Duke Agnus appears in a place like this, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cYou kept your mouth shut even when the Raksha circle acted worse than thugs, you\u00a0rat.\u201d Count Sten scowled at the Etiquette teacher.His voice was quiet, but it reached the Etiquette instructor\u2019s ears clearly. No, everyone heard it\u2014the conference room they were trapped in was very quiet. The staff blushed in embarrassment, or reddened in anger. Kane was one of the former, the Etiquette teacher belonged in the latter.\u201cYou appear to be misunderstanding something,\u201d Duke Agnus said. \u201cThere are two reasons why I came here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFor starters, I\u2019d like to apologize for my son\u2019s treatment of this friend.\u201d Duke Agnus gestured to Count Sten. \u201cWhen I spoke to the Stens, they said that they already knew about this rift. I was in a rush, wondering if the bastard had lost his mind and did something inappropriate to his acquaintance.\u201d\u201cDuke, I haven\u2019t forgiven him yet, to be sure.\u201d Count Sten smiled. His narrow eyes widened. \u201cIf you can\u2019t back up your words\u2014\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be worried about that. You\u2019ll be surprised.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Count Sten smiled pleasantly again.\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201dThe staff gulped nervously.\u00a0What words will that mouth utter?\u201cI want to warn you that if expedited admission becomes a problem big enough to affect the entire Academy, Joshua could face severe consequences\u2014including expulsion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Agareth saw a boy approaching him and halted. It was his old best friend, the boy with light gray hair and slit-like eyes. Agareth flinched and stared down at his feet.\u201cAre you going to flee once more?\u201d Amaru held his arm up to stop him.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI asked you if you\u2019re going to run away again. If you let this continue, that child, like your older brother Shimizu, will be expelled. You know that, right? Even if he\u2019s Duke Aden von Agnus\u2019s child.\u201d Amaru stared at Agareth. \u201cNo matter how pathetic you are, you have a choice not to make the same mistake again. Besides, you and that kid are the only reason he had to reveal his identity early, right? You need to repay that kindness\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2014!\u201d Agareth bit his lip.\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cCan you imagine how I felt when my older brother was expelled from the Academy for his horrible acts?\u201d Agareth shouted angrily. \u201cDo you realize what sacrifices I had to make for him? Me! I wanted to just run away and hide\u2014but I can\u2019t, because of him! Everytime I look into his eyes, I wish they were gone.\u201d\u201cHow many older brothers push their younger brothers to take the lead?\u201d Amaru shook his head. \u201cI think there are few. Our society pushes them to do it. We live in a place where we kill or die just to achieve\u2014that\u2019s the fucking society we live in.\u201d He smiled bitterly. \u201cMy brother felt the same way. He saw me as a threat because I had a little talent; he didn\u2019t hesitate to hurt me any way he could. It\u2019s been so long that I can\u2019t recall a single happy memory of my family.\u201cBut you know, your brother is different. It irritated me\u2014I was envious.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0Have you ever been envious of someone?\u00a0The Amaru bron Sten, the proud, was envious?\u201cYou know, some people might not love you even if you\u2019re brothers. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that not everyone is like Shimizu kun Douglas. His body may be crippled, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s worried about you even though he\u2019s pushing you to keep studying. He\u2019s worried that what happened to him will happen to you, too.\u201d Amaru\u2019s eyes glowed. \u201cHaving such an admirable older brother makes you an enviable man.\u201dAmaru slowly began to walk away.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want anyone to sully his image anymore, isn\u2019t it your turn to defend him? Your friend Ash\u2014no, Joshua von Agnus.\u201d\u201c...friend.\u201d Agareth stared at Amaru\u2019s departing back for a long minute.Agareth took off running with a sparkle in his eyes.On a flat, barren plain stood six towers of the same height. At their center was an ivory tower, half again as tall as the other six, extending straight into the sky. In the top of that tower, a menacing collection of six people sat at a round table. They sat in silence, examining each other.There should have been seven of them.\u201cYou\u2019re well aware that something appears to have gone wrong with Jack,\u201d said Ian, the highest-ranked magician. He pointed to the vacant Thunderbolt seat.All of the seats, except the Master\u2019s seat, had fist-sized orbs atop them. These orbs, dubbed \u201cBio-Reaction Orbs\u201d were one of the Magic Towers\u2019s creations. They were linked directly to the body of each of the Seven Magicians. The Master of the Tower designed the orb to fulfill many functions, but there was one function of particular importance\u2014a sort of safety device, allowing them to quickly respond to emergencies.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the lightning\u2019s force has waned\u2014it\u2019s gone blank, like it\u2019s vanished entirely. The Master is correct,\u201d Marcus, the Earth Magician stated. Indeed, the Thunderbolt Orb was a dull gray color. \u201cUnless he had a change of heart and did something foolish again.\u201d\u201cI must say my part as well. Perhaps he mastered a skill that can overpower the Master of the Tower, but,\u201d the Ice Magician, Elisha, shook her head, \u201cit\u2019s more likely he did something stupid and got himself killed.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way he could have surpassed the Master.\u201d Theta, the Storm Magician, shook his head as well. \u201cHe\u2019s weaker than me and only recently reached Sixth Class last year. I agree\u2014he\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cI will adjourn this meeting,\u201d Ian declared. \u201cFor now, the Magic Tower will enact our emergency protocols. Halt all of your work and focus on finding anything regarding Jack\u2014dead or alive.\u201d Ian glanced around and stood. \u201cI want to remind you that our enemy\u2014or Jack\u2019s enemy, at least\u2014is still unknown. If you find out whether they\u2019re alone or working in a group, report it immediately. Refrain from reaching beyond your means; you\u2019ll end up like Jack if you insist on carrying your pride around.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lord.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, we must consider the Avalon Empire. The Agnus duchy had to be Jack\u2019s last destination.\u201dMarcus and Theta were the first to leave; eventually, there was only one person left at the top of the tower.The one and only magician of the void\u2019s eyes twinkled from beneath the shade of his robe.\u201cDuke Agnus, I had no idea you\u2019d suggest they expel your child from school. Well, it certainly made things interesting. Everyone seemed so surprised that they could burst.\u201d Count Sten laughed at the memory, and Duke Agnus joined him shortly.\u201cWhat were you going to do if they really did expel him? He\u2019s the Duke\u2019s son, but not the Duchess\u2019s; since you\u2019re here frequently, you can\u2019t protect him if he goes back to the duchy\u2014\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t return to the duchy.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard the Emperor has issued a proclamation for him to join the Knights Templar.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty?\u201d Count Sten was astonished.\u201cHe appears to be greatly talented. The Imperial Family has been chasing after that boy for quite some time now.\u201d\u201cTalent isn\u2019t everything.\u201d Count Sten shrugged. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t deny that it was his talent that has the Imperial Family so excited. His Majesty wouldn\u2019t have bothered if Joshua was a useless bastard.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Duke Agnus said. \u201cI understand His Majesty the Emperor has given us orders to travel to the Swallow Empire.\u201d\u201cWill you go?\u201d Count Sten grinned back at him. \u201cAs His Majesty\u2019s instructions, this task is vital. However, I will not be affected even if my family\u2019s swordsmanship is neglected and I, as head of the household, refuse to act.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Duke Agnus groaned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, even if we delay, there\u2019s still plenty of time. The Duke must have heard of the recent changes here, right?\u201d\u201cHahh.\u201d\u201cStartling news from Swallow! They dispatched the haughty Master Duke Altsma and 200,000 soldiers to Thran shortly after they learned of the death of the Prince. However,\u201d Count Sten added with a smirk, \u201ccontrary to expectations, losing their leader had not left Thran as defenseless as they thought. The Swallow Empire suffered a great setback. They were too cocky\u2014they lost half of their soldiers and their leader, Duke Altsma, was gravely wounded.\u201dThe Swallow Empire, one of the continent\u2019s three major powers, had broken the peace they were enjoying. It may have been treated as a civil war because the Principality of Thran was considered a vassal of Swallow, but that was not the point.The Swallow Empire, in all of its immense power, had been defeated. That was the only thing the other countries cared about.\u201cIt\u2019s commonly said that a siege requires at least three times the number of defenders. But that fortress was guarded by only 50,000 men\u2014Swallow had four times their numbers. I had doubts that Swallow would have even bothered launching an attack.\u201cHowever, the tales are true. For the time being, His Majesty will be keeping a close eye on the situation.\u201dDuke Agnus grimaced. \u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s thinking. War is a game of numbers. It\u2019s more interesting if Thran has good strategists and tacticians, but Swallow has Duke Altsma in command. You know how powerful a single Master can be.\u201d\u201cNaturally, I\u2019m well aware.\u201d\u201cThe only thing that can defeat a Master is another Master\u2014but there\u2019s no Master in Thran. The Swallow Empire made sure of that.\u201d Duke Agnus grimaced even more. \u201cHopefully, a hidden talent has emerged\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201d Count Sten shook his head. \u201cThe one who defeated Duke Altsma is someone we know.\u201d\u201cIs that true? He\u2019s been a Master for over a decade. Are you sure he\u2019s not from another country?\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s from Thran.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cHah. Someone from Thran, close to its ruler\u2014there\u2019s only one person, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201c...Ulabis,\u201d Duke Agnus whispered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84The Emperor of Swallow, Verona belle Grace, pondered quietly on his throne. He didn\u2019t show it, but his mood was foul.Finally, he broke the eerie silence:\u201cDuke Altmsa\u2014you say he sustained major injuries?\u201d\u201cHis wounds didn\u2019t appear severe. But, for many days now, he\u2019s been staring into space and crying. As best as I can tell, he\u2019s been psychologically traumatized.\u201d Gandar, the sage and prime minister of Swallow, had visited Duke Altsma on behalf of the Emperor.\u201cI\u2019ll visit him myself,\u201d Emperor Veron said with a bitter smile. \u201cI will provide our comrade the support he needs.\u201d\u201cBut Your Majesty! He\u2019s just a soldier like everyone else! He lost over half of our forces in a single day and had the gall to come back alive\u2014what kind of leader is he?!\u201d This came from one of Duke Atlsma\u2019s long-time rivals, his bald head winking in the sunlight.\u201cThe Duke is right, Your Majesty! In times like this, he should be punished, not consoled. He is shameful and needs to be disciplined,\u201d Duke Albert van Momori shouted, stepping forward. He was another of Swallow's Masters, as well as Duke Altsma\u2019s rival.\u201cIf he acted rationally, this could never have happened! Were it not for his pride, our Empire would not have suffered this defeat. He could have resolved it in a duel with the enemy\u2019s commander before it devolved into a full-fledged war.\u201d\u201cOr, even if he didn\u2019t stop to think about it, our troops massively outnumbered the Principality. But he went in recklessly and lost immediately. Our men\u2019s morale is in shambles.\u201dEven Emperor Verona, with his saint-like temperance, could not help but sigh. He knew their true desires.Even when the Empire is damaged, they can\u2019t set aside their selfishness. They just want to take down Duke Altsma.\u00a0The Emperor shook his head with a sour smile.\u00a0Why do I always think of\u00a0him\u00a0when something happens?\u201cBrother Demero\u2026\u201d Veron idly gazed out the window.\u00a0Even now, you\u2019re still the Splendor of the Empire.\u00a0Charismatic or not, he was fit to be the Emperor.\u201cThe failure of our soldiers was not Duke Atlsma\u2019s fault,\u201d the Emperor told his vassals. \u201cWho could have guessed that the Principality had someone who could take on an entire army?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is right.\u201d\u201cOur lack of knowledge is the leading reason why we lost. We assumed that Thran did not have a Master.\u201d The Emperor looked his vassals straight in the eyes. \u201cI believe, in times like these, it is important for everyone to work together to find ways to win the coming wars, rather than seek methods to punish someone they think caused the failure to begin with.\u201d\u201cI most definitely agree with His Majesty.\u201d Prime Minister Gandar nodded with a smile.\u201cThen\u2026 I propose we should send more soldiers and at least two superior Masters with them,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cIt will be a sure victory; if Your Majesty agrees, I will take charge.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d The Prime Minister shook his head coldly.\u201cWhat are you saying, Prime Minister?\u201d\u201cThis attack was our preemptive strike, taking advantage of the chaos caused by the Prince\u2019s death. What if we succeeded and wiped out the Principality? All eyes will be on us\u2014we wouldn\u2019t be able to make a move.\u201d\u201cRight\u2014\u201d\u201cSurely,\u201d Gandar interrupted Duke Momori, \u201cthe Duke is not thinking the same thing as Duke Altsma?\u201d The Duke broke into a cold sweat.\u201cAm I wrong? Too much pride is the bane of a knight.\u201d The Prime Minister Gandar turned away with a small smile. \u201cSir, it is my opinion that, for the time being, it is best to only monitor the situation. There will be other opportunities in the future.\u201d\u201cIf the Prime Minister thinks this way, then so be it. Does anyone object?\u201dThere was no reply, and Emperor Verona nodded conclusively.\u201cHow was the situation in Thran?\u201d he asked.The Prime Minister\u2019s face stiffened. \u201cThey believe that our preemptive strike was unethical and disrupted the peace on the continent. This places us in a situation where we have to be wary of our neighbors.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s also the reason for this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Gandar nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s called Ulabis. He brought Duke Altsma to his knees without mercy. His tremendous power has earned him the title \u2018Knight of the Red Flame,\u2019 and he\u2019s well versed in literature and martial arts.\u201d\u201cI heard that when he strikes, the ground splits open and spits sparks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a legendary magic swordsman, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThis bodes poorly for us.\u201dAbruptly, the courtroom doors slammed open. Someone ran inside and prostrated himself before the Emperor.\u201cA messenger?\u201dGandar noticed the red flag on the messenger\u2019s back, indicating that he carried urgent information.\u201cYour Majesty! Please forgive my rudeness!\u201d The messenger took a quick breath and kept speaking. \u201cThe future Prince of Thran has been announced!\u201dVerona and Gandhar burst out laughing\u2014then they realized it wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis is insane!\u201d\u201cThran is our vassal! How dare they do this without permission!\u201dThe court erupted into rage. By custom, the reigning Prince would travel to the Imperial Palace of Swallow to pay their respects and inform the Emperor of who would take the throne of Thran. This practice\u2014known as the Oath of Allegiance\u2014was a long-standing custom. It may have been dishonorable from Thran\u2019s perspective, but Swallow saw it as the natural order.\u201cMaybe they did this because of their damned independence movements.\u201d\u201cWho do you think it is?\u201d Verona asked.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s to say who will take the throne?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe messenger swallowed nervously. \u201cThe 17th Prince of Thran, succeeding Anthony de val Agreta III, to marry his daughter, is the Knight Ulabis. It is said he will take the Agreta name.\u201dThe court was plunged into stifling silence.Demon Lugia.\u00a0In the end, Lugia hadn\u2019t given him any more information. All he knew was that his miraculous regression was somehow linked to Lugia. But Joshua couldn\u2019t deny it anymore\u2014Lugia was literally the devil\u2019s weapon.Was it actually sleeping, or was it just pretending? Joshua eyed Lugia, strapped to his back in its iron rod form.Demons, or evil spirits: a deity with a greater ability in combat than any other species. It was well known that the top hundred demons were enormously powerful, and could even summon dragons to aid them in battle. The eight demon kings were godlike, and could challenge an elder dragon. A demon even stronger than the demon kings would be a match for a Dragon Lord.It\u2019s not a god for no reason. What else but a god could explain such a miracle?Joshua abruptly stopped. He\u2019d arrived at his destination, but found a crowd bunched up around the Academy entrance.\u201cOh, there he is!\u201dJoshua unconsciously stepped back as the children raced over to him.\u201cAgareth\u2026 and Icarus?\u201d\u201cWhy are you always so late? The school is in complete chaos because of you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cSurely you didn\u2019t expect this, as the son of a Duke? Do you even remember when you said \u2018to my friends\u2019?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Young Master Joshua can\u2019t do that.\u201d Icarus smirked along with Agareth.\u201cThis is rather\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is what, exactly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to run away anymore,\u201d Agareth said, looking Joshua dead in the eyes. \u201cAll the students here are assembled to protest the school\u2019s disciplinary action against you.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Agareth worked hard,\u201d Icarus added. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to gather these students.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Everyone was thinking the same thing.\u201d Agareth grinned. \u201cYou said the Academy is a place the students make for themselves; that\u2019s why you say they should listen to themselves as much as possible, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just a flimsy excuse. In front of Duke Agnus, you wouldn\u2019t be able to say you\u2019re going to do whatever you want,\u201d Icarus interjected, shaking his head.\u201cWe\u2019re going to file a petition opposing your disciplinary actions. There are roughly a hundred people in the opposition\u2014those who are demanding disciplinary action. It\u2019s impossible for them. We have far more than a few hundred people.\u201dAgareth cocked his head at Joshua, who had yet to speak.\u201cYou weren\u2019t blown away, were you?\u201d\u201cLet me wipe the tears away.\u201d Icarus patted his cheek.Joshua finally broke into a soft smile, warm as the brilliant sun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them was the President; the other was the Etiquette teacher, with his mouselike, triangular face.\u201cPresident, are you sure you don\u2019t want him out of the Academy?\u201d The teacher seemed frustrated.\u201cHe\u2014\u201d\u201cEven if he\u2019s Duke Agnus\u2019s, he\u2019s up against three families! Furthermore, Marquis Villas and Marquis Crombell. Between them they control half the Empire.\u201d The Etiquette teacher became more and more agitated. \u201cLife is a series of decisions! You have to be alert and focused at times like these\u2014do you understand that these choices will shape the rest of your life?!\u201dSuddenly, his voice became low and serious.\u201cToday\u2026 Central politics have a lot of potential if managed properly, especially if you\u2019re in the right position. For instance: you, President, have the potential to be Prime Minister. I strongly advise you to pursue the position.\u201d\u201cDid Marquis Villas say that?\u201d The President\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cDon\u2019t fret. It\u2019s not just the Marquis Villas. Marquis Crombell also said he\u2019d support you; both of them wish you luck.\u201d\u201cWhy are they\u2026\u201d The President was dumbfounded.\u201cAre you talking about Marquis Villas? He\u2019s a military commander, so it\u2019s not impossible\u2014but the military holds a greater regard for people, you know.\u201dIt wasn't just the warriors. All of Avalon\u2019s knights admired him as a role model.It\u2019s no good if they\u2019re envious or jealous.\u00a0The President grumbled to himself.\u00a0Someone whose cup was never full\u2026\u201cWhat made Marquis Crombell say such a thing?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026\u201d The teacher cautiously peeked around and leaned in. \u201cDid you hear that Marquis Crombell and Duke Pontier\u2019s trade war has escalated into physical violence?\u201dThe President gave him a tiny nod.It wasn\u2019t a little war between lords in the countryside, as sometimes happened. It was a battle between two powerful families\u2014the most prestigious, some might say. It was an event big enough that most of the nobles of Avalon already knew.\u201cWith rumors spreading that the Mercenary King has thrown in with Marquis Crombell, everyone expected his victory would come shortly. I thought the same thing: the only difference between them is their titles; the two families split the Empire's commerce almost perfectly in half.\u201d\u201cWere the rumors true?\u201d The President\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief. \u201cWhat does His Majesty say about this?\u201dTechnically, the Mercenary King was an outsider here. In the larger context of the Avalon Empire, he was an obvious stranger\u2014not a member of the feuding families. Is the Emperor supposed to sit idle while an outsider intervenes in the affairs of his vassals?\u201cHow could such a moron comprehend the profundity of His Majesty\u2019s words? I\u2019m sure everyone thinks the same,\u201d the teacher assured him. \u201cThe important thing is that His Majesty has no intention of interfering despite the Mercenary King\u2019s involvement.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d The President sighed deeply.\u201cAnyways, it was reported that Duke Pontier sent Princess Charles directly to Duke Agnus some time ago.\u201d\u201cHow does that make sense?\u201dThe Etiquette teacher nodded. \u201cIn this critical time, he risked everything by sending his daughter to Agnus. Isn\u2019t the reason obvious?\u201d\u201cHe sought assistance from Duke Agnus?\u201d\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he did. They\u2019ve been close for quite some time now.\u201dThe President silently pondered the Etiquette teacher\u2019s remarks.\u201cIf you have any more concerns, just leave it to me. More than a hundred students have already filed a complaint; if you try and use that as an excuse\u2014\u201d\u201cPre-President!\u201d The door burst open and man dashed inside.The Etiquette instructor scowled at the man, while the President eyed him intently.\u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d\u201cYou need to see this! Hundreds of students are protesting outside! Also\u2014\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say we don\u2019t need to do anything?\u201d The Etiquette teacher smiled slyly and shrugged. \u201cThe students will do it for us: by eliminating the \u2018evil\u2019 Joshua von Agnus, the Academy\u2019s \u2018justice\u2019 will be restored.\u201d He burst into laughter.\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d The man cautiously interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 the opposite.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The Etiquette teacher bent his head at him.\u201cThey\u2019re protesting against Raksha, not to have Joshua von Agnus disciplined.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The teacher leapt from his seat.\u201cLet\u2019s go see,\u201d the President said.The other two men followed him out the door.\u201cThis is the voice of the students! Former and present! We are against Joshua von Agnus\u2019s punishment!\u201d\u201cDissolve Raksh! They\u2019ve tormented the students for too long! They\u2019re evil and vile!\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t their plaything!\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026?\u201d The President boggled at the hundreds of students gathered in front of the entrance.\u201cThose scumbags\u2014!\u201d The voice startled the President. He turned his head to see the Etiquette teacher marching towards the children with a monstrous expression.\u201cDo you still call yourselves the children of nobility?!\u201d The teacher\u2019s voice silenced the crowd for a moment. His face was flushed with growing excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but expedited admission.\u201d One of the children mustered enough courage to step forward. \u201cIf it were me, I wouldn\u2019t be offended by such a favor\u2014I\u2019m a high ranking noble!\u201dIt was Agareth. His customary bumbling demeanor was gone, replaced with sharp, bright eyes.\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019d like to ask the instructor something.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The Etiquette instructor threw him a disgusted look.\u201cYou call yourself a teacher\u2014but can you honestly call yourself a proud nobleman of the Avalon Empire?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSome of the students established a group called Raksha and proceeded to harass the lower-class students of the Academy. Actually, no. Can we even call it harassment? They paralyzed my only sibling and had him expelled from the Academy. You watched it unfold before your very eyes, and no one, not even you, took action. You just watched while a child\u2019s life was irreparably ruined.\u201d\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d The Etiquette teacher seemed to be scrabbling for what\u2019s left of his pride.\u201cDo you seriously believe that?\u201d\u201cOf course it was an accident! You may be nobles, but you\u2019re still kids! Accidents happen when you play!\u201dAgareth almost exploded when the teacher started making excuses, but he managed to keep it down.\u201cIf you\u2019re so sure that Raksha has been bullying your classmates all this time, then give me some tangible proof! You kids are so shameless, to be saying that sort of thing without basis. We are not joking here, kids.\u201d\u201cThere is no proof, but there are witnesses.\u201dThe Etiquette teacher whirled around. \u201cInstructor Kane?\u201dKane stared coldly down at the other teacher, looming over him with his muscle figure.\u201cI am the witness.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cApologies.\u201d Kane bowed deeply to Agareth, to his amazement. \u201cI know what happened to your brother. The mastermind\u2026 I knew it all. Shimizu asked me for help.\u201dNothing compared to how shocked Agareth was now.\u201cI was terrified. As a teacher, I should have acted\u2014but I couldn\u2019t. My safety was more important to me. I\u2019m ashamed. I feel like an idiot, thinking about it now. I ignored it and it just got worse.\u201d Kane turned to face the President. \u201cPresident, I will resign as swordsmanship instructor after this.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d A teacher\u2019s position at the Imperial Academy was not a light thing. Many low-ranking nobles with no connections ascended in the political world through the Academy. It was a place for networking for students and teachers.\u201cYou\u2019re such a hypocrite\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Kane rounded on the Etiquette teacher.\u201cInstructor Kane: you are a hypocrite. Do you think this is going to ease your conscience?\u201d The teacher smiled. \u201cThe kid who asked for help got thrown away, and now you\u2019re coming clean. I\u2019m getting tired of this. I want no part of such hypocrisy. You need to face reality.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kane murmured.\u201cI think I\u2019m going to get sick. This place stinks of garbage.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWh-wh-what?\u201d The Etiquette teacher flinched. A boy had pushed his way out of the crowd to stand in front of him. \u201cJo\u2014Joshua von Agnus.\u201d\u201cAs you wish, I will take personal responsibility for my expedient admission. However\u2026\u201d Joshua offered him a cold smile. \u201cBefore you go, make sure you clean up the trash. As a descendant of the great Agnus family, I don\u2019t want the future rulers of the Empire to be sullied by such filth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it weren\u2019t for these meddling kids, that Agnus brat would\u2019ve been kicked out of the premises before the teacher could even blink. Those children from the poor households should\u2019ve been too scared to speak up, but instead circumstances had pushed the Etiquette teacher onto the stage.God dammit.\u00a0He bit his lips.\u00a0I finally learned something about this Joshua boy.In his rather late introduction, he\u2019d been revealed as the second son of Duke Aden von Agnus. Crucially he was not the legal child of Duchess Vanessa; the fact the Duke Agnus, who shared his father\u2019s demeanor, had taken a concubine\u2014a maid, no less\u2014had already spread across Arcadia.I only have one choice now\u2014the most dependable, straightforward method.\u00a0Chwisegi, the Etiquette teacher, raised his head and scowled at Joshua.\u00a0I did my part, even though it went downhill very quickly. Now the rest is up to the Twelve Families.Just as he was about to speak up, a group emerged from behind him.\u201cJoshua von Agnus!\u201dThe Etiquette teacher whipped around, and found a boy and a girl leading hundreds of children\u2014the members of Raksha, without a doubt.\u201cYou\u2019re not satisfied with merciless violence against your classmates\u2014now you besmirch academics in the name of your family?\u201dJoshua peered at the boy\u2014it was Gehog, the heir of Crombell. Joshua sighed and bemoaned the boy\u2019s idiocy.\u201cViolence? Ah, like persecution.\u201d\u201cHow are you going to take responsibility for the fact that Veron, our close friend and the heir to Villas, is still blind because of your assault?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to hear what you have to say about the claim that you\u2019re a bastard,\u201d Natasha added. \u201cAnd\u2014oh my gosh\u2014is your mother a maid?\u201d She clapped her hand over her mouth.\u201cHis mother is a concubine, and a maid?\u201d\u201cA lowly maid?\u201d\u201cThen\u2014he\u2019s not a child of Agnus?\u201d\u201cIs it true?\u201dJoshua took in Raksha\u2019s stolid gazes and burst out laughing.Now I understand.\u00a0No wonder they were suddenly brave enough to challenge him: they thought he didn\u2019t really have the support of the Duke.\u201cI never believed that the fair and just Duke Agnus would condone such childish, immature behavior!\u201d\u201cWhy would he care about a kid with no roots?\u201d Natasha muttered, but her voice was loud enough that even Joshua\u2019 group could hear.\u201cThis vegetable head\u2014\u201d\u201cIcarus, no!\u201d Agareth grabbed Icarus by the arm before he could punch Natasha.\u201cLet me go, Agareth! I swear I\u2019m gonna sew her mouth shut. Damned broccoli girl.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary\u2014Hey!\u201d Agareth broke into a cold sweat. Icarus\u2019s slender body was exerting an astonishing amount of strength, and it took everything he had to keep the boy back.Were you always so hot-blooded, Icarus?\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing now has nothing to do with my family,\u201d Joshua said.\u201cOr are you just saying that because you don\u2019t want to upset your family now?\u201d Gehog flashed a shifty smile. \u201cAre you afraid of what the Duke will do to you? So sad, it\u2019s too late now\u2014\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Joshua scowled. \u201cI\u2019m being literal. Agnus or not, I will personally punish everyone implicated in this.\u201dJoshua\u2019s mana-infused voice blanketed the area in a frigid, nervous silence.\u201cHa! What a load of shit\u2014\u201d\u00a0Why\u2026 Why am I shivering?\u00a0Gehog unconsciously clenched his trembling legs. Like him, the rest of the children were backing away.\u201cGehog of Crombell, Natasha of Brolly, and Veron of Villas.\u201d Gehog and Natasha shuddered as their names left Joshua\u2019s lips. \u201cI will make sure the three of you are held accountable for your actions.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. Those threats aren\u2019t even funny\u2014\u201d\u201cOn top of everything else, you belong to that filthy Raksha!\u201d Joshua\u2019s booming voice sent more and more children fleeing.Joshua took one step forward, and Raksha took one step back.\u201cI\u2019m going to give you one more chance. Get out of my sight, now. The people here will pay for your sins.\u201d\u201cYou! If you keep acting like this\u2014\u201d Gehog choked. Joshua\u2019s eyes sucked him in like a bottomless abyss, inviting Gehog to his death.\u201cIf I hear\u2026 stuff\u2026\u00a0rumors\u00a0that I\u2019m doing something you don\u2019t like after you\u2019re out of here\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I gotta go!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d\u201cAll I want to do is graduate!\u201dRaksha was fleeing before Joshua finished his sentence. Something in his voice tapped deep into their psyche.\u201cPresident! Are you just going to sit here and watch?\u201d Chwisegi demanded. \u201cPresident?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, you must also accept responsibility for your acts.\u201d The President\u2019s face was stony.\u201cWha-What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m familiar with your relationship with the Twelve Families. We couldn\u2019t take action because there was no substantial evidence.\u201d\u201cWait a minute\u2014What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself?\u201d The President grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re offering their support to fix the mess they created.\u201d\u201cPlease wait, President. It\u2019s the Prime Minister\u2019s seat, but that\u2019s such a silly idea\u2014\u201d\u201cIs the position important?\u201d The other man shook his head. \u201cI believe that whatever position you\u2019re in, being content is good enough.\u201d The President eyed the terrified teacher. \u201cI\u2019m going to request disciplinary action from the Imperial Family, in addition to termination of your employment.\u201d\u201cWho\u2014On what grounds?!\u201dShutein ignored him. \u201cWith that, I, President of the Academy, resign from my position and submit myself to judgment. It was most certainly necessary after all that happened\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 This is not how it was supposed to go\u2026\u201d Chwisegi fell to his knees, bewildered.While the Etiquette teacher was going mad, Gehog had finally come to his senses.\u201cDo you think our family will leave it like this? Surely you don\u2019t think dear old Papa Agnus will come rushing in to save you after this, do you? His successor is still Babel von Agnus! It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re more talented than him\u2014he\u2019s not going to play against our families for you!\u201d\u201cHeirs\u2026 You know, it can change at any time, so I\u2019ll leave it alone for now. I\u2019m not in a rush, after all.\u201dAll three of them jerked around.\u201cDuke\u2014Duke Agnus?\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201dTwo men came into view. One was a middle-aged man with deep blue hair, the other was a thin-eyed man with an atmosphere not unlike Joshua.\u201cWhy\u2026 Even Count Arie bron Sten?\u201d\u201cYou take care of your problems between yourselves, children.\u201d Duke Agnus stared down at the trembling children. \u201cThat\u2019s Academy rules\u2014unless you want to provoke the Agnus family?\u201d The Duke grinned wickedly.Oh my God, he was listening!\u00a0Natasha was dumbstruck.\u201cYou are smart kids,\u201d Duke Agnus looked at Icarus, who withered under his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never do anything that will upset the higher families. That is, if you love\u2014no, at the very least, if you care about your family.\u201d With that, the Duke walked away.Count Sten did not. He looked Gehog and Natasha dead in the eyes and ran his thumb across his neck.The two kids collapsed like broken trees.\u201cJoshua, follow me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Joshua padded after Duke Agnus.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Have you received the Emperor\u2019s orders?\u201d\u201cI thought I would have a quiet life here, but I guess I was wrong.\u201d Joshua grinned. Duke Agnus snorted and chuckled.\u201cYeah, it certainly doesn\u2019t look that way. So you\u2019re going to follow His Majesty\u2019s orders and join the Knights Templar?\u201d\u201cI guess. I\u2019m just a powerless subject of the Empire after all.\u201dDuke Agnus let out a weak, meaningless laugh and leapt to his feet.\u201cHuh?\u201d Count Sten was mortified.\u00a0You can laugh like this too?\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve figured out what this kid is thinking.\u201d\u201cIs this some kind of conversation I\u2019m not rich enough to understand?\u201d Count Sten looked utterly dumbfounded. He wet his lips and flashed a smile at Joshua. \u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn. Do you know who I am?\u201dJoshua nodded. \u201cA proud knight of the Empire; a Master; you are Count Arie bron Sten.\u201d\u201cHuh. Why are you so calm then?\u201d\u201cI knew I\u2019d meet you one day. It was inevitable.\u201dCount Sten giggled hysterically. \u201cI like your attitude.\u201dSuddenly, his expression went blank.\u201cYou did something interesting.\u201d Count Sten licked his lips again. \u201cI wanted you to confirm if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the rapier\u2026\u201d Joshua carefully weighed his words. \u201c...then what you heard is correct.\u201d\u201cOh, so you say my weapon is a piece of garbage that only women use?\u201dJoshua kept his mouth shut. He knew better than to rush into a situation where he didn\u2019t know the other party\u2019s intentions.\u201cMy kid even proved it\u2014the rest of the world ought to believe it as well.\u201d\u201cI want to hear it from his mouth. Do you really believe that rapiers are useless?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t consider rapiers trash. But, I don\u2019t believe that any weapon can compare to the spear.\u201dA very clever answer.Duke Agnus flinched\u2014no doubt Joshua\u2019s opinions included the Duke\u2019s greatsword as well. Count Sten looked disappointed, but his boisterous sense of humor had him laughing in short order.\u201cHa! Hahahahahaha!\u201d The Count laughed until his eyes teared up. \u201cIt seems I\u2019ve been too proud of myself. I honestly thought it was because you were looking up to your father. Indeed, arrogant and conceited.\u201dCount Sten\u2019s eyes narrowed and bored down on Joshua. Their one-of-a-kind intensity crackled on every nerve of Joshua\u2019s body.Murderous aura!\u00a0Joshua pupils dilated; he knew this feeling well. Only a Master could exude this kind of energy. Any ordinary person, and some knights, would falter under this ominous stare, but Joshua only clenched his fists and quietly began to circulate his mana.Murderous aura was an expression of will\u2014the will to kill your opponent, in its ultimate form. The sensation can\u2019t be explained, only felt.The crucial point was that skill had no bearing on your murderous aura.The greatest assassins are those born with the finest killer instincts. They don\u2019t regard lives as anything special, and will end them without a second thought. Murderous aura is an ideal tool for them\u2014it can delay their target\u2019s actions for a moment, giving them the perfect opening for their dagger to strike. Controlling your murderous aura is the hallmark of a successful assassin.Is it something you have to be born with, then?No.No one is naturally murderous, at least to begin with. Once, twice, three times\u2014after a few times, killing becomes natural. But to master the basics of murderous aura, one must spill the blood of a thousand people.Joshua considered one person to be the true master of his murderous aura; an old friend, and a key contributor in a new philosophy of martial arts.The Assassination King, Pacheucheut.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes flickered with sparks.Strictly speaking, the energy Count Sten and the other knights emitted was not truly a murderous aura. It was just a kind of momentum, a crystal-pure energy that has not been processed by the body\u2019s ability.Joshua\u2019s fathomless blue eyes sparkled with a strange light.This energy\u2014\u00a0Count Sten\u2019s eyebrows twitched. He\u2019d been observing the boy quite closely; he found the boy\u2019s cool demeanor in front of a Master to be rather refreshing. The Count was curious to see what the boy would do.It was the right thing to do. The boy kept his calm through it all and even went beyond standing his ground\u2014the boy\u2019s energy pressed against the Count\u2019s and matched it.Count Sten began building up more and more momentum\u2014but then, he stiffened. Ominous alarms rang inside his head; he took an unconscious step back, and stared at Joshua.I saw it in his eyes, clearly.\u00a0That murderous aura, hanging in the air was like an invisible dagger stabbing at his heart. It wasn\u2019t like wizard\u2019s illusion magic; Count Sten wouldn\u2019t fall for such parlor tricks.\u201cHahaha.\u201d Count Sten let out a low laugh. The boy had taken a step back, like he had, and the clashing energies faded away like they\u2019d never been there at all. \u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201dDid I hurt your self-esteem?\u00a0Joshua thought to himself.\u00a0You\u2019re welcome!It was the opposite, in fact.That was a lot of fun. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how far this little guy can go.\u00a0The boy had yet to produce the fruit of success, but it was ripe and ready to fall. How sweet would it be?\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d A shiver ran up his body and he wrapped his arms around himself. \u201cHeok!\u201d Count Sten\u2019s nails dug into his skin.I want to run my rapier across his little neck.\u00a0How would it taste? What kind of face would he make?\u00a0When your life flashes before your eyes, will you beg?\u201cPatience\u2026 I have to be patient. Later\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Duke Agnus positioned himself between them while Count Sten was desperately trying to control his bloodlust.Oh yeah. He was here.\u00a0Just like that, Count Sten was serene again.He licked his lips again. The finest dishes should be saved until the end\u2014Not many delicacies could excite Count Sten\u2019s taste buds as much as this one.\u201cJoshua.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke?\u201d\u201cIf it is your will, I will allow you to leave the Academy. And\u2026 If you decide to join the Imperial Knights, get into the 3rd Battalion at the very least.\u201dJoshua\u2019s eyes widened. It was obvious to him what Duke Agnus meant.\u201cAll right.\u201dDuke Agnus turned and walked away.\u201c...if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Duchess allowed only one person unrestricted access, and that was Duke Agnus. Yet, someone else was present.\u201cYou don\u2019t think you look bad?\u201d Chiffon grimaced at the Duchess, whose normal beauty had withered down to the bone.\u201cI gave everything for Babel in the Imperial Court\u2014not somewhere else! I\u2019m so mad.\u201d\u201cYou look terrible.\u201d\u201cFor him to say that, and for the Imperial Family to summon Babel so abruptly! I can\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep, because of that upstart brat!\u201dChiffon watched the Duchess fret for a minute.\u201cI\u2019m going to Arcadia.\u201d He knelt before Vanessa where she sat on the bed.\u201cWhat?\u201d The Duchess went still. \u201cYou\u2019re going to act without his consent?\u201d\u201cIf this continues, as the Duchess is worried about, our long-term plans will fail, and I will struggle to survive Duke Agnus\u2019s clutches.\u201d He smiled softly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it better to be beaten half to death rather than wait for the ax to fall?\u201d\u201cThe Imperial Palace is a dangerous place,\u201d Vanessa mumbled, eyeing Chiffon strangely. \u201cEven your head may end up rolling at any moment.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that I used to be a member of the Knights Templar?\u201d Chiffon lifted Duchess Vanessa\u2019s hand and kissed it. \u201cDon\u2019t be concerned about me. Even if death comes, I would gladly meet it for you.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 Please return safely.\u201dChiffon lifted his head and beamed.\u201cI will.\u201dJoshua flopped around on the bed in his manor on the outskirts of Arcadia.\u201cI always thought Count Sten was a lunatic.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019ll never forget the sensation of the snake eyes darting over my body.But Joshua shook it off quickly.\u201cMore importantly\u2026\u201d He clutched his chin, pondering Duke Agnus\u2019s words.The Third Battalion, at least?The more talented you were, the higher your rank in the Imperial Knights, and the bigger the benefits. The upper battalions\u2014the 1st through 3rd\u2014received particular special attention from the Emperor himself.Titles.\u00a0Ordinary knights were treated like barons, although they were not, strictly speaking, true nobles. The Emperor bestowed noble titles on those who make significant contributions to the country\u2014which, particularly in Avalon, was as simple as plucking a star out of the sky. Even more so in times of peace.Is he advising me to abandon the family? Or\u2026?\u00a0When the son of a prestigious family seeks a new title, rather than inheriting the family name, it has only one connotation: he was abandoning the battle for succession, and is founding a house of his own.Joshua closed his eyes thoughtfully.Although even if he did get his own title inheriting the duchy wasn\u2019t impossible.\u00a0All I have to do is give up the new title and then take up the Agnus name.\u201cHow long are you going to do that?\u201d he said to the empty ceiling. \u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve visited unexpectedly?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong after all.\u201d A dark figure fell from the ceiling. It was Jero, the manager of Moon Gate\u2019s Arcadia branch. \u201cEven knights with a decent sixth sense would struggle to detect my presence unless they understood stealth\u2026 The more I learn about you, Young Master, the more it seems I have to learn.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try\u2014you might get hurt.\u201dJero gave him a blank look and then burst out laughing.\u201cI\u2019d like to do that,\u201d he gasped, \u201cbut it's my job.\u201d\u201cSo, does your job involve sneaking in here?\u201d\u201cReally now\u2026\u201d Jero shrugged morosely. \u201cI am here for work, but not to scavenge for data.\u201d\u201cThat means\u2014\u201d\u201cAn issue has come up with your information request.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt appears that I will have to leave Arcadia for the time being. Some hiccups in the supply of your requested information will be inevitable because I am the only person in Arcadia who can handle the information you\u2019re interested in\u2014\u201d\u201cI suppose you\u2019re headed to the Principality of Thran?\u201d Joshua laughed.Jero flinched. \u201cReally,\u201d he said, tilting his head, \u201cto infer that much from just a few sentences\u2014\u201d\u201cWar is prime business for intelligence organizations like you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t refute that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed. Moon Gate is throwing away its existing customers\u2019 trust for profit.\u201d Joshua shrugged.\u201cWhat an awful thing to say.\u201d Jero looked truly saddened. \u201cFrom our perspective, we\u2019re making a huge gamble on the Young Master\u2019s potential\u2014but the conflict between Swallow and Thran will go on for a long time, and the value of information is soaring on both sides of the war.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t our deal already settled?\u201d Joshua looked shocked. \u201cBut now that the cost of information is skyrocketing, you come waltzing over here to compare it with my commission? Has the Moon Gate become a bunch of gangsters?\u201d\u201cHahhh, really\u2026 I\u2019m not falling for it. The Young Master is the bully here, not us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d\u201cIs there anything else you want?\u201d\u201cFor the time being, I believe I owe the Moon Gate. However\u2026\u201d Joshua smiled cruelly at Jero, who looked apprehensive. \u201cI\u2019d like you to extend the deadline for the red coin a little longer. I know I said it would take at least three years, but I\u2019m moving.\u201dThe mention of the red coin made Jero\u2019s expression harden.\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re going to leave the Academy, even though you just got here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like I said. The Emperor ordered me to join the Imperial Knights.\u201dJero was unable to hide his surprise and his eyes widened.\u201c...It seems we\u2019ll need to work hard.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even surprised.\u201d Joshua chuckled. \u201cI was expecting you to ask me what happened.\u201d\u201cWell, I already said\u2014\u201d Jero gave up on making an excuse and sighed.\u00a0I always thought so, but this boy always drags me along when I talk to him. Maybe he\u2019s actually a dragon playing around with polymorph magic\u2026\u00a0He shook his head and chuckled. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s fine. You will be given a complete timeline for the red coin assignment. We don\u2019t have time to worry about it at the moment\u2014the entire organization is busy.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d The boy gave Jero a satisfied grin. \u201cNow are you going to tell me about the changes to my information request?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your expression when I tell you this.\u201d Jero\u2019s concern had faded, replaced with mirth. \u201cGive me the look of an innocent lamb, please.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it as well. What in the world do you have stewing?\u201d\u201cDraxia bel Grace, the War God. He\u2019s been in contact with the Imperial Family, in some fashion.\u201dJero watched Joshua\u2019s face carefully.\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised at all.\u201d\u201cI already knew.\u201d\u201cReally? You knew he was connected to the Emperor?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Joshua\u2019s eyes narrowed. He remembered that Draxia had ties with Kaiser, not the Emperor.\u201c...No way.\u201d The situation between the Swallow Empire and the Principality of Thran, the ties the Imperial Family of Swallow had\u2026\u00a0Is that right?\u00a0Joshua was only guessing, but it was a good guess.\u201cLet me ask you something.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Jero looked up.\u201cDo you really trust the information from the Moon Gate?\u201d\u201cTo be honest\u2026 I do believe the data is reliable.\u201d\u201cAnd it has nothing to do with his father\u2019s link to the Imperial Family of Swallow?\u201d\u201cSo you knew that too.\u201d Jero\u2019s eyes glowed. \u201cJust like your father\u2026 We won\u2019t be able to discuss this fully without Demero\u2014Demero bel Grace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite all these rumors around him, he was really young. Apart from the renowned name of \u2018War God\u2019, he also shared another, more noble title. He was the nephew of Verona Belle Grace, the Emperor of the Swallow Kingdom.\u201cDraxia Belle Grace\u201d the thin-eyed man said quietly while stretching out his right arm.In conjunction with that small motion, sharp-edged rapiers were pulled out and an appearance rushed forward. A streak of fresh blood splattered on the right cheek of the thin-eyed man.\u201cKeugh.\u201dThe man in front of him collapsed with the sound of squirting blood. The eagle insignia of the Swallow Empire was visibly engraved on the deceased man's breast.\u201cKekeke.\u201dA little giggle erupted from the narrow-eyed man who licked his red tongue over the blood spattered on his cheek.\u201cArie, it's ok if you have a little fun, but remember that we don't have a lot of time.\u201dThe old man, who was wearing a monocle and had his white hair carefully brushed back, swung his arms over his body. As his swing came down, a sword's hilt glinted in the moonlight and as he pulled it out, a bloodied saber could be seen.\u201cUgh.\u201dAnother man who appeared to be a Swallow Empire soldier fell to the ground with a weak cry.\u201cPlease\u2026 save\u2026 save\u2014\u201dShing.\u201cHooh.\u201dThe old man shook the saber when he saw that it was already covered in blood. As he did that, the blood that had accumulated on the sword's blade, splashed all over the floor. He looked disgustedly at his last victim as he spit on his body.Tak. Tak. Tak.\u201c...\u201dCount Arie Bron Sten who whistled softly, turned around and faced the old man.He made a thumbs up gesture as he smiled slyly.\u201cThat was very clever, Duke Tremblin. Every time I see you in action, you never cease to amaze me. Are you really an old man?\u201dGeshart Kon Tremblin.He was one of the five great Dukes. An absolute being who had reached the level of a Master over 20 years ago.Even within the vast Avalon Empire, Duke Geshart Kon Tremblin, who was standing in front of Count Sten, would probably be one of the top three talented men.With a frown on his face, Geshart said, \u201cThey said that this is a border zone, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is still the enemy\u2019s territory. Aren\u2019t we too laid back with our attacks?\u201d\u201cOh my, Duke...what are you so worried about? I don\u2019t know if going straight to an enemy camp and taking the head of Emperor Verona would be considered funny.\u201d\u201cA Knight always needs to do his best.\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dWith a disgruntled grimace on his face, Arie stepped forward.\u2018This old man doesn\u2019t know how to have fun even though he\u2019s very skilled. Unlike Duke Agnus who was much much more intriguing\u2014\u2019Especially that child, the one with the strong desire.Arie trembled as he recalled the memories he had with Joshua.\u2018I have to wait a little longer until that fruit is ripe.\u2019\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dSeeing Arie licking his upper lips, Geshart asked.\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhy did you mention his name? Draxia Belle Grace? Have you forgotten that the emperor has given you a warning about practicing caution with both your words and your actions?\u201dAfter hearing Geshart\u2019s scolding, Arie ruffled his bangs.'The old man has a pair of brilliant ears too\u2014'Arie, who had been muttering to himself, straightened his face and opened his mouth and said.\u201cI was merely expressing my dissatisfaction with the situation.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so displeased about?\u201dArie resumed his speech as he watched Geshart coming to a halt and questioning him.\u201cI don\u2019t like how Draxia Belle Grace is forcing us around. I think it shows that our great Empire is being forced to join hands with that kid who can only see blood.\u201d\u201cIt is His Majesty\u2019s will.\u201dGeshart took a deep breath and bent over and opened his mouth, ready to say something.He got up after rummaging through the dirt and finding a piece of fabric. As he examined the pattern in the fabric, Arie made a remark.\u201cI don't believe they'll be fooled by such inane jokes.\u201d\u201cIt makes no difference whether they\u2019re tricked or not.\u201d\u201c...?\u201dGeshart continued talking after noticing Arie's face because it showed that the man needed a bit of explanation to understand what he had just said.\u201cPeople have a proclivity to believe what they want to believe. If the guards in the border area near Thran were killed in the present anti-war crisis\u2014\u201d\u201cThen the eyes of the people will be in that direction?\u201dArie, who had started chuckling as if he were amused, came to a halt as he realized something.\u201cDraxia Belle Grace. What that kid wants is the throne, right?\u201d\u201c...\u201dGeshart rose up and took a quick look around before responding,\u201cThat\u2014\u201d\u201cSince the Emperor of the Swallow Kingdom has no sons who can inherit the throne, then the kid is probably aiming for it. This would explain everything.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cDoes he want the position so much that he would gladly join hands with an enemy country?\u201d\u201cStop trying to find out everything. His Majesty will make all the important decisions.\u201dAs if he didn't care, Arie spread his palms out,\u201cI\u2019m curious about why you are moving so slowly. I mean, it\u2019s not like I hate this place you know, with the blood and everything\u2026but as you said, we don\u2019t have much time left.\u201dArie began to walk gently after speaking.\u201c...\u201dGeshart let out a deep sigh as he stared at Arie's back.He was walking through a bloody path as he returned the same way that he had come from.Hundreds, if not thousands of bodies were laying on the ground and the grass all around them was stained with red blood as he walked all over the bodies.All of the bodies had holes in fatal areas including the forehead, heart, and nape of the neck, and all of the bodies were dripping blood.'He's the type of person who has no idea when or where he'll be, so I can only sympathize with Evergrant's warning to be extra cautious now.'With a shake of his head, Geshart started following Arie.\u201cI'll accompany you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWith a ridiculous expression on his face, Joshua inquired as he looked at the boy barring him from proceeding with his arms wide extended in front of him.After sending the formal letter of withdrawal to the Academy President's Office, Joshua was on his way back.There was someone in his way, waiting for a last goodbye...\u201cIcarus\u2014\u201dJoshua quietly began examining the boy in front of him.Light blue hair with a rich sheen that shone brilliantly and resembled the sky.His double eyelids drooped, his larger-than-average eyes were full of color, and his diminutive face, on the other hand, was in perfect equilibrium with his features.Icarus had no idea, but Joshua knew that Icarus\u2019s stunning appearance would be at the top of the list when it came to the list of most desirable spouses of the noble families in the area.\u2018Perhaps if he wasn\u2019t a boy, then he would be\u2014\u2019\u201cBeautiful, absolutely lovely.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIcarus jumped in astonishment as Joshua accidently spewed out his feelings.Icarus blushed as if he understood what Joshua meant and Joshua broke out laughing.\u201cCome with me? What do you mean?\u201dIcarus raised his head in response to Joshua's question.\u201cI meant what I said. You said that you\u2019ll be going to the Imperial palace, didn\u2019t you? So please bring me along with you.\u201d\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying right now?\u201d\u201cYes! Please take me in as your servant. I want to come along as Young Master Joshua\u2019s servant.\u201d\u201c...\u201dJoshua closed his jaws and stared Icarus in the eyes.Icarus glanced at Joshua without looking away, despite the fact that his face was burning hot.\u2018Is he serious?\u2019As he grumbled inside, Joshua's eyes dropped down,An attendant.It literally referred to someone who rides with a knight. Someone who was like the eyes and the ears of the knight.One needed to be a knight, but he also needed a servant who would run errands for him outside the palace or wherever the Knight was dispatched.'No one can deny that he is descended from peasants, but now that he is indisputably a nobleman, so why is he referring to himself as a servant?\u2019At Icarus\u2019s words which he couldn\u2019t properly understand, Joshua just stood there completely immersed in his thoughts trying to figure out Icarus\u2019s request. At that moment, Icarus opened his mouth and explained.\u201cBut what I want is a permanent type of contract. One that clearly entails within it the starting to the ending terms.\u201d\u201cA fixed contract?\u201dIcarus nodded when Joshua asked the question with a perplexed expression.\u201cThe term will only be until you\u2019re with the Knights corps at the Imperial Palace. If you leave the Imperial Palace, then the contract will also end.\u201dJoshua burst out laughing almost immediately, as if he knew what Icarus was saying.\u201cIt's as if you think I'm going to join the Imperial Knights, which has never happened before in any generation.\u201d\u201cI know because I trust what I saw.\u201d\u201c...\u201dIcarus' confident statements caused Joshua to sigh slightly,\u201cIf you don\u2019t really want to be my servant, what is the true purpose?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201dIcarus spoke with a determined expression on his face after a little pause.\u201cBy being with the Young master, I know that I can prove my worth.\u201d\u201cYou want to prove your worth.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIcarus continued with an explanation after offering a brief response,\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you wanted me to be one of your people?\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to earn that place just because I\u2019m your friend. If possible, what I really want to do is to amaze you with just my abilities!\u201dIcarus straightened his brows and gazed at Joshua.\u201cWhen the contract comes to its end, I hope that the Young Master can give me the place that I think I deserve.\u201d\u201c...\u201dJoshua took a breath and turned to face Icarus.\u201cLet me ask you one question.\u201d\u201cAnything.\u201d\u201cAre you just betting on me, because of my family?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWith a resolute expression on his face, Icarus shook his head.\u201cDespite the fact that your name is Joshua von Agnus, I believe that one day, you will grow to exceed that name of yours. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing every time I look at you.\u201d\u201c...\u201dJoshua finally grinned at Icarus's answer.Joshua was now convinced that like Cain, Icarus in front of him was now one of his people.You want to demonstrate your worth?There was no need for such a time-consuming procedure.Because Joshua was already aware of Icarus's power.'He has a lot of charisma. In my opinion, nothing is more certain than having Icarus on our side.'As he gazed at Icarus' lovely face, a warm spark flashed in Joshua's eyes.'However\u2014'Then Joshua, with a determined expression on his face, opened his mouth.\u201cYour suggestion\u2014\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

About 1000 of the guards who were manning it are dead!\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe nobility of Court's eyes widened in surprise in an instant.\u201cWhat nonsense is that?\u201dThe enraged Duke Momori screamed.\u201cPlease explain it in full detail.\u201dPrime Minister Marco replied, his palms casually outstretched as though attempting to soothe the duke.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Lord Baker is looking into it for now, but the only thing that was clear from the scene was this\u2014\u201dThe messenger produced a muddy rag that he had kept concealed in his arms.\u201cThis\u2026 This is the only evidence that was found.\u201d\u201cBring it here.\u201dThe messenger swiftly approached Prime Minister Marco and politely put out a piece of cloth in response to his words.\u201cThe Baker estate is located between Thran and Swallow\u2026 His majesty\u2019s burdens are piling up each day\u2014\u201dDuke Momori commented, punching his own chest as if he was fighting his urge to explode in anger.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen Prime Minister Marco saw the pattern engraved on the piece of cloth, he let out a quiet groan.\u201cPrime Minister! Do you have any information regarding the suspects' identities?\u201d\u201cThis design\u2014\u201dWhen the Duke asked the question, Prime Minister Marco sighed and held out the piece of fabric.It resembled the Swallow Empire's pattern, but it wasn\u2019t the same.The pattern showed a small bird soaring in the sky.\u201cWhat does the pattern mean?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this pattern clearly Thran\u2019s?\u201d\u201cThose motherfuckers\u2014\u201dThe prime Minister took a step forward when the nobility of the court descended into chaos, where some were bursting with anger, whereas some were readying to flee.\u201cStop! It\u2019s too early to conclude who was responsible!\u201dIn response to Prime Minister Marco\u2019s restraint, Duke Momori raised his trembling voice.\u201cWhat are you saying, Prime Minister? Do we still need more evidence? If this doesn\u2019t scream Thran\u2019s preposterousness, I don\u2019t know what will! What other country will attack ours if not them?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cOne victory is all they need to completely be hostile against us! Am I the only one who sees this? It's clear evidence! Their declaration for an all-out war is this, a piece of cloth!\u201d\u201cNo, that isn't it. Don\u2019t any of you think that there is something odd about this?\u201dAs Prime Minister Marco's quiet but powerful speech reverberated throughout the court, the murmur began to dissipate.\u201cIf a large army moved to slay a thousand of our men, then Lord Baker would\u2019ve noticed it because the place is situated in a vast plain land. This meant that what we are dealing with here was only a small number of people.\u201dPrime Minister Marco finished his speech with his eyes gleaming, having correctly summarized the circumstance in only a few sentences.\u201cThis is strange indeed. Since such a situation would mean that there were only a small number of people. They\u2019re definitely talented, but they left such evidence.\u201dAfter speaking, Prime Minister Marco waved the piece of cloth in his hand.\u201cNo! That\u2019s only the Prime Minister\u2019s guess! The post war situation made it clear what\u2019s on Thran\u2019s mind!\u201dDuke Momori, who had been chasing after the Principality of Thran, continued to raise his voice.\u201cThis time, we have to get rid of them completely! I'll get permission and go out on my own as soon as His Majesty enters the palace!\u201d\u201cLet me ask Duke Momori something!\u201dPrime Minister Marco, too, raised his voice, as if he didn't want to lose.\u201cCan the Duke slay a thousand elite guards with only ten of your knights with you? Moreover, in just half a day?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDuke Momori exclaimed enthusiastically without hesitation.\u201cEven if the adversaries are on par with our Empire's elite warriors, who have the continent's strongest battle capability, if it were me and my knights, I am confident that I could kill that many soldiers!\u201d\u201cWhat rubbish\u2014\u201dThe aristocrats in the Court began to grumble again when Prime Minister Marco\u2019s words fell short on the ears of the Duke.\u201cThis time, let\u2019s show those bastards who we really are! Since when did the Swallow Kingdom think about any other Kingdom in the first place?\u201d\u201cDuke Momori is correct! The more we keep our silence, the more our neighbors will think less of us!\u201d\u201cWe must make use of this opportunity to spread the empire's splendor throughout the entire continent!\u201dDuke Momori nodded his head, satisfied at the responses of the nobles..\u201cDon\u2019t try to stop me, Prime Minister Marco! I will go by myself now.\u201d\u201cHow can you just make such a hasty decision\u2014\u201dPrime Minister Marco's face soon changed into a contemplative expression as he was about to say something.It was because he understood that, no matter what he said in this environment, not even the slightest of it would be heard by anyone.'The only option is to wait for His Majesty to rush into the palace\u2014'His Majesty the Emperor, who went to the flower garden with the princess, would have heard the news by now.It was a special time the two of them shared after such a long time apart, yet it was now going to be cut short because the situation had become what it was.\u201cHaah.\u201dPrime Minister Marco's long sigh echoed silently in the atmosphere where the aristocrats raised their voices.A lovely flower garden with a wide variety of flowers.Behind the army of Knights, a man and a woman were talking.Emperor Verona, who made people feel at ease just by glancing at him, smiled as he opened his mouth.\u201cYerona.\u201d\u201cAh! Yes Father?\u201dThe blonde beauty who was strolling alongside him, turned and answered his call.\u2018Hasn\u2019t she just turned twenty?\u2019A blonde woman with melancholy and huge eyes.She was in a pristine white gown, and her aura was eerily similar to Emperor Verona's.Her name was Yerona Belle Grace.Emperor Verona had three daughters. All of them were extremely brilliant and smart, but he treasured his youngest daughter the most.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about a lot of things lately\u2014\u201dPrincess Yerona straightened her stance in response to Emperor Verona's anxious voice.\u201cIs there something bothering you, father?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2014\u201dEmperor Verona sighed and resumed his speech, which had been disrupted by an introspective memory near the end of it.\u201cI have a hunch that if I had given Demero the throne, more and more of the Empire's people would have been happy.\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying this all of a sudden?\u201dPrincess Yerona, whose eyes widened for a brief period at Emperor Verona's surprising comments, stated as she remembered something,\u201cIs it due to the Thran Principality\u2019s affairs?\u201d\u201cThey are our people too. I usually think of them as a subordinate country, but I hate it when the situation is twisted like this\u2026 I don\u2019t want to call them our enemy. I find this situation very unpleasant.\u201d\u201c...\u201dPrincess Jerona remained silent in response to Emperor Verona's statements.It was because she sensed a tremendous longing in the Emperor's heart for all of his subjects.\u201cDo you have a number of policies in place for the Principality of Thran? They too must have a better comprehension of your heart than anybody else.\u201d\u201cLook at this.\u201dEmperor Verona reached into his bosom and handed Princess Yerona a parchment.\u201cThis\u2014\u201dAfter reading the contents of the parchment, Princess Yerona\u2019s eyes gradually began to enlarge.\u201d\u201c\u2026guards were wiped out\u2014\u201d\u201cI'll have to look into the details, but this wouldn't have happened if I had handled it properly in the first place.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dPrincess Yerona whispered, her voice seemingly melancholy.He was a father who had adored his children beyond all else, and after them, came his people.That was why he was blaming himself and condemning himself for the current predicament the Empire was in.Princess Yerona, whose face had hardened, opened her mouth.\u201cWith my shallow eyesight, I can't foresee everything, but\u2026 At the very least, we're aware of one thing.\u201d\u201c...\u201dPrincess Yerona resumed her speech while her father turned to look at her with a perplexed face.\u201cThe people of the Empire would have suffered far more than they do today if Uncle Demero had risen to the throne. On the first day I left for the palace with father, I will never forget the smiles on the faces of the Empire's people, and the way they honestly honored father.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cFather\u2026 You've done a good job thus far, as the sun of the empire, and my father, of whom I am the proudest of. I am sure that you'll do much better in the future. As a result\u2014\u201dPrincess Yerona paused her speech and snatched both of Emperor Verona's hands.\u201cDon't hold it against yourself. Of course, I don't want my father to be like this, and neither do the people of the Empire.\u201d\u201cThank you so much.\u201dEmperor Verona instantly smiled sweetly.For a brief period, Emperor Verona raised his head toward the heavens, smiling at Princess Yerona\u2019s words.\u201cI can't help but think of Demero at moments like this... he was the most dependable person\u2014\u201dPrincess Yerona's visage had become a frosty scowl.\u201cFor more than ten years, he hasn't shown himself. He probably doesn't care about the Empire because his life or death is unclear.\u201d\u201c...\u201dEmperor Verona remained silent as he saw the fluttering birds in the sky.\u2018I was reminded of the previously amicable Empire and the Principality of Thran when I watched those birds playing together.\u2019\u201cPlease, don't let any more blood pour into this land\u2014\u201dEmperor Verona, who had been mumbling a little, moved hurriedly and stiffly to somewhere.\u201cI have to refuse.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dIcarus was taken aback by Joshua's quick response.\u201cI\u2019m not a worthless servant so I won\u2019t be a nuisance to the Young Master.\u201d\u201c...\u201dIcarus spoke urgently but Joshua kept his mouth shut.\u201cAll I want is to prove myself to the Young Master! I will never wish for anything! You don\u2019t need to compensate me or anything! Please reconsider\u2014\u201d\u201cOn the contrary\u2014\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIcarus was taken aback when he noticed Joshua interrupting his speech in the middle and shouting loudly.\u201cI'm saying this because I believe your worth is excessively more than for my benefit alone.\"\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you really want to show me how valuable you are\u2014\u201dJoshua said firmly, looking into Icarus's lovely eyes,\u201cAfter I leave, change this place yourself.\u201d\u201c...!\u201dIcarus' eyes widened as he heard Joshua's following remarks.Joshua continued speaking and a warm smile spread across his face as he looked at Icarus.\u201cWell, if it is necessary, you can always use the name of my family. Besides, staying here where so much knowledge has been accumulated is more beneficial to you rather than following me and being my servant.\u201d\u201cJoshua\u2014\u201dIcarus quickly comprehended what Joshua was trying to tell him and muttered something incomprehensible.It was difficult to believe that the proud Agnus family's child in front of him was so caring towards Icarus.When Icarus saw Joshua get closer and approach him suddenly, he was surprised and gasped a little.\u201cI\u2014\u201dJoshua finished his last words, directing a deep, deep gaze on Icarus, whose face was now blushing red.\u201cI don\u2019t want my person to be a servant.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Few people could receive such respect from Evergrant, but Ian teon Murray, lord of the Magic Tower and the only Seventh-Class magician on the continent, was one of them. Even for the highest wizard in the Avalon Empire, it was only natural to bend to Ian.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cNothing much.\u201d Ian smiled weakly at Evergrant, sadness evident in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just short on workers after you left abruptly.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do but apologize.\u201d Evergrant bent his head remorsefully.\u201cNo\u2014That\u2019s not the reason I called. The older I get, the grumpier I am about my subordinates.\u201d Ian looked over Evergrant carefully. \u201cIs the Emperor treating you well?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s given me everything I need.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThere was a moment of silence before Ian opened his mouth with a stiff expression.\u201cI know why you accepted the Emperor\u2019s offer\u2014I am aware of your ambitions. While he may be ruling like a dictator, you had few good options. But, you see, I also know that you are supporting the Fourth Prince.\u201d\u201cMy Lord\u2014\u201d\u201cYour choice seems completely random; I don\u2019t believe the Fourth Prince has any chance of inheriting the throne. Rather, it would be best to curry favor with the First or Second Prince.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t argue.\u201d Evergrant quickly gave up on finding a counterargument. The Tower Master wasn\u2019t wrong: based on all available information, the First and Second Princes were the ones with the best chances of taking the throne. However, what Evergrant had felt the first time he saw the Fourth Prince was not so easy to deny.\u201cJack is dead.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Evergrant boggled at Ian. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d\u201cThat means that someone killed Jack Steropes, a member of the Sevens and the seat of the Thunderbolt.\u201d\u201cWha\u2014That doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d\u201cSo I reached out to you. I need a favor.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice became deep and somber. \u201cEvergrant von Aswald, I would like to offer the empty seat to you. I want you to be a member of the Seven Magicians.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2014!\u201d\u201cI believe this position will be of great help to you in realizing your goals\u2014more than the uncertain path you\u2019re taking now.\u201d\u201cWhy do you have to put it that way\u2026\u201d Evergrant shook his head, biting his lips anxiously. \u201cI can\u2019t accept.\u201d\u201cI expected that.\u201d Ian laughed heartily. \u201cMaybe you saw some potential in the Fourth Prince, I don\u2019t know. But I do know that you don\u2019t make hasty decisions. I trust you and your aims for the Imperial Family of Avalon. Plus, the monument made of Jade stones in the Imperial Knights\u2014\u201d\u201cYou knew about that?\u201d Evergrant blurted.Ian nodded. \u201cA wizard always seeks the truth, and I always pursue my curiosity.\u201dThe Tower Master took another look at Evergrant.\u201cMy offer stands. I\u2019ll do my best to fix up your place if you decide to come back.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Evergrant was touched.\u201cIt\u2019s shameless of me to ask you for a favor like this; I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, Master!\u201d\u201cI know the last place Jack stayed. It was easier to find than I expected\u2014he used a warp gate.\u201dEvergrant nodded and quietly recalled what he knew of the warp gates.\u201cWhere\u2014\u201d\u201cThe capital of Avalon, Arcadia. Where you are.\u201dEvergrant leapt out of his seat.In this quiet place, out of Joshua\u2019s knowledge, history was being rewritten.\u201cI\u2019m his man?\u201d Icarus was mumbling to himself after Joshua left.Joshua, his role model, had departed, leaving Icarus to prove his worth.The boy\u2019s face went beet red. Whenever he thought of Joshua and that day, his face burned.\u201cI\u2019ll prove my worth. One day he\u2019ll be asking me for favors\u2014\u201d\u201cAre you alone?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Agareth?\u201d Icarus turned towards the voice. \u201cWh-wh-why do you look like that?!\u201d\u201cAh, I just finished something and was about to take a shower, so I took my clothes off\u2014\u201d The underwear-clad boy paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your face? Are you sick?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m not sick, I just feel a little hot\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Agareth nodded. \u201cGreat, should we shower together?\u201d\u201cNo thank you!\u201d Icarus\u2019s face flushed impossibly red. Icarus slammed the door shut, carefully avoiding meeting Agareth\u2019s eyes.\u201c...What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you in person.\u201d Joshua gazed up at the towering walls of the Imperial Palace with regretful eyes.This place gave him the most vivid memories of his life. It was where he lived; a house, but never a home. He knew this place better than his own home, the Duchy, because he spent so much time by Kaiser\u2019s side.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Joshua smiled bitterly. \u201cThe battlefield was home for me.\u201dHe\u2019d spent most of his life on the battlefield. Rotting bodies and the smell of blood was more familiar to Joshua than anything else.\u201cHalt! This is the Imperial Palace of Avalon. Unauthorized visitors are not permitted.\u201d A guard blocked the outer gate as Joshua approached. \u201cPlease, if you could show me a card or pass to prove your identity.\u201dDespite Joshua\u2019s appearance, the guard remained cautious and courteous. Even though the Imperial Palace was obviously not a place for children to be visiting alone, there were very few people who came at all; the guard was very professional.\u201cI\u2019m here to apply for Berche\u2019s bloody battle.\u201d\u201cWait, what?\u201d The guard laughed. \u201cDo you have any idea what that means, kid?\u201d He\u2019d been looking down on the boy to begin with, but this was too much.\u201cRiver!\u201d The other guard grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s a visitor to the Imperial Palace\u2014what kind of attitude is that?\u201d\u201cBunto\u2026 That kind of attitude annoys me the most. Was there ever a time when a kid this small entered Berche\u2019s?\u201d\u201cThe\u2026\u201d\u201cSee?\u201d River laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done something like this before.\u201d He turned and hissed at Joshua. \u201cLittle guy, they\u2019re busier than you think. I\u2019ll forgive you this time, so scoot. Come back when you\u2019ve got some more height and weight to that body.\u201d River flicked his finger dismissively at Joshua.Of course, who would believe that a child would have a real reason to visit the Palace on his own? Joshua was struggling to even begin to find a way to explain himself.\u201cThis kid even has the balls to bring up Berche\u2014\u201d\u201cStop scolding the kid.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Joshua smiled and stepped forward.\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cI, Joshua von Agnus, have come here per His Majesty\u2019s instructions.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense is this\u2014\u201dJoshua pumped mana into his ring.

The pattern of the Agnus Duchy!?\u201dRiver\u2019s eyes widened as he saw the Knight\u2019s emblem which was encased in the pristine white armor the boy in front of him was now wearing.He was unable to rationalize his thoughts and he couldn\u2019t come to his senses.\u2018How did the kid have the Agnus\u2019 pattern on his chest?\u2019\u201cPlease forgive my rudeness, Young Master!\u201dThe other quick-witted Knight, Bunto, immediately bowed his head right away.\u201c...!\u201dWhen River saw what had transpired, he immediately followed his subordinate and bowed his head.\u201cThe bearer of the mark of the Agnus duchy, welcome to the Imperial Palace!\u201dRiver scolded himself for his previous statements, which he now realized were utterly out of context..\u201cWhat the heck\u2014\u201dThe boy in front of them began to move as River spat out curses.The sound of the boy\u2019s movements along with a faint metal sound was the only thing they could hear in the dead silence that surrounded them.\u2018What the hell is this\u2014\u2019It was the mark of the Agnus duchy.And as far as he knew, the artifact that Joshua had used just now was a Deon ring.Even if the armor appeared to be slightly strange,River was convinced that the young boy in front of him was probably going to be the next master, or even the successor of Duke Agnus.River's expression gradually began to turn into tears.He had been married for 10 years, and he was now 30 years old.\u2018Why do I find myself desperately thinking of my rabbit-like children and my bear-like wife, whom I love so much at such a time?\u2019\u201cOh God\u2014\u201dRiver sincerely prayed to the God that he typically didn\u2019t believe in.But as if it were a lie, God responded to River\u2019s wishes.Clank.The sound of metal crashing to the floor was constantly heard as the young boy walked away. A sound which still brought chills to River. But he still opened his eyes when the sound of the metal faded away from his ears.His co-worker, Bunto was still standing there, immobile. Joshua had approached his co-worker and had passed by him.He looked at the back of the young boy whose figure was now slowly getting smaller and smaller.\u201cDid he leave? He did not punish us or anything?\u201d\u201cHaah\u2014\u201dWhen River came to terms with everything that had happened, his knees felt weak and after a moment slumped to the floor.\u201cWhat happened to you, River? How could you be so reckless?\u201dAfter glancing at River who sighed deeply like he had been scolded, Bunto shook his head.River looked towards the direction where Joshua had left and Bunto said,\u201cIf he didn\u2019t say that he was the son of Duke Agnus, would you still let him in?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 Anyway, I\u2019m glad that he did not strike me down.\u201dAfter listening to his words, Bunto held out his hands towards River and helped him up.\u201cIs he serious? About wanting to participate in Berche\u2019s bloody battle?\u201dRiver stood up and shook off the dirt on his buttocks, murmuring blankly.Berche\u2019s bloody battle.It was a violent battle, named after Prince Berche, the Avalon Empire's first imperial knight, and was initially intended to be a competition of pure skills between different battalions.However, as time passed, the rivalry passed down from previous generations of the battalions grew more intense, and the Imperial Knights' status and ranks also grew in tandem.There was a reason why this battle was called the Battle of Blood.This is because the then reigning emperor, Marcus Ben Britten, was dissatisfied with the current system and had proposed a new one.Apart from the battalion commander, the higher the battalion, the more privileged they would be. Knights from the lower battalions were free to challenge knights from higher battalions at any time, but any accidents resulting from the encounter were entirely the responsibility of the people involved.Apart from this, anybody who wanted to could participate in Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle\u2013irrespective of whether they were part of the battalions or not.Emperor Marcus' name sparked a massive uproar inside the Avalon Empire in the early days.This was because, according to Emperor Marcus' new law, any Avalonian could rise to the rank of imperial knight if they could successfully defeat any Knight from a battalion.And a Knight, if challenged, couldn\u2019t refuse no matter what.Furthermore, many people believed that the competition would only get more intense as time went on because all the members of the 1st through 3rd battalions, i.e., the top battalions, had the honor of receiving titles\u2014\u201cI never expected that the son of Duke Agnus would participate in this\u2026 Berche\u2019s bloody battle.\u201d\u201cYeah, me too. But he wanted it, so be it.\u201dBunto nodded as he looked at River.\u201cIf the loser is a knight, then he forfeits the title of \u2018Imperial Knight\u2019. Do knights who value honor more than their lives have a greater humiliation than that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why none of the outsiders who have participated in the event have survived so far. Everyone knows that if you\u2019re half hearted, you will lose and face the consequences. That\u2019s also the reason why the battle was heralded as a legend to the general public.\u201dBunto looked towards the direction where Joshua had disappeared.\u201cHe was just as old as your son\u2014\u201d River tilted his head at Bunto\u2019s comments,\u201cWasn\u2019t the treasure of the Empire, Babel von Agnus, the Duke Agnus\u2019 kid and heir? I guess that kid looks a little young for it to be Master Babel.\u201d\u201cAh\u2014\u201dBunto exclaimed as he remembered the rumors he had heard.\u201cDuke Agnus has another child\u2026 a mana user at the age of nine. At least, it was rumored that he was much younger than Young Master Babel.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRiver\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cYes\u2026 that Young Master\u2019s name is definitely something unforgettable.\u201dBunto murmured the final words in hushed tones, his gaze fixated towards a particular direction of the imperial palace.\u201cThe Empire\u2019s new talent, Joshua von Agnus.\u201dEmperor Marcus was sitting in a gorgeous chair. Jaken, the head of the Black Wind, opened his mouth in a polite manner and said, \u201cYour Majesty, Duke Geshart and Count Arie will return to the capital shortly because they\u2019re already done with their mission.\u201d\u201cNice\u2014\u201dEmperor Marcus, who replied with a delighted expression on his face, glanced at Jaken and asked,\u201cWhat about the situation in Swallow?\u201d\u201cSo far, I haven't had much of a response. I believe that they already know the situation, but we still need to keep an eye on them.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 they\u2019re the barbarians of the north, people who get excited when there\u2019s war.\u201dAs he reached the conclusion of his sentence, Emperor Marcus smirked and burst out laughing.\u201cMaybe this is because of Verona Belle Grace\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201cPrime Minister Marco is a wise man and he\u2019s been helping the Empire for a long time now.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Emperor nodded as he swallowed a lump in his throat.\u201cThis is a headache\u2026 If Demero Belle Grace had been the emperor, his mentality and physical abilities would have rivalled mine.\u201dEmperor Marcus smacked his lips, clearly very unhappy.Jaken dropped his head even lower at that point, as if he had recalled something distasteful.\u201cYour Majesty, I have one more thing to report.\u201d\u201cOne more? What is it?\u201d\u201cVig Beck Steck was reported dead.\u201d\u201cVig Beck Steck? Who\u2019s that?\u201dEmperor Marcus frowned and murmured gently.\u201cI believe I've heard of this name before. Where have I heard it?\u201d\u201cHe was the Lord of the Locke estate, a territory of the Agnus Family, and the other day he approached His Majesty for help as well.\u201d\u201cOhh! The pig!\u201dEmperor Marcus nodded, as if it had just occurred to him who the man in question was.Emperor Marcus, with an uncharacteristically solemn expression, inquired further about the incident.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that Aden von Agnus noticed our plans?\u201d\u201cAfter further investigation, I found out that the death of Vig had nothing to do with Duke Aden.\u201d\u201cOh, Duke Agnus has nothing to do with our plans then?\u201dEmperor Marcus' counter-question was respectfully answered by Jaken,\u201cYes\u2026 It was reported that the Duke had been residing here in Arcady during the time of Vig\u2019s death, and moreover, there was nothing suspicious going on in the household. In short, they were not aware of his death\u2014\u201dEmperor Marcus interrupts Jaken's long speech and asked,\u201cSo, the cause of death wasn\u2019t confirmed at all?\u201d\u201cPlease accept my apologies.\u201dBoom!Seeing Jaken slam his head on the floor in apology, the Emperor slightly waved his hand at him in forgiveness.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. The Black Wind has limits too\u2014\u201d\u201cIt was a lack of knowledge from our side.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2014\u201dEmperor Marcus, who had his chin on his hand and looked like he was mulling over something, shifted his gaze onto Jaken after a little while.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to meet him, maybe he knows something that we don\u2019t.\u201d\u201c...\u201dIn the current atmosphere, Jaken couldn\u2019t face the Emperor.He couldn\u2019t say anything because he was afraid.All he had to do now was obey the Emperor's commands.There was no authority that he could challenge from the viewpoint of the Emperor.Jaken, who had just come up with a fact, promptly opened his mouth,\u201cCome to think of it, his daughter, who was just with him in the Locke estate, just enrolled in the academy.\u201d\u201cOur academy?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dEmperor Marcus' eyes gleamed brightly in response to Jaken's response.Jaken continued speaking, \u201cShe\u2019s known as Anna Beck Steck, but her real name seems to be Anna Belle Grace.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cIt is unclear if she\u2019s his biological daughter, but she was clearly loved by him.\u201d\u201cThat's right. That\u2019s all I wanted to hear.\u201dEmperor Marcus, who was thinking of something, soon gave his orders to Jaken.\u201cI have to meet her first, bring her to me.\u201d\u201cI heed your orders!\u201dJaken, who politely bowed his head, quickly disappeared.\u201c...\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his hand was a tree branch a little thicker than the two of his fingers combined.\u201cHe did all of this crap as he pleased, then he fled to the imperial palace so eagerly, and now I\u2019m left cleaning after him.\u201dDuke Agnus burst out laughing as he exclaimed. Baron Hed, his secretary, bowed his head and apologized.\u201cWhat do you feel about the actions of your Master, Cain?\u201dDuke Agnus shifted his gaze to his front, and Cain, who was soaked in sweat, was seen.\u201cHaah, haah, haah\u2014\u201dLooking at Cain, who kept breathing heavily, Duke Agnus smiled coldly,\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. This happened because your master asked me to do this.\u201dCain sweated buckets when he heard the Duke emphasizing the words \u2018he asked me to do this\u2019 over and over again.\u2018He\u2019s brutal!\u2019Kane stumbled and took a step back, screaming inside.What Duke Agnus is currently doing, it was obviously an outburst of rage.Alarms were constantly ringing inside Cain\u2019s head.Pak.Just like how he had done until then, Duke Agnus kicked the ground and dashed towards him again.\u201cCrazy\u2014\u201dWhile watching the Duke approach Cain with tremendous speed, all Cain could do was lift his two handed sword and mutter.\u201cI\u2019m too slow!\u201dPAK.\u201cKeugh.\u201dCain, who opened his eyes wide, groaned uncomfortably due to the immense power of the branches that were now embedded in his abdomen.It was a typical branch the Duke had randomly picked up from a tree.But it became a legendary weapon when it was used by the legendary Duke Agnus himself.Flop.Duke Agnus immediately turned his head around when he saw Cain lose his balance and then fall unconscious.\u201cDid the kid do something wrong, Duke? You\u2019re clearly venting your anger out on Cain.\u201dBaron Hed looked at the unconscious Cain.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even started yet. Don\u2019t you believe that it's too early for him to fall asleep?\u201d\u201cHe\u2014\u201dDuke Agnus asked the dumbfounded Baron Hed,\u201cWhat are the twelve families doing? Especially those who had been chastised before?\u201d\u201cNothing much on the two families, but the Villas Family have filed a formal complaint since their lone heir was beaten half to death like that\u2014\u201dWith a look of being in jeopardy, Baron Hed trailed off at the end with a troubled face.As everyone knew, what had transpired between the two, would be engraved in the history of the Academy from now on.Veron Shen Villas got what he deserved after acting like a villain.Veron Shen Villas, who had been romping around without realizing that the environment was frightening, was severely affected by the bodily agony and the mental shock that had been far above anything that he had ever experienced.Of course, there were a slew of undesirable consequences as well.\u201cAre you thinking about that? Because I was about to ask if that was your intention\u2014\u201dDuke Agnus nodded in response to Baron Hed\u2019s question.\u201cMy intention?\u201d\u201cIf Marquis Villas writes us an official complaint, then we need to respond in some way to prevent any backlash in the future.\u201dThe formal complaint, which included the family's seal, was not something that was insignificant.If they somehow ignored the complaint, it was like saying that they were ignoring the complaining family as well, and an accusation like that was definitely not good news.It could even become the reason for a territorial war.Well, the Marquis would never be crazy enough to walk over the Agnus household even if he wanted to\u2026\u201cIt is certain that what happened to the Villas Family\u2019s Heir will be discussed at the quarterly Noble\u2019s competition.\u201dThen Duke Agnus would have to give an explanation to the family in front of everyone.In conclusion, this would prove to be a huge embarrassment for Duke Agnus because of his title as one of the nine stars.But,Duke Agnus, who had earlier smirked and burst out laughing, spoke as if it wasn't such a huge problem.\u201cIt\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDuke Agnus continued to speak while looking at Baron Hed who kept asking him questions with a blank expression.\u201cI\u2019m not the type of father who would care so much as to wipe his son\u2019s butthole. I\u2019m not that compassionate. And I\u2019m not the type of person to scold someone if what they did was something that suited my temperament either.\u201d\u201cMy Lord\u2026\u201dBaron Hed was about to say something when he noticed Duke Agnus' smile, which at first glance appeared mischievous.The Duke was his master\u2026someone who he had been with for a long time.\u2018Despite this, I have no idea what is going on within that head of his.\u2019\u201cHed. \u201c\u201cYes Duke?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Maquis Villas. And if he has some conscience left, then he himself will take care of the rest.\u201d\u201cYes Duke.\u201d\u201cJoshua von Agnus, he\u2019s doing a lot of things as soon as he reached the capital.\u201dDuke Agnus smiled deeply when he looked at Cain and then started walking.\u201cDuke!\u201d\u201c...\u201dDuke Agnus came to a complete halt when he heard a voice behind him.\u201cYou have a message from the Duchy. Young Master Babel was called to the capital. His Majesty wants to see how the treasure of the Empire is doing. Knight Commander Chiffon is accompanying him and they are expected to arrive in a few days.\u201dBaron Hed, who had been speaking, came to a halt.This is because, unlike before, Duke Agnus' current countenance was stiffer than ever, as he slowly turned his head.Duke Agnus opened his mouth with a shaky voice toward Baron Hed, who was now dead silent, and said,\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\"Everyone, pay attention.\"A voice full of Emperor Verona's majesty resounded at the court of the Swallow Empire.\u201cI hereby declare that the fight against the Principality of Thran to be postponed indefinitely until a separate order is received.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Your Majesty?\u201dWith an astonished face, Duke Momori opened his eyes.\u201cNo way, Your Majesty! What do you mean by giving us orders like that? I\u2019m concerned that other countries will mock our empire because we are staying quiet even though we were assaulted like this!\u201d\u201cThe Duke is correct, Your Majesty! They will look down on us and thoughts like those have to be culled immediately!\u201d\u201cPlease consider it once more, Your Majesty!\u201dWhen Prime Minister Marco noticed Emperor Verona sighing as if had been expecting the responses he got, he took a step forward.\u201cHis Majesty is not suggesting to halt it indefinitely, but merely stating that more time is required to identify the enemy\u2019s true identity!\u201d\u201cThe identity of the culprit has already been revealed, Prime Minister! What kind of identity are we still waiting for?\u201dDuke Momori clenched his fist, clearly irritated.\u201cPlease remember that you\u2019re a nobleman. This is why we are not making any progress. It is because all you think about is fighting.\u201dA voice was suddenly heard from behind them.\u201cWho is this crazy fellow\u2014\u201d\u201cWho the hell are you\u2014\u201dAs the lords of the court expressed their surprise, the red-faced Duke Momori turned his attention toward the door.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dDuke Momori\u2019s eyes widened in an instant.\u201cAre all of you here?\u201dThe man in front of the court entrance smiled brightly as he drew the people's attention.He appeared to be a young man, perhaps 30 years old.The hair on his head resembled a dark red blood rather than a flaming red color.The audience was creeped out by his bloodshot eyes, which were the same color as his hair.Obviously, his clear features were admirable, but the attractiveness he emitted was far from pure, and it rather displayed an image of decadence.This kind of atmosphere was possessed by only one individual in the Swallow Empire.Unlike his youthful glow that was exhibited outside, his real age was much older than that.He was one of the nine stars and a subordinate of the past emperor, Cerona belle Grace.\u201cArchduke Lucifer.\u201dArchduke Lucifer smiled cruelly as he heard Emperor Verona mumble in a quiet voice.\u201cI greet the sun of the empire.\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u201dArchduke Lucifer bowed properly to Emperor Verona, who was staring silently.The court became so quiet that even the sound of a needle falling could be heard.Nobles who had been energetically shouting at the Emperor earlier, were now quiet as dead mice.\u201cAre you a complete moron?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014\u201dAt the stark words of Archduke Lucifer, Duke Momori stuttered with a puzzled look.\u201cWhich country do you think this occurrence will benefit the most?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201dArchduke Lucifer continued to talk even before Duke Momori finished his sentence,\u201cDo you think that the new Prince of Thran will leave behind such a mistake if he was behind the incident?\u201dArchduke Lucifer smiled coldly as he looked at Duke Momori\u2019s face as he mumbled his excuses.\u201c...\u201dArchduke Lucifer, who caught a glimpse of Duke Momori, who was trembling from the unforgivable insult, now cast a glance around the entire room.\u201cDoes anyone else have the same thought?\u201d\u201c...\u201dArchduke Lucifer smirked and broke out laughing as he swept through the nobility of Court who had not responded to his question.\u201cBut since you still have your doubts, I\u2019ll explain it to you.\u201d\u201c...!\u201dThe nobility opened their eyes wide when Archduke Lucifer spoke quietly to them.\u201cA lot of countries would definitely benefit if this situation depleted our military might, and among them\u2014\u201dArchduke Lucifer licked his lips.\u201cExcept for the Hubalt Empire, which is preoccupied with the Pope's election, we can limit all the potential countries who stand to gain the most into a single location, and I\u2019m not even going to think about the other trash countries who would dare try to meddle with us behind our backs.\u201dAfter speaking, Archduke Lucifer turned to Emperor Verona with his arms wide open.\u201cDon't you think so, Your Majesty?\u201dEmperor Verona grumbled as he looked at Archduke Lucifer, who inquired with a light smile as if he was attempting to turn all the attention to him,Prime Minister Marco eventually whispered the name with a hard face on behalf of Emperor Verona, who now had a concerned expression on his face.\u201cThe Avalon empire.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the boisterous splendor of the Imperial Palace dwarfed the Duke\u2019s manor. It would be easy to immediately get lost on your first visit, but Joshua walked forwards without an ounce of hesitation.It\u2019s still the same. The buildings haven\u2019t changed at all, just the people in them.Joshua was moving at a quick pace despite the white plate armor he was wearing. It was very heavy for a child\u2014especially because it was full-body armor\u2014but the lightening magic made it actually very lightweight.It\u2019s not so bad without the helmet.\u00a0Joshua smiled to himself. He wouldn\u2019t express it openly, but he was thrilled to receive the ring from Duke Agnus.He\u2019d been stopped by the guards many times along the way, but, thanks to the Duke\u2019s insignia, he hadn\u2019t encountered much trouble.The 11th and 12th battalions are just mercenaries but with titles. They\u2019re battlefield warriors, but their superiors treat them like commodities; nothing more, nothing less.\u00a0Joshua sighed. In some ways, the 11th and 12th Battalions were the driving force for the Empire\u2019s ferocity. The two of them represented the very essence of the Emperor\u2019s policy.I just need to reach the 1st Battalion and become commander. Maybe as a bonus, I\u2019ll receive a title.Joshua had made preliminary plans before he\u2019d arrived at the Imperial Palace. Five years was all he needed, with the help of Bronto.\u201cAssuming there\u2019s no problems, of course.\u201d He clenched his fist.This was an opportunity in a way. With new powers he\u2019d never even imagined before, this place was an ideal location to stabilize his powers over the next five years.\u201cOh, this place is\u2026\u201d The towering inner walls of the Imperial Palace loomed before him, protected by iron-clad guards.\u201cThis looks like a prison, even now.\u201d Though ostensibly, it was to protect the Imperial Family\u2019s palaces.Though he couldn\u2019t see inside, the scent of flowers drifting over the walls was enough for Joshua to remember what lay within.An expansive flower garden, surrounding a pure white palace.\u201cHwahwa Palace\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s chest throbbed; when he\u2019d still lived in the Imperial Palace, the owner of Hwahwa Palace was very special to him. Despite her peerless bloodline, she had a particular attitude about herself and was despised and alienated by many nobles.So much had happened in such a short period of time. Joshua\u2019s cold, distant personality had faded away; all that was left was thankfulness. Gratitude. Not the clumsy feelings that came from love or sympathy, but a deep, heartfelt gratitude.She saw Joshua as a human, not just a mercenary.Joshua bit his lip and shook his head. \u201cI need to go\u2026\u201dI wanted to visit while I was here, but I can\u2019t right now.\u00a0He had too much to do.\u00a0But a quick peek probably wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone.People, however, are not in control of their destiny.\u201cIs somebody there?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice drifted over the walls. Joshua knew this voice, though she was much younger than he remembered.Joshua struggled with himself for a moment before abruptly turning around and walking away.\u201cPlease wait for a second!\u201dJoshua couldn\u2019t resist that anguished voice and halted.\u201cI have no idea who you are, but please tell me\u2026 Wait, can you just listen to me for a second?\u201d When she didn\u2019t hear any movement on the other side of the wall, the woman continued speaking with a bright tone. \u201cMy name is Sersiarin von Britten\u2014if it\u2019s not too rude, can I ask for yours?\u201d\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Joshua bit his lip. \u201cJoshua\u2026 Joshua Sander.\u201dThe bonds of their past life were rekindled, though the wall between them may be too thick to cross.At the same time, another group approached the magnificent Imperial Palace.A knight clad in silver full plate-mail eyed the towering palace appearing in the distance.\u201cFrom this point onwards, we are within the Imperial Family\u2019s safe zone. In a few hours, we shall arrive at the Imperial Palace\u2014as you can see over there. Is that acceptable, Young Master Babel?\u201d\u201cThank you for your work, Sir Chiffon.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a privilege to assist the Young Master in this way.\u201d Chiffon gave the emaciated boy a worried look.\u201cI haven\u2019t been here\u2026 since the Academy.\u201d\u201cPlease, do not be concerned.

This is why he called you here\u2014he wanted to see how much you\u2019ve grown, and to marvel at the genius of the Empire.\u201d\u201cGenius\u2026\u201d Babel shook his head, grimacing.Chiffon bit his lip\u2014he knew what the young Duke-to-be was thinking.It\u2019s that bastard who appeared out of nowhere. I can\u2019t even look at him without remembering he\u2019s a pesky maid\u2019s child.\u00a0Chiffon\u2019s eyes crackled with a terrible chilliness.\u201cYoung Master Babel\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Babel tilted his head at him.\u201cAlways remember: I, and all the vassals, are with you. I believe I can say that with confidence.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sir Chiffon.\u201d Babel smiled. However, a shadow flickered over his face.Chiffon clenched his fists. \u201cIf\u2026\u201dBabel eyed him curiously when he didn\u2019t continue.\u201cYou know\u2026 what if\u2026\u201d\u201cTake a deep breath and speak, Sir Chiffon.\u201d Babel smiled encouragingly.\u201cIf your father was not your real father, what would you do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Sir Chiffon?\u201d Babel\u2019s face hardened, and Chiffon hiccuped when the knight realized what he\u2019d said.This atmosphere\u2026 How did this happen?\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Sir Chiffon is getting at,\u201d Babel said with a smile. \u201cI usually\u2014\u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s nothing, haha.\u201d Chiffon hastily fished for an excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s my colleague\u2014how would you feel if you were in his shoes?\u201dDamn it, what a blunder\u2026\u00a0Fortunately for him, Babel\u2019s expression relaxed.\u201cWas there such a person in the Red Knights? I\u2019d be quite worried. Is there anything I can do to be of assistance\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Young Master need not bother\u2026 haha\u2026\u201d Chiffon sighed in relief.\u201cI would be shocked, but\u2026 would it matter?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cEven if my father turned out to be someone else, I don\u2019t see why it would be a big enough issue to disrupt my life.\u201d\u201cYou really think so?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Babel nodded without hesitation. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it should matter; regardless, wouldn\u2019t both fathers be pleased if I lived my life to the fullest?\u201dAh, I see\u2026 The Young Master has matured.\u00a0Chiffon\u2019s face glowed with emotion.\u201cWe\u2019ll be late if we don\u2019t hurry,\u201d Babel warned him. \u201cThe message must have reached the Imperial Palace by now.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d Chiffon turned to address the rest of the group. \u201cPrepare to depart!\u201d\u201cYes Sir!\u201d More than a hundred knights of Agnus responded to Chiffon at once.Chiffon glanced one more time at Babel as they departed.In the fading sunlight, his figure seemed large and manly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The way he\u2019d introduced himself made it clear he wasn\u2019t an aristocrat. No doubt she was confused to find a commoner wandering through the Imperial Palace.\u201cYou have a beautiful name\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard it in a book. Sanders, a flower that only blossoms in the Tripia region in the extreme east of the Empire; it\u2019s said to be more beautiful than a rose in full bloom, but its meaning in the language of flowers couldn\u2019t be more tragic\u2014\u201d\u201cYou need to stop.\u201d Joshua frowned.\u201cWhat are you saying\u2026?\u201d Sersiarin was perplexed. \u201cDid I say something wrong? If that\u2019s the case, you have my sincere apologies. Please forgive my rudeness.\u201d\u201cYou did nothing wrong.\u201d He shook his head firmly. \u201c...By the way,\u201d he asked after a moment of silence, \u201cis it uncomfortable going out of the palace without an escort? Are you alright going out alone?\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201dJoshua smiled sourly. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard the story of the beautiful yet tragic Princess of the Hwahwa Palace.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Sersiarin gasped. \u201cCould you tell me more about the rumors you heard about me?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Hwahwa Palace is secluded from the world; there lives a beautiful princess whose looks are unmatched in all of history\u2026\u201d Joshua trailed off into a sigh. \u201c...but it is said that she is blind.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2026 I never expected\u2014 I see.\u201dThis is why I didn\u2019t want to see you right now.\u00a0Joshua shook his head. Sersiarin sounded so lonely.Joshua was well aware of the Imperial Family\u2019s hidden troubles; the reality was, the Princess behind the wall suffered the most.The most likely reason the Emperor imprisons his own daughter is because she\u2019s disabled.\u201cThe eyes that see the truth\u2026 that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d Joshua mumbled, too quiet for anyone else to hear.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel sorry for me.\u201d Sersiarin\u2019s voice was laced with bitterness.Joshua cursed himself.\u00a0I know my mistakes\u2014\u201cI think I understand Young Master Joshua\u2019s reaction a little. The rumors\u2026 After all, my father has a reputation for being overprotective, right? But\u2026 that\u2019s not true. I can\u2019t go out because I\u2019m weak; I don\u2019t know when I could fall unconscious\u2026\u201dJoshua bit his lips until they bled.Master or not, Sersiarin saw right through the Emperor. She almost certainly knew the Emperor\u2019s true motivation for imprisoning her from the very beginning\u2014and the awful truth of the great tragedy that even some of the Imperial Family were unaware of.If it were me, would I have acted like her when I found out the truth?\u00a0Joshua shook his head. The reality was, it wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you could deal with in a rational manner.\u201cWhy am I crying\u2026\u201d Sersiarin could be heard sniffling behind the wall. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but why does it feel like you lost something\u2014\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you sad?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Joshua fumbled for words for a moment before resolving himself.He had to make sure. Had she really known, all this time?As for helping her, he\u2019d decide afterwards.\u201cDon\u2019t you know why you were born with a disability\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe tragedy of your birth.\u201dShe didn\u2019t answer, but that told Joshua everything. She knew, even before they\u2019d met in his past life.\u201cDamn it\u2014!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the usual place for the Emperor to receive guests; it was a private annex in the back corner of the Palace.\u201cI greet His Majesty Marcus von Britten, and sun of the Empire and the great Master of Avalon.\u201d\u201cAre you the messenger\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d She bowed. \u201cMy name is Anna belle Grace.\u201dEmperor Marcus smiled warmly at the young lady. \u201cDid you enjoy my present?\u201d\u201cI am very grateful to His Majesty for his gift.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d Marcus clapped his hands and laughed.\u201cBy the way,\u201d he whispered furtively. \u201cI\u2019ve heard things are a bit complicated\u2026\u201dAnna\u2019s expression tightened.\u201cHas he finally shown himself, after all these years?\u201d\u201cIt was just a normal rumor\u2014Avalon has Duke Aden von Agnus, and Swallow has Archduke Lucifer.\u201d\u201cIs there any way out of this?\u201d Emperor Marcus leaned back with a tranquil smile on his face. \u201cNo matter how good of a messenger your father is, it\u2019s not going to be easy on him.\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Emperor Marcus was surprised. It seemed the girl had the same sentiments as her father. No doubt it had to do with the peculiar spiritual bond between them.I\u2019ve never seen them say anything so weakly in all the years we\u2019ve known each other.He didn\u2019t call someone a \u201cmessenger\u201d on a whim. Her father was an undefeated general\u2014simply unbeatable.Draxia belle Grace.And now, I just want it more\u2026\u00a0Marcus\u2019s grin stretched wider.He was of the same mind. Ulabis\u2019s appearance was an entirely unexpected variable\u2014everything went wrong as soon as he appeared. Even the Emperor didn\u2019t expect the Swallow Empire\u2019s latest defeat.\u201cAfter this, how dare you say you\u2019re not confident.\u201dAnna struggled to breath, shivering uncontrollably.\u201cYou were one hundred percent confident in victory. That was why I showed you mercy.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor\u2014\u201d Anna clutched her neck desperately. With a low level of mana resistance, she was gasping for air.The Emperor reigned in his mana, allowing the blue-faced girl to fall to the ground.\u201cUgh! She coughed violently. \u201cHaack! Thank you for your eternal kindness\u2014\u201dThe Emperor laughed at her pain.\u201cDo not interfere,\u201d he said. \u201cI will reward you with the Duke\u2019s seat.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Anna\u2019s eyes were wide with astonishment. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d\u201cYour father would understand.\u201dAnna bit her lip as comprehension dawned.Eliminating the border guards was unnecessary. That is to say\u2026Even this is a game to Emperor Marcus. He\u2019s insane, a madman obsessed with murder and war.Anna quickly pivoted.\u201cBut this is too much, Your Majesty. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re able to accept.\u201dMarcus\u2019s lips curled upwards. \u201cJaken.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dAnna broke into a cold sweat when a black figure appeared out of nowhere.\u201cWould you mind answering for me? Who dares to stand in the way of what I want to do in this Empire?\u201d\u201cEverything is done according to His Majesty\u2019s wishes,\u201d the spy replied without hesitation.\u201cTell your father not to be concerned,\u201d the Emperor said with a smile. \u201cWe will proceed as planned.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\u201cNo stopping. Not until it\u2019s over.\u201dThe Emperor turned to Jaken.\u201cJaken. Prepare in secret; make sure nobody notices.\u201d\u201cI heed and obey.\u201d\u201cI am not a patient person,\u201d Marcus said to Anna. \u201cI will not be kept waiting for long.\u201d\u201cWe will return as soon as possible.\u201dEmperor Marcus stood up and walked away, amusement dancing on his lips.Anna, too frightened to even raise her head, was left to shiver in fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course this implies the generation before his sons.Fearing that the Emperor Marcus' pure bloodline would be cut off, there were only a few relatives who could be termed the Imperial Family at the time, and they took a very frightening and extreme move.\u2018That is the tragedy of the Britten family\u2026 and throughout the Avalon Empire\u2019s history, it will be remembered as the darkest catastrophe.\u2019As he grumbled inside, Joshua's eyes dropped down.Beyond the wall, Princess Sersiarin was the first casualty of that disaster.\u2018There was a good reason why the Princess was born with such congenital impairment\u2026 because of the inbreeding of the Brittens.\u2019Joshua gave a sour smile and shifted his gaze to the huge wall in front of him.Princess Sersiarin, if his memory serves him correctly,Emperor Marcus and his cousin had a child as a result of incest.And thus the princess was a really pure blooded royal.\u201cPlease tell me! Please tell me how much you know\u2014!\u201d\u201cPrincess Sersiarin?\u201d\u201c...\u201dJoshua took a step back when another woman's voice came from behind the wall.\u201cAre you talking to the wall?\u201d\u201cOh! No\u2026 what\u2019s going on Ellen?\u201dPrincess Sersiarin mumbled the inquiry, unable to mask her shame.\u201cYour health\u2026 I know you\u2019re not feeling well yet you\u2019re still here. Let\u2019s go in now, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI see\u2014\u201dJoshua, who grasped the general atmosphere, sighed briefly and turned around.'We will meet again when the time is right.'Joshua murmured to himself and started walking slowly.Joshua's figure swiftly vanished from the scene, leaving behind the wall that soared high as if it might cut through the sky.'I don\u2019t believe it. He seemed to know everything.'As she returned her gaze to the flower garden full of vibrant flowers, the girl's face was flushed with surprise.The girl was sitting beside the window, cushioned under a soft pillow while reminiscing the earlier encounter.The girl's attractiveness could not be hidden even though her eyes, which are an important element of her appearance. But she closed her lids and frowned.Is she ten years old now?Her blonde hair shone beautifully in the sunlight, as if to boast that she inherited royal blood, and her small face, straight nose, and dense features below that were in perfect harmony with her little face.It\u2019s like she has never been outside the sun before. It seems life if she really did go outside, her pristine white skin will melt.And even though she\u2019s angry, everyone will still think of her as an adorable doll.Due to her young age, she was still simply a doll-like kid who everyone would admire at least once, but she is on her way to becoming one of the empire's most beautiful girls.\u201cJoshua\u2026 Sanders?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dEllen, the private maid combing her hair from behind, inclined her head so she could comprehend Princess Sersiarin's little mutter.\u201cHave you ever heard the name Joshua Sanders, Ellen?\u201d\u201cJoshua\u2026 Sanders?\u201dEllen's skepticism became more pronounced.\u201cI'm not sure? No middle name implies commoners, right? Do you know someone with that name?\u201d'Is he a peasant?'Princess Sersiarin snorted a little when she heard Ellen's remarks out of her one ear.Ordinary people who have no knowledge of the whereabouts of the imperial family must be oblivious of this secret that only a few members of the royal family are aware of.\u201cAh, now that I think about it\u2014\u201dEllen clapped her hands for a little moment, as if contemplating something.\u201cI was curious if it was familiar, but I believe I've heard the name Joshua before.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dPrincess Serciarin inquired, her voice anxious.Because there were so many people's names and their families in the Empire, the chances that they were the same individual were slim.\u2018I can always double check\u2026 since I remember the feeling that he gave me even if he was beyond the wall\u2026 I will definitely know if it\u2019s him.\u2019Princess Sersiarin's face was filled with confidence.In any case, the presence or absence of a wall didn't matter to her.She was still blind even if there was no wall.\u201cTell me, Ellen, When was the first time you heard the name?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014 It\u2019s because I heard something on the way here.\u201d\u201cPlease speak.\u201dEllen, who had been afraid to respond, suddenly sighed in response to Princess Sersiarin's desperate face.\u201cThe knights said that we have a new talent with the name of Joshua.\u201d\u201cYou mean one of the people who can be considered as the continent\u2019s most gifted?\u201dEllen smiled and nodded.\u201cYes\u2026 and the other one was Babel von Agnus. His Majesty was very happy because this could be good for our Empire.\u201d\u201cSo his name was Joshua\u2014\u201d\u2018I expected him to be an unusual person, but I never imagined that he would be a great person because his voice sounded so young.\u2019Selene spoke up after seeing princess Sersiarin contemplating.\u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed yet\u2026 because in order to be a solid little star, everyone must acknowledge him.\u201d\u201cYou mean because of the fact that he was nominated means that there is a huge chance of it being true, right?\u201d\u201cThat is true\u2026 because people who had been nominated before excelled in the Reinhardt competition that attracts people from all across the land.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201dSelene continued speaking with a strong expression on her face as Princess Sersiarin gently nodded her head.\u201cHowever\u2026 According to the knights, the majority of aristocracy are opposed to this topic.\u201d\u201cWhat are you suddenly saying?\u201dPrincess Sersiarin asked a query with a tilt of her head.\u201cThey say that aristocats are wary because those geniuses has big chance to be nine stars in the future, and given the fact that there\u2019s two little stars from one family is so\u2014\u201dPrincess Sersiarin flinched and shook at Selene's following remarks.\u2018Two little stars from the same family?\u2019Was Joshua related to the other two geniuses?There was only one person\u2026\u201cAll well, then. Maybe that person named Joshua\u2014\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSelene vigorously nodded and finally continued her last comments.\u201cJoshua von Agnus is his full name. He is claimed to be Duke Aden von Agnus's second son, the Empire's pride.\u201dJust now, an unexpected visitor appeared at Duke Agnus' office.\u201cI greet the Duke.\u201d\u201cChiffon? What brings you here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014\u201dChiffon threw a regretful grimace towards the end of his speech.\u2018I couldn't speak the truth since the Duchess had ordered it.\u2019\u201cHow come there isn't a response?\u201d\u201cPlease accept my apologies, Your highness.\u201dChiffon knelt on the floor right away.Duke Agnus raised the atmosphere.Chiffon gulped hard when his body started shaking violently against his will.\u201cI inquired. What brings you here as a Knight of the duke?\u201d\u201cOh Duke\u2026 Please, don\u2019t be enraged.\u201d\u201cValderas den Chiffon, tell me who is the Lord you serve.\u201dChiffon bit his lips when he realized that he needed to answer the question.\u201cAh, Duke Aden von Agnus, the big star over Avalon, is my master\u2014!\u201dChiffon couldn't take it any longer and slammed his head on the marble tiled floor.Duke Agnus's ferocious fury toward him grew stronger.\u201cI'm well aware that you pay more attention to Vanessa than mine.\u201d\u201cThis is a misunderstanding\u2026 Keugh\u2014\u201d\u201cI decided to leave you alone since you\u2019re doing well with your job, but you crossed the line this time\u2026 do you plead guilty?\u201d\u201cPlease accept my apologies\u2014\u201d\u201cExplain why you should be forgiven.\u201dChiffon frantically shook his head.\u2018Make sure you don't get this one wrong.\u2019\u00a0he kept telling himself.When it came to blunders, the master was not particularly forgiving.Now is the time to speak the truth.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor... he ordered a private meeting with Young Master Babel.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI need to guard Young Master Babel back and forth the Duchy\u2026 AAAACKK!\u201dChiffon heaved a hard cough as the energy that had crushed his entire body vanished like a lie.\u201cIs it accurate what you just said?\u201d\u201cI swear on my life, there isn't a single lie.\u201d\u201cAside from that, what else have you failed to inform me of?\u201dChiffon instantly straightened his stance in response to Duke Agnus' question.\u201cThere is no such thing!\u201d\u201cYou will, without a doubt, have to think and respond. If something similar occurs again\u2014\u201d\u2018I could predict enough even if I didn't listen to his next words.\u2019Chiffon slammed his head against the ground once more.\u201cNot at all, Duke! Have faith in me!\u201d\u201c...\u201dAfter casting a frigid glare at Chiffon's back, Duke Agnus rose to his feet.\u201cCan you tell me where Babel is now?\u201d\u201cI only know that he will have a private meeting with the Emperor and nothing else.\u201d\u201cAlone with the Emperor\u2014?\u201dDuke Agnus' impression hardened even more.\u201cChiffon, I can only give you one piece of advice, as a lord.\u201d\u201cHaah! Please say so.\u201d\u201cIf you want to pursue that plan of yours, learn how to grope the string that won\u2019t break. Because if you hold onto a string that will, you and that person will stumble together\u2026 You must know how to strive harder as you grow older.\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2019s advice, I will engrave it deep into these bones!\u201d\u201cGo rest for a moment.\u201d\u201cAll right, I'll accept your orders!\u201dChiffon quickly followed suit.Duke Agnus left the office and Chiffon alone.He didn\u2019t even look back at the laying Chiffon on the ground.\u201cDamn this.\u201dChiffon let out a furious cuss word as he was left alone.\u2018I know how to cut the line myself. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing now.\u2019If he insist on using the iron fist,\u201cWho will laugh at the end, my lord, I\u2019d like to see with my own two eyes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The remainders\u2014the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Battalions1\u2014guarded the outskirts of the Palace. A unique formation, to be sure, but it was undoubtedly the most practical approach to guarding the Palace; each Battalion worked as a single organism to protect the Imperial Palace.That aside, Joshua was headed towards the massive Imperial Fortress, directly opposite from the Imperial Palace. He could hear the crowd\u2019s cheering growing louder as he approached.It\u2019s been a long time,\u00a0Joshua grumbled\u2014but he was grinning. In some ways, his plans weren\u2019t so different from what he\u2019d done in his previous life.\u00a0I also came here before entering the Imperial Palace, before becoming particularly powerful.\u00a0Joshua cast a hazy glance into the horizon, much like his old mercenary buddies.\u00a0I could proudly say that it was a job that was ours\u2014perfectly.Two massive training halls appeared as he closed in on his goal; they were the training grounds of the 11th and 12th Battalions. Despite their reputation as \u201cbastards\u201d with no connections, they had remained here without change for several decades.\u201cARGHHHH!\u201d Weapons clashed.\u201cAHAHAHA! Are you feeling good, Ranger? Is that it? Does it feel good to have a bastard pinning you now?\u201d\u201cDo you hear yourself?

You prideful bastard\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why His Majesty said that all the fools must be mercenaries! You don\u2019t even know how the battalions are divided up!\u201d\u201cWhat? Did you just call me a fool? Scum!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one thing that never changes,\u201d Joshua remarked with a hearty chuckle as he passed by the boisterous voices and clatter of metal.Eventually, Joshua arrived at his destination. One of the two enormous training halls, fit to house dozens of people, was empty, as if it had been shut down for the day. The other hall was packed to the brim; hundreds of people watched two men exchanging blows.\u201cLooks like today is the day,\u201d Joshua muttered, running his eyes over the hall.The audience was split in two, each cheering for a different knight.\u201cHey Ranger! I bet all of this month\u2019s pocket money on you, so you\u2019d better win! Slam that guy into the ground! Show them how the 11th Battalion plays!\u201d\u201cKases! If you lose, I\u2019m gonna be kicked out of the house! I bet everything my wife and I have! Save me!\u201dThe raspy voice made Joshua smile. The lowest battalions, the 11th and 12th, used to have regular fights like these. It was supposed to foster companionship through competition\u2014but it backfired.\u201cAh, it\u2019s been so long\u2026\u201d Joshua smiled warmly and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this badly.\u201dAs he was musing, one of the swords was launched away and went crashing into the corner of the training hall. The victor pointed his sword and laughed, while the loser looked desperate.\u201cARGH!\u201d\u201cMy word\u2014\u201d\u201cI knew it! I knew Ranger wouldn\u2019t let anyone from a lower battalion sully the 11th Battalion\u2019s honor! But, uh\u2026 this is very shameful.\u201dThe loser threw away his pride and clutched at the victor\u2019s pants.\u201cBrother Ranger! Save me just this once\u2014I mean, you know my wife, right? Everything I do annoys her and I can feel my dick shrinking in shame. Since I lost, she\u2019s going to take everything from me. I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d\u201cWhat? Look at this dunderhead, heheh. You willing to take a chance?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Ranger looked down on Kases mockingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice you, I thought you were a bug. What were you saying? Do you a favor, hmmmm?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! Ranger, you do realize that if you save him, he\u2019ll have more chances to attack you in the future?\u201d One of the other knights patted Ranger on the shoulder.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cI know how to repay my favors, so please,\u201d Kases begged. \u201cHelp me, Brother Ranger, please\u2026\u201dThe audience on one side was laughing their heads off; on the other side, they were shaking their heads.\u201cKases is a disgrace to the 12th Battalion.\u201d\u201cUgh, that thing isn\u2019t a knight. He\u2019s worse than a bug.\u201dJoshua slowly made his way into the middle of the mob.\u201cOh? Who is this kid?\u201d\u201cWhere did you come from, kid?\u201d\u201cDid some noble brat get lost on the way to the playground\u2026\u201d\u201cKid\u2026\u201d Ranger eyed the boy. \u201cThis is not a playground for the likes of you. Did you get lost?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m in the right place.\u201dRanger scowled at him. It was clear he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cI\u2019m here for a reason\u2026\u201d Joshua smiled cruelly, capturing the mob\u2019s attention. Their faces lit up, eager to see what he had to say. \u201cI\u2019m here for\u2026 Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle.\u201dThe atmosphere was instantly dampened, as if they\u2019d been splashed with cold water.Two men were hiking through the dense woodlands near the eastern gates of Arcadia. They arrived at a small, vacant lot.\u201cThis is it,\u201d the huge, middle-aged man on the left whispered, picking up a handful of dust. He had a low-pitched, pleasant voice that suited his stature nicely. He had a body like a boulder and a strong, plain demeanor. However, his true identity was hardly pleasant: this was Marcus Lindblom, the Earth Magician.\u201cHuh.\u201d The other man peered at Marcus\u2019s palm. \u201cThe dust is different here.\u201d He smiled.This man looked to have not yet reached his 30s. He had cool features, light-green hair, and a face that promised mischief. Theta Leyers\u2014he, like Marcus Lindblom, was one of the Seven Magicians. Theta held the Storm seat, earning him the epithet \u201cMagician of the Wind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not dirt, Theta,\u201d Marcus said.\u201cI suppose not. Would it make you feel better if I called it \u2018ash?\u2019\u201dA sudden gust of wind blew the dust out of Marcus\u2019s hand, drifting into the air as the Earth Magician watched.\u201cMay Damocles\u2019s blessings be upon you\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much!\u201d Theta clapped his hands together in emphasis. \u201cYour prayers are disrespecting the dead. May his soul stay with us even if his body is now dust.\u201d\u201cTheta.\u201d Marcus chastised Theta in hushed tones.\u201cLet\u2019s just go and investigate, shall we?\u201d Theta shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out in a long time.\u201dMarcus frowned. \u201cYou want to ditch so soon? The identity of the murder is not yet revealed.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you? There\u2019s a lot of evidence out here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dTheta straightened up.\u201cClose your eyes and imagine the wind rushing past you,\u201d he instructed Marcus. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Marcus looked bewildered, but when he saw Theta\u2019s solemn expression he slowly closed his eyes. Theta was perpetually naughty, Marcus knew, but every now and then he could be deadly serious.His eyes were only closed for a moment.\u201cThere\u2019s no mana?\u201dMana is naturally distributed throughout the atmosphere. It would be normal for mana to be concentrated in the heart of a dense forest like this\u2014however, there was not a smidgen to be found. What\u2019s more, it was only in a single place, about 10 feet away from the pair.\u201cNo way\u2026 A mana vacuum\u2026\u201d Marcus was incredulous; he was well aware of the significance of this phenomenon.\u201cA vacuum manifests itself in two ways. One is a naturally occurring phenomenon\u2014however, in a forest like this\u2014right next to the capital no less\u2014there\u2019s no way it wouldn\u2019t have been discovered already.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one possibility. Circle rush.\u201d Theta nodded firmly. \u201cIf the heart of a Class 6 or higher magician is severely wounded\u2026\u201dTheta mimed an explosion with his hands.\u201cTotal obliteration in a one kilometer radius. The problem is, this area is too clean; it only happened once, and recently.\u201d\u201cStone\u2026\u201d Marcus groaned.\u201cYes\u2026 It\u2019s like the Primordial Stone Magma\u2019s effect.\u201d Theta\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cThis is his destination, and where he died\u2026 but this is a forest. If he was pursued, he would\u2019ve left traces. He came here of his own will.\u201d Theta gestured wildly.\u201cDo you understand? The perpetrator\u2014it was an individual, not a group. Jack was following Bronto. The vacuum indicates he found it. Assuming the worst case scenario\u2026\u201d He looked around. \u201cThe person who killed him was the one who took Bronto. By finding the stone, we find the murderer.\u201dNo idea what happened to 4-6.\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98\u201cWait a minute\u2014what did the kid say?\u201d\u201cAm I hearing this right? Is he talking about the Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle we\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\u201cHey, kid. That\u2019s not funny. Where did you hear that?\u201dWhile the 11th and 12th Battalion\u2019s murmuring grew, Ranger calmly stepped forwards.\u201cKid, you\u2019re sure about what you just said?\u201dJoshua\u2019s lips remained sealed.\u201cHngh.\u201d Ranger stretched his hand out to Joshua. \u201cTell me where you live and we\u2019ll escort you out of the Palace. You must\u2019ve gotten lost or something\u2014\u201d He suddenly stopped. \u201cA Deon Ring? Am I seeing this right? Is that really a Deon Ring?\u201d Ranger seemed amused.Joshua infused mana into the ring, drawing surprised mumbles from the knights. Soon, his pristine white armor bathed them in its dazzling light.\u201cThe Knight\u2019s Tomb!\u201d\u201cDoes that kid belong to Duke Agnus?\u201d\u201cWith an artifact like that, he must at least be a blood relative, right?\u201dRanger cautiously opened his mouth. \u201cAre you a child of Duke Agnus?\u201d\u201cI am Joshua von Agnus; I\u2019m here for the Bloody Battle.\u201dA deafening stillness fell over the stunned men.\u201cA child of Avalon, Joshua von Agnus,\u201d Ranger whispered. \u201cAn unprecedented genius who could control mana before the age of ten. Rumors say he was born in the Agnus Duchy.\u201d The knight eyed Joshua. \u201cIs that right, Young Master?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you know why Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle is practically a fairytale now?\u201d\u201cIf an Imperial Knight loses, their position is immediately revoked; on the other hand, the winner is promoted to Imperial Knight, regardless of their former rank. However, whatever happens during the fight is between the fighters and no one else\u2014such is the will of His Majesty, Marcus von Britten. Disobedience is taken as treason.\u201d Joshua stared Ranger dead in the eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 It seems like you\u2019re well aware, but you still want to join?\u201dJoshua nodded without hesitation.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Ranger looked around and sighed. \u201cIs anyone willing to take part?\u201dThe knights quickly averted their gaze, leaving the training hall quiet enough to hear a needle drop. They knew how brutal the battle would be.If we win it\u2019ll be a huge problem. If the Young Master is seriously injured, there\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019ll let it go given the nobles\u2019 pride.\u00a0Ranger groaned to himself.\u00a0Of course, we are protected by His Majesty\u2026Above all, Duke Aden von Agnus, the great star of Avalon, was held in the highest esteem by the knights of the 11th and 12th Battalions. Who would want to do something that would cast them in a bad light to their role model?He just had to come when the Battalion Commanders were gone\u2026Ranger gave Kases, his opponent, a pained look.\u201cUgh\u2026 Did you hit something weird, Sir Ranger?\u201d Kases clutched his stomach. \u201cWhy am I suddenly in pain\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ranger shook his head, \u201cbut we need a C-Class Knight at least. That\u2019s the best we can do to stop someone from getting hurt.\u201d\u201cAre you gonna fight me?\u201d Joshua quietly asked as Ranger stepped forward.\u201cExactly. But I\u2019m not that merciful\u2014\u201d\u201cHow do you see yourself, in this situation?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ranger frowned.\u201cI heard that you\u2014the 11th Battalion\u2014aren\u2019t like the other battalions, but it seems like there\u2019s quite the similarity between you and the 12th. But the problem is\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s face reddened, but he couldn\u2019t hold in his laughter. \u201cPeople with a recommendation from the Imperial Family climb the ranks quickly, but I guess that\u2019s not the case for you, right?\u201d\u201cYoung Master\u2026 Wh-what are you saying?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have the ability\u2014or maybe the courage\u2014to beat the top battalions, so you just pity yourself. As for the rest? Just look at them: they look terrified because they don\u2019t know what to do. Aren\u2019t you just a bunch of cowards?\u201d\u201cShut the hell up!\u201dJoshua\u2019s words cut deep, and stung like salt in the wound. The fact was, they tried their hardest to ignore the truth lest it wipe out the final vestiges of the 11th and 12th Battalions\u2019 pride.Like Ranger, the half-curious, half-interested mood had disappeared from the knights\u2019 faces. Right now, they were openly hostile to Joshua.\u201cRanger,\u201d Kases said with a cool, quiet voice, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201dUnlike Ranger\u2019s cool impression, Kases\u2019s voice held a frightening edge.\u201cKases?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tolerate this kind of attitude. This kid needs to learn that a knight\u2019s pride and honor isn\u2019t something he can trample over.\u201d Kases stepped towards Joshua. \u201cYoung Master, oh, my Young Master. Please don\u2019t complain when you get hurt.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d Joshua gasped and laughed again.He couldn\u2019t be more insulting. Kases finally snapped.\u201cHow dare you. This brat has no humility! Do you get it from your surname? I\u2019ll tell you now, it\u2019s not gonna help you in the future!\u201dThe other knights joined in, battering Kases\u2019s ears with their shouts.\u201cKases, you better do it right! If you\u2019re planning on holding back, then get out! I\u2019ll do it for you!\u201d\u201cThat kid shouldn\u2019t flap his gob! Make him pay by crushing those jaws!\u201d\u201cMake sure he gets what he deserves for asking for Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle!\u201dThe knight in question slowly retrieved his blade from the corner where it had landed.\u201cI\u2019ll give it my all. I\u2019ll crush your sword and show you how big the sky is.\u201d With that, Kases began injecting mana into his sword, tearing the air open as it coated his blade. It wasn\u2019t the cloudy mana of a C-Class Knight; rather, his mana was dense and defined. The 11th and 12th Battalions, as expert knights, were bordering on B-Class.\u201cYou can raise your blade at me and maybe scratch me a little when you\u2019re a B-Class Knight\u2014but you\u2019re C-Class! Just look at the difference between us!\u201d\u201cWell, there have been people who said the same thing as you, but\u2026\u201d Joshua\u2019s smile grew as he drew Lugia from its subspace, to Kases\u2019s astonishment. \u201c...I don\u2019t care about your Class.\u201dHe began pumping mana into his spear. Bright white currents of electricity poured into the ground, scattering in all directions and driving the knights into a hasty retreat. Soon, the electricity began to accumulate into a single point\u2014into Lugia, to be precise.\u201cUnbelievable\u2026\u201d Kases gaped at Joshua as the white light flooded from the boy\u2019s body into Lugia.Before, the mana was like oil meeting water. Now, the blue mana from Joshua\u2019s hand mixed freely with a color they couldn\u2019t comprehend, adorning Lugia in bright splendor. It was not inferior to Kases\u2019s mana in any way\u2014in fact, it even seemed to be clearer and better defined.It was obvious to everyone that Joshua had the aura of a B-Class Knight.\u201cWho said I\u2019m a C-Class?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was small, yet mesmerizing.\u201cThis is the elixir that restores long-lost memories, right?\u201d\u201cThat is true, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cSide effects? Expected results?\u201d\u201cThis is for reviving old memories, not creating new ones. The impact will be excellent, and we are expecting no side effects.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Wizard Evergrant.\u201d The Emperor returned Evergrant\u2019s smile with satisfaction. \u201cHow about mass-producing the Elixir, now that an antidote has been created?\u201dEvergrant\u2019s face became worried.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible, Your Majesty. Unlike the antidote, I didn\u2019t create the Elixir itself.\u201d\u201cHmm. I can see you\u2019re hesitant.\u201d Marcus eyed the unhappy wizard. \u201cI heard the Magic Tower offered to make you the next Magician of Thunder. Is it true?\u201dEvergrant\u2019s eyes widened, though his expression remained unchanged.\u201cSeeing your shock, I\u2019d like to remind you that I have eyes and ears all over the continent.\u201d The Emperor shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty capable magician yourself; it\u2019s not a question of whether or not you can fit in the Seven. I\u2019m just a little sad, you see, that the great Avalon will lose a great talent like you. There are not many people like you nowadays.\u201d\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d Evergrant appeared to ponder something, then opened his mouth with renewed determination. \u201cI already rejected their proposal. I will never leave Your Majesty\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Marcus smiled, but it was a strange smile. \u201cIs it because of the Fourth Prince, after all?\u201d\u201cThe\u2014\u201d Evergrant stopped.Emperor Marcus could read his subjects like an open book, to say nothing of events happening in the Imperial Palace.\u201cI see the Fourth Prince as a snob with no regard for anything. So how was he able to fish up a talent like you?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Evergrant said, \u201cI serve Your Majesty, the Sun of the Empire, exclusively.\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201d Marcus chuckled. \u201cAnd the Fourth Prince will have to keep his eyes open; if he meets my expectations, who knows? Maybe he will be the next one on the throne.\u201dThe Emperor tapped his palm against his throne.\u201cIt was nice to see you, but I won\u2019t beat around the bush anymore. The Elixir is complete\u2014do you need something in return? I\u2019ll hear it. If you want a title, I\u2019ll give it to you. Women? I can give you one that will hang onto your every word. I can give it to you, because it is within my power.\u201dIt was impossible to contradict that statement, arrogant as it was. This was none other than the Emperor of Avalon, Marcus von Britten.\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Evergrant responded, eyes bright. \u201cI would like your approval to access the Royal Archives.\u201d\u201cThe Archives?\u201d Marcus tilted his head curiously. \u201cWhat an odd request. Isn\u2019t there something else you want? That\u2019s a bit\u2026 I mean, I can give you anything you want.\u201d\u201cNo, Your Majesty. I\u2019m looking for something, and I know that I can find it in the Royal Archives.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for this for a long time now?\u201d It seemed like Evergrant had piqued Emperor Marcus\u2019s interest.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m looking for a book.\u201d\u201cA book?\u201d Marcus leaned back into his throne, examining Evergrant with a smoldering curiosity. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that what you\u2019re looking for will be hard to find. It\u2019s like something an old-fashioned wizard would want.\u201dThe Emperor waved his hand.\u201cJacken.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d A man clad entirely in black appeared.\u201cAs soon as the work is finished, open the Archives.\u201d\u201cI hear and obey.\u201d\u201cVery good. Then\u2014\u201d Emperor Marcus pulled himself from his seat, casting a meaningful gaze towards the door. \u201cTell Babel von Agnus to proceed to the court.\u201dI can\u2019t believe what I just saw. I don\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0to believe it, even if it\u2019s true.Kases has begun his career as a mercenary\u2014a rare occurrence for an Imperial Knight.The mercenary guild of Igrant divided their ranks by skills and experience, as if imitating the Knights. Missions like running an errand, subjugating monsters, and participating in minor territorial disputes were 1-2 stars.For the guild to acknowledge someone as a true mercenary, a \u201cgold card,\u201d they needed to complete at least a hundred 3-4 star quests. The chances of that happening were astronomical\u2014of a million mercenaries, only a hundred would receive the gold card.Kases had managed this feat before he reached the age of forty\u2014one of Kases\u2019s 4-star quests was taking the head of a B-Class Knight. He went on to become a mercenary knight in Aradia, the land of opportunity, and eventually even an Imperial Knight. Still, the long, slow journey had not sated his ambition.Up until this moment, he\u2019d done as he wished. He knew he could move up to the top battalions\u2014if he had the skills. The knights of the 11th and 12th Battalions struggled to climb to higher battalions, and were scorned for it.The young man in front of him was just stating the truth that Kases was trying to avoid. What\u2019s more, the boy had already mastered Aura at the tender age of ten.\u201cDon\u2019t try to mock me!\u201d Kases scoffed at the blue-haired boy. \u201cThat can\u2019t be Aura! C-Class is a stretch of the imagination already, but now you\u2019re a B-Class? You\u2019re just a brat covering up your little tricks with the Duke\u2019s power!\u201cYou should be ashamed!\u201d Kases screamed, red-faced. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand how your childish behavior is harming the Duke\u2019s reputation?\u201dJoshua just laughed.\u201cAre you smiling!?\u201d Kases\u2019s brow furrowed.\u201cDo the 11th and 12th Battalions fight the Bloody Battle with their tongues?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this a shot instead?\u201d Joshua brandished Lugia at the dumbfounded knight. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201cGoddammit!\u201d Kases didn\u2019t wait for someone to tell them to start\u2014he leapt off the ground and sprinted towards Joshua, channeling his rage into the lethal edge of his blade. It looked like he wanted to split Joshua\u2019s strangely-shaped artifact in two, but that was dangerous.\u201cKases! Wait!\u201d Ranger shouted at Kases, but it was too late. He could only watch in horror.\u00a0This is bad, he\u2019ll be injured at this rate!Joshua watched Kases rush at him with dark eyes, clenching his hand around Lugia.If he tries to cut it in half, it could backfire. He should definitely observe his attack patterns first.Kases approached, bringing his four-foot blade down at Lugia.If that\u2019s how you want it, then so be it.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s eyes sparkled as he stretched out Lugia to meet Kases\u2019s longsword.Kases\u2019s eyes widened, but his reason had returned too late. Joshua was moving too fast for Kases to comprehend, much less avoid the confrontation with his Aura.Their weapons collided with a deafening roar, Joshua\u2019s spear meeting the tip of Kases\u2019s sword head-on. Ranger and some of the other knights turned their heads away and squeezed their eyes shut, imagining Joshua puking blood and passing out.But\u2014\u201cUgh.\u201dThe knights didn\u2019t know if they should be surprised or worried.\u201cThis is fucking crazy,\u201d Ranger spat.The Agnus boy wasn\u2019t the one spitting blood. It was his colleague, Kases, Imperial Knight of the 12th Battalion.\u201cI\u2026 eugh\u2026 lost.\u201d Kases gazed up at Joshua with trembling eyes.Joshua slowly raised Lugia.\u201cW-wait!\u201d Ranger fearfully called out.\u201cStop!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man\u2019s thick mustache was nowhere to be found, but his face was exactly as Joshua remembered.\u201cWhy is the captain here?\u201d\u201cI heard he was on vacation\u2026\u201dThe large but polite man carefully approached Joshua, ignoring the 12th Battalion\u2019s loud mumblings. His tall frame loomed over the ten year old boy, casting him in shadow.\u201cI have heard the rumors. Are you Young Master Joshua von Agnus?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Viper Baison, right?\u201d Joshua peered intently up at him, wearing a sweet smile.\u201cOh?\u201d Surprise flashed across his face. \u201cYou seem to know me well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201dViper examined Joshua with a puzzled expression.He hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0Joshua\u2019s grin widened as he recalled old times.Viper was more loyal and obedient than anyone else, even when Joshua was roughing it as a mercenary. He stood at the front lines, bravely breaking through anything in their path. He was a trustworthy leader, well-regarded by both his superiors and subordinates.He was one of the reasons why Joshua chose to join the Imperial Knights.I thought we would meet soon, but not this soon.Viper spoke up just before Joshua could.\u201cHow well do you know Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle, Young Master?\u201d\u201c...Your comrades asked me the same thing.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d The way Joshua described Viper as the knights\u2019 \u201ccomrade\u201d rather than their \u201ccaptain\u201d caught Viper\u2019s attention. \u201cDo you know the rules of Berche\u2019s Bloody Battle?\u201d\u201cRules?\u201d Joshua tilted his head.\u201cOne, or even two, captains at the least should be present; we don\u2019t want anyone selling off their rank for money.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re here to see the results?\u201d Joshua laughed. \u201cBut from what I know, only the 10th Battalion and higher have captains. It\u2019s said that the 11th and 12th Battalions\u2019 captains are just puppets for formality\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cI was just explaining the rules,\u201d Viper calmly explained. \u201cThe restrictions still apply, even if the captains in question have no power.\u201d\u201cSir\u2026 Viper.\u201d\u201cKases?\u201dKases heaved himself up, covered in blood.His defeat was witnessed by a few hundred knights, whether they were following the rules or not. His fate was set in stone, and seeing Viper try to defend him only made his heart sink.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m alright, Commander.\u201d He propped himself up on his unsteady knees and gingerly wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. \u201cI always say that if we want to run away from the painful truth, we have to keep our pride intact at the very least.\u201d\u201cKases\u2026 I know you\u2019re trying to keep your pride, but it never mattered. You said you wanted your kids to see you as a knight, rather than a scary mercenary, right?\u201dKases sagged.\u201cAnd what happens to your daughter? Your status gets her treated by a high priest in the capital\u2019s temple, but it isn\u2019t going to cure her. If you go back to being a mercenary, the priest will demand donations you can\u2019t afford to pay. What good is your pride when you have a family to feed?\u201dKases bit his lip, choking down his tears.\u201cYoung Master,\u201d Viper said to Joshua, \u201cI apologize on their behalf for showing you something so unsightly.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Joshua shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m actually grateful that nothing has changed.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your subordinates, isn\u2019t there still a way?\u201d\u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d\u201cI know the rules are different when a captain or a unit commander is the one losing the fight. Am I right?\u201d\u201cCommander, this is ridiculous!\u201d\u201cI would rather resign than make you fight the Young Master!\u201d\u201cWhat is this trash\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you understand what you\u2019re saying, Young Master?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Joshua knew more about the fight than anyone else\u2014he\u2019d seen it first hand.Each battalion had two seats\u2014two leaders. When the captain was absent, the unit commander assumed command. On the off chance that one of them was defeated\u2026I\u2019d stay an Imperial Knight, but I would be stripped of my rank. What\u2019s more, I\u2019d never be able to climb the ranks again.In other words, losing would mean he\u2019d be trapped in the low ranks forever. He\u2019d be doomed to watch his subordinates be promoted over him, and then watch his juniors do the same. Taking orders from someone you used to outrank was like a slap to the face, to the point where it was preferable to resign of your own will.\u201cIt\u2019s the same, even if I resign. It was foolish of me to think that there was another way around this.\u201d\u201cCommander!\u201d\u201cThis never should have happened\u2014\u201d\u201cStop that.\u201d Viper looked over the silent knights with hard eyes. \u201cThis role was only created because it gave us a better chance at survival.\u201d\u201cCaptain\u2026\u201d\u201cThat aside, I consider you all my comrades\u2014and my friends.\u201d Viper looked around at the knights. Each one met his eyes and bowed. \u201cYoung Master, you should be recognized by at least three knights of the battalion for you to replace me. In order to do that\u2014\u201d\u201cI just need to be smarter than them.\u201d Joshua smiled faintly.\u201cAre you sure? I mean, I'm embarrassed to say it, but the level of skill between you and the knights is significant. We were formally trained and ordained as the Empire\u2019s strongest knights.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Joshua took a step back to look at the knights. \u201cThen what\u2019s this trampled pride I smell in the air.\u201d He hefted his spear and grinned at Viper.\u201cFive years,\u201d he told the bewildered knight. \u201cI\u2019ll turn the 11th and 12th Battalions into the greatest knights that Avalon has ever seen.\u201dI can do it. I can imitate it.Then, Joshua pumped unfathomable amounts of mana into Lugia. It hummed with barely-contained power.The knights could hear thunder. They didn\u2019t know where it came from, but it was certain that it had something to do with this\u2026 spear. It felt like the same energy as when Joshua summoned his Aura, but what happened next was completely unexpected.The crackling energy formed a third blade between Lugia\u2019s original two. Its sheer power threatened to tear the fabric of the world in two, forcing some of the newer knights to shut their eyes and cover their ears.Viper stared at the spear, dumbfounded.\u201cAura\u2026 Blade.\u201d\u201cI greet the dazzling Sun of Avalon, Your Majesty the Emperor.\u201d\u201cAh, Babel. It\u2019s been a long time\u2014I recall the last time I saw you was when you graduated from the Academy.\u201d Emperor Marcus smiled at the boy\u2014no, he\u2019d grown quite a bit. It would not be a stretch to call him a man already.\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d Babel bowed once again.\u201cNow, now. Please, raise your head.\u201d\u201cAs you will.\u201dBabel\u2019s prim and proper manners made the Emperor\u2019s eyes crinkle.\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve progressed even more. C-Class Intermediate, right? That\u2019s a great achievement! You make Avalon proud.\u201d\u201cAll by His Majesty\u2019s grace.\u201d Babel bent his head once more.\u201cOh, please. It was all because of your overflowing talent. You\u2019re gifted beyond measure.\u201d Emperor Marcus laughed heartily. \u201cWhat age are you now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fifteen this year.\u201d\u201cEven your father wasn\u2019t at that level at your age, and you\u2019re not far from being B-Class. Keep up the great work! I\u2019m expecting great results soon.\u201dA boy\u2019s face briefly flashed through Babel\u2019s head. Why?Because it doesn\u2019t feel like this praise belongs to me?\u201cYour Majesty, there is still much to be done.\u201d He smiled cruelly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m still far from what you expect.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Marcus said, leaning in closer with a wide smile. \u201cIn comparison to that boy, it\u2019s not nearly enough. Your brother, Joshua von Agnus\u2014but worry not! I shall bestow a gift to you.\u201dEmperor Marcus snapped his fingers with a boisterous laugh. Jaken appeared and presented Babel with a vial of clear liquid.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 what is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift, for the Empire\u2019s greatest treasure. You may be able to obtain a large amount of mana through this, thus accelerating your plans.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe effects of such elixirs varied a little, but most boasted sky-high prices.\u201cSuch a priceless present, Your Majesty\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u00a0order\u00a0you to drink it.\u201dBabel mumbled something incomprehensible.\u201cTake it as soon as possible. If your father is busy, I can help you manage the effects of the elixir.\u201d\u201cHow can I impose on Your Majesty like this\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m making that an order.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I shall obey.\u201d Babel accepted the elixir gracefully, oblivious to his monarch\u2019s ulterior motives. He let the delightful aroma tickle his nose for a moment, then downed the elixir.Emperor Marcus let his satisfaction show for a brief moment.Soon, another man emerged and slowly approached the slack, dull-eyed young man.\u201cIt was a success, Your Majesty.\u201d The man bowed.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, Evergrant.\u201d Emperor Marcus rose from his throne and examined Babel.\u201cWe met pretty frequently when you were a student at the Academy,\u201d he said to the half-conscious boy. \u201cYou made a pledge to me at that time. You must succeed Aden von Agnus, which means you must not lose your position to your half brother. Do you understand?\u201dEmperor Marcus smiled eerily, finding a glimmer of gold in Babel\u2019s vacant eyes.\u201cI\u2019m placing my trust in you, Babel von Britten.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201dFrightening revelations in the Imperial Palace aside, five years passed in the blink of an eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
