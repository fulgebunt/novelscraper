No, Psychke.\u201dIn the 18th\u00a0year of maintaining the castle, which had been struggling to do so, somehow fell sharply.It was something I was so afraid of, but I didn\u2019t feel anything. Was it because I am facing something more terrifying than that?Psychke, who was on her knees with her head bowed, raised her face slowly.Then, she faced a face cold as ice, that\u00a0 was also looking down on her.\u201cI know your fault.\u201dOnce her Foster Father, but now a figure who determines her death.He was saying something.Although, no words came into Psychke\u2019s white ears.It was a strange work.\u201cI won\u2019t talk long. You should be thankful that this is the end of it, considering the past.\u201dUntil now? Was there something like that?Accidents that had been standing still, went down slowly. She slowly lowered her eyes and looked down at what was in front of her.Light green poison.Extreme poison that can end one\u2019s life even after swallowing one drop of it.\u201cFather, this is too much. Please show mercy to me.\u201dThe woman next to her Foster father whined cutely. Psychke looked up at her blankly.Her silver hair that curls down to her waist. Blue eyes that seemed to contain the cool autumn sky.If there\u2019s anything different from her, it\u2019s the milder and na\u00efve impression.Other than that, they have the same age and gender. But, just exactly why is she standing in such a different position?What was the difference?\u201cLillian, she is overreacting. Didn\u2019t you \u00a0almost died?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct! That girl deserves to die!\u201dThe older brother and younger brother, who were next to Lillian, teased her. \u00a0At that very moment, something appeared on Psychke\u2019s expressionless face.It was a scornful smile.She lived behind their shadows for over a decade. Even though she was just a substitute for a lost daughter.Thank you for accepting me even though I was referred as a fake princess.With a heart to help the family, even with her low capability.I tried and tried every single day.Then I foolishly thought that I would be recognized. I shamelessly thought that I would be able to stand beside them one day.However\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201dShe clenched her teeth and recited the truth that no one wanted to listen.\u201cI swear to heaven, I really don\u2019t know anything.\u201cShe expressed her resentment even though no one would listen to her.\u201cAsk the maids. I\u2019m really\u2014\u201d\u201cBut this is still!\u201dWhack! She got hit on the head by something that flew.She thought she was just getting dizzy suddenly, but something hot flowed down her temple. From the noise, which broke something, it must be a crystal vase that was thrown over her.The soft scent of freesia lingered on the tip of her nose, was unsuitable for the current situation.\u201cThe investigation was already over, you idiot! If anyone sees that, they will catch you living\u2014\u201d\u201cStop it, Lenox.\u201cHer brother Yzhar silent Lenox, who was very excited, by glaring at him.\u201cAs you said, it\u2019s already over. It\u2019s your loss to be excited.\u201dYzhar\u2019s black eyes stared at Psychke. There was no emotion in her eyes. It was as if she was looking to an object, not to a person.\u201cThis came out of your room. And your exclusive maid testified.\u201dYzhar lifted the necklace with a large emerald stuck in the middle.Psychke could speak with confidence the words,I swear to heaven that, it was my first time seeing that in my life.Her exclusive maid is not working for her, the fake princess, but for the real princess, Lillian.But\u2014\u201cYou were going to gift this necklace to Lillian, which would sting her neck right after putting it on, right?\u201d\u201cOh my god, Psychke\u2026! I thought we could be good sisters.\u201dLillian whined as if she was scared, being held in the arms of her father. Psychke looked at her insensitively. Then, she burst into laughter.Maybe it was because she had put everything down while she was in confined.She couldn\u2019t think of anything.Yet, it was like pouring white paint into her head, and nothing came to her mind.Her mind was too calm.No tears came out from her eyes either.It might be better to end it like this. Psychke picked up the poison with trembling hands. She felt nothing as if she was holding the air.Finally, she raised her eyes and looked up at the deceitful people who thought they were saviors at this moment.Duke Silkisia, her Foster father.Yzhar, her older foster brother.Her younger foster brother, Lenox.Lastly, the real princess, Lillian, who got lost more than a decade ago, and the woman she served as a mere substitute.\u201c\u2026!\u201dUnlike others who shut their mouths and didn\u2019t take their eyes off from her. When Lillian made eye contact with her, she trembled and dug into the Duke\u2019s arms.It may be just an illusion, but in Psychke\u2019s eyes, Lillian\u2019s mouth seemed to be drawing a light line.Psychke realized that no one would mourn her death.There was no place here for her from the beginning.It was terribly a late realization. Nothing different would do about looking back on irreversible things.Psychke continued to dwell on the past. She regretted it, over and over, those times she was swayed by them.And that was because it was the last thing she could do while breathing.She didn\u2019t look away from those who looked down at her. She lowered her warm lips in the cold bottle and whispered quietly.\u201cIf I were given a next life. I would never ever live like this.\u201dEven if it was a useless will. Even if it fades away, just like a bubble.So that it can be engraved deep into her bones. Even her soul gets wet. Or even she would be reincarnated. So that she won\u2019t repeat the same mistake.She drank the poison earnestly, repeating the same useless wish.The meaningless scent of freesia poked her nose.***The cold liquid goes down my esophagus. I drank and drank again, ignoring my hair, which was flying as the wind blew.\u2026 But why, there\u2019s no pain?I thought there were purple flames everywhere I look, but all my senses disappeared right after I was affirming it. At the same time, my vision turned dark.I thought it was dark because I died. I realized that I was closing my eyes to a strange sound around me.Bang, bang, bang\u2013Listening to the sound, Psychke carefully opened her eyes.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe family that should have looking down on her coldly, were nowhere to be found.Instead, a group of freesias dancing in the sky was seen over the opened window under the warm sunlight.It was Psychke\u2019s own room.Tap, tap, tap\u2013The unpleasant sound sank back in my ear.I turned my head toward the sound. Melissa, an exclusive maid who frowned and shook off the dust from her clothes, was seen.I dropped her gaze down to the thing around her. Cold steak, lumped soup, and a cold teapot caught my eyes.Psychke looked at her hands.There was a teacup in my hand, not a medicine bottle.\u2018What is this?\u2019Tak, tak, tak- The sound of dust shaking was constantly heard.It was a familiar scenery.She knew better than anyone else what would this scene turn out.Melissa would dust off after bringing a cold meal to her every morning.Whether she was sleeping or not. Whether or not dust settles on her food and she eats it.Whether she doesn\u2019t want to eat dust at all, whether it\u2019s winter or summer, with the windows wide open.Psychke tied her brown hair together and twisted it, and glanced at the head in front of her.Then, the moment Melissa turned around the corner and showed her side face, she muttered in a dreamlike voice.\u201cMelissa.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUnlike the master\u2019s voice, an unpleasant voice could be heard from Melissa, just like in her past life.However, Psychke decided to check one more time.\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see what I am doing? I am obviously cleaning!\u201dIt looks more like putting the dust off, than cleaning.Psychke closed her mouth instead of saying what she saw.Then she took a knife nonchalantly that she couldn\u2019t even rip through the steak, pulling up mana.It was because she couldn\u2019t tell whether this was reality or fantasy.\u2018\u2026!\u2018The path of mana which the wizards blocked miserably, went open. As if it was never blocked.Oh, is this place in a fantasy?\u201cSigh. It\u2019s really dirty. How do you take care of your room?\u201dMelissa spoke loudly.\u201c\u2026\u2026 \u201dShe got used to it every time she heard it.But this time, she was a little annoyed.To the person who drove her to death, she wondered if she should listen to such words even if it was fantasy after deathPsychke didn\u2019t respond as usual.In the meantime, she carried Mana to the knife she was holding as usual.Right next to the maid\u2019s ear.\u201cOh my god!\u201dA loud scream seemed to tear her eardrums.Is this reality, and not fantasy?Psychke slightly frowned between her eyebrows. Then as soon as she met Melissa\u2019s astonished face, she opened it gently as if something had happened.\u201cA, are you crazy?\u201d\u201cI was going to help you clean, but I\u2019m sorry. What kind of trash was there?\u201cPsychke replied subtly as if whispering. At the end of the knife, which was stuck in the wall and trembled, a spider was stuck and dead.\u201cCra, crazy!\u201dThe maid couldn\u2019t bear to swear. She grabbed her red swollen ear that had been rubbed against the knife and ran away.Psychke was taking a leisure look at the appearance, and turned to the window where the fragrant fragrance of freesia blew.The fragrance of freesia piercing the tip of her nose is horribly clear.Is this real?Or is it a fantasy you witness just before you die?If this reality, it\u2019s like hell, and if this is fantasy, it\u2019s more terrible than anything else.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And that, before Lenox enter meetings, Psychke was actually the one who gets the information first before him.\u201cAs expected, I guess this wasn\u2019t heaven.\u201dPsychke, who was looking through her bad rumors on the gossip paper, muttered casually.There were still blood-stained wounds on her palm.It was the trace, where she cut with a knife, distinguishing whether this was fantasy or reality.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a fantasy.\u201dIf this was fantasy, the pain on her hand, couldn\u2019t be more clear.Then what\u2019s left is\u2026\u201cGod makes mistakes, too.\u201dThere was a legend in the empire that had been passed down since its founding.If you receive the blessing of Vicente, the god of fortune, you will get one more chance when you die without living up to your name.Legend is just a legend in the end.Although, it has never happened in history.Regardless of one\u2019s rank, they would go to the temple, praying for blessings after having a child.I think the legend has come true.Psychke concluded that in a situation where she couldn\u2019t get an answer even after thinking for a long time.\u201cBlessing to fake things.\u201dShe was surprised by the words that inadvertently popped out of nowhere and soon smiled.\u2018Silkisia is the only one who accepts something like you.\u2019On the day she received Silkisia\u2019s surname, those were her foster father\u2019s words.As proof of his words, the world was not easy for her.Everywhere she went, she was always regarded as a fake one. People pointed out that she should know her limits, judging over her. Even though her only sin, was being adopted.I was afraid. I was also shunned by everyone, but more importantly, I was afraid even Silkisia would turn a blind eye to me.She tried hard. She tried not to be abandoned, she tried to be recognized to be useful.With her determination, she surprisingly surpassed the real Silkisia\u2019s, Yzhar and Lenox.\u2018You shouldn\u2019t be superior to them no matter what.\u2019She thought her foster father would like it. For some reason, her foster father disapproved of her. It was also said that the name of the great Silkisia was scratched, due to her.She hid her talent and acted foolishly as she was taught.People misunderstood her, and cursed her without knowing the truth.It was all right.Then gradually, when it became difficult to hide my talent, I realized a fact.If I hadn\u2019t be superior to them, shouldn\u2019t I make them my superiors?So she became their stepping stone. She secretly filled their shortcomings, one by one.\u2018I see you\u2019re doing well.\u2019The first day I was praised by my father. I saw hope.I thought I would be able to be recognized and loved by Silkisia if she keep doing that.It was like that originally, but then\u2026\u2018The princess is back!\u2019Fakes\u2026 is still fake in the end.Fake could not be real.Lillian, who was loved no matter how much she don\u2019t try, was receiving affection just by breathing.However, I didn\u2019t think of leaving Silkisia while witnessing it.\u2018If hadn\u2019t for Silkisia, do you think there would be any place who would accept anyone like you?\u2019There couldn\u2019t have been.Painful days went day by day, same thing happened every day. Still, I endured it, thinking that this was the only place I could live and be confident.That\u2019s how I lived for half a year.And died in vain.\u201cI was stupid.\u201dI realized it only after I reached an irreversible point. That I was thoroughly used as a tool.It was an expensive lesson, learned from solitary rooms and death, where no light came in.However, she doesn\u2019t know why her father abandoned her. Even though she kept going in circle, she couldn\u2019t figure out an answer.Just because the real thing is back doesn\u2019t mean that my value of use is over.\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019Getting out of her thoughts, she caressed the date written on the gossip paper.(TN: Gossip paper/column; A gossip column is a part of a newspaper or magazine where the activities and private lives of famous people are discussed.)It was half a year ago before the day of her death.\u2018Why does it have to be today?\u2019Today was an unforgettable day in Psychke\u2019s life.Because\u2014Bang!\u201cLady!\u201dAs it has been, Melissa opened the door without knocking and without asking for permission.As if she had been running hard, her original face was covered with sweat, her breathing was rough, and one ear was wrapped in a bandage.I know what Melissa will say. Nevertheless, Psychke waited for her to open her mouth.\u201cDid you hear that?\u201dIt would not be a misunderstanding to say that the answer to that question, was the end of Psychke in the past.After catching her breath, Melissa raised one corner of her mouth at an angle.\u201cMiss Lilian is back!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve already experienced this once.I don\u2019t know what the hell to say again this time.Psychke closed her eyes slowly and opened them with an expressionless face.***The lobby of the Mansion, which Melissa guided her to, became a sea of tears.\u201cHuhu, Older Sister, Older sister\u2026\u201dLenox was sobbing while hugging Lillian, who returned. The employees surrounding them were not much different.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard.\u201d\u201cThe sky helped you!\u201d\u201cNo, Vicente helped me.\u201dWhenever the employees shouted with a loud voice, the official who came with Lillian corrected it. His coronal robe was embroidered with Freesia, the symbol of the God of Destiny.Although it was known that he was long ago dead.Duke Silkisia could not give up the hope that his daughter would return alive. So, after entrusting hair and blood to the temple, he asked for an examination if a woman claiming to be Lillian, appeared.\u201cThey\u2019re perfectly the same. This must be Princess Lillian Silkisia.\u201cWhen the new building made an unshakable voice, the cries around it grew even louder.Psychke quietly stared at the scene from behind the pillar a little further away.Melissa pouted her mouth as if laughing at her, and then joined them.\u201cLady! Do you remember me? I am Melissa!\u201dLillian was only three years old when she went missing. There\u2019s nothing I can do but remember, so that\u2019s probably a futile attempt to show how close she was to the real princess.She couldn\u2019t hear what Lillian answered from the side where she was.Instead, she heard another employee next to Melissa making a loud noise.\u201cWhat about you, Psychke?\u201d\u201cExcuse me.\u201dAlong Melissa\u2019s fingers, the eyes of the people standing inside the lobby landed to one place.Only one person, the priest, looked sadly, but all had a cold light.A presence like a unfamiliar object stuck in a place that should not be interrupted.The cold heartbreaking gazes were nothing to her now.Really.Psychke took one step at a time.Likewise, to the front of Lillian who was looking at her.The employees surrounding Lillian made way, like a splitting sea.They looked curious about how Psychke would come out.Psychke stared at the woman who had become thin and dirty through various hardships.Even the coveted silver hair that comes up to her waist. All the blue lake-like eyes remained the same in the past.It was just quiet everywhere.\u201cLilian.\u201dAt that stillness, Psychke created a wave inside the lobby.Lillian, who had a scared look on her face, flinched and grabbed her chest tightly. Tears were in her big eyes, as if she was about to cry.\u201cWhat else are you going to do?\u201dLenox, who was next to Lillian, became fierce.As it has always been the case, Psychke spoke softly before she poured abusive language and swear words.\u201cYou came back safely. Welcome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..?\u201dThe employees whispered as if the calm appearance was unexpected. Ignoring them, she continued to speak.\u201cIt may be uncomfortable, but please wait a few days. I\u2019ll vacate the princess\u2019 room soon. It would be nice to think about how to decorate it in the meantime.\u201cLillian\u2019s eyes opened wide as if she was surprised to gently hand over the position of a princess to her.Lenox, who was fiercely staring at Psychke until then, talked.\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s to re-develop Princess\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cEven if you act like this, you would never get my pity\u2014\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dLenox crumpled his face at the change of his sister, who was trembling with contemplation as if saying, \u2018I\u2019m kicked out.\u2019\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf my father or brother were here, they would have attached an exclusive maid. Until the two of them return, I hope Melissa will be there for you at the meantime. You can do that, right?\u201dIt was a fake princess\u2019 order that she always ignored. Melissa could not easily reject it, perhaps because the real princess was woven.Psychke turned her back on her last nod.\u201cHey, hey!\u201dAngry at being ignored, Lenox shouted.Psychke didn\u2019t answer.Didn\u2019t you want to do something good to your sister you haven\u2019t seen in a long time?Even though she disappeared from everyone\u2019s sight around the corner of the hallway, Lenox, who had to bring anything in his hand, remained quiet.\u201c \u2026Ha.\u201dI couldn\u2019t breathe.Only then did Psychke exhale, which she had hidden deep in her heart.***\u201cPsychke.\u201dIt was that night that her older brother, Yzhar, knocked on her door.Psychke, who was organizing her luggage alone to empty the room, blinked indifferently. Then she opened her mouth so small that he couldn\u2019t hear it only after the third knock.\u201cCome on in.\u201dDid you come as soon as you left the palace?Yzhar in his outdoor clothes, came in.Insensitive black eyes swept everywhere. Then, soon after, it turned into a surprising light.\u201cSo it was true. Have you grown up?\u201dIf he was her real brother, he would have worried about his younger sister who would have been heartbroken. It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s saying such disrespectful things.Ordinary people would have been hurt a lot. Psychke answered back, packing things without agitation.\u201cI\u2019m just giving it back to my master.\u201d\u201cUse the room on the second floor. I\u2019ll tell my father.\u201dThe second floor room refers to a guest room.\u201cOkay.\u201dYzhar wriggled his eyebrows, perhaps because he felt strange about the emotionless answer, seemingly she was treating customers. However, Psychke, who was turning her back, did not see it.No matter where she moved to, nothing had changed. I won\u2019t make the same mistake this time.I will leave this family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She complained about an unknown headache, back when she was still young, which is why Yzhar sends her the tea.\u2018It was terrible.\u2019Her words should be special, but it was only forced.I didn\u2019t want to drink it. The taste was horrible, and after drinking all of it, I started developing strong dizziness. In simpler words, my headache hadn\u2019t change at all.But honestly, I seized every chance I had and tried to talk to him about it, yet it was his contempt for me that always comes back. He\u2019ll always be like, \u2018Is that how you\u2019ll going to say to me after I took care of you the best I could?\u2019So I held it in and drank it silently.But there was no need for me to do that anymore.\u201cYou said that there are people living in the desert?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it too! I mean nomads in the west. I heard that you set up a bonfire every night and fall asleep while reciting poems. Is that true?\u201dBecause I sent Melissa, who brought tea every morning, to Lillian.\u201cHmm, but it purely depends on the tribe. That was the tribe where I was.\u201dMelissa was heard making a fuss at Lillian\u2019s gentle answer.\u201cWow, so romantic!\u201d\u201cIt was more than a decade ago, but sometimes, I still remember it. The smell of burning firewood, the sound of playing the rut, and the sound of tribesmen reciting poems\u2026. I would have stayed there if I hadn\u2019t been fooled like an idiot person.\u201dLillian was depressed, saying she had done all kinds of hardships while following the leader of the tribe.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, I would have been tied to the mountain and lived as a maid.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cDear, princess! That person\u2019s name is Widnix Evo\u2026\u201dPsychke sighed at the voices of Lillian and the maids from the window.The garden is spacious, and there were many left spaces for her to enjoy her tea time.\u2018Why do you had to be right down there?\u2019I listened to their voices with one ear and glanced at the clock.There was not much time left before the man came out of the living room.\u2018I must hurry up.\u2019Psychke stood in front of the mirror after touching her waist-length hair.Her beautiful blue like cat eyes, yet expressionless and a little depressed, blinked.Unlike the past, when she insisted on wearing colorful dresses to stand out, somehow, she was wearing a modest clothes today.My taste was originally this blunt. It was also because there was no maid to dress her up.They said that I can pull this rope connecting other maids, other than Melissa. But I didn\u2019t want to put so much effort into it.I brushed off the crumpled hem. She always wear accessories when meeting him, but now is different.Without wearing any accessories such as earrings or necklaces, she left the room.\u201cYoung Lord Silkisia, if you come out like this, we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d\u201cHow can I go against the will of the His Majesty?\u201dPsychke headed to the living room.I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re done talking.A man with dark hair with his cold face and Yzhar, with a very relaxed expression were coming out of the hallway.\u201cIkaxia knows how dangerous northern horses are. But, you know. In order for us to move, we need His Majesty\u2019s permis\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you think you is enough to persuade His Majesty?\u201d\u201cWe have no authority to do so.\u201dYzahr is able to do it, but he doesn\u2019t want to do so, although it was really possible.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can walk you home because I have another schedule.\u201dThe short silver hair that came down to the back of his neck quickly disappeared.\u201c\u2026 That punk. Why does he care about people\u2019s garbage?\u201dThe man who was left alone, spat and cursed.Psychke, who was hiding behind the pillar and watched as the situation unfolds, came out and approached the man, pretending not to be surprised.\u201cDuke.\u201dBlack hair that seemed to melt the night sky was waving finely. The tip of the cape over the shoulder drew a semicircle.Duke Verndia Lestir, one of the three major dukes in the empire and the owner of the purple flame, turned his body around.Annoyed look filled his purples eyes, but when he saw his fianc\u00e9e getting closer, it instantly faded away.He softly smiled. A fake smile that could be considered as treating his fianc\u00e9e lovingly if a stranger witnessed it.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. What brings you here?\u201dVerndia reached out one hand as if to greet her with a kiss on the back of her hand.Instead of giving her hand, Psychke lifted her head and faced his purple eyes, which contained no affection at all.Suddenly, I remembered the scene I encountered at the verge of dying.The purple flame that wrapped around her body like a snake and blazed brilliantly.However, I erased it from my head, thinking that it must had been a fantasy or a mistake from my memory.\u201cYou\u2019re having a hard time because of the Northern monsters.\u201d\u201cThe Princess don\u2019t need to care about that, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI can solve it for you.\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression hardened. He straightened his slightly bent back and took out his hand.\u201cIf you want to go somewhere else like before, that\u2019s all it matters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201cI gave a negative answer, but my fianc\u00e9\u2019s face did not calmed down.It was what she expected. Verndia around this time, was not happy again with her.Was it because of an unusual situation, where an almighty Duke and a mere fake princess were engaged?He was always keeping an invisible distance from her.At the beginning of the engagement, I didn\u2019t even know about that fact, and even tried to approach him because I fell in love with the kindness that he showed to me that was different from my family. However, I found out later that he didn\u2019t accept me more than a certain level.So I tried to attract his attention, terrified that my marriage might be broken or that I would be kicked out of my family for that crime.As a result, he came to hate me.Before he return, he was in a very bad state due to some kind of incident.Verndia now still had antipathy against me.And some kind of incident was a kind of mistake. Psychke had no intention of doing it again. It shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Princess, but I\u2019m a little tired today. I hope we can talk about it next time.\u201c\u201cTurk, Ildia, ah.\u201dThe man who was about to leave, turning his back on what she had memorized like a spell, stopped.\u201cThey are the names of the higher-level monsters that appeared in the north.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know where you heard it, but you must have traded with a fairly competent informant.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how to fight back. Without relatively much damage in return.\u201dVerndia eventually turned back and saw Psychke. Later, when he exhaled coldly, his bangs covered his forehead floated upward.\u201cAll right. What about today?\u201d\u201cI want you to promise me one thing, before I tell you.\u201c\u201cWhat promise?\u201d\u201cIf you succeed in eliminating the monsters, I don\u2019t think our engagement should be maintained anymore.\u201dThere was only one reason why their unbecoming engagement could be established.\u2018It was the high-level monsters that were pouring out in a bizarre amount.\u2019As the main culprit of Verndia\u2019s current troubles, it was also the weakness of the duke captured by the emperor.(TN: If anyone is baffled, this just simply implies that the monsters are troubling Verndia and his weakness which the emperor caught. (did I just re-translate it?))Around a year ago.Dungeons in Duke Lestir began to be filled with high-level monsters.In the beginning, the case was how did they block it, but the next problem was\u2026It\u2019s faster for a holy temple to fall down, than the monsters. Moreover, since many manpower was called into the battle, the land that had no one to take care of, was ruined.Therefore, Verndia asked the imperial soldiers to join the Order.In order to imprison him, the Emperor persuaded him to be engaged with Silkisia, who represented the imperial faction, and one of the people of the crown Prince.Naturally, the crown prince and his subordinate opposed it. At that point, the Crown Prince\u2019s mother, Empress, collapsed from illness.The Northern case naturally fell away from the Crown Prince\u2019s interest, and Verndia, who was in a hurry, decided to get engaged.\u201cAh, you\u2019re asking me to stay engaged.\u201dVerndia smiled as if he knew she would say that.If the monster tormenting him disappeared, it would not be strange if their engagement was broken. No, rather it should be destroyed.Not only are the factions different politically. She was not Lillian, a real princess, and there was no reason to maintain his engagement with a fake princess who did not know when she would be abandoned.Although their marriage cannot be broken right away due to the attention of others, it will take some time.Thus Verndia\u2019s conjecture was reasonable.\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dHowever, Psychke denied the speculation with a single nod.\u201cI want to break up my marriage with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs soon as the monsters disappears, break our marriage.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you serious?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect that at all.Verndia responded a beat late.Psychke lifted her left hand and tapped the gold ring on her ring finger.\u201cTo be exact, I want to take this out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That is.\u201dWhat she pointed to was their engagement ring, Jarister heirloom.When they are close, their rings resonates and shines, and they can share their location and feelings with each other from afar.In order to take off the ring, he had to go to Vicente\u2019s temple and declare the breakdown of his engagement under the agreement of them.\u201cIf you want me to take it out, I will take it out now. Because the Duke hates me.\u201d\u201cNo, I have no intention of taking it out right now.\u201d\u201cI know. You don\u2019t want His Majesty to have his eyes on you.\u201dDid he hate being read his mind?Verndia\u2019s eyes narrowed. Psychke continued expressionless, lowering hee raised hand.\u201cBut if the monsters is gone, you don\u2019t have to be wary of His Majesty, so wouldn\u2019t it be okay to break the engagement afterwards?\u201d\u201cWhat would princess gain when she does that?\u201dVerndia was wondering about her incomprehensible words.\u201cAny trade is established when both parties benefit. But looking at the princess\u2019s proposal alone, it doesn\u2019t feel like a deal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beneficial for me to take this ring off.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201c\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t understand. If you are anxious, you can write a contract.\u201cWithout this ring, I would have left Silkisia as soon as I returned.She was like Verndia\u2019s leash, which is now rumored to be difficult to handle.So if she disappears like this, they would have looked for me with their eyes lit in Silkisia and the imperial family. With the tracking function on the ring.\u2018Just before she died, the family and the imperial family forced the marriage to be broken, but it seemed that the Duke refused.\u2019Why did he do that?It was an unexpected change that happened overnight. Psychke had no idea.\u2018By all means, why?\u2019Now that I decided to break up my marriage, it was a good thing anyway.So immersed in her own thoughts,\u201c\u2026 All right.\u201dVerndia, who was looking down from afar, looked up.\u201cI will write a contract. I will send you a message soon after.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThere is not much time left before leaving the Duke.Psychke calmly smiled for the first time since her return.His purple eyes that contained his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s face turned slender.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His visit that was not expected at all.Verndia\u2019s lips parted without looking away from the window.\u201cIsolet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the benefit of a princess if she breaks off her engagement?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dIndeed, it was a random question.However, Isolet embarrassment did not last long. He quickly shook his head.If so, these would be the benefit of Psychke Silkisia from the breakup.\u2026\u2026 Is there a thing like that?\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, Duke. May I ask why are you suddenly asking that?\u201c\u201cThe princess has demanded me to break out marriage.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dIsolet\u2019s mouth opened wide at the shocking news. He knew how Psychke was obsessed with Verndia.He poked his ears to know if he had possibly heard it wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s not only that. She said that she would willingly help me in dealing with the monsters. To be precise, she said, \u2018I\u2019ll help you, so in return, let\u2019s break off our engagement right after.\u2019\u201d\u201cDo you dislike the Princess that much?\u201dIsolet was guessing that he had bothered Verndia so much, that Psychke finally tried to escape after taking off the crane.Verndia briefly glared at him and turned his eyes outward.\u201cYou know that I am not a kind of person to ask for a breakup for that reason, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cNo, it is, but Prince Yzhar didn\u2019t say anything on that matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u2018Please keep it a secret that I made this offer. Especially to the people of my family. \u2018It was only then that I remembered she asked me to keep our upcoming breakup a secret.He was stabbed on the inside, but he didn\u2019t show it on the outside. Anyway, Isolet wasn\u2019t stupid enough to go anywhere and reveal it without thinking.\u201c\u2026 It seems like the princess personally suggested it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIsolet breathed in vain as if he was exhausted. Then he snapped his fingers, as if something came to his mind.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of that rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean rumors?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean why, Duke? Rumors that the real Princess Lillian has returned.\u201cVerndia, who realized what Isolet was saying, wrinkled his face.The aide, who had no regard for the fierce master\u2019s momentum, continued.\u201cI guessed you have pondered that it would be better to make an agreement with the Duke and finish it neatly than to be dragged out by the Emperor and divorced in front of everyone.\u201dAfter the real princess appeared.Among the imperial nobles, Verndia and Psychke\u2019s engagement had emerged as hot topic.Now that the real princess is back, he should break his current engagement with Psychke and engage with the real Princess, Lillian.After the forced engagement, they never helped each other, but they argued that the Duke should be engaged to Silkisia again, and somehow there were also strong opinions that the current engagement should be maintained.\u201cLook who\u2019s a complete moron here.\u201dVerndia, who wore a vicious gaze, opened and clenched his fists threateningly.Isolet just bowed his head as one of the residents of Lestir.Originally, Verndia had no good personality. Even before the appearance of the monsters, his nickname was the Mad Dog of the North.\u201cIt\u2019s all annoying. Should I just flip this wagon over?\u201c\u201cResidents, please think about the Residents, Duke!\u201dIsolet abruptly uttered his idea and don\u2019t want Verndia to show his real colors.Verndia, who had roughened the grip from his cravat, sharpened his teeth. Violet flames began to flash from his fingertips.\u201cDid you bring my medicine?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Here you go!\u201dIsolet, who shook off the flame trying to move his cravat, hurriedly took a bunch of medicine out of Isolet\u2019s pocket.Verndia chewed one of them and leaned his back against the back of the carriage.He was still frowning. The flame from his fingertips calmed down as if the medicinal effect was spreading to his body.\u201cPlease refrain from it. I don\u2019t want you to be burn to death.\u201dAs the medicine bag was recovered, Isolet made a tearful face.Verndia, who slowly closed his eyes, said as if growling.\u201cThings doesn\u2019t go my way.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t live like this for the rest of your life\u2026 Oh, do you think Princess Lillian isn\u2019t capable? Because it is a blessing passed down from generation to generation through the blood of Silkisia\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. If so, Silkisia could not have been this quiet.\u201dEven if Lillian was the \u2018capable\u2019 one, he had no intention of getting engaged with her.Taking medicine for the rest of his life would be much better than living on with a leash called Silkisia.Was it consideration for him to calm down? Isolet did not talk to him anymore.As he said, Verndia slowly breathed in and out to avoid burning the wagon.Then, amidst the silence in the wagon, his calm demeanor has resigned once again, and her words came into his mind.\u2018I want to break up my marriage with you.\u2019Nervousness, anxiety.Those feelings were always mixed within him, surfacing from inside.But today\u2026\u2018I want to break up my marriage with you.\u2019Her eyes that contained him were empty. He felt empty from them.Was it because of the belief that he would have no choice but to accept her offer?No, it\u2019s not. To say so, those eyes\u2026.\u2018Thank you.\u2019Only once. There was a time when her empty eyes shone.It was time for him to write a contract to break up the marriage.It was like a dying man in the battlefield smiling at a priest.He can\u2019t say for sure if he\u2019ll be able to survive, but he\u2019s just happy that he got a chance\u2026That look kept haunting me. I shook my head to shake it off, but I couldn\u2019t shake it off.\u2018Tsk, so annoying.\u2019It was something I had seen so much on the battlefield. But in a place that was not even a battlefield, I was seriously annoyed to see her doing so.\u2018Break off engagement.\u2019Verndia, who had been recalling her actions, frowned.I couldn\u2019t believe that it was alright for her to take off her ring.He was convinced that there would be something else that would benefit the princess, which he had not yet grasped.And he had a personality to dig thoroughly into what was behind her words.\u201cAttach the crow, Isolet.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who will you be talking to?\u201d\u201cPrincess Psychke.\u201d\u201cAre you serious, Duke?\u201dIsolet was terrified when he said that he was going to use the crows which he used to dig out the weaknesses of his enemies and will going to attach them to the princess who was known to be incompetent.But Verndia had calmed down his backlash with a single gesture.***Psychke, who had broke up with Verndia, slowly went around the garden. It was to organize thoughts on how to deal with Duke Lestir\u2019s castles.In the past, she had been researching about monsters in her own way to alleviate the worries of her fianc\u00e9e.Although she died even before she had the chance to hand the information to him.\u2018They live in the north, but they were unusually weak in the cold.\u2018Most of the monsters living in the north were strong whenever it\u2019s cold. Because of this, the northerners were used to use fire or warmth-infused tools when hunting monsters.That was the thing.\u2018The demons that appeared this time are the opposite. Weak to cold, strong to heat. On the contrary, there were things that became stronger when warmed up. The question is why did they appear in the North \u2026 .\u2019Doesn\u2019t it seem like someone caught the monsters in the southern castle and put the protective shield on them and released them in the northern part?There\u2019s something suspicious about it.This part is something that Verndia, the owner of the territory, has to investigate on his own, so she decided not to think deeply.\u2018The outer leather is strong against the cold, so the priority is to pierce the leather on the skin.\u2019He said that it is not easy to even scratch the leather unless the organization is so solid and it is a magic sword.Even though Lestir\u2019s Territory is wealthy, he probably cannot afford to pay everyone with a magic sword, which is the price of one castle. It was impossible to do, even for the emperor.\u2018There was a mineral that could replace a magic sword\u2026.\u2019Just around that time, I couldn\u2019t remember what happened clearly because I was taken to the solitary room due to the necklace poison incident.Psychke stopped walking and tried to recall the name of the ore.\u2018Was that something like month? Month, month\u2026\u2019Boogsh!It was a moment when I was about to remember.Cold water flew in from the side part. Psychke, who quickly became a drowning mouse, blinked.\u201cOh, my. Princess!\u201dMaybe it\u2019s because I was too immersed in my thoughts.Before I knew it, I left the garden and arrived at the laundry.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were there, Princess. I\u2019m sorry. Oh my what should I do?\u201dThe maid who accidentally threw water on me, rushed over and made a fuss. With an expression that doesn\u2019t seem sorry at all.\u201cMari, you should have checked if anyone was passing by before throwing it away.\u201c\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the Princess would pass by in such a shabby place.\u201dThe maids, led by Mari, poured out words that did not know if they were reprimanding, apologizing, or being sarcastic.They all tried to wipe off the water from her clothes, but they kept their mouths open.Whenever I blinked, the droplets formed on my long inner eyebrows and flowed down, making it look like I was crying.Psychke quickly took a step, touching her messed up face with her palm.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dUnlike her wet appearance, what came out from her throat was a dry voice.\u201cHey, I hope I\u2019m not in trouble\u201d.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? She\u2019s a fake whose going to be kicked out soon.\u201d\u201cIf I were her, I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk around because I\u2019d be ashamed of myself.Extreme voices were stinging on her back.Psychke didn\u2019t look back. She didn\u2019t stop, yet continued walking. Until she arrived at her room on the second floor of the mansion.\u201cHaah.\u201dAs soon as she arrived, she fell down leaning against the door. Then she sighed and lifted a handful of hair.Wouldn\u2019t this cursed ability be found out if there was any chance?Strangely, thin ice was stuck on her wet hair.Even though it was a sunny spring day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA few days had passed since then.\u201cAnyway, there is no such thing as education. Just what did His Grace see in her to bring here?\u201dToday and this time, Psychke was hit by water, while walking in the garden.It was the act of a gardener who was watering the flowers. He sprayed it on purpose even though he knew that she was clearly passing by.Since experiencing being splashed by water, I focused on suppressing my ability, so my hair didn\u2019t get ice every now and then.Psychke immediately returned to her room after what occurred. But as soon as I came back, I was told to be careful because I spilled water on the hallway and destroyed the expensive carpets, which was laid outside.\u201cI don\u2019t think the person who brought you here knows that you are an uneducated person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe butler\u2019s face, who unintentionally cursed the housekeeper, turned red. Bang! He closed the door and left.\u201cWho\u2019s not cultured?\u201dPsychke calmly dried her wet hair. I changed my clothes and sat in front of her desk.I looked through the paper which were hidden in the drawer, and wrote about my future plans.Even though I was splashed by water, I felt good at this moment.Because\u2014\u2018It was moonstone.\u2019Finally, the name of the ore which she had problem remembering, came to her mind.A moonstone.It was an item with no much value as it was created by the low-quality magic crystals immersed in the light of the full moon.There were times when it was used as an accessory because the color was softer than any ordinary jewelry.These days, it wasn\u2019t popular among married women at all.\u2018Its strength is weak, but that\u2019s not the reason why I am going to it fight for.\u2019The monsters living in the dungeon were weak against light.However, the mineral that holds its light, the moonstone, was not used as a weapon because of its weak strength. Rather, it was used a magic sword or much better is hire a wizard to do so.\u2018As long as it can hurt them, then there\u2019s no problem.\u2019It has no grand requirement to be able to do it. All you have to do are these three things; grind the moonstone, then put it on a regular sword, and finally swing it on the skins of the monsters.Unlike outer leather, the inner flesh of the monsters was weak against cold. And the Lestir territory where they appeared, belonged to one of the coldest area in the empire.So if you leave it alone with a wound, it would die on its own.Needless to say, if the wizards who were hired by Lestir, used Ice Magic, they would naturally fall faster.\u2018It\u2019s not real, and it\u2019s also a low-quality magic gemstone, so one can easily get it from the Duke of Lestir.\u2019For Verndia, who owns dozens of magic crystal mines, the moonstone isn\u2019t something worthy, in fact it\u2019s just as good as a stone struck in his foot.\u2018That\u2019s how I\u2019ll deal with other things\u2026 but Asum type of monsters is the problem.\u2019A sorcerer-type of monster was known to be intelligent enough to resemble a child.It always appear at the back of the lower rank monsters, although they were known for being able to cast healing magic and increases recovery of a monster.Even if one had wounded the monsters with moonstone, it was obvious that monsters would be able to heal quickly if Asum was present.Therefore, I had to deal with this man first.Or perhaps what he\u2019s doing is not taking his eyes off them, so they can\u2019t use magic.\u2018His weaknesses are obviously women and jewels.\u2019I had a clue on how to deal with it.But. Is that the only way to settle things?Psychke was lost in thought, tapping the margin at the end of the paper beside the pen. The empty paper, then was filled with the black dot pouring down from the pen.It was then. I heard knocks after another.No one has ever knocked on her door except Yzahr, who values the eyes of others, such as their family honor and prestige.He said he would come again back then, and Psychke opened her mouth even before the visitor could reveal himself.\u201cCome on in.\u201dGently, the door was opened.As expected, the person who came inside had shiny silver hair.However, the person who came in did not have black pupils like an obsidian stones.Her eyes were blue like sapphire.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Psychke.\u201dLillian who knocked and walked in her room, shyly spoke. And Lenox together with Melissa, were standing behind her like her escorts.\u2018Lilian?\u2019Psychke would be lying if she won\u2019t say that she wasn\u2019t embarrassed.Before returning, Lillian had never visited me like this, not even once.I didn\u2019t want to get involved in their little tricks, so I avoided them and especially her, as much as I could. But then again, why did she come here?This situation now somehow seemed to overlap with the poison needle necklace incident for some reason.I remembered the Duke, who came in at once, and was staring at me, with his two knights standing behind him. With that, my back shivered and my hair stood up* in fear.(TN: Hair stood up; an exaggeration to imply that someone is seriously afraid of something.)Psychke unknowingly gave strength to her hand which held the pen.\u201cWhat brings you here\u2026?\u201dIt was an unexpected meeting, so there was a rustling sound, unfamiliar with the situation.Twisting her hair with her fingers, Lillian spoke shyly.\u201cI came here because I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\u201cFavor?\u201d\u201cGood people are teaching me education, but they said that it would be better for me to learn from the person in charge of what should I do as a princess\u2026\u201dLillian was around the age of three when she disappeared. Therefore, as soon as she returned home, she was taught regarding etiquette and a mindset a princess must have.Psychke realized what Lillian was talking about. But she asked again in doubt.\u201cThe person in charge?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been occupying my sister\u2019s place, so let her know what she needs to learn.\u201dLenox beats his chest as if frustrated, and muttered rudely.If you see me as a person with feelings, how can I possibly do that?Psychke was speechless. In the meantime, Lillian hummed timidly, hitting both of her index fingers.\u201cI knew that you did it for my reputation, and it\u2019s alright, but I have to do it all alone sooner. Also\u2026 I don\u2019t wish to make mistakes.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything in particular.\u201dShe didn\u2019t said that because she didn\u2019t want to take over, rather it was true.Psychke was only a princess in disguise, but in reality, she was just one of the workers of the Duke.Although other female nobles of their age are eager to go out to society and raise the reputation of the family.Psychke used to be a laughingstock just by participating in meetings.A foolish fake princess whose not recognized by her family, and yet she looks like a parasite who clings to her family\u2026So instead of interacting with others, she locked herself up in the house. She read books and practiced swordsmanship, just to shake off those absurd thoughts.Those were her foolish acts because I want to be recognized. Because I want to be by their side someday.There was no need for Lilian, the real princess, to be desperate about that. Because real and fake are very different from the starting line.\u201cSigh, what would you want from me?\u201dLenox clicked his tongue, perhaps because it was pathetic to say that she had done nothing.He always had no idea that Psychke had secretly leaked information just before he enters the meeting every time.\u201cI knew this would happen. Let\u2019s go, Older Sister. We shouldn\u2019t be fooling ourselves. She doesn\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dHe just wanted them to leave.Lillian hesitated to leave and think if she had more things to say.When she gave her gaze to Psychke, she wrapped her red cheeks and smiled like an in love girl.\u201cYou know, I was wondering, what kind of person is the Duke of Verndia?\u201d\u201c..?\u201d\u201cPeople told me that he is going to be engaged to me soon.\u201dPsychke was once again at loss for words. Lilian cried out softly, feeling embarrassed just by thinking about it.\u201cRumor has it that he\u2019s a very, uh, a little scary, but he\u2019s a very cool guy. What do you think? Is he a really cool person?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dI think you asked the maids regarding that in my previous life. Why are you asking me personally this time?I\u2019m back safely here. But do you think I was pleased to hear that?\u2018I wasn\u2019t that na\u00efve.\u2018Back then, whenever I saw Lillian being loved by everyone in the household, I was so heartbroken that I consciously avoided her.Hence, we only see each other when necessary. There were intense things left in my mind.The expression on her face that looked at me with pity.And a proud expression that sometimes passed by her face.\u2018It seemed like she was bragging about this.\u2018Whatever her intention was to come and see me, I didn\u2019t want to talk to her anymore.Psychke decided to give the answer the other person wanted.That way, she thought she could end the unnecessary and tiring conversation a little faster.\u201cIt is said that an engagement between nobles can take place without seeing each other face to face. Is that true?\u201d\u201cThen, I can do that too?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer correctly?\u201dLenox, who was listening quietly, intervened.Psychke looked back at him indifferently, she then exhaled lightly and corrected her answer.\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t really prefer that\u2026.\u201dPerhaps it was an important thing for her, Lillian touched her lips and fell into trouble of thinking.Then, as if she had thought of something, she looked at Psyche with a bright smile.\u201cCan you invite me the next time you meet the Duke?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dOther times, I would had already said yes.However, their next meeting was supposed to be discussing and writing the contract of their engagement.He was almost exhausted when he found out that she had betrayed the will of Silkisia and had agreed to help him.When Psychke showed hesitation to answer for the first time, who had been responding with her blank face, Lillian mistook it indifferently.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to steal yours, I just want to meet him! As his future fianc\u00e9e!\u201c\u201c\u2026 Can I first ask the duke and tell him about this? Since the Duke\u2019s permission is important too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, I see.\u201dAs if she had never thought of it, Lillian pushed her tongue out with an embarrassed look.Psychke looked at her action with narrowed eyes. Then, with a headache that came suddenly, I grabbed my forehead and stumbled.It was very painful. Her whole body seemed to be trapped in an ice.I almost stumbled on the chair because of the pain I felt. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t get hurt, since Lillian caught me.\u201cPsychke!\u201dSurprised, Lillian screamed. The scream was swallowed up by natural words afterwards.\u201cShe\u2019s doing that because she wants attention. Don\u2019t worry, Older Sister.\u201d\u201cYou said\u2026 attention\u2026?\u201d\u201cHey, that always what happens when she\u2019s bored. If she gets tired of doing that, it\u2019ll just go back to normal, so let\u2019s just go.\u201dLenox trembled at the sight and spilled his words insincerely to Psychke as if he was troubled. As if there was nothing more to see, he led Lillian, who was embarrassed, outside.Melissa, realizing that she didn\u2019t do the work she was supposed to do, brought out the tea, which she does every morning, and made a smirk on her face.But it was just only that.With her expression erased in an instant, she followed Lillian and Lenox.Bang, the door was finally closed.There was no one next to Psychke, who was seriously struggling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI barely endured the cold sweat creeping me all night. And it was already morning.Psychke struggled to open her eyes. There was a cold tea cup and a letter on the desk.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBlue eyes read the contents of the letter. An expressionless face was gently reflected on the brown surface of the tea.After looking at the letter for a long time, she did not drink the tea and abandoned it near a vase on the desk.Although her headache was severe from the teas, I no longer wanted to receive something from this family at no cost. It was still awful.Then she picked up the letter. The royal seal with a golden lion painted against the background of the shield was removed and the inside was examined.On the inside page, it was written that all the nobles of the empire were invited to the second prince\u2019s, the son of the Emperor, coming-of-age ceremony banquet to be held in a few months.\u2018I couldn\u2019t go there before.\u2019That was because a certain someone tore her dress apart the day before the banquet.Psychke was speculating that it might had been done by an employee who kept her eyes on her closely, who couldn\u2019t let go of her even though the real princess appeared.Yzhar who greatly values the prestige and reputation of the family, was not a man who wouldn\u2019t her to be absent by violating the order of the Emperor.Lenox was a human being who would rather break an armor with his arms and legs, rather than do the hassle of tearing off a dress.\u2018Neither did I thought that it was Lillian. If that was the case, then the fake Princess will shine even more than the real one.\u2019Nevertheless, Psychke was not going to attend the banquet again this time.In social circles, there were several people who felt an indescribable joy by staining a princess who was in a high position but was not recognized by her family.It was more reasonable and profitable to do the work she promised to the Duke of Verndia, than to be insulted by those people.But her family didn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dI was about to leave the room in my outdoor clothes when I heard a voice.Psyche ran into Yzhar, who was also ready to go out.Behind him were Lillian and Melissa in the same outfit. Apparently, Melissa seemed to have established herself as Lillian\u2019s exclusive maid.\u201cI have a place to go to.\u201dAs long as she did not harm the prestige of the family, Yzhar would not care what she does at all.They just attached guards in their carriage disguised as escorts to prevent accidents from happening.So I thought that this would be the same as what had occurred before.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear it from the butler?\u201dYzhar, who crumpled his forehead, expressed his displeasure. His black eyes shook with annoyance.Obviously, the butler would have only said what he had to say while I was sleeping. So I answered back calmly.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. The butler told you for sure.\u201d\u201cMay I know what it is about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to match your clothes for the Prince\u2019s banquet.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dWhen I said I would give everything to Lillian, I felt good and wondered if she was trying to match a new dress. I\u2019m not going to go to the banquet, so what\u2019s the point of all the dresses?It will be fine if the tailor will not be in the mansion at the promised time. Thinking so, Psychke casually inquired.\u201cWhat time will the tailor come?\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019re going in person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cTo show Lillian around and to greet people.\u201dWhen she was ordered to walk around in the middle of the day with the real princess, Psychke gave a blank expression on her face.Why does the person who always values the prestige of the family tries to create such a situation? I didn\u2019t understand him.\u201cI originally planned on going only with Lillian, but Lillian asked me to go with you and Lenox. In which you can be thankful.\u201c\u201cYesterday, you seemed to be in so much pain, so I wanted to go with you.\u201d Lillian, who mumbled silently from behind Yzhar, smiled mischievously.Really, I felt like I kept losing my words when I was facing her.Psychke looked at Lillian from afar with her lips slightly opened.Then she licked her dry lips and said to Yzhar, who was waiting for her appreciations.\u201cThank you for your consideration, but I don\u2019t need a new dress. The existing ones are enough.\u201c\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be harmonious with the family, don\u2019t force yourself. But, it\u2019s been a while since the family went out.\u201dAt his not-so sincere words, Psychke realized one thing.Yzhar wanted to show a Duke\u2019s etiquette that harmonizes well in the family even after the real princess returned, rather than the turmoil that will arise when the real princess and the fake princess go around together.At the same time, boasting it that he was one of the Duke\u2019s family that embraces the useless fake princess without abandoning her.I thought I put everything down.I was choked that he saw me as a tool, not a person with character. Psychke muttered in a trembling voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have something urgent to do.\u201d\u201cIs it more important than harmonizing with your family?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYzhar\u2019s face hardened due to the deviation of her words, who was usually obedient.He gave a firm voice as if scolding the child who had done wrong.\u201cPsychke.\u201dHowever, Psyche, who always had to change her words when this happens, was oddly quiet.It was the expression of rejection of changing her words.It has been incredibly annoying to her when she realized how she was treated in this household, but it was not a fake reaction, more than that, or less than that.It was heartbreaking to see my younger Sister rejecting me, who should have acted like what she was doing all the time.Yzhar looked down proudly at Psychke while moving his long fingers.In my mind, I wanted to educate her right now.However, it was not possible because Lillian was waiting behind him and Lenox was waiting on the first floor.Eventually, he decided to take a step back. Just now then.\u201c\u2026 As soon as you\u2019re finished with the urgent thing you need to do, come to Madame Bell\u2019s boutique.\u201dPsychke silently bowed. I didn\u2019t raise her head until the regular footsteps in the hallway subsided.No matter what happens. No matter what\u2019s the cost.I will never follow the words of the people in this house.****Waiting for the carriage of her brothers to move away, she went out of the mansion. As Yzhar didn\u2019t escort her because he was so angry, I became more at ease.She headed straight to the Magic Association.To find out what kind of ice magic can be inserted into the bodies of the monsters.And advice on how to deal with the wizard-type monster, the Asum monster.Unfortunately, I could not meet the wizard.It was because the Ice Barrier Wizard was absent to answer her eager question.Once every half a year, wizards of each attribute gather from all over the world to have a meeting, which is this week.Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t help it.After making a reservation, Psychke turned and headed for the jewelry store. I really wanted to see the moonstone, which I had only seen in books.However, Psychke failed to achieve her goal again this time. As soon as she arrived at the jewelry store, several noble ladies who appeared from somewhere, surrounded her.\u201cOh, my. Who is this? You\u2019re the Princess, right?\u201dYellow eyes that seemed to be made by melting pumpkins with her gray hair which comes down to her chest.Of all things, it was Marquis Miss Hilvia Esland, who bothered her the most in the society circle.Hilvia glowed her eyes like a fox who found her prey.Then she covered her mouth with a fan and bent her eyes. The ladies with her also laughed and added words.\u201cAll of your family were in the boutique. Why are you here alone?\u201d\u201cHey, you can\u2019t say that. The princess might not had known.\u201c\u201cOr maybe you came out to find your family?\u201dPsychke casually skimmed through the women laughing at her.Then she slightly sighed so that no one could bother her anymore and turned around blatantly. It was an action to get out of place.\u201cAre you ignoring us?\u201dAs expected, Hilvia, who was offended, blocked her way when there was no response coming from her.Psychke looked closely at her, who has the same similar height as her. Her blue eyes, which were always filled with sadness, anxiety, and sorrow, was only expressionless.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHa, then why didn\u2019t you say anything\u2026 Huh?\u201cI said I\u2019ll ignore you.\u201dI left the frozen Hilvia alone and moved my feet. Other ladies except Hilvia hurriedly blocked Psychke again.\u201cPrincess, I didn\u2019t view you that way. Aren\u2019t you being too rude?\u201d\u201cHow can you say that you\u2019re ignoring her personally?\u201dI don\u2019t care.\u201cGet out of my way.\u201dPsychke took a step. It was a waste of her time facing them.However, she had no choice but to stop walking by the evil cry of Hilvia when she had decided to walk away.\u201cYou\u2019re rude at me because you\u2019re sad at your engagement with Duke of Verndia that was going to break off?\u201dWhat do you mean broken marriage? Did he spread the promise he made with me to others?Her shaking gaze reached Hilvia. When embarrassment came to her mind on her expressionless face, Hilvia\u2019s pumpkin eyes flashed horribly.\u201cOh my, I guess you didn\u2019t know yet. Unfortunately, there are rumors that the Duke will soon welcome his new fianc\u00e9e. Well, it\u2019s amazing that you two were engaged even though you knew that you\u2019re just a fake.\u201cPsychke\u2019s expression changed strangely when he said \u2018new fiancee\u2019. An odd expression that she can\u2019t clearly display.One thing was certain that it was not the anger, frustration, or grief that Hilvia wanted. Rather, it was more of a positive expression.Without noticing this, Marquis Miss raised the corners of her mouth violently. She approached Psychke and tapped her chest with the end of her fan.\u201cDo you understand now? Pretending to be the princess is now finished. As long as Princess Lillian and Duke of Verndia get engaged, even your brazen face\u2014\u201d\u201cWho said they\u2019d be engaged to whom?\u201dSuddenly, a man\u2019s voice was heard from behind Psychke. It was a voice that both women knew well- a confrontation voice.They looked up at the direction from which the sound came from.\u201cYou seemed to be telling very interesting stories. I\u2019d love to them hear from you.\u201dThere was Verndia, smiling beautifully, and Isolet, who helplessly called out \u2018Lord, Lord!\u2019 with his paled face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Translated by LionessEdited by Lioness~ Chapter 7 ~\u201cDu, Duke!\u201dHilvia was frustrated when she saw Verndia approaching them, and stuttered. It was well known in the Capital that Duke Verndia, was like a crazy dog in the north, who despise backtalk the most.She made a hasty excuse.\u201cWe, well I\u2019m not saying it because it-it\u2019s a bad rumor\u2026 but\u2026 I was just saying that the Duke is soon to be engaged with Princess Lillian.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s real?\u201dAn indifferent Miss intervened between them. Even after knowing what was Verndia\u2019s personality was, her curiosity still suppressed fear.\u201cWhy do you ask that? Isn\u2019t that obvious?\u201dThe Miss, who was next to Hilvia, asked her and poked her on her shoulder.\u201c\u2026 Are you so curious about that?\u201dVerndia\u2019s smile grew dangerously big.It looked the same as a beast in a battle. No one can dent that even if he was scary, his handsomeness was on another level that it shone brightly.The young ladies, who blushed with their own emotions, lowered their eyes.As a result, only Psychke saw the assistant\u2019s face whitened like flour.The Duke\u2019s gaze finally reached Psychke.She dryly replied like a wind of sand blowing into the insensitive wall of courtesy, without averting her eyes.\u201cYes, I\u2019m curious.\u201dShe could feel the utter surprise from her boldness, staring at the two, holding their breaths. But she looked at him without caring about the ladies.Half a year later, after she died in her last life while drinking the poison given to her every morning, Verndia didn\u2019t get engaged with Lillian.Although she had never seen the two together in person, she was told that whenever he met Lillian, everyone who saw him was so shy about it.Nevertheless, I was curious because I there might be an unexpected thing that would happen if he change his decision.If Verndia was engaged to Lillian, she does not have to bother finding a way to deal with the northern monsters.She can leave her family right away. His sharp eyes and her empty eyes were intertwined in the air.Verndia looked at her with an inexplicable face that she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.Then, at some point, he smiled.\u201cThat would be in no way possible.\u201dAfter saying something negative,\u201cYou are my only fianc\u00e9e, and not Princess Lillian.\u201dLike real lovers, he affectionately put some strands of her silver hair behind her ears, that came down to the side of her face.Long fingers with calluses crossed my ears. Verndia\u2019s body temperature was higher than that of others, so she felt like hot as if she had touched a fire.\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cThen was that a lie?\u201dWords that were close to screaming burst out. However, her eyebrows drooped slightly downward.I was disappointed. Whenever he was with her, he always treats her like his real lover.Therefore, his behavior or tone was something not new to her. Even so, it was just painful that her expectation of breaking their engagement early, would be delayed.Verndia\u2019s expression when she saw her became subtle.\u201cPrincess, shall we move now then?\u201dThere were too many eyes to talk about the breakup here.When be think about the things that these ladies dared to say while I was absent, I felt an immaculate anger soaring above.He had a greater desire to talk to Psychke, who was acting strangely than dealing with them.If they had been a normal couple, he would have used the pretext of harassing his fianc\u00e9e, to relieve the stress he had accumulated over the years.\u201cYes, as let\u2019s go \u201c\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dVerndia didn\u2019t realize her behavior was strange, and Psychke\u2019s shoulders\u2026He led her while hugging her shoulders.The aide breathed a sigh of relief and followed him unexpectedly.\u201cI envy her\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. Talk about being lucky.\u201dThe ladies that were left behind looked at the purity of the Duke with their jealous eyes.Only Hilvia shook the fan she held and weighed down her lips.***They headed to the seat nearby a window, in a famous tea house. I quietly followed him, wondering if he wanted to show others how he was acting lovingly to me.As soon as Verndia sat down, he leaned toward her fianc\u00e9e opposite his seat. Then, he lowered his voice so that others could not hear it.\u201cDo you still want to break up our marriage?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs expected. I didn\u2019t see that expression wrong.\u2018When I told her not to do that, she then did it.\u2019Wouldn\u2019t it feel like, the cat who was clingy to him, suddenly disappeared?I didn\u2019t have a good feeling for Psychke, but that didn\u2019t mean he was sick of her.Verndia felt strange.He, along with the crown prince, was the best groom in the empire.He has extremely handsome face, endless wealth, and strong power. Nothing was missing, he have them all.That was why receiving this cold treatment from her, was odd.Verndia, who had his arms crossed, also crossed his long legs gracefully. He frowned gently.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to break up our marriage?\u201d\u201cIs taking off the ring more important than maintaining engagement?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVerndia recalled the effect of their ring when he firmly said it was not worth considering.\u2018Tracking location, sharing emotions. Was there anything else?\u2018There wasn\u2019t.No matter how much he thought about it, there was none.And those two functions were agreements that Psychke was willing to bear from the start.\u2018What kind of engagement ring was that, that you even out such features?\u2019I heard that it was made by the first Duke of Lestir, who lost his loved one in vain. What is the reason for passing the title down to the next generation?Verndia has always been dissatisfied.What was comforting was that unlike location tracking without restrictions, emotion sharing only applies when it is strong enough to capture the whole body.\u2018Duke, I\u2019ll do my best\u2026 Even if it\u2019s shared, please don\u2019t pretend to know. I beg you.\u2019\u2018Let\u2019s do that.\u2019He has been leading a lonely family since childhood. He was used to controlling his boiling emotions.But Psychke\u2019s emotions would flow in from time to time.Sadness, fear.That was all.That was all the emotions shared by her during the long engagement period.If it doesn\u2019t bother him at all, it would be a lie.When Verndia shut up, Psychke opened her mouth this time.\u201cAren\u2019t you engaged to Lillian?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe air around Psychke has subsided noticeably.Her complexion was so dark that he thought she had misrepresented that I had decided to engage Lilian.\u201c\u2026 I see. We will cooperate as much as we can to deal with the northern castles.\u201dPsychke, who refined his shaken expression once, lowered her gaze. The shadow of his rich and long eyelashes cast under the eyes.\u201cWhen should I write the contract I told you yesterday?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDuke?\u201dVerndia, who frowned, heard her respond.\u201cWrite it now.\u201dHe was displeased with this situation.But he didn\u2019t know why it was unpleasant.The breakup with Psychke was what he wanted. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or bluffing, but she even said she would help him deal with the northern monsters.Everything was going in my favor. But why do I feel so bad?I was glad to find Psychke and the ladies immediately after taking the medicine. Otherwise, flames would have been popping from the fingertips out of my displeasure in this situation.Verndia beckoned backwards. Isolet, who was restless while spying on him, commanded a piece of paper and a quill, not knowing where it had disappeared.Psychke looked at the tip of the pen moving gracefully as he wrote.Because of the distance between tables, I did not worry that others might peek at the contract.\u201cSign here.\u201dAfter signing the clause, Verndia offered the contract.Psychke\u2019s eyes upon it, went from top to bottom.The contents of the contract were simple.1. Psychke Silkisia helps to deal with the superior monsters in the Northern Lestir. In return, as soon as the monsters disappear, the engagement with Verndia Lestir is quashed.2. Without Psyche Silkisia\u2019s help, or even if it is insignificant, Verndia Lestir and Psychke Silkisia will break the engagement as soon as the northern monsters disappear.3. This contract cannot be reversed without mutual agreement.According to the provisions, the engagement could be broken as soon as the monsters disappears, regardless of whether there was help or not.It wasn\u2019t bad.Psychke signed where Verndia pointed without saying much.What was so displeasing that he was mad?Verndia, who had his brows wrinkled, looked down at her neat and rounded sign.Then he raised his eyes a little and opened his mouth.\u201cHow long have you been holding a sword?\u201dShe was slow to respond to questions she had never heard before.Psychke stopped for a while after signing, and then looked up at him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI asked how long it\u2019s been since you held a sword.\u201dPsychke rolled her eyes to where Verndia was looking.She took a little time, and then responded quietly.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t exactly know how long it has been, but more than a decade.\u201dHe thought she only grew up beautifully.Verndia stared at her with unfamiliar eyes, to be exact, at her hand with calluses and blisters.Looking at the condition, it seemed that she held a sword yesterday.\u2018You\u2019re using a sword?\u2019Contrary to rumors that she was stupid, she was wary of many things, but he didn\u2019t expect that she was using a sword.A considerable shock knocked on the prosecutor\u2019s heart.\u2018\u2026. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019His unfamiliar yet vivid purple gaze to Psychke, was burdensome.As a lady, rough hands are not worth it, and it has annoyed my family to the extent that it is engraved in my mind, so I hid my hands with gloves until now.Now that I decided to let go of all that. I proudly revealed it because I wondered what it would be like to hide it.When I faced the reaction of others, there was a small reaction in my calm mind.She left the pen and lowered her hand to the table.\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dWhen what he was watching disappeared, Verndia, who came to his senses, an took the contract.He filled out another identical one and handed it over to Psychke. And he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her small hands until she finished signing.\u201cDuke.\u201dPsychke, who signed the completed contract, quietly called him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m quite busy.\u201dHe was annoyed to keep looking at her hands. Now that I have achieved my goal, I came to think that I could leave my seat.\u201c\u2026\u201dVerndia did not answer her. He watched her from afar as she was busy organizing her clothes.Up until now, I still thought that she, who told me to write about our contract, was just something so that I could give her attention. Despite of being smart, I doubt if she have any knowledge of the monsters, when she grew up so well; like a princess.He thought that she would bother him if he dare to reject her offer, and even if it was just a lie, he had nothing to lose anyway, so he decided to follow her words in a way worth for him.But from the moment I saw her scarred hand, which implied signs of holding a sword\u2026\u2018Wasn\u2019t it a lie?\u2019The thought that her words of using a sword might be true, lifted his head unconsciously.\u201cDuke?\u201dHer dry voice disturbed his thoughts.\u201cSure.\u201dHe agreed on what she said, bowing to take a serious look of the signed document on the table.Standing behind him, Isolet, his aide, stepped aside to make path for the lord to leave.It was then.\u201cPrincess, Duke Verndia!\u201dWith the sound of, \u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201d.The sound of footsteps has come closer to them.Verndia, who was getting up, looked at\u00a0 where the voice was coming from with a faltering look. Psychke halted pulling out her chair when she heard such yell.The owner of the roar was Lillian. She was dressed in a new boutique, gorgeous outfit.Yzhar and Lenox, who seemed unpleased of the thought of walking behind her, still quietly followed Lillian, who was running with her reddened face.\u201cAh, how unfortunate tsk.\u201dVerndia was terrified of meeting the real Princess and swear, whom he hated to see.Lillian, who did not hear him, raised her skirt slightly and greeted him gracefully. Afterwards, she took the seat next to him and sat down.(TN: OH come on! Stahpp it!)\u201c\u2026\u201dVerndia hated it to the core. In the meantime, Lillian complained to Psychke, meant for the Duke.\u201cYou\u2019re bad! You said you had something urgent to do. But it was actually a secret meeting with the Duke! Next time you go, take me too!\u201d(TN: I don\u2019t know why I got tired of Lillian even though it was just eight chapters\u2026)She said that it was urgent, but Lillian thought that it was a cover up just to see Verndia secretly.But even before Psychke could point out,Lillian, who leaned toward Verndia, made a cute voice.\u201cNice to meet you, Duke.\u201dA storm has come to them.So distracted, Psychke looked at the other side in a dazed mood.Lillian was smart. Psychke wasn\u2019t acting like a she had no manners, but Lillian was different.Not only was she a friendly person. She also know how to use people\u2019s sympathy to her, the real Princess, who had lived as a commoner for more than a decade, and her na\u00efve image always caught people\u2019s heart easily.\u201cI am Lillian. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dWhen she folded her eyes beautifully, men who were staring at her, felt that they were struck by cupid.At the moment, Psychke forgot that Verndia actually hated Lillian in the past.(TN: *wheezing)Any cold man couldn\u2019t help but to fall for her figure.That was what she thought.\u201cGet out of my way\u2026 Don\u2019t block the road.\u201cHowever, the thought of falling for her because Lillian was the dream of any men, fell instantly.He endured swearing to the Princess in front of him. However, he couldn\u2019t hide his distorted face when he saw her acting cute that didn\u2019t work on him even for a bit.Verndia left without any hesitation and\u00a0 sign of talking to her any longer. Frustrated, Lillian had no time to hold onto him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIsolet, who was left alone, bowed his head to Lillian instead. It was always him to clean up after Verndia\u2019s mess.But Lillian, who suddenly popped up, did nothing well.After leaving only a short apology, Isolet also left them, following the Duke.In an instant, a chilly silence came to the people who were left.\u201cA, am I\u2026 hated by him..?\u201dIt was Lillian who broke the silence. And tears began to tear up in her rounded eyes.\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry.\u201dLenox, who took Verndia\u2019s place, soothed his sister. Then he stared at Psychke and muttered fiercely.\u201cI thought his eyes were broken, but you\u2019re just a wench. What\u2019s so good about him that you like him?\u201dLenox was mistaken that Verndia was in love with Psyche.That was because, Verndia cared a lot for Psychke when they were in public.But Yzhar thought differently.The moment it turned out that Psychke, who appears to be on a leash on the outside, was nothing to him.It was very obvious that he\u2019d tie someone who will be worth to him, so Verndia was just doing it for the sake of gains he\u2019d get.Instead of sympathizing with Lenox\u2019s words, he spoke to Psychke next to him.\u201cDid you run out to beg for love?\u201dYzhar has witnessed so much between their relationship. It was only Psychke who does something in the name of maintaining their engagement.She disapproved at his question that could tarnish Silkisia\u2019s reputation, but in the past she did it for the foolish thought of changing Verndia\u2019s heart. Therefore, she closed her eyes wordlessly.I did that, but it was like I was chasing him like an immature person, throwing away the family\u2019s image.Since the Duke of Silkisia was away to visit the southern territory, the real power of the current duke was with his eldest son, Yzhar.Therefore, rejecting his words was like against the will of Silkisia.Yzhar didn\u2019t mean to let this matter go.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you, Psyche Silkisia.\u201dLike a black stone, his contempt for her was visible.His words were shocking that her heart would sink if it had been said before she returned in the past.Psychke waited for his next words without any agitation.\u201cYou are forbidden to use the surname of Silkisia for a week. In the meantime, you cannot receive the same treatment as a princess, nor can a maid attend you. Do you have any objections?\u201dIt has no difference. From Psychke Silkisia, to Psychke only. Rather, she felt nothing\u2026 even if a person will die in front of her.It would had been difficult if she received to be punished like a bodyguard. It was fortunate for her, and she shook her head.Her nonchalance seemed to offend Yzhar greatly.\u201c\u2026. You must not know how to reflect.\u201dIf it was Psychke in the past, she would had been bowing her head before Yzhar, afraid that she would be abandoned.She always had to be in the shadow of Silkisia. She, in other ways, had no rights to stand in their way.\u201cIn the meantime, you are also prohibited to appear in the Hall.\u201d(TN: I don\u2019t know how to explain \u2018\uc5f0\ubb34\uc7a5\u2019 in a better way, but it\u2019s an enclosed building, so from the context, I think it\u2019s good to say that it\u2019s a Hall.)\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThere was a crack in her expressionless face.Feeling strange satisfaction, Yzhar crossed his arms and leaned against the back of the chair.\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have to see her face for a week? Phew. I feel relieved.\u201dLenox was an annoying and cheeky person. Psychke didn\u2019t even pretend to not hear him.\u201cWhy is that?\u201dHer confrontation was cold, as if Yzhar would freeze if he\u2019d act wrongly.With a beast-like smile that succeeded in hunting, Yzhar responded leisurely.\u201cOnly those who have Silkisia\u2019s last name can use the Hall.\u201d\u201cPromoted soldiers doesn\u2019t have Silkisia\u2019s last name though.\u201d\u201cThey deserve it. Can you say you\u2019re better than them?\u201c\u201cYes.\u201dYzhar\u2019s eyebrows wriggled at her unwavering answer.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI told them I was better than them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dIt was a ridiculous claim.Instead of Yzhar who found her words funny while massaging his forehead, Lenox acted recklessly and pushed Psychke aggressively.\u201cHave you gone crazy?\u201d\u201cWhat, am I worse than them then?\u201d\u201cHey, have you really gone insane? Did you hit your head somewhere?\u201dLenox raised his finger near his temple and spun it around.But Psychke never gave a glance to it. She breathed out a long breath again in her unshakable eyes.Things were going weird.He knew what the surname meant to Psychke.So he thought Psychke was going to bow down in front of him, apologizing what she did. As what she have done so far.\u2018Is it starting again?\u2019If threats wouldn\u2019t work to her, then conciliation would do the work for him.He was obliged to trample on Psychke\u2019s self-esteem, but to prevent her from leaving the dukedom, exhausted from neglect and persecution.It was his father\u2019s order to him.Yzhar\u2019s unraveled his older brother\u2019s disguise for the sake of his younger brother.Then he brought up his words like a mirage that Psychke might like, but was actually empty.\u201cYeah. As you said, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve worse than them. Even if it is not a private soldier, but the spirituality of a precious family, can it be compared to the princess of Silkisia?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 \u201c\u201cOne, they are those who will one day lead a family. And you will be a supporting role for them. Fundamentally, as the roles are different, the qualifications are also different.\u201cPsychke didn\u2019t listen. It was something she had already heard until her ears were worn out.Distinguishing between what you should do as a lady, and what you shouldn\u2019t do.Don\u2019t stain your hand by holding a sword.Studying politics while checking all the history of other aristocrats, getting acquainted of other people, especially to young ladies.That\u2019s what you should do as a lady and a princess of the Silkisia family. Then you can be recognized.As a real princess.As a member of Silkisia.\u2018\u2026Lie.\u2019No matter what I do, they won\u2019t acknowledge me and those accomplishments I\u2019ve done.They\u2019re going to use me thoroughly and discard me after.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to live like that.\u201dI cut off the long-sagging persuasion of him.I felt the gaze of two astonished people, man and a woman on the opposite side, but I didn\u2019t care.She spoke while looking only at the black eyes of the stiffened man.\u201cNo matter how I live, that\u2019s my choice. It\u2019s not a matter for you to decide.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201dThe man, who had been keeping a heavy silence, rubbed his lips as if he was about to hit her.\u201cWhen my father is not around, my will is the will of Silkisia. Are you saying that you won\u2019t follow my orders?\u201d\u201cHave I ever been a Silkisia? I\u2019m certain as a brother, you know the answer. How I\u2019m treated inside and outside the mansion. It\u2019s my brother who knew that and condoned it.\u201d\u201cHey! Are you really crazy?\u201dLenox, who jumped up, shouted at her.In one hand, there was an empty teacup left by Verndia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was already too late to stop this.The eyes of the people around them, twinkled upon hearing that Silkisia\u2019s real princess returned, and it created a fuss in the family.Recognizing them, Yzhar whispered as if chewing on what he wanted to say next.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cBut, brother!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t sit down right away, you\u2019ll be locked in you room for a week.\u201dFor a wild animal running around even with the order to stop, is best to be punished.Lenox sat down, grinding his teeth, glaring at Psychke.Yzhar glared at his younger brother, signaling him to stop being arrogant, and observed the surrounding with his sullen mood.People who met Yzhar\u2019s glare, instantly turned their heads away. But of course, if they can\u2019t witness what will happen between the siblings, they can just listen to them.They should not be worried about them, as Silkisia is like hyenas, otherwise their heads will be sent flying.Yzhar leaned toward Psychke. He also lowered his voice so that others could not hear it, fearing of damaging Silkisia\u2019s image.\u201cLet\u2019s go back first and talk about the rest.\u201d\u201cNo, I hope you finish what you want to say here, right now.\u201dShe particularly doesn\u2019t want to waste her time on something useless. Psychke voiced her reply in a cold manner, looking at the man who ignored her for his entire life, and woke her back to reality.\u201cAs per your description, I am not deserving to use the Hall. In that way, I will prove it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..?\u201dYzhar\u2019s face was slightly distorted.\u201cI will compete with the soldiers who were designated by my beloved brother. If I proved that I am better than them, then I am eligible to use the Hall however I like.\u201d\u201cPsychke!\u201dYzhar who unconsciously raised his voice, shut up at once when he realized that they weren\u2019t in the Silkisia mansion.Not missing anything from what she said, Psychke had nailed on defeating Yzhar.\u201cI\u2019m just following what you said.\u201dIt was said that she has problems thus she have no rights to use the Hall. And so was it wrong to use it with her hands?It would had been okay if she heard him spatting lawful reason for banning her to go to the Hall in the first place.Unable to reverse what he had already said, he chewed the tender flesh in his mouth.Then, what he only felt were the nearby aristocrats interesting gazes. He accepted it with shame in his heart.***\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dIt was after a few hours after breaking up with Psyche.Verndia, who was taking the lead in walking, drew wrinkles on his forehead with Isolet\u2019s mischievous voice.\u201cYou don\u2019t usually talk like that. The Duke\u2019s ideal type is\u2014\u201d\u201cIsolet.\u201d\u201c\u2014He like the kind of woman who wields sword, not only pretending to gain his attention, but is more than willing to join in real battles\u2014\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dWith his irritated tone, Isolet shut his mouth. However, he couldn\u2019t last long and made fun of him with his mouth.\u201cIt has been 10 years ago when I held back, but is it possible to compete with that Duke again?\u201dThat was ridiculous.Ten years ago, when Verndia was not still an adult.He once defeated the leader of one of the two imperial knights, Adenthal.Although it wasn\u2019t an official fuel, the leader still looked down on Verndia\u2019s skill. Despite it was late, carelessness was also a skill that anyone has.If he was old, he would have been the head of the Adenthal as he was.It became a mess as it was impossible to seat a minor in the position of a leader, not even being the Commander of them.He has nothing that he desire. He only wants to fulfill his duties as Duke rather than a knight.He didn\u2019t care about positions, but it would obvious that he would labeled as negligence Duke if he leave his land.He was rather satisfied with receiving an honorary knight position of Adenthal.It was like that 10 years ago, but now it\u2013\u201cWe\u2019re you trying to say that a Princess can be a swords master?\u201d\u201cNo, that was not what I was saying.\u201cIsolet whined as he watched Verndia, one of sword masters, accepted his joke seriously.\u201cI can hear you well.\u201d\u201cYes, you have good ears, too.\u201dIsolet groaned inside with his mouth shut. How did he become a servant to such a dirty boss? He must be sure to quit his jokes soon before he gets angry.Verndia, who doesn\u2019t know what Isolet was thinking, recalled what happened a few hours ago. Thus, the moment he faced my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s scarred hands.\u2018If I left it alone, it would only be a scar\u2026\u2019Then I was surprised and stopped walking, wondering what I was thinking.Isolet in the back was puzzled at Verndia\u2019s unusual actions.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s about Princess Psychke\u2026\u201dAfter a while, the answer came back.He asked Isolet to stop teasing him about the princess, but here we go again with the topic of the Princess. Isolet frowned.Verndia, who did not see it, said seriously.\u201cI think she have changed her strategy.\u201c\u201cWhat strategy?\u201d\u201cStrategy that catches my attention.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOther than that, people won\u2019t change overnight.\u201dWhat is this\u2026\u2026. Isolet pondered solemnly over the Psychke he saw today and a few days ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The woman who used to cling onto the Duke to the point that anyone who sees her pities her.She proudly asserted herself and did not care about others.All those pretty accessories and colorful dressed she used to wear around, has been strangely removed too.But was that really a strategy to attract attention?He even wrote a contract as a document of breaking the engagement off. Isolet decided to answer Verndia honestly.\u201cAren\u2019t you just attached to the Princess?\u201d\u201cIn a day?\u201d\u201cYes, well. People are different. Some fall in love at first sight, whereas others fall in love on later time. Or maybe her feelings for you were falling, but she exploded after holding it in.\u201d\u2018Is that why? Is that why she wanted to break up her marriage so much?\u2019Verndia was lost in thought, touching his chin.\u2018Surely. It\u2019s strange to say that it\u2019s just to attract attention.\u2019The report from the loyal lower rank, Crowe, which he had just received, made Verndia perplexed.Blacksmithing which specializes in ore, and the Magic Association.These were the places Psychke visited from the day she proposed the breakup up today.She wasn\u2019t just trying to help him with words, she was moving into real action.In those actions, we found nothing that could pose a threat to Lestir, Crowe added.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you not to be concerned about her.\u201dHalf serious and half joking, Isolet muttered.Verndia, who deviated from his thoughts, responded in a tone of absurdity.\u201cConcerned my foot. Who is concerned to whom?\u201dHe heard Isolet mumbling something, disagreeing at Verndia\u2019s words.But Verndia heard it all with his ears and ignored it.Then, as soon as he arrived at his destination, the Magic Association, he opened the door without hesitation and entered.He simply ignored the rule of knocking three times before entering and waiting for an answer from inside.\u201cOh, my. Duke!\u201dThe freaked aide cried sadly.Wizards are usually high-esteemed tribes.In most cases, if people did not follow the rules they had set, they would not meet them, let alone receive a request.But Verndia is the crazy dog from the north and he didn\u2019t care about it.Isolet followed him in a hurry, feeling like his lifespan was being cut off.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Duke? With his aide?\u201dAs expected, the pink coned hat wizard in the lobby clearly showed signs of disapproval.If it was someone else who came in here on a whim, the wizard would have poured out magic to drive them away.The wizard only showed signs of unwelcoming them, but she knew that it won\u2019t change anything if she\u2019d be hostile towards Lestir.Verndia said his purpose of bathing in without hesitation.\u201cI\u2019m here to see Lia.\u201dA medicine which temporarily quenches the flames of the heart. It\u2019s a medicine that\u2019s made to bless, and was handed from generation to generation to the Lestir Family, thus not anyone can make it.Lia Colt, known as a nerd among the Ice System Wizard.Only she could make it.In the present era.\u201cLia is away for the time being. She have works to do there.\u201d\u201cThen when is the day we can meet?\u201d\u201cBut she has many scheduled things to do\u2026 oh right, the Duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. It was written that the Dukes\u2019 fianc\u00e9e would go to North. Weren\u2019t you informed?\u201dThe wizard, who was checking by flipping through the list of registered wizards in the association, voiced his words.Verndia\u2019s expression became dark at the unexpected words.Crowe\u2019s report did not say anything related to that registration. It was because Crowe couldn\u2019t sneak in due to the association\u2019s rules and regulations.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cOops.\u201dThe wizard\u2019s face, who realized that he had accidentally leaked secrets with the customer, turned white.Verndia did not care and fell into his own thoughts again.\u2018Are you trying to meet the Ice Barrier Wizard in the Northern? That place is the Flame Realm, is it not?\u2019The use of ice magic for northern magic was a taboo among taboos.Not all, but most of them are known to be the type that gets stronger as it gets colder.\u2018\u2026 In no way possible that you\u2019re trying to raise more monsters in that area?\u2019That\u2019s how she planned to postpone the breakup as much as possible, right?The assumption of, \u2018I am asking for breakup because I\u2019d be out of touch\u2019, hit his head hard.This was just a new way to attract his attention.\u2018It was unexpected that she wasn\u2019t caught even Crowe had stalked her.\u2019He knew from a long time ago that she was smart.However, the actions she has shown have been very simple and transparent.It wasn\u2019t even in the early stages of engagement, and I didn\u2019t know it would come out like thisI let my guard down.\u2018Tsk..\u2019Verndia, who swept her hair roughly, clicked his tongue.\u201cI should go to Silkisia.\u201d\u201cWhat? At this time?\u201dIt was well past dinner. Even if he leave right away, it will be midnight when he arrive.\u201cI need to meet the princess.\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden? Duke! Hang on. Hang on!\u201cIsolet managed to catch him walking without hesitation.He seemed to be suspicious of her the moment he learned that she\u2019d meet an ice wizard.\u201cShe must had thought about this thoroughly. Isn\u2019t it just that she wants to talk about demonic matters? I must have not noticed.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous.\u201dIsolet never understand a word coming out from his mouth, but one things was certain.It is a great disrespect to visit a princess at this time.\u201cPlease let\u2019s go tomorrow. I\u2019ll write a letter of your arrival.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t write.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what else I\u2019m going to prepare.\u201dHe thought that he had to find excuse to be able to meet her if he\u2019d inform her. So he decided to go unexpectedly.It was Isolet who didn\u2019t comprehend what he said.He could not see why the lord valued the princess so highly, when she is known for her foolishness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t wear her wrists guards* this time around when she always wore them always.(TN: Wrists guards are used to protect the wrists against injury into a fall onto an outstretched hand. -from Google)Because today was not practice day, but a real sparring match.\u2018How long has it been?\u2019It has been a year since she put a sword against a neck of a real person.Yzhar called me out to practice my swordsmanship.Despite that it would a good thing for her, it only means that she have to defeat all of her opponent all day long.\u2018It was hard.\u2019Sparring was not the thing that\u2019s hard.In order to beat Yzhar.It was difficult to control her hand which always ended up in his vital point that would result to his death.In addition, he acted like my skills were lower than him.But Yzhar, who has a good eye, seemed to have noticed that she was better than him.After they sparred and learned that she was better, he asked Lenox or Knights as his opponent for his swordsmanship.When people asked him why he seemed to stop doing it with his sister, he came up with excuses such of he couldn\u2019t raise his sword against his fragile sister\u2019s body.People who listened to him disdained her.Those who did not know the behind of his excuse, thought that the foolish princess\u2019 sword skills were too low to be used as his practice opponent.\u2018I don\u2019t live like that anymore.\u2019I will never hide my skills just for their sake.She was ready to go out after putting pins in her baby hairs so that it won\u2019t fall down. Psychke picked up the teacup which originally Yzhar\u2019s that Melissa left behind.Then, I was about to throw it away in a vase.\u201c\u2026?\u201dShe paused as she was about to do it. Until a few days ago, the freesia in her vase was still new and fresh, but for some reason, it became dried and twisted. The color of it turned to brownish as if it had been poured poison.Was it just her, or the color of the flower was actually the same as the tea?I slightly touched its dried flowers with a finger.And as expected, it became powder and crumbled into pieces. This means that it did not wither naturally over time.Psychke\u2019s face which was alternately looking down at the powdered flowers and teacups, turned pale.***The Hall was no less noisy than usual.\u201cNo matter how much we don\u2019t know, it turned out to be like that. How can you say that words?\u201d\u201cI know ignorance is not a sin, but that\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201c\u201cI don\u2019t think that way.\u201dPerhaps they came to see the sparring match, and the soldiers were dressed lightly gathered in twos and threes.Noticing all of their stingy eyes and their occasional conversations, they seemed to be cursing her.Psychke ignored all of them and grabbed a wooden sword.I can guess why they reacted like that.\u2018Lenox must have twisted what I said at the caf\u00e9.\u2018In fact, the soldiers were not a bit interested in Psychke.They shared the same Hall, but that\u2019s all. Not anyone from the soldier approached the solitary princess who was not well-received by the public.The only thing new for her was the soldier who was practicing alone and stared at her.So she thought maybe there was no one who wants to fight with her.The Princess asked for a sparring, but if someone hurt her, it could mean death to him.But with this atmosphere, they\u2019ll fight each other, as if silencing the Arrogant Princess\u2019 nose.It wasn\u2019t bad.I\u2019m used to being cursed at.\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone heard about it.\u201cWhen did he come? As usual, Yzhar who was dressed in neat uniforms, spoke.The Hall quickly became quiet.The fine morning sun which melted into his short silver hair was dazzling. Psychke looked at her Older Foster Brother with a frown.Not feeling the gaze, Yzhar looked through the angry soldiers with insensitive eyes.Maybe it was because I\u2019m doing something that isn\u2019t my real intention. There was no light in her eyes.\u201cPsychke says he wants to fight one of you.\u201cAs soon as a finished speaking, a soldier raised his hand.\u201cThe princess might get hurt, right?\u201cThey weren\u2019t worried about her getting hurt, rather it was about the punishment they would receive.In this case, it\u2019s usually \u2018How dare you fight the Princess?!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s ridiculous, It would have been common for the Duke to let the Princess return to her room.\u2019He felt the will of the soldiers. Lenox seemed to get mad at the soldier\u2019s words, and put weight to the sword he was holding.\u201cPsychke is not a princess. She\u2019s being punished.\u201dThe eyes of the surprised soldiers were noticeable. She heard a lot of murmur everywhere.Psychke looked down at the wooden sword with her calm face.She made up her mind to leave the family that treated her unfairly. She felt like it was meaningless to do her best in the past when her family didn\u2019t have the slightest desire to recognize her.It felt like someone was digging her chest with an awl. To control her emotion, she gave all her strength to the wooden sword.The wooden sword trembled upon her strength.\u201cThus no one will be responsible if she gets hurt.\u201dThe man who had brought the Lord into the Hall finished his answer leisurely.In the meantime, if anyone wants to fight, he instructed them to step forward.However, the soldiers, who had been grumbling and complaining until Yzhar appeared, hesitated and did not step forward.It was quite shocking that it happened, and finally, a man stepped forward.\u201cI ask for a sparring with Psychke.\u201cA serious voice fell into her ears. Psychke knew the face of who just spoke.The thin breeze swept through his brilliant golden hair. Bright red eyes which resembled fireworks intertwined inside his eyes.\u2018That person is\u2026\u2019Aiden\u2026 his name was similar from that one.Only the name came to her mind vaguely, but I couldn\u2019t remember his last name.The reason Psychke, who was not interested in soldiers, knew his name, was because he was one of the few aristocrats.I heard that he got along well with other soldiers when he was from aristocrat and they\u2019re commoners without any trouble.His swordsmanship skills were also outstanding, but no one know why he applied as a private soldier instead of being an Imperial Knights Templar.He was also popular with maids because of his refined features and handsome face.\u2018As far as I know, it hasn\u2019t been long since he came to Silkisia.\u2019Psychke stood facing Aiden, reflecting on the rumors.\u201cI look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201d\u201cI look forward to your kind cooperation too.\u201dI thought he\u2019d underestimate me. He looked serious as if dealing with his colleague.\u201cPsychke, you can step out first.\u201cOriginally, I was going to finish him all at once. But I didn\u2019t want to fight him with my sword because he was someone who ignored me.However, I changed my mind when I saw Aiden treating me as someone arrogant.\u201cOf course.\u201dThere was a dust. Psychke, who attacked first for consideration for the weak, flew away.The moment Aiden, who was quite surprised by her fast movement than expected, prepared to defend himself.Ddak\u2013, with a loud sound, two wooden swords collided.A small groan came out of Aiden\u2019s mouth.\u201cUgh.\u201dHe was embarrassed by her power, but it didn\u2019t last long.His opponent, who did not fit her age considering her skills, pushed him away with a strength unbefitting of her thin body.Psyche swung her sword at an angle, letting her attacks flow. Because she won\u2019t use her mana.\u2018If it\u2019s a simple power fight, I\u2019m at a disadvantage.\u2018She slipped slightly to the side and approached him using her small body. Her silver hair tied together moved quickly along her trajectory.She floated for a while in the air and then landed on the ground swiftly. His red eyes honey sharply.It was a sharp attack from her, but he skillfully avoided her and did not relax. In the meantime, he tried to take the lead in attacking by tying the tip of their swords.However, Psychke immediately pulled out her sword and launched her next attack.That was how their sparring went back and forth.\u201cWhy is he being like this when their match is going to be over soon?\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait. Look over there.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before those who had criticized Aiden shut their mouths. All of them were enthralled, they observed a rivalry between talented people, which was not often seen.\u201cWhat did he do just now?\u201dSome people who were eager to imitate what they had seen can\u2019t helped but to feel itchy.\u201cThat kind of attack from that soldier\u2026\u201dPeople witnessing such scene in front of them calculated the position of the two people stepping on the ground, or the distance from each other\u2019s swords from the previous attacks they made and engraved it on their mind.The Hall was quickly filled with the heat of the two people sparring.Surprise, excitement, and shouting\u2014Although each had a different feeling. Everyone\u2019s faces were bright.Even Psychke and Aiden, who were fighting, smiled at each other.There was only one person who was not surprised or happy.It was only Yzhar.\u2018Why?\u2019What in the world that child has that she started to walk out of the dark place to a sunny place?I knew Psychke was better than me.That\u2019s why I was wary. He pushed her into the pit of sparring in hopes that it would make me reach up a bright place, however it only caused despair, dropping my hope.However, he kept his glimmer of hope so that he would not give up everything, and kept her in a desperate state.The larger the shadow, the greater the light. Psychke had to be his shadow. She shouldn\u2019t be superior than him.Now it was only a small trouble, but I couldn\u2019t erase the feeling that it was just the beginning.Yzhar clenched his fist. My neatly arranged nails left a half-moon-like wound on my palm, but I didn\u2019t even know it hurt. He stared at the two and thought fiercely.And when he was unable to get out of his dark emotions.Ta-ang!With a cheerful sound, a wooden sword that lost its owner drew a long parabola in the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s my turn today\u2026 Hey! Why are you hitting me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me today, dude! How dare you cut in line?!\u201dAs soon as I came to the Hall today, I was surrounded by soldiers with a look of respect.Psychke rolled her eyes silently.Her face was cold and distant, yet she felt embarrassed inside. It was her first time being recognized about something, and on top of that, her ability! It was awkward and embarrassing for her.Honestly, I had accepted all those who wanted to spar with me after with Aiden. But today, I wanted to rest after practicing alone.However\u2014How should I reject a pure request, and not a coercion?It was hard to cope. Because it was a first to be asked a favor.What saved her was,\u201cYou guys have no conscience at all. I guess all of you think it\u2019s okay because the Princess kept playing along with you, right?\u201dIt was Aiden, who appeared through the crowded soldiers with a nice smile.\u201cMiss is not a machine, you should give her plenty of time to rest.\u201dAiden, who said that, as if reading her mind, winked at her playfully. He meant for her to start practicing and not fight anymore.I moved my feet along the path he made for me. The soldiers did not stop her even though they were disappointed, visible in their eyes.Led by Aiden, we quietly walked away.Then, at the edge of the Hall where the training materials were placed, they stopped.\u201cThank you.\u201dPsychke expressed her gratitude.As she bowed down, her silver hair which she tied up earlier, fell down to her forearm.Aiden stared at it which looked like a shining sun.Then at one point, he became aware of the reality and hurriedly raised her head up.\u201cBending down to a private soldier like me? That was very unnecessary.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not even a princess.\u201dHe swallowed his question about her status, which he almost blurted out.Aiden, who grew up neglected too, smiled to her kindly, washing away the alertness from his eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not a princess. You\u2019re better than me, so you have to be treated as a superior.\u201dPsychke was respected mostly because of her swordsmanship, but also because of Aiden\u2019s admiration for her.She didn\u2019t know what is Aiden\u2019s position among the soldiers.It hasn\u2019t been long since he arrived here, but I knew that he was excellent enough to be labeled as one of the outstanding soldiers.In fact, he was a talented person who fought for 1st and 2nd place among the enlisted soldiers.Hence if he struggled as they sparred, she wouldn\u2019t know how she should explain it to everyone, and how would the soldiers see him.\u2018Actually, he didn\u2019t struggle.\u2018Yzhar was definitely worse than him, but Aiden was absolutely much better than Yzhar.I saw that he sincerely wanted to have a match with me, so I had fun dealing with him. Then I thought it would be okay by now, so I pretended to have won the hard way.Aiden noticed that she was far superior than him and passed it onto his colleagues.Additionally, there was a mix of feelings when he volunteered that he had been defeated as if he was afraid of tarnishing her reputation, but in truth, he just wants to fight fair and square.Attitudes, skills, personality, nothing was missing.\u2018Why did this kind of person come in as a private soldier?\u2019He could have joined the Imperial Templar.I was curious, but I didn\u2019t ask him aloud. Everyone has their own circumstances.\u201cNo, I was lucky.\u201dShe humbly accepted his praise.I took a deep breath, lifted the wooden sword, and prepared to strike a move on the woods barracks in front of her.Aiden, who had not diverted his eyes from her until then, suddenly spoke to her.\u201cMiss Psychke, do you have any intention to be a Knight?\u201dThe wedge-sharp wave sound from her sword stopped.Psychke stopped hitting the woods with her wooden sword and looked at him.\u201cA knight?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPsychke realized what he was trying to say.Usually, it\u2019s the Head of the family to decide for their children. Even is she dreams about it, if the Head doesn\u2019t agreed, she won\u2019t even have the chance to do so.However, once she entered the Imperial Knights Templar, she must need to put the Knights Templar surname rather than her real one.In other words, Aiden was implying why she doesn\u2019t leave Silkisia when she has ability to live independently, and they had humiliated her enough.It may be a unpleasant question, but the man\u2019s expression was so careful and serious that she was not upset.Psychke replied calmly.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t want to be a Knight.\u201dThere were two imperial knights.Ikaxia, and Adenthal.\u2018Ikaxia\u2019s vice-leader is my older brother.\u2019I didn\u2019t want to enter a place dominated by Silkisia. Rather than taking the family\u2019s name off, I was almost swayed.\u2018On contrary, going to Adenthal would have frictions of politics.\u2019The Imperial family, especially the Crown Prince wouldn\u2019t be please to see her, who was a former member of Imperial family.In addition\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to live like other ordinary people.Therefore, I must not get involve to something related about Silkisia anymore, nor should I do something that would bind me up from doing what I want.\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dAiden\u2019s expression darkened.Since she didn\u2019t elaborate it, it implied that she still wants to be in the Silkisia.Yet she didn\u2019t want to resolve what he misinterpreted.Psychke drew her attention from him. And again, I focused on the block of wood.\u201cIs it too late already..?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI couldn\u2019t hear him properly because of his small voice, adding that the wind blew strong.Psychke, who lowered her wooden sword, turned to him.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dAiden, who was deep in his thoughts, smiled softly. However, his soft smile was somehow anxious that she couldn\u2019t avert her eyes from it.Was there a story behind it?\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I ask for a request?\u201dPsychke nodded right away. Would it be a difficult request? He couldn\u2019t talk for a long time with his eyes down.The moment he finally opened his mouth\u2013\u201cMiss Psychke!\u201dSuddenly, a shout calling her from afar echoed.The two turned their heads toward it, alerted by the sudden call.\u201cThe Duke of Lestir is here!\u201dIn the middle of her practice, Melissa beckoned to come quickly.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019It wasn\u2019t possible that she made a ruckus this time, right? By now, it\u2019s amusing how Verndia came to me first when he never did in the past.I tried to think about why he came, but nothing came to my mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026 This haa.\u201dAiden swallowed what he wanted to say since Melissa was trying to take Psychke away.Then, with a feeling of difficulty, he bit his lower lip, frowned, and sighed.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201dShe was curious about what was going on, but there was nothing she could do either way.Psychke followed Melissa, pushing away her rising doubts.***Because I couldn\u2019t keep the guest waiting for a long time.Psychke quickly took a bath and prepared to go out.\u201cIf you stay like this in your room for a long time, you\u2019ll sweat.\u201dMelissa grumbled, saying her madness slowly, but did not try to help her dress up quickly. No, rather, she interfered with her by stepping on her feet or putting her clothes back in purposely.\u2018What is this?\u2019Verndia will be offended if she goes out late, and not only me but also Silkisia will be criticized.What\u2019s wrong with him?Like a person who drags time.\u201cKyaaa!\u201dPsychke who noticed that Melissa kept interrupting her, slammed the jewelry box where Melissa\u2019s hands were. Melissa\u2019s hands were swollen by it.Psychke clasped her hands and bit her lips from the ferocious maid.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was so distracting that I stopped.\u201dMelissa\u2019s excuse was false, but the latter was sincere. I even wore white silk gloves unconsciously. Mannerism ah.\u201cTsk, really..\u201dMelissa couldn\u2019t even say anything because she brought it on herself, and wailed silently.Then Psychke reluctantly guided herself to the waiting room only after asking, \u2018Isn\u2019t it too late already?\u2019Whether the news of her match with Aiden has spread, it was still confusing to find him here.The gaze of the employees she encountered in the hallway was unpleasant. As if they regarded her victory from the match with Aiden as a forced victory by threatening him with her status.I didn\u2019t care about them. Psychke walked upright looking only at the front.Then she spoke quietly so that only Melissa could hear what suddenly came to her mind.\u201cThe tea that you give me every morning.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dThe sharp, thorny question came back to her.When I thought of the brown tea, and the flower, Freesia, which dried up and died in the same color, made my blood boil in anger.But she continued calmly, trying to push away her inexplicably madness.\u201cWhat\u2019s its name? I owe you it every time, so I thought I should take care of it myself.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t have a name. Do you want me to bring you a bottle?\u201dIt was only a trick to say that she would like to drink it in the future again, but it\u2019s too annoying to get involve in that suspicious tea.Psychke, who didn\u2019t have to throw away her tea, welcomed it.\u201cOkay, then.\u201dThe steps of the maid walking a moment earlier became cheerful. She thought she was happy to relieve the hassle.Just like that, when I was about to step in the waiting room, something happened.\u201cOh, my. Miss!\u201dThey almost bumped into Lillian, who was walking, more on running, from the opposite side.Her rough breathing. Her red face, redder than apple. Even her body was shaking in anger.I felt like she was a person who had been complacent by someone.Lillian\u2019s bloodshot eyes flushed to Psychke, and then she ran away with a brisk pace.Surprised by the strange appearance of the lady, Melissa followed.Eventually, Psychke had to enter the Waiting room alone.\u201cSorry for being late. Have you been well?\u201dWhen I gently lifted my skirt and greeted him, Verndia, who crossed his arms with his legs, sat on the sofa, and looked up at her crookedly.\u201cI am not sick.\u201dHaving his face crumpled mercilessly, he snapped back.\u201cIt was said that Princess Psychke was the one who gave Princess Lilian a false hope, right?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.Psychke didn\u2019t understand him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was said that you arranged a meeting between me and her, thus she came to see me because she thought that I wasn\u2019t keeping my promise. Is that true?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, I had never done that.\u201dShe was speechless by Lillian\u2019s ridiculous lie. Then she calmly continued to say, whereas Verndia had his eyes shooting knives.\u201cThere was a time when Lillian wanted to see the Duke, and asked for your presence. But that was all.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dVerndia lowered his gaze at an angle and muttered to himself inaudibly.From his expression, his unstable breathing, and intermittent words, he seemed to be cursing Lillian.She didn\u2019t notice it first because she was preoccupied by Lillian\u2019s unexpected lie, and was suddenly swayed by her emotions. Only then did her eyes caught the teapot and teacups on the table.\u2018That was also the reason why Melissa kept on interrupting me to dress up quickly.\u2019Psychke, who figured out the whole situation, sighed and sat across Verndia.\u201cI will say this one more time, I have no intention of getting engaged to Princess Lillian. Please tell her to immediately wake up from her own dreams.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you say it to her yourself?\u201d\u201cI already did it, but I just want to ensure.\u201dAs expected. He was a tremendous person in many ways.\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m not here to talk about Princess Lillian.\u201dHis long and slender fingers wrapped around the handle of the teacup, was attractive. His red lips touched the edge of the teacup, and his throat trembled due to the tea, going into it.Verndia, after taking a sip, started to talk. Although he had already changed the subject, he looked somehow offended.\u201cI heard that Princess Psychke will meet Lia tomorrow.\u201dIf it\u2019s Lia\u2026 isn\u2019t she the Ice Wizard she was supposed to meet at the Magic Association? How did he know that?She tried to inquire of how did he know that, but he was a second faster.\u201cWhy do you want to meet with her?\u201d\u201cBefore that, Duke, may I ask how did you know that?\u201dPsychke\u2019s voice was cold. Due to her sudden uncomfortableness, and wondered if he ever had someone tailing her.Comprehending her reaction, he slightly tilted his head sideways, and explained unhurriedly.\u201cI was about to meet her because I had an errand for her, but I found out that she had a business with the princess. The Association\u2019s wizard told me about it. \u201cWell, no one knows who are the guests of Magic Association.She remembered that she told the Magic Association that she got along with Verndia well.She felt bad from lying that they were, but decided to not ask any more, since she had no reason to do so.\u201cShe is on her way to the Northern Castle for dealing with the monsters. My answer to your question.\u201d\u201cThe Northern Monsters for an Ice Wizard? Are you serious?\u201dHis expression on his face after she confessed the truth, was distorted a bit.She tried to hid the advice the Wizard gave to her.Now that things have come to this, Psychke thought it would be the right thing to do, so Psychke confided about the characteristics of the monsters and things which are related to the moonstone.\u201cI am speaking under the name of Silkisia, so please believe my words.\u201dAfter her long explanation, he then opened his mouth.\u201cHow did you know that monsters are being affected by cold weather?\u201d\u201cI saw it in my family\u2019s book.\u201dIn the southern part of the empire, there were many dungeons within Silkisia territory. It was for this reason that Silkisia became famous for their swordsmanship.Their family conducted how can monsters be minimized and their damages in the territory.Of course, the results were not shared with other families as it was the intellectual property of their family.Therefore, Psychke Silkisia\u2019s words belonged to a highly reliable axis, and the Duke who knew it was pleased.\u201cThat\u2019s why. They kept on resurrecting.\u201d\u201cYes. They will gain immaculate strength after they gained warmth. Therefore, one must use the moonstone to hurt it. It won\u2019t be easy considering that they are high-level monsters, but the good thing is that they are weak against cold, so even a small wound will slow their movements.\u201dAdd moonstone powder to a regular weapon and it will be\u2026Moonstone is a mineral which accelerates the corrosion of iron.It was a method that would never be used if it was just an ordinary battle.There was no better way to wipe them out but to use this trick and hurt them inevitably.Verndia calculated the number of monthly moonstones available at once, recalling his moonstone mines under his wing. In the meantime, he also measured the aspect of the battle to reverse the whole situation.\u201cIf one could lower their temperature, and not just wait for them to be vulnerable\u2026 oh, so?\u201dVerndia\u2019s eyes changed when he finally learned why Psychke tried to meet Lia.He felt sorry for his late understanding and even misinterpreted her actions.Psychke nodded at his words.\u201cYes, but it\u2019s hard to deal with it this way. Because\u2014\u201dHe looked at Psychke, who was explaining the characteristics of a magician-type monster, with his indifferent eyes.He wrote the contract, but never did he expected highly of her.The Head of Silkisia hated Lestir. So, let alone helping him to ask the Imperial Knights to move finding out about monsters was almost impossible thing, and they didn\u2019t even share the same characteristics of wiping them out.Hiring excellent mercenaries to find out their names was difficult enough, however knowing how to treat the monsters efficiently was another trouble. So Verndia was very grateful to Psychke for she violated the will of the head of Silkisia, and gave him information of the monsters.And as he went so far, he began to wonder sincerely why she wanted to break up their marriage.\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to ask the wizard if there\u2019s a way to catch Asum\u2019s attention.\u201dAs soon as she finished talking, Verndia changed the subject quickly.\u201cPrincess. Isn\u2019t the princess helping me for a quick breakup? To be precise, to take off the engagement ring?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to take it out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..?\u201dIt was the first time he had shown pure interest in her, who in the past only had him in her mind.Suddenly being frustrated, Psychke couldn\u2019t answer him immediately. She was a bit taken aback.Verndia, who mistook the action for a different meaning, knocked on the handle of the chair and said again.\u201cJudging from the fact that you hadn\u2019t said anything in the meantime regarding it, it doesn\u2019t seem like there is a problem with the ring itself\u2026 Do you have a lover?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201c\u201cYou can be honest with me. Was it because we\u2019re not in that kind of relationship?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really not like that. It\u2019s because of personal circumstances that have nothing to do with such reasons.\u201dHe knew it was true with the determination in her eyes.However, Verndia pretended not to know and smiled with his chin on his hand.His attractive eyes folded.\u201cI seem to not believing it.\u201dHe decided to admit it. Like Isolet\u2019s assumption, she may be getting bored without his attention and asking for a breakup.It was just an excuse to take out the ring because it was hard for her to say it straightforward.However, the curiosity has not been completely resolved to move on.Psychke, who had been watching so far, was not a woman who would go against the family for personal reasons. If she gave up everything for the family, she gave up. That\u2019s all in it.Why did a person\u2019s personality changed so much overnight?He was very curious. And he was the kind of person who had to put an end to anything he was interested in, so that he could be at ease.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t believe it.\u201dWhatever he thought of, he reckoned that it would be good. Psychke answered straight to the point where he thought she was acting at him.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dVerndia glanced at his fianc\u00e9e, who couldn\u2019t read what he was thinking.He inherited his title as a child after the previous Duchess of Lestir died in an unexpected accident. He had knack for dealing with anyone with his experience.For him, Psychke was a woman who gave him a very strange feeling.\u2018You don\u2019t sound like an idiot as the rumors said, so why are you hiding your real you?\u2019It was not long after they got engaged.Standing in harmony with her hostile family, he realized that others did not notice her knowledge.Psychke Silkisia was never a fool. Rather, she was smart enough to lead the evaluation of others in the direction she wanted.The problem was that the direction was a negative path.\u2018Why?\u2019Yeah, to be honest, he was interested in her in the beginning.He was curious at her due to her unfamiliar moves that he wasn\u2019t accustomed of, a person he never encountered previously.However, as the days went by, he attracted too much attention, so he kept a distance from her.He couldn\u2019t believe she was acting like such a fool with her excellent skills. While being wary of what kind of plan he might have.But now\u2026He looked down at her white hands which were pouring tea into his teacup.Now I know.It was not visible because of her gloves, but the fact that her swordsman\u2019s skills was underneath it, was a small but refreshing shock.Breaking their engagement, swordsmanship, moonstone, knowledge of monsters\u2026Those small shocks that occurred within a short time gathered and drew a huge stir in his quiet mind.Curiosity, which had faltered, ate the food and grew like a snowball.\u201cYou\u2019re cold-hearted. Still, we\u2019re engaged.\u201cThat line caught in his red lips, became darker.Surprisingly, he was nervous. This was because he did not understand the other person\u2019s feelings.\u201cOh, okay. Since we\u2019re here, I will ask a favor.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cTomorrow, to the Magic Association, let\u2019s go together. You said that you\u2019d be going to the Lestir estate, but it seems a bit unusual for me, who\u2019s concerned could stay still.\u201dIsolet voice which he heard while crying, was saying, \u2018What if she find out that Lestir, the owner of the flame, cannot control the flame itself?\u2019 but he ignored it.That wasn\u2019t what was important now.\u201cOkay.\u201dVerndia looked at the woman who answered expressionless. As if you couldn\u2019t approach her.He was curious and eager to know what she was thinking.It was the first time in his life to have this much of curiosity to someone personally.And Psychke, who didn\u2019t understand him, whose attitude suddenly changed.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019His always cool purple eyes were burning, as he was staring at her.With an unknown burden, Psychke avoided his gaze.(TN: Me to Verndia: Oho! This kid has admitted his feel\u2014Me to Psychke: You go girl!)Lioness's notes:TN's note: So, I read a comment related about my translation, saying that it's in\u00a0dire\u00a0of edit and proofreading.

But, she just thought that Aiden might still be there.Unfortunately, the Hall was empty.Wanting to relieve her disappointment, she simply went back to her room. But when her sight caught a glimpse of the note plastered on her desk, her expression stiffened.\u300cMaster took the tea because he had something to check.\u300dBefore meeting with Verndia, it was the reply from her order to have the tea bottle.\u2018It\u2019s the tea leaves that you used to give to me. What is there to check then?\u2019This has never happened before she returned back time. Despite being locked in that solitary room, Yzhar gave her that tea continuously in the name of her being sick, and she drank it until she died.She couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d removed the tea as soon as she noticed it.\u2018Was my timing right by chance? Or\u2026\u2019Psychke casually looked at the vase on the desk. The vase, which should be decorated with dead flowers, was already empty.Melissa could not have cleaned it up on her own accord, and must be an order from Yzhar.She felt that her mouth was bitter. She didn\u2019t know it would come out like this.\u2018She shouldn\u2019t have thrown the tea leaves that were on the teacup.\u2019Or wet the tea on a piece of paper.All that left were the pungent taste, the aroma of tea, and the feeling of dizziness when I drank it.It would disappear over time, and there will be no evidence.\u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do if it\u2019s inevitable anyway.\u2019It is useless to regret an irreversible thing.She decided to comfort herself. If from now on, and she saw suspicious signs, she must leave evidences.In fact, she have tea leave right in her hand, but even if it was identified, nothing would change.\u2018Even if they ask me about that tea, it\u2019s just deserving to say that I don\u2019t know anything about it. I shouldn\u2019t be the one apologizing for poisoning them accidentally\u2026 and besides\u2026\u2019She had been drinking that tea for over a decade.Although, the tea seemed toxic considering that the flower died.Only implies that the tea isn\u2019t that toxic looking that she had been drinking it over a decade, and she was still alive.She don\u2019t know if detoxification it will be easy. One could easily tell how much poison they had accumulated in their body through asking the priest.She should go to the temple as soon as she finish her work tomorrow. With determination, Psychke closed her eyes.***It was early in the morning the next day.\u201cWho is this Lia? Isn\u2019t she that woman who seemed addicted to revealing the Duke\u2019s secret whenever she\u2019s bored? And you like to meet that kind of person with the Princess?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut in the meantime, you\u2019ve only touched those things that I can fix.\u201dIn the corner of the Magic Association lobby, which was decorated with a red carpet, there was an aide who looked like he had died ten years ago.\u201cI don\u2019t know now. Even if the Princess will take advantage of you if she was informed by your weakness, I really don\u2019t know now.\u201d\u201cHush.\u201dVerndia, who cut off the aide\u2019s words, jutted.The owner of the shiny silver hair, who stood out from a distance, was opening the door and entering the lobby.Isolet banged his hands on his chest in frustration, and Verndia threw him\u00a0 away as if comforting him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let you talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIsolet\u2019s face turned pale and he was about to fall and die with a vase, but Verndia didn\u2019t spare him a glance.She passed though the aide calmly and arrived in front of her fianc\u00e9.\u201cSeeing the Princess early in the morning, I could tell that today will surely be a good day.\u201dverndia, who folded his eyes attractively, whispered to her sweetly.Psychke looked at him with her cold eyes.\u201cGood morning, Duke.\u201dIn front of the eyes of others, he was a perfect lover and fianc\u00e9.She didn\u2019t want to go with the flow and greeted him casually.\u201cDid you practice swordsmanship yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, I do it every day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that the princess wields a sword from either your family members or from your father \u2026.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t like me using swords.\u201cWhile the two were talking, a wizard from the association approached them. It was to guide them where Lia was.Verndia followed her and recalled the strange words he had just heard.\u2018Why don\u2019t they like her using swords?\u2019It could not be said that men and women were equal.It\u2019s not because there was no Knight to protect her, besides Silkisia was a family that is known for their swordsmanship.Although they became less famous because they only occupies the title of one of the Swords Masters.Lenox had no talent for swordsmanship, and even Yzhar, who would become Duke of Silkisia in the future, failed to take up the rank of commander of the Knights Templar when he tried.There were dark clouds over the future of the family famous for their swordsmanship. Shouldn\u2019t they cheer and encouraged whether Psychke was a real child or an adopted child?\u2018\u2026\u2026No, there\u2019s one.\u2019Come to think of it, there was a reason not to be happy that a fake princess wields a sword in Silkisia.\u2018If the princess exceeds the talent of the Head of the family. That must be the reason.\u2019When his thoughts reached to that point,\u201cYou can go in here.\u201dA cold voice awakened him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two people rolled it up, the thick black curtains were strange, but they went inside nevertheless.\u201cWho is this? Aren\u2019t you a cheeky child?\u201dA girl, wearing cute pigtails with pink hair, who just looked about thirteen years old, welcomed them.The child was sitting behind a large reddish brown desk with magic tools and various documents, and beneath it was a display of brilliant emerald-colored magicians.\u201cWho are you calling a child?\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want me to call you a baby with a fishy smell?\u201dVerndia snorted at the child\u2019s words.He don\u2019t care. Lia shook her hand in the air and summoned two chairs.Then, she beckoned friendly to Psychke, who was standing still.\u201cWelcome, welcome. Let\u2019s see. Your name is\u2026\u2026 Psychke Silkisia?\u201c\u2018That\u2019 Silkisia. Hahaha.Green eyes which resembled green vast scenery, twinkled as if they had discovered something interesting.\u201cOur rookie has a skill. You got engaged to such a pretty princess.\u201d\u201cStop saying such ridiculous things.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The reason I\u2019m here today\u2013\u201dPsychke stuttered at Verndia\u2019s sudden nod.She was puzzled because seeing the wizard first time in her life looked like a child.Unlike her immature voice, her eyes and attitudes were completely adult, so honorifics naturally came out.She had the type of magic that could freeze monster\u2019s wound if inserted into it,She asked for advice on how to deal with the monsters death.Lia held her chin with both hands and swung her feet that did not touch the floor.Then as soon as the story was over, she yawned loudly.\u201cWhy are you talking care of that yourself? What are you doing?\u201dVerndia, who was pointed out with a glance, responded harshly.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here together.\u201c\u201cYou made the reservation yourself. You have to take care of it yourself. You have to follow your fiance around, and you have to know that a baby like me doesn\u2019t have the ability\u2013\u201d\u201cIs there a way to ask the princess to do it?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201dIndeed, among the current Ice Barrier wizards, it was an answer like one of the best.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dPsychke welcomed her immediate answer without hesitation. However, she darkened her complexion with the following words.\u201cPay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already paid for it. When I make the reservation.\u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the price you came to meet me. It\u2019s right to pay extra to get an answer.\u201cIt was forced. At the time of the reservation, she told the association\u2019s wizard the purpose of her visit, and had paid the commission fee in consideration of returning after receiving an answer.It was disappointing because it was not a small amount. But the one holding the answer she was waiting for, was over there.She was going to ask how much more she should pay.\u201cOkay, what\u2019s that?\u201dVerndia took a step ahead. He said he knew this would happen, but he was annoyed.\u201cAs expected of our rookie. It\u2019s good that I don\u2019t have to explain it.\u201cWith a single smile, Lia took one of the parchment piled up on the desk and threw it to Verndia.It was the coordinates of an illegal auction house held two days later outside the capital.\u201cI heard that \u2018the item\u2019 is coming out this time. I want you to bring it. By the way, don\u2019t ask others to do it, but do it yourself. Because it\u2019s your job.\u201dIt was a request, but in reality, it was a threat that if he don\u2019t give what she wanted, she wouldn\u2019t answer them unless bring the item over.Verndia crumpled his face.It\u2019s like they have caught each other\u2019s weaknesses. She kept accepting those good things, but there was no end.The ability to control her heart\u2019s \u2018non-dissipating flame\u2019, is in her hands, he wouldn\u2019t have been dragged around like this if he had only met someone else with the same \u2018melting ice\u2019 magic.\u201cWhat is that item?\u201d\u201cNecklace that sting someone with a poison. Keitan\u2019s necklace.\u201d\u201cHmm? Didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t want to investigate more after you failed back then\u2026?\u201dVerndia, who stopped talking, wiggled his eyebrows. He wanted to take precautions in front of Psychke, and he said quietly so that only Lia could hear him.\u201cCan you say that in front of a Silkisia?\u201d\u201cOh, well\u2026 Honey, it was Silkisia, right?\u201dLia, whose eyes were round, quenched her lips silently.\u2018Shall I erase her memories with magic?\u2019\u2018You, you\u2019re not your magic major, are you?\u2018\u2018She can faint until she forget it.\u2019\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019While they were having such a conversation, Psychke was gently pressing her chest and calming her surprise.It was because of the word \u2018poisoning needle necklace\u2019 which Lia uttered.\u2018No way, it\u2019s not the same thing.\u2019Her hands trembled when she thought of the object that led her to death in her\u00a0 previous life. Because of that, she didn\u2019t even know that the two looked at her meaningfully.She thought it couldn\u2019t be possible, but she carefully started to wonder if it would be possible.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I know how the necklace looks like?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLia\u2019s eyes became round. Silkisia doesn\u2019t know this?Is she trying to know how does it looks like or she really doesn\u2019t know how does it looks like? To find out, Lia briefly explained.\u201cIt\u2019s just a normal gold necklace. Embedded in an emerald large enough to be rustic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..!\u201dThe word \u2018big emerald\u2019 opened her ears.Psychke breathed haplessly by the mention of the object that has the same shape as that necklace.At the same time, Lia\u2019s green eyes that looked at her became as thin as needles.\u201cWhat\u2019s the reaction? You really don\u2019t know what that necklace is?\u201dHis cold voice that sounded colder compared when Lia called him \u2018Honey\u2019.Suddenly, the atmosphere inside became cold as winter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hmm. Didn\u2019t I tell you because it wasn\u2019t a good story?\u201cShe spoke, and oddly, the temperature inside became normal again. She smiled again as if she was never mad.\u201cRelax, why are you that stiff?\u201dVerndia, who was silently watching the situation with his arms crossed, was dumbfounded at Lia\u2019s words.\u201cAnybody would be nervous if you appear like that.\u201d\u201cBut you aren\u2019t like that, ok?\u201d\u201cYou must have forgotten what a Lestir is capable of.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of that capability?\u201dHe can\u2019t even control it by himself.Lia gritted her lips silently so that only Verndia could comprehend what she held back to say out loud.Afterwards, she just mischievously winked at Psychke, who literally had no idea what should she do at the sudden mood.\u201cI was talking about your Fianc\u00e9. What is a disguise inside that looks good? This is a secret, but should I tell you\u2026\u201cLia, who was randomly and mysteriously laughing, leaned toward Psychke.Tilting her head, she suddenly frowned, closing her eyes and began to sniff.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s this?\u201dPsychke tried to get away from Lia, who suddenly approached her, but Lia had a good reflex, so she easily pulled Psychke\u2019s collar, preventing her from running away.Psychke thought that she could push Lia back, but oddly, she couldn\u2019t. It seemed as if she was enchanted.\u201cVicente? No, no. It\u2019s not enough to be called the power of God\u2026. I can\u2019t tell your strength. No, is it perhaps, what did you do to her?\u201cVerndia who was mentioned, made an ugly expression at Lia\u2019s words.\u201cNo, I mean it. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know her strength. Come here and check it out.\u201c\u201cI can\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know when it\u2019s yours?\u201dLia sighed out of frustration and held Psychke\u2019s hand.Then, as if appreciating a rare object, she picked up a sphere of bizarre magic and put it on and off repeatedly\u2014\u201cHuh? What\u2019s \u2026this?\u201dSoon she opened her mouth in astonishment.\u201cYou\u2026?\u201dDozens of emotions related to the shock covered her face and soon faded away.Lia, who was muttering to herself, narrowed their distance, placed her hands on the table. And whispered in Psychke\u2019s ear.\u201cYou, you were the person who have the powerful ability of the Great Silkisia all along.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe word \u2018ability\u2019 gave Psychke goosebumps. Psyche\u2019s face turned pitifully white.Pretending that she didn\u2019t see it it, Lia was so excited that she grabbed Psychke\u2019s hand and shook it wildly.\u201cOh, my God. I thought you weren\u2019t born because you were very quiet!\u201dLia\u2019s beautifully bound pink hair shook violently at her excitement. Her young voice and pale lips were clear as baby bird, chirping.\u201cWell, well, the thing I hate wasn\u2019t the Silkisia\u2019s ability. Now what\u2019s wrong with your energy? Did you eat something wrong? There\u2019s something like foreign matter mixed up all over your body. It would be impossible for you to even control them.\u201dShe kept whispering in Psychke\u2019s ears but nothing was heard. Psychke\u2019s head was spinning at the discovery of her cursed ability.Not even knowing that Verndia was overhearing Lia\u2019s sudden words, Psychke looked stunned and was shaken.Then, at some point, Psychke regained her senses and hurriedly stopped Lia\u2019s next words.\u201cBut aren\u2019t you adopted? That\u2019s strange. This kind ability \u2013\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dThe conversation stopped at Psychke\u2019s desperate call.Psychke mumbled her shaking lips. She managed to make up an excuse, but she appeared as if she would fall on the ground any moment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dShe pulled out her hand she tightly held. Then again, intertwined them and held each of her hand, reducing the anxiety she felt.\u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d\u201cWhat? No way \u2013\u201d\u201cNo, I am nothing. I have no meaning.\u201d\u2018This is a curse. You can\u2019t let anyone know!\u2018\u2018If this child is known to be alive in the Capital, there will be a blood storm in the empire.\u2019The words she heard as a child, echoed like thunders in her mind.She vividly remembered her past when she was chained up like a cold ball and was locked in the dungeon.It was frightening.\u201cI am nothing. I really am nothing\u2014\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stand it any longer because she was loss of words to say.Psychke, while covering her mouth, began to tremble like a leaf. She was so confused that she never thought Verndia would look at her.\u201cOh, my dear!\u201dUnexpectedly embarrassed, Lia summoned a cup containing cold water with magic.When something cold touched her lips, she strangely came to her senses.As Psychke was emptying the cup filled with cold water, with her trembling hands, the wizard, who definitely looked like a child patted her hard.\u201cWhat have you done?\u201dVerndia, who was staring at all the actions Lia made with his meaningful eyes, asked.Lia cut him cold.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know. I have something to talk to you about with this baby, so you go out for a while.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I saw Lia express her likes enough to call someone a \u2018baby\u2019.Verndia\u2019s eyes folded mysteriously, which had already caught something interesting in his sight.\u201cCan you just kick out a precious guest like me without a proper explanation?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you leave right now?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a certain extent from treating a trading partner and an elder, Lia. Don\u2019t give me orders.\u201dThe momentum of Verndia, who repeatedly said to Lia about her impolite courtesy and if she wouldn\u2019t treat him as he deserved, became violent.Lia, turning her head toward him, roared.\u201cDo you want to try?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do.\u201dAnother cold snap broke into the room which made it suffocating inside. But Verndia had no change in his complexion, as if he had not known the cold.Lia raised her hand, as if saying, \u201cI\u2019ll teach that overbearing little fellow how to behave.\u2019Then,\u201cHaa, damn.\u201dWith his words, he became hostile.His eyes were on Psychke, who had just put down an empty cup of water.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky today. You insolent little thing.\u201cLia jumped off the desk as he spoke sharply. Then she sat down in a swivel chair as she did when she first welcomed them earlier.When she turned the chair round, which had been swaying aggressively.The girl\u2019s face in front of Lia, which was cool like the middle of winter, was clear like the autumn sky after the rain.Lia called for her attention with a clap.\u201cWell, then \u2013 shall we continue with what we were talking about?\u201d***Since then, the meeting has been peaceful.In exchange for bringing the Keitan\u2019s necklace, Lia decided to hand over the ice magic formula, the way to stop Asum, and the medicine Verndia needed.\u201cThree things in one case. Why are you this generous?\u201d\u201cOh, have I ever been less generous?\u201dLia, who was so brazen with her sarcastic remarks, immediately put restrictions on Psychke.She had the illegal auction house, so she didn\u2019t get a \u2018legal\u2019 bid, but steal it \u2018illegally.\u2019\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cWhy, why. There\u2019s more interesting than that.\u201dVerndia, who was about to swear again, suddenly paused with a bit of hesitant. And he no longer stopped himself.\u201c\u2026 Damn it.\u201d\u201cMy baby, come and see me next time. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201dThe two people, the woman and the man, left the wizard\u2019s room, with Lia waving her hand gently to see them off.Psychke staggered from time to time, touching the wall.She couldn\u2019t feel her feet touching the ground. She felt no energy left in her body.\u2018Really, Silkisia. It was you all along who had the power of this generation.\u2019\u2018This is a curse. You mustn\u2019t let anyone know about this!\u2019Those words which came into her mind had a conflicted feelings and was alternately repeating.She couldn\u2019t even remember her purpose of coming here now.She trudged without knowing how Verndia was looking at her.Then her legs relaxed, and she almost collapsed.\u201cThank you\u2026 very much.\u201dFortunately, thanks to the capture of her fianc\u00e9, who had been giving her strange eyes, there was no mishap of her rolling on the floor.She said to herself that it was alright.Verndia helped her to the lobby.It was a strange kindness he gave her which was similar to what he did before their relationship went wrong due to Psychke\u2019s excessive interest in him, in which she didn\u2019t even notice.That was how confused she was.\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well, so I\u2019ll go in now. I have something else to tell you, so I hope to see you again tomorrow.\u201dAsking for his understanding, Psychke fled as if she was a bird. And because of that, she had completely forgotten her original plan to go to the temple.***Verndia did not take his eyes off his fianc\u00e9e until she became a little dot, and then slowly climbed into the carriage.\u201cDid you get caught?\u201dThe aide, who was in the carriage first, was nervous.Considering that his master\u2019s expression was so serious, he thought there was a situation needing his concern.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHis aide was asking him about his flames, which Verndia couldn\u2019t control.Verndia\u2019s eyes were asking him, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019He shut his mouth in embarrassment. And Verndia clicked his tongue.\u201cBecause you don\u2019t trust your superior so much, hmph.\u201dNo, then you should be nice to me.\u2026 murmured the poor aide to himself.Just by looking at his face, Isolet could tell what he was thinking. Verndia gave a bad impression.\u201cStop talking. Are you busy these days?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing urgent to do.\u201c\u201cLet\u2019s see if the Princess of Silkisia has ever been to the Temple of Vicente. Not Princess Psyche, rather Princess Lillian.\u201cHis servant, Crowe, could not sneak into a place where there was magic and power. Therefore, he entrusted the investigation to Isolet.With a triumphant look on his face, Isolet stretched out his chest.\u201cI\u2019ve already looked into all that. Who am I? I\u2019ve been your aide for five years\u2014\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s your conclusion?\u201dVerndia was furious at the repertoire he had heard so much about. Isolet quickly recited the information he had.\u201cOn the day she returned to Silkisia, there was nothing except for a paternity test.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d\u2018I heard that the high priest is back. Why didn\u2019t you go to the temple?\u2019No way. Am I that sure that Princess Psychke is \u2018that\u2019?Verndia stared out of the window and tapped his finger on the handle of the chair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLong ago, when the empire was found.The fate of the first emperor blessed him.However, the emperor, fearing that the power would be biased in one place, begged to divide the blessing and bestow it on his vassals, and Vicente accepted the request.Therefore, four families were born who hot this ability through the power of Vicente.The Northern Lestir.East Evergreen.Southern Silkisia.West in the Stella.However, each of the family can only have this powerful ability.But, it may also not exist to all generations that.The way to confirm this was to go to the temple of Vicente with the person concerned and receive a discriminant result from the high priest.There were other ways, but this was the most common method.That was the intention of Verndia\u2019s order for Isolet to investigate.\u2018Lillian Silkisia, have you ever went to the Temple to see if you have the ability?\u2019In history, the power of the family has been proportional to the power of the powerful.Thus, Silkisia, who was blinded by power, visited the temple right after Lillian returned.But she replied that she had never done so.What this means is\u2026\u2026..\u2018There is no way that Princess Lillian had received a discriminant.\u2019By the time Lillian had undergone a paternity test, Vicente\u2019s Minister was absent.However, it did not make sense to say that she met with the Minister before she disappeared.Why is that so, since Silkisia has already someone\u2026\u2018If not, I mean, I know someone who is already capable.\u2018If that\u2019s possible\u2026His heard throbbed from headache. Verndia closed his eyes, pressing his temples down.\u2018Then Princess Psychke really has the\u2014no, no way. This is uncertain. There is no evidence that the princess has that ability from that conversation alone.\u2019Devoting his time onto something unsure would be foolish.Verndia tried to put out the scene he had witnessed at the Association repeatedly.But it didn\u2019t work out.\u2018But, if Princess Psychke was not a woman with the ability, Lia wouldn\u2019t be like that earlier.\u2019Lia has never done anything unnecessary.She was the best ice wizard in the empire.She was a proud and arrogant girl, considering what she had showed earlier, it seemed like she was picking a star in the sky to gain Psychke\u2019s favor.But today she \u2013\u2018I have something to talk about with this baby, so you go out for a while.\u2018She had showed pure goodwill as a human-to-human conversation.Moreover, when she strangely acted like that.\u201cDamn it, what is it?\u201dNo matter how hard he focused on thinking about it, there was only one answer he could thought of.\u2018I thought she was dead or not born. Was she actually alive?\u2019Also, she was this close to him?He was not sure. He felt somewhat wary here.Verndia touched his face roughly.***Verndia was supposed to give her a ride in the carriage.But she refused.He decided to take a break from practicing swordsmanship, which she almost had not missed since she was tired both mentally and physically, and Psychke walked slowly toward the mansion.Her confused mind calmed down as she walked looking at the floor with an inorganic gaze.\u2018It\u2019s all right. Since it sounded like a mistake. Now that it has no meaning, it should be fine.\u2019She breathed and exhaled long enough to calm her pounding heart.How long have she walked?Before she knew it, she had been walking through the main gate of the Mansion and the road which leads to the gate.She noticed a familiar carriage.It was a carriage dedicated to the head of Silkisia family. Her foster father came back.\u2018So it was today.\u2019In her last life, her foster father, who had returned from a tour at the southern territories, held a light dinner for them.It was also an act to commemorate with Lillian\u2019s return.\u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t called you.\u2019Even if how sick she was, he would drag her, ordering her to sit down.She\u2019d never attend. She was determined until she entered the lobby.\u201cHey, put it in the garden!\u201d\u201cFlowers are scarce. Is there any place left?\u201dThis preparation is too much for a LIGHT dinner. The noise hut her ears.It was as if he had called all the employees the Mansion had to ready a party.She looked around, still curious was what going on inside. Unfortunately, her shoulders bumped with the employee, who was walking with the balloons in hands.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cThis is really, mind where you\u2019re going\u2026 Oh, my bad luck!\u201dThe employee murmured something she couldn\u2019t understand, but one word was clearly heard.\u2018A banquet celebrating the return of Lillian.\u2018Then, \u2018It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have enough time to invite the aristocrats.\u2019The conversations of employees, such as \u2018We can congratulate each other\u2019, were heard one after another.\u2018Why are they doing it already?\u2019In the past, her father was busy, therefore the dinner was held after a few months.She wondered, but she didn\u2019t worry deeply. For it had nothing to do with her anyway.\u2018I must not come out of my room at all.\u2019The voices of excited employees died down only after she went to the corner of the corridor connected to the stairs to the second floor.Psychke sighed lightly. Then, in the middle of the hallway, the sound of breathing was suppressed by leak through the slightly opened door.It was the office of her stepfather, Logan Silkisia.\u201c\u2026. So the information could not be sent.\u201dShe could hear the noise of them conversing. Since she belonged to useless people, she tried to get away as fast as possible.However.Her father\u2019s strange words caught me her guard.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe what I saw. That Lillian, how could she have returned?\u201dStrangely enough, he sounded angry.Yzhar, who was dealing with his father, also gave a puzzled voice, perhaps wondering if it was strange.\u201cThe temple has completed all the examinations. He reacted to all of the hair and blood I have from you father\u2014\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dThe Duke cried. Psychke had forgotten that she had to go, and focused her whole attention to listen on what they were talking about.She thought he\u2019d be happy. What\u2019s gotten into him?\u201cLillian, that girl in now way could have come back! With my own hands\u2014\u201dThe words inside the office were interrupted.She could see that it wasn\u2019t because she was caught eavesdropping.Probably since he talked too much. It seemed as if he had prevented himself to continue.She felt her blood cooling down. What did she just hear?She unhurriedly breathed in and out, fearing that she\u2019d get caught. Then she fixed her eyes to the scarlet light leaking through the crevice of the door.I heard the sound wandering inside the room. A middle-aged man\u2019s wheeze was accompanied by someone breathing.After such a short silence \u2013\u201cNo, not like this.\u201dThe duke uttered in a calmer voice.\u201cLet me look into this more. Don\u2019t mind. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens. That child is of no importance. What\u2019s important is Psychke! She would never \u2013\u201dSuddenly her name popped up.Psychke gasped after hearing him.Reflexively, she shut her mouth,\u201c\u2026 Is anyone out there?\u201dUnfortunately, it seemed to fall into the Duke\u2019s ear.She quickly looked around quickly. Three steps away from her, there was an armor displayed for decoration.Psychke did not hesitate to go there. There was no sound of her footsteps as she had of being a swordsman.The moment she just finished hiding herself behind the armor.The scarlet light, which seemed only like a solid line, widened, and a man with silver hair and black eyes appeared.\u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201dHe didn\u2019t just look at around. He even sensed the movements around him with his sharpened senses.However, Psychke, who was hiding nearby, could not be found by him.However, her father couldn\u2019t believe his son\u2019s words that there was no one out.\u201cI heard something. Go out and look everywhere.\u201dYzhar frowned, but came out and looked around.Suddenly, Yzhar moved his foot to the armor where Psychke was hiding. It was because it was the only thing where people could hide.\u2018What should I do?\u2019She unconsciously groped for things in her arms.There was the contract with Berndia, and the dagger for self-defense.That was it. Unfortunately, there was no tool to break the situation.In the meantime, the distance from Yzhar to her, was getting closer.Five, four, three steps\u2026Now that this happened, he grabbed the hem tightly, determining to go out with the frontal attack method*.(TN: The military tactic of frontal assault is a direct, full-force attack on the front line of an enemy force, rather than to the flanks or rear of the enemy. It allows for a quick and decisive victory, but at the cost of subjecting the attackers to the maximum defensive power of the enemy; this can make frontal assaults costly even if successful, and often disastrously costly if unsuccessful.)Her hands were damped with cold sweats. Her heart seemed to be beating right next to her ear.Now two steps.And then one step.At the very crucial moment, he could see her if he had come closer and twisted her body \u2013\u201cBrother!\u201d (Lenox)The voice of the Savior rang in the hall.Yzhar, who was about to bend down, looked up.\u201cBrother!\u201d (Lillian)It was Lenox and Lillian. She got sick of seeing them, who were always in her dreams.He bit his lips tightly as he felt the movements of the armor. Her heart skipped a beat.\u201cMy father said he was back. I came to greet him before seeing him at the party.\u201dLillian, with a lovely smile, was shy, twisting her hair.Yzhar nodded his head and led them to the duke\u2019s office.\u201cWhat about you, Yzhar? You\u2019re here already?\u201d\u201cNo, I was out.\u201c\u201cCrazy, really. Why are you wandering around being cheap these days? Are you going to make a lover in case you get kicked out?\u201dA derisive voice giggled.The sound of her footsteps faded away, and Lillian\u2019s charming voice went into the office.\u201cFather!\u201dIt was clearly the voice of a daughter who had just visited her parent after more than a decade.As if he had never been angry, the Duke of Silkisia hugged her tightly, shouting, \u201cLilian!\u201dThe echoes of the heartwarming reunion of the father and daughter, melted into the air as the door slammed and closed.She heard a few happy laughter, ringing outside.Her heart ached hearing them. The coldness of the wall pressed against her back, which seemed to penetrate into her inside.Psychke Silkisia, the only one who couldn\u2019t be a part of the family\u2019s happiness, stood in a daze for a while.Then after some meaningful time, she regained her senses, escaped from the narrow gap where she was, and headed for the path she had been thinking to go to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay~ 16 ~\u201cPsychke, are you inside?\u201dWhile laying on the bed, Psychke was staring blanky at the ceiling.Behind the knocking to her door, she knew exactly who it is, but more importantly the fact that the person shouldn\u2019t be here.Psychke doubted her ears. Then, after the visitor called her once more, she got up and opened the door.\u201cI heard you\u2019re back, so you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 \u201dThe word \u2018father\u2019 has no meaning to her.Psychke bit her lip.The Duke and the head of Silkisia has a distorted expression, perhaps because of her response.Psychke, who let him in, muttered reluctantly.\u201cWhy\u2026 have you come here?\u201d\u201cIt had been a while since we last saw each other, and you even haven\u2019t said hello to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Recently, you looked quite fine.\u201dIt may be a while for her father, but for her, it was a rather quick reunion, who had gone back in time.Moreover, she was unjustly killed in her last life, therefore, him being here doesn\u2019t deserve her welcome.\u201cHmm.\u201dUnlike before when I tried to look good in front of her father, she doesn\u2019t have that stomach to be like that anymore.While looking at Psychke, who wouldn\u2019t make a single eye contact with him, the Duke felt rather strange and concluded that something was definitely wrong.He tore down his expression in an instant, then straightened his posture as if nothing had happened.\u201cYes. You\u2019re also doing well here, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to alter her boring reply to him.Psychke answered him rather brief and after a moment, she told him, while looking at the bed.\u201cI\u2019m tired, so I ask of your kindness to leave now.\u201dHe was displeased and wiggled his brows. He quickly dissipated what he was feeling, and the corners of his mouth trembled.\u201cYou can rest a little later. We have a welcoming party for Lillian\u2019s return.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone in the house is present, so don\u2019t miss it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cCan you not at least look at my face?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s hard to even move. \u201cPsychke cut his words off embarrassingly.\u201cI\u2019ll say my congratulations to Lillian separately. I didn\u2019t even get a present for her anyway\u2013\u201d\u201cPsychke.\u201dThe duke, who cut her words in return, paused as it to look at her face.But Psychke never raised her eyes to him.The Duke stared at her with his expressionless face. He seemed like a person who wanted to see through what the other person was thinking.Then he suddenly smiled sweetly and spoke softly.***\u201cOh, my God.\u201d\u201cShe has no shame. Does she know where she is right now?\u201dSeasonal flowers, colorful balloons, sweet music, and fragrant foods.As soon as she entered the beautifully decorated garden, lots of eyes landed to her figure like a dagger. The same goes to their sharp words.Ignoring all of those clear insults, Psychke moved forward.In her head, the behavior and the way the Duke of Silkisia spoke, which she had just experienced, were floating.\u2018Just exactly why?\u2019The duke had never said anything friendly to her because she was only adopted.It was all about throwing compliments like he was treating a beggar who was kind.However, just now\u2026\u2026.\u201cI really want you to come there.\u201dHe had asked her to attend Lillian\u2019s return, acting sweet and close as if to coax his grumpy daughter.As he said that, Psychke had decided to attend the party.She didn\u2019t feel the affection of a father from her foster father\u2019s sugarcoated words.That moment,\u2018The important thing is psyche! That kid would never\u2013\u2018The conversation she had overheard kept bothering her.Also, the strange atmosphere of the Duke, who almost in his life, neglected her, has changed overnight.What the hell is he up to?! It\u2019s worrying her.\u201cYou came, Psyckhe!\u201dA clear voice resonated through her busy mind. She then saw Lillian\u2019s radiant smile when she saw her. Her beautiful silver hair which had pins and made of expensive jewels.White pears and diamonds were hanging on her ear and neck, which were pale as ever.The light pink dress, reminiscent of spring flowers, danced in waves whenever the owner, Lillian, moved.\u2018She usually wears flashy dress, but now\u2026 she looked quite not bad.\u2019It was the opposite of what Pyschke looked like in plain clothes.She thought that this was the clear difference between the real and fake. It even illuminates through Lillian\u2019s dress.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t come. I\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d\u201cBecause you shine more when I\u2019m with you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dShe guessed that she was pretty twisted inside.The sincerity that she had swallowed by force came out recklessly.Looking at Lillian\u2019s innocent face, crushing down, Psychke couldn\u2019t help but to laugh.Her sneer turned to a grin and congratulated Lillian for her return.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI mean it.\u201dIf Lillian hadn\u2019t come, she would have still lived longing for a love that she would never receive for the rest of her life. Psychke smiled as she looked at Lillian, who seemed to be judging whether the words from her happiness were sincere.She was literally in a bad mood, but she kept laughing somehow.Might be because of the fact that Lillian acted innocent as she could.Or, she didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she had heard strange things about Lillian directly from her family.\u201cAre you arguing with your sister again?\u201d \u201cDid you say hello to your father?\u201d \u201cYou seem to go out too often these days, so please refrain from going out.\u201dLenox, Yzhar.Terrible families.Drinking red wine like blood with their words in one ear.Drinking wine as red as blood, spilling their words and going in her ears.\u201cToday is a very happy day.\u201dWhen the duke returned from his hard work, he made a long speech, starting with, \u2018How can I not be happy when my daughter, whom I thought was dead, came back uninjured and alive?\u2019Psychke did not bother to listen.She knew what he was going to say, since she have heard it before in her last life.Although the real princess had come back, the castle of Silkisia\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t recovered at all.However, she will not be able to act as one of the Silkisia from now on, and even her title as a princess became unacceptable for people since she was a fake one.Oh, she shouldn\u2019t have come.Just the thought which lingered in her mind, made her heart throbbed. She bitterly emptied the glass of wine, ignoring how she was hurt inside.And when she had just taken off her lips from the glass\u2026A voice like a bolt from the blue hit her ears.\u201c\u2026 Never forget that even though Lillian is back, Pychke is also a stark of Silkiisia.\u201d\u2018What kind of\u2026.? What is this?\u2019It\u2019s exactly the opposite from what she remembered.Psychke looked up at the Duke.There was a cold silence in the garden, and everyone was looking at the same place with their embarrassed faces.The Duke scoured the frozen. Then, the moment she made eye contact with Psyckhe, the Duke stated.\u201cPsychke Silkisia. To set an example as Lillian\u2019s sister and the first princess. I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201dSilent consternations covered the garden once again.And,Clang clang\u2013A glass dropped by someone foresaw a strong wave.***The party celebrated its return soon ended.The Duke admitted in public. For Psychke, the castle of Silkisia is still alive.In addition, by calling her \u2018Lillian\u2019s sister\u2019, he implicitly implied that Psychke was higher in rank than Lillian, even though she was the same princess as before.Psychke and Lillian turned white, Lenox\u2019s eyes turned as big as a full moon, and Yzhar stared at his father with his stiffened face.The atmosphere between the Silkisia, which should be the one celebrating and happy were tarnished, and now, what could the rest of them say?The banquet ended in confusion.The duke left as soon as he finished his closing address.Yzhar, who had a dark gaze throughout the party, chased him and complained.\u201cWhat do you mean, Lillian\u2019s sister who doesn\u2019t even know where she came from? My father\u2019s bloodline, my sister. This is ridiculous.\u201dA voice echoed like a cave in the empty hallway.The Duke stopped his foot. Wearing the mask of a benevolent father throughout the party, he stared at his son with a fearful look.Then he shook his fist unannounced.There was a clatter of flesh. Yzahr head swung to one side.\u201cI told you to keep an eye on Psychke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe has changed. Silkishia has changed more than anyone else, and the girl who used to follow me around has changed too!\u201dHe gnashed his teeth at the thought of the adopted child he met before the party began.Psychke\u2019s eyes, which had always longed for his affection, were nowhere to be found. Her gesture which shows her fright of being abandoned and her scared voice of being discarded away had vanished as if it was never there to begin with.He had been wondering about it since Lillian came back, but he never knew that it was this serious. It was a disaster.\u201c\u2026 I am sorry.\u201dYzhar replied, swallowing the blood in his mouth.It\u2019s been like that for a long time. His father worked on Psychke to the point of wonder.After adopting her, pretending not to be interested and isolating her from people around them, he brainwashed her by saying, \u201cAll you have left is your family.\u201dThe father was not the type to give affection to his children. Thus, he didn\u2019t believe in Lillian\u2019s replacement in the first place.He doesn\u2019t know why he brought that crap (Psychke). He followed the meaning, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure he brought her in for some reason.\u201dHowever, as the matter came to this point, the question that had been suppressed deeply in his heart came to the top of his head.Who the hell is Psychke?Why is he working so hard for that adopted child?\u201cSince when did she become like that. Huh? Since when she changed?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I think it was from the day Lillian came back.\u201dYeah, the Psychke that day was definitely weird.Resignation, futility, indifference. Her gestures and speech that seem to have given up everything.He thought that perhaps because that she was only growing up, but it wasn\u2019t that reason.Since the real Princess is back, she must have realized that no matter how hard she struggles, there is no place for fake people.\u201cLillian, Lillian. Ha.\u201dThe Duke, who has pondered his own daughter\u2019s name dozens of times, frowned.He let out a long, troubled breath, then recoiled his neck with one hand covering his eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing these days?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking about Lillian, she was still learning how to become-\u201c\u201cNo! Not her, I mean Psychke. I heard that she had gotten closer to a soldier.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I\u2019m trying to get an excuse and send it out before they get any closer. There\u2019s nothing else. Except for increased encounters with the Duke of Lestir.\u201d\u201cVerndia, with that guy?\u201dThe Duke of Silkisia, who remembered that the installation did not fit the subject they were talking about, laughed coldly.\u201cShe must be leaving Silkisia for that Lestir. I wouldn\u2019t take that, stupid.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll attach the guards.\u201d\u201cYou idiot. She\u2019s better at swordsmanship than you are. Are you trying to tell me you weren\u2019t watching her?\u201dYzhar clenched his fist who had heard his hidden inferiority complex.Blue veins popped out on the back of his hand, and his shoulders, which were firmly strengthened by swordsmanship, trembled.The duke clapped his tongue at the piteousness.\u201cWe must change her mind at all costs. I mean, let me know that Silkisia is the only place for her to be. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dPsychke is an adoptee, Lillian is not self-aware as a princess, and Lenox is still young, but unclear.Yzhar is the only one whom he can entrust the future of Silkisia.What should he do when he is not this reliable?The duke left with a deep sigh innocently.Yzhar, who was left alone, stood still for a while with his head down with his face that he didn\u2019t know what he was thinking seriously about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Verndia, who was lost in his thoughts, frowned.\u201cWhere is the place you\u2019re talking about?\u201dDon\u2019t tell me, no, it can\u2019t be.Even though she was thinking that way, she couldn\u2019t put off her uneasy premonition.He had no idea what was in her little head that she looked anxious.And her mere premonition became the reality she didn\u2019t want.\u201cThat illegal auction house that Lia mentioned.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Do you know what to do about it?\u201d\u201cI know. I am going to steal it.\u201dVerndia breathed a deep sigh and the confirmation she said.She could see the ridiculous expression he had, but she also couldn\u2019t back down. As if she wanted to this either.\u201cAre you bored?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get permission. You know what I mean.\u201dThe same had happened in the past.She couldn\u2019t remember the exact date when that happened, but there was an article related to that auction house that there was an illegal theft.The story was that the criminal could not be caught, but there was no lost item.Around the same time that happened, Verndia sent her a letter which contains saying that he was feeling unwell and wouldn\u2019t be able to see her for a short while.To sum this up\u2013Verndia was ordered to rob the Keitan\u2019s necklace in the auction house.However, Verndia miserably failed and after an unknown process, the necklace was discovered to the SIlkisia mansion where she was falsely accused and died right after.But, the Duke of Silkisia made a different move than in the past. He said that he\u2019d me keep as the a princess now.I couldn\u2019t be at ease. Verndia has to make to sure that he\u2019d be successful in stealing the necklace.\u201cWhat kind of thoughts are the hell you\u2019re thinking?\u201dVerndia couldn\u2019t stand the atmosphere between them and revealed his innermost angrily.However, she couldn\u2019t possibly say that, \u2018I\u2019d come to you even if you fail.\u2019, so she made a reckless move.\u201cTwo would be better than one.\u201d\u201cIf one didn\u2019t do a good job, the other one will suffer the most.\u201dSelf, need to stay calm. Do you understand?Her fianc\u00e9 glared at her ruthlessly but she didn\u2019t care.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve told you the reason.\u201d\u201cIf you were going to do whatever you want, why bother saying that?\u201d\u201cRing, to cover up the ring.\u201dHis casual glance ended up to her left hand which had the engagement ring, as it glowed with the subtly gold color, resonating from within.Only then did his ugly expression was wiped away, thinking that the ring would constantly shine every time he\u2019d look at it.\u201cIsn\u2019t it better if the princess didn\u2019t come?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going because I want to.\u201dHa\u2026The duke, who had breathed heavily as if in disbelief didn\u2019t put off his hand from his face.Then, he thought of something and looked at her with his puzzled expression.\u201cNo way, princess \u2013 are you doing this on purpose to fail?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dPsychke wrinkled her brows.She said that she would help him. How did he manage to think that way somehow?\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of breaking up the marriage between us, but you can\u2019t keep the contract, so this is how it comes out.\u201dShe guessed that she was too speechless to say something in return.There was a silence between them. Psychke looked at Verndia for a moment and sighed, as if she gave up explaining, looking at somewhere else.\u201cDuke, can I be honest with you?\u201d\u201cNo matter what you say, my thoughts won\u2019t change\u2013\u201d\u201cI want to break up my engagement right away.\u201dWith her mad expression, she interrupted him cruelly. It didn\u2019t matter to her if it was rude for him or not.\u201cIsn\u2019t it only because of my father that you keep our engagement? You\u2019re afraid that if we break upi, you\u2019ll be out of favor with the knights.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dVerndia, who was hurt, was dumbfounded.\u201cYes, I understand what you mean, Duke. I know it\u2019s because of my attitude towards you in the past. But people change, thus I have no feelings for you anymore. I guarantee that I will never ever have again.\u201d(TN: *throws a slipper, and proceeds to say, \u201cEmOtiOnAl DAmaGe!\u201d lel)She thought she would hear something from him since she uttered the words he didn\u2019t want to hear in his face.Verndia was stupefied and had a stunned look on his face.(TN: Man was too stunned to speak lmao)This is the first time this has happened, and what he feared just happened.With his overbearing aura, height and force, he received everyone\u2019s attention just by simply breathing.Even political opponents dared not provoke him in front of him, who is called the Mad Dog.But she said those words to him, as if she didn\u2019t chase him everywhere when he was uninterested of her.His shock was too great to even explain.No matter how long she waited for him to open his mouth, he didn\u2019t make any sound.Now that he has to leave her seat and had gotten up, Psychke made a firm decision.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about anything because no matter what happens, I\u2019ll definitely break our engagement. Then, I shall get going first.\u201dVerndia only looked up to her with a bewildered look on his face, but did not stop her.She walked out of the living room with a last bow.\u201cLet\u2019s talk for a moment.\u201dAnd then she was unfortunately caught by Lillian, who was menacingly looking at her even from afar the living room.Looking at her face, Lillian seemed to be waiting for a long time until she finished talking with the Duke.\u201cHow can you do that?\u201dThe bottomless questions flew in.(TN: don\u2019t mind me, just\u2026 this b*tch is someone I would be willing to rip off her mouth)Her face was too pale after her question. Her eyes and nose were so red as if she was weeping, and her breath was unsteady with excitement and anger hidden within.Contrary to Lillian\u2019s fiery temperament, Psychke replied ice-coldly.\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cYou said you\u2019d give up everything.\u201dLillian was trembling with contempt and grabbed her empty chest, and proceeded to cry.\u201cYou said that you\u2019d give up the princess title, and the duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e!\u201dYeah, it was.The day when Lillian came with Lenox and Melisa. Pyschke indeed told her that she\u2019d give up everything that is fake, and Lillian is the real one.She kept my word faithfully.But the person opposite her doesn\u2019t think that way.\u201cYou\u2019re so mean! Very mean!\u201dLillian thought that the fake princess in front of her was merely deceiving her.Lillian was crying dispiritedly. Her tears around her eyes disturbed her beautiful cheeks.\u201cThat isn\u2019t yours to begin with! They are all supposedly mine! You have to give them back when the owner wants them!\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cBut why does father and Duke Verndia keeps being around you? You\u2019re just a fake one! On contrary, I am the real one!\u201dIn the past, Lillian failed to win Verndia\u2019s heart.However, Lillian succeeded in firmly establishing herself as a princess of Silkisia, so she did not act this way.It was all about pretending to be innocent, pretending to be nice, and throwing sympathy like she was always the victim and Psychke was the enemy.But now\u2013\u201cIt\u2019s no doubt! What did you say? You begged me not to throw you away, and that you\u2019ll do anything? You also said that you\u2019d give everything back to me!\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cLies! It\u2019s all because of you. Because of you, it\u2019s all because of you!\u201dLillian swallowed the last words, and sobbed loudly while burying her face in both of her palms.Psychke frowned and touched her forehead and closed her eyes.The constant headache she\u2019s having, lack of sleep last night, and Lillian\u2019s foolish whine were combined that it created an immaculate pain. It wasn\u2019t because Psychke didn\u2019t know the wrong from Lillian. Rather, it was her sympathy that troubles her.She knew better than anyone how miserable it felt to be taken away from others what she thought was her.So, she had no reason or obligation to appease Lillian. How can the victim comfort the perpetrator?\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself, Lillian.\u201dWhen she counted to ten inside her mind, her headache subsided a bit.The conversation itself was tiring, but it was very unpleasant to be misunderstood as it is.Psychke decided to get the facts straight, with great kindness and patience.\u201cI never asked anyone to let me stay in the Duke\u2019s house after you returned.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019d believe that?\u201d\u201cWhether you believe it or not, it is up to you.\u201dShe looked numbly at Lillian\u2019s bluish eyes.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like me so much, tell my father. Go after the fake me.\u201d\u201cDo not be ridiculous. After everything has already been baked and boiled\u2013\u201d(TN: I guess Lillian means that, \u2018After everything has been decided or made\u2019, sort like that.)\u201cMy father can\u2019t take my fake words more seriously than yours.\u201dPsychke let out a deflating laugh.\u201cOr are you not confident?\u201d\u201d \u2026 What?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe took a step forward and closed the distance with Lillian. Then, she lowered her voice so that Verndia, who was in the drawing room, could not hear her.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s stay that I begged Duke Verndia to keep our engagement. Then the duke\u2026 the only means that he valued me more than he does to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe same goes for father.\u201dPsychke, who criticized her, stepped back and tilted her head slightly. Lillian stood blankly, not even thinking of wiping the tears flowing down to her chin.She may not believe it, but Psychke didn\u2019t do anything big.\u201cI know you want to blame me but do it moderately. Unless you want to show to the world that you\u2019re worse than me.\u201dAt the end of her sentence, Psychke turned her back away from her.Until when she turned to the corner of the hallway, Lillian\u2019s persistent eyes followed her, but Psychke didn\u2019t care and left the place with a steady pace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was surprising.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m annoyed.\u201dJust once. She had met Lenox in the hallway when she was going to the hall.Instead of throwing tantrum such as, picking up a vase and throwing it to her, he asked why she made his sister cry. He frowned and gulped all the swear words he could think of blurting out and slapped her shoulder hard.It\u2019s probably because of what her father said at Lillian\u2019s arrival celebration.But in a few days, Psychke thought he would be back to normal.\u2018But really, why did he change?\u2019She could not comprehend the sudden change of the Duke.She did everything she could, but he never said any soft word to her, not even a single word for 188 years.However, why are you doing this so sudden and decided to put everything in the opposite direction?\u2018\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t care.\u2019Right, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the duke changed or whatnot.No matter what he said to her or what he did thus far, her determination to leave Silkisia would remain the same.Psychke looked into the full-length mirror in front of her. Her long silver hair was tied together and she was dressed modestly; she could see herself clearly in front of the mirror.She wore the bracelet which has a chant that could change her appearance and checked if the robes contains invisibility was inside, and left the room.\u201cWhere are you going at such a late hour?\u201dAnd then, she met Yzhar in front of her door. He was leaning against the wall as if he has nothing to so and was watching her.He looked like someone hit him. One of his cheeks was slightly swollen.She curiously wondered in her mind who dared hit the Duke of Silkisia, but didn\u2019t express it loudly and replied to his question.\u201cI want to go for a walk.\u201d\u201cTake an escort.\u201dPsychke shook her head at his arrogant tone.\u201cI feel comfortable being alone.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of princess in the world walks without an escort?\u201d\u201cI understand that the punishment that brother has inflicted on me is not over yet. I am also not a princess.\u201d\u201cNo, father took it.\u201dAs expected, this is incredibly weird.Until now, the Head of Silkisia had never been involved at Yzhar\u2019s punishment to her.When she was a child, she accidentally dropped her food on the floor while eating.Miserably, she was kicked out in the middle of cold winter while only wearing her pajamas, and her father didn\u2019t bat an eye.What is it that is changing his course?I was curious, but this, too, was not revealed outwardly. Psychke hid herself with an expressionless expression.\u201cThat\u2019s right. But like as I said, I\u2019m comfortable with being alone. Just because they are with me, doesn\u2019t mean nothing will happen.\u201dShe looked at the distance and implied these words with her eyes, \u2018How can people with lower skills than me escort me?\u2019, it was what she meant.To put it bluntly, it was demeaning to the soldiers.Even if it was the truth, she did not want to criticize those who recognized her skills.\u201cDon\u2019t be conceited.\u201dYzhar frowned.\u201cThis, too, was directly ordered by father.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did father tell me to have escort?\u201dIn an instant, Psyckhe realized.This wasn\u2019t about the escort or anything. No one, who knew my sword skills better than anyone else than him, would want to waste his manpower for me.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he nodded as if motioning someone. As soon as she paid attention to the surrounding, a familiar face caught her eyes.\u2018\u2026. Aiden?\u2019While embarrassed by the unexpected meeting, Aiden, who came closer, bowed in silence. He had a more serious face.Yzhar slowly opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s why I chose and designated a talented person for you, so I want you to thank father.\u201d\u201cNo, I-\u201d\u201cFather said that you are restricted of crossing the main gate without an escort, as people who hold grudges against you might come running on you, takins Lillian\u2019s return as an advantage. Therefore, if you will mention that you\u2019re comfortable being alone, stop.\u201dPsychke bit her lower lip. Just how much she had wasted arguing with Yzhar now?Soon it was time for the auction to start. She couldn\u2019t delay any longer.I don\u2019t know why the security around me is being put on but getting out of this mansion right now is the priority.\u201c\u2026. All right.\u201dIt was already fortunate enough that her escort is someone she already knew. She then left the place with Aiden relentlessly.And as soon as she reached a dark alleyway out of Yzhar\u2019s gaze, she stopped her feet and she turned to him.\u201cSir Aiden. I\u2019m sorry, but I have a request.\u201dIt was said that she and Verndia would meet personally.Aiden is a private soldier of Silkisia, thus he followed what the duke ordered him to do first.If it\u2019s too late, I\u2019ll have to pass. Thinking about how she could get his consent, she shook her head.But before Psychke could do anything.\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201dAiden said politely. His red eyes contained Psychke\u2019s figure were calmly submerged.\u201cI will be waiting for you here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you know where I am going?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know, Princess.\u201dIn a strange situation, Psychke narrowed her forehead.\u201cThen do you know when I will be back?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201dHer vigilance surged instantly when she got what she wanted in an oddly easy way.He was a kind person from the private soldiers. However, no one know what would happen if he violated against the Duke order.Gently lowering his gaze, Aiden asked a question out of the blue.\u201cDo you know my name, Princess?\u201d\u201cAiden\u2026\u201dShe was trying to blur his surname because she didn\u2019t know it, so he answered instead.\u201cI am Aiden Hillace.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHillace.Wasn\u2019t his family one of those families who blindly followed Silkisia?She then has seen Hillace previously! Baron Hillace have come to the duke\u2019s house to meet her father.She had a mean impression on him, unlike Aiden who was definitely opposite to him, therefore he couldn\u2019t have been easily forgotten.He couldn\u2019t believe he was rich. Did he do any outsourcing? Or is he hiding a dark secret within?No, before that.\u2018He seems to be a man greedy for power. Did such a man let his son in Knightdale as an enlisted man?\u2019No matter how low the rank. For a noble to become a private member of another nobleman, it was a shameful thing in many ways.And even to sweat allegiance Silkisia that much is\u2026 well.There would be many other ways. Did he have to do it this way?\u201cI have been isolated from my father for some reason.\u201dDid he read the doubt in her eyes? Aiden raised a low-pitched voice.\u201cNevertheless, I dared to reveal my last name because I wanted to tell you to trust me because I will tell you everything.\u201d\u201cTrust\u2026 you\u2026?\u201dWhat? Psychke asked herself with a bewildered feeling.\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to ask for at the Hall.\u201dOh, goodness. She was out of her mind that she had forgotten that. Pyschke raised her voice even sharper.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want you to go to the Temple of Destiny with me.\u201d(TN: Oho, and do what? Destiny, huh, so Verndia, what yah gonna do? Get rekt!)She thought that he\u2019d be saying more, and as she anticipated, he had closed his mouth and stayed still.Finally, Psychke, who was tired of waiting, asked a question.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cTo be honest\u2026 I would like to confirm something related to the Princess. It will not harm the princess in any way.\u201dPsychke stared silently into his red eyes, which were as calm as ocean.Then, vaguely realizing what kind of misunderstanding he was making. She lifted her lips to correct him.Maybe it\u2019s because she has shiny silver hair that he don\u2019t see often.It was often said by people who took pity on her when she was bullied by her family.\u201cI want to tell you that asking for a paternity test is useless. Lillian, the real princess, had showed up\u2026 and when I was merely adopted by the family, I had already been tested. I am not her father\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cI am not going to check that out.\u201dAiden flatly denied it.\u201cPrincess, if I tell you it now, you will not believe me. Even I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf only I had moved a little bit faster\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I have nothing to say but sorry.\u201dPsychke slowly closed her eyes and opened her eyes at the apology that was incomprehensible, filled with pity.Even if she gave him enough time, he didn\u2019t reveal what he was sorry about, so even if she asked, it was unlikely that he would answer.So, she asked something else.\u201cAren\u2019t you loyal to Silkisia?\u201d\u201cNo. I am not in any contract with your family.\u201dAiden answered immediately. His sincerity was reflected in his eyes that captured her.\u201cTo be precise, I came to Silkisia to see you, Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201d\u201cIf I tell you now, you won\u2019t believe me, and the story will be long, so I\u2019ll tell you the details later.\u201dShe seemed to be busy, but he added that he was sorry for wasting her time. Then he said in a hasty tone that he remembered something.\u201cI will probably get kicked out sooner or later. Maybe tomorrow, or maybe even right now.\u201d\u201cPardon? What do you mean-\u201d\u201cIt will happen. So, this will be the last conversation you had with the princess of Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 .\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again after a week\u2019s time. If my schedule changes, I\u2019ll inform you. Until then, shall you take care of yourself.\u201dShe then pushed him away and Aiden, who also had finished talking, bid to say his goodbye.Can I go on like this?Can I trust that man? Unorganized thoughts pestered her.But it\u2019s not going to be resolved just by hesitating, because the auction house\u2019s business was more urgent now.After nodding her head in agreement, she moved her heavy feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She then twirled the turquoise jewel three times to change her appearance.Her silver hair, which was reaching her waist had been shortened up to the nape of her neck. Her supposedly blue as sapphires eyes, were changed into a turquoise light like jewels.Apparently, because of it, her eyes and impression were changed likely a man.I used this magic because I don\u2019t want to be recognized as a woman. I had no idea I would use it this way though.Having finished her preparations, she headed straight to the auction house outside the capital.The three-story building belonged to the imperial family, but even though it was located on the outskirts of the palace, it was still luxurious.In order to open an illegal action on imperial property, one must put a loan.She looked at the back of the building, not the entrance, thinking that she had prepared enough.Then she approached the passerby man resting against the wall and whispered in secret.\u201cPeilas Astania.\u201dIt was honestly an entry code for this illegal auction found out by Lenox , while he was fixing the incident that happened in the past.She shrugged her shoulders to the man who glanced at her.Psychke was talking to him regardless.\u201cMay your breath dwell in the stars in the night sky.\u201d\u201cFrom a royal family?\u201dFrowning her brows, the guide asked her.It appeared that she has silver hair which represents Silkisia. And those who came here would have to change their appearances, therefore the guards will always check them.It is to check whether the one will buy is a middle-aged person, or an aristocrat who was money to actually buy the auction times later.Psychke looked up and raised her hand with her bracelet on. There was no family crest, but at a glance, the guide nodded at a bracelet that could only be worn by high-ranking nobles.\u201cThat way.\u201dHe pointed to a dead-end road.She followed what she had been instructed. Then, after seemingly a solid wall which was about to fall down, there revealed a hidden entrance space for the auction house.Psychke went inside.There was no one in the lobby, which was decorated with all kinds of jewels for the high-ranking nobles. It was just gloomy inside.It seemed that the auction had already begun, as a lot of time had passed with Yzhar and Aiden\u2019s affairs.\u2018Is the Duke already here?\u2019Psyckhe went down on the red carpeted underground stairs and traced Verndia\u2019s location through the engagement ring hidden under her leather gloves.He was in the same direction, near her.He appears to be moving in a dash, which she concluded that he has yet to find the necklace. He was rather sneaking, then looking for it publicly.\u2018You haven\u2019t found it yet.\u2019A man with good information lime him, could not have come without any countermeasures, and at least he would have brought a clue where the necklace was.She can go right to where he is, but she\u2019s in trouble if she run into him and blame her for his failure.She waited until Verndia sees the guards, before deciding to move.\u2018The position of the guards are\u2026\u2026\u2019The illegal auction house was reminiscent of a small Colosseum arena.As soon as Psychke entered, she checked the positions of the guards first.There were guards to the left and right doorways where customers come and go, and to the small entrance where the auction items will enter and exit.Judging by the aura she could feel, Verndia was keeping his eyes keen.Is it true that he sneaked in? Verndia\u2019s presence was being detected inside the auction house, where only officials could enter.She took a seat in the empty seat, paying attention to his actions one by one. There were few empty seats among the seats that can be occupied with a hundred of people.\u2018There are more people than I thought.\u2019She initially thought that there would be a few.Thinking so, Psychke glanced at the person sitting next to her.He was wearing somewhat like a mask, which covered his entire head, therefore, recognizing him a man or a woman in impossible.But the moment she looked at the knee of that person, she knew who he was.It was because of the pink fan that shone brightly as if it had been shredded with jewels.Psychke was momentarily speechless.\u2018\u2026Hilvia?\u2019Don\u2019t you think that fan represents you?It was crazy, but I thought it was a possibility.In a place like this, it is an unwritten rule to pretend that you do not know who the other person is, so no one would have been able to tell your identity too. Don\u2019t carry a fan next time.\u201cSo, now! Who will be the owner of this wonderful thing? Let\u2019s start with 300,000 gold!\u201dShe turned her head to the loud yell she heard suddenly.In the middle of the Colosseum.On the podium placed in the lowest place, the host wearing a funny hat was looking around exaggeratedly.Beside him, a bird whose feathers fluttered in rainbow colors as if released from paint was trapped in a cage.Psychke recognized at a glance that it was a rare animal smuggled from a distant country.\u201c300,000!\u201dThe person sitting opposite Psychke lifted the picket.Then, as if not to lose, Hilvia quickly raised a picket and shouted.\u201c400,000!\u201dThat bid was enough for ten commoners to have a one year\u2019s food.As she was about to stick her tongue inside her, someone else called for a higher amount.\u201c500,000!\u201dAfter several fights, the bird was sold to Hilvia for 1 million gold.\u201c- This product starts from 500,000 gold!\u201dThen came to her sight was the Blue Diamond. A bouquet of flowers made of jewels.All those luxurious and splendid items were sold to Hilvia.\u2018Goodness. What in the world?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in the middle of killing her time, anxious about Verndia, who was eagerly wandering inside the auction house.\u201cYou have been waiting a long time, everyone. Finally, today\u2019s highlight!\u201d\u2018\u2026 I don\u2019t think it was because he couldn\u2019t find the necklace that caused his failure to steal.\u2019She hadn\u2019t thought about it for a while.I was starting to get worried about the tone of the MC suggesting it was the last product that\u2019s to be auctioned.Since necklaces have not been produced before, the highlight must have been a poison needle necklace.\u201cI\u2019m sure all of you have heard about this one. Reas, the great evil girl, and the necklace of Keitan that she made.\u201dBefore showing the necklace, the moderator briefly explained Reas\u2019 evil deeds.20 years ago from now.A lady named Reas presented Keitan\u2019s necklace, the poison sting necklace, to the current Empress and to the Crown Princess.Fortunately, it was discovered that it had a poison sting before hanging it around her neck, hence the Crown Princess was unharmed.This incident caused a great disaster.The House of Reas was destroyed instantly when she dared to assassinate the Crown Princess.The nobles associated with the family were demoted to their titles or worse, lost their lives.Two years after that.The Crown Prince, who eventually became the emperor, albeit guilty of his great crimes, issued a descent to revive her family name, as she was an important family in the history of the empire.Some of the bewildered aristocrats raised their opinions, but they were buried.The emperor inquired about their secretive ways of living in hiding. And among them, he chose a man who was quick-witted and excellent in worldly wisdom to succeed Reas\u2019 family.\u201cHis Majesty, the Emperor, is truly a great man. Isn\u2019t he?\u201dThe moderator trembled, saying that even if they were sentenced to erasure of records, they should appreciate reviving the family that was supposed not to be revived.Seems like everyone was thinking the same thing, but here and there, there were words of agreement.But Psychke felt her head throbbed from them.\u2018It\u2019s strange.\u2019The attempt to assassinate the royal family was a felony.To the extent that there was nothing to say even if he destroyed his family and killed all of his collaterals.But he decided to revive the family that caused such an incident?\u2018What kind of family is that?\u2019Even though I am familiar with the history books of the empire, I thought it was the first time I had ever heard of it. What kind of family was that the emperor had to cover them up that should have been remained as a scandal?It was around the time when she was lost in her thoughts, weighing the families of the empire one by one.\u201cDamn it. If he wants to die, she should die beautifully. Why is she dragging others around?\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201dHer head turned white at the swearing towards Reas heard from the other side.Hilvia was never this angry to her even when she was publicly insulting her. It was bizarre.Tendons grew in her hands as they gripped the handle of her chair. Psychke glared at Hilvia with hatred and curiosity in her eyes.\u201cWhy, why \u2026..?\u201dHilvia froze because she so surprised to the extent that even a knight could also not stand properly.It was at that time when she was holding back what she wanted to take out a dagger from her arms and clenched her teeth.Bang!A roar erupted from the entrance behind the presenter, from the inside where the auction items were to be located.Psychke, who was awakened by the sound, turned to look.\u201cWh- what is this?\u201dA few aristocrats got up and looked around after a series of noises. They looked worried that they might have been attacked by the imperial family.Psyckhe quickly pinpointed Verndia\u2019s location.He was moving quickly, but not beyond a certain radius seemed to have found the location of the necklace.The guards guarding the entrance where the auction items went in and out were nowhere to be seen.Half of the guards guarding the guest entrance were also running towards the inside.\u201cCalm down, calm down, folks! It looks like the workers moving the box blew up the magic tool inside!\u201dThe moderator, who raised his voice with magic, tried to calm the confused nobles.Bang, bang!However, the unstoppable roar intensified the commotion.Taking advantage of the gap, Psyche ran past the nobles who were blocking the passage. He jumped down from the blind spot of the host.When a customer broke in, the guards tried to stop her.Avoiding it by lightly twitching, she entered the prohibited area except for the officials.\u201cDamn, what are these bastards doing?\u201d\u201cBefore you come this way, you need to pack your stuff- wait a minute, sir! This is a no-entry zone!\u201dIn the midst of her uproar, as soon as the guards found her, they rushed to her without a hitch.She didn\u2019t have a sword, so they didn\u2019t seem to think that she was a second intruder.Psychke ran after them without difficulty and ran towards Verndia.\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s endless.\u201dAnd in a small room, he encountered her fianc\u00e9, who was annoyingly dealing with guards, guard\u2019 dogs, and beasts.With a dagger, Psychke raided one of the guards behind her and took the sword from him.Then she exchanged it for a dagger and skillfully began to slash her enemies.In a surprise attack from his back, which he thought was safe, the guards collapsed.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSurprised by the help of a stranger, Verndia stopped moving.Then, he remembered his fianc\u00e9e, who had her silver hair, who strangely had the same hair color with the man in front of him, and no words came out.No way.Thinking so, he checked the location of his fianc\u00e9e. And he put on a look of embarrassment afterwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her silver hair, which was then reflected from the blade was followed after the screams and blood traces of the enemies.Repelling her flying attack, Verndia moved diligently, but couldn\u2019t take his eyes off his fianc\u00e9e.No frills action.A movement that is as smooth and powerful as water.It was so accurate to the extent that any vital point can\u2019t be missed, and her speed was too good to have his eyes follow it.That wasn\u2019t something that could be achieved just by practicing for a day or two.Even a talented person can barely master it after at least a few years of practicing.It wasn\u2019t something one can pull off so natural and effortlessly.As its name suggests, Psyche with a sword was like a butterfly.She look delicate and graceful, and her swordsmanship that seemed to be easily evaded, but was absolutely unavoidable was something \u2013She appeared seemingly fragile, but she honestly looked like she was flapping her wings like of that a butterfly, that no one dare to provoke her swift storm-like movements.\u2018That can\u2019t be true.\u2019He realized why the princess in Silkisia was displeased to hold a sword.Psychke was a genius.He couldn\u2019t dare compare Psychke\u2019s skills to Yzhar.She must have wanted to hide it badly, knowing that she was a child who has a father that doesn\u2019t love her, and that she was someone who had surpassed her foster siblings\u2019 skills.Even if her existence could restore the fame of Sikisia, who is now famous for their swordsmanship.Not a short time passed. Finally, Psyckhe, who had cut off the last guard, opened her mouth.\u201cDid you find the necklace?\u201dAfter hiding her identity, Verndia also changed his appearance with his magic.The engagement ring, which could identify each other\u2019s location, made it clear that the other person was his fianc\u00e9e.Since she was seemingly unscathed, he didn\u2019t ask how she was, but found her necklace.\u201cIt was a trap.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to be found out that he looked at her as if possessed while she was battling with the guards.As the blood dripped from her sword, Verndia responded as bluntly as possible.\u201cAs soon as I touched it, it became like this. It wasn\u2019t even the real one.\u201dHe rolled up the forearm that didn\u2019t hold her sword. He rolled up his forearm without a sword. Something like a bloodline wriggling as if it were alive tied his palm, the back of his hand, and his forearm like a spider web. His blood hints that were shaped as if spider\u2019s web were covering his palms, hands and his forearms.Psychke groaned at the disgusting and terrifying appearance that she could not even express.\u201c\u2026 Are\u2026 you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat if I am not?\u201dVerndia answered bluntly. It was because she decided that there was no need to publicize the excruciating pain from them.\u201cIt is a curse placed on this fake thing. It gets stronger the more you get impacted or move with it. That\u2019s why they had to release it in the first place.\u201dFrom the beginning, Keitan\u2019s necklace was not here.The false information that the original will come out seems to be a trap for those who track the incident involving the necklace, Verndia explained.\u201cIf the auction had gone on, I would have used any excuse to cancel it. They can\u2019t sell something they don\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cThen why did you tell me to steal the necklace instead of winning the bid-\u201d\u201cIt must have meant to come and see if it was a trap or not.\u201dAlthough she admits that she has been rolled like a piece of paper to be thrown away, she doesn\u2019t seem too offended by Verndia.Was this also affected with the subtle relationship between them? Pyschke tilted her head to the side.\u201cThen the success of this quest is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou just have to tell the truth and show that it\u2019s fake.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much time for long conversations, so Verndia pointed towards the door.The barking of dogs, the cries from the maids, and shouts from afar were quite close to them.\u201cEven so, I didn\u2019t know you could mobilize even a magical beast.\u201dHe sharpened his teeth for even using forbidden magic.As I thought, I wanted to set off a spark and burn the auction house or something.However, it was under a curse, and it was difficult to move hastily. If he exposes his purple fire and people find out that he is the Duke of Lestir, they will get into trouble. He killed his temper recklessly.\u201cCome this way.\u201dHe led his fianc\u00e9e into a secret passage he used to infiltrate.Psychke followed him and unlocked the bracelet\u2019s appearance-changing magic.Because there was only a time limit due to the lacking amount of mana contained in the bracelet. When there is no need to hide from others, she could spare the remaining.Thump. Thump.The sound of two hastily footsteps harmonized in the empty hallway.Verndia, who was walking ahead, glanced behind him with his eyes squinted.Every time she moved; he could see her silver hair tied together, rustling.To tell the truth, even if Psychke didn\u2019t come, he was able to get out of the situation a little while ago.However, if he did, the curse would have spread and he would suffer internal injuries, so he was thinking about what to do with the scar.He received her reinforcement earlier and he couldn\u2019t thank her enough.Verndia was a person meticulous in public and private affairs, and he was the type of person to pay back double what he received.In return, he promised to send her a dress for the prince\u2019s coming-of-age banquet.\u201cLet\u2019s do some sparring later.\u201dIt was a sudden request to have a match, but Psychke understood the meaning.It was surprising and embarrassing, but at the thought of being recognized as someone good at swords, a bubble-like lump sprang from my heart.That was Verndia\u2019s way of complimenting someone.As the only sword master in the empire and the strongest swordsman, he would always teach someone through a sparring.However, he never accepted it on the excuse that he was busy or that he could get hurt because he couldn\u2019t control his strength.Well, in the end, Isolet would just turn it down in a pleasant way.If she was to express it in Verndia\u2019s unique way of speaking, he would reply, \u2018Are you going to mix swords with me with that kind of skill? Have you gone crazy?\u2019. His own kind of praising someone is enough.\u201cYes\u2026 Thank you.\u201dShe was so happy that he was recognized by others, and her expressionless face had a young blush.And Verndia, who had been spying on her, was startled by her and almost stopped her from walking. Blue eyes that fell faintly.Long fluttering eyelashes. A mouth that draws a light arc, red cheeks, and a small fist gently raised above his chest.The sincere expression shown on her face for the first time by someone who was always trembling or expressionless while always looking at her, and the pure joy that he felt faintly through the engagement ring\u2026\u2018Cute\u2026 wait, this is\u2026 Crazy.\u2019What the hell are you thinking now? I couldn\u2019t believe I thought of those words while looking at her princess. Verndia shook his head like a madman.(TN: Our Verndia has fallen in love\u2014ooopsss.)Then, suddenly, he raised his eyebrows and pushed her back.\u201cCareful \u2013 ugh\u201dHe was hit by the mercenary\u2019s charge from the next room. Verndia was thrown into the opposite room by the force.Bang! The wooden door slammed into his back.\u201c\u2013!\u201dShe reflexively called him the Duke, but had to swallow it.Psychke hastily turned the jewel on her bracelet to hide her true form. With her sword in front of her, she stopped the mercenaries who were trying to attack Verndia.\u201cI heard there was only one rat.\u201dThe mercenary, who found her belatedly, scoffed at her.Her delicate appearance made him look down on her because she was about one head smaller than him.However, he wrinkled his face as he struck the fiercely flying sword.\u201cWhat, is this\u2026?\u201dAs she fell behind her for a moment, the mercenary counterattacked, wiping her frigid wrist.Psychke easily blocked him.Judging how strong he was from the sword; it was definitely different from what she had dealt with the guards before.Still, in her pure ability, she was ahead than him.The problem was that Psychke had little practical experience.\u201cNow looking at it, you have such a nice appearance, like a water lily?\u201dFor the mercenaries who crossed over life and death, the constant swordsmanship was easy to deal with.The man, who caught the pattern of her way of fighting, exchanging several packs, blocked all attacks with his body\u2019s survival instinct. Even though he can\u2019t keep up with his eyes.He giggled and laughed, attacking her unannounced.She pretended to fall back, then stomped her foot and slammed it in front of him.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe slapped her, but she couldn\u2019t stop the blood from pouring down from her cheek.Without even thinking of wiping the dripping hot liquid, she blocked the attack from one after another.After a few minutes passed, Verndia showed no sign of coming. Psychke glanced behind her back.\u2018Did he faint?\u2019The slowly growing wounds stung. The robe he was wearing was also torn here and there, and it was almost impossible to see the clothes he was really wearing.Step by step, blocking anomalous attacks, she was clearly growing tired in real time.But now, she was not practicing, but fighting, and getting out of this place was more important than being tired. Before the guards whom she barely escaped from show up.Verndia had no other choice.He awakened his mana and put it on his sword. While being careful that the other party won\u2019t see his tricks.As he concentrated on doing so, he could feel his cursed power wriggling with all his might.\u2018I have to finish this quickly.\u2019He clenched his teeth and the air around him was getting colder too.This kind of change is an opportunity because most people don\u2019t notice it.He had to knock this down quickly, as the surroundings would gradually freeze over time.Whereas Psychke began to stamp out the differences in her experience with her skills. Frightened by the fierce attack, the mercenaries risked their lives to fight her.A fierce battle with no compromises.So, the two, focused on fighting, didn\u2019t notice Verndia at all.At some point, Verndia, who appeared with one arm in his hand, preventing the curse from spreading anymore, was uncharacteristically hardened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though he can\u2019t keep up with his eyes.He giggled and laughed, attacking her unannounced.She pretended to fall back, then stomped her foot and slammed it in front of him.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe slapped her, but she couldn\u2019t stop the blood from pouring down from her cheek.Without even thinking of wiping the dripping hot liquid, she blocked the attack from one after another.After a few minutes passed, Verndia showed no sign of coming. Psychke glanced behind her back.\u2018Did he faint?\u2019The slowly growing wounds stung. The robe he was wearing was also torn here and there, and it was almost impossible to see the clothes he was really wearing.Step by step, blocking anomalous attacks, she was clearly growing tired in real time.But now, she was not practicing, but fighting, and getting out of this place was more important than being tired. Before the guards whom she barely escaped from show up.Verndia had no other choice.He awakened his mana and put it on his sword. While being careful that the other party won\u2019t see his tricks.As he concentrated on doing so, he could feel his cursed power wriggling with all his might.\u2018I have to finish this quickly.\u2019He clenched his teeth and the air around him was getting colder too.This kind of change is an opportunity because most people don\u2019t notice it.He had to knock this down quickly, as the surroundings would gradually freeze over time.Whereas Psychke began to stamp out the differences in her experience with her skills. Frightened by the fierce attack, the mercenaries risked their lives to fight her.A fierce battle with no compromises.So, the two, focused on fighting, didn\u2019t notice Verndia at all.At some point, Verndia, who appeared with one arm in his hand, preventing the curse from spreading anymore, was uncharacteristically hardened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFakes don\u2019t want to be real~ 22 ~\u201cThat child has nothing to do with me.\u201dThe usual little girl with her pink ponytail standing out, where nowhere in sight.Instead of a child, there stood a middle-aged sorcerer with her green eyes, brilliant blonde hair, reaching to her shoulders.As if her face was melted because of fire, her face was horribly burnt.Returning to her real form, she had a poisonous aura that anyone wouldn\u2019t breathe easily around her.But, Verndia didn\u2019t care about such.\u201cThen, back then why-\u201d\u201cI was merely curious. That\u2019s all in it.\u201dTherefore, he better shut his mouth if he still wants to live.Lia gave a cold warning through unsaid words.If it was different time, he could have put her in a tight corner.Verndia noticed. If he still provoked her more than he did, he would need to fight with her whether life or death.So, he didn\u2019t say the words stuck in his throat.And because he had something to ponder about, he sent Isolet off, telling him not to touch her (Pyschke), and walked on the street alone.He had been swearing at him since dawn, but it paid off. Verndia got the answer he wanted.The ability that only Silkisia has, not melting ice.And a fake princess that has the power on top of that, Psychke.And Lia\u2019s liking for her and the hostility he just saw.The scattered puzzles were put together to create a picture.The haphazard evidence gathered together to draw a clear conclusion for him.\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201dVerndia slowly organized his thoughts, covering his eyes with his hand. The truth he had just unraveled was just ridiculous.Psychke Silkisia was no such thing as a fake princess.She was the real one no one could have thought of.* * *Around the time when Verndia met up with Lia.Psychke was having a nightmare.\u201cIt\u2019s cold\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u2026\u201dShe had become a child and was lying flat in a dark prison in her dream.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming\u2026 Is it because of the curse\u2026. Did he run away\u2026?She didn\u2019t have the energy to cry.Her face was already in a mess, covered with her own tears. The young Psychke touched her starving stomach and bent over.The chains cluttered. The chains tied to her hands and feet made an unpleasant noise.She was unable to move properly, and all she could do as a child was to run away in her dreams.Even though everything didn\u2019t go her way.I genuinely hope that you have a good dream today. And the young Psychke closed her eyes afterwards.And she opened her eyes in reality.\u201cI think she\u2019s going to wake up!\u201d\u201cAre you awake?\u201dShe lifted her eyelids that felt heavier than a lump of lead.The first thing she saw were unfamiliar people in maid clothes, and the second thing she saw was an unfamiliar pattern on the ceiling.\u201cWhat about the Duke?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here, Miss.\u201dEchoing voices from afar haunted her eardrums. She felt chill and cold sweats poured from her forehead like rain.\u2018Where am I?\u2019Her eyes clouded like a mist. Remnants of her nightmare remained, and her head was dizzy.Her whole body was heavy, as if buried in the dirt. Psychke closed her eyes slowly to restore her view and repeated the same.\u201cBring Sir Isolet!\u201dIsolet.The direct assistant to the Duke of Verndia.As the incomprehensible words were lined up, a familiar word was heard for the first time.It acted as a catalyst, and her consciousness that had been fragmented like fragments stuck together one by one. A light came on in her darkened soul.Therefore, Isolet hurriedly opened the door to the room where she was,\u201cSir Aide?\u201dPsychke succeeded in calling him with her dry lips.Whether she was crying or smiling at him.With a strange expression on her face, Isolet approached her. When he appeared, the maids in the room remained silent and moved away.\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the estate of Duke Lestir.\u201dThe accident turned slowly.His words didn\u2019t make sense, so Psychke blinked with a hazy face.Then, after Isolet reminded me one more time with a nervous expression, \u2018It\u2019s Duke of Lestir.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026.Pardon?\u201dShe sounded shock. She desperately wanted to get up instantly, but her deflated energy didn\u2019t let her.\u201cI, Princess. Should I asked you a question after you woke up, please forgive me.\u201dIn a tone of longing for something from her, Isolet grabbed her hands tightly like a praying person.\u201cHave you suffered any harm from our Duke?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dPsychke repeated the same thing like a fool. It was simply because she didn\u2019t understand Isolet\u2019s question.\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201dIt was hard to pinpoint what to say, so Isolet was weeping.It was then that a voice like frost pierced her ears.\u201cI guess, I must have been an untrustworthy in your eyes, Princess.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dIsolet, who was caught at the scene, made a suffocating sound.Verndia suddenly appeared in her doorstep with his ruffled hair, wild face which looked annoying as ever with everything he does.Even though he beckoned to leave, Isolet only glanced at him and did not intend to leave.As Psychke stared at Isolet, wondering why the hell he was doing that, Verndia sighed and pressed his hands to his temples.(TN: At least Isolet is kind enough to be considerate to her\u2026)\u201cLet the princess talk. Did I do something weird yesterday?\u201d\u201cSomething weird?\u201d\u201cWhy did you arrive last night late?\u201dLast night, Verndia, who escaped from the auction house, returned with the unconscious Psychke at dawn.Isolet was surprised to see them in a mess as they walked in. It was only natural for Isolet, who didn\u2019t know the whole situation, to be worried at them.Verndia mumbled softly.\u201cI just took a walk until late because the night breeze was good.\u201dAh, she guessed that he has already said the same way. Psychke adjusted her voice.\u201cRight. I took a walk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Is that really all? The Duke didn\u2019t threaten you?\u201dIf the princess changes her words after returning to Silksia, there would be a problem between the families.Isolet did not readily believe.\u201cYes, he never did.\u201d\u201c\u2026. All right.\u201dBut Psychke\u2019s expression was also serious, and the duke was glaring at him with a fierce look, so he reluctantly left the room.\u201cAre you all right?\u201dShe was looking at the assistant walking around helplessly, whistling, and Verndia asked as if tossing his question nonchalantly. He was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.\u201cDo you know how surprised I was when you suddenly fell on the ground?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel good.\u201dShe\u2019d say she\u2019s fine if she was. But she was really feeling unwell.Her eyes were dizzy, her limbs twitched, and her stomach rumbled.\u201cWhy did you fall? Do you have any chronic diseases?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dShe could not tell the truth that she collapsed while trying to suppress her ability to run uncontrollable.Psychke avoided his gaze and bit her lips.\u2018Why?\u2019It wasn\u2019t the first time she had used mana to use her sword, but it was the first time she had fluctuated like this, so it was confusing.\u2018I\u2019m glad I managed to stop it somehow.\u2019She was worried that it would remain like this. She strained her hands under the blanket strength.Verndia was immersed in his own thoughts just as she was.\u2018It\u2019s a disease. Maybe her body was born weak.\u2019It\u2019s because the most talented people in history usually have excellent stamina. He wondered if she had chronic disease.He didn\u2019t ask further because the look on her face was implying that she didn\u2019t want to reveal what kind of disease she has.Verndia rolled her curtains to her window. The warm afternoon sun poured into the room.\u201cI think it was darkened on purpose to get a good night\u2019s sleep. The body needs to be in a bright place though\u2026. What are you doing?\u201dPsychke, who stood up with a grin, answered him.\u201cI have to go.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo Silkisia.\u201dBecause it was dark in her room, it was a failure to hear Vendia words \u2018It\u2019s already late.He thought it was night, but it was day. Even the sun goes down there!She told Aiden that she\u2019d be back. Is he still there?No, he won\u2019t be. \u2018Cause it\u2019s been almost a day.If so, did he go back to Silkisia alone? He lost the princess he had to escort?\u201cI have already sent a letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThough he had taken care to justify her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s stay, Psychke\u2019s complexion grew paler.It was no different from what the Duke himself admitted that Aiden had not been escorting her diligently.\u201cPlease lend me a carriage.\u201d\u201cPrincess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright if you can\u2019t do so. I can just go out and call a carriage.\u201dAiden would have been punished, but in order to avoid that, she must not delay anymore.She got up with her luggage on the bedside table. But she couldn\u2019t even take three steps, and her legs lost strength and she stumbled.\u201cPlease rest a little more-\u201d\u201cYou can go back and rest. I have an urgent business to go back.\u201dShe spoke well, so she was reckless even if she went to rest. After that, Verndia exhaled briefly.He has grown to like Psychke without realizing it.Regardless of whether he was good or bad, he was very reluctant to see that a person with a weak body moved.It was even more so because he was the one who provided the cause.He thought that Psychke\u2019s fight with the mercenaries was the problem, and she\u2019d be fine if he had just joined quickly. But it was not polite to keep holding on to someone who said she was going home.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe supported Psychke with an unwilling face.* * *She could have just rented a carriage.What did I do to have us ride together in this carriage?Psychke pretended to be looking out his window and glanced across from him.She was so sick that he wanted to close her eyes. But she couldn\u2019t do that because of the other person\u2019s presence. She was very uncomfortable, as if she was sitting on a cushion of thorns.Whether he know her feelings or not.Verndia, who looked out the window with his chin on his palm, was always indifferent. From immediately after his departure until now, he did not open his mouth.This stillness was uncomfortable.Psychke leaned her head against his window and let out a small sigh.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to sleep?\u201dAt that breath, Verndia opened his mouth.He had a lot of things he wanted to ask, but he was already tired, so it was because he was taking care of her.It was useless because she didn\u2019t rest well enough.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s talk for a moment.\u201dVerndia, leaning forward, sensually crossed his legs.He tilted her head crookedly, pressed his chin, and fixed his dazzling purple eyes like a dangerous beast. Then, even if he stands still, he emits light and merges with his appearance, and if other young ladies saw him, his posture should be left as a picture. The decadent appearance was completed.But instead of Psychke admiring him, she tensed her back straightened it. Then she bent over, groaning due to the pain in her chest.He looked at her openly. Her reaction that returned to him was disastrous.Verndia grinned at her.\u201cAm I so uncomfortable, Princess?\u201d\u201cUn\u2026 comfortable?\u201dWhy is he asking such an obvious question?Psychke replied at him shakily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs a response to that, Verndia stopped laughing, and instead tapped the handle of the chair, thinking about something. His gaze was directly towards the floor.\u201c\u2026 Do you still have no feelings for me?\u201dThe tone was lightly thrown in a passing manner, but the air inside the carriage became heavy instantly.Psychke replaced her supposed answer by avoiding his eyes.\u2018I think the same thing about breaking up the marriage.\u2019He wanted to keep an eye on her since he found out her identity.However, rather than watching, she looks like she would break up their marriage as soon as she has time.His head throbbed. Verndia put a stiffened expression and brushed the banges above his forehead.\u2018If only he hadn\u2019t written that contract.\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe how everything seemed to end easily using verbal, and even wrote a contract for her. It was his first time feeling dissatisfied about his judgement.Those who regret the past cannot be undone. He frowned through his nervousness and asked calmly.\u201cWhat is the fundamental reason for taking the ring off?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know why are you asking such a thing.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s call it a personal interest.\u201dInterest? How ridiculous.She looked at him, seeing through his obvious lie. Why is he asking such things in an area where there\u2019s no people?The shy Verndia coughed in vain.\u201cI have a job to do relating to auction house, so if I can help, I want to help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something the Duke can help me with. You took care of me when I fainted, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say anything because of her bored tone.While Verndia was internally ill, the chariot arrived at the house Duke of Silkisia.\u201cThank you for taking care of me. I shall take my leave.\u201dVerndia stopped Psychke, who was about to leave without hesitation. She told him that she\u2019s fine going alone, but he got off first and escorted her.\u201cAh, hey!\u201dIs he a horseman?Lenox, who was putting his horse into the stable, shouted and pretended to know her. He ran towards her with a whip for horse, and blinded his eyes just by looking at her.\u201cAre you crazy? Have you gone insane?\u201dThe mad Lenox didn\u2019t even see the Duke and kept his informal words.He shook Psychke\u2019s shoulder with a rough hand gesture.\u201cWho wants to stay overnight in a man\u2019s house again?\u201d\u201cLet go of me.\u201d\u201cDo you know how angry father was? Why, you became nervous after seeing Lillian? Do you like chasing after men for fear of being abandoned by your family?\u201d\u201cI said let go!\u201dShe was already dizzy because she has yet to fully recover and became even dizzier when Lenox shook her back and forth. She suppressed her nauseousness and tried to lower Lenox\u2019s arm.However, she had someone who moved faster than her.\u201cI really don\u2019t know why my father did that to a thing like you. If you were just thrown on the streets as useless you are\u2026. Aaaaaah!!\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re talking too harshly.\u201dVerndia, who crumpled his face fiercely, grabbed Lenox\u2019s wrist.So far, Verndia only saw Yzhar educating Psychke from going out.It was the first time Verndia had seen Lenox nagging Psychke.And he wondered what all these crazy people are.Verndia didn\u2019t give much strength to his grasp. Lenox grabbed his wrist and was in so much pain that his face turned red.\u201cPlease, let go, let go! Aaackk!\u201d\u201cLet it go, Duke!\u201dShocked Psychke exclaimed at him. Not because ahe was worried about Lenox, but because she was afraid that the Duke of Silkisia or Yzhar would jump out at Lenox\u2019s weeping scream.Not knowing what happened to Aiden, there was nothing good about hurting anyone.Verndia didn\u2019t budge despite Lenox\u2019s struggles, and he threw what he was holding as if he was dirty trash.Then he supported Psychke, who was staggering with his arms.Lenox grabbed the neck of his swollen, red, hand and cried out for his neck to burst.\u201cI will tell my father!\u201d\u201cI should be the one telling you this. Did the Duke of Silkisia educate you to treat s sick person like this?\u201cSick, you mean? Who is sick?\u201dLenox snickered, as if saying \u2018Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u2019\u201cI think that she has done that to you only once or twice, but I\u2019m sorry to say but she\u2019s someone who desperately asks for attention of us. And someone who fools everyone around\u2014\u201d\u201cYou mean, a doctor can fake an sickness?\u201d\u201cWhat are you calling the doctor for? I am sure she had faked her sickness?\u201d\u201cAre you going to rest in a place like this, Princess?\u201dLenox couldn\u2019t reply back as he was left behind and Verndia asked Psychke with a frown.Psychke was about to reply, but Lenox interrupted while wheezing.\u201cIt would be better for the Duke to come to his senses as well!\u201d\u201cAre you ordering me now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an order, it\u2019s a reminder. She says that whenever she wanted attention. How many times have I seen that?\u201d\u201cI am neither the head of the household nor the heir, but I don\u2019t think the interest of the second son would be that much worthwhile.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dLenox\u2019s ears burned red with embarrassment and anger.Verndia laughed at the second son.\u201cYou are overly self-conscious, Duke.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of fuss is this?\u201dA low voice cut through the overheated air.Lenox, who turned his head in the direction of the sound, called out to him in a whimper.\u201cOlder brother!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the Duke of Lestir?\u201dEven in the warm spring weather in a wrinkle-free dress, Yzhar slowly approached them with his clothes buttoned up to his neck.As usual, he was creating an atmosphere that choked others.The man who came close only stared at Psychke and Verndia with his cold, black eyes. He didn\u2019t even give a glance to his brother, who was happy to see him.But Lenox sprinted away as if he had met the savior and hid behind him. It was a bonus that he whined that he had put his wrist out.\u201cKuegh.\u201d(TN: Lenox is a crybaby goodness!)An act not commensurate with his age and stature caused Verndia to burst into laughter.It seemed that it had scratched Yzhar\u2019s heart.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the Duke was such a rogue.\u201d(TN: If Verndia is a rogue, then you must be trash.)\u201cA rogue, thank you for the compliment. That\u2019s much better than being the crazy dog of the north.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It would had been better if you returned home directly after you finished your work.\u201dHe spoke coldly and grabbed Psychke\u2019s hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Father is waiting for you.\u201d\u201cHow about Aiden?\u201dIf he asked her how he knew about Aiden, she\u2019d say that it was only because of her gut.Psychke understood what it implies.If she follows him inside, she will never have the chance to go out ever again. Even if she had chances to go out, she\u2019d be surrounded by guards.\u201cCome in and talk.\u201d\u201cNo, talk here.\u201dShe had to run away. If he was in a good state, he wouldn\u2019t know their plan, it was difficult to even hold the sword now. That was the reason why she only now sensed the presence of the enlisted men in the mansion.But she had to figure out what happened to Aiden, and what he did after she ran away.He didn\u2019t talk much, nor was he friendly to her.It was thanks to him that she was able to go to the auction house, and he had to pay for it.\u201cGet in.\u201dThere\u2019d be eyes seeing them.Saying that, Yzhar glanced at Verndia.He meant that he didn\u2019t want anyone else to know about the family, but Psychke vehemently shook her hand away.\u201cI said talk here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go in until you tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026When are you going to leave, Duke?\u201d\u201cAhh, I was going to watch. It looks fun.\u201dWith his amethyst-like eyes twinkling, Verndia smiled.Yzahr expressed his displeasure at the fact that he had no intention of going until the conversation was over.\u201cIt\u2019s Silkisia\u2019s business, so you\u2019d better not listen, Duke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also the job of a lovely fianc\u00e9.\u201d\u201cShe is the Princess of Silkisia even before she became the Duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re getting annoying, so don\u2019t turn around and tell me. Are you saying that I am not listening to you?\u201dVerndia sneered.\u201cPrincess, who is Aiden?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an enlisted soldier who escorted me yesterday.\u201d\u201cEnlisted, enlisted soldier.\u201dHe patted his chin and pretended to think.\u201cFor a soldier\u2019s work to be just as important enough to be labeled as a family affair, is that it\u2026 princess?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cThen, how can a private business become a family business? It seems that Silkisia was not a family that cared for the private soldiers to that extent.\u201dUnable to even refute because it was true, Yzhar distorted his brow.\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s ignoring me, the princess\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, to the point where I can\u2019t hear such trivial things together.\u201dAs a duke, Verndia bit the bullseye with a natural and calm expression.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it wouldn\u2019t be good for the Duke either.\u201dYzar, who had barely suppressed his anger, woke up to reality. He was warning him not to intervene any further if he wanted to receive support from the Knights Templar.\u201cIt\u2019d no good to you if you keep being like this, Duke.\u201dVerndia only acted skillfully, but did not back down.He actually heard about how to deal with higher-level monsters through Psychke, so the support of the Imperial Knights was not disappointing.\u201cHaa \u2026.\u201dHad it not been for the Duke of Lestir, she would have been dragged in by force. He couldn\u2019t even imagine what kind of rumors he would spread in the social world.He had no choice but to be composed under such circumstances.The black eyes of the man who let out a long breath turned towards Psychke.\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to be kicked out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHe\u2019s been told he might be kicked out.Which is today.It must also be because of her.Shocked, Psychke momentarily lost her balance. The body, which had never been good, rapidly deteriorated, and the body that had been warm at least slightly began to turn cold like ice.However, Yzhar didn\u2019t show any change in his facial expression.\u201cNo matter how talented you are, there is no need for an enlisted soldier who doesn\u2019t listen to his master.\u201d\u201cStop struggling. Father is waiting for you.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he turned his back. Lenox waved his fist as if to go in and listen to Yzhar.Psychke clenched her teeth.\u201cNo.\u201dThe sounds of stepping on the neatly manicured stone road leading to the mansion\u2019s gate stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why do I have to go in?\u201d\u201cPsychke.\u201d\u201cThe real Princess, Lillian, is also back, right? Even my engagement with Duke Lestir will disappear once the monsters in the north was defeated. There\u2019s no reason for me to shackled here.\u201dAt the words of treating herself as a tool, Verndia\u2019s expression became strange.Since she was unable to see his face, she continued to bring up those words which had been locked up in the very depth of her heart.\u201cSince you have raised me during this time, I will do my best to live. But I will no longer be here.\u201d\u201cPsyche Silkisia!\u201d\u201cI plan to stay somewhere else until all the monsters were all killed in the Duchy of Lestir. Therefore, I advise you to be low-key and don\u2019t ever dare order soldiers to look for me, if you don\u2019t want me to reveal this.\u201d\u201cDo you think things will go as you like?\u201dWith his fuming anger, Yzhar stretched his hand, intending to take her with more force this time around.He knew that her power was far superior than him, but she look so pale and she was sweating coldly, so he thought he could take her with force.However, the attempt was thwarted by Verndia\u2019s strong hand.\u201cDuke!\u201d\u201cI think the discussion is already over.\u201dVerndia tilted his head as if he was eagerly curious.(TN: These two, this couple would have been a powerful one if they are in love. Just when will there be love between them? Oh, please, I\u2019m craving such romantic scenes~!)\u201cShe\u2019s not even a child, but an adult. So what\u2019s the problem for her to want going out?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for the Duke to care!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s business, so I have to clean this.\u201d\u201cSince when did you ever care about her so much?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t take care of her too much, which is more than why I will take care of her from now onwards.\u201d(TN: I made sure that the TL of this part is sweet~)Psychke, who had been caught in the midst of the men fighting, turned her head.Verndia chuckled at his puzzled face, wondering what he was hearing now.\u201cBy the way, Duke. Silkisia seems to have a very unique custom.\u201dHe jokingly stopped Yzhar from taking Psychke\u2019s hand, and he said playfully.\u201cOr there are many things to keep inside the mansion?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe entrance and every floor are guarded by private soldiers. I was amazed at how great your discipline is.\u201dThere was no way Verndia could not feel what Psychke felt too.He was quick to notice. I don\u2019t know how her situation is going, but I know you shouldn\u2019t let her go like this. He doesn\u2019t know about her situation, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t let her go like this. If this was the case from the very beginning, he wouldn\u2019t be able to meet her easily in the future.He was going to tell her that the mansion is a place which the safety is questionable. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t.\u2018He knows.\u2019So, in order to strike him back, she gently scratched Yzhar\u2019s heart. Even the resentment she had endured because of his support for the Imperial Knights was mixed to her heart\u2019s content.\u201c\u2026 \u201dYzhar, who ruined his father\u2019s plan, licked his lips.he thought Psychke could be deceived if he hid her pretense as much as possible. But the person accompanying her was the Duke of Lestir.He covered things like that, but everything seemed to be revealed at once.\u201cLet\u2019s go, princess.\u201dFinally, Verndia, who won the quarrel, smiled refreshingly and pushed her fianc\u00e9e into her arms.It was in the direction of Silkisia\u2019s mansion, not in the direction of Lestir\u2019s carriage.When she asked him with her eyes what he was doing, he answered with his face cleared of the old congestion.\u201cYou have to pack your bags.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCome to think of it, she had only thought of going out of this hellish place and had forgotten all the important things.Relics that were hidden in drawers and collected one after another whenever money was made.She must stay in an inn or anywhere safe. Her physical condition was so bad that she didn\u2019t have the courage that she could go out or in easily, so she did not dare.Seeing what she was talking about, was he trying to help her?The two passed over Yzhar, who was shaking in rage, and Lenox, whose eyes were wide open in surprise that his brother, who he thought was heaven, was pushed deliberately.And without any hindrance, he entered the mansion and succeeded in climbing up to her room on the second floor.The Sword Master is in a critical condition, saying that it would not have a fun outcome if she moved, but there were no soldiers who were out of their minds in front of the street to stop them.***Psychke clenched the bag containing the trash and the note Aiden had left.And as soon as Lestir\u2019s carriage passed through the front door, she licked her lips.\u201cThank you for your help. Please drop me off anywhere nearby.\u201dVerndia, who was sitting opposite her, stared at her with his perplexed face. Then he languished his arms and leaned his back against the back of the wagon.\u201cIs the person named Aiden so important to the princess?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this because it seemed as if he hold an importance in your heart. Could he be the reason why you left the mansion? You\u2019ve never been so\u2014oh, excuse me. I think I preserved despite being ignored like this.\u201dWhen she heard about her shameful past from others, she became embarrassed. Psychke blushed slightly, and Verndia remembered her subconsciously that she was so cute the way she was.\u201cIt\u2019s not that. He was going to come out sooner or later.\u201dIf she had been dragged away as it was, he would have died in solitary confinement just like in her previous life.Psychke swallowed her inexpressible thoughts.After listening to her words, Verndia asked seriously.\u201cThen he\u2019s not her princess\u2019 lover?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026? Yes, that\u2019s not the case.\u201dShe looked like she was asking why.In other words, it doesn\u2019t matter whether she and Aiden are lovers or not.Verndia was just curious, so he said yes, and muttered. He doesn\u2019t even know why he was curious.\u201cIs there anywhere to go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a place in mind. I\u2019m going to check out the inns in the capital.\u201dHe replied looking out the window at the scenery passing by quickly. The thought of living alone out of the prison-like mansion made her heart flutter like a child.\u201cHow about in the Lestir mansion?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Pardon?\u201dAs it was an unexpected suggestion, the response was delayed by one beat.Psychke looked up at him.And she slowly shook her head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026 These days, the capital inns are infested with thieves. It would be dangerous.\u201d\u201cIs the security guard not patrolling properly? I\u2019ll have to talk to them.\u201dThe man who turned people who were working well into negligence quickly turned around.\u201cCome to think of it, that was last year, and I hear it\u2019s okay now. They said that the inn had no vacancy due to the upcoming festival.\u201dIt was a made-up statement, but it was not an unfounded story like the police force.A large-scale festival was scheduled to be held in the capital to commemorate the coming-of-age ceremony of the second prince shortly thereafter.When Psychke remembered it, she looked troubled. However, she soon relaxed her expression,\u201cStill, if you look closely, I will find at least one room left.\u201dWith she said, his heart exploded.\u201cThere will be none.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t checked, so there should be at least one.\u201d\u201cNo, there won\u2019t be. For sure.\u201dSince this happened, he was even thinking of taking the money to reserve all the inns in the capital.It was then.Hnnnng!The wagon came to a sudden stop at the same time as the screams of the startled horses could be heard from outside.\u201cKyaaaah!\u201dThe inside shook violently. She tried to hold on because of the force, but as a patient, she could not hold for much.As she was about to be thrown onto the floor, Verndia suddenly grabbed her. And the wagon shaking, her head was spinning, and her body was startled.She wasn\u2019t this cold when they were Silkisia. It seemed that his body was getting worse.\u201cWhere are you going with this body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s overwork. Rest and I will be fine.\u201dShe pushed him away, but he didn\u2019t want to loosen his arm. Instead, he banged on the wall where the horseman was.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cSuddenly a bird flew out of the grass, and the horses seem to be startled. Please forgive us.\u201dAfter the rearrangement, the carriage began to move smoothly.Then Verndia sat her down by his side, crossed his legs, and wiggled one of his feet.It meant that she was sitting uncomfortably.\u201cJust go to Lestir.\u201d\u201cNo. Please drop off as soon as you arrive in the city.\u201d\u201cIf you say that with a face that looks like you\u2019re about to faint, do you think I\u2019ll let you go?\u201d\u201cIf you let me off the street, there will be no mention of you leaving your sick fianc\u00e9e behind.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Ha\u201dEven in this situation, she was shocked to see him worrying about her reputation.How the hell does he see her?\u201cThere are a lot of rooms left in Lestir.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause you trouble.\u201d\u201cThe owner says it\u2019s okay, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cIt is a matter of my heart. I feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cDo you think my heart will be at ease if I let princess go like that? Also, if the Duke send enlisted soldiers from Silkisia, and you\u2019re not in good shape, can you handle them at least a bit?\u201dPsychke was silent for a moment.Although she warned that if they were release the enlisted men, Silkisia will be taken as innocent. So, shouldn\u2019t she be careful?No, it couldn\u2019t be. She doesn\u2019t know whether they will come to her in the middle of the night.Just thinking about it gave her a headache. But in any case, this had nothing to do with Verndia.\u201cAh, true. One more thing. It is a breach of contract if the princess is dragged to Silkisia.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dA question like a sigh followed after a sudden remark. Breach of contract?\u201cI don\u2019t know the circumstances, but considering that they even mobilized their enlisted men, it seems that they intent on imprisoning the princess. Then you can\u2019t come out on your own, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know that both parties must be together to break up a marriage? So-\u201d\u201cDuke, about our breakup.\u201dSomething came to mind at the word \u2018breakup\u2019. Psychke, who hardened her face, interrupted him.At the same time, Verndia also stiffened his face with tension.She tried to persuade him by giving him carrots. She also couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that somehow he had taken it out wrong.(TN: offer someone a carrot:to try to\u00a0persuade\u00a0someone to do something by\u00a0offering\u00a0them a\u00a0reward\u00a0if they do it )And that feeling became a reality.\u201cCan you do it right now?\u201d(TN: I wonder what will happen, hmm\u2026)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pardon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we have any reason to stay engaged anymore.\u201dThinking about it, it should be like that.She had already mentioned him how he should deal with the monsters. The gap between should be filled through Lia\u2019s request.\u201cNow you can deal with monsters without the support of the Imperial Knights.\u201dThe fact that the Imperial Knights were not needed was like not having to look at the emperor.Knowing that, she was sure that he had scratched Yzhar\u2019s pride.There was a look of embarrassment on Verndia\u2019s face, which had been stabbed in the face.He groaned in an unanswered way, and then responded bluntly.\u201cI never know if your method will work until I try. I should have assurance at least.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201dHalf-moon-like eyebrows drooped.Psychke was visibly disappointed. Seeing her like that, Verndia felt his heart burn with his own nervousness.\u2018I\u2019m going crazy.\u2019As a result of the calculations based on the previous events, Verndia vaguely realized that Psychke was about to sever her ties with Silkisia and disappear somewhere as soon as she broke her engagement with him.If that was the case, he wouldn\u2019t even tell him where she would settle.\u201cThen, would everything be okay if the monsters decreased to the amount of controllable?\u201d\u201c\u2026 .\u201dHe was utterly bewildered and looked at his fianc\u00e9e, who wasn\u2019t stopping and is still persuading him.Even just a week ago, she was crazily chasing at him and in an instant, their relationship turned the opposite way.How did it come to be like this?\u201cDuke?\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s when we have to talk and consider.\u201dHis mouth felt sore and bitter, but as if he has any other choice about it.She couldn\u2019t afford to delay the monsters\u2019 treatment simply because of her circumstances. So she had to convince him even before that.While they were talking, the carriage had arrived at Lestir.Verndia caught Psychke, who was trembling with vertigo while trying to get out first.\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn and stay here until your body gets better. With that body, it will be difficult to find a place to stay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Then, I will be indebted to you for a few days.\u201dWhen he was insistent, she can\u2019t just neglect it.Besides, it would be better if she were to rely on him than to froze somewhere who knows where alone, being vulnerable outside.Verndia, who got off the carriage, held out a hand.The strangely friendly escort was awkward, and Psychke crouched slightly to win the favor.And at that action, Verndia hardened his face again.This isn\u2019t really a perfect time to figure how can he persuade her to postpone their breakup. And that, he got a very extravagant idea.So as to not make thing more uncomfortable between them. He can simply let her stay in his mansion for as long as possible.She had to change her mind first.***Around that time, the head of Silkisia wasn\u2019t in a good mood.\u201cEverything is useless!\u201dBang! The ink bottle lying on his desk slammed against the door, making a loud noise, as it shattered. Expensive carpets on the floor were mottled and messed up with the thrown black ink.\u201cVerndia, Verndia!\u201dThe sound of breathing was harsh. The Duke was furious with the thought of chewing on the bones of his opponents.A few hours ago.He hurried to Psychke\u2019s room after hearing Yzhar\u2019s report that Verndia had ruined everything. And he met the two people; the man and the woman, beside each other.\u2018Duke, I\u2019ll take the princess.\u2019It was unpleasant for him to hear it from someone the same as the kid with no definite foundation in the past, and he kept his stiff neck like that.However, because of the sense of intimidation he felt, he did nothing more than refute it with words, rather than pulling out the sword of the soldier who was beside him.\u2018This is outright kidnapping!\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not kidnapping. Princess, am I taking you by force?\u2019\u2018No. I want to go out.\u2019\u201cHow dare you, without even knowing the subject!\u201dBang!Unable to win the fight, he smashed the desk violently.He has been doing what he has been hoping for. He even accepted her as the Silkisia\u2019s princess!(TN: You reap what you sow~)Things were going very strangely.As expected, at the party to celebrate Lillian\u2019s return, Psychke had not be gratitude.She had been shed tears, full of emotions, saying that even though the real princess, she wasn\u2019t driven or kicked out, as a lowly person, just like that emotion should have been on her face!But she didn\u2019t.She was ominous.But he felt that she was not shy, or that he needed some time to get back to her former self.It wasn\u2019t.That was my last chance to hold Psychke easily. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know her that time.Bang!Once again the peacock struck the desk with his fist.The papers on the desk trembled. A crystal vase of yellow freesias swayed precariously from his force as if toppling over.He stared at the vase with scorching eyes, and hurriedly sat down on a chair as he thought of something.Then he took out a blank piece of paper, folded it three times horizontally and twice vertically, unfolded it, and bit his fingertips, bleeding.He smeared blood at the intersection of the two lines, then folded it again twice horizontally and four times vertically.He made a secret note to be sent to the imperial family, pulled the string, and called the employee. And he ordered him to bring it to Yzhar.Soon, the eldest son in neat clothes came.\u201cYou searched for me, Your excellency\u201d\u201cGive this and go.\u201dYzhar knew what his father was offering.At the same time, he did not know.He knew that he had to pass this to a certain member of the imperial court in discreet, but he didn\u2019t know what would occur once he delivered this note.But, as always, he faithfully followed his father\u2019s instructions.\u201cAll right.\u201dOn the surface.He has never been a son where he thought that his father was doing was right.He was perplexed, not knowing why his father was so concerned with Psychke.Already, he had a feeling of inferiority to her, who was superior to him, and hid father showed great interest in that mere adopted child, so his observation is twisted.Yzhar, who took the note, bowed his back deeply. There was a gloom inside the black ink that his father\u2019s intentions.The duke, who did not see it, sent his son away without a doubt.***\u201cThat\u2026 Duke, I am speaking to you as an old man.\u201dIsolet, who had been looking at Verndia with meaningfully, carefully plucked his luck today.\u201cYou didn\u2019t really become that kind of relationship with the princess, did you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAs he changed into his casual clothes, and his hands stopped unraveling his cravat.At his absurd remark, Verndia raised an eyebrow.\u201cWhat the heck are you blabbering about?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dIsolet was silent. Because he honestly couldn\u2019t say, \u2018Look at you getting fired up.\u2019He sneaks out late at night and enjoys a walk until dawn.He goes out dressed up, saying he needs to go out for work.Those alone made him stunned, and he even let her stay here in his mansion for some reason.Well, whether the master was in love or not, it had nothing to do with him.Verndia falling in love.Like water and oil, it\u2019s a really inconsistent combination, but he\u2019s a human too, so he thought he\u2019d fall in love for some time, not so soon.However, he never imagined that the person in his dreams would be Princess Silkisia.\u201cWas I a leisure man?\u201dAs if reading the thought that flashed on his ace, Verndia shot him up.He\u2019s not the type to hide if he was dating someone. Isolet asked without hiding his doubts.\u201cThen why are you close to the princess? She said she was going to break up with you soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Uhm.\u201d(TN: Because I love her, should be your answer, change it, Verndia, change it!)Instead of affirming his words, Verndia closed his mouth and sighed deeply.Isolet\u2019s eyes narrowed, noticing something about his in his agonizing behavior.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s two-sided but a one-sided-\u201c\u201c\u2026 .\u201d\u201c- There is no way that it can be two-sided. Yes, that\u2019s can\u2019t be possible.\u201dIsolet quickly changed his words at his ferocious gaze as if he was going to eat him right away.Even so, his squinted eyes did not turn back, because an absurd assumption remained in his mind that the master seemed to be in unrequited love.\u201cIt was a bit of a pain in the butt.\u201dVerndia murmured in her low, gentle voice.\u2018She didn\u2019t seem to know anything.\u2019Had she known the truth, she wouldn\u2019t have considered Silkisia and her people as her family.Because she is no different than an enemy.\u2018But, Lia\u2019s behavior in the office.\u2019Now that he knew everything, he could guess what kind of conversation Psychke and Lia had.Perhaps it was related to Silkisia\u2019s unique ability.\u2018Is there any reason why someone who doesn\u2019t know the truth hides and fears so much?\u2019When she says he\u2019s nothing then he\u2019s nothing for her.The fear he felt through the ring. His pale white face was still clear.He don\u2019t know how it happened, but thanks to that, he was able to get the princess out of the Silkisia\u2019s mansion.\u2018Then why did the Duke of Silkisia tried to imprison his daughter?\u2019She\u2019s not even a small child, and just because she barely stayed out, why would he have to mobilize an adult to enlist and imprison her?It was strange.The Duke of Silkisia was a staunch opportunist. He was also known for never doing things that were not profitable.\u2018I think there is something fishy.\u2019Everything was questionable.Verndia wandered around his room, deep in his own thought.But she soon had to wake up to a voice calling her,\u201cI think I told you not to disturb me while I was thinking.\u201dWhen he shot him wildly, Isolet, who called him, protested, saying it was unfair.\u201cThe doctor called by the Duke has been waiting for you for 30 minutes.\u201dOh, has it already been that time? Verndia stopped walking. Though Psychke said she would leave as soon as she got better.He held on to something else, but he wasn\u2019t bad enough to let sick person alone and unattended.\u2018What am I holding on to ..?\u2019He tapped his chin in a brief thought, then opened his mouth at once.\u201cWhat do women like?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes?\u201dIsolet froze at his questions.Verndia, who couldn\u2019t see his butler\u2019s expression as he looked down at a distance, asked seriously,\u201cIs there anything noble girls would like?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to give gifts to the princess\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIsolet was silently astonished that his guess was correct.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To even do something like this.\u2019Did he ask an employee who adored him to do something like this for him? Someone had brought the neatly folded note on her desk.The content of the note was short.\u300c \u201cOn 14th.\u201d \u300dWas it because of his fear that someone might see her? It was written very abstractly, but it was enough for Psychke to comprehend.\u2018Tomorrow night, we\u2019re going to meet in that alleyway.\u2019She doesn\u2019t feel well, but she needs to go. She thinks that it was better to do it now than later when she recovered,\u2018It must have been because he was beaten up due to his \u2018said\u2019 incompetence as my escort.\u2019It was Yzhar who was of course in charge of Silkisia\u2019s soldiers. And he tended those soldiers like a numb person, as if they were his tools.She knew that she needs to recuperate to regain her energy and health, but she was disturbed by Aiden\u2019s kindness. Psychke fiddled with the edge of the note.It was then. A knock was heard.\u201cPrincess\u2013\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dPsychke said before the visitor could reveal whom it could be. She was so absorbed in her own thoughts that she had forgotten for a moment that she was apparently staying in the Lestir mansionThe other party didn\u2019t respond for a while, perhaps embarrassed because she interrupted his supposed speech.After the door was opened, only did Psychke remembered and realized that she was not in Silkisia anymore and saw the two men that came in one after another. She tried to get out of her bed, but Verndia stopped her. Then Verndia nodded at the man beside him.\u201cHe\u2019s a Lestir\u2019s physician.\u201d\u201cIt is an honor to meet you, Princess.\u201d\u201cGreetings.\u201dShe greeted the physician that was polite to her with the same courtesy.She wondered what\u2019s this about.\u201cI heard that you have a chronic illness. May I ask what kind it is?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dShe thought that Verndia\u2019s kindness was only up to giving her a room.She never imagined that he would even call a physician for her.It\u2019s the first time she has ever received such kindness from someone.Losing her words and turning her head away, Verndia, who met her gaze, drew a wrinkle on his forehead.\u201cI won\u2019t ever ask you to pay for the treatment, so tell us quickly.\u201dOh, it wasn\u2019t a kindness, but the obligation for her to get well soon so she could get out of his mansion sooner.(TN: Oh, gurl you got him wrong!)\u201cIf it\u2019s uncomfortable for you to let me know it, I\u2019ll just go out.\u201d\u201cNo. it\u2019s okay.\u201dBecause as soon as her body recovered, she had already decided to leave. Psychke turned to the physician again and thought about it, then calmly lied.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what it is. Sometimes I get headaches of unknown cause.\u201dIt was so intense that she couldn\u2019t bear it.People around her used to say that it\u2019s not a disease, and that she was fine, but she\u2019s sensitive as it is and felt sick all the time.So Psychke only drank the tea that Yzhar sent her, but never took any action.The physician looked at her closely. She felt bad that she lied to the physician.The examination took quite a long time.At the time when she was nervous and felt like losing her mind after faking her words at the physician\u2019s serious expression, the physician voiced out,\u201cHuh, no way this could be real? You and your body are similar? Do you two have anything in common?\u201d(TN: Love it is~)The doctor said in a strange voice.Verndia intervened.\u201cMy body?\u201d\u201cI feel something clumped up in every corner of her body. It\u2019s sort of like a foreign object.\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression changed at the word foreign the physician mentioned. He was like someone who noticed a secret that could not be easily told.The attending physician, who did not notice it, continued to explain.\u201cAs I have said to Your Highness (Psychke) before, this usually accumulates through the intake of food. Do you have anything that you usually intake, besides meals?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no such thing.\u201d\u201cThat is strange. This foreign thing is the cause of your current fever now. There must be something blocking your energy to completely flow in.\u201d(TN: This was MTL-ed as \u2018Blocking the road\u2019, I thought maybe \u2018meridians\u2019 would be better, but it has a different meaning, so I am hoping that you understood what this part implies.)As the explanation continued, Verndia\u2019s expression became more and more strange.\u201cIt seems that foreign thing that you are taking\u2026 is bigger and stronger. If you give me more time, I will make sure to put a lot of concentration and study this.\u201dShe felt strange at the sincere words.It was simply a lie that she had said. Was she really sick?The moment she was thinking about whether she should tell the truth. Verndia, who had a serious face, shooed the physician away.He sent the doctor out to do as he pleases. And before Psychke could say anything, he opened his mouth.Agitated, he spoke very quickly.\u201cHave you really not eaten anything other than a meal?\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d\u201cOr have you eaten the same kind thing for at least a few years?\u201d\u201cSomething like that is\u2013\u201dWait.There was something. For at least a few years which she had obediently eaten something without missing a single day.\u201cIt\u2019s tea.\u201d\u201cTea?\u201d\u201cOlder brother Yzhar sent me tea every morning, although I\u2019ve been drinking the same type consistently for over a decade.\u201dPsychke blurted her words.Why did she forget this?\u201cI guess that was the problem.\u201dVerndia, who finally found out the real reason why the princess fell that time when she had won the fight against the mercenery, sneered at her.All the medicines Lia made were good, but there was one side effect.\u2018The power to suppress the flames doesn\u2019t just go to the heart.\u2019That power travels here and there through his blood vessels, and it gathers and settles in one place, and that is the foreign substance the doctor said to them.It was difficult to exert one\u2019s ability to the fullest if there was a foreign object in their bodies.So Verndia was taking Lia\u2019s medicine and his doctor\u2019s medicine at the same time.Of course, he didn\u2019t tell the doctor about Lia and only told him that he had to eat something because he needed it.\u2018I have no choice but to eat to suppress the flame.\u2019Silkisia\u2019s ice was an ability that did not need to be suppressed.Besides, the fact that Yzhar has been feeding her without her knowledge for over ten years\u2026\u2018He was trying to prevent her abilities from being displayed. Then..-\u2018Ah.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because that\u2019s exactly how they treated Psychke.Yzhar was the one who gave her the tea, but it\u2019s a bit vague to say the two other siblings knows, and the Head of Silkisia seems to know too.By the time the thought that he was nearing of understanding the circumstances came to his mind,\u201cI drank it to relieve my headache.\u201dAm explaining voice woke him up.Psychke had a look on her face that he didn\u2019t understand.It wasn\u2019t that Yzhar was skeptical, but the facts did not match. Rather than a symptom caused by the tea, she was already suffering from a headache before that.\u201cThat-\u201dHe paused while trying to explain.When a sleeping ability wakes up for the first time, it adapts to unfamiliar stimuli.It\u2019s her body that can\u2019t handle the pain.To let her know\u2026.After a short deliberation, he opened his mouth.\u201cDoes the princess know what Silkisia\u2019s power is?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it that ice that doesn\u2019t melt?\u201dNonsensical question. Besides, common sense among that even a three-year-old child of the Empire knows.Asking that all of a sudden, Psychke was puzzled.Likewise, with her bewildered expression on her face, Verndia looked at her sullenly.\u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me, you were acting even though you knew everything?\u201d\u201cActing, you mean?\u201dThe expression on her questioning face made him feel frustrated as if she didn\u2019t really know anything.Is she really just ignorant, or is she trying to act like she was innocent to protect herself?\u2018The latter is nothing but scraping and crumbling.\u2019There was nothing good about touching the hidden weakness even though it was not enough to gain favor.Verndia wiped his face with one of his hands. Then he ended up breaking his luck because he couldn\u2019t overcome his hasty temper.\u201cI only came to know about the auction house, but I did not do any background research, so please do not misunderstand. In fact, she said you are the daughter of Leas-.\u201dCaw! The sudden crowing of a crow swallowed what he was saying. The two turned their heads without saying anything at first.Outside the window, where dark clouds covered the moon, a yellow-eyed crow was pecking at the window with its beak.\u201cTut.\u201d(TN: It\u2019s the sound of crow who pecked the window.)Verndia, who frowned slightly, opened the window. The crow flew towards him and sat on his forearm. She was very curious as she looked at him and rubbed her beak. Psychke couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him.Generally speaking, when it comes to pet birds of nobles, they are corporations with all natural pets. It was the first time she saw anyone raising a crow.\u201cI would have waited. Why did you come all the way here?\u201dVerndia murmured with his distraught face.Did the crow even understand what he was saying? The crow spread its wings wide and howled.\u201cThe duke, to the imperial family?\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression turned cold. He was about to say something more, but he bit his lips because he realized that Psychke was beside him.\u201cIt\u2019s late, so you better be sleeping now.\u201dLike someone who had urgent business, he left in a hurry. He didn\u2019t even close the window he had opened.\u2018It wasn\u2019t just a pet bird, was it a carrier pigeon then?\u2019Psychke, who had closed the window and drew the curtains instead of Verndia, who had left, was suddenly overcome with a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that she had seen that bird somewhere.***\u201cYou\u2019re saying princess that\u2026 you want to leave?\u201dIsolet, who had come since morning, murmured in vain.Psychke calmly nodded her head.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWa, wait a minute. I\u2019ll just call the handmaid-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019d be looking like someone who takes advantage to someone who\u2019s willing to take care of me if you do that.\u201dDressed modestly and unduly like a princess, she walked out of her room past a bewildered aide.\u201cNo, anyway, this is- Wait, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit.\u201dJust last night, she was worried about when her body would recover.She felt better now. She wasn\u2019t really feeling that so well, but it\u2019s enough for her to leave.It was thanks to the doctor of Lestir that Verndia gave her.\u2018Once a day, if you drink it consistently for about a month, almost all foreign substances accumulated in your body will disappear.\u2019Did he stay up all night to create the medicine?The attending physician who visited at dawn had a gloomy, but proud face under his eyes.\u2018Then the headache will go away?\u2019\u2018Of course.\u2019It was a pain that had been with her for decade. Was it really that easy to treat?Psychke swallowed the medicine he had given her with a questionable face.And, startled, she widened his eyes.\u2018\u2026 !\u2019Was it true that foreign substance was disappearing? It felt like something was melting all over hrt body.Her nauseous stomach subsided, and her heavy body became lighter. Even her throbbing head became cool as if she had put an ice pack on it.\u2018How is it?\u2019\u2018Really\u2026 I am fine now. Thank you so much.\u2019Psychke went straight to Verndia. So that she could inform him that she will be leaving today, thanking him for attaching her an excellent primary care physician.However, when she heard from the butler she met in the hallway that \u2018the Duke is absent\u2019, she returned to her room and prepared to go out without informing him any further.And just as she was about to leave. Isolet came.\u201cCan I ask where you are going?\u201dIsolet asked as he followed her as she ran across the hallway.\u201cSince I\u2019m feeling better, I feel like I can go out. I will find a place to stay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe terrified Isolet stood tall and stopped, as if his life had reduced twenty times.(TN: You shall be remembered, my dear Isolet.)Then he came to his senses and hurriedly ran out and blocked her in front.\u201cYou- you ca-can\u2019t do that!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isolet groaned inwardly.\u2018Why am I even doing this\u2026?!\u2019A few hours ago, he was focused on searching for gifts that noble ladies like, and now his eyes were colored red because of that.When he had organized the things those noble ladies like, he thought that he could close his eyes. But,\u2018Isolet!\u2019His master, Verndia, slammed the door opened. When he left the mansion to do his work, he demanded Isolet to assist Psychke to her every needs.\u2018\u2026 Are you calling for me?\u2019\u2018If not you, then who else?\u2019Attending the guests.Those words were no different from being a maid.But Isolet swallowed the words that such things should be done by maids or servants. It was because the other person was making a face that he didn\u2019t know what was wrong.This is a disaster. Verndia must have really fallen in love deep and strong.\u201cOh, um, that\u2019s-\u201dIsolet tried his best to figure out what he had to say.He wasn\u2019t even the owner of the mansion so he can\u2019t ask her to stay longer, but Verndia, who was insistent of letting her go, shone in his mind.He should have quitted his work sooner.What the hell does money means anyway?In the end, he decided to mix truth and lies in moderation.\u201cHonestly, I know some good places for the Princess to stay in. Would it be alright for you if I lead you there? The Duke especially commanded me that the Princess must not stay in a shabby, ugly place.\u201dIt was the only and best way to follow where she\u2019d be staying, alongside carrying Verndia\u2019s order to assist her.\u201c\u2026. Please do so.\u201dWhy do they keep paying attention to her?Psychke was utterly puzzled.Well, her fianc\u00e9e will lose face if she stays in a shabby place, and she also wanted to see more places thus she decided to accept Isolet\u2019s offer.***\u201cI really didn\u2019t know there would be this much.\u201dIt was an afternoon when the sun was setting. Psychke and Isolet were patting their sore legs in a cafe.To exaggerate a bit, they toured all the inns in the capital.Of course, except for places that are too old or unsafe.Surprisingly, Psychke was discouraged by the fact that there was not a single vacant room.\u201cIt must be because of the prince\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony. People from other countries came to see him in person.\u201dAnd looking at the princess\u2019s expression, Isolet felt relieved.His master, who doesn\u2019t quite fit the word love, actually fell in love with his unrequited love, and to his fianc\u00e9e, who would have to divorce him sooner or later.(TN: Lol hahaha!)There\u2019s a villa on the outskirts of the capital, so if she doesn\u2019t have to place to go, she can rent it out.Judging from that, his master seemed to want to be with the princess badly.If there was really one vacant room, he would have been arguing with Verndia over why he had left the princess. When he imagined that certain situation, even though it was not cold, his body trembled.\u201cHooh.\u201dPsychke sighed in disappointment and changed the subject.\u201cAs soon as the prince-coming-of-age ceremony is over, the Duke will return to the North, right?\u201d\u201cYes, probably. We\u2019ll have to see until it\u2019s finish. I also heard that the princess put a lot of effort into it. Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWe will officially invite you when the estate stabilizes later. Everyone will love it if you visit.\u201dHer marriage with Verndia by that time is broken, so there is no way she would go. It was difficult for her to go to the North because of her characteristics.But Psychke said, \u2018Yes, I will.\u2019 She then gently closed her eyes.It was then.\u201c\u2026 So, princess, don\u2019t just cry and talk slowly.\u201d\u201cHeuk, hiccup, hiccup, Lady Hilvia\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us here. Come on, look. There\u2019s also a ban on eavesdropping, right? So, don\u2019t worry and just say it out loud. What did Princess Psychke did to you?\u201dThe cafe they are currently in was a place where each table was separated with a curtain.Also, there is a magic set which made it prohibited to eavesdrop whatever is happening on each seat, which is why nobles often came here to share secret stories.(TN: It won\u2019t be secret anymore if it\u2019s shared~)This is why Psychke and Isolet also came to this place.Suddenly, Hilvia and Lillian\u2019s conversation began to be heard clearly from the other side.\u201c\u2026 !\u201dThe two people, Isolet and Psychke, were shocked and kept their mouth shut without speaking.Then she blinked at the magic stone on the table and said without a sound.\u2018Is the magic stone broken?\u2019\u2018Or maybe they forgot to recharge the mana at the store\u2026\u2019Significant eyes intertwined in the air.The two held their breath as they exchanged views quietly. And listened to the story of the next table.\u201cPsychke left the house yesterday.\u201dIntermittently stuttering as if holding back her tears, Lilian spilled the beans.The day before leaving the house, Psychke, who had been escorted by a knight late at night, disappeared somewhere.And as soon as Lillian got back, she got mad at Psychke for making the whole family worried for her disappearance, and then she ran out of the house.Finally\u2026.\u201cMy father was shocked and fainted. My brothers left everything they were doing and are looking for Psychke\u2019s whereabouts.\u201dVerndia is not here with them. Even so, Isolet, who understood her situation, couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut from the secret story between the family that was being revealed like this.Psychke scoffed at the rumors about her in this way.\u201cIs she crazy?\u201dHearing Lilian\u2019s words, it was a reaction that had to come out of course.\u201cNo, so is the Duke. Why is he still keeping that poorly behaved adopted child in your family?\u201d\u201cI wonder that too but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Oh my gosh!\u201dHilvia, who had already had a bad feeling for Psychke, cheered for Lillian.(TN: Here we go again with the \u2018real fakes\u2019 people. Tch.)\u201cThat fake must have scared other people.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Psychke could do that\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, indeed. Princess is so naive. Isn\u2019t that why the Duke of Verndia is keeping his engagement with her?\u201dFlutter, flutter. There was a loud fanning sound, trying to calm her excitement.Then at some point, while folding the fan, Hilvia confidently said,\u201cIt\u2019s better that way. Duke will also be completely taken away with her if you knew about her dirty conduct.\u201d\u201cHe, heuk\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not worry. I\u2019ll make sure that she won\u2019t carry her face around.\u201dIsolet opened his mouth at the sound of the two ladies spreading false rumors. If Verndia had known about this, Marquis Esland would not be able to slip out of this.But before he worried about the Marquis of Esland, he took a look at Psyche\u2019s eyes.Speaking of this.Contrary of what he was expecting that Psychke would be offended, she didn\u2019t have an offended face. Rather, her expression was more casual.Still, he just couldn\u2019t get over it. Isolet comforted her.\u2018You may be upset, but you don\u2019t have to worry too much. I\u2019ll tell the Duke-\u2018\u2018No, I am fine.\u2019It was the words she said from her own very mouth.She was really alright.Isolet had no intention of having Psychke\u2019s reputation to fall further, so she didn\u2019t have to hear such ugly things in about her front of her face.Psychke smiled softly. And Isolet thought that her smile looked very sad.\u201cReally, I mean it sincerely.\u201dThe woman who had vowed to swear at Psychke changed her topic.\u201cIs there a man with blue-green eyes among Silkisia? The impression he let off is sharp.\u201d\u201cUm? No. I remember none of my relatives has that. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOh, I went somewhere, and there was this man who looked at me like he was going to kill me.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be good to brag that it was when she went to illegal auction house, so Hilvia hid that location.\u201cThat time, I thought I was going to die because of his gaze. But I couldn\u2019t say anything because he\u2019s a Silkisia.\u201dAs she sighed heavily and fed up, Lillian patted her, as if consoling her.She had a pure yet soft voice that seemed to understand others well.Then, excited, Hilvia explained the situation without Lillian asking her.\u201cLeas said something. \u2018If you want to die, you should die beautifully. Why are you even doing something bad?\u2019 I wonder why he\u2019s staring at me like that? It\u2019s something I can\u2019t say.\u201d\u201cLeas?\u201dIt must have been the case where the Crown Princess almost died.The Leas case was not widely known among people so that it won\u2019t disturb the people\u2019s livelihood.Lillian asked in a very curious tone.\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t know.\u201dHilvia recited the Leas\u2019s case to her fuss.Psychke already knew the content, but she felt strange hearing it again. When the emperor reached the point that he had to revive the family using the imperial power, Psychke muttered to herself.\u2018I don\u2019t know what kind of family that is\u2026. Is it good luck or bad luck?\u2019When the incident happened, all people would have died.The family name was still alive, so she couldn\u2019t tell if it was a good thing or a bad thing.As such, it was near the end of the case.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret, though.\u201dHilvia, who suddenly lowered her voice, pulled her head forward to Lillian.\u201cWell. Should I speak or should I not?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026..\u201dDespite the repeated promptings, Hilvia only hesitated and could not continue her words properly.Lillian looked at her as she looked at her and gently exhorted her.\u201cI will not tell this to anyone or anywhere. So, Lady, you can speak freely. So please let me know.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Phew. I\u2019m just saying it because it\u2019s strange that a Silkisia doesn\u2019t know about Silkisia\u2019s history. Please don\u2019t misunderstand me, I\u2019m not saying I have any bad feelings or anything like that.\u201dWhat made Hilvia so anxious? Hilvia, a wealthy lady, spoke her words with difficulty.\u201cHe\u2019s a Silkisia.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe family of Leas. \u2026was Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201dLillian was utterly surprised.Lilian was speechless as she let out her breath. Even Psychke, who was listening calmly, shut her mouth at the sudden revelation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The imperial family hates it.\u201d\u201cThe Imperial\u2026 family?\u201d\u201cNo matter how important a family is to an empire, there are still people who stumble over some strange facts that the said family was pardoned or that there was something else going on. Oh, and of course, I was excluded!\u201dHilvia drew a line and supported the choice of His Majesty, the emperor.\u201cNevertheless, you can\u2019t go anywhere revealing what I told you. Do you understand, Princess?\u201d\u201cSure. Of course. However-\u201dLillian secretly lengthened the end of her words.Her voice must have been mixed up with her \u2018cute voice\u2019 which she used to stab people in the past. Psychke who had been engrossed in their conversation came to her senses.\u201cThat emerald necklace. Was it called Keitan? What happened after that? It\u2019s an important piece evidence, so could it be hidden in the imperial palace?\u201d\u201cI thought the same way, but they said no. The necklace must have been lost.\u201d\u201cLost?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard that there was a thief who broke inside while they were still stunned to see that the gift has poison?\u201d\u2018A thief in the Imperial Palace?\u2019Even if a thief broke into the mansion of a high-ranking nobleman, it would be rather ridiculous if it was the imperial palace that had been stolen from.It was definitely nonsense.\u2018It\u2019s really strange.\u2019It is weird that the emperor pardoned the attempted murder of the royal family, and it wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the history. The evidence had disappeared on top of that. In addition, the emperor hates to dwell into this matter again.At this point, it can be assumed that the investigation which happened 20 years ago wasn\u2019t even properly conducted.\u2018Come to think of it, 20 years ago\u2026 was when the former Duchess of Lestir died suddenly. It may have gone unnoticed because of that incident.\u2019\u201cHmm, lost. Hmm\u2026\u201dAs Psychke was contemplating what happened back 20 years ago, a voice which wondered where the necklace which has poison into it bothered her ears.\u201cIf His majesty didn\u2019t know that that it has poison, it would have been created by a skilled craftsman. I wonder who made it.\u201d\u201cOh my, princess. You ace curios about everything, oh, why is this turned off?\u201dThe sound was cut off at the end of the startled voice. It was as if Hilvia had misplaced the eavesdropping ban magic stone.Isolet and Psychke quickly exchanged glances. They then hurriedly left before the next table could see if they had eavesdropped on them.* * *It was the time when the sun had set, and the darkness had come.Psychke sent Isolet back first. He also asked for her understanding because the duke has some things he has to tell him.\u201cI certainly did my best. Please talk to me later when you\u2019re finished.\u201dHe looked like he was being dragged into hell.He thought Psychke knew how much Verndia tormented him, so Psychke said with a pity.Alone, she headed to the alley where she and Aiden last parted.The Silkisia mansion is nearby.She raised her vigilance so that she could draw a dagger at any time when necessary. Still, on the other hand, she had other thoughts.\u2018So it was Lillian.\u2019Before she returned time, Lillian smiled slyly to her as she watched Psychke faced death.Thus, Psychke presumed that it was Lillian who framed that she stole the necklace. It seemed to be right considering how much attention she paid to the necklace.\u2018Are you going to do the same thing again this time?\u2019She said she was no longer in Silkisia, but Lilian said she had lost everything, and she hated her.It can\u2019t be concluded hadn\u2019t for the possibilities.\u2018I don\u2019t get beaten up like I did back then.\u2019Psychke clenched her fists. Then she looked around.As the surrounding was quiet, Aiden didn\u2019t seem to have arrive yet.\u2018He\u2019s a little late.\u2019She was thinking that it was around this time when she and Verndia broke their marriage. Did she miscalculate it? She was killing time by kicking his cold feet against the cold wall.Footsteps, she felt something approaching.It wasn\u2019t the sound of a single footstep. It wasn\u2019t the sound of human footsteps too.Psychke drew her dagger. And she swung straight in the direction she felt the presence from.\u2013 Kiieek!The creature blew up and its blood splattered. Something like wolf howled with its waist cut in two.He had a bright red body. And a red jewel on his forehead. Finally, the black blood which flowed from his waist.It was no ordinary creature.\u2018Monster?\u2019The only creatures with black blood are beasts made with forbidden magic.There was no time to wonder why it was here. She could feel them coming from her behind.Psychke immediately leaned over and thrusted the sword in the opposite direction.She cut through its body.\u2018Is there three of them over?\u2019The beasts clamored to bite her, even when it was suffocated.Psychke moved her feet away from its teeth, sharpening her senses.Her unrecovered body was thrown somewhere. But she didn\u2019t drop her dagger. Black blood dripped down her short sword.\u2018Why are the beasts here?\u2019Forbidden magic was a magic that required vitality as much as it has excellent effect. It wasn\u2019t something that could be done by somewhere anywhere he wants.She doesn\u2019t feel good about this.She has to escape.\u2018But, if I go on my way like this, Aiden\u2026\u2019What if he gets attacked alone?\u2026 No, what if this situation was a trap he had prepared in the first place?It was then that she licked her lips, unable to decide.\u201c\u2026.!\u201dPsychke, who raised her head at the sudden feeling of getting attacked, doubted her eyes.Ah, that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t notice until just before the attack.There was a wave in the empty air, and a lump came off like clay.That was the only way she could explain it.The clumps that came off, distorted her view, and created black wolves.It looked as if there were ten of them.\u2018I have to run.\u2019Now was the right time for the unfinished wolves to close their eyes.However, knowing that, her feet did not manage to run.The speed of creating magical beasts was too fast. In her current state, she could not even take five steps and seemed to be caught behind.\u2018I can\u2019t do anything\u2026\u2019If it\u2019s an unavoidable battle, it\u2019s better not to look behind her.Psychke raised her mana.A much cruder blue power than that of Verndia surrounded the dagger.I was worried, but fortunately, the cursed ability didn\u2019t fluctuate as much as in the auction house. It was similar to usual.\u2013 Krruuuu!\u2013 Kun! Kung! Kung!The completed beasts exposed their teeth. As soon as they opened their eyes, a red jewel settled on their forehead, and their body turned red.It meant that they were ready to attack.Psychke grabbed the dagger as hard as she could.\u2013 Kung!In the narrow alleyway, the beast in the middle of the front row rushed in. With that as a starting point, the rest moved as well. The puddles and corpses trampled upon by them spattered black blood.\u201cUgh!\u201dA grunt came out of her mouth. It was different from the ones she met at the auction house. These monsters are stronger and bigger.She has bad physical condition and a short sword at that.In extremely difficult conditions, Psychke cut and cut again.Five, seven, ten\u2014After that, she felt giving up.]Unlike the first three she had defeated; this one showed no sign of ending.\u2018I think I\u2019ve killed at least twenty. Why isn\u2019t it over yet then?\u2019She didn\u2019t realize what was wrong until she rolled on the floor to dodge their attacks.They had no body.\u201cHa\u2026..\u201dEven though they looked the same, they had different abilities, and the bodies of the torn-up beasts were returning to their masters, wriggling as if they were alive.In a word, the reproducibility was too great.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Psychke gritted her teeth, knocking down the two that rushed for her arms and heart.It was just a meaningless question she asked. She already knew the answer.If she can\u2019t defeat it, she must tie their feet up.That way she can run away.To survive.And for that\u2014\u2018\u2026I have to live somehow. At least now.\u2019In the past, seeing that no one mourned her death, Psychke has realized something.An earnest desire to be recognized and loved by someone.In this life, one more was added to her wish.If she received love, of course it will happen eventually.It is not impossible to achieve it even if she does not need to be loved.If other heard her wish, they might wonder why she wants that.She can\u2019t die until she fulfilled that wish.Even if she had to use to cursed ability of hers.\u2013 Kung! Kung!Her thought was long, but the action of the other party was quick.She reached out to the demonic beast that jumped to the side where she did not raise her sword.She could feel the energy that forcibly confined in her body and spread all over.Blatantly\u2013Again, it didn\u2019t go as what she planned. She tried to freeze only her snout, but half of her body and the wall of the alley behind her were already covered with ice.Puk. A lump of ice that had landed on the floor made the monster unable to get up, with only its free hind legs rattling.She bit her lip while freezing the beast which she had just cut off its body.\u2018Let\u2019s run away as soon as it\u2019s over. Then it will be fine.\u2019There are about five minutes before the ice let out.No one will come in the meantime anyway. There\u2019s no sense of movement around.Thump, thump. Ice, the size of a child\u2019s head, was created randomly in mid-air, fell. There was nothing inside the ice.Psychke tried not to see them and focused only on the beasts.This was the reason why, according to the people, they regarded her powers as a curse.Control is impossible.Freeze anything without identifying who are her real enemies.She is no exception of her power, or even the formless air.It was quite different from the freezing magic that was cast only when there was a specific target.It was the time when all the beasts were frozen and the last one remained.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh!\u201dThe ability that was randomly bouncing finally paid off. She had frozen her feet.She scrambled before she froze completely.The anger caused by the brief gap was great. The fangs of the demonic beast, which she had not cut properly, came close to her eyes.She had drained her energy to lift her dagger. Her selfish ability only froze the lower half of the beast.Oh, is this the end? Psychke squeezed her eyes shut.\u201cThis, crazy! Princess!\u201dKwang!Purple flames rose like a wall.\u201cPrincess!\u201dThe voice of a man she thought betrayed her followed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The unmelting ice which did not touch the flame touched her feet instead.\u2018Ah \u2026.\u2019The power that started on her toes quickly engulfed her mind.It was vast, and terrifying.\u2018Psychke, keep in mind that if others find out about your ice\u2014\u2019Whether to kill with her own hands or,Die under someone\u2019s hand.She grabbed her dagger. She gave so much strength that her veins appeared to be shining white.The moment when fear-ridden walls and peace intertwined in the air.\u201c..!\u201dVerndia stopped his feet with his face distorted, realizing something about her.Kwang!There was a loud bang from behind. Her silver hair fluttered wildly in the sudden sound.Startled, Psychke turned around. She doubted what she saw afterwards.A huge tornado-shaped purple fire flower engulfed everything around her.The walls of the alleyway collapsed without shape. The ice had long since melted, and only the beasts trapped in the ice were rubbed against the wall, burning, and crying in pain.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dThat was the time when she was already staring blankly at the beasts which were turning into ashes.Aiden, who had just approached her, asked. The look of shock was clearly visible on his face, which had been dyed the same color as the flames.\u201cWhere did you get hurt\u2026 oh my.\u201dHe reached out for the melted sleeves and poison-stained scars of hers.\u2018Did I caught them?\u2019Shocked, Psychke took a step back. At the same time, a rustling sound was heard,\u201cDon\u2019t touch her.\u201dA sword-like word fell between the two of them.It was Verndia.He pushed Aiden, who had stopped walking. And whispered so that only Psychke could hear it.\u201cYou probably didn\u2019t see anything over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201d\u201cWhen I first made the wall, I purposely set the scope wide.\u201dHer mind was blown.\u2018They\u2019re over there. So, the Duke\u2026?\u2019Her feet trembled and her exhausted body sank like a cotton soaked in the water.When she bit her lips, a blood came out which tasted fishy. She swallowed the blood forcefully and coerced herself not to collapse.\u201cYou.. saw?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I broke the wall?\u201dIn an instant, her legs lost strength and nearly collapsed. But Verndia didn\u2019t see it and passed by.It was to deal with the others who flocked to the purple flames that were clearly seen from afar.As he went his way, he warned Aiden not to approach Psychke recklessly.However, Aiden approached Psyche as soon Verndia vanished, and gave a guilty voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Something happened to the Princess while you are waiting for me and while I was away. I also didn\u2019t know that something like this would happen.\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s fine.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know if she could believe if Aiden said that he never saw anything.She calmed her pounding heart and acted as calmly as possible.However, her shaking legs betrayed her will and staggered.Aiden supported her.\u201cWhen I came back, there was a strange barrier, so I couldn\u2019t arrive on time. I should have come right in that time.\u201d\u201cA strange barrier?\u201d\u201cYes, the Duke said it was like a kind of barrier.\u201dA barrier. Is that why she didn\u2019t feel any movements around her?\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I heard this right.\u201dAiden, who narrowed his eyebrows, hesitated for a moment, and then spoke slightly.\u201cHe said it was made with forbidden magic\u2026\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHer head went cold.Forbidden magic has been erased from history because of the contempt and cruelty of life it brought, and the side effects that come after the magic is accomplished.Occasionally, there were worshipers who wanted to continue that magic.As long as the pulse of magic was cut off, the only thing they could do was craft magic beasts.Even if that was not a real beast, but a fake one maximized the ferocity of the beasts.\u2018But, that was before.\u2019The wolves she just encountered were obviously born from darkness.They didn\u2019t look clumsy like the ones she saw at the auction house.That is\u2014No, before that thought,\u2018Can I trust Sir Aiden?\u2019It\u2019s weird that someone who isn\u2019t a wizard have knowledge of the broken magic.Even if he knew it, it was strange that he said it to her.\u2018Maybe, it could be a trap\u2026\u2019\u201cI clearly told you not to approach her.\u201dThe thought of going deep into it was interrupted. Verndia approached them with a wrinkled face.The purple flame that ate all of its prey had faded away. The whole place was filled with ashes of unrecognizable form.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t care about what I said, right?\u201dHe took Psychke from Aiden\u2019s grasp and hugged her.Psychke was somewhat perplexed.She knew that the crown prince disdained Hillace family specifically.\u201c\u2026 As I said before, I am not in contract with Silkisia family.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe you?\u201dHowever she only heard it but not have seen it in person.She was very embarrassed by Verndia\u2019s actions and speech as if Aiden was his enemy.\u2018If they don\u2019t get along like this, was it a set-up of forbidden magic then?\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Is this the Aiden the Princess has a lot of interest to?\u201dVerndia, who was shooting Aiden with his sharp voice, suddenly asked.The moment her and Verndia\u2019s eyes met, felt her heart sinking.Psychke trembled. She couldn\u2019t understand why he have to hide his abilities.\u201cTut.\u201dIn a panic, she had forgotten what the power of the ring in her finger has. Seeing the emotions being conveyed here and there, she realized she did something without thinking.Verndia clicked his tongue.\u201cDuke!\u201dBehind them, a man ran hurriedly and was frightened.When he showed up, it was Isolet, who had been suffering from the beasts instead of Verndia.\u201cYou should have written an investigation report-\u201c\u201cDo it yourself. All you need to do is ask for a repair fee.\u201d\u201cYou need a reason why you broke the wall.\u201d\u201cI did it because I was bored. Do I have to tell you all of that?\u201dEven for an absurd reason, Isolet kept his head low without changing her expression.Why did his name have to be \u2018Crazy Dog?\u2019(TN: Because he\u2019s crazy for Psychke. Oof-)Psychke was used to this kind of bicker.Psychke realized that he was trying to keep not only her abilities but also the fact that the Demon Beast appeared.But she couldn\u2019t move his mouth to ask why, so she clenched her fists tightly, then raised her eyes wide open at the words that followed him.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that guy was up to, pretending to be a soldier, but you\u2019d better pay attention.\u201dObvious hostility.Even the back of his hand was aimed at the opponent\u2019s neck.Aiden was surprised that Verndia had come out like this, but after a while, he regained his senses and calmly responded to Verndia.\u201cIt\u2019s not what the Duke thinks.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking as if I\u2019ve gone insane.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t touch a good man, who chases after his master like a dog. I am only going easy on you this time.\u201dVerndia, who spoke as if forced, put the sword in back to its sheathe.\u201cLet\u2019s go, princess.\u201d\u201cYes? Wait\u2013!\u201dHe grabbed her and took her feet before Psychke could say anything.Surprised, Psychke hurriedly looked behind her, but Aiden could not be seen because of Verndia\u2019s wide chest.\u201cI mean, he is an Hillace, what the hell is the princess thinking?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPsychke, who was trying to get away from him, stopped moving.It was a weird question.Silkisia and Hillace were from the same faction and had no reason not to be close as they had a strict master-slave relationship.Perhaps not expecting an answer, Verndia continued speaking sternly.\u201cActually, as you said he is a private soldier, so maybe you didn\u2019t know his last name. You don\u2019t even do public service or social activities, so you might not even know his face. I understand.\u201dContrary to his said understanding, he looked very upset.She thought that the subjects of the crown prince really hated Hillace very much.Psychke turned away, thinking that it was not possible to talk about Aiden anymore.\u201cLet me go, I\u2019ll walk.\u201dStrangely, however, her tongue rolled. She felt that she had been choked and her words came out with a crushed pronunciation.As she was about to roll her tongue in her mouth, wondering why she was there, Verndia let out a sigh of relief.\u201cBasically, the poison of magical beasts has the skills of causing paralysis. Fortunately, you don\u2019t seem to be seriously affected.\u201dIt was as he said. Her injured arm was still numb.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have spread that bad because I was using my ability when I was fighting, but now I can\u2019t\u2013\u201dSuddenly, a feeling of fear that was incomparable to anything before was transmitted through the ring.Oh, my.Verndia looked down at the woman in his arms.She was very agitated. To the point where the dagger injured her hand.His power entered her hand as he held the princess. He hastily made excuses.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I meant to tell you in advance. When fighting mercenaries at the auction house, I felt and knew the princess\u2019s power was leaking.\u201dPsychke\u2019s complexion turned paler when he said that he knew it right away.\u2018I\u2019ve had it.\u2019Verndia gritted his teeth.As expected from her reaction, she seems to have acted like she didn\u2019t know anything about her powers in order to survive.Her power exploded without any notice that time.However, after being silent for a long time, what was heard was an unexpected sentence.\u201cAre you going\u2026. to kill me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her hand that was holding her dagger and her vigilant eyes stayed the same.Meanwhile, Verndia, who arrived in the Lestir\u2019s carriage, climbed up with her.\u201c\u2026 What are you going to do with me?\u201dSeeing the seldom believe in Psychke, Verndia wiped his face dryly.\u201cI have no intention of killing the princess. I swear by the name of Lestir.\u201d\u201cIn what way?\u201dShe wanted to tell him not to lie in front of her. But she couldn\u2019t do that because of the vow she has with her family.Her body leaned against the wall, trembling with tension. Psychke clenched her fists that were too strong for her to bear the pain.\u201cAlright. I will tell the truth.\u201dThe Duke, and the pained expression on Verndia\u2019s face were evident, then he buried his face in his interlocking hands.\u201cActually, I have no control over my abilities.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it exists in Silkisia, but there is a sentence like this in the history of Lestir.\u201d\u300c\u201dGod\u2019s gift was nothing but a disaster to an unprepared man.Lestir, who failed to deal with its power, was gradually eaten by the flames.Without his partner, Silkisia, it would have been a riot.\u300d\u201cThe history said that. The flame in my heart is something that no human body can handle.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dPsychke fell into silence.She doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s saying all of this to her, so she doesn\u2019t know how to react at all.Since the current ability of Silkisia is vacant, should she mourn at the news that one day he will be eaten by his flames?Or should she be surprised at how powerful it is?\u201cSo, the Princess\u2019s help\u2026 I need it\u2026\u201dUnwillingly, Verndia, who had been hesitating, blurted his intentions. The word \u2018need\u2019 was hardly ever heard.\u201cYes?\u201dWhat did she hear just now? Who needs what from whom?She asked in her mind, embarrassed.As if he wanted to erase what he wanted previously, Verndia said without breath.\u201cIce that does not melt. The powers of the princess.\u201dPsychke bit her mouth. She was meant not to give him a time to correct his words.But no matter what how long she waited, Verndia didn\u2019t change his words anymore. There was not even a single break in his serious expression.\u2018If I correct the Duke\u2019s misunderstanding, will I die right here?\u2019It felt like someone was squeezing her heart. Psychke bit her lower lip hard enough that it left a mark.\u201cCan you swear only two things from my family?\u201d\u201cAs long as you tell me, I will.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, please don\u2019t tell anyone that I have powers.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that only natural?\u201d\u201cSecondly, swear you won\u2019t kill me no matter what I say.\u201d\u201cHave I not done it already?\u201dEven when asked if it was really necessary, Psychke\u2019s face was resolute. Reluctantly to her, Verndia followed her words.\u201cI\u2019ll bet on Lestir\u2019s name and protect you no matter what.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to protect me. Just don\u2019t kill me.\u201dVerndia hesitantly agreed. It was strange why she was making such a request, but he decided to give it a listen.She heard the oath, but her fear did not go away. Psychke pressed her left chest gently, and felt that even her heartbeat was thumping hard.\u201cI\u2026 my powers are not unmelting ice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVerndia, who opened his eyes narrowly, folded his arms as if urging her to continue.Psychke lowered her eyes to the floor of the carriage.\u201cAs the Duke knows, I am an adopted child. I was never a real Silkisia. Of course, the ability that only Silkisia can have is not in my possession. My ability is just\u2026\u201dAfter some thought, she licked her lips with difficulty.She thought that it was only a misunderstanding, but she had heard his secrets, so she felt compelled to reveal hers.\u201cIt\u2019s like a curse\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you think it is a curse?\u201dVerndia\u2019s voice sank low. Psychke didn\u2019t notice.\u201cBecause I can\u2019t control\u2013\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t control my flame either. So is my ability a curse too?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it that way\u2014\u201d\u201cThen the problem is solved. Anything else?\u201dShe was embarrassed that he had already laid down his conclusions and made his own decisions.But to deny that his powers is a mere curse. Psychke moved on.\u201cThe ice I have melts. So it can\u2019t be the \u2018ice that doesn\u2019t melt\u2019.\u201d\u201cThis is not a very simple issue, but let\u2019s just assume it with a simple answer. The flame I made goes out, too. So, it can\u2019t be an unquenchable flame.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean that\u2013\u201d\u201cThe strength of this ability depends on the user\u2019s will.\u201dVerndia cut her off adamantly.\u201cWith the hopes that your power will not remain \u2018melting\u2019, you can use your abilities in the future. So then, your problem has been resolved. What\u2019s next?\u201dThat\u2019s impossible, it doesn\u2019t make sense.Even if it were possible, how could he ever think of using a curse to make it unbreakable forever?Something hot erupted in her force to believe what she wanted to believe, but she endured it.There is still the last card left.The fact that Verndia is the root itself that cannot be denied.\u201cI am not my father\u2019s daughter. I\u2019ve even completed the paternity test. I am not a real Silkisia.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the princess is Logan\u2019s daughter or not. You are a \u2018real\u2019 Silkisia.\u201d\u201cDuke!\u201dThey can absolutely never have a peaceful conversation. Unable to resist, Psychke looked up.And as soon as she faced Verndia, he shut his mouth.\u201cWhat the hell did you say-\u201dFurious purple eyes blazed fiercely.Even though it wasn\u2019t directed at him, Psychke forgot to breathe because of the thickly rising madness.A horseman\u2019s voice was heard comforting the surprised horses from outside.\u201cYou really messed up a person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t figure out what to do. Psychke was silent.Verndia, who raised one corner of his mouth at an angle, said sarcastically.\u201cTwenty years ago, there is a family that went extinct on the accusation of gifting a poison needle necklace to the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know about the Leas case. And that family is Silkisia.\u201d\u201cThen do you know how the present Silkisia came into being?\u201dPsychke quietly nodded her head. Verndia laughed coldly.\u201cSo, do you know this?\u201dHe leaned his body towards her and slowly opened his lips.Then he spoke with strength, word by word, as if to forcing her to listen carefully.\u201cThe blood of the former Silkisia, who I thought was dead, was actually alive.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ?\u201d\u201cAnd that his successor is right before my eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Now, what are you\u2026.\u201dPsychke froze at his outrageous words.No way, as soon as her words reflected on her face, Verndia asked sharply.\u201cDo you think I said that without proof?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cYour ability, that\u2019s the proof. It\u2019s something that can never be done without \u2018unmelting ice\u2019 to put my flame to rest.\u201dShe felt her stomach sickening with her realization.Psychke covered her mouth with both hands.It is all nonsense.It\u2019s really absurd.\u2018But the duke was so confident -\u2018No, she can\u2019t.\u2018However-\u2018According to the Duke\u2019s words, what about her?The present Silkisia now?The moment a delusional thought came to an end.\u201cPrincess?\u201dHer eyes got blurryPsychke just fainted.***\u201cTell me. What\u2019s your name?\u201dWhere is this place?She thinks she was talking to someone. But she couldn\u2019t remember well.She couldn\u2019t see anything, so she lifted her head. Then after noticing the shine of the shoes in front of her, she suddenly bowed her head again.It shines just by being there. It was someone whom she can\u2019t see his face.Sadly, she only now realized that she was lying in front of his face in front of such a person.What was her name?No matter how much she think about it, she can\u2019t remember. Young Psychke answered with a hoarse voice.\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201dShe was afraid that the cursed \u2018her\u2019 might be regarded as ominous. So she was afraid they\u2019d leave without giving her a loaf of bread. Even so, she pressed her delicate body to the floor.\u201cStupid.\u201dAt the word stupid, she cried. But she showed no tears. She struggled and endured.He was the only one who came to the prison where no one had come.Although there was contempt in his eyes and voice he heard occasionally, she still felt good.He was everything to Psychke, who was in the prison.And she hated crying.\u201cWh, what should I do?\u201dShe was only five years old. The five years old girl, asked, holding back her tears,\u201cI will do anything. I will follow what you\u2019ll say. So-\u201d\u201cPsychke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, you are Psychke Silkisia.\u201dAt the man\u2019s nod, those who were in the prison\u2019s blind spot appeared, loosened her, and helped her stand up.As soon as she raised her face with puzzled eyes, the face of the man who saved her from the darkness was deeply engraved in her eyes.A face with a grimace, which represents his detest to her.But to Psychke, he looked like an angel. A halo appeared behind his silver hair.\u201cKeep in mind. Silkisia is the only one who accepts someone like you.\u201dHis big, rough hand reached out to her.Young Psychke slowly stretched out her hand at the first favor she had received.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Cess, Princess!\u201dAnd the moment her hand touched his hand.She was thrown out of her childhood memories.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll find a way, so rest now.\u201dBang, the door was then slammed shut.Psychke stared blankly at the closed door, before turning at her bandaged arm.He couldn\u2019t understand his behavior at all.\u2018Did I fall asleep?\u2019Her last memory was when she held Verndia\u2019s hand and when he carried her up to the room.She remembered that she asked him to put her down because she felt too burdened. After that, she couldn\u2019t remember anything else as she had fallen asleep.And now, she doesn\u2019t know when they arrived, but she herself is once again in Lestir mansion.He had even finished treating her arm.Psychke bit the soft flesh in her mouth tightly.\u2018No matter how tired he is, just how.\u2019She doesn\u2019t know why, but she was glad that the duke didn\u2019t kill her.Had it been discovered by others; she would have died while she was asleep.Moreover, their discussion didn\u2019t stop there earlier.\u2018Why are you telling me that?\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t it fair to hold on to each other\u2019s weaknesses?\u2019Verndia has revealed that he has no control over the \u2018unquenchable flame\u2019.Psychke couldn\u2019t understand.To be sure, when she found out his secret, she was relieved to think that she wasn\u2019t the only one caught up.Perhaps Verndia also spoke out to induce reassurance to her.\u2018Then why in the world are you revealing me all of this?\u2019The Verndia she knew was never, not once, like this.He was a man who would do anything for Lestir.He wasn\u2019t kind enough to take care of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s, who is merely in contractual engagement with him.He could attack Silkisia in the name of being engaged to the cursed Princess, but it could not be consumed in this way.There must be other reasons.\u2018Are you aware of the Leas case?\u2019After a long pause, he asked a strange question.She doesn\u2019t know why that was happening, but she said that she knew.\u2018Then the princess is Leas\u2019s daughter\u2026 ha, damn it.\u2019He frowned abruptly and stopped his words, then took a deep breath and brushed his head with his hand. He was like a man trying to calm his rising anger.\u2018If this goes on, I\u2019ll pass out again.\u2019He exhaled slowly, uttering incomprehensible words. He revealed the reason for revealing his secrets.\u2018It\u2019s because of the princess\u2019s ability, the ice that doesn\u2019t melt.\u2019It\u2019s ridiculous. There must have been some big misunderstanding.To remind him of this, Psychke said that her ability is not great, rather it is a curse.Then Verndia-\u2018This is the tenth time.\u2019\u2018It is precisely the tenth time that I pointed out that your ability is not a curse.\u2019He got annoyed and left the room, leaving some unknown words to her.Could it be because that she fell asleep due to exhaustion and couldn\u2019t listen to him till the end?Yes, that must be it. She doesn\u2019t know why he said that ten times without waking her up.It happened often in Silkisia, so he thought his case was a similar to it.\u2018I guess it wasn\u2019t important.\u2019Psychke stopped digging deep.It wasn\u2019t because her body felt heavy, as if she was submerged in an abyss. It also wasn\u2019t because she couldn\u2019t stop her eyelids from closing again and again.It\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t matter that Verndia behaves abnormally like he did in the past.The important thing is her curse, and he found it out. Therefore, she must leave this place as soon as possible.As if brainwashing, she whispered to herself.So-\u2018I have to run away.\u2019She fell down in attempt of getting up from her seat. She was so sick that she couldn\u2019t overcome the rush of her blood.The sky outside the window was red as it was dawning.***\u201cOh, this. A failure I couldn\u2019t kill you.\u201dThe room was so dark that only the outlines of things could be seen.A woman squatting at the edge of a huge red magic circle raised her head.A wolf was dying in front of her with its tongue sticking out. The place where the lower body was supposed to be, was empty.The charred fur had lost its original red color.\u201cAre there any more sacrifices left?\u201dThe woman who squawked as if singing glanced at the center of the magic circle.The blood of young animals, such as sheep and goats, were scattered ugly.The man following her gaze opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s put it back together.\u201d\u201cIf not now, it will be too late. Because Lestir saw the beasts.\u201dThe woman jumped up and crossed the magic circle. The sound of heels echoed through the room.The place where the hoof stopped was in front of the man outside the magic circle.Just then, the wind blew. The moonlight, which had just leaked through the clouds, poured down on the man\u2019s hair.It has a blood color, which was exactly one of the colors in the woman\u2019s dress.At the unwelcome name he heard from her, he furrowed one eyebrow.\u201cLestir?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. ah, dear me. Did I kill the wrong person? That Hillace bastard. I am sure to kill him for burning my research.\u201dThe woman sighed exaggeratedly and pulled her hair straight through her thumb and forefinger. It was a pretty pink hair.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t within range. I made that I checked it and activated it.\u201d\u201cYou can see it as a sign that your skills have become insignificant.\u201dThe man appeared to be in his mid-twenties.But the pressure in his voice was by no means his age.It had a texture like chewing sand in the desert, but the woman smirked.\u201cDon\u2019t you think the sacrifice was insignificant?\u201dThe man\u2019s fingers twitched at the woman\u2019s arrogance.The gray eyes that glistened menacingly seemed to want to strangle her.The woman didn\u2019t mind it and clasped her hands and stretched them out.\u201cIt\u2019s true. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s been a long time, but I had a hard time controlling the beasts.\u201dShe hummed an unintelligible melody as if she were trying to sublimate her struggles into a song.Then she suddenly opened her eyes.\u201cYeah, I saw that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 ?\u2019\u201cI mean. Ice!\u201dShe giggled, describing with her hands a mass of ice falling in the air, which she saw through the beast\u2019s vision.\u201cIce just spattered here and there. It froze everywhere, and chunks of ice are dripping from the air.\u201d\u201c\u2026. What?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice shook.It was a precarious atmosphere, like a lute string being pulled taut.Like an undetected person, the woman continued with a sarcastic voice.\u201cNo matter how late it was, it won\u2019t be settled within ten years, but it must have been because it was revealed late- Ugh!\u201d\u201cThe child\u2019s powers were manifested?\u201d\u201cUgh, that\u2019s right.\u201dHis strong hand gripped her slender neck. The woman gasped for air but did not show any fear.The man\u2019s eyes shook with an unknown emotion.\u201cWhen the hell\u2026 wait. The child was there?\u201d\u201cYeah, ugh, I blocked her from coming in outside the target, but how did she break through, ugh, when returning\u2026\u201d\u201cDid Lestir see?\u201d\u201cWhat, ugh, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe child\u2019s ability.\u201d\u201cHas he seen it? I think he saw it, but ugh, I couldn\u2019t see it in detail because of the fire. I even barely escaped. It hurts so please let go of me!\u201dHe was a man who would let go immediately when she said that she was hurt.But today was different.\u201cDid he see it?\u201dInstead of loosening his grip on her, he pulled her towards him, bringing her up to his eye level. His gray eyes glistened with anger.\u201cIt\u2019s because of the beasts, the reason why Lestir saw her powers. Is that right?\u201d\u201cOh, heuk, that\u2019s right. Please, let me go\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know what mess you\u2019ve done? Psychke, it\u2019s not enough that you almost killed that child, but you made her use his powers in front of Lestir?\u201d\u201cHeuk, I\u2019m really going to die like this\u2026!\u201dWhen she made an impression that she was going to die, he threw her away.A woman who collapsed violently on the floor, grabbed her neck and groaned.\u201cAh, ugh, really-\u201d\u201c\u2026. Ha.\u201dThe man who looked down at the woman annoyedly covered his eyes.He worked for over a decade to get Psychke Silkisia while avoiding Lestir\u2019s eyes.In a moment\u2019s mistake, it collapsed like a sandcastle.He wanted to kill her right away, but he couldn\u2019t because there was no one to replace her.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose, it\u2019s already happened! It\u2019s no use trying to get angry with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cHah, really. Aren\u2019t you doing too much? I also told you who ran the auction house.\u201dHadn\u2019t for her, the man wouldn\u2019t have seen the visions of the mercenaries back then. The woman grumbled.\u201cAnd I think Lestir already knew the princess\u2019s powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cThe behavior was just that. Isn\u2019t his action was somewhat someone would do if he didn\u2019t know it?\u201dThe woman explained what she had seen.A flame that was too big and strong to be dealt with the demonic beasts.Unlike before, when she controlled her powers not to leave evidence every time, the power melted even the bones of the beasts.The walls of the alleyway collapsed unnaturally.The eyes on the woman who was plucking the hem of her clothes turned to the secret note stained with blood on the desk.\u201cA pathetic bastard.\u201dIt was a reckless self-talk, but there was no one in this place who could understand her words.The woman recalled the lump of inferiority she had brought with her and her father\u2019s note and raised her red lips seductively.\u201cNow that it\u2019s like this \u2013 I think it\u2019s a secondary idea to get the princess, and I\u2019m a little more active in completing the eternal magic line. We really don\u2019t have time anymore, right?\u201dThe woman clasped her hands behind her neck muttered soothingly.\u201cYou know? The purer the blood used as a material, the higher the intellect that dwells. that it works better.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Not animals, but children?\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t even think about that. How cruel.\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes softly curved as she let out a clear laugh.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything, just prepare the ingredients, Your Majesty. I will prepare a curtain to cover the mistakes of that man.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was past noon when Psychke opened her eyes.Because of what happened, she couldn\u2019t even get up right now. Her body was engulfed in such exhaustion and woke up due to the door opening.\u201cAh, forgive me. I stopped by to see if you have woken up.\u201dHer maid, who woke her up unintentionally, was taken aback. Her freckled cheeks turned red.\u2018Was she called Cecil?\u2019The maid, called Cecil, who was assigned to attend to her during her stay in the Lestir, was the exact opposite of Melissa.Cecil takes care of her and is genuinely worried about me.\u201cMiss, are you hungry? I heard from Sir Isolet that you worked hard yesterday! Should I bring a meal to you? The menu consists of grilled lamb with parsley, broccoli soup, and\u2026 Oh! If you feel discomfort anywhere, should I bring you a cup of hot cocoa?\u201d\u201cNo, I am fine\u2014\u201d\u201cNo! Miss, you skipped breakfast already. If you don\u2019t eat again, your health will deteriorate. Nevertheless, you might change your mind when you see the food for yourself, so I\u2019ll bring it to you! Oh, by the way, the chef grinded a bunch of tomatoes that are good for relieving fatigue, and I\u2019ll bring them to you too!\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, Cecil ran out. She was in such a rush that the door wasn\u2019t even closed tightly.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe had no spirit left in her body. It was as if they flowed out like a waterfall. And as soon as she woke up, she forgot that she had tried running away.Psychke blankly looked at the door.\u2018I think she\u2019s about the same age as Melissa. So how are they so different?\u2019And it wasn\u2019t only Cecil who was like that to her.Even though it was only the third day, the overall mood of the Lestir employees was not comparable to that of Silkisia.The employees didn\u2019t care about her being the fake princess.\u2018If I was recognized as a real princess, what would it feel like?\u2019She wasn\u2019t used to being treated sweetly. All of this was possible since she was still Verndia\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and this is just an illusion that will soon fade away.As she thought so, she rein in her desire to loosen up. She patted her cheek to wake her up.But betraying her will, her body slowly leaned towards her bed.In fact, it was a miracle that she didn\u2019t die by the hands of the beasts yesterday.Even if I took the doctor\u2019s medicine, the fatigue accumulated at the auction did not go away.\u2018I need to calm down\u2026 but\u2026\u2019With her grip on the blanket, Psychke nodded and began to doze off.Her tormented body is wrapped around soft stuff. Even if she felt uncomfortable, she doesn\u2019t have the talent to step down.\u201cWhy is the door open\u2026 creak. Oh, forgive me.\u201dIsolet, who was about to come in, was startled. Since Psychke was already awake when he came in, she asked him.\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d\u201cUh, that\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t go out or come in, and he was sweating profusely. His gaze was fixed on his feet.\u201cIs there any problem?\u201d\u201cYour clothes\u2026\u201dPsychke looked down at what she was wearing.Maybe Cecil changed them while she was sleeping, and it was just plain pajamas that noble girls would wear.She wanted to know what was wrong, but she placed a robe to cover her pajamas.It was then that Isolet saw her.His face, which had always been exhausted, looked even more tired because of the alley bombing.Psychke immediately spit out the words that came to her mind.\u201cI think you should take a vacation.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201dIsolet, who was greatly moved by the word vacation, lamented.\u201cPrincess, do you know how much I suffered last night? The Duke should have waited for a wagon to arrive. Or he should have sent a notice to send a wagon over there? What am I supposed to do when he abruptly went away alone at dawn\u2014\u201dHe grumbled that he thought he was going to die because he had been walking a long distance since dawn.\u201cIt\u2019s the same with alleyways. Hah, but this is a secret, but the duke was deeply worried that the princess you\u2019d be arriving late.\u201d\u201cWor\u2026. ried?\u201d\u201cYes. So he went to pick the Princess\u2026 and who would have thought that he would bomb the alley down?\u201dIsolet raved about how tedious he was to fill out his report.\u201cIf he was that bored, he should have held it in and didn\u2019t smash the alley down.\u201d\u201cYou suffered.\u201d(TN: LOL, why did I find this funny?)Psychke sincerely comforted him, who seemed to have a lot of things piled up.The butler mumbled sadly, saying that the Duke should understand his suffering, then lowered his voice abruptly.\u201cBut, is that even true? A monster in the middle of the capital. This is a matter of believing or not\u2014\u201dHe made an absurd excuse in order to fill his report and it must have been the full story to his closest confidant.Psychke corrected what he had misunderstood.\u201cIt\u2019s not a monster, it\u2019s a beast.\u201d\u201cAh, it must have been a beast. It\u2019s because the names are similar, so it\u2019s always confusing. It\u2019s a naturally occurring monster, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI get scolded every day, but I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t memorize it. By the way, are you okay with your injury? I\u2019m so glad it ended that way.\u201dJudging, it seemed that no one told Isolet that she had fought the beast directly.She is, after all, rumored to be an incompetent princess, so even if she tells the truth, no one will believe her.Psychke nodded her head roughly.\u201cI should have been a better butler. Ah, I really have no face to show in front of you again, Princess.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThe duke cursed me a lot when I left you alone. I thought I was finally getting fired.\u201d\u201c\u2026. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. What does the princess have to apologize for? It was my fault for not following orders.\u201dIsolet waved his hand frantically. The teddy bear and the rabbit doll, which were held in his hand, which children could play with, shook together.\u2018What is that\u2026\u2019Psychke\u2019s eyes focused on the doll.Isolet, who noticed that gaze, said, \u201cOh,\u201d and explained the real purpose of coming here.\u201cDo you like rabbits or bears?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cOr do you like something else?\u201dShe looked at Isolet\u2019s face, wondering what this meant.He was as serious as a soldier going to war choosing a weapon.\u201cThere are foxes, there are squirrels, there are ducks\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026. Are you talking about dolls?\u201d\u201cYes. If you tell me what kind you like, I will give it consideration as much as possible.\u201d\u201cConsideration?\u201dPsychke had a puzzled expression on her face. Isolet, who was unconsciously trying to tell the truth, bit his tongue.\u201cPrincess\u2026 No, I have a female customer. She has to give the guest a present.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I just want to ask for help from you. Princess, do you like teddy bears or rabbit dolls?\u201dWas there a little girl in Lestir who could come as a guest? Why is he asking her those kinds of things? Psychke shook her head.\u201cI don\u2019t like dolls, so I can\u2019t say anything about them.\u201d\u201cSorry but I can\u2019t help you with that sort.\u201d\u201cHow, I\u2019ve already ordered different types\u2026 Then what does the princess like?\u201dPsychke did not readily answer the question she had heard for the first time in her life. What does she like?\u2018What do I like?\u2019\u201cI brought you a meal, Princess!\u201dJust then, Cecil showed up, pulling the tray. In Silkisia, if this was the case, she could only tase this smell if there was a feast or celebration.Even then, Cecil grumbled that the tray was small and had no choice but to bring it.\u201cPlease eat it before it gets cold.\u201dCecil handed her a warm mug. The sweet scent of cocoa wafted up and tickled the tip of her nose.In constant urging, Psychke wet her lips with cocoa.It was yummy.What she ate now was the tastiest than any drink she had ever drank.She held the sweet liquid in her mouth and swallowed it only when it was lukewarm.And she opened her mouth which smells like the cocoa she is drinking.\u201cIt\u2019s a sword. I think I like swords.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 There is no such thing here. I am doomed.\u201dWith words she couldn\u2019t understand, Isolet ran away.But Psychke was so obsessed with cocoa that she didn\u2019t even realize he was out.The cocoa was warm.***After a late meal, it was around sunset already.If she kept lying down, it would feel like time stayed still. So, she forced herself to stand up and go outside.Her whole body ached from the poison of the beast that remained in her body. Her bandaged arm was numb as if she had been electrocuted.Rubbing her arm with the opposite hand, Psychke headed towards Verndia\u2019s office.\u2018I can\u2019t run away until we\u2019re not engaged.\u2019She forgot. As long as he has the ring, she can\u2019t leave him. The idea of escaping was impossible as long as their location is shared through the rings.\u2018I don\u2019t know why he saved me, but I have to end this soon before he changes his mind.\u2019(TN: Bro, he had changed his mind already.)Lia had to report what happened at the auction house and get compensation.She had to prove to Verndia that demons could be dealt with even without the Imperial Knights.\u2018It\u2019s too late today, so I\u2019m going to the Magic Association tomorrow\u2014\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d\u201cWhere are you going? I haven\u2019t finished my story yet!\u201dBang! The door to the office a few steps away roared open. Surprised, Psychke stopped walking.\u201cOh, why are you here?\u201dThe girl who saw Psychke rushed to run. Her cute pink ponytail fluttered as she ran.\u201cSo you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cHello, Miss Lia. I\u2019m staying here for a while for some reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dLia, who greeted her warmly, stiffened her face.At the instantaneously chilling temperature, Psychke misunderstood that this place was not in Lestir, but in a field in the middle of winter. And the cold got worse after Lia found a bandage wrapped around her arm.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI am all alright.\u201dAn invisible spark bounced between the two of them.Her flesh shrank from the cold. As she opened her mouth, her white breath leaked out.Lia, who confirmed Psychke\u2019s condition at Verndia\u2019s during a snowball fight, collected Mana.She took Psychke\u2019s hand, still frowning.\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, so wait for me.\u201dAlbeit that Verndia was chasing after them, Lia had led Psychke out of the Duke\u2019s residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was clear that she was mad about something.\u201cWhy is my dear staying at that house?\u201d\u201cBecause I have work.\u201dPsychke didn\u2019t feel the need to explain in detail to someone she wasn\u2019t even close to. She had only seen Lia once. Besides, she didn\u2019t understand why she was being so friendly.When Psychke showed no sign of answering, Lia deeply exhaled.\u201cMy dear, why does it has to be in Lestir\u2026 he\u2019s hopeless. He must have a plan based on his cunning personality.\u201d\u2013 Kaaacck!The crow sitting on Psychke\u2019s shoulder roared dissatisfied at how Lia sees her master.It wasn\u2019t the crow that talked (?) to Verndia last night. That one had yellow eyes and this one has crimson eyes.They looked alike so they must be twins.\u2018Did he say this crow\u2019s name is Croa?\u2019That was the name that was given by Verndia. Usually, these names were given to an escort Knight, so Psychke thought of it as a joke.This crow unfortunately became a knight.Psychke could say that this pitiful crow is used for surveillance.\u201cAiyu, I am afraid I am not already a kid! Look, my voice is too big for a child\u2019s.\u201d\u2013\u00a0 Kaaack! Kaaack! Kaack!\u201cHey, bird head. If you\u2019re here to escort, shut your mouth and only escort.\u201d\u2013 Kaaack!Psychke guesses that these two were talking but she doesn\u2019t know how.\u2018Noisy.\u2019She got a headache due to extreme noise near her ears. Psychke let out a painful groan.\u201cYou\u2019re not being threatened there in the Duke\u2019s residence, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll leave as soon as I found another place to stay.\u201d\u201cThen will you come to my house?\u201d\u201cThanks for the suggestion, but that\u2019s fine.\u201dHaving Verndia wasn\u2019t at all comfortable, but she needs to save face for the sake of Lestir, and she\u2019d be better off staying in Lestir to end her breakup quickly. Lia frowned at her resolute refusal.\u201cLestir is really a no-no though.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201dPsychke knew it too. That Verndia is someone impossible to ask her to stay in his residence with pure heart.She shifted the topic as she didn\u2019t want to continue conversing about the current one.Lia explained to her while making a groaning, painful sound.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bombed alleyway. I\u2019m trying to find out who used the forbidden magic.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cYes. Every magic has its own unique wavelength.\u201dHowever, the waves usually disappear within half a day. In the case of today, Lia grumbled, saying that some might have remained there even after a lot of time had passed.\u201cBy the way-\u201cLia extended her ponytail and tilted her head slightly at her. She looked into Psychke\u2019s eyes and asked.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cWhy am I so interested in forbidden magic?\u201dPsychke slightly stuttered.\u201cI just thought it would be rude.\u201dThose who explored forbidden magic, who are also so-called worshipers of forbidden magic, were dangerous in a sense.And Psychke didn\u2019t want to associate with them. So, she pretended not to see nor hear them at all.\u201cWhat? No, no, no. If you ask me, I will definitely answer you. It\u2019s simply suspicious. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dLia softly laughed.Psychke had no choice but to ask, as Lia\u2019s tenacious and serious gaze seemed to have coerced her.\u201cWhy do you know so well?\u201d\u201cI studied.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs expected.She indeed said that she would answer but she never told that it would be in detail.\u201cDon\u2019t make that face. Well, first of all, I\u2019m not one of those so-called worshipers. I may not look like that, but I am not a kid anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you look at me like that, it hurts me. Think about it. Why would a person like me worship something like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat makes sense.One saw the end of the freezing magic, the other the tip of the sword.There was no reason to reach out to other fields just to gain new strength.\u201cAnd I am not really interested. That man is more interested than me.\u201d\u201cThe duke?\u201dAgain, this was surprising. A person who is not a wizard is so interested in forbidden magic?\u2018So what Aiden said was true.\u2019\u201cYes. I am also asking him to know what happened. So, there\u2019s no need for you to report it to the Magic Association. Alright?\u201dIt turned out that Lia is scared of being reported to the Magic Association.There must be something wrong with being a great wizard.As she looked into her eyes, Psychke laughed involuntarily.\u201cYes, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cJust because.\u201dCroa on her shoulder also clapped her beak and smirked.Lia glared at the crow with a dreadful look.\u201cOh, right, the auction house. I couldn\u2019t get the necklace. And the Duke got the fake\u2014\u201d\u201cAh, I know. This baby has been informed. I guess you haven\u2019t heard, right?\u201dPsychke wondered when Lia went there to get information, but she felt that it was a relief.She\u2019ll just ask her about it once they get back.As they continued their conversation, they ended up in the alleyway.The unrecognizable ashes have long been cleaned up by someone.A few onlookers who received the news late were looking at the charred fragments of the wall.\u201cWow, geez, really. I heard it, but I can\u2019t get the words out. If you want to catch it, you have to hold it finely. Why do you break the wall?\u201d\u201cWow, look, really. I\u2019ve heard of what he did, but I am still speechless. If he wants to save you, why does he have to break the alley?\u201dThe grumpy Lia stepped forward, grimacing the back of her nose and sniffling.\u201cThere seems to be a little left. I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201dTo check, Lia put her hand on the shards on the floor and closed her eyes. She asked Psychke a favor before concentrating.\u201cIf anything happens, shake me, and let me know. When I am focused, I am not aware of my surroundings.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dPsychke agreed. Then, she turned her head to the gaze of the onlookers she felt from a distance.\u201cOh, look over there.\u201d\u201cWizard \u2026.\u201d\u201cPrincess\u2026\u201dThere were murmuring voices. Since they were far from her, she couldn\u2019t hear what they were talking about in detail.In the meantime, a whispered sentence reached her ear.\u201cDuke Lestir did that? Why did he do that near the Silkisia?\u201dShe understands now.Psychke immediately understood.It wasn\u2019t only for a day or two that Silkisia and Lestir had a bad relationship.And for some reason, Verndia blew up an alley near Silkisia in the middle of the night.It was the perfect condition to ignite more rumors.\u2018Butler, you should really take a vacation.\u2019She was in the midst of mourning for Islet\u2019s murderous work, guessing from the rumors that were circulating.\u2018Those people, do they know that I am out of the house?\u2019She suddenly wondered.Her brothers and her father, who obviously value the reputation of the family, would have not been the ones to spread the rumors.Lillian and Lenox were different. Lilian has already told Hilvia a fake rumor.Hilvia, who pursues dramatic things, will keep herself low-key and explode like a bomb on the Second Prince\u2019s banquet day.And Lenox,\u201cHow are you?\u201dShe thinks he has no brain in his head\u2014\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dWhatever happens, he still came here.Lenox put his hands into his pockets and approached her.Behind him were two soldiers who were very nervous when they saw Psychke.\u201cYou go out on your own and come back. Are you waiting for me?\u201dLenox was one of those who did not believe the rumors which said that Psychke had beaten Aiden.He thinks that two soldiers are enough to defeat a weak sister, like Psychke.He thought so. Which is why he couldn\u2019t understand why his father was troubled.\u201cWhy, after having a fight with the duke, you regained your senses?\u201dPsychke noticed that he misunderstood.He seemed to think that the bombing last night started because of her.\u2018Does he think I had a fight with the Duke?\u2019She then wondered what kind of intense fight would it be to even blow up the alleyways.Unfortunately, if it was the crazy dog of the north, Verndia, he would be enough.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, but the Duke\u2019s crazy too. How were your eyes? I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s taking care of you. Well, it looks like you\u2019re back to normal now.\u201d\u2013 KkaackThe angry crow wept loudly at the reproach of its master. It flapped its wings menacingly as if it was about to run away.But Lenox didn\u2019t even pay attention.\u201cBut what to do? There is no place for you in Silkisia anymore.\u201dLenox, who touched his nose, slyly smiled, and touched her cheek.Psychke slapped his hand with contempt.\u201cI do not need it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sitting pretty while lying, ha. Then why are you here?\u201dLenox glanced at Psychke from top to bottom as if he was mocking her.\u201cI am a generous person. So I\u2019ll let this slide for once.\u201d(TN: Bruh?)\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cWhat-?\u201dLenox, startled, widened his eyes. He stared at Psychke\u2019s cold face, then raised the corners of his mouth.\u201c\u2026. Haa. Things have been quiet because of you.\u201dLenox raised his hand. As always, they use violence to deal with things.Lenox couldn\u2019t even fight against Verndia. Seeing that someone who looked weaker than her could easily raise his hand made her laugh.\u2018Should I avoid it?\u2019It was an incredibly slow move.He was so slow that she could easily avoid it by tilting her neck.However, there were a lot of onlookers around them watching them.My father must have told him to bring her quietly without attracting attention. Because there\u2019s nothing good about being caught in a domestic dispute.Psychke made up her mind.As she confidently looked at Lenox, she murmured to the crow.\u201cStay still.\u201dLenox was stunned by his sister\u2019s intense gaze. But he clenched his teeth to ignore it.Pak!A sharp palm slapped her cheek. Her head turned to one side. She felt a scratch on her cheek.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cDid you just see it?\u201d\u201cOh my gosh!\u201dThe sound of onlookers gasping for breath seemed to be heard all the way up to here.Not bad.\u201cWell done.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you crazy\u2014\u201dShe straightened her head and slapped Lenox on the cheek.(TN: You just met the underworld, Lenox. Welcome~)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lenox\u2019s head was bent awkwardly. He couldn\u2019t avoid the speed from Psychke.\u201cYou! You!\u201dThwack! Lenox\u2019s head turned to the opposite side with a light sound.\u201cDon\u2019t talk impolitely to me.\u201d\u201cThi, this crazy bitch\u2014!\u201dThawck! His head turned to the other side once again.(TN: Oh no, no, no, no, no~ )\u201cDon\u2019t even curse at me.\u201d\u201cTh, this is really, eook!\u201dThwack! Repeated, his head turned to the other side for the fourth time. Lenox lost the strength in his legs. He staggered backwards and barely stood up. He pointed at her with his trembling hand.\u201cYou.. You\u2026!\u201d(TN: Yaezz, she slayed it. Right, Lenox? Uwu~)\u201cHow long did you think I\u2019d tolerate you?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t like violence. At all.But in this world, there are people who don\u2019t know what wrecked behavior they are displaying unless she gave the same.\u201cThis person\u2026.!\u201dLenox took a deep breath with his reddened face. Then, as the soldiers, who came to their senses later, grabbed Psychke\u2019s arm to limit her, and Lenox shouted.\u201cThat person, right now, this instant, take her away! Just put her away\u2026. And see how I kill you!\u201d\u201cYour head still doesn\u2019t seem to understand the situation.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what father demanded you to do? Bring me as quietly as possible. Make sure you avoid people\u2019s eyes without creating any commotion.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Keuk!\u201dPsychke tripped over the foot of her brother, who rushed forward. From afar, it looked like he slipped on his own.Lenox came into his senses when he faced the floor and screamed.\u201cY, you motherf**ker. Do you want to die?! If you don\u2019t move away right now, ahhh!\u201dWhile the soldiers were perplexed as to what to do, she firmly stepped on Lenox\u2019s hand.That alone made Lenox shout out to her to go away.\u201cDo something to her, you bastards!\u201dUnfortunately for him, the soldiers were not actively moving. They were frozen.Even if she ran away from home, Psychke was still a princess. Rumors would spread if they suppressed her with force in front of others.Well, it is already impossible from the start.\u201cWhat a stain in the reputation of Silkisia. It was said that feigning ignorance is somewhat bravery but what is on that street?\u201d\u201cBut if that was me, I would be angry, too.\u201d\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be angry when they were suddenly slapped in the face? There\u2019s even swearing\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this why Duke Lenox is being beaten?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you watching?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026 too unilateral to say that.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re watching. He ran but fell.\u201dThe eyes of the onlookers were intensely attached. But it wasn\u2019t unpleasant. Psychke hoped they would spread this far away.Only then will everyone know the true nature of filthy Silkisia.\u201cIt would be good to remember this moment clearly. That is he doesn\u2019t want to get beaten like this again.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, you crazy b*tch! As soon as I get back I- ah, ah, ah!\u201dWith a sign of him about to become ferocious again, she stomped on Lenox\u2019s hand tightly, avoiding the restraints of the soldiers.\u201cThen don\u2019t remember.\u201dShe lifted her feet for the last time as she stepped hard enough to leave a mark.\u201cTake him.\u201dThe soldiers, who had heard her, released her hands only after they were assured that she would not hit Lenox anymore. And supported Lenox, who had fallen like a frog.\u201cLet me go! You damn bastards! Take that b*tch instead of me!\u201dHis cheeks were swollen, and his face, which was messed up with saliva and tears, was pleasing to see.Then, when she was about to frown and avert her eyes, she heard,\u201cYou are really dead! If father and brother knew about this\u2026 heeubp!\u201dLenox\u2019s mouth was blocked by a block of ice and a plant stem.\u201cAh, really. My head hurts like crazy but why are you overreacting like this?\u201dPsychke looked at the source of the voice. Lia, who had finished concentrating, was pressing her temples with a frown on her face.\u2018The ice must be from Lia\u2019s.\u2019So whose magic is this plant stem?The question was immediately resolved by the sound of exclamation that followed.\u201cOh my God \u2013 I was wondering what kind of fuss this was in front of the great Silkisia. Are you the second Duke of Silkisia?\u201dThe woman who reached out one hand to Lenox was smiling brightly.She had pink hair that reached down to her chest, and she wore a red dress that was fit to her body.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the Duke, who was said to be brilliant, would be so ignorant. Isn\u2019t that right, Princess?\u201dHer playful eyes were softly curved. And half of her orange eyes were covered with her eyelids.She thinks it was her first time seeing her. But why are they being so intimate?Psychke raised her vigilance.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are we meeting for the first time? You didn\u2019t know me? I see. Nice to meet you, princess. I\u2019m Shiona Tzuberj-\u201d\u201cGet lost.\u201dLia suddenly came closer to her, grabbed her hand and pulled her away. The girl\u2019s face was distorted at the sight between them.Psychke was taken away by accident. Then she looked behind her at the voice that followed her flawlessly.\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other often, Princess.\u201dWith an alluring smile, Shiona waved her hand.***\u201cI\u2019m afraid I need to change my hair color.\u201dLia was quiet for a while but then spoke.\u201cI get annoyed every time I see it. Why does she have the same color as mine?\u201dFor about ten minutes or so after that, Lia talked only about Shiona.Her main content was that just making eye contact with her was creepy and unpleasant.Psychke thought of Shiona\u2019s face.\u2018She looks strange but her words weren\u2019t really offensive.\u2019\u201cIgnore the people we meet next time. You\u2019re dealing with them for nothing. What were those for?\u201dLia was surprised to find the nail marks on her cheeks.To get a closer look at her, Psychke turned away from her, who wanted to take a closer look, and covered her cheek with her palm.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing! Who is it, who hit you?\u201dPsychke didn\u2019t answer.Lia, in anger, pointed at Croa as if it was the crow as the culprit.\u201cHey, bird head! What did you do? You\u2019re not really a guard! Did you even change into a real bird head?\u201d\u2013 Kaack! Kaack!\u201cWho did this to you? Oh?\u201d\u201cI told you to stay still.\u201d\u2013 Kaack! Kaack!\u201cWhat? why?\u201dAgain Psychke did not open her mouth. At that moment, Lia clenched her fist as much as possible.\u201cI thought I needed to freeze that man\u2019s head.\u201d\u201cDid you check the wavelength?\u201dPsychke turned away, not wanting to talk about what happened anymore.Lia glared at the crow for a long time before turning her face toward Psychke.\u201cI did, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Pardon?\u201d\u201cI found the wave, but I don\u2019t know who did it.\u201dCan one wizard know the wavelength of all wizards?There were about a hundred wizards who belonged to the association, and there were probably many more wizards who did not belong to them.As if Lia had read what was in her mind, she added.\u201cCan it be said that the mastermind is not a human being at all?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that because it\u2019s forbidden magic?\u201d\u201cNo. Forbidden magic. Since it\u2019s forbidden magic, everyone thought it was amazing..\u201dLia shrugged her shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s just like any other magic except that it drains life instead of mana. Well, it works really well.\u201dShe further explained that forbidden magic is about ten times more effective than normal magic.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a long time has passed; what item did they use? Were there any items that could hide the wave?\u201dLia mumbled, saying that what she had seen had been saved in her head so she needn\u2019t go back to analyze.\u201cAre you afraid to ask the Imperial family for cooperation?\u201d\u201cImperial Family?\u201dLia looked at her ready to hear all her dad jokes.\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere and say something like that. That\u2019s a big suggestion.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell the imperial family you\u2019ve seen forbidden magic.\u201dPsychke was bewildered and blinked her eyes.\u201cMy dear. You know that you met \u2018real beasts\u2019 yesterday, right?\u201d\u201cYes. So, shouldn\u2019t I say more?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think they would think of you if you said you survived even if you ran into a real beast?\u201dPsychke immediately understood. She was known in the world as a helpless and weak Princess. She didn\u2019t know if she would be dismissed as a lie, or, in worse case she might be swamped with questions.However\u2026\u2026.\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough to say that the Duke found me? Since he is the master of the unquenchable flame of the Sword Master, it would not be strange if I said that he handled the matter himself.\u201d\u201cIf that kiddo got in the Imperial Family.. uhm. Better to hear this from him yourself. It\u2019s not something I can say.\u201dLia gently shook her head.\u201cAnyway, yes. Nothing good will happen.\u201d\u201cThen what should I do?\u201dAt Psychke\u2019s hesitant question, Lia gave her a puzzled expression.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAs for the beasts. I was the target. If I can\u2019t even ask the Imperial Family for help, what should I do in the future?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure? Maybe not?\u201dLia tilted her head to one side.\u201cI think you just got caught on the road because you were unlucky? Why? Do you hold a grudge against someone?\u201d\u2026. That is?Isn\u2019t the scale too large to say that she was caught by unfortunate luck?In an instant, Lilian\u2019s face flashed through her mind.However, the forbidden magic was not easily accessible to ordinary people. Even if one knows how or not.\u201cIt is said that a barrier was put in place to prevent anyone from entering.\u201d\u201cBarrier? Ah, there was something like the wavelength of an artifact mixed in, so there was something like that. I guess that was it.\u201dLia crossed her arms like someone thinking about something and looked into the empty space.\u201cIt was said that it looked like it was made with forbidden magic and not artifacts.\u201d\u201cEh, who did so? That kiddo?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat guy didn\u2019t. But have you heard him say that?\u201d\u201cNo, he has heard it.\u201d\u201cFrom who?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Someone he knows.\u201dHe is called Aiden. Psychke frowned slightly.Why did he tell such a lie when he knew? Not making barriers with forbidden magic. Why would he do something else to waste his vitality?\u201dLia informed her that the degree of barrier can be any number of artifacts.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t think you are.\u201dStill, when Psychke\u2019s depths could not be lifted, Lia added comfort.\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s real? Both you and that kid would have just passed the physical barrier. The problem was if there were other people besides you.\u201d\u201cWhat passed through\u2026 yes?\u201d\u201cA barrier made of artifacts doesn\u2019t break unless you destroy them. But there were no artifacts in the scene. So\u2014 what, what\u2019s wrong with your expression?\u201d\u201cThere was.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere were other people besides me and the Duke.\u201dAiden Hillace.He was the real target of the beasts.\u201cI will go back.\u201dLia\u2019s face hardened and she started running madly towards somewhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lia had asked her to leave the matter alone, but he couldn\u2019t just rest her mind after knowing that her life was already in danger.\u2018Is there no way?\u2019She wanted to tell him to be careful but she had no way to contact him.I know where he is, but I isolated him from his father. I won\u2019t be staying there since. She knew that Hillace was there in the mansion, but her father must have confined him inside. Since she wouldn\u2019t be staying there.\u2018Maybe\u2026 the Duke knows.\u2019\u201cIf you\u2019re not going in, what are you going outside?\u201dDue to her own thoughts, she didn\u2019t even realize that her feet had stopped moving on itself.Psychke was startled at his appearance and turned her back. She didn\u2019t know where he had been, but Verndia was wearing his outer clothes and staring at her blankly.He is here. His shadow created by the yellow light came closer.\u201cHmm? Why are your cheeks like that?\u201d\u201cAh, this one.\u201dShe stopped by the pharmacy but forgot to put the medicine on them. she hurriedly covered her cheeks, embarrassed.Verndia, who put her hand away, wrinkled his face.\u201cWho did this?\u201d\u201c\u2026. This is not something a Duke like you should worry about.\u201d\u201cWho cares about that now?\u201dThe ferocious voice rose sharply.\u201cWhat did I do to the Princess, tsk, nevermind.\u201dVerndia, who grabbed her hand, which was trying to cover herself, caressed the area around her wound. It was a touch as if he was caressing a fragile and very precious thing.They were too close. The heat which was transmitted from within rose through her cheeks. She lowered her gaze.\u201cI asked who did this.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026.. Okay. You were there.\u201dIn an instant, the surrounding air cooled down. She wondered if the warmth on her cheek was going away, but it was quite a bit kwaaak! A squeaking sound was heard.She opened her eyes in surprise. She saw Verndia glaring at the poor Crow, who was caught while squawking.\u201cWhat did you do? Did you even keep your eyes on her?\u201d\u2013 Kaack! Kaaack!\u201cI told you to stay still!\u201dIn spite of Psychke\u2019s plea, Verndia stared at her crow as if going to eat it, and released it only after he informed the crow that it was the culprit.A few of her black feathers flew through the air. Croa flew away.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry to show you the ugly side of me.\u201dReally, that was embarrassing. Even though she doubts if she still has emotions left because of Silkisia.Embarrassed to see him, she looked down at a distance.Verndia carefully wiped her scarred cheek with the back of his hand, then he let out a shallow sigh.\u201cIs there anything the princess would be sorry about? Let\u2019s go get some treatment.\u201dHe took her hand without hesitation and dragged her away. As she was more embarrassed, Psychke flicked her fingers, Verndia murmured in an angry voice.\u201cI should have blown it away.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNo. Why do you get hurt everytime you go out?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cAnnoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll give you the medicine.\u201dHe stopped his tracks and faced her.\u201cJust how do you see me, Princess?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know why, but it was a ribbed voice coming from him.Psychke closed her mouth for a moment, then spoke softly.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you for the treatment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201dVerndia ruffled his hair wildly.Psychke pondered what might have offended him, and she made a voice that was not confident.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you for the room. If that won\u2019t be enough, even chores\u2014\u201d\u201cDo I look like such a petty person to you, Princess?\u201dTo put it bluntly, the answer was \u2018no\u2019.She had been through so much, so she could see that he was talking about the repairing of the alleyway caused by yesterday\u2026.However, it was not known whether the spending would spread to her fianc\u00e9e, who was about to break up her marriage with him.The man who interpreted silence as a yes got annoyed.\u201cWhere are you looking?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know you\u2019re not generous enough to spend money for something you needn\u2019t.\u201dShe forcibly responded to his persistent gaze.Verndia\u2019s expression softened slightly.\u201cYou know it well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if the things I brought with me will solve it, but if it\u2019s not enough, please tell me. I\u2019ll figure out what I can\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy is the story like that again?\u201dIn his purple eyes, the flame which seemed to have been extinguished grew stronger again.\u201cWho asked for money from you?\u201d\u201cIt means that I\u2019ll give it to you because you used it where you didn\u2019t need to do so.\u201d\u201cWhy does the princess decide whether it is necessary or not?\u201dIn an instant, a deep wound soaked into his blue eyes.Psychke took her hand away from Verndia.\u201cThe Duke\u2019s words means that it is in your interest I am in Lestir.\u201dIt was a word with many meanings.And Verndia immediately understood the meaning.\u2018I\u2019m no longer doing anything other than keeping the Duke of Verndia tied, am I not?\u2019\u201cWhat potential did you see in me, Duke?\u201dHer eyes fluttered as she took a step back.It was only for a brief moment but her voice was cry, Verndia thought.\u201cIs it because of my cursed ability? So, you helped me get out of Silkisia?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dVerndia replied with a firm short word. Psychke did not believe him.\u201cThen why are you helping me?\u201dIt was neither sympathy nor affection. She doesn\u2019t believe in anything like that.Like Silkisia, this man must have discovered her \u2018Potential as a Tool\u2019.So he must be helping her for his own gains.Her last in Silkisia was death after hellish confinement.What would be her end if she was with this man?Psychke glanced at the distance to the front door. Noticing her thoughts, Verndia raised his hands.It meant he had no intention of attacking her or the sorts.\u201cIf you want to go, go. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d\u201cYou can track my location anyways?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you trust people like this?\u201dVerndia unleashed the sword from his waist and threw it at her, despite his irritation.A large sapphire centering on a handle with dozens of amethysts.It was a sword that symbolized Lestir.\u201cIf you\u2019re anxious, hold on to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cAre you ready to talk to me now?\u201dAs she didn\u2019t hold the sword and looked down, Verndia asked bluntly.Psychke looked at him once, and the sword curled up on the floor once.\u201cThe duke\u2026 is the only one who can use this.\u201d\u201cI gave permission, so even the Princess can use it.\u201dWith a ferocious expression on his face, Verndia touched his forehead.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll stop. But I\u2019ll be honest here. Yes, it\u2019s true that it helps me that the Princess is here in Lestir.\u201dPsychke\u2019s eyes widened.Before she could run away, Verndia quickly added her back.\u201cBut I am not helping the Princess to have gains. I am helping the princess\u2026\u201dHe was speechless right after. Verndia sighed uncontrollably.He knew that she was the master of \u2018Unmelting Ice.\u2019 He thought so he could keep her by his side.That was it.\u2026 Is that all?\u2018Why am I helping the princess?\u2019He was bewildered. If he didn\u2019t like the ability she managed to find albeit that it had disappeared, he could have tied her up.If that was, then he\u2019d be doing the same as Silkisia did; breaking her wing and suppressing her.The breakup of their engagement?Even the fact that such a contract existed disappears from this world if he would only shut her mouth.It was the easiest way for a person with the power after the emperor and the most powerful of the empire.But he refused to do so. He hated walking down that road.He didn\u2019t know why.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201dVerndia pursed his lips, trying to spit out his thoughts as clearly as usual.But he didn\u2019t do well.So he squeezed only the sentences he could complete right now from the tip of his throat.\u201cI want to postpone the breakup.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Pardon?\u201dAt that moment, Psychke felt that her heart froze because of his nonsense.Psychke looked at him blankly. And with a serious expression on his face, she realized he wasn\u2019t joking.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf you break your marriage with me, the princess will probably go to a place no one knows about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026! How did you\u2014\u201d\u201cI wish you won\u2019t do that. If I can\u2019t see her, I think I\u2019d be a little frustrated.\u201dHe looked in a tight spot, like someone who was talking about someone\u2019s feelings that he couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke, but I\u2014\u201dPsychke, whose face changed from moment to moment, had her lips tremble.Her face turned pale in an unexpected situation, having no idea how can she go through this.\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay engaged to the Duke\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I won\u2019t break the marriage.\u201dVerndia asserted.\u201cAccording to the contract, I will break the marriage the day the demons disappear. Because of this, we will not delay dealing with monsters.\u201dVerndia approached her just as far as she had gone from him and bowed his head.His silver bangs fluttered. Although she was greeted from the warm breath from him above, she did not step back.\u201cIt\u2019s just what I am hoping for.\u201d\u201cNo coercion or anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you embarrassed?\u201dEven if she didn\u2019t answer aloud, he could tell just by looking at her face.Verndia let out a short breath.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can only say this to the question of why I am helping you.\u201dHe carefully lifted one of Psychke\u2019s hands.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t even know.\u201dHe had never done this before. He laughed awkwardly.\u201cBut one thing is certain. That I have no intention of using Princess as my tool.\u201dTool.Psychke\u2019s body trembled at the cold words she heard. But the tremor melted away like snow melted by the warmth of the back from his hand.Verndia, who kissed the back of her palm as a sign of respect, slightly raised his face.\u201cCan you explain a little bit now?\u201dThe back of her hand tickled by the touch of his lips.Psychke said nothing in return.(TN: Hear me out\u2026. The thing is, Verndia has \u2018Silver Hair\u2019 but for the second cover of this novel, the man leaning on Psychke\u2019s lap has \u2018Black Hair\u2019, then who has Black Hair?

You know everything!\u201dLia unleashed her appearance-changing magic when she wanted the mana in the atmosphere to shake wildly.She meant that she would fight against him if that was his plan.Verndia still did not uncross his legs.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cStart talking.\u201d\u201cI told you to sit down.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cIlia.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me by that name.\u201d\u201cThen why do you care about the princess?\u201dDespite the question that seemed to have slapped her in the face, Lia only stared at him, unmoving.With her elegance that didn\u2019t fit her mood, Verndia picked up the teacup.\u201cI do not intend to use her.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Then why did you bring her here?\u201d\u201cIf that was my motive, I would have told her to stop taking the medicine from the very start.\u201dVerndia stared at the medicine bag, which Lia had thrown haphazardly on the glass table.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Because I can\u2019t even use her.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too attractive, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201dVerndia smiled brightly.Although it wasn\u2019t only for a few times that he felt Psychke\u2019s power, each time he had to suppress his desire to take her by force.(TN: Just take her by force and give us some details *blush, blush*It was similar to a person who starved for a week and put up with food in front of them.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little annoying. I don\u2019t know if she hasn\u2019t felt it, but there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t take her with you, let her go.\u201d\u201cDo you know what will happen to the princess if I let her go?\u201dVerndia described the ill-treatment and attempted confinement he had seen in Silkisia.He tried to tell the truth, that Psychke continued to faint all over again, and he also talked about not remembering the conversation they had before after she woke up.\u201cShe won\u2019t be beaten in Silkisia just because of the petty reason of being here. The Princess is a strong person. But\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy are you trying to help her?\u201dLia asked, sitting on the sofa after collecting the mana around.\u201cWhat do you have to do with her? Compassion? Sadness? That must have been not the case.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just say I want to crush that Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know.\u201dVerndia clasped his lips. Every time he looked at her, a certain emotion of his reverberated, yet it was indescribable.To put it bluntly, it\u2019s like watching a tree full of scars trapped in a storm\u2026It\u2019s similar to the feeling of being sad, but there\u2019s something different about it. He wanted to keep watching her and wanted to hug her. She is someone he wants to protect.Verndia, who was looking back at his feelings, opened his mouth. He said something that was similar to the answer that he found in himself but not the correct answer itself.\u201cI seem to have projected my childhood seeing the Princess. It was very difficult for me back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026. That.\u201d\u201cThere was no other way for me, but the princess had another way.\u201dHe wanted to finish the topic, so he ended it.As if she was convinced, Lia clenched her teeth tightly, but didn\u2019t object anymore.After quite a while, the wizard who returned to the form of a girl muttered as if chewing.\u201cLet her wield her abilities.\u201d\u201cAbilities?\u201d\u201cYeah. First, I think we need to get rid of the perception that it is a curse.\u201dLia doesn\u2019t know what the magic is to knock Psyche out every time she comes to a conclusion.But the \u2018Help me\u2019. Or, \u2018Please don\u2019t abandon me\u2019 words. It seems to be related to her childhood.Therefore, recklessly awakening her powers might not be ideal.\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible.\u201dVerndia clicked his tongue briefly.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not, she\u2019s practicing to control it.\u201d\u201cBetter than doing nothing. I\u2019ll try to find out more about what kind of magic it is. And\u2026\u2026.\u201dLia said hesitating.\u201cHelp Aiden.\u201d\u201cThat human?\u201dVerndia wiggled one eyebrow. It meant he was displeased by the blurted words.\u201cTry it, you know. I broke up ties with Gann Hillace.\u201dLia revealed Verndia\u2019s release of false information by talking about the barrier.\u201cI think he did this to see how far the rumors of forbidden magic spread. Time has passed, but it has not spread anywhere.\u201d\u201cYou told the princess. So, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201cIt\u2019s not like that-\u201d\u201cBe honest.\u201dVerndia cut bluntly.\u201cI really hate Hillace. Ilia, including you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cNevertheless, I am dealing with you because you are the most conscientious person. It\u2019s also because you can make medicine.\u201dVerndia wiggled her brows as a sign of discomfort.\u201cBut you\u2019re asking me to help Hillace again.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not asking for free help. From now on, I will give you the medicine without any conditions.\u201d\u201cThat alone can\u2019t be enough.\u201dVerndia pressed his chin.\u201cBe on the front line in the investigation of forbidden magic.\u201d\u201cI still do\u2014\u201d\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know that when I sent someone to investigate the alleyway, you got a clue and ran away? Thanks to you, half a day of precious time has passed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always like that. Running away after knowing something. Even in the case of Leas 20 years ago\u2014\u201c\u201cStop.\u201dFor her it was hard to live.Verndia, who deliberately touched her trauma, raised one corner of his lips.\u201cSo do it right. Aren\u2019t you ashamed to hear something like this from a younger person?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Okay. If I can, I will.\u201d\u201cThere is one more.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cProactively investigate the case of Leas. I know that it has been abandoned since the auction house.\u201dAs if asking why he was caring about that, Lia raised her brow.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that the Leas case and the Forbidden Magic were somehow related?\u201d\u201cThey are. But the probability that the \u2018it\u2019 you are looking for is related to the Leas case is-\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s either no or the chances are low. I know.\u201dVerndia let out his breath mixed with annoyance.His beggarly weakness of will.If she hadn\u2019t been a princess, he wouldn\u2019t have cared whether Lia was investigating the Leas case or not.\u201cIt\u2019s just to incite your shallow will. Why do you change the subject? A three-year-old child will be more reliable than you.\u201d\u201cYou! Talking like that to me!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no reason for me to help Aiden.\u201dVerndia hated Aiden. He hates him because he is an Hillace, even more because Psychke cares too much about him.However, he had to help him. Hillace approached her as far as lowering his status as an enlisted soldier.And a wizard who tried to kill Psychke by summoning even a beast with forbidden magic.He had a feeling that Aiden might have some clues related to the Leas case.Conversely, if Lia did not investigate the Leas case, Aiden is useless for him. He had no reason to help.\u201cI will if I can!\u201dLia, who eventually exploded, yelled.\u201cInstead, you help straight up too. That is our deal, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dVerndia grinned.\u201cInstead of helping in the investigation of forbidden magic, hide your identity and cooperate in the case of Leas. Didn\u2019t we make a contract like that?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dLia groaned as if trying to suppress her anger.\u201cI did.\u201dRringg!Suddenly, the clock on the table rang. It was a clock with magic so that an alarm would sound when a certain amount of time was reached. Turning off the alarm, Verndia got his body up.\u201cI need to go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 To my dear? You two gets along well?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going on a date anyway, so you can come and see her.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. But\u2026 a date?\u201dWhy is he leaving?Lia was puzzled who looked up and down at Verndia as he made his way out.***\u201cAre you doing well?\u201dIt was a quiet dance hall with only one trainee.Verndia frowned at the swaying blade.\u201cBe focused.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I was distracted, it was that I lost my strength.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been five hours though?\u201dIt\u2019s only five hours.From dawn, he hung sand pockets on his hands and feet and circled the lotus field.He did stabbing and slashing, which are the basics of the basics, hundreds of times.Even the weather nearing summer is muggy, so it\u2019s strange that he wasn\u2019t exhausted, but only five hours-\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke, who was looking at him with resentful eyes, hastily turned her head.More than ten days have passed but looking at him still vividly recalls the events of that day.\u2018I should have left. Why did I\u2026\u2026.\u2019That day, Psychke was about to leave.She was regretful that Verndia put a lot of pressure on her. He told her to leave since he won\u2019t be tracking her whereabouts anyway.But\u2026\u2018I made a promise at the auction house. Last but not least, why don\u2019t we spar for the last time?\u2019That was the issue.Just as fish cannot live out of water, a swordsman could not reject a Swords master\u2019s offer.And in the subsequent spar, Psychke was terribly defeated.It was the first time to see such a defeat.She felt bitter seeing the differences between their skill. It felt like she had been hit by a wall that she couldn\u2019t move on.But that kind of being,\u2018I think it\u2019ll be fine with a little more refinement.\u2019\u2018Do you not want to learn swordsmanship formally?\u2019\u2018I can teach you.\u2019\u2018I can give you more sparring.\u2019\u2018You should be able to touch me.\u2019She should have left and didn\u2019t ask for help, and her heart had been broken helplessly.But private lessons from a Sword Master. When will she get this chance again?\u201cIs it very difficult?\u201dWithout notice, Verndia inched his face to her.Psychke avoided his gaze.\u201cThen rest for ten minutes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dPutting down her sword, Psychke rubbed his sore arms. The wounds from the beasts had completely healed.Verndia secretly glanced at his fianc\u00e9e like that.\u2018I really didn\u2019t know I was going to do this all.\u2019In fact, he didn\u2019t show it, but he was surely terrified that Psyche would disappear from his sight.So, so that there is no stamina left to run away, the intensity of training was increased so that she would collapse completely from exhaustion.She was going to reduce it to a certain extent if he made it too hard. She didn\u2019t know that she would do everything she was told to do without saying anything.\u2018Talent is a waste.\u2019What if she had been educated by a proper teacher from an early age?Maybe she would have been much stronger than she is now, Verndia thought.\u201cShall we fight, Princess?\u201dFrom that day on, the only time he made eye contact with Psychke was when they were fighting.He regretted it, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. Because he could see her when he normally doesn\u2019t.He said, for example, that she has lovely sparkling eyes.She has a lively expression or-\u201cYes.\u201dIn response to the short answer, Verndia immediately grabbed his sword. Originally, they used practice swords for sparring.(TN: In relation to Lia and Leas case, they are different. Some of you might be confused, so I was, but they are different. The novel hasn\u2019t said anything to clear what is Leas\u2019 case, but we\u2019ll know sooner or later, I guess.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySimilarly, Psychke holding the sword in her hand, took a step further away from him.They are in the Hall for the Head of the family, therefore, they were alone here.\u201cPlease go on.\u201dVerndia conceded the first attack.Psychke immediately kicked the ground and ran towards him. Her footsteps were heavy as if she was already tired.But Verndia let that power go lightly.\u201cI think I was certain of telling you not to push ahead ignorantly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou can lose your wrist that way.\u201dUpon hearing this, Psychke changed her posture and went straight in. It was a highly restrained swordsmanship that condensed all the power at the tip of the sword.However, Verndia also blocked her by hitting the tip of her sword lightly.Her wrists trembled at the vibration transmitted from his sword. Without hesitation, Psychke grabbed the handle of her sword again.\u201cLook. It almost went out.\u201dHe closed his eyebrows nicely.The match he was having with Psychke was fun.It was good to have someone who would accept his sword like this, and it was good to have someone who was always like a melancholy cat, lively.It felt good to accept everything taught like an empty sponge sucking up water, and it was good to see the improvements in her skills day by day.Really, everything was good.\u201cNow, let\u2019s do it right.\u201dVerndia, who bounced off his sword, raised his mana. A deep purple light sharply enveloped the sword.Seeing the blue light surrounding the dagger in his vision, he knew that Psychke could craft swords.\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can face it upfront, avoid it.\u201dThe atmosphere around her changed when Verndia, who was only defensive, changed his posture.\u201cNo, it will break.\u201dHe wiped away his laughter and struck down his sword. A terrifying pounding sound was added to the neat movements without a single fuss.Psychke, who had been hesitating, showed off her sword without any hesitation.It was as sharp as Verndia\u2019s, but it was blunt and hazy for some reason. It looked like it had been covered with a gray dark cloud.Kwang-!! There was a loud roar.\u201cYou know that you can let go, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do it right?\u201dVerndia spoke as if whispering to Psychke, who received the energy and received it.\u201cYour wrist, I don\u2019t want to break it.\u201dNevertheless, her swordsmanship was not very skilled compared to him. Verndia gave more strength to her wrists.As the purple sword grew darker, their two swords leaned to one side.Ugh! Psychke groaned in pain.Verndia, who briefly clicked his tongue at her stubbornness, ignited a spark.Even proper breathing became difficult due to the heat that crushed her whole body. She opened her mouth and let out a rough breath.\u201cDo you want to die like this?\u201dNo, she doesn\u2019t like that.Psychke completed her sword skills by raising her mana to the limit.The dull blue color became darker. As all her nerves turned toward making her sword stronger, her cursed powers that she had suppressed began to rampage.Thus! Something like hail was pouring down from behind.She turned around, shocked to hear it but a voice stopped her midway.\u201cConcentration.\u201dViolet eyes as dazzling as his flame on his sword looked at her.\u201cPrincess can control whatever she wants.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 ugh\u2026 no\u2026\u201dOddly enough, when she was with Verndia, her abilities became rampant.She bit her lip until it bled and tried to withdraw her powers. However, she was unable due to a series of attacks.\u201cDon\u2019t just say no, and don\u2019t try to force it.\u201dThere were large and small scars all over her face, but she did not stop. Verndia mercilessly pushed her away.He had a reason for doing this.\u201cAaccck!\u201dSince she was pushed by his power, she rolled over the floor. Still, she didn\u2019t avoid his sword.\u201cStand up.\u201dIf he didn\u2019t hit the limit, she wouldn\u2019t use her skills.Since the foreign substances accumulated in her body are being removed with the doctor\u2019s medicine, it is possible that she can handle this slowly.This was just a mind problem, not a body problem.And Verndia didn\u2019t know how to fix a broken heart other than this.\u2018Tuut.\u2019He feels annoyed seeing her covered in scars. She has superpowers but she just needs to let it all out.He wasn\u2019t doing this just because he wanted to do so.He wanted to teach her in a gentle way and comfort her.He was never kind to anyone, so he just pushes her as usual.(TN: The thing that I don\u2019t like about Verndia is that he doesn\u2019t try to comfort her with words because he loses his temper easily and doesn\u2019t give a \u2018what\u2019 about emotions since he doesn\u2019t know that either. Emotions, he is yet to know them.)In the first place, making something soft and mellow was not like this.He knew it too, so he was confused.Why is she doing all of this? As he was standing in front of her, he felt like an idiot.\u201cIt\u2019s still a long way off.\u201dEffortlessly turning away from the incomprehensible emotions, he again pointed his sword at Psychke, who rolled over the floor.Psychke stood up, leaning against the sword without a single expression of displeasure.* * *The harsh swordsmanship class ended earlier than usual. For some reason, it was thanks to Isolet, who ran with a concerned face.Verndia followed him, and Psychke returned to her room.\u201cAccckk! Princess! What is all this!\u201dCecil screamed seeing her covered with scars.It wasn\u2019t surprising for her but for some reason, Cecil\u2019s voice gets higher as time goes by.\u201cThe Duke is too much. Where do you see a man beating the Princess like this?!\u201dIt is a word that, if misunderstood, can cause a great misunderstanding. Psychke chuckled.As she slowly became accustomed to the service from Cecil, she finished her bath and changed her clothes.As always, Cecil applied a special perfume made with herbs to help her wounds heal faster.\u201cI will get hurt again tomorrow anyway. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s why you have to apply more.\u201dIt was a very dignified yet burdensome reception.However, she decided not to refuse because it was not for Verndia\u2019s sake, and she said that Cecil was doing it voluntarily. she doesn\u2019t hate the drowsiness when she receives a massage from her,\u201cEven this\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhyuu.\u201dPsychke poked the jewelry Cecil brought. Even then, Cecil was just doing what she had to do, so Psyhcke refused.\u201cReally, there are things that have come, Princess.\u201dAfter a quick meal, Cecil left behind a moonstone the size of her fist and a letter.Psychke, who looked at her from afar, leaned back on the sofa.\u2018It\u2019s really over.\u2019After her stay in Lestir, she decided to finalize her contract with Verndia.She asked Cecil to send a sample of the report to check the moonstone\u2019s strength and effectiveness.She organized the ice magic formulas and sent them to the Northern Territory.She commissioned the information guild for the location of the mercenary that Lia had informed her that she could deal with the Asum beasts.And that information was in the letter that had just arrived.Finally, the reply was seen.\u2018I\u2019ll just ask the mercenaries and leave.\u2019Whatever happened after that, she was going to leave.Because Verndia said it\u2019s okay to leave. Because he said he wouldn\u2019t track her.Now it\u2019s really over.But why-\u2018Why do I feel this way?\u2019She thought that it would be cool when everything was sorted out. Surprisingly, she doesn\u2019t feel that way. Rather\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was difficult to describe her feelings. Psychke stared blankly at the ceiling.That was then.\u201cCan I come in?\u201dVerndia knocked on the door.(TN: Why door when you can go to a different place? Hehe.)How many times has he been before?Even before he finished speaking, he once teased her about when she asked him to come into her room with only a knock.\u2018I\u2019m out of breath. Why are you so quick-tempered?\u2019\u2018My brother was the only one knocking on my door. That\u2019s why it\u2019s become a habit not to ask.\u2019\u2018\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u2019From then on, Verndia always spoke and knocked.Psychke paused for a moment, then quietly got up and opened the door.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u2026.\u201d (TN: \u2018I missed you.\u2019 I guess you\u2019re very shy, Verndia. I adjusted, I should.)\u201cAren\u2019t you busy?\u201dHe quietly nodded his head.\u201cI have something to show to the Princess.\u201dA strangely excited voice rang in her room.Then Psychke glanced at him. Like the aide before, he had the look of a person expecting something.Somehow, she had an ominous feeling.Psychke decided to decline.\u201cSorry. I suddenly remembered that I have an urgent thing to do.\u201d\u201cIt will take only a while.\u201dDespite all the excuses, Verndia did not back down. In the end, Psychke asked directly.\u201cMay I ask what you are going to show?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dVerndia covered his lips and thought seriously for a long time, then he opened his mouth tremblingly.\u201cMy hobbies?\u201d***\u201cHow are they, aren\u2019t they pretty?\u201dUntil now, Isolet had no complaints about Verndia\u2019s tone of voice.Although he was arguing with her, he was the noblest in the empire after the emperor, so he shouldn\u2019t feel that way.But now he was about to be a little bit dissatisfied.\u201cYes, there are a lot of pretty things here.\u201d\u201cIf you want or need anything, I can give it to you.\u201dAll kinds of jewels and trinkets, eternally enchanted flowers, cute stuffed animals and more.They were in front of a warehouse where things that are popular among young ladies these days were piled up like mountains.Originally, he was planning to build a room on a large scale instead of stacking them like this.Then, Cecil said that the princess would be too burdened, so he decided to give the entire warehouse away. It meant that if she needed something, she would take it herself without feeling burdened.But why,\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you really fine with that?\u201dAre you saying you\u2019re having a conversation like that?Isolet looked at his master badly without realizing it.By reducing the time to eat, the time to wear, and the time to sleep, he collected all the things that were popular in the capital among all the young ladies.His effort seemed to fly away seeing how his master was so na\u00efve in this thing.It was all because of that guy\u2019s snout.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t really need anything.\u201dPsychke said so, as usual, expressionless, but Isolet seemed to know what the Princess was thinking.\u2018Duke, you have a very unique hobby.\u2019What are you thinking like this?Even after he said something wrong, Verndia, who became \u2018A person who piles up things that young ladies love whenever he is bored\u2019, was smiling nonetheless.But he, Isolet knew, who had been with him for the longest five years, what was the meaning of that smile. That\u2019s the smile you make when you\u2019re embarrassed.\u2018Ugh.\u2019Looking at the atmosphere roughly, he was trying to give her everything as if he couldn\u2019t win if he were to tell her to take things she needs.He guess he didn\u2019t know that she would decline them all out because she didn\u2019t need them all.\u2018Why don\u2019t you just give it to me-\u2018Depressed, the assistant sighed inwardly. No matter how you look at it, the master\u2019s love affair would not go smoothly unless he fixed his snout.***\u2018Duke, you have a very unique hobby.\u2019Unexpectedly, that\u2019s how you show things proudly.===Translator\u2019s Notes: I am really sorry for the long absence. Before full face-to-face here in my locality, which means from early morning till late noon, I am in school, it\u2019s still hard for me to find time to translate. I had always wanted to translate but worse is that there are always activities, or if not, assignment, piled of them. Almost every day, there are tests. Haa, I know I was long gone but I am truly finding time for this. To be precise, I was actually thinking to stop tling but I know that I can\u2019t. After that absence, and earlier, before translating, I was actually excited to Translate again, Haha. So, a relief that I didn\u2019t stop. Of course, the next release is still unknown but I promise, I will really do my best.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Psychke also stopped following him.\u201cI picked this up.\u201dWhat he held out was a red velvet box the size of the palm of his hand. Tied with a yellow ribbon.Psychke, who looked carefully at the box, opened her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s not mine.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dVerndia, crumpled over her impression, pushed the box and squeezed it.There was only one reason why- giving the lost items to the owner.Psychke opened her mouth without thinking.\u201cCan I take it to the butler?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith a subsequent frown, Psychke began to reflect on what she had said wrongly.Does he mean to say that we should find the owner personally and not give this task to the butler?Or should I have said I\u2019d throw it away because it was lying on the floor?\u2018By the way, this is what maids usually do\u2026\u2019He was more bothered to find a maid than she was.Since her status is higher than that of a maid, this work is something she unusually does and maids are originally there to do this.Psychke said softly.\u201cI will find the owner. But I hope you will refrain from doing this in the future.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of this situation but what he wanted to say wasn\u2019t conveyed properly.In almost tears, Verndia unwrapped the ribbon of the box. He took her hand and made her open the box.Psychke, who accidentally opened the lost and found, was perplexed.\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cEverything in Lestir is under my control, so of course what I picked up is mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Oh, I see.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what to do. Psychke bit her mouth. It was the same with Verndia, who had a hard expression on his face.Then, tired of waiting for her, she asked internally, \u2018What should I do then?\u2019 She acted more bluntly than usual.\u201cDagger, don\u2019t you need it? The old one must have been damaged by the blood of a beast.\u201dAccording to Verndia\u2019s words, the dagger she had been using lost its function as a weapon.She should have gone to the weapon shop earlier, but time was lacking so she couldn\u2019t and since she has swordsmanship class every day.\u201cI increased the mining amount because of the moonstone, but there is still a lot left. I made one.\u201dAt last Psychke looked down at what was in the box.As he says, she thinks it should be a dagger. It had only one cross-shaped earring.A blue gem presumed to be a magic crystal is embedded in the center.\u201cTake it as if you were holding a sword.\u201dShe was skeptical, but she did what she was told. At that moment, mana drained through the palm of her hand, and the earring turned into a sharp sword.\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke took a breath. It was a magic sword. She has only heard of it, but it\u2019s the first time she had seen the form itself transform in this way.She stared through the blue jewel embedded in the center of the handle.\u2018To be able to do this, it\u2019s quite superlative\u2014\u2019\u201cNow, only you can use that, Princess.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause it was made to react only to the mana of the first owner.\u201dSurprised at what he said, she put the sword down in a hurry. But because she couldn\u2019t put it into the box, she decided to place it on the floor. Yet again, it was not polite to do that, especially since the sword is an expensive item.\u201cShouldn\u2019t the princess have a personal sword, too.\u201d\u201cNo, this is\u2014\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m frustrated.\u201dVerndia glanced at the sword around my waist.He hated using the practice sword. Because it gets broken easily by hot mana and when the mana can\u2019t be retained at the right temperature. However, since Psychke was using a practice knife, he didn\u2019t have any choice but to match it.\u201cBecause the Princess can never keep up with me if this goes on.\u201d\u201cBut this is\u2026\u201dIf she was a different person, he would have been more patient. But he\u2019s frustrated now so in return, he gave her a magic sword.Psychke opened her mouth slightly at the unexpected use of frivolity, and then she stammered hard.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive-\u201c\u201cOkay. Didn\u2019t I tell you? It was made from the surplus magic crystals.\u201dJust because the amount of mining has been increased, the highest quality magic crystals remain. Even the royal family wouldn\u2019t be able to say that\u2026\u2018If I was this wealthy, I might be able to provide a magic sword to everyone in the Lestir Territory.\u2019\u201cIt doesn\u2019t come around that much.\u201dAfter reading her thoughts, Verndia declared.\u201cIt is okay to think of it as a gift to commemorate being my first disciple. It is also customary to give a sword to a swordsman as a gift.\u201d\u201cAm I your first disciple?\u201d\u201cThe first disciple, and the last disciple.\u201dThe sword in her hand turned into an earring. Verndia took the earring and put it into his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ear.The body temperature that started from her fingertips gently colored her ears.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201dHe smiled, tidying up the silver hair around her.For a moment, Psychke felt the warmth remaining in her ears spread all over her face.\u201cYe-yes. It is pretty.\u201dEarrings are pretty, so why would he look at her like that and say that?Even for her, her earrings were very pretty and luxurious. It almost didn\u2019t seem like a great craftsman had invested a lot of time because it hangs on her ears as light as feathers.\u2018My pretty sword\u2026\u2019Was it because of the joy of having the first sword, or because of Verndia\u2019s words?Her heart was pounding. Avoiding his unbreakable purple gaze, Psychke eagerly fiddled with her earring.Verndia, who had not let go of her hair until then, finally let go of it.\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere looking at someone like that.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause it looks really annoying.\u201dPsychke froze. Verndia was taken aback by the expression she had that had been erased in an instant.It somehow felt sad that she had lost that expression. He felt regretful that he wanted to swallow back when he had just spewed.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the Princess is annoying.\u201dSo, what\u2019s annoying? Looking at it in that sense, he opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it quietly. Then she twisted her gaze at an angle.It must have been a mistake, but it was also the same as seeing the reddish ears through his black hair.* * *She doesn\u2019t know what the world would be like. Still, she had never dreamed that something like this would ever happen.\u201cPlease marry me.\u201dThe sound of footsteps filling the dark alley stopped.Psychke, who had confirmed her target, was about to leave the place, but was forcibly turned her reluctant head due to what she had heart. She must have heard it wrong.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dAn unusual, neutral voice flowed from between her lips.The woman in front of her, Hilvia, clenched her fists as if she would never let the man go, and shouted at him sternly.\u201cI want you to marry me! I\u2019ll make sure you never regret it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was in the middle of an absurd situation with her mouth slightly open without realizing it.\u201cYou said you were going to get some air, but I didn\u2019t know you were cheating on me.\u201dA voice came from behind her as if he was forcibly holding back his laughter.Even without looking back, Psychke knew who it was.\u201cWhat do you mean going to get some air? No way, is he your lover? I am better than her!\u201dSo, you should marry me!Because of Hilvia fiercely clinging to him, Psychke lost her words. The growling sound of laughter, which grew proportionally, burst openly, perhaps unbearable in the end.How did it become like this?The incident began three hours ago.It all started from the unplanned going out with Verndia, Cecil, and Isolet.***\u201cTake a look at this too. I think it will suit you.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty too. Do you like this? This will look good on you.\u201d\u201cHey, Princess! Let\u2019s go over there!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t get the chatter off of her mind which poured like a storm; the endless procession of ornaments.Psychke at first declined that these ornaments won\u2019t be worn but it was only at the beginning.The trinkets she wore suddenly became one, two, and three.When she finally left the jewelry store, Psychke was holding a circlet she thought she would never live on in her hand.\u201cIt goes so well with the earrings that the Princess wore. I am sorry if I offended you.\u201dIt was an unexpected expense, but she didn\u2019t feel bad.Because of what Cecil said last night.\u2018Did the Duke give you earrings? Oh, my, my.\u2019\u2018But why only one pair?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t have a dress that suits me. It doesn\u2019t even match the jewelry I have now.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll choose a lot of pretty things for you, Princess. Let\u2019s go out together tomorrow!\u2019\u2018I was most envious of the kids who went shopping with the person they served.\u2019\u2018How sad it was that the Duke did not have a sister.\u2019With those words, Psychke thought of Melissa.Whenever she said Lillian was getting a new dress or jewelry, Melissa put everything aside and followed Lillian.She had crossed over and overheard. For an employee serving a female aristocrat, going to a boutique with the owner is one of the pleasures of a hard life.The person who took care of her warmly begs me like that despite not needing it, she couldn\u2019t adamantly refuse.She had to go out tomorrow, so she had to postpone her swordsmanship class.It was said that even the wishes of the dead can come true.Psychke decided to go out with Cecil.And she did,\u201cThe necklace earlier looks good. Did you buy it too?\u201d\u201cI want the Duke to buy you\u2014\u201d\u201cIsolet.\u201dI didn\u2019t expect these two men to follow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPsychke glanced at the aide walking around holding a mountain of papers and the man next to him, who was diligently processing the report Isolet gave him.During the stay in the store, the two were doing just that. She didn\u2019t know why they followed her when they were this busy.Verndia, who felt her gaze, grumbled lightly.\u201cHa, I am not the one procrastinating here. It\u2019s because he gave me these all at once.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I played in my leisure time. Didn\u2019t the Duke command me to do that? To find out what noble girls like the most\u2014\u201dIsolet, who had been protesting that it was unfair, was taken aback for a moment and shut his mouth when his realization hit his mind.Because Verndia was turning his back, Psychke couldn\u2019t see the expression on his face.So, how long has it been since he wandered around with his strange companion like Isolet?\u201cI will go to the wagon.\u201dShe didn\u2019t buy many things, but it felt like they had gone two laps around the city. They were sitting in front of the fountain in the central square to rest.Isolet, who was about to hand his report to Verndia, stopped. Then he rummaged through the things he had brought and excused himself saying that he left a one page of his report.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t notice that. Have a good time, Princess and Your Excellency!\u201dNot long after he left, Cecil also smiled meaningfully and disappeared somewhere who-knows-where.Again, in an instant, the two were left alone. Psychke looked down at her feet, as the sound of pouring water filled her ears.She was uncomfortable and awkward.It was not only because people glanced at them from time to time, but also because of Verndia\u2019s purple eyes which were looking at her.\u2018Does he have anything to say?\u2019Then, she\u2019d prefer it if he says what he wants. He shouldn\u2019t look at him like that.Psychke tapped the ground with her foot, waiting for either Cecil or Isolet to come.She couldn\u2019t even imagine that Cecil would have dragged Isolet who came along with them.She was killing time thinking that way, yet again, something crept into her mind and broke the silence between them.\u201cHave you met Sir Aiden?\u201dVerndia wrinkled his face as if he had heard something he shouldn\u2019t have heard.\u201cYou already knew. You don\u2019t have to worry about him, Princess.\u201dIt was because she couldn\u2019t apologize to him for being kicked out from Silkisia.When she found out that he was the target of the beasts, she was very concerned.Which means the person behind it wants to warn her.There is no means of contact.So, she wandered the alleyways of Silkisia, wondering if she might ever meet him.Then she was caught by Verndia.Verndia said there was a way to contact Aiden, and advised her not to worry about it as he would take care of it.But she couldn\u2019t do so because she knew that Verndia hated Aiden.(TN: Man is jealous of Aiden~ Ahaha)\u201cOkay.\u201dLia must have told her about it. He was glad that she already knew about it.\u201cYou really have nothing to do with him, are you?\u201dIt was such an awkward question.Psychke raised her head. A man who looked stiff, looked at her with his arms crossed.\u201cYes. You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cBut why do you care so much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous situation, so you have to tell me.\u201d\u201cEven if her princess doesn\u2019t care about him, there are people who would do so.\u201dShe knew. Because that day, Lia ran away in a hurry.But just because he had someone to take care of him couldn\u2019t keep her from resting. Someone\u2019s life is at stake.\u201cJust forget it. Hillace is not a family to come close to.\u201dPsychke stared at him, who gave an exasperated tone. Then she let out a slightly bitter voice.\u201cDuke. I am also Silkisia.\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t get any closer-\u201c\u201cI want to tell you that I also come from a family that supports the emperor.\u201dVerndia bit his mouth.\u201cI know that those who support the Crown Prince hate Hillace, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason why I should stay away from the Power Race.\u201dThere may be differences depending on the faction, but she didn\u2019t like trying to enforce her way of thinking on others unconditionally.In her view, Baron Hillace was right to be away, but his son Aiden Hillace seemed to be a decent person to be close to.Even if one tries to mix them up, no one can change that part.He didn\u2019t have a good reputation for judging people based on someone\u2019s opinion alone.Psychke didn\u2019t want to do that anymore.He didn\u2019t want to treat anyone with judgement.\u201cOr is there any other reason I should stay away from Hillace?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Even if I told you, you wouldn\u2019t even remember.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo. So, you\u2019re saying you two are going to be closer in the future?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have any reason to walk away from him.\u201d\u201cDid you really have an affair?\u201d\u201cI have already said no. And- \u201cPsychke nailed it to and fro.\u201cI think you said it back then. You claimed that it doesn\u2019t matter if I am in a relationship. Therefore, I don\u2019t know why you keep asking.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201dVerndia\u2019s eyes widened.For a moment, in Psychke\u2019s eyes, he looked like a madman.\u201cI\u2026.\u201dAfter a long time, he opened his mouth.However, he could not spit out the completed sentence in his mind, but only sparsely cut words.\u201cSo\u2026\u201dHis purple eyes fluttered wildly.\u201cBecause we\u2019re engaged\u2026 So\u2026\u201dHe rolled his eyes dizzy like a speechless man, avoiding her gaze and half-covering his face with one hand.Right at that moment. There was a certain emotion that was transmitted to the ring Psychke was wearing.\u2018This?\u2019Is this just emotional sharing?Psychke focused on that feeling.It was stuffy, and it felt like he was crushing his chest with a lump of stone. Anxiety about not knowing what the future holds.This was impatience.\u2018So he was saying that I should go now. It\u2019s been a while, so it must have been a malfunction.\u2019She looked down at the ring, which had a soft golden hue.She can\u2019t believe that Verndia was nervous. It was absurd if he falls in love; just like a rock falling in love.He is a man who did not budge even when the news of the imperial knights\u2019 expedition was delayed. There\u2019s no way such a person could suddenly become impatient over this matter.Whether it was right or wrong, the shared feelings faded away in the blink of an eye.With the sound of deep breathing, Verndia lowered her hand that was covering her face.He had a very angry expression.\u201cYes.\u201dA voice that sounded like chewing came from between the clenched teeth.\u201cWhether the princess has a lover or not, I don\u2019t care. Do whatever you want.\u201dHe ended the conversation in a tone like he would kill her if she had a lover and turned her back from him.\u2018Why was it there?\u2019She suddenly wondered why he felt angry. He was just merely repeating what he said before though.Psychke turned her eyes away from his wide back wrapped in a black cape, and soon realized why.Everyone in the vicinity was spying on her and Verndia with curious eyes.At that distance, they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the conversation they were having, but she thought he might not like it enough.They\u2019re engaged, but in a public place, they\u2019re lovers. It was understandable that he was angry.\u2018You gave me a sword, but while we\u2019re together, I\u2019ll have to spar with you.\u2019Psychke looked at Verndia again. And softly she opened her mouth.\u201cI apologize if I offended you. I didn\u2019t mean that way-\u201cA black shadow was cast in front of the sudden sunlight.Psychke looked up reflexively. It was hard to see the other person\u2019s face because he was against the light.\u201cHello, Duke.\u201dIt was a voice she had heard somewhere.As Psychke continued to look at the person, remembering him. Verndia also turned his head slightly. She didn\u2019t raise his face like Psychke did, he just made a gesture that he was listening.\u201cI-\u201c\u201cAm I supposed to look up?\u201d\u201cI, I am sorry!\u201dEven so, the small body was completely extinguished. At last Psychke could see her face.He was one of the men who followed Hilvia in social circles and wooed passionately. His face was triangular in appearance, resembling a mouse. (TN: Pftt, that was harsh. I didn\u2019t mean to laugh\u2014)\u201cI am Myce Gueronica. I don\u2019t know if you still remember me, but at the last meeting of the Lords\u2014\u201d\u201cStop the nonsenseGueronica.She has never seen such a family on either the Crown Prince\u2019s side or the Emperor\u2019s side, but maybe he was one of them.Or a family that adheres to strict neutrality.Or their power is so weak that it can\u2019t fit anywhere.Seeing that Verndia could not even make eye contact, Myce seemed to be the latter.\u201cI have something to tell you\u2026\u201dMyce, who received the angry gaze from him, trembled softly. He was guilty of speaking when he was not in a good mood.\u201cJu-just a bit of your time, could you give me some time\u2026\u2026\u201dAny nobleman would have given up on talking and ran away. Psychke thought that Verndia was already very courageous.Originally, the nobles were reluctant to visit Verndia.The tragic downfall of those who opposed him and the North.A mad temper that, if mistreated, sparked fire even in front of His Majesty the Emperor.In addition to that, the way he talks and his personality is hard to get close to.Since his intention is not to make friends, it\u2019s better not to touch him. Psychke agreed. Had it not been for their forced engagement, she wouldn\u2019t even have spoken to Verndia.\u201cHmm.\u201dVerndia raised his head to say something.It was annoying him but he was also familiar with the rumors around this Myce.If he kicks Myce out, Psychke was looking curiously.Then Myce glanced at Psychke and pleaded with difficulty in a trembling voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt\u2019s something that only the Duke should hear\u2026\u201d\u201cGo away.\u201dIt was obvious that the fool man in front of him carries no important information but miscellaneous.Rather, it was more urgent to talk to the princess.He apologized, even though he didn\u2019t mean it that way.Because of this beggar, he didn\u2019t hear the most important next part.In fact, it was already a generosity for Verndia to listen this far. If Psychke had not reacted, this man wouldn\u2019t get far by greeting him.\u201cYou must, you must listen.\u201dThe man, who was shaking as if he had been hit by a stick, barely squealed.It was then that Verndia, furious to end this conversation but when he was about to speak up, another voice said,\u201cI think you\u2019re in a hurry, so I\u2019ll get out. You two have a good talk.\u201dAnd Psychke got up from her seat.The bewildered Verndia looked up at her. With his puppy-like-eyes looking at his owner who was about to leave.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get some fresh air and come back. I also need to go somewhere.\u201dHe knew that she had chores that she needed to do before they left his residence. He couldn\u2019t let go of his regrets, which only increased.He didn\u2019t think about how he would look like to others.\u201cThere are still things we need to talk about.\u201d\u201cI will come back to do so. For now, this man seems to be more hurried than me.\u201dBefore he could say anything, Psychke moved her feet and disappeared from the crowd.He was immediately abandoned. Verndia followed the trail with his vain eyes, clenching his teeth and slowly turning his head to the man in front of him, until his gums grew sour.\u201cIf it\u2019s content isn\u2019t worth saliva, you better be prepared.\u201d* * *Dark eyes followed her wherever she went. Ignoring all of that, Psyckhe stood up and walked upright.It wasn\u2019t usually like this. Why is it unusually hot today?Looking at everyone\u2019s eyes on her, it seemed they knew she ran away from home.\u2018I see.\u2019Alleyways, fountains, quarrels.Combining the words that came in, it seemed to make sense.It seemed to be trying to connect the incident that happened in the alleyway near the Silkisia mansion with the fight in front of the fountain a while ago.\u2018Cecil said that there were bad rumors related to the Duke.\u2019It actually didn\u2019t matter to her whether the rumors of her quarreling with her brothers came out, but the gazes that followed her felt so unpleasant as if they were looking at an animal in a cage.She felt better when she was with Verndia, but perhaps since she was alone now, everyone sees her as easy prey.She even had people muttering to each other while staring at her.\u2018Hooh.\u2019She was accustomed to accepting those harsh gazes. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that being used to it doesn\u2019t feel bad. She felt as if her every move was being watched and insulted.She bought a pair of toe-to-toe robes from a nearby store. And wore it behind a deserted building.She wore the hood of it, thinking she would not draw attention with her appearance.She then turned the turquoise jewel of the bracelet she was wearing three times.It\u2019s something she\u2019s been wearing since infiltrating the auction house. Even Lia asked why is she wearing something that doesn\u2019t even have mana?Although she once entered the auction house illegally, there was nothing to worry, because she wouldn\u2019t need to pretend to know anyone nor is there anyone to know. Aside from that, Verndia assured her that he had already handled everything.\u201cHey, did you see that person over there?\u201dOnce she changed her appearance, those venomous gazes disappeared. The women passing by from time to time only glanced at her with curious eyes.\u201cWho is it? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him \u2026 he\u2019s handsome.\u201dPsychke pretended not to hear and made her steps faster.She left the towns where the aristocrats mostly occupied and headed for the streets of the commoners.People walking on the streets were generally excited.\u201cDid you hear that the prince is in the parade!\u201d\u201cReally? Ah, I wish he would look at me just once.\u201d\u201cYou should hope for something you will get. It would be easier to get the stars in the sky.\u201dIf her memory is correct, there is still time until the banquet to commemorate the prince\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony. The festival that everyone, aristocrats, and commoners can enjoy, starts tomorrow.And during the festival, splendid events were held in each district of the capital.\u2018I thought there was a wall hanging around here.\u2019Psychke looked around. She was searching for a poster with the schedule of the event written on it.\u2018Ah, here it is.\u2019She started looking for an event called \u2018The Doll Kingdom\u2019 by scanning the poster.It was there that she had to meet someone.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, dear. I will originally introduce the Asum treatment to my friend, but he suddenly went away and I can\u2019t contact him. Instead, I will tell you about a mercenary with a history of dealing with Asum.\u2019Dellas.It was the name Lia gave her.But she said that in the mercenary guild, such mercenaries were not registered.She entrusted the intelligence guild to investigate, so that she could find out the whereabouts of the mercenaries.And the result was as follows.\u300c\u201cI\u2019m sure of my skills, but I tend to receive requests as I like.\u201dYou don\u2019t belong to the guild, so you have to find it yourself.Rumor has it that it will appear on the first day of the \u2018Doll Kingdom\u2019 during this festival.\u201d\u300dThe Doll kingdom.It was an event aimed at young children, and it was a small kingdom created by injecting magic into all kinds of cute dolls.Most mercenaries have a strong image.They are not as good as Verndia who collects feminine things, but she thought this person wouldn\u2019t be normal either.\u2018The doll kingdom, the doll kingdom\u2026\u2026\u2019Found you.Engraving the date and place in her mind, the poster fell. She was about to go to where she intended to when\u2014\u201c\u2014!\u201dShe bumped her shoulder hard with someone who was walking blindly.\u201cKyaak!\u201dThe letter that was in someone\u2019s arms came out and fell to the floor flatteringly.The woman, who fell on her hips, opened her eyes with anger and tidied her robe because it showed her inner clothes.\u201cNo, where the hell you were looking at \u2013 you?\u201dIt was Hilvia.Hilvia immediately recognized Psychke, whose appearance was changed. Maybe it was because she stared at her as if he was going to kill her at the auction house, but she avoided looking at her while trying to make a joke.\u201c\u2026 Heh, I have to be patient with the kind I am.\u201dMumbling such nonsense, Hilvia grabbed the letter, which was nearly trampled on by the passersby.However, the family crest on the envelope of the letter caught her eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhy is that on her?Psychke looked at Hilvia\u2019s arms, which were holding the letter.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dShe heard from Lilian that the man with silver hair and turquoise eyes was not related to Silkisia.The fact that she entered the illegal auction house meant that she was a wealthy nobleman.So Hilvia used her respectful words while displeased.\u201cThat letter-\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense, really.\u201dNot hearing Psychke\u2019s words, Hilvia moved her steps again.She looked around but couldn\u2019t freely move], as if she was being pursued by an unknown figure.If she had read the sentence on the envelope of the letter correctly, she could have guessed where she was going.Psychke followed Hilvia. And it wasn\u2019t long before she knew what she was afraid of.\u201cLet go of me! Where are you touching with your dirty hands?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t contact you, what can I do?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t even want to do it like this.\u201dHilvia resisted the two men approaching her, squirming her hands away.Even her cry for help was drowned out by the hustle and bustle of the surroundings.Hilvia knew that someone was looking at her but at a glance, she saw that she was now surrounded by the dangerous men and people went away pretending not to see her.\u201cI, do you know who I am? If my father knows-\u201c\u201cI know you very well, Miss Hilvia Esland. Since the Marquis won\u2019t come out, shouldn\u2019t he get her daughter as well?\u201dThe two men who exchanged meaningful glances held her arms to prevent her from running away. Then she was dragged down a sparsely populated alleyway.Psychke chased them without trying to hide her presence.\u201cI, what do you want from\u2026 me\u2026\u201dEntering the quiet alleyway, Hilvia let out her frightened voice.For some reason today, there were no escorts for this girl who was outside here.Did she even sneak out?\u201cIf my father finds out, you will all die\u2026\u2026.. it would be better if you let me go soon\u2026.?\u201d\u201cI wish I could see your face like that.\u201dAt the glance of one man, another man pulled out something.Just then, Hilvia, who found that Psychke was watching them, screamed at her.\u201cHelp!\u201dThe eyes of the two men turned to Psychke.\u201cSave people! Help-!\u201dFor a brief moment, Psychke looked dangerous.A small dagger popped out of the sleeve of one of the men who was holding nothing, with an engraved long knife on one of his cheeks.She raised her hands to indicate that she had no will to fight. She said in a low voice.\u201cYou, too, stop joking around.\u201d\u201cHa? Are you kidding me?\u201dAs if it was fun, the man with the dagger shone sharply in his eyes. Then, as if denying her words, he put the dagger to Hilvia\u2019s neck.It didn\u2019t even touch her skin, but Hilvia was startled, as if she was already on the verge of dying; just one step behind.\u201cKyaaak! Mom!\u201d\u201cDoes this still look like a joke?\u201d\u201cBlack Moon.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201dA twinkle flashed in the man\u2019s eyes.He narrowed his eyes and looked intently at Psychke, then quickly hid his dagger, and nodded.Then someone who was watching the situation came up and offered something to Hilvia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was a memorandum of an overdue interest.\u201cWh, what is this\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter checking the memorandum, Hilvia\u2019s face turned blue. It was the first time she saw the amount of debt her family owed.With the man behind her, the man with a knife cut on his cheek approached Psychke and lit his cigarette.\u201cHow did you know?\u201dHe blew cigarette smoke in front of her face. He seemed to be from the West with a strange accent.\u2018It is rare for a Westerner to assimilate into an empire in this way\u2026\u2019Psychke frowned and avoided the smoke.\u201cThe rumor that Esland is using illegal bonds doesn\u2019t last for a day or two. I didn\u2019t know it would be the \u2018Black Moon\u2019.\u201dWhen the two men approached Hilvia, Psychke was a bit bewildered.It\u2019s because she didn\u2019t notice the popularity of these men who suddenly appeared like ordinary bastards.Because there were so many passersby around, they literally seemed to have fallen from the sky.And when they took Hilvia with her, she saw their gait.An unusual gait that was gentle and did not lean back so as not to make a sound.She realized right there. They are highly trained assassins.Assassins who have to eliminate the target keeps the target alive.Esland owes a huge debt to illegal loan sharks.Among the illegal loan sharks associated with the assassin\u2014\u2018Black Moon.\u2019She learned about them through Lenox\u2019s previous accident.(TN: How many sins have you committed, Lenox? Haay\u2026)The \u2018Black Moon\u2019, known as a group of Mercenary, is actually an assassination guild and also serves as a private loaner as their side job.So the men who took Hilvia would be assassins from the Black Moon and debt collectors.Because of this, Psychke deliberately made a move and followed them.There\u2019s no reason to be wary, and there\u2019s nothing more foolish than dealing with assassins in this tight space.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThere was no reason to explain what she knew. Psychke passed the question with an emotionless expression.\u201cHa\u2026 This is really.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t expect an answer in the first place, so he just smiled and didn\u2019t ask any more.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dThe man who demanded Hilvia to sign the papers didn\u2019t draw more attention.But the man with the knife cut mark on his face only looked at Psychke, and simply turned his back after he had burned a cigarette.In the alley where the two men left, only strong cigarette smoke remained.Through the smoke, Psychke approached the almost deaf Hilvia.(TN: Dasurv Hilvia!)\u201cThat letter-\u201c\u201cAre you still a man?\u201dThe words were cut off by a sudden slur.Maybe it was because she thought a nobleman wouldn\u2019t touch her.Hilvia was full of poison.\u201cWhen was that time you stared at me as if you were going to kill me but didn\u2019t fight earlier? You should have killed them all!\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know what kind of danger she caused to anger others with this new appearance.To be honest, the Assassins of the Black Moon would have scared her more if she hadn\u2019t been in this appearance for herself. Meaning to repay the money quickly.Psychke listened quietly to the muzzle, and then she took a step forward.Was it because of the narrow streets and the cold eyes?\u201cWh, what else?\u201dHilvia trembled her shoulders as she smirked.\u201cDo you think I\u2019d be scared to you just because I saw them?\u201d\u201cWhy does Young Lady have Silkisia\u2019s letter?\u201dAs if she had been caught wrong, the stingy Hilvia bit her mouth.But after a moment\u2019s hesitation, she patted her chest proudly as if she ever did.\u201cWhat nonsense do you think I\u2019m a letter carrier or something-\u201d\u201cLilian Silkisia?\u201dHilvia bit her mouth again.To add certainty to the address, Psychke asked one last time.\u201cThe place she wanted to go was at 271-2 Corte, a craftsman\u2019s stonework shop that is said to be the best in the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no answer, but the expression on her face was enough.A feeling of excruciating fatigue engulfed her whole body. Psychke squeezed her eyes shut.\u2018Lilian\u2026. is going to make a poison needle necklace.\u2019Was it like this in the past?Was the necklace that led me to death an imitation of Keitan\u2019s necklace?\u201cDid you read the letter?\u201d\u201cWhy are you writing someone else\u2019s letter\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid she say she\u2019d give you money if you brought it to her?\u201d\u201cWhat do you see me as?!Hilvia, who was furious and unraveling unsolicited information, stopped.Psychke smirked.\u2018Doesn\u2019t the excuse of being sick never get tired?\u2019Nothing has changed from the past.Under these circumstances, Hilvia was seen as a scapegoat.She did it because if she approached the craft shop through her or Melissa, she could be trampled on by her tail.\u2018Hilvia\u2026. is simple, but she didn\u2019t think she was stupid.\u2019She think she was overrated. If she was a nobleman, she would have doubted why she asked me to deliver the letter to her instead of her maid, and she would have refused.\u2018Or, was Lilian that good?\u2019\u201cHey, do you think I am a beggar just because I am being chased by loan sharks- I am Hilvia Eslan. Eslan pays for money\u2026.?\u201dHer shrill voice faded away in an instant. It was because of Psychke\u2019s stinging gaze that it was too burdensome to fill her place..\u201cThat, that-\u201d\u201c\u2026 .?\u201d\u201cIs that right? That!\u201dWhat is that?Hilvia was fumbling, pointing to the cross earring on Psychke\u2019s ear, or to be more precise, the magic stone in the earring.\u201cWow, really, woah, woah-\u201dFeeling frustrated, Psychke frowned.Then she was startled by the sentence bursting out with a groan and put her hand on her earring.\u201cTears of the waves! I heard that it was sold for 50 million gold in the recent auction!\u201dFive, fifty million\u2026?\u2018If that money\u2026\u2019Psychke counted the astronomical amount in her head, and it hardened.While she did, Hilvia happily recounted the story of \u2018Tears of the Waves\u2019.\u201cIf you look closely, it is true that the inside wobbles as if the waves were hardened. I heard that an unidentified nobleman bought it, and that was you\u2026\u201dHilvia glanced at Psychke with her unfamiliar eyes. Then she suddenly changed her complexion and grabbed the hand that was not holding her earring.Thanks to that, Psychke, who woke up from the chaos, shook off the hand in vain.\u201cTake care\u2026\u201dShe turned back, leaving a farewell that she did not know what she had said.She must confirm what she had just found out. But for now, she must get out of this place and quickly go to Verndia.But the words that followed caught her by the ankle.\u201cPlease marry me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d\u201cI want you to marry me! I\u2019ll make sure you never regret it!\u201dWith her fists clenched, Psychke lost her words to Hilvia, who cried out loudly.\u201cYou said you were going to get some air, but I didn\u2019t know you were cheating on me.\u201dAnd that feeling was multiplied by the man\u2019s voice coming from behind, along with the vibration of the ring hidden in his glove.* * *\u2018Help me.\u2019He pushed Hilvia, who was hardly ever going to fall, and asked with the shape of her mouth.But Verndia only smiled at her, but he didn\u2019t move.Psychke gauged the amount of mana left on her appearance change bracelet.It seemed that the magic would soon be dispelled.\u2018I can\u2019t be exposed. Help me.\u2019If the moment of her being exposed to Hilvia- it would be a terror.Hilvia will say that the fake princess made fun of her and tell Lillian what happened.Then Lilian will find out she\u2019s caught and it would be troublesome to hide again.\u201cYou\u2019re dating me. Yes? Yes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want it. Let go of me now.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want too, either!\u201dIt was the first time she knew that an ordinary person, not even a prosecutor, could be so attached to her.\u2018If I push this woman with force, she\u2019d greatly get hurt.\u2019The decision of leaving was the last resort she had.Psychke grabbed the hem of her robe as Hilvia pulled her tight. And then she looked at Verndia eagerly.\u201cOh, that\u2019s really funny.\u201dWiping Hilvia\u2019s tears, she said casually.\u201cYoung Lady, if you don\u2019t let go of that hand, you will greatly regret it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI know Duke\u2019s\u2026 fianc\u00e9 well.\u201dInstead of habitually calling her a princess, Verndia smiled.It was a sly laugh.\u201cShe\u2019s as dirty as I am.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut not as impatient as I am.\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Hilvia let go of her hand and backed away from Verndia\u2019s smirk.She\u2019s a girl with a similar personality to the Duke.She was an unheard-of figure, but there was no room for deliberation of who-is-that-girl, the words of the Duke himself are already an evidence.\u201cShe is looking for the\u2026. Duke. If you were caught-\u201c\u201cPretty man, I love you!\u201dHilvia, who became contemplative, ran away without looking back. She was so rushed that she even dropped her debt and went.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201dIf she had known that it was that easy.When it was only the two of them left, Psychke broke the magic of the bracelet.She didn\u2019t expect it to last this long, but he had to ask Lia again for this kind of help.\u201cIs my personality that bad?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dShe can\u2019t say that he\u2019s good when his words are emotionless. Psychke didn\u2019t say anything.Verndia shifted the subject, whether he was expecting an answer from her or not.\u201cWhy does it smell so\u2026 Princess, did you smoke?\u201d\u201cNo. But have you heard the story?\u201d\u201cA story? Ah, that stupid talk.\u201dIt is said that the Duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is famous for her dirty conduct.Didn\u2019t he already tell her to be careful because sometimes leaving the house late at night seems to be connecting with another man\u2026?\u201cDuke. Your hands are bleeding.\u201d\u201cNot my blood.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere was one bastard.\u201dVerndia took off her blood-stained gloves with a nonchalant face.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let her go that way, but I forgot as I was searching for you. But why are you holding that?\u201dHis gaze was on Psychke\u2019s left hand- the hand that held her earring.Psychke untied the earring she had been holding on to until then and handed it over to him.\u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve it.\u201dAs if she did not understand her words, Verndia gently tilted his head.\u201cSuddenly?\u201d\u201cI just found out it was the \u2018Tears of the Wave\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026 This?\u201dAs if he didn\u2019t really know, Verndia, who was looking into the earrings, also had a slightly surprised face.\u201cWhy is this here?\u201d===TN: I misunderstood it. In chapter 38, I accidentally tled it as if Hilvia was talking to another man. I greatly misunderstood it as if Psychke overheard Hilvia asking for Verndia\u2019s hand in marriage. Ah, forgive me. Now that I realize it, it was funny that Hilvia saw Psychke as a man. lmao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He also recalled that he quickly demanded his aide about accessories that could be used as a sword, or weapon; should be small and can be hand-carried.He also remembered the time when she signed a report that the highest-grade Magic Stone is needed for what he desires to be made for Psychke. Then that moment when he was signing some documents which reported that it is not simply enough to use the best quality of Magic Stone in order to make it in the near future, and that what is needed is the best there is in the currency\u2026.Therefore, it must be the \u2018Tears of the Waves.\u2019(TN: The effort tho. Btw, Verndia is actually a red flag but I my eyes can\u2019t seem to differentiate red to other colors ehee~)\u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dHaving finished understanding the situation, Verndia said calmly.This is originally purchased to deal with monsters/beasts.Thanks to his fianc\u00e9e, he was able to purchase the Tears of the Waves, and he has no regrets.It was Psychke who was astonished by the unexpected simplicity.\u201cYou can\u2019t help it\u2026?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you? This can only be used by you, Princess.\u201d\u201cNo, there must be another way\u2014\u201d\u201cThere is not.\u201dThe collected Verndia picked up her earring while she took a few steps back to avoid him approaching her.\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t know it was that expensive.\u201d\u201cWhy is the Princess sorry?Verndia asked her, who didn\u2019t really understand her reaction.\u201cI was the one who told you to use it. If\u00a0it wasn\u2019t for the Princess, this would have been rotted away in a warehouse anyway.\u201dHis eyes were sincere. Still, Psychke had no intention of receiving it after knowing how expensive it was.Even if she adds up all the belongings she brought from Silkisia, it wouldn\u2019t be worth 100, 000 golds at all.Or five million gold.On top of that, 50 million gold\u2026\u201cIf you don\u2019t take it, I will throw it away.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dShe then hurriedly reached out to the earring in a dash.Then, after his gentle laughter, she realized that he was just lying. It was already too late when Verndia covered her hand which was about to get her earring.\u201cIf you feel burdened, how about if you think that it is the price of our unequal transactions?\u201d\u201cUnequal\u2026 transactions?\u201d\u201cOur break-up contract. The princess has done many things for me, but I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201dHe smiled softly and handed the earring.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay because I suggested it first. If you just break the marriage right away\u2014\u201d\u201cI am not fine. Because I can\u2019t live without paying my debt.\u201dVerndia, as before, put on earrings and tidied her hair. And whispered his soft voice.\u201cPretty.\u201dHer face seemed to heat up by his words. Inexplicable emotion suddenly hit her chest.Why is he doing this? Psychke tilted her gaze at an angle.The cold touch of the metal and the warm touch that started from his fingers strangely blended and remained in her ears.\u201cBut this is\u2026 too much\u2026\u201d(TN: But you\u2019re clearly blushing tho~ *wink*)\u201cIt\u2019s not overdone. To be honest, I think this is already cheap. Didn\u2019t the princess solve a problem that money couldn\u2019t solve?\u201dAs he said those words, Verndia looked somewhat lonely.But that emotion was gone in the blink of an eye.\u201cMore than that, Princess, do you have anything more to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201dHe did not adapt to the rapidly changing atmosphere.For some reason, looking at the man with an expectant expression on his face, Psychke, who had been fiddling with her earring, blinked her eyes. Her heart couldn\u2019t stop beating fast. It was strange.And bowed his back.\u201cI will use these well. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut looking at his face, it didn\u2019t seem like it was about the earring.Psychke blinked again and opened her mouth.\u201cThings weren\u2019t like that with Young Lady Eslando.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThen, he pressed his temple a bit impatiently.\u201cIt\u2019s just the discussion we talked about earlier.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Oh, are you talking about the \u2018lover\u2019 topic?\u201dVerndia shook his head.Psychke looked around her to make sure there was no one there, and said jokingly.\u201cIt was my fault for having a lover\u2019s fortune in the presence of other people\u2019s eyes. However, as the Duke said before, we have nothing to do with-\u201d\u201cNot that!\u201dVerndia was very annoyed.\u201cWhy are we not in any relationship?\u201d\u201c\u2026 We\u2019re engaged. However-\u201c\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t there be a minimum of courtesy to be shown to each other?\u201d\u201cAny minimum courtesy?\u201d\u201cAt least during our engagement period.\u201d\u201cYes, courtesy for the both of us. But the word lover was first used by the Duke-\u201c\u201cWhen did I do that?\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dSpeaking so proudly, Psychke even thought for a moment that her memory was wrong.\u201cI never did.\u201d\u201cNo, in the past, the Duke said it doesn\u2019t matter if I have a lover, so be honest.\u201d\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it. Do you understand?\u201d(TN: Stawp, my heart- Just kiss-\u2026 oopss\u2026 it was a slip of my tongue\u2026)\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dEven if she didn\u2019t stare at him like that, she didn\u2019t intend to make something like a lover.\u201cGood. Are you done with going to errands?\u201dVerndia, who relaxed his expression as if he was about to go home, held out his hand.To him, who looked strangely satisfied, Psychke told the story of the doll kingdom.(TN: Did they\u2026 uhm, hold each other\u2019s hand???)* * *As an event for children, the starting place of \u2018The Doll Kingdom\u2019 was cutely decorated.Everywhere she looked, fragrant fresh flowers and colorful balloons were full.Gorgeous firecrackers embroidered the blue sky, and animated, forearm-sized dolls led the guests.[It\u2019s here, here!]A fox doll with a sky-blue balloon was pulled to the collar to follow.Looking at it, it seemed like he was thinking of taking her to the puppet show that was taking place in the center of the venue.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dPsychke gently pushed the doll\u2019s hand away.Croa, a crow flying over her head, chirped. It was put on by Verndia.\u2018When you go alone, you get hurt every day. So, can\u2019t we go together in the afternoon?\u2019After hearing about the situation, Verndia freed the crow to help her find the mercenary named Dellas. And so the crow went to the Festival with Psychke.However, Lia, who arrived early in the morning with a forbidden magic gun, caught her by the ankle.\u2018Isn\u2019t it like finding a needle in a desert? I think it\u2019d be better if there was at least one more person. Oh, you said you\u2019d cross-dress if you couldn\u2019t find it, right? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll follow you as soon as it\u2019s over. Don\u2019t get hurt.\u2019The reason why attacking Asum is difficult is that there is something hidden in the rear, but it was more important to get the attacker\u2019s gender.So, if they can\u2019t find a mercenary, Lia joked that she should dress up Verndia as a woman.When she thinks of him trembling that moment, it still makes her laugh. She didn\u2019t know that an arrogant man could make such a face.\u2018It\u2019s surprising anyway. It\u2019s about the territory, so I thought he\u2019d leave everything behind.\u2019Apparently, Verndia valued forbidden magic as much as the Lestir estate.\u2018He\u2019s not even a worshiper, so why\u2026\u2019\u2013 Kaaack!Her thoughts were disturbed by the harsh cry. Croa\u2019s crimson eyes were staring straight at her.This time, she said that she would not obey her, with heartbroken eyes.She was told to stay still, so she paid tribute to Verndia, so it\u2019s only natural.\u201cI am not fighting today. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dIn disbelief, Croa wept as if grunting.\u2018By the way, can this crow even understand me?\u2019Because of her, Verndia, who seems to be talking to his crow, the crow was also talking to her naturally from time to time.\u2018The Duke is raising him, so this must be smart.\u2019Psychke, who looked away from the raven-looking crow, was troubled all over the place.\u2018Where should I go?\u2019She first decided to walk along the straight path.A mercenary named Dellas said that he wraps his whole body tightly in any season.Just like the nomads living in the western desert.It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s winter, but now it\u2019s summer.Wouldn\u2019t it be noticeable from a distance if he is wrapped up like that?Perhaps she could find him sooner, Psychke held a small hope.But that hope was soon shattered.\u2018Too many people.\u2019Because it was a festival that was considered one of the largest in the Empire, there were so many people who looked like they came from the desert.\u2018How do I find Dellas?\u2019He probably wouldn\u2019t even be holding a weapon as it was forbidden to bring in weapons, and the portrait given by the information guild was just the forehead and eyes.Disappointed, Psychke narrowed the corners of her eyes. Then she saw unexpected figures about ten steps away.\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant. Are you saying you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cIs it possible? Do you know how much I depend on Duke?\u201dThe man was Yzhar, and the woman was the wizard Shiona she had seen before.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Psychke turned quietly so as not to be noticed by them, especially Yzhar.She has already thought that she might run into one of Silkisias\u2019.It was because of Lillian, who liked dolls to the point that she felt like she was a maniac.\u2018It was amazing that dead things moved.\u2019\u2018Can a dead person move like a doll with magic?\u2019In the past, it was Lilian\u2019s \u2018impression\u2019 of visiting the doll kingdom.The expression of the doll as dead was something that she had been remembering all this time because it was somehow creepy.\u2018At that time, I remember my brother, Lenox, Melissa, and the four of us went there. Why is there only Yzhar today?\u2019When she noticed, Lilian, Lenox, and Melissa didn\u2019t seem to be nearby.Did they come separately?Or did the three not come from the beginning?She couldn\u2019t figure it out.Anyway, she came here today because of something that had nothing to do with them. Psychke thought without hesitation.\u201cPrincess?\u201dAnd she ran into another unexpected person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His bright red eyes resemble the sun, blazing overhead. Sir Aiden was looking down at her with his startled eyes.He seemed fine as long as he hadn\u2019t been attacked by other magical beasts. If she looks at him closely, he seems to have a better complexion than when he was a private soldier of Silkisia.\u2018What a relief. He\u2019s in good condition.\u2019Psychke looked at him from afar and bowed her back.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been well. I\u2019m really sorry about what happened in Silkisia.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not the princess\u2019s fault.\u201dAide was embarrassed by what she did, so he waved his hand. Still, she continued apologizing and quickly changed the subject.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I came to play. What about you, Sir Aiden?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I also came to play.\u201dEven though both of them were dressed far from those people who came to actually enjoy the festival.Aiden looked down at Psychke\u2019s clothes, which were optimized for running, and looked down at an angle.\u201cDo you have companions?\u201d\u201cI am alone.\u201d\u201cI see. May I walk with you for a moment?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, we can talk for a while.\u201dIt\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve seen each other, and since they separated vaguely at the end, he had a lot to say to Psychke.But she felt that it is more important to search for Dellas first than having a walk with him. Aiden said it was fine after his offer was rejected by her.\u201cHow are your injuries?\u201d\u201cThey are all right.\u201dPsychke answered, staring intently at the two nomads watching the dancing lion puppets.Aiden stared guiltily at the area around her wounded arm.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to get you involved in something strange.\u201d\u201cNo. But Sir Aiden, how are you?\u201dPsychke asked, looking at the nomads standing in front of the place where they made puppies out of balloons.Aiden looked at her and her gaze to where she was looking.\u201cYes, thanks to the princess, I\u2019m doing very well.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do-\u201dAt that moment, a group of desert nomads passed by them.Psychke quickly glanced at them. An adult man and a woman and two children appear as a family.It may or may not look like the eyes in the portrait\u2026Suddenly, she thought that she would never find the mercenary Dellas in this way.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Psychke clenched her fists. In the first place, it was unreasonable to try to find someone with a portrait with only the name and eyes.If so, the rest is\u2026\u201cAre you looking for anything?\u201dAiden, who had been standing still, spoke. But Psychke bit her tongue. They have a rough relationship, but Aiden was feeling that he needs to help Psychke.\u201cI am looking for someone. If you are not busy, can you help me?\u201d\u201cI think I can only help you for two hours\u2026 would that be all right?\u201dSaying thank you for his help, Psychke pulled out a portrait.Aiden pulled his body closer to confirm it.Croa roared loudly above her head as if it was about to fall.\u201cThis is Dellas, a mercenary from the West. He came here today, and it\u2019s a little hard for me to find here with these alone.\u201d\u201cDellas?\u201dDellas, Dellas.Aiden, who was pondering the name of the mercenary in his mouth while looking at the portrait, made a strange expression.\u201cAre you talking about Stella?\u201d\u201cStella?\u201dIf he was asking about the Stella she knew, then maybe the head of the Western Nomads and the owner of the \u2018Silent Land\u2019?Aiden nodded his head, indicating that her guess was correct.\u201cNo, I\u2019m looking for Dellas.\u201d\u201cI changed it a bit to an anagram. This is the method Stella uses often when she comes up with a pseudonym.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Does he work as a mercenary?\u201d\u201cI heard that he sometimes uses a pseudonym when bored.\u201dPsychke looked up at him from a distance, with enough intelligence to tell him to go away from any information guild.Aiden scratched his cheek shyly.\u201cIt\u2019s because of our personal friendship. I came here today to see him too. \u2026if it\u2019s not rude, may I ask why you\u2019re looking for him?\u201d\u201cI have something I would like to request. Could you please introduce me to him?\u201dIt\u2019s a personal friendship.She doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019d accept the request, but it was an opportunity to ask for his help.With delight, Psychke unknowingly grabbed the hem of his robe.Aiden was startled that he took a deep breath and his body slightly trembled.\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026. No.\u201dAiden, with his cheeks raised, led her to a bench nearby. The teddy bears who had been sitting on the bench were moved away.One of the girls left, drawing a heart with her hand, perhaps mistaken them as a couple.\u2013 Kaaack!Aiden\u2019s face turned red. Croa wept harshly towards the teddy bear as if in a bad mood.\u2018Do you hate teddy bears?\u2019Psychke, unable to see the heart, stroked the crow sitting on her lap which means that this crow better calm down.\u201cDoes Aiden know where he is?\u201d\u201cYes. He is going to see a puppet show.\u201dA puppet show.If she had followed the fox at the entrance, she would have met Stella.\u2018But I may not recognize him either.\u2019Without knowing the shape of his face, it was no for sure that she would recognize him just with eyes.\u201cI can\u2019t get in during the performance\u2026 I have about an hour left.\u201dAiden took out his pocket watch and murmured.When he said he had an hour to spare, Psychke looked around leisurely.Children holding balloons in one hand and living dolls in the other, walking and even running happily.Adults looked at such children with joy.Fresh flowers blooming between the roads and butterflies flying over them\u2026\u201cI am glad that you are doing well.\u201dPsychke turned her head at the gentle voice she heard from him.\u201cYou look a lot better than when you were in Silkisia.\u201d(TN: That\u2019s because she\u2019s under Verndia\u2019s care *insert blesses emoji*)Aiden smiled softly at her.\u201cI was worried because there were rumors of a discord.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dRumors spread like a snowball in the alleyways and fountains. She then concluded that those rumors increased when she went for a walk.Again, bad news spreads faster than good news.\u201cIt must be a false rumor. I know. The Duke said that it was because of the princess that he took my convenience.\u201d\u201cThe duke?\u201dThe one who went mad when he heard the story of Hillace?Psychke\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYes. It is thanks to the duke that we are able to walk around like this. Instead, I was told not to approach the princess.\u201dAs if in trouble, Aiden smiled at me.\u201c\u2026The Duke also tested me, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take this much.\u201d\u2018Test?\u2019She thought about what it meant, but nothing came to her mind. So, she thought it would be something between the two of them. Anyway, she was glad that he was doing well. But again, she was still concerned.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at it that way.\u201dAiden smiled sweetly, as if trying to relieve her guilt.\u201cAs I said before, it\u2019s not the princess\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You said you came to Silkisia to see me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAiden nodded softly.\u201cYou never appear in any social circles, and you never accepted my invitation to see you even though I\u2019ve personally asked you to meet me a few times.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for\u2026 being shy\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault for asking so much. I was thinking about what to do, so I applied for enlisted soldiers.\u201dA light wind blew.Aiden looked at the silver hair that was scattered across her cheeks, and then softly touched her lips.\u201cIs the promise to go to the temple still valid?\u201d\u201cYeah, but can I go ahead and ask what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Princess\u2026\u201dAfter waiting for a long time, Aiden raised his voice with difficulty.\u201cDo you remember your childhood?\u201d\u201cMy childhood?\u201d\u201cBefore you were adopted by Silkisia.\u201dMemories before her adoption\u2026Only memories that cannot be recognized, such as dungeons, darkness, hunger, and fear, remained in these fragments. She shook her head, not wanting to reflect on the wounds buried deep inside.\u201cI see. Then, do you know about the Leas case?\u201d\u201cYes, I know that.\u201d\u201cI think the princess is the victim of that incident.\u201d\u201cA victim?\u201dShe forgot the conversation she had with Verndia about that incident. Hence, she wondered what this for\u2018By the way, the Duke also said that at first glance of me.\u2019That she is the victim of the Leas case.That\u2019s when she wanted to find out more about what the hell it was.\u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201dA shrill scream echoed from behind. Psychke and Aiden looked back at the same time.Black smoke rose from the central tent where a delightful puppet show should be taking place.One side was abnormally swollen, as if something was about to pop out.***Near the tent was chaos.\u201cIan! Where are you? Ian!\u201dParents who called their children so desperately that they are crying loudly,\u201cAacck! Mom!\u201dThe dust that covered the kid from his head down to her toes was yelling in cries. The crying child bumped into a man and fell. The man who had been hugging his child only looked back at him with guilt but did not help.Thump, Thump.The ground shook.One side of the tent seemed to inflate strangely, and a huge hand popped out with a booming, ripping sound. Soon after, a giant fox doll appeared from the inside of the tent. It was the doll she saw at the entrance.Surprised, Psychke took a breath.[If you go out during the puppet show\u2026 there is no way you can.]The fox doll reached out to the fallen child. The black shadows on the floor gradually grew bigger.\u201cThis.\u201dAiden threw his body and saved the child. His golden hair swayed precariously as it was only brushed against his side and huge hands.[Quickly\u2026 Come in\u2026]Aiden disappeared, offering to take the child to a safe place.Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.Again, a huge shadow fell.Psychke lifted her head at the sound of the seams bursting from above. And she doubted her own eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was so huge that the ground shook just by walking.[ \u201cPlease come back\u2026\u201d ][During the performance\u2026 if you move\u2026 you can\u2019t\u2026]\u201cMoooom!! Aaaahh!\u201d\u201cPlease save this person!\u201dPeople were running frantically and hurriedly. The gigantic dolls were scattered along them. Psychke wanted to follow along with the running people, but she stopped. There were many people who needed her help more than anyone. It seemed that their case was more urgent than she was.\u201cTh, thank you!\u201d\u201cPerhaps, have you seen my child?\u201d\u201cThere was a child crying over there looking for his mother, so please go there.\u201dAfter taking care of those people who could have been trampled on by huge hands and feet, the surrounding area was empty. Aiden only came back after the last doll had crawled out. He seemed to come to help the people who might be in trouble with the dolls scattered all over the place. Psychke asked him whilst he panted.\u201cDid Stella come too?\u201d\u201cNo. If only she had returned.\u201dAiden stared at the tent as if looking at visible objects. Tents that had been blown up here and there had turned into an abominable form as if they were about to fall anytime now.\u201cI am certain you\u2019re searching for the cause of this fuss.\u201dPsychke nodded her head gently. The count of people who were preventing the dolls to scatter was lacking. Rather, it would be more efficient if Stella came to help them. Aiden said that the sudden fire came and went.She tried to head inside the tent.\u2013 Kkkyaacck!However, Croa bit her clothes and did not let her go.\u201cLet go of this.\u201dIt shook its head. Croa was so desperate that black feathers flew in the air. If Psychke went inside there and was injured, Croa was afraid that Psychke\u2019s body will filled with repercussions.\u201cI\u2019m just going to check what\u2019s there.\u201dCroa shook its head in disbelief. Psychke sighed softly, then pressed her finger against her sharp beak.\u201cAaayaa!\u201dShe even shouted in such a way that she deliberately told Croa to obey her words.\u00a0 Croa opened her beak as she saw the drops of blood rising from the tip of Psychke\u2019s finger.\u201cThis is what you did.\u201d\u2026 . (Croa was stunned to say a thing.)\u201cIf you don\u2019t interfere, I\u2019ll spare you from here.\u201d\u2013 \u2026 Kaaack! (So, the symbol (?) \u2018-\u2018 here, in the middle of apostrophes indicates Croa\u2019s answer.)Psychke succeeded in negotiating with Croa. As she approached the tent, she picked up the torn cloth and checked the inside. It was dark and no one was there. Fortunately, the support of the tents didn\u2019t break, so it didn\u2019t look like it would collapse right away.\u201cStella?\u201dAiden, who was next to her, called carefully. But there was no answer returned.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. There\u2019s no way Miss Stella ran away.\u201d\u201cShall we go in?\u201d\u201cI left my sword and came here\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI have.\u201d\u201cThen I think it would be good to just check it out.\u201dThey were vigilant and went in. As they got closer, they could clearly see that it had been shredded. Pieces of wood that would have been made as chairs and lost belongings were rolling all over the place. The stage in front of where the puppet show was supposed to be held was completely turned off and broken.While the two of them dispersed to check inside, Croa flew to the podium above the stage. It sounded like a sharp stinging sound.\u201cPrincess, here-\u201dBefore long, Aiden, who was checking the immersed stage, called her.\u201cIt\u2019s a magic circle.\u201dWhere he pointed was an ominously sparkling magic circle. It was painted with blood, so the color was dark red.\u201cIt might be dangerous, so it\u2019s best not to get too close.\u201d\u201cIt would be better to call people here.\u201dAs strangers to magic, there was nothing more they could do. It was then that Aiden, who agreed with her, was about to step away from her, heard,Kwaaang!The sculptures from the ceiling, which were barely hanging, fell onto the magic circle. The magic circle flashed ominously. As if it were the mouth of a snake, it opened wide from side to side, creating a black entrance. The sculpture fell into the darkness of the magic circle. After a while, there was no sound hitting the floor.\u201cIsn\u2019t this why this Magic Circle is in here?\u201dHow deep is that? Psychke made a tired voice. Aiden answered with a trembling voice as if he was thinking the same thing.\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u2013 Kaack!Croa pulled at her collar as if he really wanted to go now. She motioned yes and fixed her gaze on the hole of the magic circle as she slowly backed away.\u201cCroa!\u201dIn an instant, a sticky black hand came out of the abyss and tied Croa. Psychke was so stunned but instinctively and reflexively snatched Croa away from the devil.\u201cPrincess!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come!\u201dCroa, each holding its body and wings, groaned in pain. She wanted to pull out her sword and cut the black hand, but it was too far away. If she loosened even one hand, she was afraid Croa will fall deep down. Aiden threw things at random. It was to no avail, nothing happened. As if swallowed by darkness, it seeped into the inside of the black hand.\u201cCall people here!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHurry up!!\u201dThe black hand that was pulling Croa began to entangle Psychke\u2019s hand as well.\u201cI can\u2019t last long, hurry!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come soon\u2026 I\u2019ll be here soon!\u201dAiden ran out in despair. But it was quicker for the black hands to cover her hand than it was for Aiden to return.\u201cAaah!\u201dThe limp foot fell off the ground.She was dragged along with Croa into the darkness where she could not see an inch ahead.***Meanwhile, around that time.\u300c\u201dShiona Tuberose, mainly uses plants for power and is especially good at hallucinations and mental systems.\u201d \u300dIt was after Lia left. Verndia was scanning the personal information of a wizard. He was brought by Lia, who said that the skill written was most similar to the wave of forbidden magic left in the alley.\u201cHey, Duke. It\u2019s a question I don\u2019t understand.\u201dAs he was contemplating what to do, Isolet interrupted. He doesn\u2019t like to be disturbed while deep in thought but it was rare for Isolet to ask such a question. Verndia shook his head to ask a question in return.\u201cWhy are you looking for Keitan\u2019s necklace?\u201d\u2018I thought it had something to do with forbidden magic, but it was something else.\u2019Before she left, Lia said she had found any moves regarding Keitan\u2019s necklace and she said she would let him know sooner or later. Isolet must have heard of that and did this. When Verndia didn\u2019t say anything, Isolet continued with a voice mixed with wonder and concern.\u201cI know there are some questionable aspects to the case of Leas, which ended in a rush, but I wonder if the Duke needs to step in.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cBecause all of Silkisia\u2019s direct lines are dead.\u201dIsolet answered without hesitation. He did not know the contract Verndia had signed with Leah (This is the different Leah), nor did he know the identity of Psychke. Therefore, he did not understand his master who was interested in the Leas case.\u201cIt won\u2019t change as long as Leas\u2019s frame is lifted. What\u2019s the use if all of his direct lineages are dead? You\u2019ll only be hated by His Majesty because you\u2019re digging for things that are all over.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to get out of this because there\u2019s nothing to gain.\u201d\u201cYes. To be honest, I don\u2019t even know why the Duke wants to attack Silkisia.\u201dAs Isolet, he couldn\u2019t help but be puzzled. If the case of Leas was re-investigated in search of her necklace, the one who suffers the most is the current Silkisia. Is the Duke trying to attack the family of the princess whom he has in mind? He knew that Psychke\u2019s relationship with Silkisia wasn\u2019t that bad. Either way, they are one family. When the situation reaches its climax, will the princess just keep watching?After reading Isolet\u2019s thoughts, Verndia laughed.\u201cYes, it might look like that.\u201d\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s not an attack?\u201d\u201cIt may or may not be true.\u201dVerndia rose from his seat. He had prepared to go out to follow Psychke to the doll kingdom. And strode to his confused aide. Lia and Psychke couldn\u2019t talk about it, so they were going to make the aide understand in a different way.\u201cCan I tell you an interesting story?\u201dRecently, it was the information he got while poking around with Lia who was trying to run away again. As always, she withdrew from him, saying it was just something she had to do, but Verndia thought she was pretty credible.\u201cWhat if Keitan\u2019s necklace wasn\u2019t actually a poison sting necklace?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dIsolet turned to him with his puzzled face. The fact that Keitan\u2019s necklace, known as the poison sting necklace, could actually be an ordinary necklace\u2026 He had never thought about it.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I heard that 20% of those who attended the banquet that day witnessed poisonous stings coming out of it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard something else. You should not believe until you see the real thing.\u201dIsolet\u2019s mouth slowly opened.If that were true, that would have been a huge thing. Because it means that the event that destroyed a country\u2019s dukes was someone\u2019s conspiracy. When this happens, it becomes important to who (the mastermind/criminal) and why the person did it, regardless of whether the Duke\u2019s family survived or not.And\u2026\u201cLestir has more enemies than Silkisia has.\u201d(TN: Man was too honest, haha.)Isolet understood what Verndia was trying to say. Because Psychke had told him, she knew the problem too. The characteristics of the monsters running wild in the North. They are unusually weak against the cold and strong against the heat, she said. It\u2019s like someone caught the monsters living in the south, put a protective barrier on them, and released them there.\u201c\u2026 Duke, do you think the next target is Lestir?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, take care of everything while I am away.\u201d\u201cAre you leaving me behind?\u201dUnintentionally, Isolet\u2019s mouth widened when he saw where the master had made a demand already.\u201cCan\u2019t I just go too?\u201d\u201cThen, do everything before you play. Who was the one who pulled me back saying I had a lot to deal with?\u201d\u201cNo, I knew that the princess would come to visit!\u201d\u201cHer. Now even the princess became your excuse.\u201dVerndia laughed wildly. Then he hardened his face in an instant.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHis agitated gaze reached the ring finger of his left hand. As if anything had happened, his engagement ring was in place. Verndia fumbled his ring. He tried pulling to nothing happened. Then when he was sure that the ring wasn\u2019t even moving, he made a trembling voice.\u201c\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cWhat is the problem, Duke?\u201dIsolet, nervous about the sudden change of the atmosphere, approached him.\u201cNot located.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe princess\u2019s location is not being determined.\u201dWhen his words fell out of his mouth, he checked her location again. He couldn\u2019t. She was never caught anywhere in the world. Is this even possible?\u201c\u2026 Croa.\u201dHe contorted his face as he contemplated many possibilities with his firm face. He hurriedly ran out of the room and ordered.\u201cCall Croa. Now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Psychke lowered her head to motion him not to touch her. She curled up like shrimp. \u00a0Then the touch that was poking her cheek disappeared, and her hot breath reached her ears.\u201cWake up, you stupid princess.\u201d\u201c\u2013!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that big word, but she got goosebumps. She sprang to her feet, sick of the touch she was feeling.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to wake up.\u201dIt was dark around. However, thanks to the moonstone, which rolled out of her pocket, she was able to distinguish objects. This was from Cecil. It was a child in a black sweater who woke her up. \u00a0His shoulder-length hair was black, and his eyes were scarlet. The child\u2019s gender felt ambiguous.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201dA cage was seen behind the child who blurted his words coyly. She was trapped.\u2018Dungeon\u2026 no, I don\u2019t think so. Where am I?\u2019She kept asking herself, but she just gave up, having lost her mind. Something was stuck in Psychke\u2019s hand, who was about to get up with one hand on the sick head and the other on the floor. It was Croa\u2019s feather.\u2018Where\u2019s Croa?\u2019\u201cCroa?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dShe called to find where was Croa, but it was the child who answered her. She looked at the child closely, calling Croa again, hoping that her notion was not true.\u201c\u2026Croa?\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep calling me?\u201dPsychke was quite shocked. Croa was a crow male. She heard that due to human persecution, all the Suin are hiding in the eastern forest.(TN: Suin, Suin is a person who discovered the fire in Chinese ancient myths. It is one of the triple Oze. The picture depicting him has three eyes.)\u2018Why is Suin here?\u2019\u201cPrincess, did you not hear me?\u201dPsychke narrowed her brows in a rude tone the child gave her.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know you were Croa.\u201d\u201cOh, why don\u2019t you know that? It\u2019s annoying.\u201dSomething hot burst into tears underneath the child\u2019s eyes. The way he speaks strangely resembles Verndia in case someone told him that he was not the crow.\u2018Should I have just let you be taken away?\u2019Ignoring the squeaking crow, Psychke looked around at her situation. Then, she made eye contact with a woman who was comforting the children who were crying in the corner of the cage opposite.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hello.\u201dShe answered a greeting that was not appropriate for the time and place they were in. The woman who raised herself slowly approached.\u201cWho are you? I don\u2019t think I know you. How did you get here\u2026?How did it come to this? Her voice contained a subtle surprise. Psychke brought the moonstone forward. The subtle light vaguely confirmed the other person\u2019s features. Brown eyes that look like land in a desert-like ocher-colored hair. He has warm eyes that look just like a portrait, and even the unique clothes of a Western nomad who is wrapped up all over his body.(TN: Stella is a man????)\u201cMiss Stella?\u201d\u201cHush.\u201dStella put her index finger on her lips.(TN: So, he\u2019s she.)The gold bracelets on the wrists collided and made a clear sound.\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d\u201cI came into the magic circle that was on stage.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a child, are you? No one but a child can come in. That\u2019s weird\u2026 \u201dStella, who tilted her head, now looked at the cage as if it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cCan you break it?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to try, but isn\u2019t it possible for you, Stella?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no land.\u201dThere\u2019s no land? \u00a0Psychke looked down at what she was stepping on. It was just as black as a cut in the dark.\u201cI think the coordinates are twisted.\u201dOh, I see. As long as one foot touch the ground, nothing in the world can beat Stella. On the contrary, it means that she is just an ordinary person when there is no land. She doesn\u2019t know if this place is empty, underwater, or just twisted coordinates Stella said. At least it was clear it wasn\u2019t a normal place.\u2018Let\u2019s go out for now.\u2019It was when she took off her earrings and tried to transform Mana into a sword.\u201cPrincess, why did you lie?\u201d\u201c\u2026.?\u201dThe crow, who was playing with the moonstone, suddenly quarreled.\u201cYou\u2019re weak. You have no energy. To the point of being beaten.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt seemed to be talking about the time when she slapped Lennox.\u201cA weak kid can\u2019t break this. Why are you lying?\u201d\u201cGo away.\u201dPsychke pushed the crow away, who was playing hard to get. And raised her blue sword. Thanks to training with Verndia, she was able to create a sword above a certain level while suppressing her ability.\u201cOh\u2026?\u201dLeaving behind a startled voice, she swung her sword. The cage was cut off in vain with a creepy sound.***After leaving the prison, they walked in a dark hallway. Led by Psychke with the sword in her hands, Stella and ten children followed. And so the crow did.\u201cYou\u2019re very strong, princess.\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. My arm hurts because the princess pulled my arm.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it only hurt when I grabbed your arm?\u201d\u201cYes, it doesn\u2019t hurt more.\u201dThe crow hung dangling from his back in a human form.\u2018I think it\u2019s because his arm hurts that was why he was pretending to be sick, and he was just lazy to walk.\u2019Maybe because he was a crow. But he wasn\u2019t heavy, but she didn\u2019t feel good about this. Psychke sighed.\u201cWhy did you get hit when you were this strong? Father is mad at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Father?\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u2026 You\u2019re not calling him father, are you? Even though she thought so, Psychke couldn\u2019t turn her big eyes back. She didn\u2019t know her father had a hidden child.\u201cIt was your father, but a brother.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDad and brother were shocking names. Is there anyone who calls Verndia as brother? No, she doesn\u2019t know anyone who does that.\u2018Wait, the life of a Suin is several times that of a human being, and so late is in terms of appearance\u2026\u2019No, it\u2019s fine. Psychke decided to stop thinking.\u201cAnyway, come down. It\u2019s hard to use a sword if you\u2019re stuck like that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not holding a sword to me right now, are you?\u201d\u201cHold it.\u201dWas it because of the darkness that was thick enough to swallow even the light of the moonstone? Strangely enough, it was difficult to manage Mana. So, Psychke held the sword in the shape of an earring.\u201cIf you\u2019re lazy to walk, turn into a crow and sit on my shoulder.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dThe crow was disappointed, saying that he could not return to his true self after falling here.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bother, rather it\u2019s so hard to walk.\u201d\u201cThen hang on well so that you don\u2019t get in the way.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t grab my neck.\u201dThe hand that was trying to grab her neck with excitement instantly fell off. The child, who climbed up and put her arm on her shoulder, peeped out her head.\u201cPrincess, give me that.\u201dThe little finger pointed to the moonstone that lit the way. She heard that crows like shiny things, but even if he was a Suin, she should not give things easily. Psychke dropped her hand holding the moonstone far away from his shorthand.\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cWhy? I can find our way without it.\u201dWas it thanks to Suin\u2019s unique sensitivity? Even though they were going through this maze-like hallway in the darkness where only their feet could be seen, the crow was leading the way exactly, saying, \u201cLeft, right, left, center.She doesn\u2019t know what the guidelines are based on. A child who was running away in fear went the other way and was caught in an arrow trap and almost became a hedgehog. Psychke looked sideways at the back.\u201cBecause the children are scared.\u201dShe think this crow was about six or seven. The children were barely holding back their tears thanks to the faint light of the moonstone and Stella.\u201cI\u2019m not scared. Can\u2019t you just give it to me?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll give you something shinier later.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, when we go out, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dShe can\u2019t just give him anything unless they got out of here. Even if she asked for all the pieces she brought from Silkisia, she could give them generously. There\u2019s nothing she can see, but all she can hear is the sighing children and Stella\u2019s voice that comforts them. I don\u2019t know how long it had been or how long they had walked since they had already escaped from prison. All she could do was believe in the crow\u2019s sense of direction.\u2018I can\u2019t even locate the Duke.\u2019She tried to trace Verndia\u2019s location through the ring to help her escape, but it was in vain. She couldn\u2019t even tell the direction, let alone the distance, as if she had cut the connection with something sharp.\u201cReally? Really?\u201dWhether he knows they are in a bad condition or not. The crow jumped from behind. Psychke laughed helplessly.\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cPrincess, you\u2019re a very nice person!\u201dWhen he squeaked in prison, the excited crow rubbed his face on the back of her neck as if acting cute.\u201cYou smell just like my dad.\u201d\u201cSmell?\u201dAre you talking about the smell of his shampoo? She put her hair on her nose. There was no smell except for the faint scent of roses.\u201cYes. It was my first time seeing someone who smells like winter other than my dad, and it was amazing.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the smell of winter?\u201d\u201cWinter smell smells like winter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHehe, princess. I really like you. Do you want me to give you a good one?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even before she was finished saying.The child, (crow) kissed Psychke\u2019s cheek to the point where it sounded like a sip.\u201c\u2013!\u201dIt was the moment she looked back at the crow in panic.She thought her eyes were shaking, and the view, which was full of darkness, began to brighten up like an ordinary hallway.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dPsychke stopped walking and looked around. The pattern of the wall as well as the cracks were clearly visible. There was also an arrow floor trap at the end of one of the three forked roads in front.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dStella, who was following, asked. Judging from her words, she seemed to be the only one who had an abnormal phenomenon. By the way, the unknown change was not the end there.\u201cI\u2019m scared, Miss.\u201d\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201dThe small sniffing voices sounded clear as if they were speaking right next to them. Psychke checked the location of the children. The children were still just a few steps away, right next to Stella.\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe crow giggled with excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing from a Suin.\u201dShe knew from the literature. The blessing of the Suin is to be able to share the main ability of a Suin with another. She heard that one can\u2019t get it even if one gives hundreds of millions of won because Suin hates humans due to extreme persecution. She just got a great deal so easily.She recovered her mind and started again, but it didn\u2019t feel real. Psychke rubbed her cheek in bewilderment.From the changes that occurred in her body, this crow seemed to have developed the five senses by leaps and bounds.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one to receive it, so who cares?\u201d\u2018Father did that for Croa.\u2019It seemed to mean the yellow-eyed crow that was sometimes seen in Lestir.\u201cI wanted to do it for my dad, too. But Croa did it first. Bad guy.\u201dThe child struggled with his legs, saying, \u201cJust thinking about it makes me angry.\u201d Psychke, who was hit by his foot in the waist,\u201cI wanted to give it to someone as strong as my dad, as nice as my dad, but I couldn\u2019t find that person no matter how much I looked for him. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been able to do it for you.\u201d\u201cTh, thank you.\u201dPsychke stuttered. Her vision was dizzy because she was not adapted to the sensitive five senses.\u201cIf you\u2019re thankful, princess, don\u2019t go anywhere and play with me and dad forever. Got it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d(TN: This crow has some *intelligent* way of making Psychke stay, heh.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPsychke couldn\u2019t follow what Croa was saying. Croa must have mistaken that her brief stay at Lestir\u2019s residence was a lifetime. She was fortunate that she got the chance to correct the misleading misunderstanding, but it was hard for her end.Then, after having talked to him for a long time did she only have the chance to apologize.\u201cIt\u2019s a little strange here, princess.\u201dCroa, who was running around, tilted his head uncharacteristically. Psychke, who was walking on the floor, raised her eyes. A five-pronged road that looks similar to what they had seen so far. However, Croa\u2019s words that followed were different from before.\u201cThere\u2019s no way out.\u201d\u201cAre we going to die now?\u201d\u201cMooom!\u201dWhen she heard that there was no way out, children behind them burst into tears that they had endure for a long time. She didn\u2019t even get used to the blessing this Crow gave her. Not only she was filled with the cries of the children, but she also took a step back as if her heart would burst into when she heard an echo from somewhere.She felt nauseous.Psychke bent slightly and covered her mouth. Surprised, Croa jumped and stared at the children.\u201cYou\u2019re all so noisy. Shut up!\u201dBut the children cried louder.\u201cShii-\u201dCroa, who crumpled his face mercilessly, took something shiny out of his knit and put it on his hand. It was a pair of clothes that were so long that Psychke didn\u2019t know how they were hidden in his tiny clothes.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dPsychke caught Croa while she was vomiting in vain. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the anxiety like a child on the beach.\u201cI have to break it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMy dad said that. If there\u2019s no answer, break it all down. Then one will come out.\u201dDuke, what the hell did you teach to this crow? His blue eyes trembled.\u201cI hate it because my arm hurts, but I can\u2019t help it. Let\u2019s go out and get some medicine, princess. My dad doesn\u2019t like it when the Princess is sick.\u201dAfter finishing talking, Croa jumped up. No, she thinks it was more right to say that he flew up as if he had wings on his back. One foot, one foot. The stride was so big that it seemed to be flying, not walking.Croa ran around the wall surrounded by black energy, appearing like flat ground and cut out like paper. It was a heavy sound of destruction that made the sound of rumbling and crying of a child go away and seemed to tear the membrane apart.Psychke held on with her ears closed. Then, she clenched her teeth and raised her sword against a stone falling from the ceiling.\u201cCroa!\u201dThe crow was called, striking out a piece of stone falling on top of the children. While dissatisfied, Croa adjusted the location of the falling debris as Psychke wanted.\u201cThat child was Lestir\u2019s servant.\u201dIt was when she was leaning against the sword, covering her ears, and moaning in pain. She wasn\u2019t sure. She felt like she already got to know Croa by shouting out his name. Stella\u2019s eyes were filled with untimely curiosity.\u201cSo, are you Lestir\u2019s fiancee?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s why you were similar to him.\u201dA certain longing permeated Stella\u2019s face.\u201cYou must have had a hard time because of that kid.\u201d\u2018That kid?\u2019It was before she even thought about who the \u2018child\u2019 was. Coming closer, she held her sword tightly. The rough, and calluses hands that resembled the desert.\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dStella bowed her head apologetically. Psychke was dumbfounded because she couldn\u2019t figure out why she was acting like this all of a sudden.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong-?\u201d\u201cLook at this! There\u2019s a real guy coming!\u201dCroa said, as if crying, who was happily breaking the wall. All eyes were turned to one side. A man was walking out of the real road hidden behind the wall, which Croa found. His eyes were unfocused as if he had lost his mind, and he had a long iron sword in his hand.Standing in front of Croa, he lifted the sword high. He was in an awkward position like a person who had never held a sword before.\u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201dThe moment Croa saw a light from the other end, this child said\u201cDaddy!\u201dThen, a man popped out. Psychke, who understood the situation, frisked.\u201cNo, Croa!\u201d* * *Fortunately, the child\u2019s father, who appeared at the other end was not cut in two. Croa, who slammed the claw on the floor, grumbled, but only neutralized it as instructed by Psychke. Parents of other children who appeared later were treated in the same way.\u201cWe fell together, and we couldn\u2019t see the other end, so I wondered where they went. This is how you should use it.\u201dStella looked at the aisle that Croa had found with disgust. As if to imply that there was an enemy at the end, the passage was enveloped in deep darkness. It was too gloomy to go with the children. Croa hit her in the back of her head and tried to get away from those parents who fainted.It was because Psychke was not the one who did it. She then fixed the sword.\u201cTake care of the children here. I\u2019ll go inside.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what was inside, but she just couldn\u2019t wait for someone to rescue her. (TN: Raw\u2019s a bit so confusing but remember that Aiden was calling peeps to rescue her.)\u201cCroa, you\u2013\u201d\u201cI will follow the princess. My dad told me to protect the princess.\u201dPsychke nodded to mean to do as he pleases. The children and Stella left behind would be exposed defenselessly, but she didn\u2019t think it would be dangerous for them to come along.It was because of Stella\u2019s bizarre nonchalance. She must be hiding some last card, she guessed.\u201cPillace Astania.\u201dShe turned her head in surprise at the familiar sentence that was not unfamiliar at the same time. Stella remained silent as if what she had just said were hallucinations.\u2018Did I hear that wrong?\u2019Psyche handed the feldspar for the children. And headed for the aisle with Cro.\u201cBe careful.\u201dStella and the children who were left saw them off.* * *\u201cI didn\u2019t catch it well as I thought. What should I do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you just had to draw attention as I told you to raise the doll moderately.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know it would get that big. I\u2019m screwed.\u201dIt was a narrow room with a high ceiling. Unlike other places, the floor was stone. People wearing strange masks gathered around the huge magic circle in the center.Psychke, who hid behind the wall, couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the blood from young animals in the magic camp.\u2018If the magic was used with animal blood\u2026 then forbidden magic? Is this what made this place weird?\u2019\u201cCan\u2019t we catch these things at a different event?\u201d\u201cI made this magic circle, but it won\u2019t work. They said this was also hard to generate.\u201d\u201cBut why women? Why did you fall in where only kids could only fall?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. The coordinates must have caused an error, well.\u201d\u201cShould I have just killed him? Oh, I feel uncomfortable. I should ask him when he comes.\u201d\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s about time he comes.\u201dForbidden magic worshippers began betting on when he would come. Psychke looked at Croa hiding across the street. Croa mouthed silently.\u2018Is it him or something, are we going to wait until he comes?\u2019\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to wait and fight at once?\u2019Croa nodded as if he understood. But they had to revise the plan shortly after,\u201cThe signal is here.\u201dIt was because the red light suddenly blinks three times to fill the room. The forbidden magic worshippers had straight faces.\u201cI\u2019ll bring the things I\u2019ve locked up.\u201dThe man stood up and was approaching where the two were hiding. Psychke and Croa exchanged eyes. Before they were even discovered, Psychke hit his abdomen, and Croa cut his throat.Thump.The body that had left its soul fell to the floor. The eyes of the wizards inside turned to the entrance.\u201cWhat? How?\u201d\u201cYou said possession of weapons was prohibited!\u201dThose who were in a hurry soon came to their senses and shouted a spell. The young animals on the magic camp rose to tremble. Their red eyes were the same fake masquerade as seen at the auction house.\u201cI\u2019ll go to the left. Don\u2019t get hurt.\u201dCroa left her side, telling her not to get hurt. It seemed to be an active effort. Her heart fluttered with unnecessary worries. Responding to his warning, Psychke overpowered the enemies one by one. They were so weak that she didn\u2019t get to use her sword.\u201cWhy are you so strong?\u201d\u201cIs there anything else left?\u201d\u201cNo! This is all!\u201dThe worshippers raised themselves again by chanting a spell whenever a monster fell. However, as the mana ran out, the ferocity became weaker. In the end, he couldn\u2019t attack and almost collapsed as soon as he woke up.It seemed to be sorted out smoothly like that.\u201cTell me if you don\u2019t want to die. How do I get out of here?\u201dIt was time for her to cut the last trick. When he had dealt with one side, Croa threatened the wizard by putting her hand on the neck. The wizard teased with a blue face.\u201cI, I, do you think I\u2019ll tell you that?!\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201d\u201cThe Magic Circle.\u201dThe blade that was digging into the skin stopped. A trembling finger pointed to a wall in one corner. If one doesn\u2019t look carefully, there was a magic circle that was so small that you might think it was a pattern and was assimilated with the surroundings.\u201cTh, that thing, you can activate it in reverse.\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 am unable\u2026 He is only the person who can do that\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is the \u2018He\u2019 you\u2019re talking about?\u201dThe blade was red. The blood ran down from the wizard\u2019s body. However, the wizard did not open his mouth until the end, even though he had a horrified face. Psychke shook her head to say stop. They need to save at least one person to catch the main body. Croa, who made an impression, struck him in the back of the head and knocked him out.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cI am not sure.\u201dPsychke moved and carefully examined the magic circle drawn on the wall.\u2018If I break it, it will be destroyed, but I don\u2019t know what kind of reaction it will have once I hit it.\u2019She couldn\u2019t stop Croa from hitting the wizard, who was also lost in thought.\u201cWhen there was no answer, the only way is to break it. Let\u2019s break it down first! Let\u2019s go! Aaaahhhhh!!\u201dAs soon as the blade touched, a dark red spark splashed on the magic circle. Psychke was surprised and stepped back. Croa, who was flapping under the current, fainted for the first time with a crow-like scream.\u201c\u2026\u2026. \u201cIt was a truly an ignorant act. Still, it was helpful to know what a reaction was. To be sure, Verndia\u2019s power from Croa felt weak as the magic circle were slightly damaged. The twisted coordinates seemed to return to their original state. But it was obvious that doing the same thing would make her look like a stupid crow, the same as Croa.\u2018Is there any better way?\u2019It was time to move the fainted Croa to one side and agonize.\u201cI wondered what this fuss was about.\u201dShe didn\u2019t feel any movement for a while but there is something moving. It was same feeling when she encountered the beasts in the alley. She reflexively took her sword out and turned her back.\u201cIt\u2019s you again.\u201dA creepy voice like scratching a wall with fingernails. A man dressed like those fallen wizards stood at the entrance. A black mask with a black robe covering his whole body. Even his eyes were black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe opponent who swung the sword toward Psychke\u2019s hand muttered bitterly.\u201c\u2026\u2026 You even know how to use a sword?\u201d\u2018Is he someone I know?\u2019No, it didn\u2019t seem like that. Yzhar was the only one she knew with black aura And Yzhar was someone who did not know that it was an aberration. He died when he died, not one to break Imperial law.\u201cLooks like you need to beg.\u201dA black sword sprouted in his hand. He leaped at a speed unbelievable for a human being.Kwang!The man\u2019s black sword collided with her blue sword. Had it not been for Croa\u2019s blessing, she would not have reacted on time. Psychke left him surprise and attacked him at the moment. As if she couldn\u2019t believe it, her opponent\u2019s pupils which contained her, fluctuated greatly.\u201cHow did you?\u201dPsychke swung her sword without a word. Every time their swords collided, an explosive roar shook the air. Her ears hurt and her head was dizzy, but she was slowly getting used to the sensitive sensation and it was tolerable.\u201cWhy?\u201dEven in the middle of a frantic fight, he spat out incomprehensible words one after another.\u201cWhat is in you? Why can\u2019t I defeat you? Why?\u201dWhat can\u2019t he defeat her?\u2018Do I really know him?\u2019Because of that, the opponent\u2019s swordsmanship became familiar to Psychke. It\u2019s similar to Silkisia\u2019s, but not exactly the same. It was a swordsmanship that pursued only extreme destruction to the body without considering the body that the host uses.\u2018Who is he? Just who-\u2018Her thought did not last long. The man\u2019s thrilled and evil-like eyes seemed to be bloodshot through her, but the black aura around him grew thicker. He was about to strike a blow to her. Likewise, the magic circle that Croa scratched earlier came into Psychke\u2019s eyes as she tried to increase her strength. In an instant, a good idea came to her mind. She crept towards the magic circle on the wall so that the other person wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201cIf I can\u2019t get you over with\u2026\u201dLife dwelled in his eyes, which contained only Psychke\u2019s figure. He was so terrifying that most people wouldn\u2019t dare even face him.\u201cI can just get rid of you.\u201dWith formidable power, he struck down his sword. Psychke did not accept his sword. She pretended to be the opponent, only waiting for his blow, and then flung herself to the side at the moment his attack was about to hit her.Kwang!The sound of walls breaking could be heard. The sound of sparks popping filled the small space.\u201cAaaaaagh!\u201dThe man who dropped his weapon suffered. As a reaction to his body that broke the magic circle, a reddish-dark current rippled through. A chance was given to Psychke. Psychke raised her sword. She didn\u2019t want to end anyone\u2019s life. However, this man was very dangerous to allow living just like the monsters.She made up her mind. A ray of blue light rushed toward his heart. And right at that moment.\u201c\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, she thought my eyes were blurry, but her vision dropped sharply. The target disappeared, and a small black slope appeared.\u2018What is this-\u2018She was taken aback and lowered her sword, looking around. She then realized the identity of the black slope that appeared. It was the black shoes the other person was wearing.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLosing her words, she raised her gaze. Enormous shoes, pants, the hem of robes, and on top of them\u2014Her huge opponent was engulfed in sparks and was suffering. It doesn\u2019t seem like he was doing anything to stop it.\u2018Why did this happen? Is it the work of a wizard?\u2019Psychke looked back. There was no one. The wizard had lost his mind and fell.\u2018Are there any other wizards hiding with invisible magic?\u2019She sharpened her senses, but nothing bothered her. She even doubted whether her body was heavy or not having any symptoms of pain. While she was calmly checking the situation,\u201c\u2026. Ha.\u201dA mocking voice dripped from above, tormenting her eardrums. Is he already out? Psychke raised her head. Red sparks were popping out, but it was calmer than a moment ago.\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201dIt was a very long distance, but thanks to the Croa\u2019s blessing, she could see it clearly. Black eyes overflowing with joy as if they were not sure what to do with this situation.\u201cI wanted you to crawl like a bug, but never thought you would become a real bug.\u201dPsychke stopped her breathing. She thought he was just trying to kill her out of resentment. Then, she guess that wasn\u2019t it. She didn\u2019t know he would be happy. Her hair stood on end.\u2018Who are you really?\u2019She never thought there would be anyone other than Lillian who hated her so much. she thought she lived a quiet life. Wasn\u2019t that what it was, in fact? Her thoughts again didn\u2019t last long. It was because a huge shadow in the shape of a figure covered her eyes.She hurriedly escaped, but a huge sword like a mountain stuck in the ground blocked her way. She ran away from obstacles. If a piece of stone blocked her, she will attack the other part, and if there was an obstacle, she jumped over. She got out of the shadows overhead countless times. When the huge sword blocked her way again, she used her sword to shift its direction.However, there was a limit to avoiding the shadow with her small body. She must not use her body recklessly because there was a difference in size to using her powers, and it will be the end of her if her feet were frozen when dealing with wizards.\u201cHooh-\u201dHer breathing became rougher, matching the speed of the sword marks on the floor. At this rate, it was a situation where she had to use his abilities as a last resort. Psychke ran and ran to avoid the situation.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ugh!\u201dThen, near the knife mark, she was hit with a straight edge by debris that splattered, and she fell. Red blood oozes out through the torn clothes, but she doesn\u2019t know if it hurts. She stood up in a hurry, but unfortunately, the opponent was alert.\u201cBye.\u201dIt really didn\u2019t matter anymore. Looking at the growing shadow above her head, he raised his abilities with all his might. And at about the same time, the ground trembled.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt felt like an earthquake. The man lost his balance, he stumbled and rolled in the opposite direction. Psychke, too, was not centered at first. However, thanks to her smaller body, she came to her senses faster than the opponent she has.\u2018Stella!\u2019The floor was cracking as it spat out something like the cry of an angry beast. Rather than a sudden earthquake, it was more reasonable to assume that Stella, who was able to use her superpowers after the coordinates returned, was moving. Though worried about the children, she trusted her to take care of the situation right now. She was in a hurry just to get out of this place that was about to collapse.Due to the shock that damaged the magic circle, cracks were appearing everywhere, starting from the place where it connected to the floor. It rises, sinks, and jumps over huge gaping floors. It was difficult because of her small body, but fortunately, there was the awakened Croa nearby. The way she was looking around with one glance seemed to be unable to comprehend the situation yet.\u201cCroa!\u201dCroa, who gave his eyes to the sound source, opened his mouth wide. Then, \u2018Did you not wake up?\u2019 He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.\u201cWe have to get out!\u201dHe was indeed Verndia\u2019s henchman. Although Croa had a stupid expression, he saw the hole created by the damage. And without hesitation he returned to his raven form and carried her on her back.\u201cHow dare you run away?!\u201dThe man barely stood up holding onto the wall and screamed. However, he lasted less than 5 seconds before he fell to the floor again.[Shall I kill him?]Was it because Croa gave her a blessing? Cawing sounds have been converted into comprehensible sentences.\u201cNo, let\u2019s just go.\u201dThe shaking of the ground was getting worse. Correspondingly, the speed at which the cracks in the wall increased. If this is the case, the man will die on his own. They should escape urgently, and there was no time to waste. Just as he said, Croa rushed straight into the collapsed wall.\u201cPsychke!\u201dA desperate cry followed. The man chased Psychke. It was the last time she saw him screaming through the cracks in the collapsing space.***\u201cHave you found her yet?\u201d\u2013 Kaack\u2026.!A weak cry as if to apologize. Verndia gritted his teeth. The event venue, which was closed early due to an unfortunate incident, was broken and damaged here and there, making it a dreary place. It was all the more so because there was no moonlight in the sky. He glared at the tent where Psychke had disappeared.It swayed like a flag by the strong wind.\u201cIt\u2019s simple growth magic. That is completely beginner level.\u201dLia was groping for the wave of magic embedded in the doll that had grown in size. After her meeting with Verndia in the morning, she had gone away on business, and now she had crossed paths with the person who had called for her.\u201cIt looks like someone canceled the protection barrier on the doll.\u201cIt must be the imperial family.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLia felt terrified so she looked around to see if anyone had heard it. Fortunately, there was no one besides them and the crow.\u201cBe careful with your words.\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who can touch the imperial family event?\u201dThat was partly what Lia agreed with. However, there was no physical evidence but only evidence. According to the traces they just read, the person who used the magic was a young wizard who was not registered with the association. He is at the bottom of the list.\u201cForgive me. Because of me\u2026.\u201dAiden, who had come closer before they knew it, lowered his head. His face, which used to be beautiful even with all kinds of physical and mental suffering, was very damaged. Lia tried to comfort him by saying it wasn\u2019t his fault, but Verndia brusquely snapped at him.\u201cI heard she was right in front of you, didn\u2019t you catch her before?\u201d\u201cForgive me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t catch her, it\u2019s that you didn\u2019t catch her on purpose?\u201dAiden\u2019s face hardened.\u201cVerndia!\u201dLia, who had called him by his first name, glared at him. After staring at the man surnamed Hillace, she turned his back and walked away. As he stretched out his arm, the crow landed softly.\u201cFind her. Find her by all means.\u201dCrow was Croa and her twin brother. To Suin, twins meant sharing a soul. Even if one of them was in another part of the end of this world, the other one will be able to find him. Why couldn\u2019t they find Psychke in the same empire? Sending Crow flying, he clenched his fists. The engagement ring on his left ring finger rested on the palm of his hand.Why, why can\u2019t I locate her?This was the first time ever.She seems to be somewhere, but he couldn\u2019t figure out where she was. This was more worst than before when he couldn\u2019t feel anything, but the burning inside was still there.\u2018\u2026 Tension?\u2019Feeling unfamiliar, he looked down at his hand. Even when he crossed the threshold of death surrounded by hundreds of monsters, his strong hands were shaking.Why, why?!!(TN: Heh, Verndia is all impatient. Go on find your womaaan!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018.. D*mn it.\u2019He felt so thirsty. It was a terrible thirst that could not be quenched with a mere lot amount of water as the sea. What would happen if she didn\u2019t show up? Just the mere thought of that caused turmoil in his heart. It was a feeling that he had never felt before. Verndia with his bowed head covered his face with both of his hands.Where did this thirst come from? How to vanquish it? He doesn\u2019t know. It was terrible. He just longed for something for the first time in his life. He hoped and hoped like he had never hoped in his entire life.He wanted to see her,He wanted to see that she was alive and well with his two eyes. No, he only wanted to see her but to ow where she could be\u2026At that very moment,\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe ring resonated.Verndia turned behind him. He looked at the tent where the giant dolls had protruded. There was Psychke Silkisia, there she is. He ran toward her like a crazy man. The crow was flying in front of him, perhaps feeling the other half of his soul. He pulled back the tent that had become rags. He saw that the floor where there was nothing swelled up as if it was going to explode.It was where Aiden claimed that there was a magic circle. Verndia drew his sword. The easiest way to destroy a magic circle is to destroy it. Even though all you can see was black, if he cut it down, wouldn\u2019t it react to something? He thought so.He wasn\u2019t like the cold-blooded man he usually was, not taking the slightest consideration into the reaction this thing would have. But before he even swung the sword once. The floor exploded.Dirt poured out of the air like a fountain. A crow popped out of the dirt. It was Croa. The crow, whose vision was blocked by the dirt, collided with the brother who was flying so hard that it sounded like a thud.\u2013 Kaaaaw!\u2013 Kaaaaw!\u201cCough!\u201dThe crows that had fallen, tangled together, quacked. However, Verndia did not pay attention to them. He heard the voice of the princess, but why can\u2019t he see her? He desperately groped the ring in his finger, she was definitely here. But why can\u2019t she be seen? And why was the princess\u2019s voice so small that it seemed like it could be heard from far away?\u201cCough!\u201dThere was a small, harsh cough, as if vomiting dirt. Verndia reflexively looked back in the direction of the sound.[Move!][You get out of the way!]It was a point not far from where the crows were fighting. An unbelievable sight unfolded before his eyes. He froze for a moment.\u201c\u2026 Princess?\u201d\u201cCough, cough!\u201dPsychke\u2019s appearance after rolling on the floor was a mess. Her body was covered in dirt and dust. She has wounds that still bled. Yes, that was what he was expecting of her appearance. He expected that she might be hurt here and there. Because she always goes out and gets hurt. Because she didn\u2019t follow him today.She might be, she thought.However,\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026 is she small as a bean?\u201dHe had never even dreamed that a situation where Psychke in this small figure will happen.***\u201cIt\u2019s a taboo to invite Silkisia to the North.\u201dWas he six or seven? It was the day he went down to the capital in his carriage to meet Silkisia. Young Verndia nodded his head. He knew that too, that Silkisia had never been to the North except in its earliest days.\u201cIs it because here is too far away?\u201d\u201cRather than that-\u201dHis mother looked out of the window. It was still a northern territory, so the whole territory was covered with snow.\u201cThe only thing the South doesn\u2019t have is always in the North.\u201d\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\u201cYou will know when the time is right.\u201dLittle Verndia didn\u2019t know why. It was the same even when he became an adult.\u2018Did I fall asleep?\u2019Bright light seeped in through the open curtains. Verndia, who had been sleeping uncomfortably on the sofa with one arm covering his eyes, stood up. The report resting on his chest fell onto his thigh. It was something he watched even before going to sleep. He squeezed his tired eyes.No matter how much time you split, there was a limit to what the capital could handle. As for the monsters, he had to return to the north as soon as possible.It should be\u2026..\u2018It\u2019s okay to stay a little longer.\u2019Verndia had no intention of staying in the capital for this long. The reason why he came to the capital in the first place was that Lia had called him in saying that he had discovered \u2018Traces of the use of forbidden magic\u2019.The prince\u2019s banquet?That sort of thing. He originally intended to return after having Isolet present as an agent. It may cause the emperor\u2019s anger, but it\u2019s not a big deal to be hated. It was enough if the situation became difficult because they did not send imperial knights.But\u2026\u2018Shall we stay until the banquet?\u2019After Psychke sent Lia\u2019s magic formula, things got a lot better in the North. People are no longer helpless, and he has heard of some victories in small battles. So, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to stay in the capital until the prince\u2019s coming-of-age banquet is over?\u2018It\u2019s going to be hard to see after that anyway.\u2019Silkisia cannot go to the North. Honestly, he wanted to take her. Whether it\u2019s using swordsmanship as an excuse or breaking up engagements. He wanted to take her no matter what excuse he had to say. The moment he saw Psychke, who appeared after a few hours, he realized his feelings.He couldn\u2019t believe it even after realizing it, so he pondered and questioned himself over and over again. However, no matter how much he thought about it, there was only one conclusion.\u2018Since when did this happen?\u2019Small laughter came out. He never could have imagined that he would feel this way for someone. He wondered how he had become such a blunt person. However, he had no regrets. He was honest with his feelings. He wouldn\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t realize it, but he didn\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t know.(TN: Maaan, the wait is over!! Guys, Verndia finally realized his feelings. Celebration!!! Psychke, now, when?)Hence, he decided to move as his heart led him.\u2018I missed you.\u2019(TN: Aacckk!! M-my heart! Wa-wait\u2026. Ahhhh\u2026)It\u2019s been hours since he hasn\u2019t seen her. He wanted to see Psychke. As soon as he felt that he wanted to see her, he checked her location with his ring.\u2018Is she in her room?\u2019Even today, the princess was well in his mansion. It was one of the things that got better after her body got smaller. That she would never go out alone anymore. After checking where she was, he picked up the fallen report. He wanted to finish these things quickly and go see her. But nothing caught his attention.\u2018Is there no other than these?\u2019His mind was filled with princesses wearing cute doll dresses. There were no clothes that fit, so Cecil put the doll\u2019s clothes in the storage room in a hurry. Unexpectedly, it fit so well and looked so cute, so there was an uproar.\u2018I don\u2019t want this\u2026.\u2019She really didn\u2019t like them, so he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u2018Ah, what should I do?\u2019Unknowingly, he laughed out loud. She is so cute he was going crazy. What should he do? He don\u2019t think he can go back to the North alone.(TN: Psychke\u2019s cuteness attack overload!! Pew, pew, pew!)\u2018Should I just kidnap her?\u2019Verndia, who was giggling, eventually tumbled to the floor. Then he stood up with a smile on his face. Isolet\u2019s eyes widened as he quietly opened the door and came in, staring at his who looked like a madman.(TN: Isolet, hush, you know that love makes him crazy. Ahaha.)***[For the Princess one.]Tak.[For Myself one.]Tak.[For the Princess one.]Tak.[For Myself one.]Tak.The chocolate cookie tops piled up according to a certain beat.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can stop.\u201dPsychke dissuaded the cookie tower from collapsing. She was eating a piece of cookie that Croa splits.[Why are you eating so slowly? It tastes awful?]\u201cNo, it is delicious. I just eat slow.\u201dAfter her body got smaller, she could only do basic training, so her activity level decreased. It seemed that she ate more and Croa she took care of her and there. Croa in the form of a crow tilted his head to the side. The wind blew and the bracelet on the top of her head glittered.It was an ornament that Psyche had brought from Silkisia. The crow stretched out his wings and put her bracelet back on so it wouldn\u2019t fall off.[Princess, when will you grow up again?]\u201cI am not sure.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t even figure out why she was so small. Although she said that Lia and the Duke would help her.\u2018I don\u2019t think this is too bad.\u2019Is it a joke or serious?Verndia\u2019s harsh words came to her mind. Psychke let out a light sigh.[Hehehe. You are shorter than me.]Croa stabbed her with his words, as if it was strange to be a person smaller than crow. Psychke sneezed at her a few times as her feathers rolled around in front of her nose.[Do you want to ride on my back? Do you want to leave?]\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dAfter being nearly run over by the servants a few times while wandering around her hall, Croa kept trying to give her a lift. Even when she escaped from the maze, it was difficult because of her motion sickness, so further flying was not recommended. She was also afraid that she would fall.[Mmm. Then what are you playing with?]Something came to her mind when he asked what she was playing with.\u201cCroa.\u201dPsychke, who was drinking tea, put down a small teacup. She quietly stared at the crow. She then forgot about it and couldn\u2019t tell him. She seemed to have something to say.[Yes?]\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t think you listened to what I said in the maze.\u201d[What did I say?]As if he really couldn\u2019t remember, Croa tilted his head while holding the bracelet on his head.\u201cI mean, don\u2019t go anywhere, and ask me to play with you. This is a secret though\u2026\u201dBefore receiving a Suin\u2019s blessing, all of Crow and Croa\u2019s words sounded like cackling. So, even if she tell Croa the secret, it will not enter anyone else\u2019s ears. Psychke lowered her voice so that the words would not leak out of the room.\u201cSooner or later, the duke and I will break off our engagement.\u201d[What is a breakup?]\u201cTo cancel an engagement?\u201d[Oh, I know that. Why is that?]\u201c\u2026. What?\u201d[Can you play with me even if you cancel your engagement?]Croa blinked his innocent eyes. Psychke was perplexed.\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be with the Duke?\u201d[Yes. I need to be with father. But why is that? The princess is also with father.]\u201c\u2026. If he cancels our engagement, I won\u2019t be here anymore.\u201d[\u2026] !]Croa was surprised and froze. She didn\u2019t have the confidence to look at those wide crimson eyes. Psychke lowered her eyes.\u201cSorry.\u201dCroa stared at her as if he wanted to deny the reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t even care that the bracelet on his head was rolling on the floor.\u2013 Kaaaaaaaagh!Psychke felt so sorry because there was nothing any more to say. She stared in vain at the black feathers which fluttered in the air.[Kaak! Kaak! You cheated on me! You cheater! You bastard! Aren\u2019t you coming right away? Hey! Hey!]She thought he was simply talking to himself out of anger. Surprisingly, after a while, a yellow-eyed crow came in through the open window.[Uh, cookies.]The fluttering crow was nowhere to be seen. As soon as Crow appeared, he charged towards the chocolate cookies stacked like a tower. Croa, who was angry to the end of his head, hit him with his torso.\u2013 Kaack!Two black lumps tangled in the air fell and to the floor.[What are you doing without manners?][Manner? What manner? Hey! The princess is breaking off her marriage with father!][Uh? What is that?][What? What is that you\u2019re talking about? What do you mean what\u2014]The venomous Croa pulled out the feathers of the Crow\u2019s wing with its beak. At first, Croa, who was only defending himself, began to counterattack as if he was getting angry. Unknown black feathers fluttered in the air.[You heard that My Lord is canceling the engagement?!][I didn\u2019t know they were breaking up!][That\u2019s the sound, stupid!][No way!]\u201c\u2026Hey, guys?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know why they were fighting but she just wants to stop them. It would be miracle if she wouldn\u2019t be hurt by their beak with her small as bean body.\u201cStop it\u2026\u201dPsychke stopped the two crows from fighting. Not even his seeds were eaten.[You! Why! That was a lie!][What am I?!][That you can\u2019t see the princess once father cancels the engagement! The Princess! Here! You can\u2019t!][What?]Surprised, the other Crow stopped moving. Taking advantage of that gap, Croa climbed on top of him.[Bad guy! Bad guy! Why are you lying, you bitch-]Kwang!\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe door opened violently. Croa stopped moving at the cold voice dripping in the cold air. It had a bunch of black feathers in its beak.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe voice asked again.Footsteps.The sound of footsteps was ferocious, as if reflecting an angry mind. Croa, who hurriedly came down from the top of the Crow, prostrated himself at the appearance of a reaper from hell.\u201cI know you did something wrong.\u201dVerndia glared at the two trembling crows. Both were very ugly with their feather\u2019s half-plucked. He hadn\u2019t originally intended to come in like this. But the princess\u2019s room was so noisy that it could be heard from outside his mansion. The bracelet that Croa dropped was caught on the shoe that crossed her room. He frowned as he recognized at a glance that it belonged to the princess.\u201cIs it not enough to make a fuss and even steal?\u201d\u201cI gave it to him.\u201dPsychke hastily intervened. She was sorry because it seemed she was the reason why the two crows fought, but she also couldn\u2019t let them get scolded for a misunderstanding.\u201cI promised to give it to you at the maze.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Clear the mess up and get out.\u201dSwipe, swipe.Looking at him, the two crows diligently began to tidy up the place. They collected the scattered black feathers and swept them away. Then Croa, whose volume was reduced by half, muttered in a sullen voice.[Dad, no brother, no lord, if you break off the marriage, the princess can\u2019t be here anymore?]\u201cHmm?\u201d[There\u2019s no more Princess\u2026]Verndia stared blankly at Psychke. He raised one eyebrow and let out a suspicious voice.\u201cI remember saying that I would break off the engagement, but I don\u2019t remember saying that I would kick her out?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t seem to know that if we break up, I have to leave-\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s like that? That if we break up, you\u2019ll leave?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Pardon?\u201d\u201cI think I said it. But it would be frustrating if I can\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy, are you going somewhere after our breakup?\u201dVerndia, who laughed lightly, crouched down to make eye contact with her.\u201cWhere will you go though?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t say anything to his purple eyes which seemed burning and was about to swallow her. In fact, she hadn\u2019t even decided on her destination, but even if she had, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell.\u201cTell me. Yes?\u201dHe said, \u2018Tell me\u2019, but why does it feel, \u2018I\u2019ll burn it\u2019? Her face became hot. Psychke averted her eyes. Stuttering with sudden shift of emotions, she barely blurted,\u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you saying you\u2019re not going?\u201d\u201cAfter breaking off the marriage\u2026. I think it would be a little weird to stay\u2026\u201d[Then you don\u2019t have to break off the engagement, Princess!]\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dPsychke was momentarily taken aback and was speechless. And Verndia, looking at her like that, saw a certain hope in her.\u201cHmm.\u201dIn the past, he would have said he would break up the marriage right away, but her reaction was different. He thinks he might have to tweak it a bit better. He has already used swordsmanship as an excuse, so what should he do\u2026 Wait.\u201cAre you sure you talked to Croa just now?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Because Croa gave the Suin\u2019s blessing. He didn\u2019t say it because he said he would say it to you\u2026\u2026\u201dShe likes to change to topic, so she explained herself in a hurry. Psychke\u2019s voice faded. It was because Verndia was glaring at Croa with his murderous eyes.[Hihihi!]She forgot what to say as Croa threw away everything he was cleaning and ran away through her window. Even so, he couldn\u2019t get far and was summoned by Verndia.***\u201cHa, Croa\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the sound of his deep breathing, Croa, who was standing upright with both wings, trembled. Verndia touched his forehead.His back hurt. (TN: Come on, I will massage it for you, ehehe.)If he does something like that, shouldn\u2019t he report it in a hurry? He realized why Psychke had become smaller.\u201cThe powers of the two gods collided within her body. Because the god that Suins worship is not Vicente. It must have collided with Vicente\u2019s superpower.\u201dHe thinks he has said several times that hi body isn\u2019t like this. He didn\u2019t listen this time either, so Psychke decided to go along with his words.\u201cI heard that the duke also received it. Did the duke get smaller too?\u201d\u201cYou said everything. I didn\u2019t get smaller, and my gender was\u2026 tsk.\u201dHe frowned and sighed.\u201cYou know, it hurts. Anyway, I guess I\u2019ll have to go to the High Priestess to solve it completely. I hear you\u2019re a bit busy these days.\u201dVerndia said that he would put a message in the temple, and that it would be better to repair the artifact he used before and use it temporarily until he heard from her.\u201cLet\u2019s ask Lia. By the way, I heard that the servants almost stepped on the Princess.\u201dVerndia pushed his forehead playfully. She did as he said. Wandering around alone in her tiny body, she was almost stepped on several times by his employees who didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t see her.\u201cI can\u2019t even see her well because she is small as rat. Why is she walking around like that?\u201d\u201cRat\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I understand. It\u2019s frustrating to stay in her room because of her body now. So, I\u2019ve been thinking about how to solve this situation.\u201dFor some reason, Verndia laughed mischievously.\u201cFirst, she always hangs out with someone. Whether it\u2019s me or that crow\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You are uncomfortable because of me.\u201d\u201cI am not uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cHmm. Then there must a second way.\u201dUnexpectedly, Verndia moved over without pushing her opinion, even though he felt sorry for her. In a way, she seemed to be enjoying herself.\u2018What is the second way?\u2019Why did he look like that? Psychke only found out after a few days. It was the beginning of the ordeal.* * *\u201cI do not like it.\u201dSeeing what Cecil had brought, Psychke shook her head. The trembling of her body was a sign of her disgust.\u201cBut Princess\u2026\u201dHer words were apologetic, but her expression didn\u2019t. Her eyes twinkled like a beast preying on her prey.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to be rattled than stepped on?\u201dJingle.The little bell she was holding made a clear sound. Psychke backed away abruptly, like a man who had seen something he couldn\u2019t see.\u201cI do not like it!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just avoid them.\u201dPsychke said without breathing.\u201cI absolutely hate it.\u201dThe second method the duke said was like this! The first would have been better. It\u2019s not even a cat, what the hell is that?\u2018I will never wear that.\u2019However, the idea disappeared after only a few days.\u201cOoohh\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt was through the hallway. It was good to avoid the lady-in-waiting who came with her laundry so tall that she couldn\u2019t see her. However, the lady-in-waiting tripped and fell. She was fortunate enough not to get caught on her body, but her laundry washed over her.\u201cThere are people here!\u201dHer thick laundry ate away her cries. Psychke was carried to the laundry along with the laundry the lady-in-waiting was carrying, and barely managed to get out after tearing the laundry with her sword just before falling into the water.\u201cForgive me!\u201dHer maid, who became her contemplative, bowed her head.\u201cNo.\u201dShe felt sorry for tearing the laundry that shouldn\u2019t have been torn, so Psychke apologized as well.But, it didn\u2019t end there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, some cases would not have happened if employees would have be very careful.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like bells, there\u2019s also a shiny and beeping headband. If you put this on, everyone know the princess\u2019s location anywhere!\u201d\u201cThat is unusual, but I\u2019ll remember that.\u201dIn the end, Psychke, who was not even a cat, ended up putting a bell around her neck. It was a magic bell specially designed so that the person wearing it will not hear the sound of the bell in consideration of ear health. The jingles of the bell on her neck have a good success. Now every employees shunned her. Psychke was depressed because their eyes looking at her were always smiling.And her depression reached its peak because of Verndia, who made her heart stagger, stumbled and disappeared. But this wasn\u2019t the end of her ordeal.\u201cA portrait? Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rare, so we should commemorate it.\u201dYes, she was unusual.She wonders if anyone else can go through something like this besides her body had to become smaller with the power of God.However,\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any need to celebrate.\u201d\u201cWhen your body comes back, I\u2019ll pass on additional swordsmanship.\u201d.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThere was no benefit to outsiders knowing that her body had become smaller, so the person with the most dexterity among the employees was selected. As she grew smaller, her image with her bells on remained forever on a small canvas. And the completed portrait ended up on the desk in Verndia\u2019s office.(TN: My gawd, Verndia is so whipped for her AHAHA.)\u201cWh, why is it there!\u201d\u201cTo see and laugh when I\u2019m depressed.\u201dHe may be able to laugh, but Psychke has become more depressed. As the weekend came to an end, her disgraceful days continued,\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201dStella came to visit her.***It was Lestir\u2019s living room.Stella, placing the teacup on her pedestal, opened her mouth.\u201cThanks to you, the children are all well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u201dShe was sitting on top of a high pile of books, but her eyes were not aligned because she was shorter than Stella, who was sitting on the sofa. Psychke nodded her head out of sight, then shrank her head, waiting for her bell to jingle. Thankfully, Stella only glanced at the bell, but her expression did not change. After exchanging simple greetings, they talked about a few more things about the Doll Kingdom incident. Just when it seemed like everything was sorted out, Psychke changed the subject.\u201cMiss Stella, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201dPsychke squeezed the warmed peppermint teacup with both of her hands.\u201cI heard that Miss Stealla, as \u2018Mercenary Delas\u2019, dealt with Asum, a mage-type monster.\u201d\u201cOh my, how did you?\u201dStella\u2019s eyes narrowed. She seemed to be smiling just by looking at her eyes, but she didn\u2019t feel like she was laughing at all.\u201cI changed my appearance.\u201dThinking that there was no need to sell Aiden\u2019s name, Psychke didn\u2019t answer. Stella didn\u2019t expect an answer either, so she continued.\u201cShe just accidentally disposed of it in passing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but there is Asum in the Northern Lestir Territory.\u201d\u201cYes. Some said the same to me.\u201d\u201cCan you help me?\u201dAsum was only able to catch women, as the nickname pervert demon. Most of Lestir\u2019s soldiers are men, and most of his hired mercenaries are men. A few women refused because they felt pressured to risk their lives to break through higher-level magic. So, Stella was the only qualified person. As long as her feet touch the ground, she will not be hurt. Psychke would be fine.\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t mean just asking for help. If there is anything you want, I will listen to it, the duke asked me to deliver it to you. Same for me too.\u201d\u201cThat is what am I to you?\u201dWith a pretty smile, Stella tilted her face slightly to the side. Can she dare blurt that out?\u201cHow dare you say something like that.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dNo matter how much she looked back, she couldn\u2019t understand what she was trying to say.Psychke stared at the woman, dressed in a Western nomadic style, with her hair wrapped up and only her face exposed. Stella put it simply.\u201cThat\u2019s an undeserved offer.\u201d\u201cThen-\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t think I can help.\u201dA stubbornness flickered in her brown eyes. Psychke noticed that no matter what she said, the other person\u2019s mind wouldn\u2019t change, but she didn\u2019t back down either.\u201cI am not asking for help right now. After rescuing the children-\u201d\u201cThere was a kid who loved dolls.\u201dThere was deep longing in Stella\u2019s expression and tone.\u201cI thought you would come to the venue, but you didn\u2019t. So, I went to visit you in person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want him to go back to the desert with me, but he\u2019s stubborn and greedy, so I think it\u2019ll take some time to persuade that kid.\u201dPsychke shut her mouth at the feeling of longing that grew thicker the more Stella spoke.\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t do your request. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt came out like that, but she couldn\u2019t say anything more, so she lowered her eyes. After that, she couldn\u2019t remember what they were talking about. She knows it was not polite, but she lost focus on the other person because she thinks she might have to use \u2018That Way\u2019 to deal with Asum. At that time, when she was lost in the sea of her wanderings, her familiar sentence brought her back to her reality.\u201cThen, Pailas Astania.\u201dPsyche raised her head. Her jingle, the sound of bells that she couldn\u2019t hear, was cheerful.\u201cMiss Stella, can I ask you one more question?\u201d\u201cAs much as you like.\u201d\u201cWhat does \u2018Pailas Astania\u2019 mean? Maybe \u2018May your breath dwell in the stars in the night sky\u2019?\u201dStella made a surprised face.\u201cTo be literal, yes, that\u2019s right. How did you know that? It was an archaic word that very few people in the West know!\u201dPsychke was also surprised by that statement. Why is the gore of the West being used as the code for an illegal auction house? Westerners hated auctions. It was for the reason that it would encourage competition for nothing, rather than simply setting a price. But why is the old language of such a place being used as a code for an illegal auction house? Psychke looked straight up into Stella\u2019s eyes.\u201cI went to an illegal auction house for work, and the password there was \u2018Pailas Astania\u2019.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dStella\u2019s brown eyes widened.What was she thinking? Stella looked down at Psychke in surprise, but she was silent. A small silence fell in the living room. The one who broke the silence was Verndia, who opened the door and entered.\u201cWhat is it? It\u2019s lunchtime, and you haven\u2019t gone yet?\u201dThe serious atmosphere disappeared in an instant. Seeing him, Stella smiled, her eyes twinkling in amusement.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Lestir.\u201d\u201cYes. Long time no see.\u201dHe replied casually, and carefully lifted Psychke with both hands, saying that they should go to eat now. Stella, who had been watching them quietly, began to rhyme with a strange tone.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you take care of someone like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s natural, since we\u2019re engaged, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s not a good phenomenon.\u201dStella muttered to herself meaningfully. Then, with an apologetic expression, she left an incomprehensible message to the man who turned away, to be exact, to Psyche who was in the palm of Verndia.(TN: Ugh, my heart!! Psychke is so cute if she was sitting on Verndia\u2019s palm! So cuutte!)\u201cI\u2019ve heard a good story, so I guess I have to pay the price. Evergreen likes perfume. I hope this helps.\u201dIn an instant, Psychke clearly saw Verndia\u2019s face hardened. Verndia remained silent for a long time after that, and it was only when she reached the entrance of the dining room that she murmured curtly.\u201cI like perfume too.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHe said nothing more.They had just finished lunch and was about to eat dessert. Verndia, who had been contemplating something with a melancholy expression throughout his meal, took her luck away.\u201cPrincess.\u201dHe cut the cake to the size of a fingernail and placed it on Psychke\u2019s doll\u2019s plate at the table.\u201cWidnix is a madman.\u201dPsychke blinked slowly. It was surprising that a man with the nickname of a mad dog describes someone as a madman, even though the target was the Duke of Widnix Evergreen, the owner of \u2018The Wind That Doesn\u2019t Blow\u2019. When she didn\u2019t respond, the man, who assumed she didn\u2019t believe him, insisted again.\u201cEveryone is fooled by the fact that he has a pretty face, but his actual personality is very dirty.\u201dHer eyelids blinked a little faster at the sudden self-introduction of someone.Even though he himself thought it was something he didn\u2019t want to say, Verndia crumpled his brow.He shifted the subject,\u201cI won\u2019t forget what I promised.\u201d\u201cPromise?\u201d\u201cI mean not having another woman during our engagement.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShe didn\u2019t know why he suddenly said that but she only nodded her head in a slow manner.Even so, Verndia\u2019s face still did not straighten.\u201cThen why is your taste Widnix\u2026 why do you want to go to the East after breaking up our marriage? No, the East is the only option.\u201dHis mind was spinning as if he were dealing with silence. After leaving the capital, Psychke could not go to the southern part of Silkisia\u2019s home base, and the northern part was automatically excluded from those options.All that was left was the east and west, but the west, which was made up of endless sand, had a different culture and was not welcoming to outsiders.\u2018So, the only place to go is the eastern part, and for that, he must be friendly with Widnix in advance.\u2019Yeah, when he think about it, it was natural.Theoretically, it was more appropriate to decide at leisure now than to urgently decide on a destination after breaking up their marriage. But he felt so dirty about that Duke.You f**king Widnix b*stard.Meanwhile, Psyckhe, not knowing what Verndia was thinking, was just curious.\u2018Why is he acting like that?\u2019Through the ring, she could sense that Verndia was displeased. Did he even work with the Duke of Evergreen before?\u201cNo, I never thought about it.\u201dWith that single word, the feeling that seemed like it would never go away from his heart no matter what I did melted away in an instant. However, Verndia didn\u2019t show off on the outside and asked, pretending to be annoyed.\u201cThen why did you ask about Widnix\u2019s taste?\u201d\u201cI never asked.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Stella said something without you asking.\u201dEven so, Verndia believed in Psychke. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person to lie.\u2018Then why did you say that?\u2019At that time, even if it was the sound of catching a floating cloud, later on, he looked back at Stella, a woman who made a sound with bones. The fact that she informed Widnix\u2019s taste seems to mean that the princess should get his favor as soon as possible.Why?\u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe me, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dShe was just telling the truth, but she couldn\u2019t help it if he didn\u2019t believe her. Instead of persuading him, Psychke looked at the cake on her plate.Her favorite was Chef Lestir\u2019s special strawberry cake. Unfortunately, there were no strawberries in small pieces. She tried to taste it with a small fork, but a large strawberry came down and crushed the cake.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019Psychke looked up at him with darkened eyes. The man who killed the strawberry cake was laughing loudly and merrily.\u201cEat a lot.\u201d\u201cWhen will Cecil\u2019s finger be alright?\u201dWhy was Verndia personally serving her meals? It was simple, it was because Cecil\u2019s finger was broken.Clearly, she was fine until the food service came out, but Cecil asked for a moment and disappeared, leaving white bandages wrapped around her fingers. Naturally, the butler lowered his head.\u2018I\u2019m sorry this happened. I will change the attendants until Cecil recovers.\u2019\u2018Ho, ho, ho, what are you talking about, butler? I can\u2019t hold a knife, but I can do everything else!\u2019\u2018Then, we\u2019ll assign additional people to serve food. Pia?\u2019\u2018Oh, I suddenly got an upset stomach!\u2019\u2018Rona?\u2019\u2018Ugh. I don\u2019t have strength in my arms!\u2019\u2018Hmm? What\u2019s wrong with everyone? I\u2019m not good at cutting, but if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll\u2013 wh, what is it?\u2019Everyone in the mansion became weak, unable to even hold a knife.So, it was decided that Verndia would cut the food for Psychke, who had grown smaller in size. It was a bonus that she was with him at every meal.\u201cSomeday she will recover. Why don\u2019t you eat it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too big for me to eat.\u201d\u201cYou can cut it and eat it.\u201dPsychke\u2019s gaze fell upon the messy surroundings and the mottled dress. It was a trace of an unintentional fight over food because Verndia only gave her large chunks.\u201cCould you cut it into small pieces? If that bothers you, it\u2019s okay to change the person in charge of serving.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bother.\u201dAs if disapproving of her suggestion, Verndia picked the strawberries carefully.\u201cCan you eat this?\u201dShe think she had said the same dozens of times that her food intake has decreased accordingly since her body became like this, but he don\u2019t listen. Psychke stared blankly at him, and Verndia cut the strawberries with an unwilling expression. Even that was so big that she couldn\u2019t avoid getting strawberry dye on her clothes and cheeks. (TN: Come on, Verndia, wipe her cheeeeeksss!!!)Finally, it was when Psychke was chewing on a small piece of strawberry. A white handkerchief fluttered and covered her stomach. A rough but cautious hand followed soon after.\u201cWhy do you eat while being buried like this, our little Princess?\u201d(TN: Ack, ack, acckk!! MY heatttuuu!!! Verndia and Psychke is sailing!)Verndia started wiping away the dirt on her as if he was handling something precious to him. Even if it was okay to take a bath and change clothes, or not to brush up because it was fine, he always said this at the end of a meal.She was ashamed.Her heart tickled strangely, as if tickled with feathers. In order not to make even the sound of the bell, Psychke held onto the bell and lowered her eyes slightly. Then, by chance, she saw him smiling.\u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201dVerndia self-talked, but it came through her ears with her strengthened five senses.Her mind flashed.She recalled the man\u2019s hobby of \u2018Collecting things that girls like whenever he\u2019s bored\u2019. He recalled that the dress she was wearing, the tea utensils she was using, and her bed also came from his warehouse.\u2018His taste\u2026\u2019She doesn\u2019t think it really suits him, but those intense purple eyes really bothered her. So was the pounding that was transmitted through her ring.\u2018Let\u2019s respect his taste though.\u2019(TN: Puhaha, poor Verndia.)Psychke, who had made such a resolution, asked a question while sneaking away from him.\u201cWouldn\u2019t there be any news from Lia?\u201dLia has been very busy lately. On the day of the Doll Kingdom incident, she was chosen as an advisor because she was a wizard at the scene. Although she did visit after the fact case was closed, she was tricked by Verndia to get any more information from associates than from outsiders.It was because of Psychke\u2019s words that this incident seemed to be related to forbidden magic. Verndia nodded his head.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe case was quickly being settled. Near the venue, magicians with the same wavelength as the growth magic on the dolls were found passed out. The tail of the aristocrat presumed to have instigated them was also caught.If nothing else happens, it will end like this. However, upon hearing the answer, Psychke\u2019s face darkened. In the first place, she did not ask about the circumstances of the case.\u2018You\u2019re very busy. So, when will the artifact be completed?\u2019An artifact that Verndia has entrusted with repairing, temporarily returning her body to its original state.It should be fine soon.Stella\u2019s failed recruitment, Lillian\u2019s fake necklace, etc., were piled up like a mountain of things to be solved right away, and she was nervous.\u2018Oh, come to think of it.\u2019\u201cStella said it was difficult to help. I think she will have to find another way.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dSaying that this was expected, Verndia calmly rubbed Psychke\u2019s cheek with his handkerchief.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have helped if it hadn\u2019t been personal. But why can\u2019t this be erased like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just red. Stop rubbing.\u201dPsychke held Verndia\u2019s fingers so that he wouldn\u2019t rub them anymore. It was hot from the moment he took out the handkerchief, but it was like a stove because of the frictional heat.\u201cWhy are you helping me? Aren\u2019t we on bad terms?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of the unwritten rule among talented people. The don\u2019t interfere in each other\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dThere aren\u2019t many talented people, and there are only three in the empire, so shouldn\u2019t they help each other and live on? Reading Psychke\u2019s expression, Verndia smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s because of the first family heads. The legend about this ring.\u201dVerndia raised his left hand and showed it. The gold ring on his ring finger shone softly.\u201cIt is said that it was made by Lestir, the first person who lost his lover due to a momentary mistake. There is no surviving record, but it is said that the lover was the first Silkisia.\u201dIt was certainly a convincing hypothesis.The first Silkisia and Lestir were on good terms.It is said that the reason why the biggest jewel in Lestir\u2019s sword was sapphire was because of Silkisia.However, they both married different people. And-\u201cThey both went mad and died miserably. It was said that their soul has been torn to pieces.\u201dPsychke\u2019s was shocked and widened her eyes.The history books did not provide details about the end of the first family heads. Just soldiered on died during the war. It was only presented briefly in the same way.\u201cUnlike Evergreen or Stella, where talented people appear every generation, Silkisia and Lestir skip several generations.\u201dAfter carefully brushing Psychke\u2019s hair, Verndia folded his handkerchief.\u201cThey said that was the reason. If it hadn\u2019t been for the feeling of being more than a comrade, they wouldn\u2019t have died that way. So, an unwritten rule arose. Unless the empire is in crisis, let\u2019s not interfere with each other.\u201dIt seems like a very serious story, but Verndia was laughing very happily and loudly.\u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t believe it. I think it was just a coincidence.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They each have their own values.\u201dPsychke didn\u2019t know what to say since she wasn\u2019t the person involved.\u201cAh, that doesn\u2019t mean you should be friends with Widnix. You know?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhy is he being so persistent when she has no reason or opportunity to meet the Duke of Evergreen? It was around the time that Psychke agreed with a shudder at the forceful gaze from him.\u201cA reply came from the temple. And, the person sent by Miss Lia came to visit.\u201dThe butler who visited the dining room announced the arrival of the letter and the visit of the guest.* * *The temple has contacted him to visit with Psychke as soon as possible. So, he was going to go right now, but he put it off because it was Lia\u2019s guest. As soon as he saw the man sitting in the drawing room, Verndia was annoyed.\u201cHa, why did you come again-\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a reaction the man had experienced once or twice, so he didn\u2019t care and stood up and bowed.\u201cHow are you, Duke?\u201d\u201cI was fine until you came here. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dBecause Cecil, who was passing by, saw Psychke almost fighting over the food and took her away in a fright, only Verndia was present in the living room now.He crossed his legs and crossed his arms as if he was displeased with the situation.He didn\u2019t even give instructions to bring tea, so he seemed very willing to drive Psychke out before this man came. Opposite him, Aiden lowered his eyes. Golden eyelashes cast a deep shade under the eyes.\u201cI have something to tell the Duke.\u201dAiden took out a brooch-shaped artifact and a letter from his bosom, which he gave to Psychke and left to be repaired by Lia, and the letter-\u2018Is this related to Keitan\u2019s necklace?\u2019Verndia, who opened the envelope and quickly checked the contents, touched his temple.\u2018There are people trying to recreate Keitan\u2019s necklace?\u2019\u201cThey are crazy d*mn a*s.\u201dHe muttered a swear word.Even if he don\u2019t, he felt that he was going to die of headaches with the information in the letter, but he also have to deal with this.\u201cTell me what you know.\u201dA purple flame rose from his fingertips and burned the letter. Black ash from the pure white inner paper floated in the air and escaped outside on the wind through the open window.Even then, Aiden didn\u2019t move.\u201cIs there anything else left?\u201d\u201cIs the Princess doing well?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that is your business.\u201dAlthough he had taken Aiden inside, he hadn\u2019t let go of his hostility, so Verndia nodded his head, telling him to stop asking about her. Aiden, not paying attention to him, opened his mouth.\u201cI want to see the princess.\u201d\u201cI think I told you not to approach her.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I broke my word, but I have to tell you-\u201d\u201cAh, that the princess is Miss Leas\u2019s daughter.\u201dAiden\u2019s eyes widened and shook. Aiden was taken aback again.\u201cThat was real. Then, the princess is no, wait a minute. How did you know I was looking into it?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know that, you should get rid of your duke\u2019s position.\u201dVerndia protects Psychke, so he put Crow on her because he didn\u2019t believe Aiden completely. And in the process, he found out that he was investigating Psychke. Aiden touched his face dry as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It was like that. As expected, Princess\u2026 Does the Princess know?\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t even think about telling her that. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t tried.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t in the mood to respond kindly, but he did so reluctantly, fearing that if he didn\u2019t tell Aiden, he would be fooling around with her. But Aiden didn\u2019t seem to understand his words.\u201cWhat do you mean by that? Won\u2019t you let her know? Aren\u2019t you supposed to let her know at all costs? If you knew what happened to her in present-day Silkisia-\u201d(TN: This man is way intervening now, sus Aiden.)\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny when you say that, Hillace.\u201dVerndia laughed openly.Aiden bit his lip, then he opened his mouth to make an excuse. But even the chance was snatched away by Verndia.\u201cYes. I bet you want to say she was young when that happened. So what? It was already 18 years. Was there really nothing you could do for 18 years?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been. It couldn\u2019t have been that way. I don\u2019t know why you suddenly changed your mind, and after 18 years of being silence?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was alive. If only I knew a little bit sooner\u2026\u201d\u201cIf the action would change depending on whether or not the princess survived, it would mean that she already knew that the Leas incident was suspicious.\u201d\u201cI kept my mouth shut for 18 years.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you not to approach her. How dare you wear that dirty Hillace\u2019s surname approaching the princess-\u201dDdukdduk.The harsh criticism was cut short by a gentle knock. The two of them shut their mouths.It was Psychke who came in after that.\u201cI\u2019m late, sorry.\u201dPsychke, who had come with Cecil, bowed her head. But Aiden didn\u2019t even look at her, let alone greet her. Then, without exchanging a few words, he left the mansion as if running away.***After Aiden left, Psychke and Verndia went straight to the temple. They received the artifact from Lia, but she came out in a small state because they thought they should show her current state to the high priest in order to solve the root cause.However, it was a festival period, so the carriage was under control. Needless to say, Psychke was put into Verndia\u2019s coat pocket and moved away.(TN: Aaaghh, cuutttee!!)\u2018It\u2019s frustrating.\u2018She felt frustrated in his pocket where she couldn\u2019t see anything. It was all the more so because the sounds she heard were all in a festive mood.So that no one would notice, Psychke poked her head out. The intrusive bells had been removed when they left the mansion.\u2018Wow-\u2018Indeed, the carriage seemed to be controlled.The whole surrounding was in an uproar.It wasn\u2019t even dark yet, but firecrackers exploded here and there. Bards sang, people ate, drank, and danced. Curiously, commoners and nobles seemed to enjoy it together.Belatedly, Verndia found Psychke from his pocket.\u201cI think I told you not to come out.\u201dEven though he said so, he did not push Psychke inside, who was eagerly looking outside. He decided that there would be no benefit in attracting people\u2019s attention, so he put her in his coat pocket, and it seemed that there was no way she would get noticed since it was so noisy and she was way small.Even if they see her, they\u2019ll think she was a doll. (TN: Ahahaha, cute Psychke on the way!)\u201cAre you that curious?\u201dHe laughed and put his hands in his pockets and made a platform for her feet. Thanks to this, Psychke was able to hang on a little more comfortably.\u201cIf anyone sees you, they\u2019ll think you are new to a festival.\u201d\u201cIt is my first time.\u201dThe bewildered Verndia flinched, and his hand trembled. He stuttered involuntarily.\u201cD-Didn\u2019t you participate in the crown prince\u2019s coming-of-age celebration? Or the welcome party for foreign delegations? At least the emperor\u2019s birthday celebration is held every year.\u201d\u201cI have to.\u201dWhen she was a frog in a well, when she thought that only Silkisia would accept her in their world. Even the family members she sees every day hates her, but she didn\u2019t have the confidence to mix with people she was seeing for the first time in her life.So, she didn\u2019t participate. In the first place, she didn\u2019t go out unless there was something special. When she couldn\u2019t go out, she mainly went to places where there were few people, and places that were lonely.\u201cI don\u2019t like crowded places.\u201dPsychke hid the inside his pocket. However, Verndia guessed through what she had seen and experienced so far. Something hot rose up inside him and he clenched his fists.\u201cWhen your body returns to normal, let\u2019s go on a date after a long time.\u201dPsychke looked up at the sudden request for a date. But because Verndia was looking straight ahead, she couldn\u2019t see what his expression was like.\u201cI don\u2019t mind. But aren\u2019t you busy?\u201dShe heard rumors of discord were getting worse, maybe because people haven\u2019t seen them together since they argued at the alley. Was it because of that?Verndia, not knowing what Psychke was thinking, replied,\u201cI can make enough time for that.\u201d\u201cThen let me know when it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\u201cMaybe, anywhere as long as there are crowd of people?\u201d\u201cYou say you don\u2019t like crowded places?\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s what we need to do to put the rumors of discord to rest.\u201d\u201cAre you bothered?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t mind, Duke.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care either.\u201d\u201cAh, I guess you don\u2019t mind now.\u201dIt was Verndia who stopped at her meaningful words.\u201cNow?\u201dHe sat still, like someone who realized something was wrong with her, then went to a place where no one knew her and took her out of his pocket.(TN: Communication is the key, right. Hehe.)And she met his gaze.\u201cDo I look like someone who cares about reputation or something, Princess?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why are you saying that?\u201d\u201cI know that you performed the art of worldly affairs to be out of the emperor\u2019s sight.\u201dPsychke lowered her eyes slightly.\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you treated me well in public?\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dVerndia let out a gasp at the absurd statement.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be afraid of falling out of His Majesty\u2019s eyes?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cThen why did you think like that?\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t get along well, we\u2019ll use that as an excuse to delay your application.\u201d\u201cNo, so I am the one who will care about that. Yes, it is true that I do care.\u201dVerndia, who let out his rough breath, swept his bangs wildly.\u201cMore than that\u2026 I have to say this with my mouth, d*mn it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, the princess has nothing to be sorry for, ha, that\u2019s right. Let\u2019s just say this happened.\u201dHe paused a little, biting his lip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He clicked his tongue and hastily averted his gaze from her.\u201cAt first, I was curious about you, Princess.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPsychke was startled.Verndia didn\u2019t even think of breathing and continued his words.\u201cI never thought of you as stupid, but why are you acting like a fool? I was curious about you, but\u2014\u201dHe looked into a far distance and frowned at his own words.\u201cI think you\u2019re smart, but you act like an idiot! And because of that, I doubt approaching you, since those factions kept on colliding. But I am wary because they still gain my attention.\u201d(TN: Bruh, just say \u2018I like you!!!\u2019 Verndia, do your mouth better, grr!)\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI am not seeking any apology from you. Haa, oh well, I tried not stepping the boundary\u2014\u201dVerndia met his gaze with hers.\u201cI was worried about how the Princess would react.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cAt this current time, I am even weary, unable to predict your actions. Why are you distancing yourself from others?\u201dIn fact, it was because of Psychke, who always feels depressed.Not to mention, he prevented himself from saying those things because he was concerned she would really put a barrier between them.And at the same time, he felt contradictory because of two conflicted thought; the desire to distance himself, or the desire to embrace his desire.\u201cSo, that was why. I always prepare myself to predict your behavior rather than be surprised by the impossible.\u201dAfter hearing his story, Psychke bowed her head.That was why, he didn\u2019t do anything to look good to the emperor but because he was wary of her, who was said to be stupid. Vigilance is only for those who deserve it.Even though his words weren\u2019t particularly good, his words made his heart thump. Silently, he grumbled.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to have such a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cSorry. But anyone would have thought the same thing.\u201d\u201cThen ask after I said my piece. Why did you do that?\u201dIt was embarrassing, but there was no reason to hide it. Psychke explained her actions at that time. She said that he did that because she was afraid after breaking up with him, she\u2019d be useless.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dHe had expected her answer, but after hearing it, he could only sigh. That made him wonder how much he had put his heart on the line. But, whatever she says, he wanted to comfort her. He wanted to tell her that she has nothing to worry about being abandoned in the future. Perhaps, that was why he said something unlike him.\u201cI\u2019ve never hated you. If I hated the princess, would we have ended like this?\u201dIt was a lie, but it wasn\u2019t a lie. In the past, he hated Psychke, but now no. In the past, his feelings toward the princess were mixed with doubt, curiosity, wariness, and rejection. If he had genuinely hated her, he would have cut her off like Lillian. Even Psychke, who had a dazed look on her face because she knew that, nodded as she felt her heart beating softly.\u201cThat, makes\u2026 sense.\u201d\u201cRight now, I like you more than I hate you-\u201d(TN: Oofff\u2026. *looks around* No worries, Verndia, I got you under covered! *In a salute position*)At the words that sprung out naturally, Verndia bit his tongue immediately. He hastily put Psychke in his pocket and blocked the entrance to prevent her from coming up. Inside his pocket, where only darkness was there, she could only stare at the closed entrance blankly.Just right now, what did I hear?***After quite a while, Verndia opened the entrance. His face still looked the same as usual. He seemed calm with his languid expression. Even more so, he couldn\u2019t bring himself of bringing up the topic they had earlier.While comforting her bizarrely beating heart, Psychke deliberately focused on watching the festival. So, how long has it been? On one side, she saw people standing in line holding a newborn baby. They must have come to receive a blessing from the temple.There was a priest on the white stairs handing a freesia that was said to have grown up using only the holy water. Psychke hid her body in his pocket.\u201cI hope there will be no mischief in the duke\u2019s fate.\u201dAlong with the greeting, a yellow freesia burst in. Suddenly covered in pollen, Psychke sneezed several times. Verndia whispered as he put his hand in his pocket to prevent others from looking at his pocket which was moving on its own.\u201cDid you catch a cold?\u201dIf he puts Freesia inside his pocket and she stands\u2026Psychke felt displeased and gazed intently at Verndia\u2019s fingers. The clamor of the festival had subsided and the sound of sacred hymns had risen. As she realized that they had arrived at the temple, the conversation with Aiden she had seen a few hours ago lingered in her ears. Instead of turning a blind eye to going to the auction house, he promised to go to the temple together, and he tried to keep that promise.\u2018It\u2019s done now.\u2019Aiden shook his head.He confirmed what he wanted to check, so he said he wouldn\u2019t have to go.\u2018What was he trying to check?\u2019Psychke couldn\u2019t bear to ask because the man\u2019s eyes were stained red as if he would cry at any moment.\u2018Did they fight?\u2019Considering that Verndia and Aiden were not on good terms, the two went fast as they could, but they realized they were late because of the conflict. A simple hello and thank you for meeting Stella was the only conversation.\u2018By the way, Duke, please stop.\u2019Verndia was happily playing her hair with his thumb and forefinger, perhaps because he liked how silky her hair is. That was already embarrassing but his warm fingers that kept on brushing with her face makes it even worse.(TN: Ugh, just kiss it already!!)It seemed that he quite adores that she tapped his finger to motion him to stop. He did stop only to continue again. He likes to fiddle with her hair.\u2018It seems like he does this on purpose.\u2019Every time his finger accidentally brushed her face, he will poke her cheek intentionally, which rose up somehow this unique feeling. Psychke wrapped her blushing cheeks tightly so that he couldn\u2019t touch them anymore. (TN: Eyy, stawp!)She was on the verge of running away from his hand when,\u201cThere\u2019s a way to determine one\u2019s ability?\u201d\u201cAh, sister. You really didn\u2019t know?\u201dThe harsh voices in her ears suddenly caught her nerves. The regular movement stopped, as if Verndia became aware of them.\u201cYes, not at all. Why didn\u2019t father tell me about that?\u201d\u201cHe must have forgotten because of that d*mn bitch Psychke.\u201d\u201cRight, lady. Since it has come to this, why don\u2019t you try it now? Sir, didn\u2019t the high priest say he was free earlier?\u201d\u201cHe is free, but it\u2019s difficult to have him here now. There must be at least two witnesses of at least a marquis in the discriminant.\u201dPsychke and Verndia arrived earlier than the planned time with the high priest. So it seemed that it was time for a discriminant ceremony.\u201cInvit\u2014Ah!\u201dWith a slight exclamation, they heard someone approaching them. The sound of the heels ringing low and the sound of the hem of the dress brushing together.Eventually, the other person greeted them cheerfully.\u201cSilisia\u2019s eldest daughter, Lillian Silkisia, is greeting Duke Lestir. Have you been, Duke?\u201d\u201cThe eldest daughter?\u201dVerndia repeated and laughed.\u201cI guess the Princess doesn\u2019t know the meaning of eldest daughter. Are you the eldest?\u201d\u201cAh, the duke doesn\u2019t know yet. Psychke will go to another country sooner or later. Are you here alone?\u201dJust listening to her so-called cute voice drew the attention of others. It became her habit to twist her hair and pretends to be weak every time. Psychke stuck her tongue out.She must have known at least that the Duke was the one who took her after she had run away from home. It was a wonder where such audacity came from. Verndia answered dryly.\u201cAs you see.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what brings you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to play.\u201d\u201cWell, then can I ask for an escort for the day?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a bit.\u201dPerhaps Lillian got too much of herself that she even approached him, which made him step back a little. At the same time, a soft hand reached out to stroke Psychke\u2019s hair inside his pocket. It felt more affectionate than when he was joking with her a moment ago.\u201cI don\u2019t have time to spend on the princess.\u201dLillian became quiet in the embarrassment of rejecting her publicly. But Psychke could only vaguely picture her.She must be trembling with her face flushed red. Although she may be boiling inside, she pretends to be shy on the outside. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t long before she heard a fawning voice. Although she was more downtrodden than before.\u201cWell then, could you join us? I was going to have an ability test, but they said I needed a witness.\u201d\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be too much.\u201dHe agreed without hesitation. It\u2019s Lillian Silkisia\u2019s discriminant. She already knew what the outcome would be, so there was nothing wrong watch. Thinking of the change in Princess Lillian\u2019s expression, he thought it would be fun.\u201cThen we need one more person besides me- um? What\u2019s he doing here?\u201dAs Verndia pondered, he headed for someone and spoke to him sarcastically.\u201cI thought that even if the empire collapsed, you would be stuck in the eastern part, but what happened that you came here to the capital?\u201d\u201cAh. Verndia.\u201dA slow, heartless, impersonal voice replied.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of your authority?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dVerndia was dumbfounded at the sudden answer. Psychke looked up, where the light leaked in solid lines. She was a bit familiar with the voice, but she couldn\u2019t remember the owner so it became an unfamiliar voice for her.\u2018Who is it?\u2019Lillian\u2019s delighted voice immediately revealed who it was.\u201cDuke Evergreen! I\u2019m trying to do an ability discriminant. If you have time, could you join us as a witness?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Widnix softly agreed.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cThank you, Duke!\u201dLillian\u2019s delighted voice disappeared along with the priest\u2019s footsteps. The voices of Lenox and Melissa followed suit.After some time.The two of them, Verndia and Widnix, also moved along with the low-ranking priest who had come to pick up the initiates. Against the background of the regular sound of shoes, Verndia asked as if tossing.\u201cBecause of my authority. What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if I tell you.\u201d\u201cShall I make it useful?\u201dVerndia fired sparks as a threat. Widnix replied quietly.\u201cI was told not to use the authority this time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that? What about this time?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget the promise you made back then that you would never use your authority again.\u201dWidnix closed his mouth at the end of the incomprehensible words. Soon, the two footsteps stopped. They arrived at the place where the ability test would take place.\u201cTsk.\u201dVerndia, who was chewing on Widnix\u2019s words, clicked his tongue. To not use authority this time. Don\u2019t forget the promise he made back then?\u2018He mean I use it again after that?\u2019It was embarrassing, but he couldn\u2019t tell because he didn\u2019t tell him in detail.Shaking off his doubts, he pulled Psychke up from his pocket to the edge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayVerndia didn\u2019t want to show her to Widnix, but he also couldn\u2019t keep her locked inside the mansion. Widnix isn\u2019t the kind of guy who\u2019s going around talking, so it won\u2019t be known anywhere.Psychke finally saw the inside of the temple where the ceremony will take place. A small lake at the end of the white pillars, which supported the ceiling. The lake shone with golden light falling from above.Lillian, the High Priest stood on the center. While Lenox and Melissa were outside, assisting the ceremony. And the rest are her, Verndia and Widnix.Widnix muttered seeing her.\u201cWhy is Princess Psychke here? It wasn\u2019t like this before.\u201dPsychke was unable to hear his words, so she raised her face. But right now, she seemed to be facing light green eyes which looked insensitive and when she came into her senses, Widnix was already looking straight ahead. It was the first time for him to see her this small so he must be surprised, but expectedly, he was emotionless.Widnix pursed his lips.\u201cWhat do you think, Verndia?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThe result of the ceremony.\u201d\u201cDoes my opinion matter?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThen just shut up and watch.\u201dPsychke felt a bit embarrassed. She thought that the Duke was not with Hillace because he called them both crazy, but it looked like it was not the case. Verndia is Verndia, that even to Widnix, he didn\u2019t want to talk much.\u2018Because Evergreen\u2019s faction is neutral.\u2019She doesn\u2019t know about the circumstances of the families if it was about their abilities, but from a logical point of view, there was no reason for Verndia to hate Widnix. Her thoughts were put to rest so Psychke looked at Lillian\u2019s direction. She was on her knees, in a prayer position while on the water, but as stable as the solid ground.Suddenly, a question popped into Psychke\u2019s mind.\u2018Has Lillian held a ceremony in the past?\u2019She doesn\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t do the ceremony at all, or maybe she did, but no one said it to her because she was not competent as per them. At the same time, her attention was not on that, so she couldn\u2019t remember that well.\u2018If Lillian had a superpower, it would naturally come out.\u2019So then, what will happen to me?\u2018The Duke misunderstood that I am the owner of the unmelting ice.\u2019If that misunderstanding is corrected, what will happen to me? Suddenly, shiver ran down to her spine. That ability is something she didn\u2019t want to give to anyone.It was already enough to be mistaken, locked up, and had a hard time alone in Silkisia.\u00a0 However, seeing that she felt like this, she seemed to be attached to him.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u2019Her desire to rely on to someone, and the desire not to be so collided at the same time, nauseous rose. She covered her mouth her hand and right then a large hand wrapped around her feet. As soon as she lifted her eyes, his purple eyes came into vision, which were so near.\u201cYou must be thinking about weird idea again.\u201dVerndia turned his back to Widnix and whispered so that only she could hear it.\u201cDo you know what you look like right now, Princess? I feel like you\u2019re about to bite your tongue and die.\u201d\u201cI will not die.\u201d\u201cThat is what I am saying. Tsk, you\u2019re being stingy.\u201dVerndia took out his clean handkerchief and rolled it around her body like a blanket.\u201cI think this is the 50th time I am talking about it. There is no such thing as an illusion in my life. And even if it is an illusion.\u201dHis self-confidence, as splendid as his superpowers, burned fiercely. Like it was begging her to believe him. Psychke inhaled and held her breath.\u201cI will not turn away from the princess. No, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019ve come too far for that? There are a few secrets of mine that only the Princess knows.\u201dHis long fingers nudged her forehead playfully.\u201cIt is I, not the princess, who needs to be looked after. It\u2019s not the princess who should be nervous, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want this. You\u2019re small like a mouse bean, so there\u2019s no way others can even touch you.\u201dGrinning, he put her in his pocket. It was a bonus that he made a footstool with his hands so that she could see the outside. As her feet touched his hand, her face heated up.\u2018Wh, why are you doing this?\u2019She doesn\u2019t think that the Duke used his ability to her, but why was her forehead so hot? She rubbed her forehead where his fingers touched. The fingers where his purple fire started, but one side of her chest felt warm. She wanted this kind of warmth to stay longer.She squeezed the edge of his pocket and half covered her face. The hem of her clothes touching the tip of her nose conveyed his scent.\u2018Ugh.\u2019It wasn\u2019t even once or twice, but her heart raced wildly. With the ring, she clenched her teeth tightly to keep her feelings from being shared and pressed hard against her heart.He snapped his fingers which caught her attention.\u201cLook closely at the color of the water.\u201dThe ceremony was nearing its end. He was pouring golden holy water over Lillian\u2019s head as she murmured words that the High Priestess could not understand.\u201cIf it won\u2019t change at all, it means no.\u201d\u201cIf you have a superpower, what color will it turn into?\u201d\u201cBlue.\u201dHearing his voice, Widnix immediately intervened.\u201cIt changes to the color unique to that ability. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to see the color of holy water change, but the princess is lucky.\u201d\u201cWhat b*llsh*t are you talking about again, Widnix?\u201d\u201cLiterally.\u201dWidnix didn\u2019t even look at them and brainwashed them.\u201cIt is changing.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Hmm?\u201dHe was not surprised but he still opened his eyes.It was as Widnix said.The color of her holy water was changing from where Lillian\u2019s feet touched.Shhhwaaa-\u201cBlack\u2026. color?\u201dIt was painted as sinister Black.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201d\u201cNonsense. Black?!\u201d\u201cWas there any situation like this?!\u201dThe priests outside the lake were flustered.The same goes to for Lenox, Melissa, Lillian, and even the high priest who oversaw the ceremony. Then, at some point, the High Priest, who came to his senses, hit the water surface with his stuff.\u201cQuiet!\u201dStrangely, something like a clear bell rang out everywhere.\u201cWhat kind of insolence in front of Holy Vicente?!\u201d\u201cBut high priest-!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time-\u201d\u201cHow can we count all of God\u2019s will? It\u2019s something we need to check step by step. Princess Silkisia, move your seat for a while\u2026\u201dThe high priest\u2019s voice gradually faded. It was a windless room, but waves were rising on the black lake. Waves the size of a house started at the edge and gathered in the center. Then, at some point while in the air, jut before it poured over Lillian and the High Priest, it started to stick together.It was a huge black orb.\u201cGod\u2019s word!\u201dSomeone pointed a finger at the black orb and shouted. The high priest did not point out that someone\u2019s rudeness. It was because he has lost his mind over the oracle for the first time in over a hundred years.The black orb was split into two exactly as if it had been cut with a knife. Then each of them turned into parchment and slowly fell off. The high priest politely accepted the two parchments with trembling hands. Psychke\u2019s blue eyes, which had been silently watching the situation, shook.\u2018What?\u2019Sensing the ominous feeling, her chest trembled wildly. Things that had happened before she turn back time quickly passed through her mind. But no matter how much she recalled, this oracle never appeared in that first timeline.What is this, what the hell is this.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely different from the past.\u201dA dry voice tore the air. Her chest sank. Psychke looked up.\u201cIsn\u2019t that so, princess?\u201dLight green eyes that lacked the slightest hint of warmth were directed at her.***Vicente\u2019s temple was closed immediately after hundreds of years of trust. Lillian\u2019s unprecedented discrimination of black holy water was buried without much attention. It goes without saying how great the uproar was due to the trust.\u201cFor now, take this.\u201dReturning to the mansion, Verndia gave Psychke an artifact in the shape of a brooch that Lia had repaired. When she reached for the brooch, her body returned to its original size. But what weird was that the clothes she was wearing grew as well.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because she became smaller with the power of God.\u2019For some reason, Verndia felt sad.\u201cYou can\u2019t wear bells anymore.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dHe added, erasing his sad expression.\u201cYou better not use that more than twelve hours a day, because there are side effects. To solve what is happening to you, hmm, according to the High Priest, I need Widnix\u2019s help.\u201dIs that why Stella brought up the perfume? He almost threatened the high priest, who was flustered by Lillian\u2019s oracle, and got an answer. He pressed his lips.\u201cBecause I once said I\u2019d burn the whole East Coast down if he talks b*llsh*t one more time.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t do that in the temple, did you?\u201d\u201cIt was in the past. As you can see Princess, I\u2019m not the kind of person who likes things like that.\u201dHe concluded by saying that since he was distracted by the ceremony, he did not think he could expect help right away.\u201cLet\u2019s keep in touch with him.\u201dPsychke agreed.Since she had no contact with Widnix, she had no choice but to lean on Verndia.A few days later, however, the emperor summoned the three dukes, and Verndia had to leave the mansion early in the morning according to the emperor\u2019s order.Widnix came to visit her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did the Duke tell him?\u2019After her argument with Lenox in public, she had heard rumors circling around that she had run away from home. Perhaps, it was because she was still silent about Silkisia. Now, she wondered if the fact that she stays over in Verndia\u2019s mansion had spread.\u2018I thought after meeting Stella, Aiden will talk about it.\u2019A brooch was used to restore her original size of body. Psychke was guided by Cecil to the living room.\u201cI heard you found it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWidnix was speechless. Like someone deep in thought, he only looked down at the teacup in front of him on the table, but he was actually a ruthless person. He was originally known for being eccentric. Even though he ignored her words, she didn\u2019t feel much. Psychke stared at him and sat down. At the sound of the teacup being lifted, his light green hair finally swayed.He stared at Psychke with his deeply sunken eyes, then gave out a low-pitched voice.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t the Princess be in Silkisia?\u201d\u201cOh, I am staying here for a brief moment because of work.\u201d\u201cThat was not I meant. You couldn\u2019t get out of Silkisia even after you died, Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dGoosebumps ran down her spine. Psychke almost dropped the teacup in her hand. She doesn\u2019t know what intent lies behind his words, but Widnix knew the world before she turned back time. When she saw the oracle in the temple had changed, she had no idea. Don\u2019t tell her that it was right.\u201cAs expected, you knew.\u201dWhile observing her reaction, Widnix let out a small sigh.\u201cThat was why it had changed.\u201dHer mind went black at his words, she was even unable to refute. She was not guilty of what she did and seemed to be questioning somehow. Loss of words, she let out a long exhale.\u201cWhy did you become so close with Verndia?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, let us change my question. Why did Verndia repeat the same thing but still can\u2019t let go of you, Princess?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What nonsense are you saying?\u201d\u201cIn any case-\u201dThe languid man\u2019s mood changed in an instant. His light green eyes seemed to glow coldly, and the air around them became creepily dim. The window was not even open, but a strong wind blew inside. The hem and her skin were cut. A red solid line was drawn on the back of her neck with a tingling sensation.Correspondingly, her cursed ability that had quietly slumbered was awakened right at that time.\u201c\u2026.!\u201dShe had no way to suppress her cursed ability.As if he wanted to protect his master, cool blue energy came out and seemed like an explosion. He pushed hostility he has to her.\u201c\u2026 As expected.\u201dWidnix, who had a superpower, blinked slowly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Princess was the owner of the unmelting ice.\u201dHer cursed ability was discovered by the third person after Lia and Verndia did. However, the shock of being caught like the previous two was not as great. To be precise, it would be better to describe that she felt troubled.Widnix tried to kill her.Why?Apparently, it was not because of her curse. This time, she was lost of words and couldn\u2019t comprehend.He sighed softly.\u201cPrincess. I don\u2019t want to lose anyone. But if you have no choice but to lose, one is better than two.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGo back to Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What if I don\u2019t want to?\u201dHis eyes felt foreign looking at the scar on her neck.\u201cThen it won\u2019t end with just a warning.\u201dYou will neither die inside Silkisia or rather die in my hands.He gritted his teeth at the blatantly told to die. Something hot rose from within. However, before she could even refute him, Widnix had already stopped her.\u201cThis is the only way to prevent irreversible events. As you can see, the oracle has come down.\u201d\u201cWhat does it have to do with the oracle and me going back to Silkisia?\u201dWidnix looked at her silently. He seemed to be contemplating whether he should answer or not. In the meantime, Psychke pondered over the question posed to her.Oracle, Silkisia, Widnix..And not long after, she found an answer.\u201cIt was because of Lillian.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know the relationship between Silkisia and the oracle since it hasn\u2019t been made public. In regard to the relationship between Widnix and Lilian, she had a thought.\u201cBecause I am a hindrance to her.\u201dWidnix saved Lillian, whole lived at the top of the world, and took her to the temple. He was Lillian\u2019s man. Therefore, since Lillian hated her, Widnix would naturally hate her, too.\u201cNo.\u201dHe was slow but surely denied. He firmly denied it.\u201cSaving Princess Lillian was a mistake.\u201d\u201cMistake?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. It would have been fine if the result was different. I am about to lose you two because of my curiosity.\u201dThe bitterness, as if he had committed an irreparable wrong, appeared on his face, then it was erased quickly.What on earth is he spewing? Psychke asked without hiding her sharp feelings.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018lose two\u2019?\u201d\u201cI will tell you Princess after you return to Silkisia.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to worry.She didn\u2019t want to lie so a quick reply from her was heard.His dry eyes looked at her. He then lowered them.\u201cThen\u2026 it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dHe slowly got up. He scanned her with his eyes mixed underlying unknown emotion, then turned his back. He left her seat, hesitated for a moment and with his low voice, he questioned her.\u201cThere is one thing you should know. Do you know what Verndia did in the past after the Princess died?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhat can she do if she doesn\u2019t?Before she even returned, she was on bad terms with him.Widnix spat out words which only her could hear.\u201cIf you can\u2019t solve the Leas case, the Princess will not be able to escape her death this time either.\u201d\u201c\u2026. I beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cAnd if the unquenchable flame goes out in this timeline, it will be because of the princess, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPsychke froze at his absurd sentence. Her wide opened eyes shook in wariness.***A small conference hall in the Imperial Palace that is only open during important times such as wars and disasters.\u201cIt\u2019s been 285 years.\u201dIn the middle of it, at the end of a long rectangular table, a decrepit high priest gave a trembling voice.\u201cIt\u2019s also the third since the Empire was created.\u201dRed hair, gray eyes like dark clouds in the sky just before rain fall. Adelhide, the emperor of the empire, received the word of the coffin instead.\u2018What happened to him that he doesn\u2019t get old?\u2019Looking at the emperor, who looked like his own age, despite his age, Verndia stuck out his tongue.\u2018Somehow, it seems like he has gotten younger.\u2019\u201cDuke Evergreen is running late.\u201dIt was the prince who was sitting next to the emperor who opened his mouth. It seemed like it would be okay to argue that they were brothers because they looked the same age as their father. He was in the position to inform the royal family and high-ranking nobles in advance before announcing the oracle officially.Emperor, Crown Prince, Logan Silkisia\u2026Verndia looked around the seats in the hall and asked the prince.\u201cIs Her Majesty the Empress absent?\u201d\u201cYes, because she\u2019s unwell.\u201dAs it was a public place, they used respectful words for each other even though they were close friends. Other than the crown prince, the prince and princess would not be able to come to a place like this because they have not celebrated their coming-of-age ceremony. Although Stella is in the capital, she wouldn\u2019t come if she was a royal. Everyone who came besides Widnix was right to come.(TN: So, I just found out that Stella is all along a woman. Haa, so, bear with me as I will edit other chapters. Sorry.)\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201dHe appeared with a low-pitched voice.\u2018Why was the guy who was always the first to come out late?\u2019He felt uncomfortable for some reason. Verndia looked at him crookedly.\u201cThen\u2026 you seem to have arrived, so I will reveal the oracle.\u201dThe high priest opened the golden box with trembling hands. Two scrolls of black parchment lay neatly on the red carpet. He picked up one of them. The oracle of Vicente, unusually, descends in pairs.Either way.You must choose one of two fates that can never be avoided. A decrepit voice read the first oracle.\u201cGlory that has lost its light will consume the light of the sun.\u201dA heavy silence fell over the unusual content. Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the word sun. Even he just rolled his eyes. Even the high priest who had read the oracle was watching him.As if something had happened, the Crown Prince lightly nodded.\u201cAnd the second is?\u201dPlease pray that the second oracle is not related to the emperor. The high priest opened his second scroll with trembling hands.He then read it slowly.\u201cA flower blossomed by silence will rot its roots.\u201dAs the high priest wished, the word sun did not come out, but the second one was also not good.\u201cRoot.\u201dThe emperor muttered as he slanted his chin.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHis eyes captured the Crown Prince, Lestir, Evergreen, and Silksia in turn. Everyone was lost in thought, so they were silent for a while.Then, looking at his father, the Crown prince cautiously expressed his opinion.\u201cTo put it simply, in my understanding, it\u2019s related to the ground because it\u2019s flowers and roots. Coincidentally, the name of Stella\u2019s ability is \u2018silent earth\u2019.\u201d\u201cStella doesn\u2019t have children.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s cold eyes examined the Crown Prince. Then, he turned to Verndia across from him.\u201cWhat does the Duke think?\u201d\u201cI need more time to think.\u201dVerndia answered honestly. Both of them are not good oracles, so it was necessary to go over them as smoothly as possible. As the Crown prince did just now, if he hastily singled out someone, the emperor might try to kill him due to his personality. And in fact, he didn\u2019t like the current emperor. So even if he had found out exactly what the oracle was, he didn\u2019t want to tell it.Forbidden magic is also suspicious, as is ignoring the North. Every time we exchanged words, something he couldn\u2019t pick up pricked his nerves. Shouldn\u2019t they be human?The emperor\u2019s gaze met Widnix and then fell. No matter what he asked, he wouldn\u2019t answer, no, he didn\u2019t even need to ask.As usual, Widnix was just expressionless.Logan, who was pointed out last, was out of luck.\u201cWhatever the roots it, I think we\u2019d choose the second oracle.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt is said that it is enough to pull out the rotten roots, but isn\u2019t the sun that has lost its light never come back?\u201dVerndia glanced at him, wondering if he had oiled his mouth. It was true, so there was nothing to refute. Choosing the first oracle in this position means the same as committing treason.\u2018I guess there wasn\u2019t even a choice in the first place.\u2019\u201cDo you agree?\u201dIt was implied that everyone agreed on the question with a fixed answer.\u201cThen, we can remove the first oracle called \u2018Glory that has lost its light\u2019.\u201dThe emperor arranged it tastelessly.\u201cCan anyone guess?\u201dAs soon as Verndia says anything, he will be the one to bear the responsibility.\u2018Even if there is someone else, he will not tell either way.\u2019Verndia muttered to himself and looked at the people. The Emperor and Widnix had faces that didn\u2019t know what he was thinking. The Crown Prince looked worried since it could imply the Emperor\u2019s downfall, while Logan\u2014\u201cI have a guess.\u201dWhat?Verndia was surprised inside and looked at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To say something like this with that arrogance, he must have seen something. He proudly straightened his back.\u201cI looked at the past oracles before coming here.\u201dThe emperor looked at him as if to continue talking.\u201cThe first oracle was 572 years ago, \u2018Clouds from far away will not create shade\u2019. That year, a foreign minister was elected, and it became a great cornerstone for peace and prosperity.\u201dLogan took a moment to catch his breath.\u201cThe second oracle was back 285 years ago. \u2018The rain that does not fall will corrode the sword\u2019. That year, the Sword Master died at a young age. It was a bloody fight that occurred.\u201dSaying that, Logan looked at Verndia.\u2018Does that mean that he also wanted to die in a love affair?\u2019Verndia\u2019s displeased eyes looked at him.\u201cDo you know what the two oracles have in common?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t they both die due to a love affair?\u201dVerndia answered naturally.\u201cI am well aware of the Chancellor who created the \u2018Peaceful Reign\u2019. He was stabbed to death while in between of a love affair.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s the name.\u201dLogan looked away from him and glanced at everyone.\u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s name is Claudia. It was named after the cloud, and the name of the woman who was in love was Reiner. Ran took her, so-\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s according to the Duke\u2019s words.\u201dVerndia intervened.\u201cI don\u2019t think people like you or others who don\u2019t have origins of the name won\u2019t be able to appear in the oracle. What do you think of this?\u201d\u201c- I think this oracle has something to do with the name.\u201dIgnoring his words, Logan concluded. After a brief gap, Verndia raised a questioning voice.\u201cThen what do you think of the second oracle?\u201d\u201cWe are now talking about the first oracle.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s related to the name, I think the second oracle might be related to the flower, Princess Lillian Silkisia. That means its roots will rot-\u201d\u201cAre you insulting Silkisia right now, Duke?\u201d\u201cI just interpreted it based on the Duke\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201c285 years ago, the oracle that the ancestors prevented was not related to the names.\u201dThe Crown prince cut off his words in an unusual atmosphere.\u201cFurther, there is no guarantee that all oracles will have something to do with names.\u201d\u201c\u2026. That\u2019s right.\u201dLogan gnashed his teeth at Verndia so that no one would notice.\u201cSince the first oracle we decided to eliminate involves His Majesty, we must prepare for all possibilities. Your name is just one of them.\u201dSince the mention of the involvement of the names were endless, Verndia frowned. Logan was now trying to tie the first oracle to a name somehow.\u2018Why?\u2019If it was the accordance with the names related to \u2018Glory\u2019, then those who has such names will be in the list of dying.Among the current nobility\u2026\u2018Baron Dezxion, Marquis of Yurinth.\u2019Both of them are closely related to Silkisia. That person wouldn\u2019t be eating his own flesh\u2026Verndia\u2019s head analyzed things quickly. There must be something in that. 100% only benefit from something that others don\u2019t know about.\u201cThe duke\u2019s words are dangerous.\u201dThe thought that had been digging deep was cut off. Verndia looked at the emperor with his sharp eyes. When an insect entered the house, the emperor was the one to burn the house down to catch it.So, what he should have just said was, \u2018Let\u2019s catch them all.\u2019 He was not going to refute Logan\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026. I was just speaking based on past events.\u201dLogan explained that there was no such thing as selfishness. Verndia felt an embarrassment in his tone.\u2018I guess the emperor didn\u2019t know that.\u2019The story became more and more mysterious.What was it?What was I missing? Judging from the emperor coming out, there must be something. Something big that shouldn\u2019t be passed over-\u201cAnyway, time is needed for that.\u201dAfter everyone was silent for a long time, the emperor declared the meeting was adjourned.\u201cThe next meeting will be held in a month, after the Crown prince\u2019s birthday banquet. Of course, if you have a different opinion before that, you can always tell me.\u201d* * *The Emperor proposed a luncheon after a short break. Taking advantage of that opportunity, Verndia contacted Isolet, who was waiting in the waiting room.\u201cLook into the names of the aristocrats who have fallen out of Logan\u2019s favor. Every place that has fallen or is left with only a name.\u201d\u201cCan we make it a higher priority than finding a place for a date?\u201dAfter taking it for about 5 years, it wasn\u2019t normal to notice. The place of the date is important, but the oracle was more important now.\u201cYes. We need to find out what Logan is up to.\u201d\u201cHmm. Is it really the right name?\u201dIsolet scratched his head, his face completely incomprehensible to him.\u201cDezxion and Yurinth both took their names from \u2018Glory\u2019, but they seem to be far from the formula of \u2018lost light\u2019. Aren\u2019t they all doing well?\u201d\u201cSo we need to find out more.\u201d\u201cCould it be a trap? Like an ulterior motive to divert attention.\u201d\u201cIf you saw the duke when he said that you wouldn\u2019t blurt such words.\u201dVerndia asserted.\u201cLogan, that person can\u2019t manage his facial expressions. He seemed to have a certain corner of faith.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Well, the Duke of Silkisia is famous for not even stepping into a situation where there is no chance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too risky to be called a trap. Rather, it\u2019s more reasonable to try to bury someone with an oracle.\u201dBut Logan failed. The emperor, who should have taken his side, showed a passive reaction. He even gave the deadline of one month to think about it, as his own life and death were at stake.Why?There was only one answer.\u201cHis Majesty must have guessed who the person trying to bury was.\u201dVerndia, touched his lips with his index finger while staring at the floor and raised her eyes.\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you withheld the opinion of the Duke of Silkisia?\u201d\u201cRight. So, I think.\u201dVerndia sat, and crossed his knees and put his hands on top of his lap.\u201c\u2018Glory that has lost its light\u2019 is a person. As Logan said, it must be a name related to glory.\u201dIsolet listened to him.\u201cAnd that person is likely to be a thorn in Logan\u2019s part and needed by the Emperor.\u201d\u201cIs there anyone like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to look for it.\u201d\u201cHave you guessed him already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201dHe understood what Isolet was trying to say. If the emperor knew right away, then he must be a famous nobleman, but why can\u2019t he know that person was?However, he really doesn\u2019t know. Verndia went through the list of imperial nobles in his head. One, two, ten, twenty-He doesn\u2019t know. He really doesn\u2019t know\u2026. Wait.\u201cAbout Princess Psychke.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve looked at about 20 dating places.\u201d\u201cNot that\u2026 that\u2019s it.\u201dVerndia made an impression. He tapped on the handle of his chair and fell into his own thoughts once again.\u2018She is a princess, but she has very little memory of before she was adopted. So, the name Psychke is-\u2018There was a high probability that Logan named her.So, what was her name before she was adopted?\u2018Maybe it has something to do with glory.\u2019His fingers stopped tapping on his chair. Right at that moment.\u201cYou are here, Duke.\u201dAn attendant announced the emperor\u2019s call.He has to go back and ask the Psychke.Verndia captured his thoughts at once.* * *As the status of the participants was great, the luncheon at the imperial palace was extremely splendid. Looking at the generous sprinkling of spices, equivalent to a year\u2019s worth of living for a commoner household, Verndia imagined what it would be like if the princess were here.\u2018She might not be able to eat and run away.\u2019Growing up as the daughter of the duchy, she was not blunt with her money.\u2018It must mean that she was persecuted as much in Silkisia.\u2019That was how much he thought he should do better. When giving a sword, he waved his hand and stepped back.She was cute and lovely. If he could see that reaction once again, what would he give her?\u2018I won\u2019t take anything too burdensome. What should I give her?\u2019A smile crept across his lips. A thought once started could not be stopped. Verndia kept thinking of Psychke.(TN: Man is whipped\u2026 wow.)He remembered those times when she whimpered, but her lips and tried to rise every time she fall to the ground.\u201cDuke.\u201dA foot kicked him under the tablecloth. It was the Crown prince sitting across from him. Waking up from his thoughts, Verndia raised his gaze to him. Everyone was looking at him.He quickly straightened his expression.\u201cI am sorry. I was worried about what to eat at this grand dinner, so I couldn\u2019t hear you. What did you say again?\u201dA guy who doesn\u2019t even like to eat, laughs like a madman while thinking about what to eat first? The Crown prince wanted to ask, but he answered the question as long as it was his seat.\u201cIt was a simple greeting to see how you are getting along with Princess Silkisia.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 we\u2019re doing well.\u201d\u201cI heard you two don\u2019t get along well.\u201dLogan intervened. His eyes were full of hostility.\u2018That b*stard\u2019s discord.\u2019Neither the Princess cares about other people\u2019s attention, but this question was becoming annoying.\u201cRumors are different from the truth.\u201d\u201cJust as monsters do not spawn where there is no magic, I don\u2019t think rumors would have arisen where there is nothing.\u201dVerndia smirked at him. He hated beating around the bush. Logan knew what to say.\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d\u201cIf you took my daughter, shouldn\u2019t you treat her well?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, what did you say?\u201dSlowly, the tableware landed on a plate. The crown prince, who was preparing to mediate if the conversation overheated, questioned innocently.\u201cWho took whom from whom?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if saying that Verndia should listen carefully.\u2018The Crown Prince is always just like this due to lacking managing his facial expression.\u2019Verndia said to his mine. The Emperor and Logan are a pair. No matter what Widnix says, he\u2019ll just watch. This kind of game only targets one person- the Crown Prince.\u201cHaven\u2019t I already told you? Rumors are different from the truth. You don\u2019t have to worry. Princess is living happily enough.\u201d\u201cDuke of Lestir. Is that true?\u201dThe Crown prince\u2019s voice trembled as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cDid the Duke really take Princess Silkisia?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVerndia replied coolly.\u201cThe princess was having a hard time, so I brought her home with me.\u201dA look of wonder crossed Logan\u2019s face.\u2018I guess this man thought I wouldn\u2019t admit that easily.\u2019Logan\u2019s thoughts were clearly visible just by his expression. Verndia crossed his smiled and curved up his lips. The reason why Logan didn\u2019t inform about Psychke\u2019s escape was that he thought it would not help his reputation. But well, that foolish Lenox ruined it all.He slapped Psychke in front of everyone. So, Logan will use that to stir Verndia\u2019s relation with the Crown Prince.\u2018It\u2019s not a bad plan.\u2019His opponent was not that better at all.\u201cDuke of Lestir. Can you explain?\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s gray eyes became bitter. If Verndia ties with Silkisia, his relationship with the Crown Prince will drop drastically.Verndia responded naturally.\u201cAs I said, Princess\u2019s life is Silkisia was hard.\u201d\u2018Then why would you take care of her?\u2019That question flashes across the Crown Prince\u2019s face.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Your Highness heard it, but the Second Prince of Silkisia once slapped the princess on the cheek.\u201d\u201c\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also on the boulevard where everyone can see it.\u201dThe Crown Prince heard it from the rumors, but he never knew it was real. His face turned paler than earlier. As if holding back his anger, Logan\u2019s face turned red hearing Verndia\u2019s continuous revelation.\u201cThat was not all. I once visited Silkisia to visit the Princess but the Second Duke ran with a horse whip as soon as he saw her. I felt like my life was threatened at the same time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe knew the horsewhip? Logan\u2019s expression changed to match the Crown Prince\u2019s expression.\u201cMoreover, the Duke was coercive. The princess\u2019s hand that motioned \u2018No\u2019-\u201d\u201cSo, are rumors of discord the result of what you did?\u201dLogan, who came to his senses belatedly, turned the topic around to turn into a family problem.\u201cI admit that the atmosphere in the house has been ruined since the return of my biological daughter. However, that is something I, the head of the family, have to manage. Even though you two are engaged, it is not a matter for the duke, who is an \u2018outsider\u2019, to intervene in my family affairs.\u201dHe emphasized the word outsider, which made the Crown Prince suspicious.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dEven it means he loses that \u2018person.\u2019 Verndia frowned because the Crown Prince was easily swayed. He gave this man a power so that he could keep an eye to the emperor but this man wouldn\u2019t be off a better emperor, either.\u201cI never planned to say until that though.\u201dHe pretended that it was a mistake and that he regretted it.\u201cActually, the princess shared a part of the \u2018Book of Devil\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026!\u201dLogan was stunned by the name of the book that popped out of nowhere.Book of Devil.A book that condenses the knowledge of Silkisia and studies all the monsters in the dungeon.Logan had been asking her about it due to emergency, but he refused because he hated the fact that he would be taught by a kid who was not even a biological blood of Silkisia. There were also other reasons.But who told her that?\u2018I guess he didn\u2019t expect it.\u2019Verndia leisurely looked at the face that was slowly rising in anger. Then he opened his mouth, and he immediately intercepted it.\u201cThe duke, who was kind to the north, did it for us. Without any cost. It\u2019s late, but I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dLogan was at a loss for words. At Verndia\u2019s words, the careless Crown prince intervened.\u201cReally? It must have been a difficult decision, but that was great.\u201dThe Crown Prince has already dropped the topic, but it was different from Logan. He gritted his teeth and opened his mouth, unwilling to stop.\u201cAs much as you are experiencing difficulties due to something unprecedented\u2026 it\u2019s only natural\u2026 isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d\u201cAside that, the Princess ha offered more than one or two help to the North even though it was usually hard to do so.\u201dGlancing at Logan\u2019s quivering mouth, he spoke calmly.\u201cThanks to that, I can breathe a lot. That was why I helped the Princess in need.\u201d\u201cThat was very different from the rumors.\u201dThe Crown prince pointed out the rumor that Psychke was incompetent and not working hard.Verndia laughed.\u201cYour Highness will be surprised at how clever she is. Aren\u2019t there rumors spreading between me and the princess?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Then\u2026\u201dThe Crown prince looked at him like someone who wanted to say something difficult. Are you going to get married with her might be what he was thinking.Verndia raised his eyebrows. He wanted to tell that it was out of his business, but\u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot of trouble, Duke.\u201dThe emperor, who had been watching him and Logan\u2019s argument with a blank expression all the time, opened his mouth. It was an indescribable voice.\u201cDuke of Silkisia.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the dungeon was almost closed?\u201d\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201dWhy is this story coming out now, Logan became a puzzled expression. On the contrary, Verndia guessed the emperor\u2019s intentions.\u2018He didn\u2019t lend a hand to the North on the pretext of closing the dungeon in the South.\u2019Even that dungeon hadn\u2019t caused any problems for decades. Because of just that, people who didn\u2019t have to die died.Verndia trembled once again in anger.\u201cYou can withdraw from the south soon.\u201dArrogant gray eyes reached Verndia. Now that the emperor was here, he was upset but he can\u2019t reject the offer, too.Verndia lowered his head and muttered words that were not in his heart.\u201cThank you for Your Majesty\u2019s deep consideration.\u201d\u201cIt must have been a lot of burden since it was an unwanted engagement between you two.\u201dA moment of doubt passed through the eyes of the Crown prince and Logan. It was the same with Verndia. Wasn\u2019t he the one who urged the engagement? It was not like the emperor was giving him medicine or something.\u2018What is he planning?\u2019As if enjoying their gazes, the emperor lazily tilted his glass. Only after the clear liquid had disappeared halfway, he turned the glass around and talked.\u201cNot too long ago, the messenger of Hestie asked for a private meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey said they want to have a close relationship with the Empire and through marriage.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026.\u201dVerndia was stunned.Hestie was a small kingdom at the northern end of the continent. It snows all year round there, and there is a snowstorm that one can\u2019t even see an inch ahead.A land not worth conquering because of the weather conditions. No one wants to marry someone from a small country. Even though the emperor knew that, there was no way he would have said such a thing out of boredom.If so, what could he be planning?\u201cJust in time, the heir to the throne of Hestie is looking for a wife for him.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cAs you know, there is no princess in the imperial family who is ready to marry, so she tried to ask the Duke of Silkisia for his understanding.\u201dUnfeeling gray eyes scanned Logan\u2019s face.Perhaps because Logan was already informed about it, he didn\u2019t show any unusual expression.\u201cI felt bad because I felt like I was tearing my blood and kin back after 10 years.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Princess Psychke of Silkisia wants to leave Silkisia-\u201dThe emperor\u2019s eyes focused on Verndia. His face was distorted beyond description.\u201cThe duke seems like an opportunity to end an unwanted engagement with the Princess.\u201d\u201cYour majesty.\u201dHe managed to prevent himself from swearing at the Emperor. His cod purple eyes were looking at him, narrowed.\u201cThe princess is my fianc\u00e9.\u201dPurple sparks flew around him in his imagination. Even though he took the medicine before coming to the imperial palace, he looked like he was so angry. The emperor tilted his head boredly. It was a face that didn\u2019t comprehend his kind of reaction.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to break up?\u201d\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201dAn angry voice soared high in the sky.\u201cWhat does it have to do with my wish to break off the marriage and the princess going there after our breakup?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why Duke is acting like this when Silkisia hasn\u2019t said anything yet.\u201d\u201cThe Princess is my fianc\u00e9.\u201dVerndia gnashed his teeth.\u201cInsulting my fianc\u00e9 is insulting me, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear what you just said.\u201dDisgusting.He felt that the emperor was disgusting, and he was going to get crazy.He made the excuse that he was not feeling well and got up. He didn\u2019t want to be here any longer.\u201cDuke.\u201dAs he was about to leave, the emperor called and stopped him. Verndia looked at him reluctantly.The emperor was expressionless as usual. However, the gray eyes were colder than ever.A suffocating silence surrounded them. If air had weight, one would hear a heavy sinking sound. It was the emperor who broke the silence.\u201cIt sounds like the Duke has no intention of breaking up with the princess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVerndia readily acknowledged it.\u201cI have no intention of breaking up with my fianc\u00e9.\u201dThe shocked Crown prince\u2019s gaze reached him, but he ignored it. What is he going to do if Verndia twists his plan?He turned around and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Verndia left without permission, the dining room remained silent. After the meal, Logan secretly requested an audience with the emperor. It was to convince him about the oracle.However, the emperor did not accept his request. So, he was about to return to Silkisia without any progress.\u201cDuke-\u201dAs he was about to climb into the carriage, a soft voice called him. It was Shiona dressed as an imperial attendant.Even though he was neatly dressed, his sexuality can not be hidden, so Logan took a step back with a frown.Shiona, who guided him to a deserted place, smiled brightly.\u201cHow was the meeting? His Majesty doesn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It didn\u2019t go well.\u201dTo be honest, Logan had already known about the oracle before he stepped into the meeting room. And that was thanks to Shiona, who planted an informant inside the temple. That was why he got to connect other previous oracles with these three present oracles.Shiona frowned at his response.\u201cBecause of His Majesty?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAh, what a pity. I thought he would gibe up because such oracles came out.\u201dShiona crossed her arms and kicked the ground nervously. Looking at her like that, Logan, who was thinking about something about her for a while, asked a question.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t fake it?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, no matter how much I do, I can\u2019t even change the oracle.\u201dShiona smiled with a very regretful smile. Her red lips drew a dark arc.\u201cHow can you change the word of God when humans can\u2019t even erase even one of his powers?\u201d\u201cAh, righr. What about the sacrifice of the magic circle you talked about back then?\u201d\u201cIs that necessary to ask about that again?\u201dHer reply was sullen with a groan, twisting her hair.\u201cIt went bankrupt thanks to the wonderful sabotage of that princess.\u201d\u201cWho am I to blame for my shortcomings? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to use something like that.\u201dIt\u2019s still the same to ignore the topic that they had been together for ten years. Shiona lifted curved her mouth at the words that demeaned her forbidden magic. When she found out that her son was in \u2018something like that\u2019, she was looking forward to how that lofty man\u2019s face would be distorted.\u201cThen the Duke will do it.\u201d\u201cEhem.\u201d\u201cAh, really. Why is everyone so upset that they can\u2019t catch her?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. If only it could erase Psychke\u2019s superpowers, even for a moment. So, if only His Majesty could give up that child\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing this because that doesn\u2019t work!\u201dShiona stretched her hands and folded them, but didn\u2019t forget to tap on Logan\u2019s nose, with her pathetic expression.\u201cIt is the power of God. The power of Vicente! Do you think that is easy to erase? Still, that d**ned Hillace burned down the research, so it\u2019s going to be hard to restore it!\u201dHe felt offended by the woman treating him like a child so he slapped her hand roughly.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s more urgent to erase Lestir\u2019s ability than her, right? We only need to ensure that Princess Psychke drinks tea every morning, but Lestir finds out because she couldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cThe princess used her supernatural ability in front of Lestir, and our festival project failed due to that! His Majesty was so displeased at me. Ah, why did I say that!?\u201dThis mouth of hers.D*mn this mouth!Even though she said that the princess used her ice. Shiona slapped her fist on her mouth. Even if she wasn\u2019t excited about the supernatural power of ice she heard about.\u201cPsychke used her superpowers in front of Lestir?\u201d\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t hear?\u201dShiona widened her eyes. Then it curved like her crescent moon.\u201cYou are not being trusted, then.\u201dAt the teasing tone, Logan clenched his fists. Was that why Lestir took Psychke from Silkisia?\u201cThat\u2019s right. She used it. Therefore, sooner or later, everything that had been hidden would be revealed soon. I\u2019ve been tracking down the necklace in Lestir, but if he finds it first, they\u2019ll know what have done-\u201cEnraged, Logan grabbed her by the collar and pushed her against the wall.\u201cErase that child\u2019s superpower right now.\u201d\u201cOh, is this a threat?\u201dHis eyes were colder than of emperor which made her smile brightly.\u201cI rescued a person who fell into the water, and he asked me to pay for it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLet go now. Otherwise, I\u2019ll tell His Majesty everything. For example, the things you did to suppress the Princess\u2019s abilities.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cThey have been asking the same question for over ten years; When will her superpowers wake up. Because of that, the emperor even tied her up with Lestir. If she knew she had been holding back from waking up long ago-\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be hard to die well?Shiona pulled out her tongue and wrapped herself around her neck, pretending to die. Logan gnashed his teeth.\u201cI won\u2019t have it alone.\u201d\u201cOh, I am not dying. If I try to kill a princess, you won\u2019t even know, right?\u201dShiona let out a thread of her incomprehensible laugh. Logan glared at her ferociously, then he forced himself to let her go. Shiona elegantly straightened her wrinkled collar.\u201cPlease make a meeting with the princess soon.\u201dLogan looked at her curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s His Majesty\u2019s order. He told me to separate her from Lestir. I\u2019ll have to take a look at her magic to check her out.\u201dCrumpling his face, he shot her as if to argue.\u201cWhat for is the meeting? Because of that b*stard Lestir, I can\u2019t even approach her.\u201d\u201cEhh? You\u2019re her father. Even though her father will approach her, she won\u2019t even listen?\u201dLogan\u2019s face hardened even more. Shiona expression changed similarly.\u201cYou are really useless. You and your son are the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Son?\u201dAt the mention of his son, Logan\u2019s face hardened. It was quite the sight, and Shiona laughed.* * *Meanwhile. Shortly after Widnix left Lestir\u2019s mansion.Psychke locked herself inside her room.Skipping breakfast and lunch, she moved her quill to organize something.\u2018I won\u2019t die in vain like before.\u2019Widnix\u2019s words tightened the reins of her slack mind.\u2018Unless the Leas case is resolved, death is inevitable..\u2019He said she was a victim of the Leas case, so she was thinking of trying to find what happened about it.She didn\u2019t even know that the incident of Leas was related to her death in the first timeline. Despite that she died because of the fake emerald necklace.For now-\u2018I need to find the emerald necklace Lillian is making. Let\u2019s start there.\u2019She was not playing because her body got smaller. She had asked information from Guild to investigate the three workshops that Lillian had commissioned.And that information was now in her hands. All the preparations are done, the only thing left to do was to put it into action. She kicked off her seat and got up. She knew that if Croa knew, that crow would try to follow her, so she sneaked out of the mansion.* * *The place Psychke was heading to was 271-2 Corte.It was a master craftsman\u2019s ore stone shop, which is now said to be the best in the capital.\u300c \u201cWe don\u2019t accept requests.\u201d \u300dShe simply ignored the notice written in large letters in front of the door and went in.With a jingle, the small bell at the top of the door rang.\u201cWe are not accepting requests.\u201dThe craftsman acted brusquely, covering the workbench with a cloth. If he was proud of his workmanship, he wouldn\u2019t be afraid to show off them off.Showing off how perfectly crafted it was will also help him receive additional requests. So, Psychke guessed that there was the emerald necklace of Lilian under that cloth. He probably didn\u2019t want to be caught crafting dangerous items like Keitan\u2019s necklace.\u201cLady Hilvia Esland has sent me.\u201dAs she left the mansion, she borrowed a male employee\u2019s clothes. She also changed her appearance with her bracelet before entering the crafting shop.She was pretending to be Hilvia\u2019s errand boy.\u201cHmm? The lady always comes in person.\u201d\u201cShe is currently sick, so I came instead of her.\u201dThe craftsman looked at her unsure. It was to be expected. Psychke took out a pink fan that sparkled with all sorts of jewels.It had been dropped by someone who ran away after begging her to marry him.\u201cHe said he could show you this. If you still don\u2019t believe me, you can send someone to her right now.\u201dWherever she went, Hilvia never took her fan off her body. She said one couldn\u2019t even touch her unless she was a limb. It means that there is affection for her fan.\u2018Although word got around that Hilvia lost her debt, and she got a new one.\u2019She had worked out beforehand to prevent her suspicions just in case she didn\u2019t know.\u2018She spread rumors that the fan had already been dismantled and sold to a jeweler.\u2019She put several jewels she has on the fan and sold them to a jeweler. Rumors with evidence becomes the truth. It was known that the missing folding fan of Hilvia was sold. Sure enough, the jeweler shook his head without a question.\u201cNo. She\u2019ll have to trust you enough to pay her fan. What\u2019s your business?\u201d\u201cHer lady wants to cancel the necklace in the making.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Yes?\u201dThe shocked craftsman\u2019s expression stiffened. That response convinced Psychke that her guess was correct. The craftman couldn\u2019t have accepted a request in creating a necklace without a guarantee.\u201cEven if it was for a family member, she wanted to cancel it no matter what.\u201d\u201cNo, you wrote a contract, and now what are you saying?\u201d\u201cI mean.\u201dPsychke convinced herself that the man in front of her was Isolet. And she sincerely comforted him.(TL: Remember that she disguised herself as a man, btw.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But due to that, she also cancelled all of her requests this month\u2026.\u201dAccording to the Information Guild, this man was way too talented that people never stopped requesting. However, because his money at that time was spent on his sick family, he couldn\u2019t afford creating new crafts.In simpler words, he would not have done Hilvia\u2019s request if it means to have a lot of money, despite the danger. He would have at least put a safety device to save himself.\u201cHow can you not?\u201dThe craftsman retorted as he removed the cloth covering the workbench.\u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s almost done. I did it a month\u2019s shorter than expected.\u201d\u2018He didn\u2019t have to be in a hurry though.\u2019He picked up the emerald craft with an unwilling grumble. The burdensomely colorful front work was blocking the space for the needle inside.\u201cHow much time left?\u201d\u201cA week, no, three days.\u201d\u201cAll right. However, the lady said she wanted to cancel, so what should I do\u2026\u201dShe stretched out her hand as if she was really feeling sorry. The craftsman began begging him if he could somehow the convince the Young Lady\u2019s decision.\u201cHow dare I do that.\u201d\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re usually trusted enough to trust and leave debts, but please, please.\u201d\u201c\ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd80\ucc44\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubbff\uace0 \ub9e1\uae30\uc2e4 \uc815\ub3c4\uba74 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\uc2e0 \uac83 \uac19\uc740\ub370, \uc81c\ubc1c \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u201dThe craftsman still begged, saying that his living would be bleak if this was cancelled. Psychke waited for him to fret, then pretended that she also had no other way, but to let go of his luck.\u201cHooh\u2026. I can\u2019t help it.\u201dThe craftsman raised his head.\u201cI will try to convince the Young Lady to change her mind. However, there is a problem.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what the lady wrote in the contract, so I don\u2019t know what to say to her.\u201d\u201cIt is here.\u201dShe only said her piece without expecting anything. She realized that the craftsman was really desperate then. He took the paper out of the padlocked box and held it in his hands.It was the contract.\u2018I never thought I\u2019d see this.\u2019She hid her surprised feelings under an expressionless expression and read the content of the contract.\u2018As expected, if there is a disturbance related to the necklace in the future, they will take responsibility for it and take it out.\u2019Hilvia\u2019s signature remained at the bottom of the memorandum.\u2018Tsk.\u2019It was a simple contract, but not stupid, she thought. Or perhaps that was not the case. Maybe, Lillian\u2019s resources are far good enough to create this kind of contract? While clicking her tongue, her gaze averted to the date of the signature.\u2018It\u2019s the day after the day we met.\u2019Let\u2019s see. Hilvia seemed to know a little as to why Lillian decided this necklace to be made.\u2018It\u2019s because of the money.\u2019What Hilvia\u2019s experience was pictured in her mind. The day she was blackmailed by loan sharks. Hilvia would not have known until she arrived at the shop that the correspondence was a request to reproduce the poison needle necklace. Hence, she was shocked and left the store.The next day, she must have fallen for Lillian\u2019s sugarcoated words and signed with the craft shop again.\u2018She must have said that she would not spend the money out of nothing. Hilvia must have given her a lot of money, then.\u2019Even if she doesn\u2019t use this necklace, even if she tries to reproduce it, it\u2019s a criminal act, either way.\u2018Maybe she didn\u2019t even think about that far because she was putting out the fire right away.\u2019Whatever it was, Psychke couldn\u2019t comprehend and disagrees with this kind of action. In the first place, Lillian\u2019s behavior was filthy. Why go through all this hassle just to reproduce Keitan\u2019s necklace?Which means, if Hilvia only gave up and reported the case to the Imperial Family, Lillian would have been dead.\u2018Is there any other reason besides trying to frame me?\u2019She was a not person that can\u2019t be killed unlike the emperor or Verndia. The Assassination Guild would accept any number of requests if one gave them money. Why bother making something like a poison needle necklace?\u2018Was the story of Leas was that impressive?\u2019She pointed at the possibilities and pulled out her bag of gold coins. It was a stake of jewelry brought from Silkisia.\u201cThis was originally a cancellation fee, but can I use this as a deposit and take the emerald for a while?\u201cAh, whatever you want.\u201d\u201cI will return it as soon as the persuasion is over. Until then, I hope you will not contact me even if it takes a little longer. If you force urging her, she will never change her mind.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dHe didn\u2019t worry that the Marquis of Esland would eat them off. The craftsman smiled brightly at the mere persuasion.\u201cOh yeah. I\u2019m just saying this to help you convince her.\u201dShe was in the middle of preparing to leave, packing the emeralds out of sight. The jeweler secretly leaked information.\u201cRecently, rumors circulated that they found the real Keitan necklace in \u2018Blue Moon\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cFor once, you should go with Young Lady. She asked me to make it like it was the beauty of the real thing, so if she sees the real one, maybe her mind will change.\u201dThe craftsman said something more, but she couldn\u2019t here them.Blue moon.It was the camouflage name of the guild that lent money to Hilvia, the Black Moon, when it was active as a guild.***\u2018What should I say to approach him?\u2019She was worried as she passed through the street full of merchants at high speed. Well, it\u2019s okay to go and show it to her. Will it be so easy to show it to someone who has no one-sided knowledge?\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019Originally, Keitan\u2019s necklace was supposed to be kept in the imperial palace as evidence of the attempted assassination of the imperial family. So, if it became known that they had found the real thing, it was obvious that the imperial family would come and try to steal it.\u2018It looks like it\u2019s fake this time too.\u2019If it was information that a single merchant knew, there was little chance that it would be true. It was most likely a trap to catch the client trying to reproduce Keitan\u2019s necklace.But.Even knowing that, she decided to confront it head-on. Because it has some connections of her death in her past life.Psychke visited several more stonecutters and jewelers. After gathering additional information like that, she headed for the blue moon. There was nothing good about finding out that she was tracking the necklace, so she didn\u2019t use the magic to change her appearance to her real one.* * *Indeed, the inside of the building was splendid, probably because it was the headquarters of one of the upper floors. The first and second floors selling goods were plastered with gold and precious stones. It felt like entering the waiting room of an illegal auction house.\u2018It feels amazing.\u2019Psychke intervened among the customers and pretended to be looking at the merchandises around. Then, as she passed in front of the top staff, she pretended to drop the necklace by accident.The emerald rolled on the floor with a clear clang.She watched carefully as the employee\u2019s eyes scanned the grooves inside the jewel.\u201cThis.\u201dShe picked it up as if it was a mistake but after standing up, she dropped it once more. She sat in the resting area, waiting for someone to come. Of course, she took off her earrings in case there was an unexpected situation. And less than five minutes later, a shadow fell over her head.\u201cSomehow, I was wondering why an Esland is here.\u201dA voice she had never heard before. A Western accent that came in her ears oddly. Psychke raised her head.\u201cAre we acquaintances?\u201dA man, who had a long knife mark on one of his cheeks, smirked while asking Hilvia about the debt.* * *The reason Psychke dropped the emerald necklace was because she had confirmed that the information given by the craftsman was not a trap before going here.\u2018The blue moon brought in new accessories. Have you heard anything?\u2019\u2018No, not at all.\u2019\u2018I haven\u2019t heard of it.\u2019All of them had the same answer. An ordinary gemstone craftsman could not have better intelligence than other merchants. It\u2019s not like the merchants are lying knowingly.Is there any reason for them to hide?If it was information that should have been kept hidden in the first place, it should not have entered the ears of a stone craftsman. In other words, it was highly likely that the Blue Moon intentionally spilled it after grabbing the target.\u2018But for what reason?\u2019First, when she was in the auction house, it was a trap to catch those tracking the Leas case.Second, for curiosity or whatever, just to meet the requester of the necklace.Psychke judged it to be the latter.\u2018If I were the head of the assassination guild, I would have kidnapped her right away, though.\u2019Knowing what the craftsman was doing means that they also found out who the client was.However, instead of using force, information was leaked. She understood that it meant that they wanted rumors to spread. And, judging from the reaction of the man walking ahead, that seemed to be the correct answer.\u201cEsland also has no answer.\u201dThe man said that knowing that Psychke was not from Esland. She went up to the stairs silently, agreeing with his words. It was a very narrow and dark staircase that one could barely pass by. Although fighting in a narrow space was disadvantageous, she did not let down her guard.Psychke squeezed her earring.\u201cIt was unusual to recognize that I belonged to a guild in the first place.\u201dWhen they reached the fourth floor, he led her to a room at the end of a long hallway.\u201cI never thought you would even come looking for me as a handicraft client.\u201dClick, she closed the door. At the same time, Psychke converted her earring into a sword and struck it with all her might.Chak!Sparks flew in the dark space. Her icy eyes stared at the man with the dagger.\u201cThat was such a welcome.\u201d\u201cMy neck stings.\u201dThe man preventing the dagger to struck his neck with a nonchalant face shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWhere are you hiding that sword? I must learn a few things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be stuck in your neck next time.\u201d\u201cRemember.\u201dShe pulled out a hard chair. She went to the other side of the desk and sat in an overstuffed chair.Then, in a familiar motion, she took a cigarette out of the drawer and smoked it.\u201cMy throat hurts.\u201dWhen she sat down and just looked down, he laughed nonchalantly. Psychke calmly looked at him, blowing away the flying smoke with her hand.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have the real necklace, so, what\u2019s your business?\u201d\u201cWhat if I really have it?\u201dThe man with his legs crossed on the desk rummaged through the drawers, picked up something shiny, and told her to take a look of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, even if that necklace was real, there was no emerald that should have been there. The iconic part was empty.\u201cAre you asking me to believe that?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you? I feel likewise.\u201dAs if it was a natural reaction, the man nodded his head.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, try hitting it with a sword.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know why this man was asking her to strike an important piece of evidence with her sword, but she shouldn\u2019t pretend not to know anything. Besides, there was no reason for her to follow his words obediently.\u201cDo it yourself. You have to exert that much effort.\u201d\u201cI thought about it again and I will repeat it again. What if my hand goes to your neck instead towards the necklace?\u201d\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t know my neck would fall first.\u201dAs if to take the lead, the two pairs of eyes scrutinized each other. After a moment of silence, the man gently laughed.\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re quite the celebrity.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhat kind of trick is he putting up?\u201cYou went to our auction house, together with Duke Lestir, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAh, she didn\u2019t expect this.\u2018He told me he took care of all the witnesses so how is this man knew about it?\u2019The man in front of her didn\u2019t miss how her blue eyes fluctuated momentarily. He turned and folded his fingers one at a time.\u201cYou\u2019re curious. Even if we had set a trap there, why was it quiet now and why did we let go of the case despite knowing who the thief was? Is this necklace real?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat would be our answer?\u201dAfter that, he exhaled cigarette smoke. In an instant, he was the leading of the conversation and Psychke, at that time, finally calmed her heart down.\u2018Calm down, stay calm.\u2019She swallowed her dry saliva. She hid what she was really feeling under an expressionless expression. She thought who in several thoughts and responded calmly.\u201cPerhaps, it was not because you didn\u2019t leave it, but it was something you couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cDuke Lestir was an untouchable mad dog from the north. While the other one was an unknown figure with no information.\u201dPerhaps he should have asked in bewilderment, the man\u2019s eyebrows went down slightly. And Psychke continued,\u201cOne, you couldn\u2019t approach a situation where you don\u2019t know what kind of relationship with the Duke of Lestir and if you approach him wrong, you\u2019ll get bitten by that mad dog.\u201dThe man who heard the correct answer showed curiosity that could not be hidden in the man\u2019s face. He forgot that he was smoking a cigarette and leaned forward.\u201cSecond is?\u201d\u201cThe real client of the necklace and the person behind was Hilvia Esland. She must have wanted to meet you quietly. Seeing you come out here, it must have been your own act, not the guild\u2019s will.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cLilian Silkisia. Right?\u201d\u201cThat woman.\u201dThe man touched the corner of his mouth that was bursting into laughter with his scarred hand.\u201cThen what about the third?\u201d\u201cI think I said this far, so I deserve an answer.\u201dPsychke returned the question.\u201cIs that fake?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThe man who lit up the cigarette put the necklace in a drawer.\u201cIt\u2019s a bomb.\u201dShe was thinking of killing him.\u201cHe came all the way here, so I thought he\u2019d try to knock it down, but it turned out to be a pity.\u201dIn his words, Psychke realized something.\u2018Is the way to check if it\u2019s real? To hit it with a sword?\u2019\u201cBy the way, what about this?\u201dHis dark brown eyes, smiling but devoid of warmth, scanned him.\u201cThe fish that asked me to come didn\u2019t come, so I caught another fish. Although this seems like a formidable big fish.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit different from the plan\u2026 but this isn\u2019t bad either. Are you close with Duke Lestir?\u201dCreepy sounds were heard.There was no reason for her to hand over information so she turned her back to him. But she couldn\u2019t hold the doorknob and looked at the man when she heard,\u201cPsychke Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dMy heart sank. Did she get caught?\u201cI want to meet her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Why?\u201dThank god. She didn\u2019t get caught.But why?Instead of answering, the man said something else.\u201cTell that to Duke Lestir. Come hang out with her fianc\u00e9e in the Blue Moon.\u201d\u201cI refuse. The Princess\u2026 I don\u2019t think she wants to associate with someone like you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it will end, well. Then how about this?\u201dHe had the look of a hunter throwing prey that he could never miss.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you who has Keitan\u2019s necklace.\u201d\u201cStop lying\u2014\u201d\u201cLilian Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cHow is it, do you bet?\u201dWhy does she have it then?Didn\u2019t she say she didn\u2019t know about the Leas incident?Why does she want to create fakes when she has the real one?For what reason?A lot of questions filled her mind at the unexpected name. Why? Just why?The man smirked.\u201cBelieve it or not. That is your freedom.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was only then that she realized that it been planned. She hurriedly corrected her bewildered expression, but it was already too late.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious if this necklace is real or not? Then arrange a meeting with Psychke Silkisia. I\u2019ll let you know.\u201dHe took out a cigarette with a satisfied expression and told.* * *It was late afternoon when she left the upper building. It was summer, so the sun was long, and it wasn\u2019t dark, but she walked quickly.\u2018Lillian and the real necklace.\u2019Hearing the unexpected words made her head throb. She had to go back and organize her messy thoughts.\u2018I have to go somewhere and release the magic to change my appearance.\u2019She couldn\u2019t go back to Lestir looking like this since the Black Moon knows her appearance of her. So, she tried to take off the magic where there were no people around.By the way,\u2018Who was that?\u2019It wasn\u2019t long before she realized someone was following her. She walked down an alley that was twisted like a spider\u2019s web to see her opponent. She also tried to make her way through a crowd of people.But that gaze never fell. No, it seemed that the person following her increased to two.\u2018I thought he didn\u2019t know.\u2019The man of the black moon. He said he wouldn\u2019t follow her, so she went out with confidence.He was a man who could not be trusted till the end.\u2018I have to deal with him.\u2019The limit of the artifact Verndia gave her was nearing. The 12 hours were almost over, and she couldn\u2019t go on like this. She thought she could handle things within the limited time frame.Pretending she heard her way, she headed off to a deserted place. And she identified the location of the hiding guys. One was a little further away, and one\u2026Was getting closer?If they are tailing her, they have to keep their distance. A moment of bewilderment engulfed her.Tak, an arrow with a black feather pierced under her feet. I don\u2019t think she heard it wrong. It seemed to be like a warning.\u201cDon\u2019t move. Unless you want to die.\u201dA cold but youthful voice. This voice sounded like she heard it somewhere\u2026Psychke turned her head towards the sound. Just when she was trying to find out who shot the arrow, taaak!\u201cOh, they were three?\u201dA kick came out of nowhere. She was wary of anyone approaching, so she blocked it without difficulty. The child who failed the attack tumbled backwards. Beneath the fine-grained black hair, crimson eyes shone with hostility.Upon confirming the other person, Psychke was stunned.\u201cCroa?\u201d\u201cWhat? How do you know my name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Be sure to capture them alive.\u201d\u2018His voice is similar to that of Croa. Then the one who shot the arrow was Crow-\u2018She didn\u2019t even have time to finish her thoughts when two arrows flew, aiming for her arms and legs respectively. In the meantime, Croa ran into her with his bare hands. He hastily pulled his body out. Croa clung tenaciously.\u201cWait, Croa! It\u2019s me, Psychke!\u201d\u201cWho is Psychke?\u201dCroa replied to the flustered Psychke.\u201cThe one who is betrothed to the Duke. Don\u2019t you know anything about that?\u201d\u201cHer name was Psychke? Isn\u2019t she the princess?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s her, given her an honorific name.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. Haha.\u201dThe two crows did not stop their hands even though they were arguing. They were doing it without much effort as if they have done it before.\u201cWait! Stop!\u201dShe was busy blocking her hands and feet, so she couldn\u2019t untie the bracelet at all because of the arrows aiming at her. She could attack at full force, but she was afraid Croa will get hurt.When Psychke kept saying \u2018I am Psyche\u2019, the angry Croa shouted.\u201cThe princess doesn\u2019t look like that! And even when shorter than me!\u201d\u201cTat is because of magic. I\u2019ll show you!\u201d\u201cNo. You will just escape!\u201dRather, Croa thought it was a means of her escape, and every time she reached for her bracelet, Croa attacked more fiercely.\u201cYou even blessed me!\u201dCrow flinched at the word blessing and murmured.\u201c\u2026 Are you really the princess?\u201d\u201cNo. The princess is smaller than I am. He\u2019s probably saying anything because he doesn\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d\u201cThey say I smell like winter!\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Looks like the real Princess.\u201d\u201cDo you know what winter smells like?\u201d\u201cThe smell of winter is the smell of winter.\u201d\u201cLook at that. Why don\u2019t you know what winter smells like? I told you, she\u2019s not really the princess.\u201d\u2026 When did you tell me?It was so frustrating that she couldn\u2019t speak. Whatever she said, he dismissed it as a lie.\u2018The smell of winter doesn\u2019t come out when it\u2019s completely attached.\u2019Nor could she expect to be recognized by her engagement ring or earrings. The engagement ring was a plain gold ring. The earring prevented Hilvia\u2019s misfortune, which rushed to marry her, and cast magic to disable her.\u201cCrow, he\u2019s too strong. Can\u2019t I just kill him?\u201d\u201cNo. The Duke told me to bring him alive unconditionally.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s annoying.\u201dIt was this one that was annoying. She can\u2019t even use a sword because she was afraid they will get hurt.\u2018It\u2019s about time the bracelet\u2019s mana runs out.\u201dAt that moment, Ping, his eyesight turned. The side effects appeared beyond the time limit for using the artifact. Unbearable drowsiness began to pour into his mind. She felt groggy in the middle of the fight and his eyes were closed. The arrows that took advantage of the staggering gap scratched her cheeks and arms.\u201c\u2026 Uh, the smell of winter?\u201dCroa sniffed at the blood that shone from her wound. Even so, his final kick did not stop.\u201cThe smell of winter?\u201dIt was the last time she heard Crow\u2019s frightened voice in her frightened mind. Psychke, who was kicked, passed out inevitably.***Returning to the mansion, Verndia couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.\u201cAh, what to do? Princess, open your eyes. Why don\u2019t you wake up already? Are you dead?\u201d\u201cShe is breathing. Shake her more. We have to wake her up before Master arrives.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when it was reported that she had gone out yet haven\u2019t returned, he confirmed her whereabouts with the ring.\u2018She\u2019s in the basement?\u2019Maybe the reason she was there because that was the place he used to catch bad guys?\u201c\u2026\u2026What are they doing?\u201dSeeing her limp, surrounded by his crows, his spirits plummeted. A terrifying purple aura bloomed all over his body.His purple flame sparkled and crackled.\u201cGasp.\u201d\u201cHiccup.\u201dThe crows, who made a fainting impression, stood upon noticing his attention.

Here and there were located bruises and some wounds that blood dripped from.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe crows were terrified by the nearing death that seemed to be oppressive.\u201cI only fought with her using my bare hands.\u201d\u201cCroa said that if we can\u2019t catch her, we will kill her instead.\u201d\u201cI did it because we were in a hurry.\u201d\u201cWhen did you? You never did.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt her but Croa kept telling me to do so.\u201d\u201cI never did!\u201d\u201cI thought she was the Princess. But Croa threatened me, so I couldn\u2019t help it. All of this is Croa\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cHey! Crow! It was your job from the start! You asked for my help!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stab me!

Even then, Psychke had not woken up. Despite wearing the brooch, he gave, she didn\u2019t get smaller.The side effect of using the broach for more than 12 hours was absolute sleep. As falling into a sleep from which one could not wake up, or one could wake up only after sleeping twice the time limit passed.* * *Fluttering.The regular sound of paper turning was heard.Psychke opened both of her eyes.\u2018\u2026 What is this place?\u2019There was a strange ceiling from above.She was not staying in the guest room, incomparable to her room, this one was elegant, sophisticated, and well-groomed just like an office.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dHearing that sound directly near her, she jumped up. A familiar blanket, no, actually a handkerchief fell from her body, and the brooch was removed making her body smaller.\u201cYou should sleep more.\u201dA long finger pressed her forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dOh oh oh, while he was doing that, her head touched the pillow. Her eyes narrowed at the soft touch she felt and upon waking up, she rubbed her eyes and looked at him.\u201cDuke?\u201d\u201cI heard what happened. The Crows said they attacked without knowing that you were the Princess.\u201dIt was absurd to think about it again. He let out a long breath.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you feeling well? The doctor said you weren\u2019t seriously hurt.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since your body got bigger and you already got out\u2026. Please drink some. You always get hurt every day.\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t have given her the brooch then that way, she wouldn\u2019t have gone out. Verndia grumbled annoyedly and flipped what he was looking at.She was awake and her head was blank. She struggled to lift her eyelids which were about to close. She followed the sound of paper fluttering with her eyes.Then she discovered something strange. Mirror?No, that\u2019s-\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was a portrait of herself that Verndia had taken to her office when she was wearing doll\u2019s dress.Her sleepiness went away, and she was jolted awake.She jumped up and furiously pushed the frame of her portrait off his desk.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dBut before her hand could reach her, Verndia lifted her portrait. She reached out her hand and even tiptoed, trying to snatch it somehow. Her face flushed hot as if she was about to explode.\u201cWhy do you still have it?\u201d\u201cTo see and laugh when I\u2019m depressed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you something else to make you laugh, so throw it away!\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dVerndia smiled and placed her picture frame on his windowsill. It was out of her reach.\u201cCome to think of it, I forgot to put on the bell on you. Princess, that cherry-like\u2014\u201c\u201cNo, I do not want to!\u201d\u201c\u2026. Hmm.\u201dHe made a sad face.\u201cLooking at it like that, the frame doesn\u2019t break, so you should get some more sleep. Aren\u2019t you sleepy? The artifact must make you sleepy.\u201d\u201cI am not sleepy.\u201dHe forced her eyes away from her portrait and bowed her head. She thought he had abandoned it a long time ago. She was embarrassed and couldn\u2019t lift her face. Her sleep was also gone.\u201cThen let\u2019s come and see this together.\u201dTak, tak, tak.There were small footsteps. She stood in front of the papers, trying as possible to see him.Verndia corrected her holding posture so that she could see it better.\u201cThis\u2026 Silkisia\u2019s family tree? Why is this\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause of job. You have memorized the family tree, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTell me if there is anything wrong.\u201dFlutter, flutter.For a while, the office was filled with only the sound of paper being turned. In the last chapter, after confirming the names of Logan Silkisia and his children, Psychke opened her mouth.\u201cAll is correct.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dVerndia tapped his desk like he was playing the piano.\u201cI\u2019ve definitely wiped out the records of Silkisia. In that case-\u201dHe muttered something into his mouth and folded his fingers and after that, his purple eyes reached Psychke.\u201cI want to ask the Princess about four questions. I want her to answer without hiding anything but If you don\u2019t like it, say no. Don\u2019t lie.\u201dWhat question are those?His expression was so serious that she became very nervous. Straightening her back, she nodded her head.\u201cQuestion number one. Name before adoption. Do you remember?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Psychke, was it?\u201d\u201cYes. It was made by my father.\u201d\u201cDo you remember anything? Only a part is fine.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 no.\u201d\u201cHmm. Why can\u2019t you remember, too?\u201dVerndia narrowed his brows with those meaningful words.\u201cNext question. Why did you go to the craft shop and the black moon?\u201d\u201cThat.\u201dHow should she organize it? It was a long story, so she couldn\u2019t answer right away and hesitated. Mistaking that hesitation for not wanting to talk, she put something on Verndia\u2019s desk.It was the Emerald that Psychke stole from the craft shop. It was not that he didn\u2019t search her body that could hurt her, but he just gently rolls her body while taking care of her.\u201cI knew that Princess Lillian was making her necklace.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPsychke was startled. How?Did Miss Lia commission him to investigate this, just like the auction house?\u201cI was going to wait until the right time and attack. When the Princess is involved, things get complicated. Why did you go?\u201d\u201cI am also investigating the Leas case.\u201d\u201cThe Princess does? Why?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, Aiden said I was a victim of the Leas case. I wanted to know what that meant.\u201dThat is because unable to unveil the truth will be the death of her. To explain this, she had to explain her regression, so she answered with an additional reason.\u201cTsk.\u201dVerndia clicked his tongue. It was a good sign that she took an interest in the case herself. Maybe even after she knows everything, her memory will be fine.However, it was Aiden who brought about this change in her, so he hated it. He should have done that first.He grunted.\u201cSo, what did you find out?\u201d\u201cThe real Keitan\u2019s necklace is said to be in Lillian\u2019s possession.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cHe said that he would let me know when I visit the guild with the Duke.\u201d\u201cDid you believe that?\u201d\u201cNo. But I think it\u2019s worth going.\u201dVerndia touched his mouth. Lillian Silkisia and the real thing. This was an unexpected combination. Sometimes the unexpected turns out to be the answer. As the Princess said, she deserved to be recognized.\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll talk about that later. Third. What did you talk about with Widnix? I\u2019m not here to help.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201dPsychke averted her gaze. It was a story related to her regression, so she couldn\u2019t tell him everything that easily now that nothing has been resolved. Even if she tells that, he won\u2019t believe it, anyways. Since she was looking the other way, she didn\u2019t see Verndia\u2019s face harden.\u201cEastern East after the breakup\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cheat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNot even that.\u201d\u201cCan you give me a hint?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVerndia looked like a person who had lost his country.\u201cHe didn\u2019t gossip about the duke. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d\u201cWhat about the last question?\u201dShe felt sorry for continuing to refuse to answer him so Psychke changed the subject. It wasn\u2019t polite to pry someone who didn\u2019t like it. And he said she could refuse if she doesn\u2019t want. She doesn\u2019t want to, but what can he do? He sighed and touched his face dry to let go of his lingering feelings.And he spoke in a hard tone like a soldier on the verge of going to war.\u201cAre you free tomorrow? No, even if you are not, you should be. Because it\u2019s important.\u201dIt\u2019s like trying to prove something important. Among the previous questions, the expression on his face now was the most serious she had ever seen.Suddenly, her body stiffened. Did something big awaits her?\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\u201cDate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026? Yes?\u201dShe got embarrassed because she thought she misheard it. What date is he talking about? It may be out of the blue, but why is he saying that with such an expression?Blinking his eyes, she asked again, and he answered with an uncharacteristic seriousness.\u201cI have something to confess to the princess.\u201d(TN: \u2026 OH? Confession? Hmm\u2026 Interesting\u2026 )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Princess! You\u2019re so pretty!\u201dCecile, who was adjusting the hem of her light blue dress from below, squealed.She tried to do her makeup moderately, yet she was drawn by what Cecile said and looked in the mirror. Looking at herself in the mirror was neither flashy or plain, just right. She looked the same as usual, but it felt something was different somehow, even Cecile told her that she looked prettier than usual\u2026.\u2018It\u2019s awkward.\u2019Melissa always dressed her up fancily, but it looked more awkward.She tilted her head to clear her awkwardness. The woman in the mirror also tilted her head. Her blue cross earrings drooped at an angle.\u201cThe Duke will also say you\u2019re pretty absolutely!\u201d\u201cThe Duke said doesn\u2019t like me even when I was dressed more fancy than this.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026. But, but, the duke doesn\u2019t like flashy things!\u201dCecile finished her grooming by inserting the brooch-shaped artifact she was holding onto her chest. Cecil clenched her fists.\u201cDo not worry. If he says otherwise, I will scold him!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t you going to get fired if you do that?\u201dFortunately, Cecile was never fired.Verndia, seeing her like that, said,\u201cShall we not go out?\u201dEven though he is already handsome, he dressed up himself exceptionally well today and Psychke, who was mesmerized by his beauty by that sparkling and shining light from afar, was surprised upon seeing him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cJust the thought of it makes me a little\u2026 annoyed.\u201d\u201c.. Do I look that bad?\u201dShe thought she would look fine because Cecile was so confident, but does she look so bad that he didn\u2019t want to go out together with her?Her face hardened and the bewildered Verndia tried hard to say his excuse.\u201cThat\u2019s not it, princess!\u201dCecile saw that the two going out, refuted his words. On the other hand, Isolet took advantage of the gap and understood Verndia\u2019s language. He felt that he was the one protecting their relationship, that ugly snout.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take the Duke\u2019s words as they are. The Princess is so pretty that other men will stare at you, that\u2019 why the Duke is annoyed\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dThe red-eared Verndia cut him off. But the important content was behind everyone. He almost hugged the distraught Psychke and put her in the carriage.***Clack, Clack, Clack.In the subdued silence, only the regular sound of horses\u2019 hooves filled the space. She couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open.She was embarrassed, awkward, ashamed.Psychke bowed her head, and she fidgeted with her fingernails.And her face was slightly red.Verndia, whose ear color had returned to normal, was pretending to leisurely look out the window with his arms crossed. Then, wanting to say something to lighten the mood, he feigned composure and opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in case you misunderstand. I\u2019m not that you look bad.\u201dPsychke\u2019s pupils toward the floor trembled as if an earthquake had struck.\u201cI\u2019m usually annoyed, but today it\u2019s a little more so\u2026 Damn it.\u201dWhy is he explaining this?Verndia touched his forehead. Again, the word tender was far from him. Clearing his expression, he went straight to the point.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal that I\u2019m going to confess, it just happened yesterday in the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dShe was happy to change the subject. Psychke looked at her knees.\u201cThere is ordinary news, mediocre news, and bad news. What do you want to hear?\u201dShe reflexively raised her eyes. Then she averted her gaze from his purple eyes that contained her face and figure. Her face, which had barely calmed down, was about to heat up again. She wanted to calm her pounding heart, so she chose the least irritating thing.\u201cPlease start with the ordinary news.\u201d\u201cI said in front of His Majesty that I have no intention of breaking off the marriage with the Princess.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHer heartbeat couldn\u2019t stop beating abnormally and her eyes fell to the floor. Psychke immediately raised her eyes.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThen, here is the bad news.\u201dEven though she couldn\u2019t say anything else, Verndia, who crinkled his locking brow, quickly jolted the next.\u201cPrincess was almost sold out to the Empire of Hestie.\u201dPsychke\u2019s face hardened.\u2018Why me there?\u2019Prior to her regression, she had never been proposed to in Hestie. She didn\u2019t do anything in this life that she could relate to.\u201cFinally, the mediocre news is an oracle.\u201dVerndia simplifies the stories of \u2018Glory that has lost its light\u2019 and \u2018A flower bloomed by silence\u2019. But he didn\u2019t say that one of them seemed to relate to thee.She decided that there was no need to create unnecessary anxiety by letting her know something she wasn\u2019t sure about.\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d\u201cWhy did Hestie say they wanted me?\u201d\u201cThey said he wanted to have a deep relationship through marriage. I haven\u2019t heard anything other than that.\u201d\u201cDid His Majesty speak directly?\u201dEven thinking about it again, she was dumbfounded, so Verndia involuntarily nodded his head.A look of bewilderment crept over Psychke\u2019s face.\u201cSilkisia can\u2019t go where snow falls. Didn\u2019t your father tell you?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything like that. More importantly, Snow?\u201d\u201cYes. Ah, this is a family secret. Please don\u2019t tell others. Silkisia has such a phobia that they can\u2019t even move if we go near snows. Else, they\u2019ll go mad.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression became strange. He chuckled silently, licking his dry lips with his tongue.\u201cPrincess, are you scared of snows?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I always stayed in the southern manor in winter. Because it doesn\u2019t snow in the South.\u201d\u201cThe Duke of Silkisia and his two sons got around just fine even in the heavy snow?\u201d\u201cThey are not afraid of the snow.\u201d\u201cI heard that Silkisia has a snow phobia?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dRealizing the contradiction, Psychke was greatly perplexed. Currently, no one in Silkisia is afraid of snow. Then how did she know that Silkisia was afraid of snows?Verndia asked calmly.\u201cHow did you know that Silkisia had a snow phobia?\u201d\u201cThat-\u201dPsychke was speechless.It seemed that she heard it from someone else.Who was it, then?No matter how hard she tried, no one came to her mind as if that person disappeared in her memory. Verndia broke her confusion, adding,\u201cI guess Logan didn\u2019t know because he didn\u2019t say it. Princess, you\u2019re an adoptee. How did you know something that even no one in Silkisia knows?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHer blue eyes twitched widely. How did she know this?She said nothing but munched her lips. And then,\u201cUgh.\u201dShe suddenly grabbed her head and bent her body. She squeezed her eyes shut and let out a painful moan.\u2018Did she remember something?\u2019Previously, up to this extent, she would have been fainted and she had been holding out for some quite time. In case she fainted, Verndia prepared to accept it.It was then.Black sparks flew from Psychke. There was also the sound of breaking, something breaking. Unable to keep her balance, she stumbled and fell helplessly.\u201cPrincess!\u201dVerndia was stunned and hurriedly embraced her. He thought she would faint again so he gently touched her cheek. The quivering eyelids fluttered open.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why me?\u201dThe hazy look seemed to have just woken up from sleep. Why was she being embraced by the Duke again?\u2018Did I fail again?\u2019She had a different reaction. She asked him urgently, while embracing her as she tried to escape.\u201cHow far do you remember our conversation?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of the snow, and even that I\u2019m an adopted child?\u201d\u201cDo you remember when Logan and the two Princes said they weren\u2019t afraid of the snow?\u201d\u201cYes. I do remember everything. Sorry. I must have fallen asleep.\u201dNo way.Was that spark created when the magic was destroyed? It is forbidden to make hasty judgments. He definitely needed to check it out.He then blurted bluntly.\u201cThe princess is the daughter of Leas.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dShe was taken aback by what he said out of the blue and Verndia reasoned step by step.\u201c\u2026. That.\u201dPsychke, who had been listening quietly, answered. She was clutching her head, her face distorted, for as she listened to him, she felt her terrible headache.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I heard that all of the former Silkisia died 20 years ago\u2026.Ugh.\u201dShe didn\u2019t faint but she was in so much pain, feeling like she couldn\u2019t push herself together anymore. It seemed that her magic had been broken, but it was not.Verndia shut his mouth.Apparently, her magic loosens when she felt herself detached.There is a way, a gap, and all he has to do is induce. He decided to lead Psychke to the correct answer step by step.\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s assume that we don\u2019t know how you got to know Silkisia\u2019s secret. Then why does it seem that the secret lies with the princess?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a coincidence.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s common to have severe ocular phobia that you can\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cYes, but it makes more sense than me being the real Silkisia.\u201d\u201cI wonder if it has something to do with the Princess\u2019s ability but think about it carefully. Why do you think the princess has an ability that has been passed down from generation to generation in Silkisia?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes were not focused.She then regained her senses after a while.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dVerndia gritted his teeth. Can\u2019t she completely break the spell just by feeling detached from herself?What should she do?He was in the midst of thinking.After alleviating her headache, Psychke opened her mouth.\u201cI thought of you when you said it was a supernatural ability, Duke. You said you wouldn\u2019t break off our marriage in front of the Emperor?\u201cYes, I did. Because as soon as we breaks our marriage, he intends to send the Princess to Hestie.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke\u2019s face turned white. And Verndia, who saw that, mistakenly thought that her paleness was due to something else.\u201cHa.\u201dShe exhaled her cold breath and half-raised her body. Psychke suddenly looked up at him.His chin, his large hands, touched the wall behind her. His face came closer. A rough breath felt at the tip of her nose.\u201cWhy, are you worried that I won\u2019t let you go? Are you afraid you will be forced like what Silkysia did?\u201dWhy?Why does his face look scarred?And why does she feel these emotions through the ring?Verndia said bitterly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will definitely break off the marriage as you wish. I\u2019ll put you where no one can find you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201dPsychke cut him off. Everything he said was wrong, but that wasn\u2019t why she asked about their breakup.(TN: Haaaaaaaaaaaaa, these two are frustrating as fre\u2026 if I have a power, I\u2019d likely want to punch these two so hard.)Suppressing her thumping heart, she opened her mouth.\u201cI heard from Duke Evergreen.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201dVerndia answered pointedly. Psychke, who was about to speak without hesitation, flinched while looking at him. She looked into his purple eyes and cautiously parted her lips.\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t kill me no matter what I say.\u201d\u201cThose words again? Haa. I will never kill you. I will protect you no matter what. Didn\u2019t I already promise?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different this time. You might listen to me and change your mind.\u201d\u201cWhy, did Widnix say I want to kill you?\u201dPsychke avoided his gaze. She gently bit her lower lip, gripping the hem of her fine skirt tight enough to leave a mark.Verndia laughed. He took a seat next to her. He crossed his arms and legs to hear what she wants to say.\u201cTell me, I think I have a rough idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026. The unquenchable flame that won\u2019t go out. If you say it was because me, that was it.\u201dAs soon as the faintly trembling voice stopped, Verndia asked back.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo then?\u201dShe was surprised by what he meant so she raised her gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t you know what that means?\u201d\u201cThe princess will kill me, what, is this what that means?\u201dPsychke frowned at him. It was as if those words that had no place had become sharp blades and pierced her heart.She wished she could be angry, astonished, or at least surprised. Then her heart wouldn\u2019t be so heavy like this. It would be a little lighter.Burying himself in his seat, he asked casually.\u201cPrincess, have you ever been to the East?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Yes. I have been there once with my father.\u201d\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter if I just burn it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe words she heard from him passed by at first glance.\u2018Because if I heard some b*lls*ht once again, I\u2019ll burn the East Coast.\u2019Verndia smiled eerily.\u201cI will do as I say.\u201d\u201cNo, wait!\u201dPsychke was shocked.\u201cDuke Evergreen said this because he was thinking of you.\u201d\u201cDo you believe in Widnix?\u201dDoes she believe in Widnix?Believing.Because he knew the world before her regression. Because he knew the past when she was trapped in Silkisia and died lonely.After reading her expression, Verndia let out a sigh.\u201cWidnix is not a prophet.\u201cBut.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to say, but\u2026\u201dHe stopped talking and tilted his head as if he really didn\u2019t know.\u201cYou\u2019re not asking me to kill you, are you?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dPsychke said nothing in return. The best way to get rid of a threat is to kill it. So, if she kept on pushing this topic, there was only one conclusion.But even knowing that, she couldn\u2019t stop.Verndia laughed mischievously at the deepening depth.\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me? Widnix is not a prophet.\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he said, so I don\u2019t even believe him.\u201dHe told Widnix not to say nonsensical thing, but he did that s**t again. He let out a deep breath.\u201cWidnix can\u2019t see the future. He knows the past better than anyone.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t retort to anything he says since she has no idea what he did after her death. However, even when she couldn\u2019t speak, Verndia continued,\u201cHe is always like that. He speaks bullsh*t as if he knows everything about being a coward.\u201d\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cAnything.\u201d\u201cIf I die, what will the Duke do?\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression disappeared. For a moment, Psychke even had the illusion that what was in front of her was not a person. A chill went down her spine.\u2013 Hhhnggg!The horses outside sensed the ominous and made a fuss. Even the coachman trembled and muttered that it was creepy for some reason.By the time the sound goes quiet. He voiced out so low that only she could hear him.\u201cDid that bastard say that?\u201dIt was indescribably ominous. Psychke hastily denied it.\u201cNo. I just asked.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll be honest. I think there is a connection between my death and the saying that the unquenchable flame is extinguished because of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe spoke as honestly as she could. She was scared that doing nothing will be the end of East Coast.Having reaped her life, she lowered her gaze.He covered her mouth and thought.He thought deeply about why the princess said such a thing and what bullsh*t Widnix told her about. Without thinking for a long time, he came up with something.\u2018He must have used his authority\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll have to talk to Widnix.\u2019Quickly organizing his thoughts, he raised his head. Even then, Psychke\u2019s complexion was dark. She worries over useless thing. In an attempt to relieve the tension, he made an erratic sound.\u201cWhy, if a princess dies, do you think I\u2019ll follow her?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cWell, come to think of it, that\u2019s not too bad.\u201dHe pokes her cheek playfully. It was soft as when she was small.He wanted to touch it more, so he rubbed it gently. Redness spread from the place where his fingers touched, like paint smeared on a paper. Embarrassed, Psychke threw her body back.\u201cWh, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to die. So don\u2019t be so desperate and smile. Don\u2019t worry about weird things.\u201dHe locked her against the wall as she tried to escape. He tucked her hair from her pale cheeks behind her ears. Then, the blue eyes that had lost their way and wandered turned to him.The closer face looked like a puzzled rabbit. She looked very cute, too.\u201cMo\u2026. Ve, please.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dWatching that she kept on averting her eyes with her face flushed, from him, he suddenly wanted to ask her.\u2018At that time, she said that she would have no feelings for me from now on. What should I do if I can\u2019t keep it?\u2019But before putting that idea into reality, the sound of arriving at today\u2019s destination, the swordsmanship competition hall, echoed inside the wagon.Intermittent cheers could be heard echoing from inside the arena. Unfortunately, time is not limited to today.\u201cShall we go?\u201dHe smiled and held out his arm.* * *The seat the attendant guided was the seat of honor. The field of view is wide open, she can see the stadium at a glance, and it was close enough that she can even see the expressions of the judges.Psychke, who was sitting down, opened her mouth with a question that suddenly came to mind.\u201cI have something I want to ask you about Duke Evergreen.\u201d\u201cAre you really thinking of another man on a date with me?\u201dHe thought it was over. He also grumbled to mean that she should stop focusing at Widnix\u2019s tirade.Yes, she could ask later, but for now, she should stop. Let\u2019s just focus on the present.Psychke apologized plainly.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cYou are not allowed to think of other man when you are with me. No, even when you are alone, do not think.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what he was feeling, so she apologized. He liked her cool answer. Verndia leaned against her slightly.Because they were so attached to each other when she was still small, Psychke did not feel a sense of incongruity.\u201cAre you not uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay.\u201dWhat Verndia asked was \u2018Am I uncomfortable?\u2019, and Psychke\u2019s reply was \u2018This posture is fine\u2019.It passed anyway. If it was uncomfortable, she would have run away. Verndia smiled wider, leaning more towards her.Then he saw a finger pointed at Psychke.\u201cOh, look over there. She is Princess Psychke. And next to her\u2014\u201d\u201cI heard that they fought enough to burst an alleyway, but what is this?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they only pretending to look good? There\u2019s nothing good about showing off bad things in a place like this.\u201d\u201cWell, it was like that at the fountain too. The Duke must be having a hard time too. Every time I look at the,, Princess Lillian suits him much better.\u201dInstantly, his good mood went downhill.How dare they say something like that when they can see how Psychke was pretty!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you allowing them to insult you like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m used to it. I am okay.\u201dShe wanted to be this kind.Next time, she will surely do things without asking her. He dropped the topic and said another thing.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you will misunderstand again, but I didn\u2019t come to a crowded place just to put an end to rumors of discord. You know?\u201dAs Psychke was about to answer, the voice of the host, whose voice had been raised by magic, resounded. Verndia muttered without erasing his smile.\u201cThe match is about to begin.\u201d (The host.)\u201cYes, I know.\u201dIn line with that sound, two masked swordsmen appeared from both ends of the arena.Psychke was appalled.The place where they are now was a swordsmanship competition held informally for a week to commemorate the prince\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony.They wore the same armor and clothes. Verndia told her before they left and he explained it t o her again one more time.And today was the last day of the week, starting with the quarter finals.\u201cSince it is a tournament where there is no distinction between nobles and commoners, they covered their faces so that they could fight without being intimidated. If so, just looking at the scabbard would reveal everything.\u201dIt was a gift from Verndia for Psychke, who likes swords. Unlike her high competition rate, it was not difficult to obtain tickets.\u201cIt seems that everyone uses the same sword.\u201d\u201cSir Isolet must have suffered.\u201d.\u201cMy money was the one that suffered. Don\u2019t think of other men.\u201d\u201cBecause of those who said that you can only show your skills by fighting with what you are familiar with. Isn\u2019t it obvious, if you don\u2019t want to talk behind your back, just abstain on your own.\u201d\u201cAs you said, everyone is wearing a mask.\u201dVerndia tutted.\u201cThe eight people who will come out today are all nobles. Just by looking at the decorations on the sword, you can tell which family it belongs to. Even the Princess will know some of them.\u201dThe first fight ended abruptly and the second was no different.Only those who were ignorant of swordsmanship were enthusiastic, but the arena was strangely rigid.\u201cI knew it would be like this. The third will be different, though.\u201dIt was as he said.\u201cThese are two swordsmen who excelled in every match!\u201dThe one on the left was a blonde man wearing a white mask. The one on the right was a black-haired man wearing a black mask. With that words, two masked swordsmen appeared from both ends of the arena. Unlike the previous match, where they checked the scabbard first, the two were only staring at each other\u2019s faces.They wore the same armor and clothes. The swordsman, who saw the opponent\u2019s splendid scabbard, withdrew shortly thereafter. The shape of the knife was oddly familiar.Psychke couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the two of them.\u2018Perhaps?\u2019Still, Psychke, who had hoped for it just in case, was lost in daze.And that doubt turned to certainty when she saw the two men\u2019s swords.It was Aiden and Yzhar.* * *Yzhar took the lead of the match.Kang!A distinct metal grinding sound resonated.Gradually, Aiden swung his the sword and dug inward. Yzhar flinched and distanced himself, as if he didn\u2019t expect his opponent to fight with him despite knowing his identiity.\u201cAre you going to fight? Come on?\u201dHe asked in a low voice, as if interrogating, but Aiden swung his sword without saying a word. It meant that he would not back down. Yzhhar, who was displeased with his action, dealt with him with a pained sound.Just like that, several sums of pressure come and go.Psychke, who was going through their matches as if analyzing them, opened her eyes wide.\u2018How?\u2019She was surprised in two ways. The first was that the match, which looked like it would end soon, was going on for like eternity.Without a doubt, she doubt that Yzhar would win and that Aiden will struggle, but the opposite happened. Yzhar was the one struggling.\u201cD*mn.\u201dHis swear words reached the audience. Regardless of this, Aiden fiercely pushed him.\u2018They were the same.\u2019It was because the swordsmanship of the person she met in the labyrinth and Yzhar\u2019s swordsmanship were the same. Similar to but not \u00a0to Silkisia, it pursues only extreme destruction without considering the body of the swordsman it uses.It was not destructive because it attracted a lot of people\u2019s attention, but it was clearly visible in Psychke\u2019s eyes. That was the same swordsmanship. And the moment she realized that, Psychke knew why Yzhar was being pushed by Aiden.\u2018The core of that swordsmanship is its destructive power.\u2019Killing was forbidden in this competition.It was a sword trick to destroy something, but since the core was removed, it had to be pushed back.\u2018Since when did he change like that?\u2019The last sparring with Yzhar was a year ago. After that, she couldn\u2019t see his swordsmanship because she was kicked out like a stray cat, saying not to enter the gymnasium.\u2018He changed that much in just one year?\u201dIs such a thing possible?She couldn\u2019t believe it even though she saw it with both of her eyes.Then, in the battle in the labyrinth that suddenly emerged, something suddenly cut off in her head. The hostility that was severe enough to pierce the skin.He wanted to kill her.So, maybe that was the reason why his swordsmanship changed so much\u2026In an instant, she met the black eyes behind the mask head-on. There was life in her eyes, which had only been insensitive.Kang-!\u201cKuk!\u201dThe sound of metal being cut pierced the air. His armor was cut and his skin was chapped. Red blood dripped from Aiden, who was unable to avoid the attack from his opponent.It was a lethal move.\u201cAaaaacccckkkk!!!\u201d\u201cBl, blood!\u201dEven if it was a swordsmanship match, the match so far had been bland, so some feeble-minded nobles screamed and collapsed. They wanted to watch a swordsmanship match, but afraid of blood, so it was all the more so because the majority of those who came after hearing that the killing was banned.The embarrassed host cut off the proceedings.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a break for a while!\u201dThe priest and doctor who had been waiting in advance rushed to Aiden, who was kneeling and clutching his waist. In the corner of the stadium, discussions began about whether to continue this match or whether to disqualify.However, Yzhar, who heard the exclamation, did not move. He looked only at Psychke with cold eyes.She couldn\u2019t find any sense of affection from his eyes, as if he was her enemy.Psychke didn\u2019t look away from his gaze.Even though she bit her lower lip until it turned white, she didn\u2019t budge. She put all her strength in her hand holding the handle of her chair and glared at him with sad eyes.Right around that time, the host who was talking to Aiden voiced out with embarrassment.\u201cYes? Are you sure you still want to continue?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter finishing the treatment, Aiden stood up. He denied the host\u2019s words that it is alright to end this match.Aiden\u2019s red eyes fell to Psychke\u2019s hardened face and said.\u201cI will continue.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a temporary treatment, so the wound may burst.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dTherefore, the match resumed.The host announced that even if Yzhar won, he would not be able to fight to the semi-finals.\u201cTsk.\u201dYzhar, exuding genuine disgust, turned his back on Psychke. Judging from the emotion in his voice, it seemed that he was embarrassed that he did not advance to the semi-finals.Psychke recalled the privilege given to the winner of the contest.\u2018In commemoration of the victory, it was said he could make a wish to the head of Ikaxia or Adenthal.\u2019What kind of wish did he borrow that a man as much as Ikaxia\u2019s vice president participated in the game?She couldn\u2019t tell.There were some precarious situations, but not enough to affect the win or loss. Aiden beat Yzhar.Yzhar\u2019s swordsmanship, which had significantly reduced destructive power, was lacking somewhere, just like at the beginning of the match.\u201cMurderer!\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201dAs Yzhar returned to the waiting room, accusations and verbal abuse poured into his ears.It was the work of people who sat too far away to guess his identity.She was looking at Yzhar\u2019s back as he entered after the game, when she heard a woman\u2019s annoyed voice.\u201cAh, really. Is there anything going on?\u201dIt was the voice she heard in the alleyways and doll kingdom events.As she reflexively looked back toward the exit, through the undulating crowd, her pink hair fluttered for a moment before disappearing.\u2018Shiona?\u2019Are they couple because they were together even in \u00a0the doll kingdom?Whatever happened, what does it matter?Psychke turned her head towards the arena. He had already entered, and Yzhar was nowhere to be seen.She jumped up from her seat.Then, in her astonishment, Verndia looked up at her in confusion.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cThe waiting room.\u201dShe didn\u2019t explain further, and Verndia didn\u2019t ask.He also saw the brother and sister\u2019s snowball fight, so he just stood up and followed.* * *\u201cEducate your children right!\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dJjaak, the sound of a cheek being slapped echoed through the waiting room.Those who lost left, and those who won went out to check the skills of the next opponent, so there were few people in the room. Just in time, an unlucky man passed by.She was startled and pretended not to see that, but she ran into that warm blue eyes.\u201cWhat you looking at? Not going to get lost?\u201dLenox, who slapped the cheek of a man about his father\u2019s age, growled.The old man hastily disappeared.Yzhar remembered the family name of the escaped swordsman. He was thinking of burying him to keep his mouth shut. Then, casually, he rebuked his younger brother.\u201cStop it, Lenox.\u201d\u201cIf you knew it was your brother, you should crawl on your own. Do you know what happened to your brother because of that Aiden son of a b*tch?\u201d\u201cI told you to stop.\u201dLenox, who doesn\u2019t know how scary people could be but he know how Yzhar could be scary so he stopped his hand.Baron Hillace, whose face was red with handprints, bent over.\u201cI am a sinner for not being able to take care of my children. I will definitely teach him today.\u201d\u201cShall we lend the enlisted men?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s my family business, so I\u2019ll handle it on my own.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dYzhar stopped asking him. In fact, he couldn\u2019t afford to care about Aiden or the like.Rather than that, the adopted child who looked at him with cheeky eyes took precedence.\u2018She must have laughed at me.\u2019She must be feeling that he looked pathetic after losing to a guy like that. She was probably laughing at him saying he was not worth dealing with.How did it happen like this?Her place is below me, not above me!Even if it\u2019s fiction, not truth, she has to lower her back and bow at me!Why, why?!\u201cOlder Brother.\u201dThe thought that had fallen to the endless floor was suddenly cut off.He raised his head.His younger brother, who always stood in his way, stood tall in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He nodded his head towards Psychke that means he agreed.\u201cOlder brother!\u201dLenox, who had been left behind with Verndia, was surprised. He hid behind Yzhar, trembling as soon as Psychke appeared.\u201cGo with Baron Hillace over there.\u201d\u201cBr, brother.\u201d\u201cIf anyone sees you, they\u2019ll they you\u2019re a food, catch and eat you.\u201dVerndia was sarcastic at the two. He didn\u2019t even try to hide how his lips twitched.He also did not like being left with Lenox and Baron Hillace.But what can he do if Psychke wanted that?\u201cCall me if necessary.\u201dHe kissed the back of Psychke\u2019s hand out of respect and smiled at Lenox.It was a goofy smile shot at him.\u201cDuke, I think we had something to talk about.\u201d\u201cWell, there is no such thing.\u201d\u201cI am saying I have.\u201dVerndia left, saying it would be no fun to run away. He hasn\u2019t looked at the stiff Baron Hillace since he appeared.\u201cOlder brother\u2026\u201dLenox looked at his brother with his fearful eyes but Yzhar didn\u2019t look at him.Lenox was helpless and moved towards where Verndia was heading for. Their shuffling footsteps filled the silence.\u201cThe baron might as well go.\u201dBaron Hillace looked at Psychke, couldn\u2019t comprehend what she meant. Inevitably, he turned his head and went on his way. Finally, only the two of them were left and Psychke was the first to speak.\u201cDid you really want to kill me?\u201dA low voice trembled.He grumbled out of misery.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201dYzhar, who was still wearing the mask of being a kind brother, crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes as if he doesn\u2019t have any idea of what she was saying.\u201cYou must have had a nightmare because your bedroom changed. It seems that Duke Lestir doesn\u2019t even take care of you well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if your injured area is well.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern, but as you can see, there are no injuries. Losing a match doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets hurt.\u201d\u201cStop the disgusting play.\u201dPsychke coldly cut him. Her clenched fists trembled in ager.Her voice was more subdued than usual.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me straight?\u201dShe hated those 18 years since she hated Yzhar, so as Yzhar hated her.She hated him for everything. For being cold to her without any reason, and even ignoring her with contempt. But if one asks if her loathe for him was enough to kill him, it was not.In any case, he was her brother. He was still a person whom she sees and lives for ten years.\u201cI hate you, that I want you disappear from my sight. And you did.\u201dWhether she was used by her father or not, half of her life was for her Yzhar. He cheated using her skills, using her as his stepping tool. And she naively crawled on being used, saying that it was fine to take all of those things.She hugged her bruised heart and forcibly swallowed it. But was this the end?\u201cThen I would have disappeared.\u201dShe once had such a thought. If Lillian hadn\u2019t come back, she wouldn\u2019t have died.Her father, brother, and Lenox tricked her to her death. She doesn\u2019t know about Lenox or her father who always hated her the moment the truth was revealed, but Yzhar, who reached out his hand pretentiously, might regret it.He said he had a bit of affection for her\u2026She thought so.\u201cYou should have left sooner.\u201dThe distant 18 years collapsed in an instant.There was nothing left. Really, nothing.\u201cBut my father said not to do that.\u201dThere was no expression on the man\u2019s face after taking off the mask of kindness. He looks empty.\u201cI hated you.\u201dThe sound of the sword being pulled out of the scabbard was repulsive. A cold blade touched the nape of her neck. Something hot flowed down her neckline along with the fear of her neck being sliced.But Psychke did not budge at all. What she did was to stare at him.\u201cSomething that you don\u2019t even know where you came from somehow caught my father\u2019s eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPsychke, Psychke, Psychke. That da*n name Psychke.\u201dYzhar gnashed his teeth.\u201cDo you know how much Father took care of you?\u201d\u201cWhat are you?\u201dPsychke\u2019s eyes trembled at his unexpected words.No way. Her father paid any attention to her though?\u201cThe only thing father looked out for me was during swordsmanship training and even that, since you are superior, he didn\u2019t look for me afterwards.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201dThe blade from his sword pierced her skin.Psychke let out a light moan at the pain she couldn\u2019t ignore. The light sky-blue neck collar was dyed red.\u201cWhy did Father only look at you? Why\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Psychke felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was the same situation with Lillian.He has nothing that he owned and even tried having them with his life, yet he couldn\u2019t have anything at all.He loathed and wanted to kill the person who has what he desperately wanted, saying that Psychke took everything from him.Psychke\u2019s tightly clenched fists, loosened. A bleak wind blew through her empty heart. My heart, which should have been hot, froze cold.\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t for you\u2026 or at least if you were not better than me, then\u2026\u201dYzhar was still grieving and couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak. He was silent for long, and she looked at him, clenching her fists that her body trembled.She didn\u2019t know anything about his situation. Whatever she had been through, he had a more pitiful state. At least he was not deceived by the lie that she was the real one!After a while, she felt a sharp pain in her neck. She was tired of this pain.She looked at him, commanding in a cold tone,\u201cStop, and put the sword away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me anyway.\u201d\u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m doing this because I couldn\u2019t kill you?\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201dShe laughed coldly, feeling the pain in the back of her neck.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you killing me, then?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOlder brother cannot kill me. Because if you kill me in a place like this, Silkisia\u2019s reputation will be ruined. Then the interest of that chestnut-sized father in you will disappear completely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it away. Or else-\u201dWith her eyes down, Psychke gently grabbed the blade of his sword and gave it strength.Surprised by this, Yzhar drew his sword.\u201cYou\u2019ve gone crazy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just do it for you.\u201dPsychke smiled faintly.\u201cGive my regards to your father.\u201dThere was no longer any regrets.She turned her body around.***\u201cPlease, Duke.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s just go.\u201dVerndia threatened Lenox that he will hurt Yzhar after encountering them to the corner along with Psychke. But,\u201cYou want to leave after being hurt like this?\u201d\u201cIf I receive treatment, I will get better soon.\u201dThis was a personal matter, and it was something she had to solve on her own. She didn\u2019t want to borrow his hand.It was a time when he was comforting the person who was struggling to move, a priest was passing nearby.\u201cPriest!\u201dPsychke quickly called him and asked him to heal the wound on her neck.The priest readily accepted, and shortly thereafter, only a long red mark remained where her blood had flowed.She ran her finger over the remaining redness to show that it was not painful.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that I threw my clothes away, but I think I can solve it somehow with the money I have. Therefore-\u201d\u201cWas your heart hurt?\u201dPsychke\u2019s words suddenly cut off.Verndia, who was twisting his eyebrows, raised his hand and wiped the empty space under her eyes. He seemed to be wiping her tears away.\u201cWhile crying.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201cA lie.\u201dBlink, she blinked quickly. Her eyes were not hot, or was her nose was cold after crying. It was him who lied.\u201cI really didn\u2019t cry.\u201dVerndia did not object her words. Instead, he ran his large hands over her eyes, caressed her cheeks, and cupped them.She could feel his calluses because of his training. Her body temperature slightly increased without doing much.\u201cI\u2019m not crying\u2026\u201dHis large hands covered her eyes. Psychke reflexively closed her eyes. It was warm and cozy.The moment she perceived the sensation, her tears silently flowed from her eyes.\u201cUgh.\u201dPsychke was perplexed.\u201cTh, this.\u201dThere was no need to refute. It was because he was holding her in his arms.Her heart skipped a beat at the familiar warmth and smell.It warmed her heart like a huge blanket.\u201cYou know?\u201dVerndia softly whispered as if comforting a crying child.\u201cThe Princess is more sad than happy. More afraid than happy. Unhappy more than happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cEven so, you didn\u2019t cry. Not even once. You never gave a good laugh. You look soulless.\u201dShe tried her emotions not seen by others, but it must be because of her ring in her hand.\u201cWhether you cry or laugh, live by expressing your emotions, Princess. Don\u2019t be sincere only when holding the sword.\u201dAnd her tears poured down.It was the first time she had cried in front of someone since being adopted. Psychke was utterly embarrassed even as she cried. Her heart is so calm, but she was not sad, nor does she felt difficult because of things, or painful, so why do her tears come out?And how did he know she was going to cry?His hand that was wrapped around her waist, tightened.When she flinched, Verndia calmed her down.\u201cStay still. I won\u2019t be able to go out until you let out everything.\u201dHe hugged her tightly as if he knew how much she was crying even without seeing him.Psychke closed her eyes.She gave up on escaping and gave her mind to the unfamiliar emotions flowing like waves within her.A riot arose in her heart.It was as if something had been released from her heavy heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not that her body has gotten smaller but because it is functioning well.\u2018Why did he say it\u2019s cute?\u2019She wanted to ask him but was unable.So, she tried not to turn her head to the side where she could feel his hot gaze.She strained her swollen eyes and looked only in front of her, pretending to concentrate on the match.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an attack but only a fall. How did he not see it?\u201dPsychke decided to keep her mouth shut until her vision returned.And she opened her mouth only when the awards ceremony was in progress.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I couldn\u2019t watch the finals. Judging from the reactions, I think it was great.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dUnlike the enthusiastic crowd shouting the name of the winner, Verndia was rather calm.\u201cIf one can\u2019t win in that kind of competition, they better stop learning swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cAh, Sir Aiden is looking here.\u201dAiden, who was waiting for his award, spotted her and grinned at her. He was not wearing his mask.Since he was far away from their place, Psychke only greeted him with her eyes smile.Verndia was displeased noticing that.\u201cDon\u2019t look at other men.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better not to think about them?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even look at them.\u201dHalf of the world is male, so where does she put her eyes, then?Psychke decided not to ask him anymore, as she seemed to know what the answer would be if she asked.\u201cNext is the winners of this year\u2019s competition.\u201dAfter the 3rd and 2nd prizes were awarded, Aiden went up on the podium according to the host\u2019s guidance.The captains of the two knights, Ikaxia and Adenthal, greeted him politely.Aiden won as stated in the competition and can make wish one or two.Since the one who won in the competition was someone she know, she was excited for him.Psychke did not take her eyes off him throughout the giving of prize.\u201c-So, I will hand over the moment of prize to this year\u2019s winner.\u201dThe host\u2019s lengthy words are over.Finally, at the moment of choice, there was no hesitation. Aiden looked at the leader of Ardenthal.\u201cMy wish is\u2026\u201d* * *It was their last thing to do, a dinner.Since Verndia rented the entire building, they were the only ones in the restaurant.The night view was wonderful, and the soft music was rhythmic.As soon as she saw the food decorated with fresh flowers and gold dust under red lighting, Psychke was amazed. And she stuttered the words she said towards Verndia.\u201cThis is too much.\u201d\u201cToo much when it\u2019s a date after a long time?\u201dHe gently folded the corners of his eyes and as she felt burdened, he added,\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat, the food will be sad. The chef will be sad, and so will my money.\u201d(TN: I mean, I will eat it if she doesn\u2019t want\u2026.)\u201cThank you for this food.\u201dThe moment she hesitantly cut a piece of steak the chef had prepared and put it in her mouth, her blue eyes widened for a moment.\u2018It\u2019s good.\u2019Lestir\u2019s meal was also delicious, but it couldn\u2019t compare to the food here.Because Verndia, who wanted to give her a taste of a imperial luncheon, had specially brought her imperial palace chef.Habitually trying to cut the food on her plate, he paused several times.Seeing the good-looking Psychke, Verndia smiled. It was worth it, even though the Crown Prince told him to wake up.\u201cWhat did you like best about what we saw today?\u201dBesides the swordsmanship competition, they also went to two more places.They went to botanical garden and a zoo that were said to have come from a faraway country.Of course, they didn\u2019t forget to stop by the boutique to change her bloody dress before going there.Psychke told the \u2018Black Flower That hums a Strange Melody When Pressed\u2019 she had seen in the botanical garden.She also didn\u2019t forge the zoo\u2019s \u2018Birds That Dance and Eat When Fed\u2019.\u201cIt was amazing. Oh, but it was a pity I didn\u2019t get to see the finals of the tournament.\u201d\u201cIt was not worth seeing.\u201dHim being stingy with the compliments means that it is worth seeing.Psychke was truly sorry that she didn\u2019t get to see the finals.\u201cIt would have been nice if I had seen Sir Aiden\u2019s match. But I didn\u2019t know that such a wish would come true.\u201d\u201cYou did not?\u201dSurprisingly, Verndia tilted his head.\u201cI thought it would, of course.\u201d\u201cI thought it might be possible to want to become a knight in Ardenthal. He said that he did not agree with the Hillace, so I thought Adenthal would be more suitable than Ikaxia in terms of faction.\u201dHowever, while doing so, Psychke spaced it out for a while.\u201cIt was a bit unexpected that he asked to become Aiden Ardenthal.\u201d\u201cWhy did you think that?\u201d\u201cIt is said that you can throw away your family name once you join the Knights, but there are only a handful of people who actually did that. And Sir Aiden didn\u2019t seem to hate his family that much.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t hate\u2026\u201dHe clicked his tongue.After the contest was over, he watched them.A fight between Baron Hillace and Aiden out of sight happened.\u2018Father must be terribly disappointed.\u2019\u2018It was all for our family. It was also for you!\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t want to inherit a family based on someone\u2019s sacrifice!\u2019\u2018Even so, b*st*rd!\u2019\u2018I am no longer a Hillace. If you need an heir, can\u2019t you bring someone else just like how you brought me?\u2019Baron Hillace was enraged at his words, so he attempted bringing him through force.However, since the wish of the swordsmanship tournament was granted, the captain stopped Baron Hillace, saying that Aiden was from Adenthal.There was also the influence of Adenthal\u2019s honorary knight, Verndia, but he said without showing any expression.\u201cBecause appearances aren\u2019t everything.\u201dRight. And more than was visible was usually a secret personal affair.Psychke nodded her head and focused on eating.Verndia looked at Aiden, who seemed to have no interest in her any more, and asked her as if tossing her.\u201cAbout Widnix. What were you trying to ask?\u201dHer personality made her not forget, and he seemed likely to ask later.If she\u2019s going to answer anyway, she\u2019d better shake it off rather than drag it.\u201cAh, I was wondering what you meant by \u2018He know the past better than anyone else\u2019.\u201dIt could be easily overlooked, but as someone who had talked with Widnix, it was embarrassing.He knew not only what no one knew before her regression, but also what happened after her death.How could he not know?\u201cAh, that.\u201dHe put down his cutlery and propped his chin to look out the window, pretending to be troubled.Since they were on the third floor, the scenery of the festival could be seen at a glance.Under the black sky, she saw buildings shining in all colors, and golden light, symbolizing the imperial family, rippled through them.It was because of the lanterns people carried.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret, but the Princess listened to Widnix\u2019s nonsense, and since he has the same ability, it should be okay.\u201dPsychke felt awkward about the word \u2018Ability\u2019 coming out of his mouth, but she didn\u2019t refute it and endured it.Every time he said \u2018supernatural\u2019 or \u2018powerful\u2019, she rejected it, saying that her ability was nothing but a curse.But at some point, something snapped in her head, and the voice that whispered, \u2018Your ability is a curse,\u2019 disappeared.From then on, she began to think, \u2018As the duke said, my ability could really be ice that does not melt.\u2019\u201cEach ability person has a superior ability called \u2018Authority\u2019. Each generation is slightly different, but the basis is the same.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know that there was something like \u2018Authority\u2019 at all.Psychke listened carefully to his words.\u201cTake me as an example- a flame made with magic can only burn something that has a form. But the flames I create burn even the incorporeal. Like time or space. This is called authority.\u201d\u201cAre there any restrictions?\u201d\u201cOf course, there is. I just explained it like that, but I can\u2019t burn everything. There is also a price to pay when you exercise your authority.\u201d\u201cSecret.\u201dVerndia lazily pulled the corners of her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s not good, so I won\u2019t tell you. Does the Princess know what her power is?\u201d\u201cNo. How can I find out?\u201d\u201cIt is good not to know. Knowing means that a situation has arrived where she has no choice but to use that authority. It means that when the time comes, that power will wake up on its own.\u201dSomething like loneliness flashed through his purple eyes for a moment.\u201cAnyway, the reason I said this is because of the authority of Widnix.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s important. Is it okay if you tell me everything?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even my authority, so what? In fact, it\u2019s not even a secret that Widnix has the same power every generation.\u201dHe patted her head with a serious expression.\u201cMemory Succession.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cEverything experienced in life is forcibly passed on to future generations. In a way, you could call it reincarnation. Because memories determine a person\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s a different person.\u201dPsychke stammered her words, surprised.According to that word, Widnix has hundreds of years of memories from the first Evergreen.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll even know who you are if you accumulate memories of so many people.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Words are power, but you can see them as a kind of curse.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately. I don\u2019t remember everything that happened even once.\u201dIf she mixes a drop of black ink in clear water, it turns black.However, if the amount of water is very large, it will swallow the ink instead of blackening it.Does Widnix really recognize that he is a human called \u2018Widnix Evergreen\u2019?\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why Evergreen hasn\u2019t moved in the East for generations. He tries not to talk much. It\u2019s because he is confused, but he doesn\u2019t want to build more memories there.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s why.\u201dWherever Widnix went, he would just keep his seat and leave without saying anything, scanning the surroundings with his cold eyes.Some nobles used to sarcastically say that the noble duke was like that because he didn\u2019t want to associate with trivial things, but after hearing the situation, she felt very sorry for him.However.\u2018Why did such a person try to kill me?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Berndia raised her eyebrows.\u201cThe 80% words that he says is nonsense. I wonder if you understand me now that you\u2019ve seen his appearance.\u201d\u201cBut I think it\u2019s necessary to pay attention to the Duke\u2019s life. So, the Duke\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe was speechless.What should she do?Keep her distance? Or kill herself before causing any harm?Verndia let out a long sigh at the sight of her expression, which was hardly straightening.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say this, but there is something the Princess should know.\u201dHe told a big story in a non-trivial tone.\u201cEven if with the Princess\u2019s help, my flame will extinguish me someday.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that everyone dies someday?\u201d\u201cNot that. Controlling the flame with medicine means there are limits.\u201d\u201cThat is not what I mean. But even with the control of medicine, there\u2019s limitations.\u201dIt was because he has some resistance over his flame. It was a thought of matter of fact.In an instant, a passage from Lestir\u2019s literature that he had told her before appeared in Psychke\u2019s mind.\u2018Lestir, who failed to handle his power, was gradually consumed by the flames.\u2019\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for his partner, Silkisia, he would have become one spark.\u2019\u2026 Currently, the position of the heir person in Silkisia is vacant.Even thinking about it, Psychke\u2019s complexion became pale.Verndia nodded his head in agreement.\u201cI have to see the heir before I die.\u201d\u201cIs that the time for you to say that?\u201d\u201cThen? Should I keep you, the Princess, by my side?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou told me to keep my distance from you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dVerndia said jokingly.\u201cIt\u2019s better to be extinguished than to die in a fire, so I\u2019d like you to stay by my side.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cYou do whatever you want. I won\u2019t stop you from doing anything. Unless you\u2019re dating another guy.\u201dVerndia handed over his decision.She knew it. The reason he mentioned medicine resistance was to comfort Widnix\u2019s heavy heart.So it was sadder.If I told you to stay for me, if you tried to tie me up by forcefully.Then I would have felt at least comfortable saying that it was inevitable.***The date, which was short but left a lot of emotion, was over.Psychke fell asleep on carriage as they were returning, as the brooch\u2019s validity period of 12 hours was slightly exceeded. The brooch had been removed and she was back to becoming small.And when she opened her eyes on Verndia\u2019s lap near his house, she touched her strangely tingling cheek.\u201cWhat did you do while I was sleeping?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe pretended to be innocent. He only wanted to touch her briefly but she was too soft\u2026No matter how many times he touched her, he could still feel it on her fingertips. It was her fault for being so soft. It was his own decision to think so.From the next day, the two started working on their backlog.He summoned Lia, who was busy without even opening her eyes due to the Doll Kingdom incident.\u201cHey, how can I do this\u2026\u201dLia appeared before them.Psychke could easily guess the reason.\u2018It seems that the case in the Doll Kingdom is not over yet.\u2019The investigation of the case, which was expected to end soon, was sluggish.This is because he denied that she was the one caught.\u201cThere was an imperial servant who supposedly had contact with the cult, but he\u2019s dead. Apparently a stabbing was disguised as a suicide. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more to this case.\u201dLia was begging him to remove her from the investigation using his authority.She was a rare, high-ranking mage, and she was being singled out.\u201cGreat. But I want you to investigate the people around Yzhar Silkisia.\u201d\u201cWhat else is for that?\u201dShe thought she would get some rest but then he was going to make her work. She waved her hand to him.\u201cYou have crows.\u201d\u201cIt is difficult to enter a place protected by magic. The princess told me and it seemed that Yzhar Silkisia seemed to be in that cult.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dVerndia told Lia what happened to Psychke during the incident.\u201cYou\u2019re saying Princess Psychke saw Yzhar with Shiona?\u201d\u201cYes. I saw them in the doll kingdom. At the swordsmanship competition, I tried to organize what I witnessed but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThe way I see it, that woman seemed to be in that cult, too.\u201dPsychke\u2019s eyes became wide.Lia grunted as she kicked the floor.\u201cAs expected. Every time I see her, I sensed a bad feeling.\u201d\u201cAnyway, Lia, let\u2019s find out more. I wish we could more what we had and\u2026\u201dHe took out the emerald with a hollow in the middle, which Psychke had received as a deposit from the jeweler.With one glance, she realized what it was, and Lia let out a gasp in her breath.\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d\u201cPlease cast some magic.\u201d\u201cWhat casting of magic are you talking about? Just smash it.\u201dLia pulled up the bottom of her trousers as if to stomp on it.Psychke quickly grabbed the emerald, and erndia stopped her with her words.\u201cThe princess borrowed it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t borrow anything. Where is that? I\u2019ll smash it.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop trying to do something you can\u2019t do and just cast some magic.\u201d\u201cSeriously\u2026\u2026. What magic.\u201d\u201cYou just have to let it break down on its own after a certain amount of time.\u201d\u201cUh, what is even that.\u201dUnable to remember, Lia walked around her parlor with a furrowed brow.Then she stopped abruptly and snapped her fingers.\u201cOh, I can use that. Give it to me, I\u2019ll hang it up.\u201d\u201cGreat. And one more thing.\u201d\u201cStop pampering yourself.\u201dVerndia totally ignored Lia who was glaring at me.\u201cI need a lie detection artifact.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cPlease, Miss Lia.\u201dPsychke opened her mouth, handing her the emerald.\u201cIt\u2019s related to Keitan\u2019s necklace. I hope you\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cI was going to make it anyway.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201cNoisy.\u201dShe fiercely glared at Verndia and left her seat. She will be ready soon, so she asked me to wait a few days.While waiting for Lia, Psychke prepared her perfume.It was because of the information Stella gave me last time.\u2018Duke Evergreen said he liked perfume.\u2019Now that he knows Widnix\u2019s secret, she realized that the information does not simply mean paying a bribe.She haven\u2019t figured the meaning behind yet but she thought there must be something under the surface.\u2018It\u2019s a problem that they\u2019re hostile to me, but I need Duke Evergreen\u2019s help to get my body back to normal.\u2019Verndia, who had been watching her quietly, said,\u201cI like perfume too.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI am saying the truth.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cGive me too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Later.\u201dAfter so many days.\u201cHey, it\u2019s done.\u201dA pitifully stunned Lia brought an enchanted emerald and a lie detection artifact.Psychke returned the emerald she received to the lathe.Meanwhile, Verndia made an appointment with the man of the black moon.* * *Verndia decided to meet the man in the cafe.It was a place that Isolet and Psychke had visited before, where Eavesdropping Magic Crystals were provided at each table.The original man Verndia hoped to see.It was because Verndia was afraid someone will eavesdrop if they met somewhere else.But Verndia refused the offer of going to the enemy\u2019s territory where there may be traps, so he suggested going to the caf\u00e9.In fact, the caf\u00e9 belonged to Lestir.\u300c \u201cGreat. See you there.\u201d \u300dHe thought the man would argue a few more times, but surprisingly, the man followed meekly.Does that mean it\u2019s urgent, or is there some other ulterior motive?He would soon find out his true intentions.* * *\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t come with him.\u201dThe knife-scarred man appeared just in time, smelling like cigarettes.As soon as he arrived, he found Psychke with her appearance altered with her bracelet.\u201cI thought he would come out.\u201d\u201cI heard you found me.\u201dPsychke was expressionless like the incompetent princess in the rumors, but she had a face that said she knew nothing.\u201cI heard what you said, but I would appreciate it if you could introduce yourself again.\u201dHe had spoken to Verndia before coming out here.First. When her appearance is altered by the bracelet, she is treated as a fictional character named \u201cK\u201d, a servant of Verndia.Second. Only Verndia knows about K and the man\u2019s negotiations.With these two things in mind, today\u2019s girl was a princess who came out at the request of her fianc\u00e9.\u2018Just by looking at his clothes, he came out as a merchant. What is his intention?\u2019Psychke glanced at the man.If she wanted to meet Verndia instead of her, he would have understood.With this appearance, there is no contact with him at all, so what is it for?Instead of opening his mouth, the man glanced up and down at Psychke. It was the appearance of a hawk just before hunting.\u201cLook away, will you?\u201dWhen Verndia arrived, he told his unpleasant feelings towards the man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I came to you to ask about His Excellency Lenox Slikisia.\u201dHis strange western accent reminded her of Stella.But, why is Lenox mentioned?Psychke was puzzled on the inside, but on the outside asked a question nonchalantly.\u201cAbout Lenox\u2019s affair?\u201dInstead of answering, Jess pulled out a thin book from his chest.Upon closer inspection, it was not a book, but a ledger made of several sheets of paper tied together like a book.\u201cThe Duke has ordered some things under the name of Silkisia. However, the due date is near yet he never visited at all, so I began looking for him.\u201dPsychke\u2019s face changed as she slowly flipped through what he handed her.Jewelry, decorative swords, dresses, shoes, silk, spices, tea utensils, etc.An amount equal to that of Silkisia\u2019s one-year budget was written on the ledger for only one month.It was Lennox\u2019s order for Lillian without hesitation.\u2018Right. I forgot.\u2019Previously, the same happened which he was occupied to solve.\u2018I had a hard time because of Lillian, but I really wanted to die because this problem came at the same time.\u2019She was afraid that Silkisia will go bankrupt.Therefore, she burdened herself on going to Blue Moon day and night begging them to cancel their debt.She had thought that her father would get mad if he found out about it and upon returning home, Lenox scolded her telling her why she cancelled it on her own.It seems that she was even beaten until she passed out.\u2018He was reluctant to revealing it to anyone of the family, and ever since Lillian came back, I became like a toy.\u2019But even so, doubts still remained.The people from the Blue Moon have never asked her for a meet up. The debt collection ledger flew to her and he was the first one. But why is Jess directly delivering it this time?\u2018The ledger seems to be cheating, and there seems to be some other reason for asking for a meeting.\u2019Psychke closed the ledger. Then she pressed her aching head with her hand.After she took the doctor\u2019s medication, she calmed down, so she thought she had recovered, but she\u2019s been like this sometimes since then.She asked her doctor, but she said there was nothing wrong with her body, so she said it would get better if she rested.Having calmed her pain, she pursed her lips.\u201cAs one of the Silkisia, I deeply apologize. Whereas, it is difficult for me to confirm family affairs as of the moment, so I apologize. I also would appreciate it if you send it to Silkisia instead.\u201d\u201cAll right. By the way, I will inform you that some of the items that you ordered will be delayed.\u201dJess, like a real tradesman, pointed to a place in the ledger with an appropriate courtesy.\u201cI heard that it is the item that the princess is most looking forward to, but I am sorry to inform you of such news.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t order it. I think Lillian was the one who did it.\u201dIn an instant, his eyes narrowed like those of an eagle capturing its prey.It was a small difference, but Psychke did not miss it.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the princess who came back a while ago. Then, did Princess Lillian order this item as well?\u201dHe went through the ledger a few more times.All the items that were named under Psychke were actually for Lillian.\u201cI see. You must be upset.\u201dJess let out a voice of regret.Even if you\u2019re a real daughter, aren\u2019t you upset that you only take care of Lillian? That\u2019s what it meant.Psychke answered without hesitation.\u201cNo, not at all. Lilian is father\u2019s real daughter. She went through all sorts of hardships and came back, so we have to take care of her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so naive, but you\u2019re an amazing person. Usually, you might not like her.\u201d\u201cWhy would I hate her? I still remember the day she returned, I was very happy.\u201dVerndia whispered in my ear, staring stunned at her fianc\u00e9e, who calmly told her lies.\u2018Princess, have you ever lied to me?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019Isn\u2019t it already a lie to say she didn\u2019t? Verndia became afraid of his ffianc\u00e9e.Ignorant of his thoughts, she raised the corners of her mouth gently toward Jess.She doesn\u2019t know why Jess is interested in Lillian, so she hides her true feelings with a smile.Jess, who was looking at the whispering \u00a0Verndia, said nonchalantly.\u201cYou two have a good relationship.\u201dPsychke calmly replied.\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the Duke\u2019s taking good care of me.\u201d\u201cPrincess Lillian must have been very jealous. She is such a greedy person.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean greedy?\u201d\u201cNo, I said it wrong. It has been a while since I talked about her, so I was happy.\u201dNo, this was not a mistake. He did that on purpose in hopes that someone would know his thoughts.Psychke chuckled and asked with a louder voice.\u201cYou mean Lillian? You are being rude. Although she has just returned, she is definitely the daughter of a Duke. Be polite.\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\u201cFrom what I heard, it sounds like you have a personal acquaintance with Princess Lillian.\u201dVerndia cuts him untimely.Psychke looked back at him, not knowing anything.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. They were hometown friends.\u201dHometown friends?Verndia sneaked out a sphere-shaped object from under the table. It was a lie detection artifact.He sensed the other person\u2019s lie and said it would turn red, but it was pure white. Which mean, Jess didn not lie.Psychke asked pretending to be surprised.\u201cHometown friends?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re also from the same upper class.\u201dWe\u2019re at the same class. The blue moon\u2019s parent is the black moon\u2019s. It\u2019s an assassin\u2019s guild.Jess sighed, as if the two were satisfied with his expression.His smile from the light looked somber.\u201cI have a favor to ask of you, Princess.\u201dHe took out a cigarette and asked. Then, he was stopped by Verndia, who was unpleased\u201cIt is a request.\u201d\u201cPlease make a meeting with Princess Lillian.\u201d\u201cDo you really need to ask me for that? You said you two were hometown friends, so you should contact her separately. Or maybe you could ask for a meeting with the ledger.\u201dJess replied slowly as she put the cigarette in her arms.\u201cI have already tried several times, she refused them all.\u201d\u201cLillian did?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the circumstances, but I don\u2019t know why I should arrange a meeting when Lillian doesn\u2019t want to meet you.\u201d\u201cDid you not hear what the duke said?\u201dIt means that she will not tell her the whereabouts of the necklace unless she arranges a meeting.Psychke looked at Verndia in a way that said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dVerndia pretended to be embarrassed.\u201cI think I need some time to talk with the princess, for now, please get out.\u201d\u201cAs much as you like.\u201dAfter an insincere greeting, Jess went outside. As soon as she left, she took out a cigarette and breathed* *Psychke made sure Jess didn\u2019t install a bug or something.She had to be careful about anything because she didn\u2019t know how she found out the culprit of the auction house case.Verndia, on the other hand, snorted and buried his body on the soft sofa with his legs crossed.Then he began to lean slightly toward his fianc\u00e9e.\u201cFirst of all, I think we need to know the relationship between Jess and Princess Lillian. Any guesses?\u201d\u201cI have, but.\u201dShe had overheard the chatter of Lillian and her ladies-in-waiting.She said she was at the same class before she returned to Silkisia, and lived in the west before going to the top.It was a time when she was eagerly recalling her vague memories.Verndia, who was completely attached to her because of her tilt, snapped his fingers in front of her eyes.\u201cI want you to tell me a little bit instead of thinking alone.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPsychke was startled when she finally realized that he was leaning towards her.She reflexively tried to distance himself, but he was sitting by the wall and had nowhere to go.Before she could get out of the way, he bent down and blurte,\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHe wrapped the silver hair that was tickling her face around his fingers in a languid motion, as if to invite him to look at him.As instructed, Psychke looked downward.The forehead lightly covered with pitch-black hair, the two eyes that were subtly opened, and the red lips with dark arcs were very tempting.It was also what he was aiming for.\u201cHurry. I\u2019m curious.\u201dHis face lit up with sensual purple eyes.Psychke untied his hair from his fingers and averted his gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t play around.\u201d\u201cI never did.\u201dVerndia laughed seductively as he snatched her hair away from her.\u201cCome to think of it, Princess.\u201dHe wrapped her silver hair in his hand, pulled it softly, and breathed near her.Psychke was embarrassed by the breath on her chin, and she was at a loss.\u201cLooking at you earlier, you were really good at lying. You really never lied to me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVerndia glanced at the lie detection artifact. It was white.He murmured in a slightly disappointed tone.\u201cSo you meant it when you said you wouldn\u2019t have any feelings for me\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll try harder. So, what\u2019s the conclusion?\u201dPsychke avoided his gaze and tried to calm her flushed face. She barely managed to calm her beating heart.\u201cLilian said she lived in the West before coming to the capital. That man also spoke a western dialect.\u201dSeeing the serious content, Verndia straightened his posture.He didn\u2019t forget to straighten her messy hair.Even though she was quietly fiddling with her ear lobe.\u201cAre you sick anywhere? Why are your ears so hot?\u201d\u201cI am not sick. I wouldn\u2019t call people in the capital a hometown friend, so I think thhey met in the West when they were young.\u201d\u201cHmm, it\u2019s really hot. But, what do you mean from the same class\u201cLet go of my ears and listen. The reason Lillian came to the capital was because of a guild. She said she was tricked into saying that she would make a lot of money. It makes sense if the guild she meant was the Blue Moon.\u201d\u201cWell, it seems to be correct just by hearing the circumstances.\u201d\u201cYou can ask.\u201d\u201cWill she answer the question?\u201d\u201cYes. She will.\u201dJess, seen from the alleyway, looked at the information she knew and gave the correct answer, with a mixture of curiosity and liking.His personality seemed to tell him that it would be good if he got the right answer.\u201cHowever, I think it would be better if the Duke said this. After digging through the information I was given, I came up with an answer, that way.\u201dSince she was pretending to be an ignorant princess, she shouldn\u2019t have stepped up on her own.\u201cAre you a friend from her hometown, or are you from the same hometown, so it\u2019s all information about your relationship with Lillian. It must have been the intention of trying to offend the duke.\u201dKnowing that Lillian ended up with the necklace, they must have been close.That must have meant it, Psychke finished speaking.Verndia agreed.\u201cOh, and the princess should keep pretending not to know about the necklace.\u201dThose who investigated the Leas case thought that the current Silkisia and the royal family were behind the theft of the necklace.So, she didn\u2019t know what to say when it became known that she, a Silkisian, was tracking her necklace.\u201cYes, got it. Oh, one more thing.\u201dPsychke put her lips near his ear and said something softly.Verndia\u2019s ears turned red at the sound of her warm breath.\u201cAsk why Lillian is so obsessed with her necklace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please tell me the date and time you want-\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dVerndia frowned at her and intervened.He crossed his arms and legs as if he was displeased at this situation.\u201cIsn\u2019t it different from before, Princess? Are you serious?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201dPsychke averted her eyes and let out a heavy breath, looking like someone who had made a difficult decision.\u201cI think I explained enough.\u201dVerndia brushed his hair roughly.\u201cThat person is dangerous.\u201dThe eyes of \u2018that person\u2019 turned horizontally. He looked like he was interested of what Verndia had to say.Psychke raised her sly eyes and looked at Jess.Certainly, having scars on your face looks dangerous at first glance, but\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to judge risk based on a person\u2019s physical appearance.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean that.\u201dHe was feeling uncomfortable, so he tapped his lap.\u201cThis is not what I wanted to talk about.\u201dHe pretended to whisper to Psychke.Psychke was startled and expressed her confusion.However, since she was basically expressionless, it didn\u2019t work out for dramatic facial expressions, so she pretended to be trembling in fear and turned her back.\u201cAh, an assassin!\u201d\u201cIf you say it like that.\u201dVerndia pointed to his temple in an annoyed manner.Meanwhile, Jess looked at Verndia in bewilderment.He thought he knew who he was because he was a man with good information, but he didn\u2019t expect him to tell his fianc\u00e9e about it.Psychke said with her still-turned back.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think it\u2019s better to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. Yes, let\u2019s pretend nothing had happened.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do?\u201dJess, whose affairs had gone awry in an instant, asked, exhaling a lot of air.Verndia shrugged her shoulders.\u201cBecause I can\u2019t put my future sister-in-law in danger.\u201dYour sister-in-law?Psychke\u2019s eyes trembled for a moment. Jess, who hadn\u2019t seen it, cheekily asked.\u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201dThe way to fret someone is to give and then take.Sure enough, Jess, who had messed things up right in front of his eyes, lost his cool.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to kill her.\u201dVerndia glanced down at the artifact in his hand. It was white.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t kill, it can mean as a threat.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\u2026 Red. It was a lie.\u2018You won\u2019t kill but you have enough personal feelings to threaten. Was it a personal grudge?\u2019This makes it ambiguous to prepare a seat hastily.Verndia sincerely frowned at him.\u201cHow should I believe that?\u201d\u201cThe only thing I am afraid is the Duke.\u201dJess glanced at Psychke, who was looking back.It was a threat that he would inform the people of Silkisia that he was tracking Keitan\u2019s necklace.\u201cDo it.\u201dVerndia was rather calm.\u201cIf you want to regret it, feel free to.\u201d\u201cAll right. What do you want?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s pause, Verndia pretended to persuade his fianc\u00e9e and put his lips to her ear.In return, Psychke whispered the answer he had in mind.\u2018- I think we can do it.\u2019\u2018Great.\u2019He looked at Jess, pretending to comfort his trembling fianc\u00e9e.\u201cIn an open place, where I and the princess can see. On the condition that if you do anything stupid, I will blow your throat right away. If it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll do it right away.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an immediate answer, but it wasn\u2019t a lie either. It was also a condition where he couldn\u2019t lie.Assassins were brainwashed so that they would not die on their own unless they were commissioned.It was because there were a lot of people who made such an attempt due to the shock of killing a person.In other words, he couldn\u2019t touch Lillian because it is their agreement.After completing the agreement, Verndia asked for permission to talk about the necklace in secret with Jess.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Princess, could you step aside for a moment?\u201dPsychke nodded her head and left.Then she waited outside the cafe, and after seeing Jess left, he returned.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dVerndia had a somewhat strange expression.* *The next day, Psychke sent Lillian a letter asking for a one-on-one meeting.The answer came shortly thereafter.\u300c \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u300dPsychke stared down at Lillian\u2019s brief, insincere reply.She pretended that she was a kind person but was so bland to her.Well, everyone knew what kind of person she was, but it was better than wearing a mask.\u201cShe moved her pen so slow.\u201d\u300c \u201cI know you received blessing from the Holy Temple but the holy water turned black.\u201d \u300dTwo people, Widnix and Verndia, officially participated in Lillian\u2019s discernment ceremony.At Lillian\u2019s request, the two decided to keep the determination result a secret.So, to Lillian, it was like a thunderbolt in the dry sky.She immediately accepted Psychke\u2019s offer.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201dLillian\u2019s face was distorted seeing her up close after a while.At first glance, Melissa\u2019s usual flamboyant dress for her was noticeable yet under her eyes she seemed she hadn\u2019t slept well.\u2018There won\u2019t be a farewell ceremony and necklace making.\u2019Due to timing, the emerald, which will be the main axis of the necklace, must have been broken by Lia\u2019s magic.The money was spent as it was, but nothing came in, so she must be in a pretty upset state.\u2018It\u2019s going to be difficult to make it again since the duke worked with famous craftsmen to prevent the same request from being submitted.\u2019If the ledger arrives here sooner or later from the Blue Moon, it will be worse. Psychke laughed inwardly.Lillian, unaware of it, became contemplative, and she murmured.\u201cNo way, Duke Verndia\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Isn\u2019t it rude to say that when you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cThen how about you?\u201dThe fact that the holy water had turned black was ominous to anyone.The Empire was not a country with a strong theocracy, but it was also not a weak one.If the outcome of the discernment ceremony spreads, it is certain that the image of the poor princess who returned after all her hardships will be shattered.Lillian trembled in her astonishment, anger, and shame.Psychke tried to reassure her with kind words.Even so, Lillian was indifferent to her.\u201cBecause there are no perfect secrets in this world. I have no intention of ordering people to spread it like anyone else.\u201dPsychke brought up the rumor that Lillian had spread by ordering Hilvia to be a \u2018foul-behaved princess\u2019.Without a hint of conscience, Lillian snorted at her.\u201cWould a rootless tree have leaves? Why are you questioning me? Rumors like that spread probably because your conduct was filthy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fine.\u201dYou\u2019re not sorry for me, so I won\u2019t be sorry for you either.After clearing her mind, Psychke coldly parted her lips.\u201cI will tell you directly. Where is the necklace with the big emerald on it?\u201d\u201cEmerald necklace?\u201dLillian blinked her eyelids with her innocent deer eyes.\u201cWhat is that? Why are you finding something you own from me?\u201d\u201cI heard that it was abandoned with you in the desert 18 years ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dLillian\u2019s expression contorted in shock.Before she could come back to her senses and escape the topic, Psychke said,\u201cSomeone saw what you had right before you came to Silkisia. Speak, where did you hide it?\u201d\u201cThat is mine. Why are you looking for it?\u201dHer Lillian voice sharpened.\u201cWhy are you taking what\u2019s mine again after taking my father and the duke from me?\u201d\u201cYou know now, too, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s Keitan\u2019s necklace.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt looks like it will be taken away by the imperial family as evidence if caught, so you must have tried to make a fake one and exchange it with the real one, instead.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 how much do you know?\u201dLillian was pale as if she was showered with flour.When her silver eyebrows and pale lips were combined, the only color left on her face was her blue eyes.She was usually pale, but when she is like this, she seemed like a walking corpse.Psychke suddenly remembered the words of her father, which she had overheard.\u2018Lillian, she can never come back! With my own hands-!\u2019\u201cWhy do you bully me like this?\u201dHer fists, tightly gripped by the hem of her fancy skirt, trembled with rage.Lillian yelled, distorting her face in an awkward way.\u201cDid I do anything to you? That was not the reason! I was just trying to get mine back. But why are you being so mean? Why?\u201dHer eyes flashed ferociously.\u201cWith the thought of you, I asked father to not kick you put because I pitied you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI also stopped Lenox when he tried to hit you. And when he started a rumor about you beating a soldier, I told him how hard it must had been for you!\u201d\u201cThank you so much. It brought me to tears.\u201d\u201cBut you!\u201dLillian snapped.\u201cWhat are you? Stealing my father\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t enough, you even stole the duke\u2019s attention, and now even my necklace?\u201dLillian caught her deep breath. Then, raising one corner of her mouth at an angle, she sneered.\u201cWhy, did you think that if you presented that necklace, His Majesty would look at you kindly and prevent you from being sold to Hestie?\u201dHer absurd words gave her a thick headache.Psychke decided to listen quietly to see how far that absurd idea was going.Lillian, who mistook her for her shock to have lost her speech, sighed.\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you know? Then take this opportunity to find out. You will be sold to Hestie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe location is great, but the climate is so-so bad, so outsiders say it\u2019s hard to come out alive once you enter. Well, since you\u2019re going to be the queen, you won\u2019t freeze to death.\u201dPsychke calmly drank her tea.Lillian, whose rage intensified at her indifference, fired at her.\u201cWhat is that look? Ah- the \u2018I\u2019m engaged to the Duke of Berndia, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be sold\u2019. What are you trying to say? Well, the duke would value the north more than you, so how about that?\u201dLillian\u2019s eyes was filled with the joy of victory.\u201cSooner or later, His Majesty the Emperor, will dispatch an order of knights on the condition of breaking the engagement. If he was me, I would have broken off the engagement right away, but I don\u2019t know how the Duke feels.\u201d\u201cI heard that the duke gave an answer right on the spot, but you seem unheard of it.\u201d\u201cOh yeah. He said he had no intention of breaking up with you. Do you believe that?\u201d\u201cI believe.\u201dA sentence of two heavy syllables lay on the floor of silence.Lillian\u2019s eyes widened, as if surprised by the unwavering reaction.However, it didn\u2019t take long for it to bend as sharp as his fingernails.\u201cYou are naive.\u201d\u201cThink whatever you want. Where is the necklace?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re funny. Why are you looking for a necklace when you believe the duke? And do you think I will tell you that?\u201d\u201cOh. Otherwise, I intend to spread the results of your discernment.\u201d\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t spreading it earlier-\u201d\u201cYou believed that?\u201dPsychke returned exactly what she had just heard.\u201cYou are naive.\u201d(TN: BURN!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How do you think people would see you as?\u201dPsychke crossed her arms and tilted her head.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not the case, it\u2019s an incident that Silkisia is entangled in but was silent, so it must look suspicious enough.\u201d\u201cDo you think people will care about what happened 20 years ago?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably about throwing stones at the calm water.\u201dAll you have to do is knock on the hearts of those who find the incident suspicious.All you have to do is to give up digging into the terrible oppression and disappearing evidence, and only draw out the suspicions of the people who hid.There are many people who disapprove of the current emperor and Silkisia.Then the Leas case will be ignited again, and maybe\u2026\u201cDo you think you will be okay then? You are Silkisia too!\u201d\u201cSince when did I say that I was a Silkisia?\u201dPsychke laughed helplessly.\u201cSay, where is the necklace?\u201dLillian hesitated. She crumpled her fine eyebrows and fidgeted with her beautiful nails.And she resolutely opened her mouth.\u201cNo. I won\u2019t answer you.\u201dFine. No matter what I threat, I knew it would come out like this.Because to Lillian, Keitan\u2019s necklace is,\u201cThat\u2019s not the mark your mother left, Lillian.\u201dIt was like the only trace left by her mother.This was the answer to Psychke\u2019s personal question to Verndia, \u2018Why was Lillian so obsessed with necklaces?\u2019\u201cYou, how did you know that one, too?\u201dPsychke spoke dryly to Lillian, who was taken aback.\u201cI met a guy named Jess.\u201d\u201cWhy does he want you?!\u201d\u201cHe asked about you, so I asked him to meet you in person.\u201dLillian\u2019s hand, hidden by the hem of her dress, trembled. She was afraid of meeting Jess.Psychke saw it clearly.\u201cI said I would set up a place for him, but if you don\u2019t want to meet him, you don\u2019t have to. I speak well-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. That\u2019s my affair, don\u2019t mind-!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dEven to shut her mouth, Lillian will meet with Jess.Then it\u2019s comfortable for me, Psychke nodded her head in agreement.\u201cAnyway, he said. You wore a necklace every moment until someone tried to steal it. You said my mother would come to see me soon if I had this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know she will not.\u201dLillian\u2019s expression softened in an instant.An object that should have been kept as evidence to the imperial family was found in the middle of the desert.Someone had abandoned it there to destroy evidence.So even the five-year-old girl found with her necklace wasn\u2019t actually lost\u2026\u201cOr what?\u201dThe abandoned princess, who had been biting her lip, asked poisonously.\u201cWhat do you care? That necklace is mine. Don\u2019t pay attention to it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not eye-catching.\u201d\u201cThe necklace, my mother\u2019s or not, has protected me. Thanks to her, I miraculously survived in the middle of the desert, and was able to meet Duke Evergreen and come all this way.\u201dLillian gripped her chest like someone wearing a necklace. She smiled proudly, her eyes shining like a fanatic.\u201cRumor? Do whatever you feel like. The necklace will protect me this time too!\u201d\u201cAs expected.\u201dThat posture of holding her chest tight whenever you\u2019re having a hard time is a posture she had seen a lot.She guessed Lillian had been used to it.It never occurred to her that she would be able to find out where the real necklace was.That was not the purpose of summoning Lillian today.Psychke took her luck quietly.\u201cThe real Keitan necklace wasn\u2019t a poison dart necklace.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf it was a poison dart necklace, you wouldn\u2019t be doing that.\u201dLillian\u2019s hand, which was clutching her chest, fell helplessly. Her face was completely white.Even as she looked at it, her face was bitter.She was really framed, Leas case.For some reason, Psychke felt that she was going to cry, so she bit her lip.* *\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a poison dart necklace?\u201dLia, who had been contacted by Verndia, staggered to her knees.She looked like a distraught person.\u201cRight. I knew it. I knew it.\u201dShe looked down at her parlor floor with her empty eyes.Tears fell on the polished marble.\u201cLeas couldn\u2019t have done that\u2026 Dural you bastard!\u201dDural was the name of the current Baron Hillace.Lia, who had been calling out to Dural with bloodshot eyes, poured out her madness.\u201cYou b*stard! You tricked me even though you knew everything! I saw Leas conspire against treason, and she\u2019ll die at this rate! I, I will kill you!\u201dLia\u2019s eyes, which had been shouting, howling, and cursing without hesitation, landed on one spot.It was Aiden standing next to him with his head bowed with a gloomy expression.Lia apologized profusely.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cNo. I was also the one who condoned my father\u2019s behavior on the pretext of being young.\u201dI knew the relationship between Lia and Hillace long ago.Aiden fully understood her feelings.Lia, who had been cursing for a while, looked at Verndia, who was immersed in his thoughts expressionlessly.There were only three people in the parlor because Psychke said she had a headache and wanted to rest.After sparks flew from his wagon, she often complained of her headaches.\u201cSo what about the necklace? You said Lillian or someone had it. Can\u2019t you just take it from that person?\u201dVerndia, who was pondering something about her, replied.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\u201cWhy, because she is a princess of Silkisia? You don\u2019t care about that.\u201d\u201cWhy would I\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s not good to hand over what you have to do to others.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t find a reason to step in unless the Princess asked for it.As long as she clearly knew that she was framed, it wouldn\u2019t change anything right away just because she came looking for the necklace.\u2018Only the emperor can lay such a false accusation on Silkisia. Even if you find the original and reinvestigate it, nothing will change much. What if the Princess regains her memory?\u2019Verndia was once again lost in shallow thoughts.It was Lia\u2019s crying voice that broke it.\u201cBut is that really true? Isn\u2019t it fake again?\u201d\u201cIt must be right. It matches exactly the characteristics of the necklace you described.\u201dVerndia pointed at Lia with her chin.\u201cA large emerald gold necklace.\u201dUp to this point, Lia\u2019s expression on her face hadn\u2019t changed.However, as she continued, it became worse.\u201cA broken lock, the initials G.S engraved on the back of an emerald. A cool blue aura that surrounds and protects the necklace when a great shock is applied.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s my magic.\u201dTears welled up in Lia\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhen the baby accidentally broke the lock, I put a protective spell on it so that it won\u2019t break again.\u201d\u201cYou said you broke Her Majesty\u2019s gift?\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a present for Her Majesty the Empress.\u201dWith a trembling voice, Lia wiped her wet eyes with her sleeve.\u201cIt was a gift from Leas to her baby. It was basically a necklace with a big emerald the color of her eyes.\u201d \u201cIt was a gift from the emperor.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201dLia cried.\u201cI don\u2019t know either\u2026\u00a0 Dural should have not believed that bastars! She said she saw clearly when Leas asked for extra work on her necklace and put stinger in it!\u201dUnable to overcome her anger, Lia finally cried out as she hit her ground.Aiden, her visibly darkened expression, pulled out his handkerchief.Verndia clicked her tongue.\u201cDoes that mean the dead come back?\u201dThe bloodshot eyes turned to him.Sadness only dulls people. I understand how she feel, but it was not what she needed right now.Verndia spoke harshly.\u201cWhat happened to the magic on the princess you said you were looking for?\u201d\u201cYou really are a bastard with no blood or tears.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since that was gone. What is the answer?\u201d\u201cAs expected, it is forbidden magic.\u201dLia calmly continued her explanation, dabbing her tears with Aiden\u2019s handkerchief.\u201cDo you remember the baby\u2019s original name?\u201d\u201cI asked her about it, but it didn\u2019t work. She couldn\u2019t remember her name, even any of her childhood memories.\u201d\u201cMe too. Isn\u2019t it weird? It\u2019s said that paper records can be cut out, but human memories can\u2019t be done like that.\u201d\u201cIs that because of forbidden magic?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard that among the forbidden magics, there is a kind that obscures the existence of people.\u201dA look of despair spread across Lia\u2019s face.If it weren\u2019t for that magic, she would have recognized her right away when she came to ask the Magic Association.At least she must have felt a sense of Deja vu that she resembled someone.\u201cI think it\u2019s got a stronghold. She didn\u2019t even know who she was. She reinforced it by overlaying her false memories on it.\u201d\u201cThen you can break it. Did you find a way?\u201d\u201cThe best thing is to find the wizard who cast the spell on it.\u201d\u201cShiona, isn\u2019t that the woman? They say she\u2019s good at hallucinations and mental systems.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still looking into it, but I think you\u2019re right, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to let her go, so I\u2019ve come up with the next best thing: a neutralizer.\u201dLia mentioned a neutralizing spell that is used to dispel magic by those who have been affected by mental magic.\u201cUntil now, I didn\u2019t tell you because I had to know exactly the principle of the magic to neutralize it, but now I\u2019ve found the principle.\u201d\u201cA neutralizer. Making potions isn\u2019t your specialty, is it?\u201d\u201cHmm. It\u2019s not something that can be solved by pouring my strength into it like the medicine you take. So, I\u2019m going to ask a friend.\u201d\u201cWith just that, will the magic on the Princess be completely lifted?\u201dLia nodded her head with her confident face.\u201cIn theory, yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little strange, Lia.\u201dHis eyes, finding the contradiction, narrowed like incontinence. His purple eyes that appeared between them fell coldly.Lia was stingy, but she straightened her back as if nothing was wrong on the outside.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy do you know so well?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201dHe slowly rested his chin on the back of his hand. And then she spoke more slowly than he did.\u201cThe neutralizing agent is only effective when you know \u2018exactly\u2019 the principles of the magic it is trying to neutralize.\u201d\u201cYes. And now that I know the principle-\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s weird.\u201dVerndia cut her off.\u201cThere is so little information that it is said that forbidden magic is dead. That\u2019s what you should know best. You haven\u2019t been able to find a magic formula even after ten years of searching.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then, after about a month of trying to find out a magic that would work on the Princess, you found the principles.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLia.\u201dThere was power in his voice that grabbed attention.Lia flinched but couldn\u2019t look away either.\u201cWho are you? Who informed you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Does it matter now?\u201d\u201cIt does. Since it\u2019s called a cult.\u201dShe also possesses considerable knowledge of forbidden magic.\u201cWell, I think I know who it is.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I know you hate forbidden magic, but-\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you.\u201dLately, Lia has been busy investigating the Doll Kingdom case, and she had no time to meet new people.Even if she had met someone investigating the case. If she was an admirer, she would have told him, but she didn\u2019t.She gave away detailed information about forbidden magic but did not reveal her source.It\u2019s not often that she comes out this way, sacrificing her body for anything.Perhaps, it has something to do with blood.And judging from that response, it seemed to be the correct answer.\u201cI was wondering why you came here with her even though I only called Lia.\u201dIf there was something wrong in Lia\u2019s explanation, she must have come to subtly correct it.Verndia gnashed her teeth.A red line was drawn on Aiden\u2019s skin- he was lightly cut.Even if Lia hadn\u2019t been involved with the Princess, he would have ignited the flames and tortured her.Aiden answered, forcing a voice that didn\u2019t want to come out.\u201cI only know a little about the theory of the mental system.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI stole the research documents and materials of the magician who visited me from time to time.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere was something I wanted to do.\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201dVerndia\u2019s voice was cold.It felt like walking on a knife blade caught in a cliff. If Aiden makes a little bit of mistake, his neck will be gone.Aiden replied in a dry voice.\u201cI was trying to revive someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThat.\u201dAiden\u2019s lips closed. After that, no matter how much time passed, he never raised his voice.Verndia\u2019s eyes gradually narrowed.Lia hurriedly intervened as she saw purple sparks start to fly from his fingertips.\u201cHe can\u2019t use magic! I recognized it before. He has body that has no mana, so he can\u2019t do anything!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know the simple theory! You know. Knowing that doesn\u2019t make me a worshiper!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a simple theory.\u201dHis emotionless eyes were thrown at her.\u201cWhy did you hide it? Were you afraid I will kill you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou left Shiona and Yzhar intact?\u201d\u201cYou hate Hillaces\u2019. But when you find out that there is a worshiper\u2026\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dHe was frustrated.His eyes met Aiden, then Lia, then Aiden again. And he made his way to the window of the parlor for the last time.Green leaves were shaking and tapping on the window in the cold wind, as if they were going to come at least once.\u201cDo you know why I hate Hillaces\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wasn\u2019t it because we betrayed the former Silkisia and joined the current Silkisia?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the reason the Princess\u2019s family hates Hillace, and I\u2019m a bit different.\u201dAfter she brought her words out, Verndia shut his mouth, not feeling the reason to explain himself.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t trust me, but I thought you\u2019d try to hide this information.\u2019It was too bad that he stole information about forbidden magic to make them understand their point of view.He wondered what to do with these people.So, he weighed his thoughts and slowly turned his head to Aiden.\u201cDoes Baron Hillace have anything to do with forbidden magic?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you know at all. At the request of the Duke of Silkisia, we provided a place for research.\u201dVerndia gently closed his eyes.It is the Duke of Silkisia and Yzhar isn\u2019t the only one involved in forbidden magic.Logan is a weakling. If he didn\u2019t do it at all, he couldn\u2019t do this alone.So, like in the Leas case, there must be an emperor behind the forbidden magic.\u2018The emperor could be behind the monsters that appeared in the north.\u2019After organizing his thoughts, Verndia slowly opened his eyes.He watched the two Hillace with a guilty expression on their faces, then asked a series of questions.\u201cThat wizard. Did you see who it was?\u201d\u201cNo. Every time he come, he wears a hood, so I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d\u201cWhat was the study about?\u201d\u201cIt was about a reagent that separates a certain force from the human soul. Now that I think about it, I think it must have been the power of God.\u201d\u201cWhat is the progress?\u201d\u201cIt is almost done. I tried to bring some of it as evidence, but the moment it came out, it was burned and I couldn\u2019t bring it out.\u201d\u201cDid you find out about it and get chased by witches?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cWho were you trying to revive with the knowledge you gained?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I tried to save Princess Psychke, whom I thought was dead.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dA slight headache arose from the words he did not know whether they were true or false.That \u2018Hillace\u2019 was prepared to endanger\u00a0 his \u00a0life and saving the Princess?It\u2019s nonsense.Originally, he wanted to threaten him by telling him not to lie but couldn\u2019t do it with the thought of the Princess.Alright, we\u2019ll fix this later. Because this was not urgent right now.However, I decided to leave a clear warning rather than let it skip.\u201cYou will hear about that later. If you do nonsense in the meantime, I will kill you.\u201dAiden, who was depressed, turned pale.Verndia, who didn\u2019t care about that, put his sword back in and looked at Lia, who was also looking pale.\u201cWhen can we meet that wizard who can make neutralizers?\u201d\u201cOh, oh? He says he\u2019s okay anytime. He told me to come when I have time because I don\u2019t have to make a reservation separately.\u201dLia was nervous so she took out thing that Verndia asked for.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about forbidden magic. He told me only the ingredients needed and asked them to make it just like this. But they said they needed the blood of the patient-\u201d\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s go tomorrow.\u201dHe abandoned both of them and turned his back.As he was about to leave the living room, he stopped and opened his mouth, but his gaze was on the door.\u201cThis is the last time I will let this go.\u201dHe wanted to get rid of them, but he is worried for the Princess.\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll hate me.\u2019Lia and Aiden were the ones to whom she gave her affection. If I harm them, she will distance herself from me.\u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do next.\u2019I warned them so they should know what to do.He temporarily hold on this treatment for the both of them.* *It was after the two had just been sent.Verndia went to Psychke who was resting in bed and told her everything.Because the doctor had just visited, Psychke was wearing a brooch.\u201cA strange spell is upon me? Was it because of that magic that my head hurts so much, and that my superpower is considered a curse?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn the meantime, Verndia hadn\u2019t told her that her memories have spell.He couldn\u2019t find a solution, because he didn\u2019t want to bother her.But he told her everything now that he found a way.He wanted Psychke to find her memories.She wanted everything she deserved back.But that means having to face the harsh reality.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t do it. If your head hurts, I will try to find another way.\u201dHe stroked her hair with a loving hand.Even if she hates to find her memories, he had no intention of turning away from her.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to believe.\u201dPsychke groaned and touched her forehead. Every time she talked about magic, her headache got worse.\u201cBut the duke is not the kind of person who would lie about something like this. There\u2019s no reason to lie.\u201dPsychke lowered her hand and looked at Verndia with deeply sunken eyes.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\u201cA mental preparation that won\u2019t fall apart.\u201dHe was worried that she would become discouraged and collapse after learning everything about her.Though from what he had seen of her, he was sure she could handle it.He whispered softly, soothingly.\u201cOnce you find out, you won\u2019t be able to go back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI was afraid of why the duke warned her over and over again, but she didn\u2019t live so weakly that she would turn away in fear of something that didn\u2019t even happen.Didn\u2019t I swear before that I won\u2019t live this life like a fool again?I will check anything without running away.She decided to approach the \u2018truth\u2019 that Verndia said.Verndia let out a small sigh and raised his hand.When he decided a certain thing, he doesn\u2019t look back but when it comes to Psychke, he always looked like an idiot.He gently stroked her cheek with the back of his hand. Because of this ability, his body temperature was lower than that of ordinary people, and he was cool.\u201cDon\u2019t be too depressed, I\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\u201cWhy are you helping me, Duke?\u201dPsychke hesitated and asked.In fact, she knew why he was helping. She couldn\u2019t be unaware because of the feelings shared by their ring.But she wanted a definitive answer.There is a big difference between simply interpreting what has been shared and hearing it directly.Verndia smiled and lightly flicked her forehead.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the right time to talk about it. Let\u2019s talk about it later.\u201d(TN: Wait, they\u2019re being closer and sweeter tho\u2026 the flick to the forehead, too. Uuugh, my heearrrttttt!!)Confession of feelings before doing something important. It\u2019s not a scene from a romance novel, isn\u2019t it too ominous?\u201cYes. Please tell me later.\u201dPsychke readily agreed.(TN: Finally, a communication! Ugh.)Then she hesitated for a moment, then lowered her eyes and said lightly.\u201cAt that time, I will also ask something of the Duke.\u201d\u201cYou can do it now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to listen to the Duke\u2019s words first.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we do it now? I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201cPardon, I can\u2019t.\u201dPsychke smiled lightly but firmly refused.Verndia had no choice but to withdraw.(TN: I thought a kiss to the forehead will happen, saaad.)The next day, they visit the Magic Association with Lia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fakes Don\u2019t Want To Be RealCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat, the smell of winter?\u201dThe sorceress, Lia\u2019s friend, was a girl who looked about 15 years old.She had silver bobbed hair and was wearing a large red bun hat, and her bun hat twitched a little as if there was something inside her.\u201cIt\u2019s strange that you\u2019re a human with the smell of winter.\u201dShe said she needed the blood of a patient to make a neutralizer, so she drew her blood.She then tried to pour straight into the ingredients, but she sniffed her flask with her nose, saying she smelled like winter.The smell of winter, is that wizard a beast like Croa?Psychke guessed so and asked.\u201cWhat is the smell of winter?\u201d\u201cOh? Oh, can I tell you?\u201dThe wizard blinked her enlarged eyes. She pondered momentarily then asked.\u201cIt\u2019s just a little soul-crushing, or should I say, painful. It\u2019s not going to stop you from living, so you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cMy soul is torn and I am fine?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s my first time smelling it, and it\u2019s unique. Young Su-ins\u2019 will like it.\u201dAfter shaking the flask a few times and pouring the blood into the container, she began adding the ingredients she had prepared.\u201cYou know, humans who smell like winter need to add one more ingredient. Because the soul is in an unstable state, the neutralizer may not work.\u201d\u201cWhich?\u201d\u201cIt is a bell-shaped trumpet yellow flower called, Dallua. But I don\u2019t have it right now, it\u2019s all gone.\u201d\u201cEven in the warehouse?\u201dLia, who had been listening beside her, interrupted.It means that there are no warehouses used by the association for public use.The red-hat wizard nodded her head.\u201cYes. I took it for the Imperial Family to use at war.\u201d\u2018Imperial family?\u2019It was a casual tone, but Psychke was concerned.The efficacy of Dallua was known even to her.A type of sedative used primarily in times of war to relieve tension and boost morale.However, overusing it makes it dangerous which maximizes emotions then make someone numb\u2026\u2018I heard that the northern monsters became strange.\u2019She heard that demons began to exhibit abnormal phenomena after the duke rejected the emperor\u2019s proposal to break off their marriage.\u2018I heard that they attack even on the verge of dying as if they don\u2019t feel pain.\u2019She got to know it because she accidentally overheard Verndia and Isolet talking about it.He said that the monsters had become more ferocious than before and that they were investigating the cause, but there was no result.He also said that it is difficult to withstand Lia\u2019s magic alone.\u2018Is it too much to guess that the Imperial Family must have taken it to where the Knights are inevitably needed?\u2019Psychke bit her lips softly at her strange sinisterness.Verndia, who had been quiet until then, intervened.\u201cSo, are you saying you can\u2019t make it?\u201d\u201cI can make it if I get Dallua.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get you. What room is it?\u201d\u201cLia, you have to help me with this. I can\u2019t make it today by myself.\u201dLia, who was about to leave her seat naturally, stopped abruptly.She took one look at Psychke, and she looked at Verndia\u2019s feet.And she said awkwardly.\u201cYes.\u201dUnlike usual, she felt that Lia was distancing herself.Everything was usual before yesterday.\u2018Did they fight?\u2019Psychke identified Verndia with her squint.Even when Lia was in cold sweat, Verndia didn\u2019t care about her and asked a question.\u201cWhere can I get one?\u201d\u201cOver there.\u201dThe red-hat wizard chinned the dark brown wooden wall on the other side of the doorway.There were five doors lined up, numbered one through five.\u201cYou know the rules, right? Don\u2019t you know? Only one person can enter at a time. So, you decide who goes in.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a passage that connects materials to the place where they grow naturally. Dallua just needs to open and close the door to room 3 three times.\u201dPsychke wondered inwardly at the words she couldn\u2019t easily understand.Does she mean to go into room 3 to save Dallua? Due to the structure of the building, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a space behind the door.\u2018Should he use magic?\u2019As she was staring at door number 3 while thinking that, Verndia opened his mouth.\u201cIt would be nice if the Princess come. I want to go, but-\u201dHe casts his gaze at Lia, who helps make the neutralizer.He turned his head after meeting Lia\u2019s eyes.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dBecause he don\u2019t know what kind of play will these people do while he was gone.Actually, he didn\u2019t talk to Psychke, but he had been reading books on neutralizers all night. He wants to be prepared for any eventuality.The Wizard wearing a red hat, who misunderstood his words, was offended.\u201cYou are the first person to openly disbelieve in my medicine.\u201d\u201cI have its record so of course, I will be like this.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t even made a drug for you before. Look, I don\u2019t want to joke around. Princess, are you going with him?\u201dThe wizard\u2019s red eyes turned to Psychke.After lightly nodding her head in agreement, Psychke moved to door number three.\u201cOpen and close the door three times, then go at the fourth one. Then you can take it.\u201dAs the wizard said, she opened the door three times.At the first time, there was only a gray wall. But the second time, she was greeted with a sweet-smelling pink world. For the third time, she saw a sky-colored world with a refreshing smell.\u2018Amazing. I can use magic this way too.\u2019What kind of world is the fourth?Since it is said to be a yellow flower, would it be a golden world?Psychke turned the doorknob, imagining the scene that would unfold.Because of that, she didn\u2019t see the sudden black spark around her hand holding the doorknob.It was the moment she turned the doorknob for the fourth time.\u201c\u2026!\u201dShe didn\u2019t even force it, but the door was slammed open. She couldn\u2019t stand the unexpected strong force and was pushed away.A black gust of wind blew in from inside the door and threw the room into chaos.Papers floated and instruments tipped over, making a cracking sound here and there.The wizard, who held the table with one hand on the floor and the hat with the other, was startled.\u201cWhat have you done?!\u201d\u201cI just opened the door-\u201dThe backstory was unbearable. It was because a gust of wind shot around the room as if searching for something.\u201c\u2013!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t open her eyes because of the wind pressure that her body was pulled into the door and there was nothing she could hold to prevent herself be dragged inside.In the end, Psychke was helplessly dragged inside.\u201cPrincess!\u201dVerndia noticed her and swiftly ran up to her and reached out to her. However, a black gust of wind blocked the front like a barrier.Grinning at this, he raised a purple spark and suppressed the gust of wind.But at that moment, Psychke was completely dragged inside the door.Bang!The door closed completely with a loud sound.Verndia hastily opened the closed door.She was nowhere to be found. Not even a black gust blew like it did before.All he could see was the world that Psychke intended to go to, golden waves rustling in the breeze.His blue tendon was formed in his hand as he held the doorknob, distorting his expression.\u201cThe Princess, where did you send her to?\u201dUnintentionally, the vivid purple flesh pierced their lungs.The two wizards froze.* *Psychke waited for the wind to die down and opened her eyes.\u201cUgh.\u201dHer feet ached because she had been rolling lots of times and groaned.The first thing that caught her eye was a gray blade of grass, grotesquely distorted.\u2018What is this?\u2019This was the first time. She hadn\u2019t seen anything like this even in the botanical garden, which was said to have collected all the plants of the continent.She raised her gaze to look around her more to see where this was.The grass on the floor, the trees around her, the leaves on those trees, and even the sky above her head were all gray and grotesque.It was as if its vitality had been forcibly taken away.Looking around her surrounding like that, she stopped when she noticed something a little further away.\u201cA tombstone?\u201dShe headed to the tombstone.It was a gray tombstone, worn at the edges by the passage of time.However, it was not difficult to read the writing on the tombstone, and the clean writing seemed to have been maintained by someone on a regular basis.\u300cSilkisia Elizabeth, sleeps here.\u300dThe part behind the name was damaged as if scratched with a sharp object.A person who uses Silkisia as a first name rather than a last name.And the imperial castle, Elizabeth.\u2018Is she the first Silkisia?\u2019History books say that the tombstone of the first Silkisia does not exist, but why is it here?Is the tombstone of the first Silkisia correct?Psychke looked around for something other than the tombstone.But there was nothing but an endless gray world.\u2018Where is this really?\u2019She lifted her head, but didn\u2019t know where to go.As she was about to step trying to find the exit, creepy and eerie whispers from the tomb was heard.\u300c \u2026 Heid beware.\u201d \u300d\u2018A ghost?\u2019Chills ran down her spine.A person can be cut with a sword, but a ghost with no form cannot be cut with a sword which is even scarier. She grew pale and stepped back involuntarily.However,\u300c \u201cBeware of Adelheid.\u201d \u300dSomehow, the sound from the tomb grew louder even her distance from it had increased.At that moment, she pulled out her sword,\u201cOh, princess?\u201dA soft voice caught her attention.It was Shiona, with pink hair that reached her chest and orange eyes.She was grinning horribly as if this was a windfall.\u2018This.\u2019Psychke slightly frowned.Verndia\u2019s guess that Shiona was a worshipper with a brainwashing magic.She raised her sword and aimed it at Siona to ward off the ghost.Either that or not, Shiona showed no signs of being frightened.\u201c\u201dWhat are you doing here? This is what a holy place looks like so no one came come and go as she likes. I\u2019ve missed you so it\u2019s fine. Do you want to come over?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cA dangerous thing is of no use here, please come.\u201dShe pointed at the straightened sword and smiled at Shiona.But when Psychke wasn\u2019t listening, she looked off into the distance and sighed exaggeratedly.\u201cAh- I was trying to be peaceful, but it\u2019s not working.\u201dAnd she ran hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where are you going?!\u201dBang! Bang! As soon as Psychke stepped on the ground, a giant plant stem rose up.Ashen grass splashed in front of her and a cloud of dust floated in the air.Psychke ran madly without looking back.\u2018Even running is difficult. Why does my body feel stiff?\u2019She knew there\u2019s no way she can beat Shiona in this place.It was her realization after many exchanging of attacks.Her body felt heavy as if some heavy thing was hanging on it. Her ability hasn\u2019t been manifested that well, either.Even if she squeezed hard she could, all that came out was just a size of her fingernail.\u201cThere is no point in running away!\u201dSnake-like gray plant stems sprinted ferociously. Trees turned into monsters spread their branches in all directions.Because of them, her cheeks were scratched, even her clothes was torn, making a light scratch appear on her skin.Her hair, like a silvery thread, passed precariously between the branches.Psychke trampled the grass that kept tripping on her feet. With her sword, she cut off and slashed the plant stems that had grown thick like giant snakes.She continued to run, shaking off everything in her way, but a blue lake that suddenly appeared blocked her way.\u201cAcckk!\u201dIn an instant, the plant stem caught her limbs.Because of the unbearable pressure pushing her down, she lost her sword from her hand.Shiona, on the other hand, was leisurely walking sideways, watching Psychke suffer.She then grabbed her hair and forced her to look in her direction.\u201cHow have you been, Princess? I\u2019ve been having a hard time because of you, Princess!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stare at me with those eyes of yours! You\u2019re scared?\u201dShiona giggled like someone who have gone insane, covering her mouth with the back of her hand.\u201cAh, thanks to you, I\u2019ll sleep well tonight. But what the hell are you doing here? I can\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t answer me but it\u2019s also fine if you keep your mouth shut, anyway.\u201dShiona tapped Psyche\u2019s cheek as if she was dying of her cuteness.Then she saw the blue lake in front of her and laughed.\u201cYou have come a long way. When did you get here?\u201d\u201c\u2026 If you- kill me\u2026\u201dShe tried to kill her quickly.The plant\u2019s pressure on her was loosened.The pressure on her chest was gone, and Psychke quickly gasped for air, whilst her heart beat wildly.Shiona sneered at her.\u201cAh, my mistake. Since you kept running away, I put too much strength. But do not fret, I won\u2019t kill you. You seemed a bit injured, but if I fix you, I can use you again, so why would I kill you?\u201dWhat was she trying to say \u2018fix\u2019? Psychke bit her lips.The sword that turned into his earring touched her toe.Pulling it towards her, she twisted as hard as she could to free herself from the plant.However, since her strength was drained, she could only kick the grass, which had no effect. The lake swayed calmly.\u201cYou\u2019re cute. It\u2019s just that, you\u2019re useless\u2026 Ah.\u201dShiona twinkled her eyes, giggling after mocking Psychke.\u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re a curious person. Right now, what can you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cA lake, I was asking about it! Do you see anything like it?\u201dIt was just her and Shiona, pathetically stuck.Shiona mumbled when Psychke didn\u2019t respond.\u201cHmm, His Majesty kept saying something about the reincarnation of the first Silkisia, so I expected it, but was it just senility?\u201dThe moment she tried to retaliate fiercely at Shiona\u2019s words that she couldn\u2019t understand, Psychke\u2019s expression hardened.The lake started to stir, and Shiona disappeared.She was left alone, tied down in this unknown place.She collapsed on the white snow field and was crying in someone\u2019s arms.\u201cWhy, why? What do you see?\u201dThe changed Psychke\u2019s expression made Shiona more excited.Psychke looked down at herself reflected in the water.Looking closely, she realized that the woman reflected in the water was not herself. It looked similar to her face but gotten older.\u2018This face is something I haven\u2019t seen before.\u2019\u300c \u201c\u2026. Les\u2026\u201d \u300dSuddenly, a sound came from the lake.It was a dying voice.\u300c \u201c\u2026 Me, Lestir.\u201d \u300dIt was a sound right in front of her, but it echoed as if speaking from afar.Just then, she remembered where she had seen this face.\u2018The First Silkisia.\u2019She saw this face in a room filled of portraits of the successive family heads.That woman who looked like herself was the original Silkisia.\u300c \u201cKill me, Lestir\u2026\u201d \u300dAlong with the gloomy words, the water shadows shimmered.Then, it returned to a normal lake.\u201cTell me. What do you see?\u201dShiona, who couldn\u2019t hear the lake\u2019s voice, was anxious. She asked to speak quickly and pulled out her dagger and she even held it.Even so, Psychke did not hesitate once.She had no idea what was it, but she didn\u2019t want to do what other person wanted.It was Shiona who sweated.\u201cAh, it looks like you can see something.\u201dShe bit her pouty lips with her nervous face.Is His Majesty right? I think he is. Then I am a mighty wizard who cast a brainwashing spell on the first Silkisian\u2026?\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll have to find out for myself, then.\u201dRetrieving her dagger, Shiona tore her palm without hesitation.Then she covered Psychke\u2019s face with her bloody palms.\u201cI\u2019m going to do a little memory searching to confirm, so listen carefully and I\u2019ll be done in no time!\u201d\u201cWhat? Wait!\u201dPsychke couldn\u2019t even finish her words when the darkness engulfed her instantly. She had lost her consciousness.* * *\u201c\u2026 Psychke, Psychke.\u201dWhen Psychke opened her eyes, she was back to when she was ten years old.She was in the Training Hall of Silkisia.As a child, she threw down her wooden sword and bowed down in front of Logan, who was enraged.\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\u201cIn order to become a true Silkisia\u2026 You said, that I\u2026 I must not defeat my older brother, Yzhar.\u201dBefore she could figure out what the situation was, her mouth opened on its own. Her little body trembled with fear.\u201cThat\u2019s right! But you-\u201dA cold gaze dug into her back.The little Psychke wanted to say, \u2018It was my fault, I won\u2019t do it again.\u2019However, the Psychke of reality prevented it.\u2018No, you won\u2019t let me off no matter what I do. You just won\u2019t admit.\u2019\u201cPsychke?\u201dAs if her unresponsiveness was strange, Logan let out an accusing voice.Her body trembled even more.She have to answer right now, she needed to answer, because if she don\u2019t she\u2019ll get scolded real bad.\u2018No. Don\u2019t answer him.\u2019She knew that this is just an illusion created by Shiona\u2019s magic, but this was her irreversible past.But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t let it go the way it did.Whether she was useful or not, wrongdoing has to be corrected.\u2018I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u2019Psychke of reality fought fiercely with her inner fear.Perhaps because of that, what came out of young Psychke\u2019s mouth, which slowly opened, was a different sentence from the past.\u201c\u2026 Want to.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI do not want to.\u201dShe raised her head and looked at Logan.His face was even more contorted.\u201cDo you know what you are talking about?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t I beat my brother?\u201d\u201cIt looks like you really don\u2019t want to become Silkisia.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need anything like the real Silkisia.\u201dSaid little Psychke in a clear voice.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be Silkisia.\u201dLogan\u2019s expression darkened.At the same time, Shiona\u2019s voice, which seemed to echo in the distance, grumbled.\u2018She completely lost herself. I need to wake her up and repeat.\u2019Logan and the training hall were shattered by the darkness that spread as if it were scattering.It felt as if something weighing heavily on her head was breaking.And the scene changed.It was a dungeon.Psychke was lying on her face in front of someone. She was younger than earlier. Her whole body was bound with chains.She was about to get up however, she didn\u2019t have the strength to do she intended, and she stiffened her body startled by the voice that came from right in front of her.\u201cAre you sure you want to save her?\u201dHer father\u2019s voice was colder than ever.In the primal fear that she might be strangled at any moment, young Psychke lowered her posture. Iron, the chains scratched the floor.\u201cAre you concerned?\u201dA dry voice answered. It was the first voice she heard.\u201cAre you afraid this kid will take your place? There will be no such thing. As long as she does her job well.\u201dHis cold hand jerked her head.Psychke could finally see the people in front of her.It was her father, Shiona, and a red-haired, gray-eyed man bent over and grabbing her hair.The moment she faced him, her body seemed to freeze.His eyes were so cold that Psychke trembled involuntarily. She tried hard to avert her gaze but he forced him too look into him.\u201cHe\u2019s the person who will be your master, so keep an eye on him.\u201d\u2018What is this memory?\u2019She had never heard like this in her childhood. Was this memory even correct?Psychke twisted her body, trying to refute him.However, only the unknown fear filled up, and her mouth did not open at all.At some point, her tears flowed.The man, who let her go, commanded Shiona.\u201cStart. Don\u2019t forget to recognize it as a curse so that she can\u2019t use her superpowers at will.\u201dWhat\u2026\u201cYes.\u201dShiona, who pouted her mouth, squatted in front of Psychke and covered it with her hand from forehead to the tip of her nose.Psychke didn\u2019t like the touch, letting out a heavy breath.Suddenly, memories of her that she knew came flooding in.People who shouted that her ability is a curse, people said that there will be a bloodshed-You said this was all made up of memories?\u2018I have to get out.\u2019She struggled to escape the spell.However, her hardened body did not intend to move.\u2018This is a curse. It shouldn\u2019t be known to anyone!\u2019\u2018If it is known that this child is alive, there will be bloodshed in the empire.\u2019Her fabricated fake memories blinded her eyes.She thought her vision turned blurred but what was in front of her turned black, chains that restrained her body disappeared along with the cold prison.Even the cool air that touched her skin was nowhere to be found.She can\u2019t see nor hear anything.Her world has become a complete nothingness.Then, since when.Strange letters started appearing. She heard a ringing hum from afar, encroaching on her eyes and ears.\u300c \u201cDon\u2019t use your abilities.\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cYour ability is nothing like supernatural powers. It\u2019s a curse.\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cGo back.\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cThe only place that accepts someone like you is Silkisia. Go back.\u201d \u300dPsychke closed her eyes and covered her ears.No. Even though she doesn\u2019t know where she should be, she doesn\u2019t think she belongs to Silkisia.They don\u2019t accept me there. Whatever she does, they just don\u2019t want to admit it.\u300c \u201cGo back.\u201d .\u300dNo. No!I was floating on the edge of unconsciousness, struggling to resist the words that felt like a command.\u2018Why, where are you going?\u2019Someone\u2019s words echoed in her head.As if drawing a scene with colored threads on a black background, the situation at that time appeared, disappeared, and appeared repeatedly.She sat down in front of her, then disappeared.\u2018Where are you going?\u2019She couldn\u2019t say anything to those purple eyes that were burning like they were about to swallow her.In fact, she hadn\u2019t even decided on a destination, but even if she had, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell.\u2018Tell me. Huh?\u2019Psychke muttered involuntarily.She didn\u2019t notice that her numb mouth started to move.\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\u201cJust make up your mind. I\u2019ll burn you for real.\u201d\u2026 Ha, have she ever heard something like this in real life?Her head turned sluggishly.It was Shiona\u2019s scream filled with pain that awakened her.\u201cKkyaahh!!\u201dThe senses that had returned one by one came back all at once, like a candle being lit in a dark room.Returning to the boundary of consciousness, Psychke opened her eyes.At that moment, the world of silence was shattered.Bang!\u201cAaaaagh-!\u201dThe acrid smell of smoke stung her nostrils. Shiona\u2019s screams bursting out incessantly pierced her eardrums.Her head hurt and she couldn\u2019t balance her drained body. If she hadn\u2019t had someone hugging her, she would have fallen to the floor.Her vision was blurry because she was out of focus. All she could see was something blue floating everywhere.Judging by the rushing heat, she guessed that it was a spark.\u2026 Wait a moment. A \u2018blue\u2019 flame?(TN: Giirll, your man saved you~)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a voice so familiar that she felt empty without hearing.\u201cDuke?\u201dWith no energy, she managed to squeeze her voice out.He changed the way his eyes looked ferocious before looking down at her.The way his fluctuating blue eyes stared at her felt strange. Is she really out of her mind that her vision turned blurry?He stared at the woman he almost lost again with a face full of emotion, then he let out a relieved sigh and asked,\u201cAre you okay?\u201dIf the case was that the Wizards gathered a bit later, he would have blown the association up.They couldn\u2019t figure out why the door caused the error or where Psychke had gone.However, they calmed down the rampaging mad dog and summoned Psychke back, saying that it was possible to reverse summon because there were traces left.However, even if she came back intact, she was with trash.They were called back together because they were in contact with the body during brainwashing.His hands tightened as she embraced her fianc\u00e9e. Verndia called out to Psychke again, who did not answer.\u201cAre you okay? Rielle?\u201dHe was anxious because he did not know how far Siona\u2019s brainwashing had progressed.He was in much distraught that he even called her with her real name, which he found out from the forbidden magic.To alleviate that anxiety, Psychke responded with all her might.Likewise, she didn\u2019t know that he called her \u2018Rielle\u2019 because she was losing her mind.\u201cYes, I am all right\u2026\u201dShe badly wanted to get up but her eyelids were closing on their own. Memories buried in darkness poured down like a waterfall.\u2018And Logan, you\u2019re in charge of this child.\u2019\u2018They say that her ability won\u2019t manifest unless they\u2019re in a normal environment.\u2019\u2018Her ability only needs manifestation so, other than that, I won\u2019t get involved in anything.\u2019It was an unintended result, but the magic hanging over Psychke was completely broken.It was Verndia who attacked Shiona, who brainwashed Psychke, then forced her to dispel the magic.As a reaction, the faded memories were running in reverse.\u2018\u2026 Run, nanny. Don\u2019t ever get caught!\u2019\u2018Run away, young lady!\u2019\u2018Ahhh!\u2019Her mother, who went to the birthday banquet of Her Highness, the Crown Princess, never returned.Her father, who had gone with her, ran into her mansion covered in blood,Her nanny ran away with her, but was attacked and killed by an assailant.So she knelt and begged for her life to the person who killed her nanny.\u2018Sa, save me. Please, help me\u2026\u2019Her tears flowed out of her eyes.\u201cWake up. Riyel, Riyel!\u201d\u201cAagh!\u201dPsychke fell into a deep sleep, leaving behind her cries in reality, not knowing whether it was Verndia or Shiona.* * *\u201cPrincess, where are you!\u201d\u201cMadam is looking for you. Come out quickly!\u201dIt was a summer day when roses of various colors were in full bloom in the green flower garden.A child who was hiding in the grass of a flower bed, avoiding those who were busy searching for her, slightly and slowly lifted her head. Her finely braided silver hair was stained with leaves nearby her.Adding to that her dress was crumpled with dirt.At first glance, it was Psychke, a cute three-year-old girl who seemed to have been loved and raised.\u201cHehe.\u201dLittle Psychke came out of the grass, babbling, as if it she was in so much. In her hand contained a teddy bear half her size. She toddled in the opposite direction where her employees had disappeared.She became tired of walking, so she took the teddy bear\u2019s hand as if it was her friend\u2019s hand.The dragged part of her doll\u2019s bottom started to get dirty, and she didn\u2019t even know it.On the way, Psychke stopped in front of a flower bed with many roses. She was entranced by its beauty then stretched her hand to pluck the red rose.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t catch the thorny part of it, but the stem was tough, and she couldn\u2019t take it no matter how hard she tried which made her groan in frustration. Just then, something purple flashed in front of her eyes, and that flower part burned in an instant.\u201c\u2026?\u201dNo matter how many times she rubbed her eyes, and checking the rose, the burnt rose didn\u2019t return. Where did it go?\u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201dPsychke blankly stared at the rose, with the only stem remained. She then turned her head to the sound of her voice coming from the side.\u201cHi.\u201dHe had black hair and purple eyes. He was the first boy she had ever seen.It seemed that the clothes he was wearing were quite classy and noble.The boy was embarrassed as if he had done something wrong.But she didn\u2019t catch Psychke\u2019s eye.She blinked only a few times in her enlarged eyes, turned her head around, and reached out for another rose from that plant.Burn!The purple sparkled and the rose was burnt again. Psychke blinked and reached for another rose. Then burn! The boy burnt it again.\u201cWaah\u2026\u201dPsychke didn\u2019t know what it was but it felt so much fun so she opened her mouth in astonishment.She put her teddy bear down and moved vigorously, and the speed of burning the rose increased, correspondingly to her movements. Fire, fire, fire.Frightened by the smell of something burning, the employees started running, but without knowing it, they fell in love with burning roses.She stopped doing that after all the roses she could touch had disappeared from where she was now.\u2018I should go somewhere else and do more.\u2019Wanting to change her place, Psychke picked up the teddy bear she had put down.She was about to pick it up.Burn! The teddy bear turned to ashes and disappeared.\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke\u2019s eyes widened.As she stared down at her empty hands, her smile disappeared in surprise, and the dark-haired child realized something was wrong with her.She tried to help the cute kid pluck flowers and accidentally burned them. But the kid was having so much fun so he thought he should give her that fun.But she guessed that the teddy bear shouldn\u2019t be burned.\u2018What should I do?\u2019The child approached the girl who looked around her in search of her teddy bear.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d\u201cBear\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ch been burnt.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. It\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cDead. Now I can\u2019ch see it anymow.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen she said that she wouldn\u2019t be able to see her bear again, her blue eyes filled with tears.\u201cHng\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHhhnnnngggg!\u201dPsychke began to weep profusely, like a person who had lost the world.Should he have said the bear went home, and not dead?Unable to do this or that, the dark-haired child became stiff.* *\u201cNice to meet you, this is Verndia Lestir.\u201d\u201cHhhnnggg-\u201dUncharacteristically for a six-year-old, her gentle voice was drowned out by whimpering cries.\u201cThe bear-\u201dA white and elegant table, four chairs, light refreshments, and drinks for children.It was a place prepared in the backyard to welcome her precious guest.Her blonde hair was elegantly curled up, and her eyes resembled emeralds.The gentle-looking Leas greeted him by hugging and comforting her sobbing daughter.\u201cHng, hnnggg-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke. My daughter is usually not like this. You\u2019re a good girl [Psychke], right?\u201dIt must have been quite shocking that the teddy bear disappeared in front of her eyes.She tried bringing other dolls, but she cried even harder and didn\u2019t try to pick them up.Leas patted her daughter on the back as she cried her lungs out.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I feel more apologetic because of what happened.\u201dDuchess Lestir let out a deep sigh.She knew that her son had used superpowers from the smoke that bloomed and the witnesses of the employees.\u201cI told you not to use it anywhere you want.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mother. Unlike the north, it\u2019s too hot. I tried to hold it in, but it came out on its own.\u201dAt Verndia\u2019s excuse, Duchess Lestir\u2019s complexion darkened.It was because she remembered the high priest\u2019s words during the evaluation ceremony, saying that his ability was so strong that he would be swallowed up by flames at this rate.Just in time, Psychke\u2019s cries subsided, and Duchess Lestir asked quietly.She had been friends with her even before they got married, so she had no sense of distance.\u201cIs there any news about your daughter?\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cThe evaluation ceremony.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still a three years old.\u201dThe evaluation could be received only when the child was at least five years old.Even knowing that the Duchess of Lestir let out her impatience.\u201cStill, there is an if. I\u2019ve heard that there are rare cases where the ability before the Evaluation Ceremony is released.\u201d\u201cYes, I hope so.\u201dA sad smile crept across Leas\u2019s lips.She also knew about Verndia\u2019s circumstances.If her ability does not appear in Silkisia, Verndia has a high probability that he will not reach adulthood and die.\u201cMom, Mom.\u201dPsychke, who had stopped crying before she knew it, called her mother and twisted her body.Leas bowed her head slightly towards her daughter. Then her soft fingers touched her green eyes.If Leas hadn\u2019t ducked, she would have been stabbed in the eye.\u201cHe is doing it again.\u201dWhile she was ordering her lady-in-waiting to bring her something, the bewildered Duchess Lestir opened her mouth.\u201cHave you not broken that habit yet?\u201dShe seems to have said in a letter she received a few months ago that her daughter kept poking her in the eye.Leas laughed embarrassedly.\u201cIt\u2019s not going well.\u201d\u201cWell, my Verndia\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I did?\u201d\u201cThis is so old-fashioned. If it had cute flavors, it\u2019s delicious.\u201dThe whining, which was lightly continued, soon became a central issue.Duchess Lestir grumbled.\u201cYou mean the birthday banquet for Her Highness the Crown Princess. I don\u2019t know what to give her.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried too.\u201dLeas let out a light sigh, and her handmaid approached.As her mistress had commanded, she held out a gold necklace with a large emerald on it.Psychke, who even then tried to gouge out her eyes at every opportunity, calmed down as soon as she gave her necklace.Duchess Lestir was curious about the identity of the object that made the troublemaker calm.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a necklace. She liked it because it was the same color as my eyes.\u201dLeas lowered her daughter from her lap to the empty chair next to her.Psychke did not take her eyes off the necklace. Not paying attention to the chatter of her mother and her mother\u2019s friends, she played well by herself.However, the boy sitting across from her kept talking to her and being annoying.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou little rat-bean.\u201d\u201cI am natch a rat-bean!\u201dI don\u2019t know what rats were, but it didn\u2019t sound like a compliment.She protested and jumped out of the chair. She quickly moved to a place where the troublesome boy couldn\u2019t go.However, she couldn\u2019t go far and sat down on the floor at her mother\u2019s words.\u201cYou can\u2019t go far.\u201d\u201cYesh.\u201dSo, while she was playing with the emerald in her necklace, a shade fell over her head.Psychke didn\u2019t even look up.And Verndia, the only son of a high-ranking duke, felt unfamiliar with the disregard he had experienced for the first time in his life.\u2018What is this?\u2019(TN: So, when they were young, Verndia was a tease and attention seeker type? HAHA, cute.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Verndia looked down at his fingers.Her cheeks felt soft and chubby. He wanted to do more.So, he did.Poke.\u201cSichap [Stop].\u201dPoke.\u201cSichap.\u201dPoke.\u201cSichap\u2026\u201dPoke.\u201cHhhngg\u2026.\u201dOh, she\u2019s about to cry again. Is she a rat or a crybaby? He gave her the necklace that slipped out of her hand, and after living six years, he spoke in the most affectionate voice.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, rat-bean.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m natch a rat-bean\u2026.\u201dHe comforted her, but why did she end up crying?Verndia stared blankly at Psychke, grabbed her by the wrist on the side that wasn\u2019t holding the necklace, and swung it toward him.Tak, there was a light sound when Psychke\u2019s hand and his head met.He repeated the same thing several more times, pretending to be in pain.\u201cOuch, ow. Ouch.\u201dPsychke\u2019s eyes, which were sparkling with tears, were filled with curiosity. The kid who was bullying her was in pain!\u201cDo you want more?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith a vigorous nod, Verndia let go of her hand.He grabbed her necklace and tried to wield it, so she didn\u2019t forget to snatch it away.Psychke vigorously waved her fern-like hand.\u201cBad.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019m bad, rat-bean.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m natch a rat-bean.\u201d\u201cThen what are you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019ch know.\u201d\u201cAh, a Rat-bean Silkisia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a rat-bean!\u201dHit, hit, hit. Strength went into her feeble hands.\u201cYou are really strong. Later, you will use a sword very well.\u201d\u201cYesh, I\u2019m shtrong.\u201d\u201cYou are a rat-bean.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m natch a rat-bean!\u201d\u201cYeah, Rat-bean Silkisia.\u201dEnraged, Psyche swung her fists wildly. He feigned pain and returned every one of his cotton-bat-like punches. Despite the fact that it was his first time being hit by someone, it doesn\u2019t feel bad.\u201cYou are really cute.\u201d\u201cYesh, I\u2019m cute.\u201d\u201cDo you know what it means to be cute?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShe only knew that it meant well because her mom, dad, and employees laughed whenever they saw her. Her slapping hand weakened hearing that certain word since she was blown away by his praise.In the meantime, Verndia held her hands tightly so that she wouldn\u2019t hit him again, and asked with a subtlety that was not appropriate for her age.\u201cRat-bean, should I give you something good?\u201d\u201cGood?\u201dWhen he said that it was good, the words she was trying to say went well.Her blue eyes shone brightly.\u201cWhat ish it?\u201dInstead of answering, he took something out of his pocket.A pair of silver rings shone beautifully under the bright sunlight. It wasn\u2019t Lestir\u2019s heirloom, but it was a ring with a similar meaning to an heirloom.\u201cOh my, look at him!\u201dThe noisy kids became quiet because they were watching something.Surprised by her son\u2019s unexpected behavior, the Duchess of Lestir came running in fright.\u201cWhere did you learn all this?\u201dShe took the ring her son was holding.Fortunately for her, it was before he could put it in Psychke\u2019s ring.\u201cDuke is six-years old, right?\u201dLeas, who followed belatedly, asked dumbfounded.No matter where you look at that, he\u2019s six years old. Even if he\u2019s twenty-six wearing a six-year-old guy, she was in disbelief.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either.\u201dThe Duchess of Lestir has denied her son\u2019s age.\u201cMom, Mom.\u201dOnly Psychke, who had almost been promised a future, pulled the hem of her mother\u2019s skirt in the clear sun while pointing at Verndia with her other hand.\u201cHe wanched to give me someching good but he didn\u2019ch.\u201d\u201cShall I give it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cVerndia!\u201dEmbarrassed, the Duchess threw her face away.She stopped her son from taking the silver ring through her inattention.\u201cMy apologies. My son is immature.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have it, but I think it\u2019s because I heard too much.\u201dEven then, Psyche always gave her nice things, staring at Berndia with sparkling eyes.he shrugged her shoulders.\u201cI can\u2019t, sorry.\u201d\u201cHhhnngg-\u201d\u201cStop crying. I\u2019ll give it to you later. If you cry, I won\u2019t give it to you later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 When?\u201d\u201cWell, when you\u2019re not a rat-bean anymore.\u201d\u201cI am not a rat-bean.\u201d\u201cThen what are you?\u201d\u201cWhat am I? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re a rat-bean.\u201d\u201cI told choo am not\u2026!\u201dHit, hit, hit. After releasing the hem of her mother\u2019s skirt, Psychke hit Verndia.Leas was surprised to see her daughter\u2019s violent turn.\u201cRielle! You should not do that!\u201d\u201cI cannot?\u201d\u201cYes. You must not hit oppa [Pertaining to Verndia. Used to say when a male is older than you for a few years].\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s bad. Can you say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 to oppa?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m chorry-\u201dAs her mother ordered, Psychke bowed her head towards him and made short tongue sounds.Verndia pretended not to know that he didn\u2019t know she was going to hit him.\u201cIf you\u2019re sorry, then tell me your name.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t wanch.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not sorry even though I am hurt.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m chorry.\u201d\u201cThen you have to tell me.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because the pronunciation is difficult. Rielle, can your mother tell me for you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dPsychke rejected his suggestion again and again.She thought that she has to tell him that she is not a Rat Silkisia later on.\u201cYou\u2019re stubborn, rat-bean.\u201dVerndia pulled her chubby cheeks lightly.Psychke opened her eyes wide. Even so, the problem was that she seemed cute to Verndia.(TN: Aiya, so he\u2019s already in love with her ever since they were young.)\u201cSichap.\u201dHe laughed out loud at the muffled pronunciation. Oh, why is she so cute?He was thinking of inviting them to come to the north, but he swallowed the \u2018Taboo of Silkisia\u2019 he had heard before coming here and said something else instead.\u201cAre you going to tell me next time?\u201d\u201cYesh.\u201d\u201cDo I have to study hard to say your name?\u201d\u201cYesh.\u201dPsychke nodded her head with a determined face.Next time she sees him, she must tell him. So that she wouldn\u2019t be teased as rat.No one would have known that the next meeting would be 20 years later.***She was not in her right mind because she was asleep for a long time. She blinked her eyes slowly while lying on the bed in a dark room. She felt her tears run down from her cheeks to behind her ears.A rustle of people could be heard from the other side.As she looked towards them, she saw Verndia sleeping uncomfortably in the chair.The twitching of his eyelids did not indicate that he was in a deep sleep.\u2018Rat-bean Silkisia.\u2019Because he had appeared in her childhood dream a little while ago, his teasing of her lingered in her ears.The scene was so vivid, as if it were yesterday, not 20 years ago.She stared at him and stood up. Her nightgown had a brooch that retook her body size.After all, it must have been difficult to take care of a small body.Looking at it like this, the child Verndia seemed to overlap with the present Verndia.Psychke slowly reached out her hand toward the sleeping man.She didn\u2019t even know why or what she was trying to do.Verndia, who opened his eyes, took her hand.\u201cYou woke up. Your body?\u201d\u201cI feel fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dWith a deep voice, he caressed her cheek.Only then did Psychke realize that she was crying.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rielle.\u201dShe finally remembered what she was like when she was young, what expression she was making at that time, and what emotions she felt.Because of what happened, he took her body and hugged her tightly.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dLike Leas did 20 years ago, he patted her crying back and comforted her.Her memories which were locked under the influence of forbidden magic had returned so he thought her memories would have returned as well.Judging by her cries, that guess seemed correct.\u201cI will help you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Rielle.\u201dA body temperature higher than that of others wrapped around her body. It felt so warm that it made her cry even more.\u201cDuke.\u201dPsychke deliberately called Verndia a title that felt distant.It was a quiet, yet unquivering voice.\u201cIf you call me like that, please do it when everything is over.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHearing that name now\u2026\u201dMy heart hurts so much.It\u2019s so miserable and shabby to be called by that name without solving anything\u2026\u201cWhen I get everything back, I\u2019ll get that name back too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Okay. I will.\u201dVerndia agreed. He turned his tone down, wanting to distance her as he wanted.However, he badly wanted to tell her this.\u201cI like you. I loved you at first sight. I like you, Glorielle.\u201d\u201cYou know my name?\u201d\u201cI asked my mother that day. I couldn\u2019t stand my curiosity.\u201dAt the mention of that day, she burst into laugh. Ahaha, Psychke laughed along with tears of happiness.\u201cStop crying. Then and now, Princess cries a lot.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stop my tears.\u201d\u201cBecause the princess doesn\u2019t express her emotions too much\u2026. I never said it was bad to see you cry. But it is better to laugh, if possible.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dShe wanted to laugh as he said. She forced the corner of her mouth to curve, yet her tears just couldn\u2019t stop. She forced herself to smile but her body was trembling.At that slight trembling, Verndia let out a sigh of his own.Feelings that were not allowed to him, who lost his parents at a young age and became the family head.However, through Psychke, he tasted the feelings without want.Now he felt that emotion clearly through the ring that shared their emotion.At times like this, he was grateful that the ring had the ability to share emotions.Even if you use all the expressions in the world, there will be no words to express this sadness.He wanted to comfort her, but he was far from being soft. So, as usual, he took his shot. When he told her not to cry because she was upset, he was really dumbfounded by his stupidity.\u201cJust cry. What are you holding back, like an idiot?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ugh.\u201dThe tears she was trying to stop somehow finally burst. Psychke eventually burst into tears.That day she cried all night.She wept endlessly as if she were trying to let out all the emotions she hadn\u2019t poured out in 20 years.***Recently, there have been three hot topics in the Empire.The first was Verndia Lestir and his blue flame, who blew up the Magic Association out of the blue.The second was a terrifying oracle that the emperor would change,The third was a rumor that Glorielle Silkisia, the daughter of Leas Silkisia and a candidate for the oracle, was alive and would appear at the Prince\u2019s forthcoming coming-of-age banquet.(TN: THE CONFESSION FINALLY HAPPENED!!

She was about to tell a very interesting story with other ladies.\u201cThat Leah\u2019s daughter is alive.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dThe faces of all those attending the tea party were stained with disbelief.Among them, the oldest lady spoke as a representative.\u201cIf she\u2019s the daughter of Leas\u2019s, then are you talking about Glorielle?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThere are very interesting rumors going around.\u201dThe lady smiled a little.Glorielle was said to be already dead at the time when Leas\u2019 case took place.Her body was never found, but the body of the nanny she had fled with was found mutilated, and she was presumed dead and forgotten.\u201cHow can she still be alive when it was said she\u2019s dead?\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dThe countess\u2019s daughter tilted her head, agreeing with the lady\u2019s opinion.\u201cBut it overlapped with the oracle, so this feels somewhat uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it\u2026\u201dA few days ago, two oracles that came down after 285 years were announced throughout the empire.According to the official who announced the oracle, it has not been decided which oracle to follow and which to remove.Without doubt, the first one would be eliminated as it was related to the Emperor.\u201cWas the first oracle said, \u2018Glory that has lost its light will live and eat the light of the sun\u2019?\u201d\u201cThere was a saying that it had something to do with the name.\u201d\u201cThen, what is \u2018Glory that has lost its light\u2019\u2026\u201dThe hall became quiet.It\u2019s because everyone thought the same thing at the same time.\u300c Glorielle Silkisia, who has lost everything, will return to punish the emperor. \u300dThose gathered here were supporters of the crown prince, but that didn\u2019t mean they were happy with Glorielle\u2019s return.In any case, since Glorielle was the daughter of someone who rebelled against the imperial family, one could not guess what kind of relationship she would have with the crown prince.\u201cIt must be just a rumor.\u201dSomeone threw a word to evoke the sunken atmosphere.The young lady sitting across from her shrugged her shoulders.\u201cIndeed. It must be a story that someone who heard the oracle made up for fun.\u201d\u201cBut what if she\u2019s really alive?\u201dThe Countess\u2019s daughter, who hosted the tea party, rolled her eyes.\u201cThe rumors were too specific to be moderately made up.\u201d\u201cWas it too specific?\u201d\u201cThey said she would appear at the coming-of-age banquet for the upcoming 2nd Prince.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEveryone froze at the sudden, unexpected words, including the young lady who dismissed it as a \u2018funny rumor\u2019. The young lady of the Marquis urgently asked a question. She was the first to wake up from the shock.\u201cWho did you hear that from?\u201d\u201cUm, well, you know.\u201dThe young lady of the count winked slightly. It meant that she did not want to tell the source of the rumors.Usually, the providers of interesting information shut their mouths so as not to reveal their information, so it was polite to hide their identity if they wanted to continue to hear information.Knowing that, the Marquis\u2019s daughter did not ask further questions. She only stared at the young lady of the count with a meaningful gaze.The lady made it simple.\u201cThen it will soon become clear whether the rumors are true.\u201dThose in the tea party nodded in agreement.That\u2019s when the chatter about Glorielle finally subsided.A bright young lady pressed herself close to the table with sparkling eyes and changed the subject.\u201cAh, did you all hear this? The fact that Duke Lestir burned the Magic Association!\u201d\u201cAh yes. I heard but isn\u2019t it quieter than expected? I don\u2019t think I heard that the association protested against the duke.\u201d\u201cThey must be fighting internally. Or maybe the association doesn\u2019t want to fight back because of the Duke\u2019s blue flame.\u201d\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it the first time since the invitation that Lestir\u2019s flame color has changed?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But from what I know that he can only use it when he have a person with the ability of Silkisia?\u201dAt the young lady\u2019s remark, the hall became quiet again.She began to ruminate on the contents of the history book in her head.Lestir\u2019s blue flame is said to be more powerful than the purple flame.However, only the first Lestir could use the blue flame.Several generation who asked about this after the first Lester died, will only hear the same answer of,\u2018I can\u2019t use it because I don\u2019t have the ability of Silkisia.\u2019Since the invitation, Silkisia and Lestir\u2019s abilities have never been born in the same generation.In other words, the fact that Lestir used the blue flame means that there are people with abilities in Silkisia.One of the young ladies who organized her thoughts carefully asked.\u201cThen, are you saying that Princess Lillian is a person with powers?\u201d\u201cI never heard that she went to her discernment process.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I heard that.\u201dA young lady who had been listening quietly until now raised her hand.\u201cPrincess Lillian received the judgment ceremony, but the color of the holy water had changed.\u201dFor a moment, everyone gasped.One of them shouted something of amazement or lamentation.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not the case, it\u2019s hard to keep Silkisia in check after the duke got engaged.\u201d\u201cPrincess Lillian is a talented person, so it\u2019s going to be even more difficult in the future.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t that a bit strange?\u201dThe young lady who brought up the story of Lillian\u2019s discernment ceremony for the first time blinked her eyes wide.\u201cWhy was it so quiet? That\u2019s enough for everyone to gossip about.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dThe daughter he found after 20 years is said to be the first person to appear in several generations.Silkisia, who should be talking here and there, was strangely quiet.\u201cDidn\u2019t there be any mention of a person with abilities appearing in the temple?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you\u2019re distracted by the oracle?\u201d\u201cWell. Anyway, I should have said it\u2019s about the ability and not the oracle.\u201d\u201cPrincess Lillian didn\u2019t say much either.\u201d\u201cUmm, is there a reason for her to do so?\u201d\u201cI guess so. If we wait, she might announce something.\u201dIn the Discriminant Ceremony, only those with abilities can change the color of the holy water.So they didn\u2019t bother to raise the suspicion that was creeping in.Except for one person, the countess\u2019s daughter, who hosted the tea party.\u201cIt\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to do it, but it\u2019s that she cannot, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard it at a tea party, and not just me, but everyone in the room heard it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt was not a false rumor because it was said by the Duke of Silkisia himself.The eyes of the noble lady and the young ladies widened.\u201cReally, what?\u201d\u201cWhat could be the reason of not telling the result of it? It\u2019s not like Princess Lillian\u2019s result was incompetent.\u201dShe was busy guessing the reason for each.In the meantime, a young lady timidly mumbled.\u201cBy the way, if Princess Lillian isn\u2019t a person with powers, then who is the person with powers in Silkisia?\u201dThe hall became quiet again.As long as you used \u2018Blue Flame\u2019 in Lestir, there are definitely people with abilities in Silkisia.But unless Lillian is a talented person.\u2018No way.\u2019The majority who reached similar conclusions froze.In their behalf, the elegant lady stammered uncharacteristically.\u201cCouldn\u2019t it be Glorielle?\u201d* * *Around that time, the shouts of the head of the house resonated beyond Silkisia every day.\u201cWho else did what?\u201dEven today, the corridors that were filled with the employees near the Duke\u2019s office, held their breath.The butler, whose only crime was to convey the wandering words, broke into a cold sweat at the sharp gaze.\u201cWhat did Lillian do?\u201d\u201cRumors are spreading that she was the owner of \u2018Unmelting Ice.\u201d\u201cDid she spread it himself?\u201d\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s what Prince Lenox said.\u201dWith sad blue eyes, the butler stammered involuntarily.Lenox, slapping Baron Hillace on the cheek wasn\u2019t enough, so what kind of accident did he do?Logan gritted his molars to suppress the rising anger.\u201cWhy would Lenox say that?\u201d\u201cFrom what I understood, the Duke of Lestir\u2019s usage of the Blue Flame not too long ago has led to the appearance of a Silkisia\u2019s ability, however..\u201dThe butler, whose eyes were getting fiercer, tried to report while his voice was sinking.\u201cSince the young lady has never used her superpowers or received a discernment ceremony, it seems strange to people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was even a rumor that Leas\u2019 daughter was alive, so it was said that she had her superpowers-\u201dBang!At the word Leas\u2019 daughter, Logan slammed the desk as if it wanting to break.The butler quickly shut his mouth, but he knew that he hadn\u2019t answered the Duke\u2019s question yet, so he looked at his eyes and continued.\u201cAnyway, it seems that Master Lenox was very upset about that. So, the Duke said that Princess Lillian received the discernment ceremony, and that he saw the color of the holy water change with his own eyes-\u201d\u201cHe have gone crazy.\u201dLogan gnashed his teeth at the words that sounded like he would faint.\u201cHe\u2019s so d*mn crazy!\u201dHis fists against the desk trembled with rage.Only one family member of ability exists at the same time.In other words, as long as Psychke has the ability, Lillian cannot become one, no matter what.But what does it mean when the color of the holy water had changed?\u2018It can\u2019t be. Something\u2019s definitely wrong.\u2019Until he heard from the butler, he didn\u2019t even know that Lillian had been given a discernment ceremony.It was absurd to think that Lenox didn\u2019t even mention anything to his father about something to so important.\u2018Maybe Lenox was wrong. She may not have been given the result of the ceremony.\u2019Logan barely swallowed the rage directed at his stupid son, Lennox.He kicked off his seat with a glimmer of hope and ran through the hallway.And he threw open the door to his daughter\u2019s room without knocking.\u201cFa, father?\u201dLillian, who was fiddling with something with a gloomy expression, was stunned.She hurriedly hid she had touched in her trinket box before she greeted him.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe familiar green light shimmered in the sunlight that came through the window.However, Logan, who was distracted, did not see it.\u201cI was told you were given a discernment ceremony. How did the result come out?\u201d\u201cTh, that.\u201d\u201cTell me right now. Before I go to the temple myself and ask.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It was black.\u201dIt was not enough to receive that ceremony, yet on the top of that, the result was black!Shocked by the seemingly unpleasant premonition, Logan stumbled.\u2018I should have found out how Lillian came back!\u2019He only cared about Psychke\u2019s runaway and failed to do so. How the hell he was supposed to fix this?Yzhar, who was the only one of his children, was also in trouble, and he has not been able to contact Shiona for a while.So, there was only one person who could rectify this situation.\u2018I have to visit Her Majesty.\u2019He knew that the emperor was about to abandon him after Psychke used her superpowers in front of Lestir.But the opportunity remained.Even though Psychke has manifested her special ability, she will not be able to use it until \u2018authoritized\u2019 yet.\u201cPrepare the wagon. I\u2019m going to the imperial palace.\u201dHe had acquired wealth and power so they must not be taken away from him.Even more so for a girl who is not yet dead!He gnashed his teeth, saying that he would bury Psychke by any means, be it an oracle or otherwise.It was then.\u201cDu, Duke!\u201dAn employee hurriedly came carrying a thin book.Logan\u2019s face hardened coldly as he accepted the book.What he received was not a book.It was a ledger with astronomical amounts written on it, making like a book by binding several sheets of paper together.While examining the ledger with curious eyes, he grabbed the back of his neck.\u201cLenox!\u201dThis son of a b*tch raised his blood pressure and he was about to lose his mind.He was about to go crazy at any point now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was currently in her small state as she was not using the artifact.Verndia was sitting leisurely on the sofa then nodded his head with a very serious expression on his face.\u201cPrincess, you can\u2019t dance.\u201dPsychke felt agitated when he said that. When did he see that?\u201cYes, I don\u2019t dance good.\u201d\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t dance well.\u201d\u201cDoes the Duke dance well?\u201d\u201cI think I dance better than you.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know anything as she never saw him danced at all.She seldom attended social gatherings, and she never crossed paths with Verndia.When she got engaged with him, they had a simple party but was not in the mood to dance.Well, it didn\u2019t matter what he said. Now was not the time for leisurely dancing or practicing.She flatly refused.\u201cI know how to dance in moderation. I don\u2019t even need lessons.Using Isolet, Verndia was the one who spread the rumor that \u2018 Glorielle will appear at the Second Prince\u2019s coming of age banquet\u2019.Therefore, that banquet is where the direct descendant of Silkisia will report her existence and the turning point for the future.For this, Psychke prepared a lot, and was still preparing.When she didn\u2019t fall for his provocation, Verndia pouted at her.\u201cIt\u2019s still not enough. It\u2019s your first time standing in front of the people as the \u2018Glorielle Silkisia\u2019, hence everything has to be perfect, right?\u201dThat was what Psychke agreed to.However,\u201cI don\u2019t have to be perfect in dancing since you will lead the dance, in moderation, please.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to lead without even guessing your level of dancing?\u201d\u201cI think you can do it just like how you danced with other young ladies, I will match your steps.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve ever danced with another woman?\u201dFinally, Psychke turned her head to look at him.She was clearly offended by the word \u2018other young lady\u2019.\u2018Well, the duke isn\u2019t the kind of person who would ask someone to be his partner.\u2019She then wondered if she could kick out the young lady whom he asked to be his partner, if he did.\u201cIt\u2019s usually polite to try to get the partners to agree before attending such an important banquet.\u201d\u201cWere there any manners like that at banquets other than the debutante? I am hearing it for the first time.\u201d\u201cIt just happened.\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m not a kid, why are you doing this? Psychke intently stared at him.She notices everything quickly but this one just isn\u2019t.In his frustration, Verndia finally raised hi forehead and grumbled.\u201cI just wanted to take a break. To cool off, practice dancing with me.\u201dAh. That\u2019s what it meant.She looked at the thing she was holding once and at Verndia afterward.She then put down what she was looking at.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dA paragraph just came to an end.Struggling, she moved her feet and headed towards the doll\u2019s bed on one side of her desk.\u201cI\u2019ll get some sleep. The Duke, please go in and rest.\u201d\u201cDo you want to practice dancing?\u201d\u201cNo. Rest.\u201dHe pretended to be fine, but she knew that his physical condition was not normal.The aftereffects of using the blue flame remain.Not too long ago, when he faced swords in sparring, the strength he felt was different from before. Should I say that there is a crack in the wall that was not even scratched?\u2018He seemed to have strained his body because he used more than his limitations. It would be best not to use superpowers for the time being.\u2019After an unsatisfying sparring, she happened to overheard a conversation between the attending physician and Verndia.\u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019\u2018It\u2019s nothing.\u2019\u2018Do not lie.\u2019Verndia, who did not want to answer, persisted in asking, and at last, she raised the white flag.\u2018I lost it for a second when I saw the princess get beaten up\u2026.. Well, that\u2019s what happened, though it\u2019s funny that I missed that woman, Shiona.\u2019Silkisia and Lestir\u2019s abilities influence each other. Be it suppressing or reinforcing other one.He replied as if nothing was wrong, but Psychke felt sorry for that.Even if she hadn\u2019t been beaten by Shiona, he wouldn\u2019t have used a stronger blue flame than usual.She didn\u2019t want to put a physical strain on Verndia for anything.So, her swordsmanship training was in the process of being alone these days.The man who read her mind crossed his arms and grunted lightly.\u201cIt means you don\u2019t even want to dance with me.\u201d\u201cI meant to take a break because I didn\u2019t have to practice.\u201d\u201cThe princess won\u2019t rest, won\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cI will rest.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cJust lie still and-\u201d\u201cYou thought?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re bad. You know that I still think of you when you lie down.\u201d\u201cDo not.\u201d\u201cThink when you work, think when you eat, think when you walk.\u201d(TN: Naauurr, Verndia is too expressive when after confessing, my heeeaarttt)Psychke deftly avoided the man\u2019s gaze as she picked his fingers one by one.An indescribable feeling of embarrassment crept in.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, so get out.\u201d\u201cDance lesson with me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t go either.\u201dHe know that she will not really go to sleep.She\u2019ll close her eyes, pretend to sleep, and go over the paperwork in her head.That wasn\u2019t all. Verndia clung to her tenaciously.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to practice dance.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be the first-time partners don\u2019t even work together.\u201d\u201cGet out. I will be fine.\u201d\u201cI should sleep here too.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke, who turned her back to him and lay down, was startled.Where would he sleep?As if to corroborate what she said, he sat upright on her sofa. He placed her tightly clasped hands on his stomach and closed his eyes.To her perplexity, Psychke remained still with her mouth slightly open.Then she came to her senses and gave out a small voice.\u201cDuke?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even budge. Even the irregular breathing sound has changed.However, Psychke was also a high-ranking player.\u201cDon\u2019t hold me here. I will sleep really well.\u201d\u201cDo you know what it means to sleep with a man and a woman in the same room?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Get out.\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThen I will leave.\u201dShe was going to go out and grab the papers she was looking at.However.\u201cDo you hate dancing with me so much?\u201dHe had approached her before she knew it, pressed her fingers firmly to prevent her from lifting the papers.\u201cDo you hate dancing, or do you hate me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re feel unwell.\u201d\u201cI know my body best. There is no need for the princess to care.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t spar with me, you don\u2019t want to dance with me, you don\u2019t care about me, you\u2019re the same as you were when we were kids, how can I make you see me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 All right. I will.\u201dIt came out like that, and she couldn\u2019t deny it.It should be a short practice, Psychke thought as she changed her body size with the brooch he gave her.But that wasn\u2019t it.* * *\u201cI heard you dance well?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this enough to dance well?\u201dAre you serious?With that meaning in mind, she looked at Verndia. He shamelessly smiled without averting his eyes.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t step on my feet, you can dance well.\u201d\u201cIt is natural.\u201d\u201cYour eyes are too high, princess.\u201dSoft waltz music rang through the empty space.Holding hands, the two rotated their bodies half a turn. The wide-open blue skirt hem also drew a round curve.Psychke, who accepted his jerking gestures without restraint, cut it off.\u201cI really can\u2019t dance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that.\u201d\u201cGet into the rhythm. This is not swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cEven though I did my best.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt seemed that he was dancing with a machine, not a person.Her movements were correct, but her stiffness was on another level.\u201cYou\u2019ve never danced in front of people except for practice, have you?\u201d\u201cDo you think I would have danced?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIt was obvious that he didn\u2019t dance because he didn\u2019t have a partner, or because she was annoyed.So it was like this.\u2018That\u2019s why he said to practice with him.\u2019Several times he asked her to follow the rhythm and move smoothly, but she was really stiff.As she turned three times in a row, he let out a sigh.The words that had been lingering in his head also came out of his mouth.\u201cBody.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon, princess.\u201d\u201cBecause you are a sword master, I thought you would be good at anything you do with your body.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t dance\u2026 No, isn\u2019t this good enough?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHow do you make that conclusion? Have you tried dancing with someone else?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn an instant, the strength in his hand went up. His expression hardened, and he let out a very low voice.\u201cWith whom?\u201d\u201cIt is bro\u2026 ther. this. I danced in the debutante.\u201dInadvertently calling Yzhar \u2018Brother\u2019, she was startled. Oh my, brother, brother.\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t another bastard.\u201dHe hated that he wasn\u2019t the first to dance with her but it was Yzhar but it couldn\u2019t be helped.The strength in Verndia\u2019s hands was relaxed. The same was true of the stiff facial muscles.\u201cStill, you did the debut tantrum.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about Silkisia\u2019s reputation, and she didn\u2019t want to say that I was an adopted daughter or he\u2019d be labeled.\u201dShe danced several times without stopping, and then she kept turning around and getting dizzy.Psychke suggested them to rest.Verndia escorted her to the couch. He sat down beside her and gently brushed her hair from her flushed cheeks.\u201cDoes the princess still think of Yzhar as her brother?\u201dIt was a voice that contained questions or concerns thrown in passing by.He wondered if there\u2019s anything left of their twenty years together.Psychke buried herself in the couch and smiled hollowly.\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s stuck in my mind.\u201d\u201cYzhar Silkisia is a worshiper. I don\u2019t know if Logan is in the cult too, but he\u2019s associated with forbidden magic.\u201d\u201cYes, they are.\u201dVerndia parted her lips.But instead of speaking outright as usual, he looked at her eyes and raised his voice.\u201cTell me in advance. I\u2019m sorry for the princess, but I won\u2019t keep alive the people involved in that cult.\u201dPsychke stared at him.There was no expression on her face, but Verndia quickly apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. Could it be that the sudden death of the predecessor Lestir 20 years ago had something to do with forbidden magic?\u201dPsychke asked cautiously.It was natural for ordinary people to hate their worshipers, but it wouldn\u2019t just be an ordinary hatred to say that he wouldn\u2019t let them live.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s his enemy.\u201cUm, yes.\u201dVerndia laughed bitterly.\u201cShould I tell you about it?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dShe was curious, but she decided to stop because he seemed to be burying the dark past.She could just ask, said Verndia, leaning slightly against her.\u201cNo. Now let\u2019s talk about what you needed to.\u201dWhile doing so, before going to the banquet hall, he began to explain carefully, saying that he would tell the princess what she must know.(TN: The leaning of his head to her shoulder, or the sort, the pouts, the cute complaints, how I love them.

It feels quite unfamiliar so I\u2019ll call them ancestors. Our ancestors died trying to find the connection between desertification and forbidden magic.\u201d\u201cThen isn\u2019t the Duke in danger too?\u201dA look of sorrow fell on Psychke\u2019s face.\u201cDuke is also chasing forbidden magic, right?\u201dVerndia laughed.\u201cMy stamina is good enough that I don\u2019t die from anything. If something suspicious happens, I will kill it right away.\u201dThanks to that, he was nicknamed crazy dog for killing anyone, but Verndia said jokingly.She did hear a terrifying rumor that if one did something wrong, he will be killed without spare.There are only rumors, but no one has actually seen the murder scene, and recently, even such rumors have not been circulating, leaving only the nickname \u2018Crazy Dog\u2019.\u2018There must have been a story like that.\u2019\u201cAbout ten years ago, they did not touch that case, but occasionally yes, yet they stopped out of the blue.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, I thought they gave up, but who would have known that they were making a reagent that separates my ability to kill me.\u201d\u201cIs it a separatist reagent?\u201d\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201dVerndia told her what he heard from Aiden. He left out words that Aiden was indeed a worshipper too, which surprised Psychke, again.\u201cThat.\u201dThen, thanks to the bizarrely calm Verndia, her mind suddenly jumped.It was such a big deal yet why was the Duke so relaxed?\u201cAre you okay, Duke?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHer face turned pale when she realized she didn\u2019t know what to ask.That is not an all-right situation. He had to adapt to the world that he didn\u2019t have any knowledge of, only so that he could live.How long did it take for him to become so numb to death threats?\u201cRelease your expression. I understand why, but I\u2019m also grateful for your concern, but you don\u2019t have to make that kind of expression. If anyone sees you, they\u2019d think that you were beaten up.\u201dHe mischievously tugged at her sad cheek.\u201cYou can just hit before it hits you.\u201d\u201cI will help too.\u201dAlthough he had a mission to retrieve Silkisia, it was also related to forbidden magic, so she could be of some help in pursuing those worshippers.The purple eyes that were looking at Psychke narrowed.Ah, how can you choose such pretty words?\u201cPrincess, you don\u2019t have to help, you just need to focus on your own. By the way, didn\u2019t you say you had a favor to ask of me?\u201dThe day before she went to the association, she had a favor to ask of her, which she evidently did.She had been so distracted that she forgot about it, but now she remembered it.\u201cOh, um.\u201dPsychke fell silent.She was going to ask him about it but the memory of forbidden magic prevented her from doing so.And she wasn\u2019t in a situation to say much even now. For that reason, the future was very uncertain.\u201cLater.\u201d\u201cLater, again?\u201d\u201cYes, I will tell you later.\u201d\u201cAre you going to run away?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAre you going to ask me to let you go after our breakup?\u201d\u201cNot even that. It\u2019s not that kind of favor, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dShe slipped from his back and stood up from the sofa, yet as if he didn\u2019t want to let go of her, he half-hugged her, smiling sweetly.The engagement rings were on each other\u2019s fingers.(TN: Literally took a long time to process, and just blush, Ugh, Verndia \u2018Inlove\u2019 Lestir is on different level.)\u201cI\u2019ll inform you in advance, but you\u2019re not allowed to go out of Lestir anymore.

Would you like to try it, firsthand?\u201dHer hair stood up on its end, as if they were electrocuted- his words still ringing in her ears. Her heart was beating uncontrollably and couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.Psychke removed his clasped hands and jumped up.\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough rest, so I\u2019m going to practice.\u201dVerndia, who smiled, stood up as well.Her excitement was conveyed through the ring, but the way she tried to pretend that nothing was wrong was so cute that he wanted to tease her more.\u201cYou can\u2019t dance because your heart is beating fast.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTake care of your heart, princess. Your feelings are conveyed through this, hmm?\u201d\u201cJust go practice dance with me.\u201dThroughout their practice, Verndia teased her happily.Psychke glared at his toes with her bare-blushing face.* *After a while, the day of the banquet for the second prince\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony finally dawned.\u201cIsolet.\u201dThe man who had been waiting for his fianc\u00e9e while sitting on the sofa in the hall of the Lestir Mansion began to speak.Unlike in the past days, Verndia today was dressed to the fullest.Not to mention his neatly combed hair which elaborated his appearance more.Combined with the dark blue uniform he wore to match his fianc\u00e9e; he was now something everyone will look back on at least once.Isolet wondered if even the employees who were familiar with him looked back once in a while passing by.He was so well-dressed that for some reason he had a distraught expression all morning.\u201cYes.\u201dIsolet, who was standing quietly beside him, replied.He wasn\u2019t quite dressed as good as Verndia, but he was suitably dressed.\u201cAbout the Princess.\u201d\u201cI have already found about 100 dating courses.\u201d\u201cDo you see me as someone who only dates?\u201d\u201cI had already spread the rumors that Miss Glorielle Silkisia will appear today.\u201dHe didn\u2019t mean to say that, but when the words came out, he became curious and accepted the aide\u2019s words.\u201cHow will the nobles react?\u201d\u201cAs expected, half of them dismiss it as nonsense, but the other half seems dubious.\u201d\u201cIs Silkisia coming today?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard that all members will come.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dVerndia leaned back on the sofa. He leaned over and rested his chin on the handle, resting his elbow on the same spot.When that posture merged with his expression, Isolet was bewildered because he looked like someone who was troubled by something.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d\u201cWorried?\u201dHis master was worried, who doesn\u2019t look like he will bleed even if he pricks with a needle.He doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it probably was not normalk. Isolet\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cAbout the Princess.\u201d\u201cIs there something wrong with the princess?\u201d\u201cThere is a big problem.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dOn a day like today?On days when everything was perfect?Isolet felt his eyes darken as he waited for his words to follow.However, it was very spectacle that she came out after a while.\u201cWe\u2019re not short of people.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s cute, she\u2019s good with a sword, she\u2019s got good hair, and now she\u2019s going to have a good family name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think the wrong guys will cling to her. I can\u2019t kill them all, so what should I do?\u201dVerndia was fed up with work, anything, but relationship was never he had any experience with, which irritated Isolet.Suddenly, Isolet\u2019s voice became sharper.\u201cSince when did you stare caring for everyone?\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to kill everyone?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the princess will do a good job blocking them all. She\u2019s engaged with you, so what are you so concerned about? There are rumors of feud between you two, though.\u201d\u201cRight. I don\u2019t know why that d*mn feud theory\u2026\u2026 won\u2019t go away.\u201dThe corners of Verndia\u2019s mouth twitched.Unless the rumors of their feud subsided, there would be impure men who would seize the opportunity to do something to her.\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t have to worry. The duke\u2019s personality has to be a bit awesome- no.\u201dHis ferocious eyes flew by.Isolet hurriedly changed his words by saying that if he was a person who wanted to die gracefully, he would not dare touch the princess.\u201cYou just have to show them that they will not dare.\u201d\u201cWhat more can I do there then?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about a little skin ship?\u201dSuddenly, a third person\u2019s voice interrupted him.The two men\u2019s attention were gained by that voice.On the central stairway leading to the hall, there was Cecil smiling meaningfully and Psychke carefully descending while waiting on her.In an instant, Verndia\u2019s eyes fluctuated greatly.The only accessories that Psychke wore were the circlet, magic crystal earrings, and brooch that she bought together in the past.With each step she took, each step she came down the stairs, his eyes dazzled as if he were seeing the light from a chandelier.So, he was even more annoyed. Who else would she show that to, besides him?Cecil, who had led Psychke to the irritating Verndia, asked a mischievous question.\u201cWhat do you think, Duke?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean skin ship. Like kissing the princess on the forehead instead of the back of her hand after the first dance? Then no one will talk about the feud?\u201dA strange light flashed in Verndia\u2019s eyes.Psychke, not seeing it, shook her head in an instant.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that far.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good, though?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try it now.\u201dHe swiftly rose from his seat, leaning over her.She was stunned by his face, which in an instant came close to her. So embarrassed, Psychke pushed him as hard as she could.\u201cNo, I do not want to!\u201dDump.Shocked by her no-no, his body collapsed onto the sofa. Her purple eyes shook as if an earthquake had struck.* * *\u201cDid you hear that? That Glorielle is coming here today.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know how she\u2019s still alive, and if she was, there\u2019s no proof that she\u2019s the Glorielle.\u201d\u201cThere was a word called a competent person.\u201d\u201cEy, she is the daughter of Leas, the competent person. What kind of stranger would you come if not the real one?\u201d\u201cIf she was truly capable, wouldn\u2019t His Majesty the Emperor pardon her?\u201d\u201cFor that reason, an oracle\u2026. Some say that Princess Lillian has powers.\u201d\u201cIf Princess Lillian had the ability, the words would have come out a long time ago. I heard, she also received a discernment ceremony.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t it come out no?\u201d\u201cPrince Lennox said that the color of the holy water has changed\u2026 Shh, they\u2019re near.\u201dSeeing Lillian getting closer, the nobles shut their mouths at the same time.Lillian couldn\u2019t hear them well because of their distance, but from the look on their faces, she could tell from one glance what their topic was.Lillian bit the tender flesh in her mouth.To manage her image, she had to act like she didn\u2019t know anything and pretended to be naive, but it didn\u2019t work out because she was feeling aggravated as of the moment.One of the young ladies, who was chatting with others, smiled and approached Lillian.\u201cOh, Princess Lillian! You are so beautiful today!\u201d\u201cThank you for your kind words. What were you talking about with them?\u201d\u201cAh, they were talking about the rumors floating around recently\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you saying that the princess is a powerful person?\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201d\u201cI heard that this is the first time that all those with abilities exist since the invitation! You are really amazing, Princess!\u201dWhile Hilvia praised Lillian, she waved her pink fan and held Lillian\u2019s hand.Adding that Hilvia was looking at Lillian with such eyes saying it was such an honor to knows a great person like her.The corners of Lillian\u2019s mouth, which she barely lifted up, quivered.Hilvia, not seeing that, continued her words.\u201cDuke Lestir didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d\u201cThe Duke? Why would he\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, why?\u201dHilvia winked, asking why would she be asking something obvious?She looked around, and after she made sure that Lestir was gone, she lowered her voice.\u201cI wondered if it was time for the princess to give her heart. You should know by now that you are talented.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t say anything though.\u201d\u201cHuh, it looks like the fake has been baked and boiled for quite some time. I hear she was staying in Lestir mansion, right?\u201dLillian and Hilvia, the young ladies surrounding the two, responded.\u201cI heard that too. They say the duke cares for Princess Psychke very much.\u201d\u201cThey said it was all lies.\u201d\u201cTo lie, you know the duke\u2019s personality. I\u2019m not the kind of person who would let anyone into Lestir.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know the truth.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it for today.\u201dHilvia stretched her fan across her chest and said triumphantly.\u201cYou can look forward to it. I prepared something really awesome today!\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, is Princess Psychke coming today?\u201d\u201cWill she come with Duke Lestir? And how much of a fox she will do. I think the Duke doesn\u2019t really have eyes to see either.\u201dThanks to Hilvia, the topic of conversation shifted from the rumors that Lillian had the ability to belittling Psychke for seducing Verndia.Lillian let out a sigh of relief.But that peace did not last long.\u201cDuke Verndia Lestir and Psy\u2026 Oh, oh? No, that\u2019s really\u2026. what? But that\u2026.\u201dIt was noisy outside. The voice of the attendant announcing the status was disturbed.But the commotion soon subsided.\u201cDuke of Verndia Lestir and Glorielle Silkisia have arrived!\u201d\u2026 Who came?The banquet hall became quiet as if cold water had been poured on it.All the nobles\u2019 eyes were focused on one place.Never before had the light from the crevice of the door widening without sound seemed so terrifying.Lillian clenched her fists until her fingernails dug into her palms.\u2018Why is a woman named Glorielle coming in with Duke Lestir? No way\u2026\u2019But to her regret, the woman who walked out of her light was someone she knew all too well.Luscious silver hair that curls down to her waist.Blue eyes that seemed to capture the clear autumn sky.If there was something different from her, it would be the impression of being ruthless.Hilvia, who had been lost in herself, murmured.\u201c\u2026 Princess Psychke?\u201dThe young lady next to her asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t \u00a0the attendant just said Glorielle Silkisia?\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026.\u201d\u201cPrincess Psychke\u2026\u201d\u201cGlorielle Silkisia?\u201dAgain, Psychke moved her steps.Just as a drop of rain on a calm lake creates huge ripples, the sound of her shoes creates huge ripples in the quiet banquet hall.A silent shudder was contagious.None of them moved until Verndia, who smiled, opened his mouth.\u201cWhat are you doing to people, it\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve seen you, stop looking, we\u2019re getting old.\u201dHe leisurely escorted his fianc\u00e9e.A step, and another one. No one breathed nor did someone take their eyes off of them.Only Psychke\u2019s shoes made a sound in the silence that could be heard even if a needle fell.Every time the two moved their feet, the crowd split like the parting of the sea.Then, at some point, a murmur like a sigh broke the silence.\u201cNonsense\u2026.\u201dThat became the starting point, and the path the two had passed began to be filled with someone\u2019s gossip.\u201cIs it true, Princess Psychke was the daughter of Leas?\u201d\u201cLooking at it now, I think she resembles Leas. Why did we not know until now?\u201d\u201cBut why was she coming in with Duke Lestir?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the guards? No matter what, Glorielle is also a sinner!\u201d\u201cWill Duke Lestir just watch? At times like this, it\u2019s best to just stay still.\u201d\u201cDo you know the Duke of Silkisia?\u201dPsychke listened carefully to all these words.The eyes following her were intense, but unlike usual, she didn\u2019t feel bad. Her exalted body shuddered finely.\u201cAre you having that much fun?\u201dThe emotions conveyed through the ring are dizzyingly deep.Believing that she could feel such intense emotions, Verndia smiled.\u201cYes.\u201dThe corner of her mouth went up involuntarily. It wasn\u2019t pure joy.Psychke tightened the hand that held his arm.His arms were wrapped in his clothes, so she couldn\u2019t feel his body heat, but she could clearly sense that he was by her side.She saw an antique tapestry hanging on one side of the banquet hall.Patterns that would normally not have paid attention to were clearly embedded in both eyes.A scene where unicorns and baby angels play to heal the ruined battlefield.It was a symbol of victory.Stopping her steps, she turned and looked at the banquet hall.The nobles were still looking only at her.Each person\u2019s expression was different, but the bass was so fresh that it was surprising.\u2018What a surprise.\u2019Aren\u2019t the emotions expressed at a banquet too raw for nobles who tremble in everything?\u201cE, ehem.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019re starting a new business soon, Count?\u201dThose who met her eyes hurriedly turned their heads.Pretending not to see her, pretending not to be interested, talking to people around them, and changing the topic.But the tilt of their body, the direction of their feet, and other things she had no control over showed that they were rather interested.It was as expected so far.And the man approaching her at a fast pace was as expected.His face was distorted so that he could be seen from a distance.It was showing off the charred inside without adding or subtracting.Yzhar, Lennox, and Lillian could be seen behind him.They didn\u2019t follow their father and were frozen in place as if nailed to it.Psychke waited until Logan got closer, then grabbed the hem of her skirt and slightly bent her knees.\u201cGreetings to the Duke of Silkisia.\u201dLogan\u2019s mouth fell open at the words that felt an obvious sense of distance.He let out a hard breath like a father shocked by his daughter\u2019s defiance, then moved his chapped, chapped lips.\u201cWhat are you doing, Duke Lestir?\u201dHis blue gaze filled with years reached Verndia and Verndia laughed.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou took my daughter and what have you done?\u201dAha.Verndia immediately understood what Logan was trying to say.But pretending not to know, he crossed his arms and tilted his head to the left.\u201cAs you can see, I am treating you with sincerity.\u201d\u201cGlorielle. No matter how much you wanted to attack Silkisia, was there even a need to name a dead person on my daughter?\u201dThe nobles murmured at Logan\u2019s words.As the guards planted by Logan opened their mouths at the right time, the \u2018appearance of Glorielle\u2019 began to be downgraded to a trap set up by Verndia to attack Silkisia.Verndia narrowed his eyes.\u201cShe\u2019s dead? Do you really think so?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d\u201cI heard that, but what do you think, Princess?\u201d\u201cI am dead\u2026\u201dA steady voice echoed through the banquet hall.It was a quiet, peaceful voice, but it had a strange power over people, and even those noisy were momentarily speechless as they stared at her.Psychke placed one of her hands on her chest. Slowly, she announced her existence without high or low.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. I am alive like this.\u201d\u201cPsychke!\u201dAn enraged Logan roared at her.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to you in Lestir, but you are being deceived! Saying you are Glorielle\u2026 say something with sense\u2014\u201d\u201cI can show me proof that I am Glorielle.\u201dThe high-pitched shouts suddenly stopped.Understanding her meaning, Logan gritted his teeth.He heard that she has a supernatural power, and she could already use it at her own will!The eyes of the nobles who were watching the two were curious.They had foreseen the great storm that would blow upon Silkisia.It was then.\u201cHis Majesty has arrived!\u201dThe attendant who announced their status, also announced the presence of the Emperor.It was the beginning of a full-scale banquet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was only because she was forced to do so by Verndia\u2019s threats, and since Leas and her family were disowned, her daughter, Glorielle, had no family name.So, the attendant, who shouted her name, blurted out his words vaguely.\u201cGlorielle?\u201dEven when the two preceding families, Evergreen and Silkisia, gave presents, the empathetic emperor stopped talking.\u201cDid you say Glorielle?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe attendant bowed deeply and answered.He expected that due to the emperor\u2019s personality, he might see blood in this spot.As if he had seen something interesting, he changed his sitting position, bending and looking down.On the red carpet, Psychke and Verndia bowed at the place where they gave gifts to the Second prince.At the same time, they congratulated the second prince who was sitting in front of the emperor.\u201cCongratulations on his coming of age.\u201d\u201cHappy Birthday.\u201dInstead of being greeted, the second prince looked behind him.Not befitting his age, he looked at his father with a look of unsure of what to do with her pure appearance.The emperor looked at the two people arrogantly.\u201cRaise your head.\u201dThe moment he heard his voice, Psychke realized.\u2018He must be the emperor.\u2019In the past, the man who ordered Shiona to be brainwashed and to call her master was the emperor.The Duke of Verndia said that it seems that he was the one who framed her parents.\u2018Just why\u2026\u2019She forcibly prevented something that was arising from within her.She couldn\u2019t make eye contact with the emperor, so she expressionlessly stared at his feet sitting on a high platform.The corner of the emperor\u2019s mouth drew an arc as he looked at her like that. His eyes weren\u2019t smiling, though.\u201cHow can you make me believe that you are Glorielle?\u201dPsychke pretended to be as normal as possible and answered.\u201cI can use Silkisia\u2019s unique abilities.\u201dThe surprised nobles gasped by the words that came out.The emperor leisurely crossed his legs.\u201cShow me.\u201dPsychke obeyed him.Slowly, the ambient temperature lowered and from where her feet was, a blue aura spread, and a faint frost covered it.The giant snow crystal pattern was carved into the bottom, centered around her.Twinklingly, the blue light grains that emerged from the patterns were scattered in the air.The blue aura that swayed across the floor spread all over the place.Like a gift sprinkled by a fairy, it became transparent ice crystals and floated in the air.It hovered in one place, creating ice storms, and creating fields of flowers that swayed delicately in the breeze.The way they looked changed just like that.A sharp ice crystal brushed the emperor\u2019s cheek.It was so small and so fleeting that no one saw it.The emperor stroked his cheek with the back of his hand but no blood oozed out.Psychke pretended not to see his meaningful gaze and continued to use her superpowers.Then she finished it after placing iced wine glasses in the hands of everyone at the party.Surprised by the scope and detail of the superpower, the nobles murmured.\u201cOh my god. She can handle something like this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything of this scale in the history books.\u201dPsychke straightened her back.In eyes of many people, she was weak. But now, her training with Verndia was worthwhile.\u201cHmm.\u201dA satisfied smile appeared on the corner of the emperor\u2019s mouth as he patted his icy cheek.He rolled an ice glass as if it contained real alcohol, then slowly stood up.\u201cYou\u2019re the untouchable Silkisia.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSilent consternation spread among the nobles.The emperor named Leas\u2019s daughter, Glorielle Silkisia!Logan, who had been watching all this devastated, bit his lip.There was a look of utter despair on his face.\u201cBut you know what?\u201dSlowly descending the steps of the podium, the emperor looked elegant.\u201cYour mother, Leas, has committed a great sin against the imperial family.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cAnd that sin was a sin that applies to her children as well.\u201dHe stood tall in front of her so she lowered her gaze.\u201cGlorielle.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you would come all this way as a sinner, and without fear.\u201dThe emperor stretched out a hand and its destination was Psychke\u2019s neck.However, before the hand reached halfway, Verndia blocked it.\u201cI was the one who brought the princess, so it seems right to punish me.\u201d\u201cDo you intend to be punished?\u201d\u201cIf one commits a crime, he must be punished. That is, \u2018If he had sinned.\u2019\u201dVerndia looked straight at the emperor.Deeply sunken purple eyes were burning more fiercely than usual.The emperor looked at him with an unknown face. Then he slowly opened his mouth.\u201cDuke.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou better be careful.\u201dIt was an eerie warning not to climb any further.However, Verndia did not blink an eye. Rather,\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201dHe blurted out words that was not even from the bottom of his heart.The emperor\u2019s gray eyes glared at him.When he was looking at Psychke, there was even a faint warmth, but now it was cold.\u201cThe crime of bringing a sinner into this was serious but it\u2019s not appropriate right now. Hence, I\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201dAfter speaking, the emperor returned to his throne.The nobles were shaken again by his actions.Although the emperor called Glorielle a criminal, he did not even issue a summary judgment.Even though Lestir blocked him, judging from the atmosphere, the emperor wouldn\u2019t have killed him if he had done more than that.What does this mean?\u2018Is the owner of Silkisia changing?\u2019\u2018He didn\u2019t even tell the oracle!\u2019\u2018Maybe he decided that it would be better to keep him alive because he is a person with outstanding abilities?\u2019\u2018Well, according to the oracle, that would be more dangerous. Then, what about the Duke of Silkisia?\u2019Silent words came and went through eyes and gestures.In the meantime, Psychke and Verndia bowed before the Second Prince.And it went back to its original celebration, neither fast nor slow.* *After the order of presenting gifts to the main character of the banquet was over.The musicians who were waiting started playing a calm song. It was time to dance.It started with the 2nd prince.Usually at such a party, the first dance partner was chosen by the person herself, but the timid second prince handed the authority to his father.The emperor nominated Lilian without much hesitation.In the middle of the hall, watching the two of them dancing, Psychke thought about this and that.\u2018Am I weighing it?\u2019There must have been a reason why the emperor had named Lillian as the Second prince\u2019s dance partner.For example, to show the nobles that Logan was still alive and well as the Duke of Silkisia.\u2018It was strange enough to have Lillian as his dance partner in the first place.\u2019So, there was a high possibility that all of this was the Emperor\u2019s planned performance.Was he trying to shake the current Silkisia and her at the same time?\u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019It was not like she didn\u2019t have it in her mind.She was confident that she wouldn\u2019t be shaken no matter what, so she didn\u2019t worry.\u201cI don\u2019t dance dirty. Even if I dance alone, I will dance better than that.\u201dVerndia, who was next to her, whispered mischievously.Psychke laughed thinking- \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019He requested a dance after the performance of the Second prince and Lillian was over.\u201cShall we dance to a song?\u201d\u201cGladly.\u201dShe put mine on the outstretched firm hand of his and he led her to the center.Eyes who stared at her had increased.Even when Lillian and the 2nd Prince were dancing, half of them were spying on me, but now\u2026.\u2018I think it\u2019s about 9% out of 10.\u2019Verndia, who was standing across from her, tugged at her slightly and muttered in a joking tone.\u201cI wonder if the practice was worthwhile.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201dWhen she answered indifferently, he wrapped one hand around her waist.She surrendered to his lead and moved stiffly. As if her special training was worthwhile, Verndia was certainly gentle.Lightly, music wrapped around her ears.She danced to the beat.A blue dress under an ornate chandelier was dancing.She saw people with different facial expressions in their eyes.Hilvia turned blue, Lennox was in disbelief, and Yzhar seemed to deny the reality\u2026It was a pretty good feeling to see the changed eyes of those who always criticized her.\u201cConcentrate.\u201dVerndia whispered using the dance as an excuse to be closer to her.Psychke, who had been looking over his shoulder, looked away.\u201cLook at me.\u201dHe was smiling prettily as if he were satisfied with the situation.Ignoring the beat, his lips brushed through her hair.She was taken aback but only blushed and said nothing. She realized what he wanted to do.The noble with the highest power in the empire, excluding the imperial family.The one who receives affection from Verndia was her.This proposition must be clearly engraved in everyone\u2019s mind.\u2018Use me.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll use you as much as I want.\u2019As he said in the carriage before coming to the banquet hall.He whispered, enjoying the gaze of the buzzing nobles.\u201cI thought everyone would feel bad when they see you, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt felt like I had dug up a gemstone that no one knew about. I\u2019m dying to brag about it.\u201dSeriously, where do you pick words like that?Her face blushed and lowered her gaze.Verndia smiled and hugged her close to her music.\u201cYou know? That you can\u2019t stay here. Princess is someone who should shine many times more than now.\u201dPsychke looked into his eyes.His purple eyes, which contained only her, were burning with a certain passion, reminding her of his supernatural power, the unquenchable flame.The flame that lit up the darkness so that she, who had lost the light, could shine again.He was just like that.Emotions that cannot be defined by anything else welled up. Psychke gave strength to the hand that held her.His red lips curled into a smile as his body temperature rose.\u201cYou will climb up to the place so high everyone looks up to you.\u201dSlowly, the song slowed down.Thus, the dance was over.\u201cBecause I will make it that way.\u201dAlong with the beat, his voice changed softly.No, maybe it was only Psychke who felt that way.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201dA faint sound of breathing passed her ears.\u201cDo you understand?\u201dVerndia, who brushed his lips against her ear pretending to have made a mistake while finishing the dance, corrected his posture.He kissed the back of her hand with a seemingly natural expression.\u201cYou said you hate it in the forehead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHer face heated up again, along with her ears and he back of her hand.Psychke did not know what to say to alleviate the heat.(TN: You know what? Just kiss already! Ugh!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He blocked the emperor. At this rate the Lestir\u2019s Duchess\u2026.\u2019\u2018But, isn\u2019t she a sinner?\u2019\u2018You still don\u2019t know? If His Majesty had really intended to treat them as criminals, they would have been dragged out long ago!\u2019\u2018Then what will become of Silkisia? I\u2019m sure Glorielle won\u2019t just stare at the current Silkisia.\u2019Listening to their gaze with one ear, Psychke moved to a secluded place.The saying, \u2018A thirsty man digs a well\u2019, was right as people still watching them approaching one by one.They were mainly those who had a close relationship with Verndia.\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201dAfter receiving two glasses of champagne from a passing attendant, Berndia handed one over.Psychke took the glass and moistened her lips expressionlessly.Those who were acquainted with Verndia and her were those who regarded him and his betrothed as \u2018the stupid princess.I wasn\u2019t thrilled to have to deal with them, but I knew they didn\u2019t understand, so I waited in silence.But there was someone who came faster than anyone else.\u201cPrincess.\u201dIt was Widnix Evergreen. He was as impersonal as the last time I saw him.He felt it even when presenting gifts, but it was surprising that he, who was famous for his dislike of noisy places, was here.Psychke stared at him.Before the two could start talking, Verndia interrupted with a serious expression.\u201cWidnix, let\u2019s talk for a minute.\u201d\u201cI am not talking to you.\u201d\u201cI guess you want to say that I used my power for the princess.\u201dWidnix\u2019s eyes moved, blinking slowly, giving out a low-pitched voice.\u201cHow far have you heard?\u201d\u201cAll of those bulls***. You said the princess would kill me?\u201d\u201cIt is true. Don\u2019t you know best what the penalty of your power is like? It was just a warning not to use it again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s off topic. What does that have to do with you?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t promise that you will never use it again.\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression turned ferocious.He lowered his voice and had a long conversation with Widnix.Psychke stared at the back of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s head, then moved a little further away.She left the place for the two of them to talk.\u2018I think it\u2019s a story related to the Duke\u2019s power.\u2019I don\u2019t know what kind of authority it was that made the atmosphere so threatening.She wet her lips with the champagne she was holding. She was less fizzy than the first time, but it was okay.Just then, someone called her.\u201cPsychke.\u201dAt the unpleasant voice, Psychke removed the glass from her lips.It was Logan.She left the empty glass on the tray of a passing attendant, ignoring the hardened Logan, and picked up a new one.It was red wine.It was the same color she drank at a party to celebrate Lillian\u2019s return the other day. Although the scent was so much better than that one.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to call me by that name.\u201dIn a very heartless voice, she said the exact opposite of what she had asked Verndia to call her Psychke.Logan was the one who gave her the name Psychke, and the one who used it to trample on her self-esteem.Even if she didn\u2019t get what she deserved in Glorielle, he never wanted to be called Psychke.Two pairs of blue eyes collided in the air.He was cold as if he were looking at his enemies without making any concessions.Among them, Logan, who broke the silence, threatened.\u201cHow long do you think you can do this? You haven\u2019t forgotten about your situation, have you?\u201d\u201cWhat could they be?\u201d\u201cYour mother\u2019s sins.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything to worry about, Duke.\u201d\u201cI am very proud that His Majesty acknowledged it a little.\u201dIt bothered him to call him as \u2018Duke\u2019 without the slightest hesitation, and Logan sharply crumpled his face.\u201cOne, your mother\u2019s sins are not so easily erased. It\u2019s not too late. Just come back and I will accept you as her daughter.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201d\u201cThis is your last chance to become a real Silkisia. Haven\u2019t you always wanted it?\u201dSo funny. It was always this hilarious.Psychke raised the corner of her mouth and drank all the remaining wine. Her drunkenness did not rise.\u201cIs there anyone in the world who wants the obvious?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you think I really need to wish that I could be a Silkisia?\u201dRealizing what she meant, Logan\u2019s face twisted terribly.Psychke sighed bitterly.\u201cIt\u2019s natural, no need to wish for it.\u201d\u201cDo you think His Majesty would tolerate that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he would hate it.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want the recognition of the Emperor who had ruined her family, but she said that to scratch Logan\u2019s heart.\u201cHave you not seen it? Your Majesty has saved me.\u201dNot only that, after seeing her supernatural ability, he even said that she was a \u2018Silkisia without a fail\u2019.Logan, who was furious with Psychke\u2019s imposing attitude, gnashed his teeth.\u201cPsychke, you dare-\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. I am Glorielle.\u201dA snowball fight ensued again. Two pairs of similar yet different blue eyes embraced each other.Logan wheezed as if he wanted to step on them right away, but Psychke didn\u2019t care and looked straight at him.It was then that the imperial attendant bowed.\u201cMiss Glorielle, His Majesty the Emperor is calling for you.\u201dLogan\u2019s face stiffened at the words \u2018His Majesty the Emperor\u2019.She felt that his expression was really satisfying.\u201cAll right.\u201dPsychke turned her back and ignored Logan.* *The attendant led her to a secret terrace hidden behind a huge statue.As if to prove that it was not a space used by just anyone, the terrace was shaped like a room.Lazy music, expensive rugs on the floor, and luxurious white furniture.Right in the middle of her, the emperor greeted her expressionlessly.\u201cHere you are.\u201dHe was holding an ice cup that Psychke had made with supernatural powers.\u201cNo matter how much power I put into it, it still won\u2019t melt.\u201dShe grabbed the hem of her skirt, bowed her head and turned the empty glass like a real glass of wine.\u201cI greet the sun of the empire.\u201d\u201cDo you like to drink?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cMy bad.\u201dThe emperor, who replied that he was not sorry at all, moved to his seat and uncorked the red wine bottle. He filled it and held it out.Psychke did not move, didn\u2019t even raise her head.The emperor was sarcastic as if he didn\u2019t like it.\u201cThe cup the emperor is giving you, are you going to refuse it?\u201dOnly then did Psychke raise her eyes and glance at the red wine.Although the color and aroma seem to be much better than what was served in the banquet hall.It was disgusting to receive it, so she pretended to make a mistake and let go of his ability.Chwaa!The glass of ice melted. As it fell, mixed with the contents that had lost its support, red liquid flowed down the emperor\u2019s hand.For a moment, Psychke had the illusion that the liquid was blood.\u201cHaa.\u201dThe emperor, who had been staring blankly at his hand, sneered.Psychke, who didn\u2019t care about him, apologized for lying.\u201cMy apologies. It hasn\u2019t been long since I acquired my power, I am still amateur.\u201d\u201cWere you?\u201dIt was a disbelieving voice, but it didn\u2019t matter.Psychke lowered her head even more. Then he held her chin in his hand.\u201cGlorielle.\u201dThe strong scent of wine from the Emperor\u2019s hands stung her nose.She sighed, trying to calm down but she was frowning. Suddenly, the emperor thrust his face into her.Now, the distance between the two was only about half a span.As if he was wearing a mask, he had no expression and let out a dry voice.\u201cBetween the past and now, that boldness has not changed.\u201dPast? Are you talking about when she was young?\u201cAs for your relationship with Lestir, nothing has changed.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s gray eyes uttered incomprehensible words one after another, arrogant enough to eat her.Feeling that he was being strangled, Psychke strained her eyes.Then, strangely, the stiff expression of the man softened.He asked softly as if soothing a crying child.\u201cYour eyes, are you still scared?\u201dHow did he know that?Eye phobia was a secret only to Silkisia.When someone asked why it was taboo to invite Silkisia to the North, she would answer only to this extent, \u2018There are always things in the North that don\u2019t exist in the South.\u2019She didn\u2019t say what exactly it was.\u2018But how?\u2019\u201cYou must be scared, nothing has really changed.\u201dThe emperor let go of her chin and had a strangely satisfied look.\u201cShia.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cGlorielle.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThis is different.\u201dHe stretched out his wine-scented hand.Psychke reflexively backed away at the gesture of trying to brush her cheek.Why is he doing this?He was the one who shattered the previous generation of Silkisia and brainwashed her.He thought that since the plan had gone wrong, he would either appease or threaten, and she accepted the meeting because she wanted to hear something.The way he looked at her right now, and how the atmosphere fills this space.Doesn\u2019t it feel like reuniting with a long-lost lover?Suddenly, the voice she heard on the tombstone of the first Silkisia in the Ashen Forest came to mind.\u2018Beware of Adelheid.\u2019Adelheid was the name of the current emperor and the first emperor.Should she be careful with this man?The emperor looked down numbly at the hand that had lost his target, then smiled.\u201cAt times like this, you look like Shia again.\u201d\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201dShe asked directly, not wanting to stay here any longer.A man of about the same age as Verndia smiled slightly, unbefitting the years he had lived.He pursed his lips, almost inaudibly.\u201cDo you want me to give you Silkisia?\u201dFor a moment, Psychke doubted her ears. What was he doing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You will use your power on me.\u201dThe mind that had been confused by the word power returned.Psychke hastily distanced herself from him.From his place, he did not take his eyes off of her and did not pursue her anymore. He licked his lips with his bright red tongue.\u201cIf you really are the reincarnation of the original Silkisia, then your powers must be the same as hers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it that difficult to answer?\u201dWhen she didn\u2019t say anything, the emperor assumed she was worried and asked.\u201cHaving done it once, the second should be easy.\u201dWhat is the reincarnation of the first Silkisia, and what was it about having tried it once?She couldn\u2019t grasp what he was saying at all.However, no matter how incomprehensible the situation was, there were laws that do not change.For example, the criminal who framed the mother.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dPsychke flatly refused.She doesn\u2019t know what her power was, but judging from the way he said it, it must be something beneficial for him.The emperor tilted his head slightly, as if he did not know that she would reject it with a sharp cut.Then he made a sound like a snake crawling on silk.\u201cWhy?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t have to tell the other person what kind of card she was holding against him.In this unfavorable situation, there was no need to say, \u2018I know you framed me\u2019 or that \u2018I know you brainwashed me\u2019.So she kept her mouth shut, and the emperor clicked his tongue.\u201cWhy was this happening again?\u201dAs he moved his steps toward the balcony that led outside, he muttered words into his mouth that Psychke couldn\u2019t hear.\u201cWas it because of Lestir again\u2026\u201dPsychke stared at the emperor\u2019s back, then opened her eyes tightly.It was disgusting.She didn\u2019t know he could and would casually return Silkisia to her in a cruel and outrageous act.She didn\u2019t want to be here any longer.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty, but I\u2019m feeling unwell, so I\u2019m going to go.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dHe summoned Psychke and approached with heavy footsteps.At first glance, she seemed to see something red in his hand, but she didn\u2019t care.However,\u201cYou\u2019ve always liked this.\u201dHe handed over what he had brought as if forcibly taking it upon himself.\u2018What?\u2019Psychke looked down at her hand, feeling as if she was holding on to flowing water.And she was shocked.In her hand fluttered a butterfly with blood-red wings on her black body.She reflexively tried to release her powers but was stopped by the Emperor.His voice was as cold as skin of a snake and spewed.\u201cThink carefully. I will win this time.\u201dPsychke said nothing.* *She pretended to return to the banquet hall, but then she entered the empty terrace.She drew the curtains to let her know that someone was using them. She hopped over the railing and leaned against it.The night wind blew. It was the end of summer, but there was a slight damp breeze.Because of that, Psychke finally realized that she was breaking out in a sweat.\u201cEut-\u201dShe didn\u2019t feel well. Even though she filled herself with small meal, she wanted to eat more.She covered her mouth with her free hand.Her wind-blown hair hit her face, but she didn\u2019t care.She gasped and erased the conversation with the emperor then her nauseous stomach slowly subsided.Then, her gaze landed in one place.It was a red bow held in her hand.\u2018This.\u2019Psychke raised her gaze.She gazed at a flock of butterflies flying across the night sky against the background of a hazy full moon.A cluster of magically colored butterflies was within reach of her head above her head.It was released by the imperial family as part of the ceremony.\u2018I heard that if you catch it, it will grant your wish.\u2019She doesn\u2019t believe in superstitions like that and even if she does, she doesn\u2019t want to accept what it will give her.Psychke raised her hand holding the butterfly high and released it without hesitation.Flutter, flutter.The red butterfly, whose wings had been crumpled from the moment she received it, couldn\u2019t keep its balance.It struggled to flutter and blend into the crowd, but its unstable wings allowed it to stand out wherever it was.Psychke looked at it without hesitation.She then saw a butterfly that was slightly larger than the others and was unusually bright.\u2018He looks like the duke.\u2019Black body with purple wings.It was a butterfly resembling Verndia.She was never greedy for a butterfly that grants wishes but somehow she wanted to have that.Psychke braced herself against the balustrade, then rose and stretched out her hand in the air above her.She wasn\u2019t on the short side, but she was so tall that it made her fingertips almost touch it.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dShe took off her shoes and climbed onto the balustrade, about an inch high.Only then did it reach the tip of her finger, but it was not enough to grab it.\u2018A little bit. Just a little bit more\u2026\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re really a real bean rat.\u201dShe was startled by his voice that came out of nowhere and she turned around.Then she almost lost her balance and fell outside.The astonished Verndia rushed her.She smelled light grass from him, as she had ever been outside.\u201cSorry. Were you surprised?\u201d\u201cYou need to stop pretending to be popular.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the curtains close?\u201dShe didn\u2019t hear, probably because she was focused on catching that butterfly.Her face heated up. She was ashamed to think that the butterfly she was trying to catch turned into a human.(TN: Uhm, I hate my mind somehow\u2026)She glared at Verndia\u2019s chest.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d\u201cDoes the princess believe in this too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I just want to catch it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, even taking off her shoes, she\u2019s very eager, I see.\u201dThere was nothing more she could say against his teasing tone.So, when she was still, he tucked the tangled silver hair behind her ear and tidied it up.A strange feeling of heat bloomed from the place where his hand touched.Verndia said playfully.\u201cEven with a brooch, you\u2019re still short, what should I do?\u201d\u201cI am not short.\u201d\u201cYou did not catch the butterfly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dShe was trying to catch something that was difficult to catch on her own.If she had tried to catch another butterfly, she would have caught it.However, if he had ask, \u2018Why did you try to catch it\u2019, she would have nothing to say.\u201cThen it was. I am short.\u201dAnd tried to leave the terrace.\u201cAre you upset?\u201dBut she could barely go a step and was already caught.He blocked her way so that she couldn\u2019t exactly leave the railing.Then Psychke raised her eyes and looked at him.That black hair, which had been neatly arranged, stretched out like a magpie nest.\u2018Did he even fight Duke Widnix?\u2019Psychke inadvertently reached out and gently pressed his tousled hair down.What are you doing? The puzzled Verndia\u2019s face came to her mind.\u201cI tidied it up. Was it still messy?\u201d\u201cA little bit. Did your talk end well?\u201d\u201cWell, yes\u2026 How was the princess? I think the emperor called while I was gone.\u201d\u201cJust, likewise.\u201dPsychke blurted out her words. It wasn\u2019t a good story, so she didn\u2019t want to tell it.Understanding her dark expression, Verndia grabbed her shoulders and turned her body the other way.\u201cShall I catch a butterfly?\u201d\u201cOh, oh, I don\u2019t believe this\u2014!\u201dIn surprise, she held her feet up because he hugged her knees and lifted her up.\u201cYou must eat a lot.\u201dHe smiled at her, saying, \u201cHow can you lift the sword when you\u2019re this light?\u201d Then nodded towards the butterfly.I\u2019ll help you, so grab it.Psychke looked down at him with bewildered eyes, then reluctantly averted her eyes at successive urgings.The elusive purple butterfly was right in front of her nose.She felt somewhat embarrassed.\u2018Should I pretend I didn\u2019t see it and catch something else?\u2019But before she could come to her conclusion about that thought, a voice from beneath her urged her on.\u201cYou can catch that one.\u201d\u201cThat one?\u201d\u201cYeah, that. No, not that\u2026 \u2026 The one next that looks like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dShe should have pretended to catch it reluctantly when she tried to grab something else, but strangely, her face turned red.Hiding her emotions from others was as good as breathing, so why was she always like this in front of him?\u201cPrincess, your body is suddenly getting hot. Are you unwell?\u201dEven though he could feel her body was getting hot, he still had to say it. Like a bad person.Gripping this, Psychke stretched out her hand toward the purple butterfly.What was difficult with my own strength was so easy to grasp.\u201cYour pulse is very fast. Is it an arrhythmia?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe sighed and put her to the ground.Holding the purple butterfly carefully so as not to wrinkle her wings.\u201cYeah, he\u2019s handsome because he looks like me.\u201dThose were his first words when he saw the purple butterfly up close.A smile came out when he knew he was good-looking man.He stared at her who was staring at the butterfly.\u201cDo you agree?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWhen she said that in a grumpy voice, Verndia was genuinely surprised.\u201cButterflies? Or me?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cPrincess, your taste are high. I didn\u2019t think you wouldn\u2019t see it at this rate.\u201dHe hoped he was not inferior. He has good aura that takes over almost everyone.But instead of outwardly expressing such thoughts, Verndia pursed his lips and muttered seriously.\u201cStill, there is no one more handsome than me in the empire, so I should consider it fortunate.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pfft.\u201d\u201cWhat is that, that smile?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean there is someone more handsome than me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen you say, I\u2019m the most handsome?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just say \u2018no\u2019?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dVerndia had a sad expression, which was rare.(TN: Aiya, Verndia, pout first ehehe.)He was so funny that Psychke covered her mouth with the back of her hand and laughed.\u201cWas it like that? Well, it\u2019s fine as long as Princess is happy.\u201dVerndia grumbled at the compliment of \u2018handsome\u2019 that didn\u2019t come out no matter how long he waited.\u201cSo, what are you going to wish for?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll even do whatever it takes to be your d*mn fianc\u00e9.\u2019\u2018Even if one dies, it needs to drink. Do you understand?\u2019If it wasn\u2019t a bluff, he\u2019s been very nice to her since then.Previously, she thought it would tarnish his reputation if she died.Now that she think about it, he seems to have treated her quite sincerely.So, it would be okay to make this wish for him today.\u201cI hope the north will be stable as soon as possible.\u201dTwinkle twinkle, as if proving that she had sincerely prayed, the butterfly made with magic shone.Psychke relaxed her hand.The butterflies that circled above her head sprayed purple powder and melted into the air.Light powder fell like rain. Verndia, who had been hit with the powder, stuttered in surprise.\u201cYou know you could make a wish for yourself, so why did you make that wish?\u201dPsychke laughed and repeated what she had heard the other day.\u201cThe duke has done many things, but I have done nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you did nothing.\u201d\u201cI heard that demons have become ferocious. And that Miss Lia magic isn\u2019t having much effect.\u201dHis eyes sank low.He thought she was too busy with her own matters but she still managed to get her hands on that problem.Psychke looked away. The curtain separating the banquet hall and the terrace was swaying in the night breeze.\u201cAfter the banquet, you should go back to the north.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go right away.\u201d\u201cNo, you have to go right away.\u201dPsychke looked at him.\u201cI will do my job, and you, Duke should also do your business.\u201dHis eyes held a blank emotion.Silver hair drenched in moonlight swayed in the wind.Jrrrk, jrrk. The sound the circle makes was so peaceful.Purple powder that shimmered softly floated in the air, and her blue eyes which contained him.In this dreamy situation, she was speaking terribly realistic words.Verndia slowly pursed his lips.\u201cWhat are you trying to do by yourself?\u201d\u201cWell, it will work somehow.\u201dIt was irresponsible.However, it was also a word that could not be more suitable in the current situation.\u201cI will be fine.\u201dHe formed a thin line on his lips as a response.He knew it. He knew that without him, she would be just fine.How he loathed her. How he desperately wished she could stand on her own, and want him more. He wanted her to rely on him; that she couldn\u2019t do anything without him by her side.However, since it is impossible to express his feelings out loud, he hid his true expression behind a mask that he had worn over and over again.\u201cI\u2019m talking to the Magic Association. They also listened carefully to whether the herb matter was suspicious. There\u2019s also Shiona\u2019s case- Anyway, the princess doesn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cDuke. Don\u2019t overturn the Duke\u2019s choice because of me.\u201dIf it hadn\u2019t been for her, he would have gone back to the North as he had in the past.She didn\u2019t want to grab his ankle and prevent him from doing his business.Verndia nodded his head insincerely.\u201cYou are mistaken about something and that is it was never your fault why I haven\u2019t gone to the North.\u201dHe gapped the distance between them.They got close enough that they could see their reflections in each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cI am remaining here because I want to be by your side.\u201d\u201cSo because of me-\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe adamantly cut off her words.\u201c\u2018I\u2019 said that I wanted to be by the Princess\u2019s side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am the only one who can move me. There is no need for the princess to worry.\u201dIf he was here for her, what more could she say against it?Psychke moved her lips silently and lowered her gaze to the floor.She didn\u2019t have the confidence to look at him because if she met his eyes, he would find out what she was feeling right now.He did so and he barely uttered a word.\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\u201cOf course. But why do you hate doing it on your forehead?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had no way to escape.Verndia asked seriously.\u201cNo way you like it on the lips?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen? You\u2019re blushing. Are you embarrassed?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask me about that.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dOn the contrary, she was taken aback by his plain apology.Psychke murmured, avoiding his eyes waiting for an answer.\u201cForehead\u2026 is fine, too.\u201d\u201cThe earlier, why?\u201d\u201cDo I have to put it into words?\u201d\u201cDid you just not want to do it?\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know if he was just faking not to know or he really don\u2019t because of his calm demeanor.Psychke felt the urge to step on Verndia\u2019s feet.\u201cIs it fine to do it at this moment?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask me about that.\u201d\u201cNo, I need to know.\u201d\u201cJust don\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cPlease close your eyes.\u201d\u201cI do not want to.\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dPsychke pretended not to be able to overcome his urging and closed her eyes.Soon, warm lips fell somewhere on her face.(TN: Just why not kiss already, ugh!)* *During the rest of the banquet, Psychke met many nobles.They were mainly those who supported the crown prince and were friendly with Lestir.\u2018As expected, the nobles who support the emperor aren\u2019t coming yet.\u2019Psychke gave her gaze to the emperor\u2019s nobles who glanced at her from afar.During the gift presentation ceremony, some people were looking for an opportunity to come this way, as the emperor had taken a friendly attitude, saying, \u2018Silkisia without fail\u2019.Of course, they couldn\u2019t come to such an open place because of the notice of Logan, Duke of Silkisia.Then, someone who supported the crown prince asked about her political behavior when her status was reinstated.\u201cOf course, the princess will be with Duke Lestir, right?\u201dIt seems that the emperor considered that the fact that the traitor was not summarily executed was enough for the emperor to forgive her sins.Verndia, who took her question away, shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI don\u2019t know. The princess is also from Silkisia.\u201dHer political course should not be decided already.If she did, he never know what kind of sabotage the other side of her might do.Be as blunt as possible, even if he can\u2019t stop enemies from appearing, don\u2019t go to extremes.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we get the title back first?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess so.\u201dThe aristocrat who threw the question at the words that he used to openly attack Silkisia was worried but agreed.Since the emperor was weighing the current Silkisia and Glorielle, it was not a battle without a chance.While Verndia dealt with the nobles, Psychke did not open her mouth.She quietly listens to the conversation, only occasionally chiming in.But she managed to liven up things so as to change her incompetent image.And that strategy worked.* *After the first day, Psychke did not go to the banquet.She had met everyone she ought to, and it was easier to capture people\u2019s imagination with an occasional glimpse than a frequent one.Indeed, the rumors about Leas\u2019 daughter, \u2018Glorielle Silkisia\u2019, began to grow like a snowball.\u201cI heard she has superpowers?\u201d\u201cThey say that His Majesty the Emperor will pardon her soon.\u201d\u201cEven with such an oracle if that\u2019s enough\u2026 What will become of Silkisia now?\u201d\u201cNo, but didn\u2019t the holy water at Princess Lillian discernment also changed?\u201d\u201cHow did that happen?\u201dThe opaque future of Silkisia, one of the three major dukes of the empire, became a hot topic.Rumors got bigger whenever there were more than two people talking about it.As if to prove its soaring popularity, letters from people asking for a visit, making all sorts of excuses, flew into Lestir\u2019s memoir.\u201cBurn everything.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even worth using her abilities.He didn\u2019t look at whoever was the sender of them.Verndia gave a brief command, and the butler immediately followed.The letters were torn apart, thrown into the fireplace, and vanished.\u201cOh, I think you should see this for yourself, so I put it aside.\u201dThe butler handed Berndia a letter decorated with gold at each corner.It was the imperial family, a seal with a golden lion roaring against the backdrop of a shield.Verndia\u2019s expression changed as he roughly opened the envelope and looked at the inside.She said that she would hold a great meeting to discuss the treatment of Glory Yell.\u201cI knew it. Where\u2019s the princess? Is she in her room?\u201d\u201cUh, no. She\u2019s in the library.\u201d\u201cOh, really. She goes every chance she gets.\u201dThe footsteps that were about to go to Psychke stopped.If the Emperor hadn\u2019t been talking nonsense that day, she wouldn\u2019t be living in the library like she was now.He harrowed his brows.* *\u201cHis Majesty called me \u2018The Reincarnation of the First Silkisia.\u2019\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dThey were on the way back from the birthday banquet.It was not a good story, but she felt the need to share it, so Psychke belatedly told what she heard from the Emperor.Verndia, who was drinking water, choked after hearing her.He thumped his chest with a chuckle, forcing to say,\u201cIs he crazy, or senile at that age?\u201dPsychke waited for his cough to subside before continuing.\u201cHe said he needed my power. They said that since it was the reincarnation of the first generation, our power be the same.\u201d\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but to pass it off as senility\u2026\u201dPsychke brought up what happened when she was attacked by Shiona.He said that the reflection in the lake was the first Silkisia.The corners of her mouth curled up in thought, and then she spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But that was a nonsense.\u2018I still don\u2019t know to what extent does the emperor knows.\u2019He found that information first. He felt displeased so he frowned.\u201cIt would be good if we could find some information inside the Central Library about the first Silkisia.\u201dThe Central Library was a place in the center of the capital where all the books in the empire were collected.Psychke took his word.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to know the power of the first Silkisia. Is there such a book that records each power of people?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such a thing. There\u2019s nothing good about each power known to the world, and except for Evergreen, people with the same power do not share each other\u2019s specific powers.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together later.\u201dAfter the Magic Association incident, he didn\u2019t let Psychke wander around alone.He couldn\u2019t be with her all the time so he always sends Crow and Croa but she always finds them and asks Isolet to put them down.Psychke shook her head.\u201cI am all right. I will look for myself.\u201dVerndia will suffer the most since he was with the \u2018criminal\u2019 inside the Second Prince\u2019s banquet at that. Besides, what is such a help when it was easy to navigate in the library? He wanted to stop her, saying that it\u2019s risky to go alone but he was blocked by the words that followed,\u201cIf I get hurt again, I\u2019ll wear a bell. The one with the yellow ribbon you bought for me back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Not the yellow one, but the red one.\u201dSo, Psychke went to the library alone.* * *\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201dUpon returning late at night from the library, she was greeted by Verndia warmly and he checked if she got any injuries, muttering in a slightly sullen tone.\u201cYou are fine.

What did you say?\u201d\u201cNothing. Did you find out anything?\u201d\u201cThere was nothing special today. But-\u201dPsychke pulled her note from her pocket.\u201cLooking at it, there was something like a rumor, so I wrote it down.\u201d\u201cRumor?\u201dHe took the note and confirmed it with her.\u300c The first Silkisia was very close to Lestir.Yet were married to different people. \u300d\u300c Silkisia\u2019s spouse was the first Emperor.After their marriage, the imperial family and Lestir\u2019s relationship became very estranged. \u300d\u300c Periodically, Silkisia travels to the North to see Lestir.However, at some point, she stopped going to the North altogether. \u300d\u300cIt was said that she died because of disease, but she actually died while wandering in the snowy fields of the North in a daze. \u300d\u300cThere are accounts of Lestir raising an army after Silksia\u2019s death and marching on the imperial capital, but there was no evidence. \u300d\u300cIt was unlikely that the Empire would allow a family to rebel against them. \u300d\u201cThe last two sentences were definitely new to me.\u201d\u201cI think I have checked every book there was. So, I am planning to ask Duke Evergreen but I doubt if he\u2019d answer.\u201dEven if he does answer, he was a hostile person.Her smaller body was not even helping her, but it was obvious that Duke Evergreen would neglect that.\u2018Well, as Miss Stella said, he likes perfume.\u2019No matter how much she try to make an appointment, he won\u2019t accept it. It\u2019s hard to even meet, so what should she do?\u201cRight, princess.\u201dVerndia, who had taken care of her notes, changed her subject.\u201cSoon, there\u2019d be a conference meeting on how to deal with you, Princess. You can go there yourself, or should I just tell you the results? Which are you comfortable with?\u201d\u201cI will go myself.\u201d\u201cAs long as the Duke of Silkisia is also present, I don\u2019t think it will sound good. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cSure. It\u2019s my job, I have to go.\u201dPsychke answered without hesitation and clenched her fists.Since she was still a sinner, she had no right to speak at the meeting, but she wanted to witness what would the outcome be.As if she knew it would come out like that, Verndia silently nodded his head.* * *It was muggy at dawn in late summer.It was deep inside the imperial garden.The flowers were in full bloom in the garden, but without paying attention, Logan only looked at the emperor\u2019s back as he walked ahead.Before the Second Prince\u2019s banquet, when the news of Glorielle started to spread, he asked for an audience with the Emperor to which he declined.Then, today, when the conference meeting was going to be held, and the Emperor wanted to see how the wind would blow this time so he appeared.He just walked for an hour and didn\u2019t say anything.If that\u2019s the case, why did he want to see him? It\u2019s time for the great conference to begin soon.Logan couldn\u2019t stand it and opened his mouth.\u201cYour majesty.\u201dSuddenly, the tree branches stepped on by the emperor made a harsh sound.He stepped onto something he shouldn\u2019t have. The emperor indicated for him to shut up.The flesh he had been biting for an hour tasted like blood already.It was not enough time to prepare for the meeting, so what the hell was he doing now?\u201cDo you think that preparing a little more will make a difference?\u201dSuddenly the question seemed to penetrate his thoughts.It was a question, but a sarcastic tone.His heart was twisted, but Logan couldn\u2019t say anything as the opponent was the Emperor himself.The emperor spoke again.\u201cI would like to choose you and not Glorielle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI was thinking about it.\u201dThe emperor stopped in front of a fountain from which a statue of white ivory spouted water.Half-turned, he stared coolly at the stiff Duke.\u201cThe reason why I should choose you over Glorielle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut nothing came to mind.\u201dThe Emperor ruthlessly scanned Logan\u2019s face, then moved his gaze toward the fountain.His voice was usually sharp, but it sounded even colder today to which Logan clenched his fists.\u201cThat child cannot use her powers, but I can grant your wishes with forbidden magic.\u201d\u201cForbidden magic?\u201dThe emperor laughed when he remembered the eternal life magic circle that was never completed.It was an obvious laugh.\u201cYou mean Shiona. Is she even still alive?\u201d\u201cShe is not a woman who dies so easily.\u201dLogan answered, yet he was not confident because his opponent was Lestir.In fact, he knew not too long ago that Shiona had fought against Berndia.He wondered why the proud Magic Association didn\u2019t claim compensation from Lester who blew up the building.A few days ago, he realized it after seeing the association\u2019s announcement, \u2018Thank you to Duke Lestir for finding the hidden worshipper.\u2019That there was some connection between the collapse of the association building and his loss of contact with Shiona.\u201cShe was still looking for a place to settle in so please wait a little longer-\u201d\u201cWhether that little bit will be 10 years or 20 years.\u201dThe bony sound made Logan shut his mouth.He knew that this alone would not change the emperor\u2019s mind.He opened and closed his fists nervously. After some thought, he opened his mouth again, wondering why he remembered it only now.\u201cYou must never keep that child around you to prevent chaos. Thus, this is the right thing to do with this chance.\u201dThe emperor, who had been staring at the fountain, finally turned to Logan. He was still a numb pupil as if he were looking at things.Here, even a wrong word could mean the ignition of wwar, so Logan chose his words as carefully as possible.\u201cI dare not harm Your Majesty, but there is no harm in doubting anything.\u201dThe second prince\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony was slowly coming to an end.The emperor, who said he would hold an oracle-related meeting as soon as his birthday banquet was over, was silent.He does not know if the main character of that oracle was Psychke, but if this goes on, his justification of burying this child would vanish.Logan persuaded the emperor with all his zeal.\u201cEven more so, she was the daughter of Leas. Her lineage cannot be fooled, and there was a high possibility that she would follow the same path as her mother, ignoring the grace of His Majesty who bestowed her with kindness.\u201d\u201cThe same thing\u2026\u201dThe emperor meaningfully lengthened the tail of his horse.Logan recognized the meaning, but his expression did not change.\u201cYes. So, it seems right to keep a distance from her before it becomes the seed of trouble.\u201d\u201cIf someone can handle her well, she wouldn\u2019t be the speck of dust, let alone the seed of trouble.\u201dA single word was enough to break Logan\u2019s long persuasion.The Emperor muttered to the frozen Logan.\u201cTake a closer look. Since what was given away was not enough and cannot be recovered, was destroying her the only countermeasure for current Silkisia?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected, fakes are different. I thought it would be similar since I inherited at least a little of Shia\u2019s blood.\u201dThe emperor made no secret of his disappointment.Logan finally realized what answer the Emperor was expecting.It was beyond his ability, and without Shiona, it would be close to impossible, but he couldn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t, so Logan swallowed dryly.And he said something that would appeal to the emperor.\u201cI will return Psychke to Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI have the means to separate her from Lestir.\u201dThere was something he heard from Marquis Esland, who had recently come to borrow money.He also heard it from his daughter, Hilvia. It was not yet confirmed if what he heard was true, but it was said that Lestir has a high chance of falling in love with Psychke.\u201cEven if it was not the case, this was what I was trying to present during the meeting.\u201dLogan lowered his voice, making sure no one was around to eavesdrop.However, despite the effort, the emperor who had heard the story was still blunt.\u201cDo you think Lestir will just fall apart with that?\u201d\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t fall right away, it\u2019s enough to create a crack and when there\u2019s a crack, the rest would be easier.\u201dDing- Ding- Ding-In the distance, the bell rang announcing that the start of the conference was approaching.The Emperor glared at Logan with a look that said he didn\u2019t expect much.And he turned his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Back in time, Lennox forgot some materials he needed in this room and she scrambled to get in on time for him.\u2018Why are you here?\u2019But what returned to her was his contempt. Lennox said that the meeting was already over and that she should have come sooner. He even threw the data and cursed.Enduring his words, she went home and unexpectedly, she was greeted with rain and got wet. The material she managed to organize disappeared like a sandcastle. At that time, she had an idea; of stopping what she had been doing until then.And like a running wagon\u2026\u201cWhat are you doing not going in?\u201dWith that voice, she turned her head.That day, and even now.Standing next to me was a man who shined just by his existence like a star in the night sky.She slowly blinked her eyes and replied slowly.\u201cI was waiting to come in with you.\u201d\u201cI know when you will come.\u201d\u201c\uc5b8\uc81c \uc62c \uc904 \uc54c\uace0.\u201dEven if he said so, he was still happy to wait.

It was so obvious that it wasn\u2019t even funny.\u201dAs soon as they arrived at the conference hall, the Crown Prince asked to see them briefly.\u2018It seemed like he wanted the princess to be brought here somehow.\u2019Verndia found it quite funny.When Verndia said he had no intention of breaking up his marriage with Psychke, he said he was the Emperor\u2019s dog and now, what would he spew?Ding- Ding- Ding-A bell rang to announce that the meeting was about to begin.He felt sorry that Psychke had to go this.\u201cLike I said, you\u2019d be listening to some nonsense discussion, and I feel sorry for that. That\u2019s far I could do as of the moment.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. And\u2026\u201dShe wanted to say that everything was well as long as he was by her side but saying it out loud felt embarrassing.\u201cNothing, let\u2019s go.\u201dAverting her eyes, he held his arms tightly.He laughed at the increased warmth.* * *The Grand Conference was held irregularly whenever there was a major event in the empire.The nobles who support the emperor sit on the left side of the throne in the center, and the nobles who support the crown prince sit on the right.At the opposite end of the throne sits neutral aristocrats.When Psychke entered, the eyes of the seated nobles turned to her.It was only natural that this political course would change depending on where she sat.\u201cThis way.\u201dVerndia led her to a seat, which do not belong to either side.It was the farthest place from the throne and was used for the purpose of educating young members of the royal family or high-ranking nobles.It was a good place to stand out because there was no decision-making power, but a voice.\u201cW, why are you here?\u201dLennox, who was sitting first, was startled.He didn\u2019t think she would follow to the right side.\u201cDo you have any problem?\u201dVerndia looked at Lennox with a slightly opened eye.It was an expression that, if someone unfamiliar to him saw it, they would assume that he was asking because he was really curious.\u201cN, no.\u201dHowever, almost fidgeting, Lennox hurriedly averted his gaze from him, as if he had seen a monster.Then, as soon as Verndia led her a seat, he moved to the seat farthest from Psychke.Either that or not, Psychke just stared blankly at Verndia\u2019s back as he went to the right.He might have been an ordinary nobleman, but Verndia was like the head of the Crown Prince faction.It was not good for such a person to be in the audience,\u2018Even in a situation like this, if she stays with Duke Lestir, there has already decided on a faction.\u2019It wasn\u2019t long before the empty seats were filled.The Emperor, who sat down for the last time, declared the opening of the Great Conference.\u201cThe reason I called you here today was.\u201dThe warm, gray gaze reached Psyche and the rest of the nobles looked at her, too.\u201cTo decide how to deal with the criminal Glorielle.\u201dAlthough holding a great meeting to decide the treatment of one person was not enough to be called a criminal in itself.As if trying to overpower the opponent, the emperor called her that.\u201cDuke of Lestir.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVerndia, who had been called, looked at the emperor.His purple eyes were frozen cold.\u201cGlorielle\u2019s sins would be in accordance of this conference.\u201dTwo pairs of cold eyes bit each other.\u201cNo matter what the outcome was, the crime that brought the sinner to the auspicious place will be questioned.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dThe emperor, whose words were strangely flowing, shifted his gaze. He licked his red lips as he swept across his seat.\u201cLet me speak.\u201d\u201cI will go first.\u201dVerndia opened the meeting, effortlessly closing his legs.\u201cI\u2019m going to clear Glorielle\u2019s name and return Silkisia\u2019s castle to her-\u201d\u201cA pardon for an imperial murderer, what kind of nonsense is that?\u201dAn aristocrat on the left hastily intervened him but as soon as meeting Verndia\u2019s eyes, he shut his mouth and lowered his tail. After that, he continued to speak,\u201c- And demands that Silkisia\u2019a name to be returned.\u201d\u201cThat sounds absurd.\u201dPeople who normally wouldn\u2019t risk being bitten by a mad dog jump in with both feet when their position was at stake. Verndia looked at the Marquis of Esland across from him with his unfamiliar eyes.\u201cHas the Duke really forgotten the events of twenty years ago, which nearly caused the death of her Majesty; and this disgrace would continue if not be punished -\u201d\u201cDo you remember what the Marquis did when he was three years old?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think it was normal to be punished over something you can\u2019t even remember doing?\u201d\u201cThe Duke\u2019s words seem to be overly emotional.\u201dBaron Hillace opened his mouth, sitting next to Logan,\u201cWhoever bears the family name has an obligation to take responsibility for the family. Glorielle did not fulfill her duty-\u201d\u201cWhat duty does a three-year-old have?!\u201dThe person sitting in the seat on the right, supporting the crown prince, screamed.He was an aristocrat who was known for his hot-tempered nature and the bloodstains on his neck.\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate if you say obligation properly. I am sure no one hasn\u2019t raised their child properly\u2014\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Count without an heir?\u201d\u201cI am not infertile like everyone think!\u201d\u201cA noble is a noble whether of her age.\u201dThe subject that was about to turn into a personal attack was cut off by someone on the left.Starting with that, words went on and away.\u201cA noble is a noble only after a few years later. Saying this is a bit\u2014\u201d\u201cWhen did I say that three-year-olds are not nobles?\u201d\u201cIf you are a noble, you must follow the duties of a noble!\u201d\u201cDuty. Will the Count slap a three-year-old as punishment?\u201d\u201cIs it like this?\u201d\u201cAs she gets older, she will think differently. She was at an age where she doesn\u2019t know what she was doing\u2014\u201d\u201cYou keep talking about her age, so will the Marquis forgive a three-year-old if she sets a house on fire, saying it\u2019s okay because she was young?\u201d\u201cThat and this are different! Wasn\u2019t it Glorielle who committed the actual incident?\u201d\u201cWhy do you not know that the parents\u2019 sins are the children\u2019s?\u201d\u201cGlorielle was merely three at the time. Because her parents committed a crime at an age when he didn\u2019t know anything-\u201d\u201cThat is the law of the Empire.\u201d\u201cAccording to the law, Glorielle should have died long ago.\u201d\u201cSo, she should be grateful that he is not dead. Where did you dare get that pardon from\u2026\u201dThe aristocrats were anxious, glimpsing at him, scared that he\u2019d be out of control since he was the one to bring out the amnesty.He crossed his arms, and tapped his feet aggressively.With his short temper, he wanted to burn all those who insulted the Princess, but now was not the time for her to reveal her true nature.\u2018In the future, I need to pick out those who\u2019ll make trouble.\u2019He engraved in his head those who insisted on extremes, saying, \u2018Amnesty is absolutely not allowed, Glorielle must die immediately.\u2019This was why he didn\u2019t get straight to the point, but instead made an appeal to emotion.To call out those who were rampaging without reading the mainstream. Then, as the fight reached its climax, he let out a short gasp.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe nobles who had been talking loudly shut their mouths in an instant. Rather, Verndia lazily leaned back on the backrest. And briefly dismissed the conclusions reached so far.\u201cGlorielle must die for the sins of her parents when he was only three years old. Since that was the law and order of the empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cLaw and order.\u201dHe laughed.\u201cUpright words. If you are a citizen of the Empire, these are of course things you must protect. If you don\u2019t obey, you will be punished. Yes, it was a natural proposition.\u201dHe raised one corner of his mouth.\u201cThen, was obeying the law a natural proposition?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSome understood, yet some didn\u2019t.And one of the latter muttered.\u201cNo\u2026 I guess.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dVerndia concluded his words meaningfully, right after silence fell in the meeting room.Those who understood waited for someone to ask, while those who did not understand were intent on figuring out their intentions.In the meantime, a noble, who was seated at the prince\u2019s side, finally opened her mouth.He was a hot-tempered count who personally attacked Hillace for being infertile.\u201cAre you saying that Glorielle is not guilty at all, rather than pretending not to be guilty?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how much you care for Glorielle, denying the incident from 20 years ago is-\u201d\u201cCould I do this without any evidence?\u201dHe tilted his head sarcastically.\u201cThe Duke is overreacting. I just told the truth, but you\u2019re in denial.\u201d\u201cDo you know anything about it then?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThese were the words he said vaguely.Before the meeting, he could have visited Lillian and snatched her necklace, but he did not.The first was that Psychke did not want him to intervene in Silkisia\u2019s affairs.The second reason was that as long as the emperor was present, Leas\u2019 name could not be cleared even if he had the necklace.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ask for a reinvestigation?\u201dAs expected, the emperor stepped forward.Verndia resisted the urge to respond to the Emperor with, \u2018Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u2019\u201cI couldn\u2019t spend Your Majesty\u2019s time on something I\u2019m not even sure about.\u201d\u201cNot sure, then, now?\u201d\u201cNow-\u201d\u201cI will take responsibility for the investigation together with Duke Lestir.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhat kind of trick was this again?Verndia turned his head towards the sound and it was Logan who spoke softly.\u201cEven though you say that, as the head of Silkisia, I can\u2019t sit still. This time, I will make it clear so that there are no unsavory rumors.\u201dVerndia hadn\u2019t expected Silkisia, the last place he wanted to be, to take an active role in the Leas case.But, he judged.\u2018I\u2019ll take care of it, so I\u2019m telling you to shut up.\u2019The perpetrator of the Leas case was the former Silkisia, and the victim was the imperial family.Although he was betrothed to Psyche, a descendant of the former Silkisia, strictly speaking, Verndia was an outsider who had nothing to do with the case.So, if he wanted to step out of present-day Silkisia, he had no reason to intervene.He doesn\u2019t know if it was because he was the one looking for Psychke, the person who was actually in charge of her.\u2018Because even the princess said she wanted to solve it herself anyway.\u2019Logan\u2019s attitude was displeased, but he roughly accepted it and moved on.There was no intention of holding a battle for the truth about the Leas incident here.The meeting hall fell silent as Verndia shut his mouth.Assuming that Leas was really innocent, each started to roll their brains.\u201cIt would be good to rest for a while.\u201dThe emperor declared a break in the endless silence.* *\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\u201cIs Leas really framed?\u201dAristocrats gathered around Verndia like a cloud.Even those who were not on good terms with him cast curious glances, even from a distance butVerndia replied leisurely.\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019d like to reveal here.\u201dThen, after getting out of the crowd of nobles, he approached Psychke, who was standing at a distance, and spoke to him in a whisper.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you listen to something displeasing.\u201d\u201cNo, I insisted to come anyway.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dEven though she was okay, he kept apologizing. As if to soothe a crying person, he held her cheek with his large hand.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dPsychke raised the corner of her mouth. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to smile.It was then.\u201cGasp!\u201dA nobleman who was talking on the other side looked at the two and sighed.Realizing that he had made a mistake, he hurriedly looked away, but it was too late.Verndia frowned.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cOh, no, nothing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201dThe people around him were taken aback by his remarks that were not aristocratic.Knowing that Verndia\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t good, he avoided it.The path to the nobleman parted like a sea opening instantly.Berndia strode towards him.\u201cI asked what do you want.\u201d\u201cN, no, th, that.\u201d\u201cIs it necessary to have a mouth that cannot answer questions?\u201d\u201cNo, I will tell you. I will tell you everything!\u201dThe nobleman waved his hand at the formidable threat.He looked at Psychke behind Verndia with fearful eyes, trembling and said something like a plea.\u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I heard. My thoughts are not mixed in the slightest.\u201dVerndia nodded his head to mean that he understood.He was slowly feeling the limit of his patience at the answer that didn\u2019t come right away.The noblrman, who had grown pale with an even worse expression, stammered.\u201cTh, that\u2026 To say that Princess Psyche has another man\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat bull****.\u201dAnother man, nonsense. Even if he tried hard next to him, she\u2019d be just annoyed.Verndia\u2019s momentum became vicious. Anger at that nonsese sparked a perfect bottom line.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d\u201cNo, I did not do that!\u201d\u201cWho did it?\u201dWith quick motions, he pointed to a nearby nobleman.The designated aristocrat hurriedly waved his hand.\u201cI heard that, too!\u201d\u201cTo whom.\u201dHis finger pointed to the other.After taking a few steps like that, Berndia was able to meet the source of the rumor.It was the Marquis of Esland.Surprisingly, he readily apologized.\u201cI think my daughter said it wrong when she was talking with me. My apologies.\u201d\u201cWrong?\u201dVerndia laughed openly.There was no way a man of the rank of a marquis would make a mistake in a place like this.It must have been to damage Psychke\u2019s reputation and to create a rift in her relationship with him.\u201cYou almost got a man killed. You live an easy life, Marquis.\u201d\u201cYou almost killed him.\u201d\u201cIt must have been a political question.\u201d\u201cCould that be? But I am just telling the truth.\u201d\u201cHonestly?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDespite the ferocious eyes, the Marquis of Esland only flinched and did not change his words.Verndia growled.\u201cWhat facts?\u201d\u201cPrincess Psychke is having a relationship with another man.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you know a relationship I don\u2019t even know.\u201dPsychke stood in front of Berndia who was about to step out with his actions.\u201cDoes the Marquis know who that man was?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d know best, but I do know that you had a secret affair on the 12th day of the second month of Vicente.\u201dThe aristocrats who had been listening on the specific date were agitated.Did Princess Psychke really have another man?Then, how was her relationship with Duke Lestir? Doesn\u2019t that mean they don\u2019t have it anymore?\u2018The second month, the 12th.\u2019\u2018The second month, the 12th.\u2019Psychke chewed on the date.It was the day she hid her identity and infiltrated the auction house with Verndia.Lillian said that she had left the house and hadn\u2019t returned, so she wondered if Hilvia had put on enough weight.She couldn\u2019t understand the attitude of the Marquis, who seemed overly confident to be so.\u2018Isn\u2019t it too risky to just believe what his daughter says and attack her in a public place like this?\u2019Psychke answered calmly.\u201cNever before.\u201d\u201cThere was a witness who said she saw the princess that day.\u201dThe words of the Marquis that followed were quite specific.Someone said they saw a silver-haired woman entering an inn with a certain man around 2:00 in the morning.At first, she thought she was just a lover wandering around late at night, but at the word \u2018Silkisia\u2019 that came across her, she knew that the woman was Princess Psychke, she voiced out.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only Princess of Silkisia.\u201d\u201cPrincess Lillian said she went to bed early. The only one who vacated her house at that time that day was the princess.\u201d\u2018You believed Lillian?\u2019The question rose to the top of her throat and then disappeared.It\u2019s not going to turn the tide, and it\u2019d end up feeling like she was trying to pin the blame on the good guy.So, in this case, you must make a claim based on facts, not appeal to emotion.\u2018Although the lack of witnesses was a problem.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to claim that the princess has two bodies.\u201dWill she have no witnesses?Shocked inside her, Psychke only rolled her eyes and looked at Verndia.Surprisingly, he had a relaxed expression.The Marquis of Esland\u2019s face was puzzled.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAt that time, the Princess was with me.\u201dThe Marquis\u2019 eyes widened.It wasn\u2019t because he believed Verndia\u2019s words, it was because he didn\u2019t think that such a fault would be covered up. Verndia sneered.\u201cI think that was a lie, but there are witnesses.\u201d\u201cEven if we put the person of Lestir in the spotlight-\u201d\u201cI saw it.\u201dAs if waiting, a young man with ultramarine blue hair raised his hand.At the impossible story, Psychke reflexively turned her head.The man who raised his hand was the first person she had ever seen. No, if she look closely, he seemed to be someone she had seen somewhere.\u201cCount Luan?\u201dMarquis Esland\u2019s startled voice echoed in the air.Luan, Luan family supports the emperor and they don\u2019t get along with Lestir, too.\u2018Why is he helping me?\u2019And why is the duke looking at Count Luan with an obvious face?\u201cTo take a short break during swordsmanship practice, I look at my watch and go out to remember. I clearly saw the two of you walking along the lakeside around 2:00 in the morning.\u201d\u201cI said so.\u201dVerndia shrugged his shoulders.Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the Marquis of Esland.If it wasn\u2019t Princess Psychke, then the question of who the silver-haired Silkisian woman the witness had seen was.\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe Marquis of Esland withdrew his foot in panic.But no one here knows the answer.Someone muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that the Duke of Silkisia isn\u2019t here.\u201dIn the meantime, Marquis Esland, who was trying to escape quietly, was called, and stopped by Verndia.\u201cWhere are you going, Marquis?\u201dA cool smile hung on his lips.\u201cYou almost killed someone and trying to get away with it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My daughter\u2019s words-\u201d\u201cGlorielle.\u201dShe cut off his words and corrected, drawing the eyes of others to her.\u201cCall me Glorielle.\u201dDespite that her real identity was revealed, he still called her Psychke? It must be because they do not recognize her as a direct descendant of Silkisia.After correcting the Marquise\u2019s mistake, his expression turned sour since that name and title overwhelms him.If Psychke were to be called as Glorielle as she wanted, it would be like losing a hand.The Marquis was reluctant, but he changed his words because he had committed a crime, and Verndia growled from behind Psychke, saying,\u201cLet\u2019s do this quickly.\u201d\u201cMy apologies, Princess Glorielle. I was careless for believing only what my daughter said.\u201dThe gazes of the nobles who were watching the commotion reached him, gossiping that he had been defeated by Glorielle, who actually has no title and was even a criminal.Sensing those gazes from behind, the marquis\u2019 face turned red with shame.But Psychke did not end there.\u201cAh, I almost forgot.\u201dShe moved her steps, brought her body closer and lowered her voice so that only the marquise could hear.\u201cI know that Lady Hilvia has put in a ridiculous request to the craft shop.\u201dThe Marquis\u2019 face turned pale.He knew, indeed, the outrageousness of his daughter\u2019s behavior. And so to silence it down, he offered a lot of money. Yet, Psychke summed it up in one word.\u201cI will watch her.\u201dIt means that if you don\u2019t want your whole family to be destroyed because of copying the poison dart necklace, you should take care of yourself.Ding- Ding- Ding-Just then, the bell rang signaling the restart of the meeting.Leaving behind the desperately standing Marquis of Esland, she departed.* * *\u201cHave you sorted out your thoughts?\u201dThe emperor, seated in the highest seat, relaxed, and rhymed.Everyone only glanced at Verndia and Logan, but did not open their mouths easily.In the meantime, Marquis Esland finally opened fire. His face was still white as if the shock hadn\u2019t gone away.\u201cUntil the Leas case is sorted out, Psyc\u2026 I don\u2019t think you should blame Princess Glorielle.\u201d\u201cMarquis Esland?\u201d\u201cNow what?\u201dSurprised by the different attitude from before the break, the nobles on the emperor\u2019s side murmured.Even Logan, who was sitting proudly, looked embarrassed.The Marquis averted their gaze.\u201cUnless we\u2019re mistaken, this was brought to our attention by the Duke of Lestir himself, and no one else. I don\u2019t think we should rush to judgment until we know the outcome.\u201dAlthough Esland was sitting in a pile of debt, his family was established by assisting the emperor over the past several generations.It was a statement that could not be easily ignored.The shocked imperial aristocrats became noisy.Opinions went back and forth as to whether he was doing this to cover up the rumors he had uttered just a moment ago, or whether it was too much to say so.Verndia crossed his legs and gave a sweet smile.\u201cI listened to the Marquis. According to what you said, she is not a criminal until the truth is revealed, so she will become \u2018Glorielle Silkysia\u2019 instead of \u2018Glorielle\u2019.\u201dIt was a name that was taken away for committing a crime, so it was only natural that it would return if there were no sins. Esland has a positive silence.\u201cNo, that is nonsense!\u201dBefore the break, the aristocrat who was actively opposing Glorielle\u2019s pardon let out a scream-like sound.\u201cTwo bloodlines in one family. There has never been anything like this in history!\u201d\u201cStrictly speaking, they are not two bloodlines.\u201dA raspy voice rang from the highest place.The Emperor looked down at Logan with arrogant eyes.\u201cIsn\u2019t she your daughter?\u201dLogan said nothing.He was expecting the meeting to go like this.However, she did not know that the emperor would push Psychke so openly.The emperor turned his eyes away from the trembling duke and indifferently scanned the audience.\u201cIt seems to have been sorted out. Any disagreements?\u201dVerndia thought that saying anything useless.The opening of the grand meeting today was just an assortment.The emperor originally intended to give the princess her last name back.\u2018It\u2019s unpleasant.\u2019It\u2019s true that it was what he wanted, but he frowned at the unpleasant feeling of being played in the Emperor\u2019s hands.Right then.There was someone who broke the stillness enough to hear even a needle drop.\u201cI-I\u2026\u201dLennox hesitated to continue, stammering out the words and faltered.Not only did he feel the stares of the nobles who had gathered around him, but he was now looking directly into the eyes of Emperor.Logan\u2019s eyes widened at his son\u2019s insanity. The water was too spilled to dry.You brought something you didn\u2019t want to bring on the condition that you stay calm, and you\u2019re creating a fuss!\u201cThat, so\u2026\u201dThe words he couldn\u2019t spit out were blocked.It was the first time I had always given his opinion based on what he heard from Psychke.Even though he was afraid, he mustered up the courage to think that the meeting would not end like this.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t courage, it was bravery.\u201cOracle\u2026 Isn\u2019t there an oracle?\u201d\u201cOracle?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dHe has a clear picture in my head of how he want to talk about what he heard from Psychke, but he don\u2019t know why this one was so jumbled.Lennox rambled on, unaware that he was the one who had organized it for him to understand.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but they say it\u2019s related to names, and Psychke, no, Glorielle was a name related to glory like an oracle-\u201d\u201cDoes the Duke think I would kneel before a mere princess?\u201dIt was a tone of clear displeasure.Lennox shuddered and shut his mouth. He curled up his lips and he stuttered again.\u201cI don\u2019t mean that-\u201d\u201cSo, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just out of concern for you-\u201d\u201cYou are cheeky.\u201dWorrying about someone was possible only when you are in a better position than that person.Lennox didn\u2019t realize it.But he turned pale as he realized he had done something wrong at the emperor\u2019s sharper tone.Logan hurriedly got up from his seat and bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty. It was my fault for educating my children incorrectly.\u201dThat figure didn\u2019t match the title of duke in the slightest, so Verndia clicked his tongue.His face was then crumpled after hearing a voice out of nowhere.\u201cBut Your Majesty, Prince Lennox had a point.\u201dWhere did that guy come out from?\u201cIf even those with discernment are so confused, I believe that if Princess Psychke\u2019s original name is made public, disloyal people will try to take advantage of it.\u201dThat man didn\u2019t even care about Verndia\u2019s staring eyes.Widnix only looked directly at the emperor.The emperor, who blinked slowly at the unexpected intervention, opened his mouth.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI would like to tell you that it is still untimely.\u201d\u201cIs the right time coming then?\u201dVerndia asked crookedly.Widnix\u2019s numb eyes turned to him.\u201cAccording to the Duke\u2019s words, shouldn\u2019t we live with our breath until it was revealed that she have nothing to do with the oracle?\u201d\u201cMaybe she could just disclose that she was not affiliated with the trust.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this, since you know best that it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\u201cThen do you have any way of proving she was not affiliated with the Oracle?\u201dThe light green eyes disappeared and reappeared beneath his eyelids.Widnix said with a nonchalant expression.\u201cIt was \u2018The Glory that Lost Light,\u2019 the protagonist of the first oracle.\u201dVerndia, with her arms crossed, tilted his head in annoyance.\u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t it be better to make it not fall under that formula?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt means that we can bring back the lost light.\u201dIt\u2019s not even a pun, that\u2019s what it was.Verndia twitched his brows, tried to say something. However, Widnix was quicker to follow his words.\u201cPrincess was still using the surname of Silkisia as \u2018Psyche Silkisia\u2019. Therefore, simply becoming \u2018Glorielle Silkisia\u2019 cannot be said to have regained the lost light. Unless she received a real nobility.\u201dLogan was stunned at the end of fainting.Dealing with only one Lestir was daunting, but it went all the way to Evergreen\u2026Contrary to his thoughts, however, Widnix did not ask Psychke to return the dukedom.Although he said something similar.\u201cDo you know how a fallen noble can receive a title?\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201dBeing so dumbfounded, Verndia let out a gasp and asked a question.If it was someone else, he would have told them to stop talking nonsense, but that guy was a walking history book.\u2018Have you used that kind of method in relation to oracles in the past?\u2019He had a suspicion.The emperor, who had been listening quietly, answered.\u201cYou mean to give her a chance to prove.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting comment.\u201dUsually, those who are judged as dangerous people are not given a chance.Take away everything and thoroughly trample it so that it can never stand up again.However, Widnix wanted to reduce Psychke\u2019s risk and asked her to increase her strength.It was a stark contradiction.\u201cCan you take responsibility?\u201dWidnix did not answer.And the emperor did not expect his answer from the beginning.The one who gives the opinion and the one who accepts it are complete strangers. Responsibility was not something that can be borne by others.He asked someone other than Widnix.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dPsychke raised her eyes at the sudden question.She was lost in her thoughts, not knowing whether Widnix was trying to help or hinder her.\u201cIf I gave you a sword, what would you do with it?\u201dThe perfect answer was to use it for His Majesty the Emperor.But Psychke didn\u2019t want to do that.She didn\u2019t want to say that she would offer her allegiance even if it was a lie.She replied back saying that no matter what happened, it wouldn\u2019t move according to your will.\u201cI have never held a sword, hence, I have no words.\u201dHe liked that over-the-top boldness.The blue eyes that were blazing with a certain determination were also very pretty.So, it had to be mine, not Lestir\u2019s.The emperor smiled as he recalled her way of having her.\u201cGo north.\u201d\u201c\u2026! The North is-\u201dVerndia intervened but the Emperor neglected him.\u201cGo and do something that everyone will appreciate. Then I\u2019ll give you a title.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cReceive it.\u201dThe emperor gave a warning to the prompt reply that seemed to have been waiting.\u201cHaving a chance means taking responsibility even when you fail.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cGive me three months.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d* * *In the end, Glorielle\u2019s treatment was three months later.It was concluded that Psychke would be re-determined depending on what kind of achievements she had made in the North.As soon as the meeting was over, Psychke looked for Widnix.He happened to be close to the neutral area, so he was easy to spot.He was ignoring the nobles who were talking to him and heading down the quiet hallway.\u201cDuke Evergreen!\u201dThe footsteps, which did not stop no matter who called, stopped at Psychke\u2019s call.Slowly, with an unreadable expression on his face, he turned back.Psychke asked directly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hate me?\u201d\u201cI hate you.\u201dWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, he answered immediately.Psychke, not hurt by those words, asked a question.\u201cThen why did you do that?\u201dOriginally, at today\u2019s great meeting, she only intended to recover the name \u2018Glorielle Silkisia\u2019.To fight Logan in earnest, she must have strength.Although Lestir had her back, she was not in her own power, so she tried other means.However, since the emperor had given her a place like this, she did not have to look for other means.Widnix, who paused for a while, asked back.\u201cYour eyes\u2026 Aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, instigating the emperor to make him meritorious, it was not to help her-\u201cYou did it on purpose. You know I won\u2019t be able to go to the North.\u201d\u201cIt gave me a surprise.\u201dWidnix readily admitted.\u201cBut since the things had come to this, it\u2019s not a bad idea to go to the North.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cGo, and don\u2019t come back.\u201dHis cold fingers touched the nape of her neck, as if wanting to caress it, but dropped it after a moment.\u201cI hate you, Princess. But I don\u2019t want you to die, either.\u201dPsychke looked at him from a distance. And, as he was about to leave, she reflexively opened her mouth.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI thought Verndia\u2019s survival was better than yours, Princess, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201dVoicing that, he left her with seemingly incomprehensible words with a tinge of loneliness.Then, like someone who remembered something he had forgotten, he stopped on his big feet.\u201cI heard from Verndia that you\u2019re suffering from the side effects of the Beast\u2019s Blessing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI will solve it. I will reach out to you, but don\u2019t ever go with Verndia.\u201d\u201cWidnix! You son of a b**ch!\u201d\u201cI shall, then.\u201dWidnix went on his way, ignoring Verndia, who was running towards him with rough footsteps.He was about to come as soon as it was over, but I was late because the emperor held me back and said that he would send the knights unconditionally. He was about to chase the two immediately but the Emperor held him back, saying that he would send the knights unconditionally. He glared at Widnix, despite that his back was in front of Verndia\u2019s menacing look.\u201cWhat kind of b*llsh*t is that guy talking about- No, more than that, Princess\u2026\u201dHe grabbed her arms, lowering his voice so only she could hear him.\u201cYou can\u2019t go to the North.\u201d\u201cI can.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else for now.\u201dThere were several eyes watching them so he agreed to her request.* * *\u2018Five.\u2019Swish\u2018Six.\u2019Swish\u2018Seven.\u2019Whiick- Paak!\u201cUgh.\u201dPsychke groaned as the wooden sword struck her in the stomach. She tried to endure it but it was painful after quite a while. Verndia was sorry that he hurt her, letting out a pained sound.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes I\u2019m okay. I will do it again.\u201dShe straightened her broken stance.She bit her lip to try to contain her throbbing pain, and pointed the wooden sword at him where she felt his presence. Her eyes were covered so she couldn\u2019t see anything, but feel the presence.Following her insistence, Verndia proceeded to do a few more sums.In the distance, hired hands threw fist-sized rocks, and as Psyche dodged them, they slashed at her without warning with wooden swords.Pak!\u201cUgh!\u201dThe fit didn\u2019t sound good.She didn\u2019t let go of her sword, but her arm which holds her sword drooped down.As he caught her when she stumbled, he said.\u201cThat\u2019s all for today.\u201dThe stone-throwing servants bowed and retreated. And Verndia removed the black cloth covering Psychke\u2019s eyes. Her eyes slowly turned bright, adjusting to the light. The first thing she saw was a man who looked at her with a light sigh.Contrary to his hardened expression, his tumultuous mind was transmitted through the ring.To alleviate it, she said calmly, enduring the pain.\u201cBut I could now dodge the stones so does the Duke\u2019s attacks\u2026 I think if I had a little bit left energy in me, I could dodge everything, and it\u2019s better to live with practice than without.\u201dThat way, I won\u2019t avoid the monsters that attack me, Psychke murmured. While he clicked his tongue.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t have to participate. Only I know that a princess can use sword skills. So I\u2019d rather go for tactics-\u201d\u201cNo, I hate that.\u201dPsychke flatly refused.The emperor said that she should go to the north to establish his skills, but he did not specify in which field. Therefore, she was entrusted to him. Since she has eye phobia, she won\u2019t be able to go outside the North that fast.However,\u201cEven the Duke knows that I have to step in to take out Asum with little damage.\u201dAlthough Shiona and Dalua are receiving help from the Magic Association for the herb case, they still haven\u2019t found a way to deal with Asum. And he knew it, too. So, the most efficient way to deal with Asum is to use a card called Glorielle Silkisia.But the sight of snow frightens her making her unable to move or worse, she would go mad. That was why, even if it was successful going there, facing the monsters was not an easy task.\u2018I could just fight them with eyes closed.\u2019At first, he thought Psychke was joking.\u2018Are you feeling well? I will help you with sparring.\u2019That was until he saw her running towards him with her eyes covered.\u201cIt will be fine if you keep watching.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s not okay, you have to be okay. Calm down, Duke.\u201dPsychke struck him down to the point of being cruel to him for refuting.\u201cThe Duke tends to be kind to me. If it had been someone other than me, they would have dragged the snow phobia and all to the North.\u201d\u201cIs my image that bad?\u201d\u201cWas it not?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say no.\u201d\u201cLook at that.\u201dShe snatched the blindfold from Verndia.\u201cPlease do it without kindness this time around.\u201d\u201cDo it again?\u201d\u201cI think I have a pretty good idea.\u201dCovering her eyes, she asked for a hard sparring.Seeing that her whole body was covered with scars, Verndia had no choice but to respond.Each day, she continued to train. She closed her eyes and did not remove her blindfold until she fell asleep.She sharpened her five senses and repeatedly fought the invisible enemy.On the day of the week,Shhwaa\u2014It rained, signaling autumn.* * *Pang-As she laid in the rain with her sword hanging down, in her sky-viewing position, she heard the sound of an umbrella opening next to her.She felt something warm that rested on her shoulder.Even with her eyes covered, Psychke seemed to know who he was.He said he\u2019d be late to arrive, but there he was; so early.\u201cDo you have any hobbies that don\u2019t suit you?\u201dWas it because of my mood that her voice sounds grumpy these days?She hesitated to accept the umbrella he handed to her inadvertently.His hands, which should have been dry, were wet, like someone caught in the rain.Wanting to be sure, Psychke tried to remove his blindfold but he had blocked her.\u201cBecause getting in the rain was my hobby.\u201d\u201cDo not lie.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to the Princess. Are you not going to tell me something?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you acting so hastily? Like someone being chased by something.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d\u201cDo you covet the title so much?\u201dHis voice was hoarse, asking openly.I couldn\u2019t see her because her eyes were covered, but I guessed what kind of expression it was. She couldn\u2019t see him because of her eyes but she could guess the expression he wore. She stood up to share the umbrella with him, raising it higher than his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to quickly deal with the monsters and break off our engagement?\u201d\u201cNot even that.\u201d\u201cThen? Try to understand me. If you say your eyes are scared of the snow, why on earth are you trying to come to the North while going through all this hardship?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I just not say it?\u201d\u201cYes, you can\u2019t.\u201dVerndia ran a hand roughly through his rain-soaked hair.She was all along practicing in the rain, but how did she avoid him?\u201cBecause I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cUhm.\u201d\u201cThere are many other ways to increase your power to resist Logan. The emperor said he would stop him, but you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t like it when the Princess does this.\u201d\u201cYou do not want me to go to the North?\u201d\u201cYes, I hate it.\u201dVerndia said directly. Then she hastily attached the words to Psychke\u2019s darkened face.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t like Princess. What I hate is the situation you\u2019re trying to put yourself into. If it\u2019s not really for the title, why are you doing that?\u201dPsychke strained the hand that held her umbrella. Unlike Verndia\u2019s warm hands, they were cold and hard.She hesitated, then parted her lips.\u201cI was going to do this from the beginning.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNorth, I was going to go there. This may sound like an excuse, but\u2026 The day you said you would help me find my memories\u2026 I wanted to ask a favor from you.\u201d\u201cIt was.\u201d\u201cThat was it. I was going to ask you to teach me how to fight with my eyes closed. I\u2019ll take care of the monsters, so I was going to ask you to take me to the north.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to help the Duke.\u201dHaving said this, Psychke lowered her head.She had always wanted to help, but she couldn\u2019t bring it up since she found her memories. Her heart ached at the thought that the Emperor would only offer to go north after she had made such a proposal, and that it would be easy to misunderstand.However, after a long pause, his voice was the brightest she had ever heard.\u201cAre you trying to seduce me?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHe snatched the umbrella that was getting in the way and threw it.In an instant, the light above his head lit up. She couldn\u2019t see him, but she could tell he was getting closer.And that warmth was right before her; his breath moved to her ears in the blink of an eye.\u201cWas it not, then?\u201dHis voice rings in her eardrums was extremely irritating, especially since she was blindfolded.(TN: Oh my mind\u2014)She tried to pull away, but he stopped me.He smelled water as he leaned in closer. And a heart that doesn\u2019t belong to him pounded crazily.Verndia whispered sweetly through the rain.\u201cIf it was not, then I would be very sad.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d(TN: WAIT, AACKK! STOP!

However, she couldn\u2019t say anything more.\u2018If the undying flame goes out at this time, it\u2019s probably because of you, princess.\u2019Widnix\u2019s words she heard earlier felt like tying her heart. \u00a0Yet, I feared that if I spoke my feelings to him, if I admitted that it was mutual, the occurrence of him dying might come true. She avoided his eager gaze from the side.\u201cYou know it.

She hurriedly covered his mouth, and she could feel his smile through her palms. Lazily, after removing her hand from his mouth, he licked her fingertips.It was the part where the blisters were caught and burst from holding her sword so much.Psychke felt a strange feeling but it was more dangerous since she couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201cVerndia likes the princess, does she like Verndia too?\u201d(TN: Aahhh, my heart, am literally crying. Finally, Verndia!)\u201cPlease stop\u2026\u201dAn indescribable emotion came over her, groaning as she tried to remove her hand but he didn\u2019t let go of her hand.\u201cYes or No. You have to answer with one of the two, but is that much more difficult?\u201d\u201cYes, it is difficult.\u201d\u201cHmm.

It\u2019s fun to do.\u201dHe\u2019d started speaking in the third person without thinking about it that much, but when he saw her panicking, his mischievous side kicked in and shamelessly clung onto her.\u201cSo does the princess like Verndia?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to hate you.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThen no.After a brief exclamation, he stopped teasing.Meanwhile, Psychke took off her blindfold and looked up at the man holding his chin with a serious expression and talking to himself.Sure enough, he was soaking wet.Soon, the rain had stopped.\u201cIt\u2019s filthy hard to hear a confession.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dWhat nothing does he mean?I\u2019ve heard it all, you said it was hard to hear a confession. She had heard that it was hard to hear a confession. She then studied him with narrowed eyes. As she hesitated for a moment, she took one of his hands and tugged it.She doesn\u2019t want to say it out loud, but maybe this is okay.It\u2019s not something only lovers do, so maybe it\u2019s okay.\u201c\u2026!\u201dVerndia\u2019s expression went blank at her sudden action.As he had once done, Psychke kissed him on the back of his hand as a sign of admiration and respect.In addition, she put a spoonful of her heart that she couldn\u2019t confess out loud.Her moist lips touched the back of his warm hand.After sharing each other\u2019s warmth for a while, they gently and slowly fell apart.His wavering purple eyes touched the back of his hand. There were no visible traces, but the texture remained distinct.He looked back and forth between Psychke\u2019s pink lips and the back of his hand.At first glance, she felt like she saw an incomprehensible feeling of envy passing by, but she wasn\u2019t sure.After a moment of silence, he let out a trembling voice.\u201cCan\u2019t you do this on my lips too?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d(TN: Teehee, Duke is getting more shameless! How I love it!)You fucking bastard. He glared at the back of his hand cursing it, \u2018This b*st*rd.\u2019* * *As an Evergreen who loves nature, Evergreen was decorated with green plants all over.The front and back gardens, as well as the inside of the mansion, were covered with ivy and other plants.Perhaps because of photosynthesis, the corridor was a glass wall enchanted so that it could not be seen from the outside.With so many plants, it could look like an abandoned old castle if you weren\u2019t careful, but it didn\u2019t feel like that at all.\u2018It must mean that he puts so much effort into it.\u2019\u201cThe Duke is over here.\u201dThe butler who guided her was as unique as the scenery of her mansion.He was an elderly man who could be seen anywhere, but for some reason, she felt an atmosphere of transcendence from the world.Just like his master, Widnix Evergreen.\u201cThis is the drug I was talking about.\u201dAgainst the background of the drawing-room window, where strange plants grew freely, Widnix set down a bottle of clear liquid on the table.Psychke stared down at the bottle.\u2018In the forest of Suin in the east, I said I should eat certain fruits.\u201d\u2019The high priest said that in order to quell the side effects of the beast\u2019s blessing, you should eat the fruit from the beast\u2019s land.However, because exchanges were completely cut off due to the persecution that lasted for several hundred years, there was no way to contact the beasts other than Widnix in the east.\u2018I heard that Crow and Croa doesn\u2019t like human smell.\u2019She was looking for another way because the only person she could get help from was hostile.Rather than thanking him for giving it so obediently, she felt doubtful. She dies once because of poison so she was sensitive.In other words, she needs to know whether it was a medicine made from a fruit or poison.She then directly asked,\u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d\u201cI just thought the 12-hour limit was unfavorable to the fight. Also-\u201dWidnix glanced at Psychke\u2019s hand, unwilling to hold the bottle.\u201cThis is for me, not the princess. I would like you to take it. It won\u2019t do any harm.\u201d\u201cIt seems to have other effects besides returning the body to its original state.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWidnix didn\u2019t even try to hide it.Psychke\u2019s face hardened.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt wipes out your memory from the time you received the blessing until you drink the medicine.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to drink something like that now-\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s the nature of this fruit.\u201dSomehow, one day when she told Croa about the fruit in passing, he said that he didn\u2019t want me to eat it, and that\u2019s what he meant. And now that she know of it, she couldn\u2019t drink it.\u201cIs there any other way?\u201d\u201cOther way doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dHe said it in a brutal way. She chewed her lower lip, thinking about what had happened since the blessing.\u2018The time I received the blessing was when I went to the doll kingdom to meet Stella, so all memories after that will disappear.\u2019If so.\u2018Maybe I won\u2019t forget that I am Glorielle Silkisia. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a much past memory that was covered by magic. But\u2026.\u2019Memories with Berndia, this feeling of thinking of him will fade away like foam. The memories with Verndia will fade away just like foam. She looked away from the bottle.\u201cI will not take it.\u201d\u201cAre you going to live like that forever?\u201d\u201cYes. I think that would be fine.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making me tired.\u201dLike a really tired man, Widnix leaned back against the backrest. He narrowed his brows and pressed his eyes tightly.\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy with all that nonsense.\u201d\u201cWas it because I\u2019m endangering the Duke of Verndia?\u201dWidnix removed his hand from his eye.Staring at her with his numb eyes, he let out a long breath as he dropped to the corner of her table.\u201cI\u2019m sure Princess has also heard about the unwritten rules among those people who has powers.\u201d\u201cNot to have any feelings of more than comrades.\u201d\u201cThen you know why I am doing this. Return, I have nothing to say.\u201d\u201cI heard about the Duke\u2019s authority.\u201dThe hesitant Psychke revealed.Widnix closed his eyes and threw his head back to relieve his headache, then opened his eyes. He looked a little offended.\u201cIt must be Verndia.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me why Duke Verndia is in danger. I would change the future if I knew.\u201d\u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean, do you think you\u2019re the only one who tried? I mean, who\u2019s to say that it\u2019s my turn to have all these memories-\u201dThe man who had been spitting out incessantly closed his mouth.He stayed still, straightening his posture while staring at the sky for a while.Then he asked Psychke, who was sitting absent-mindedly across from her.\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who made such an attempt. Then do you know who is responsible for all these memories?\u201dThe light green pupils widened.He looked at her with hos flustered expression, which was not like him, and then captured it as if he had always been like that.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake. Anyway, the princess has nothing good to do with Verndia. That\u2019s why I gave the medicine.\u201d\u201c\u2026 .\u201d\u201cGo north. Stay calm there and you won\u2019t die as long as you stay close to Verndia. At least you won\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cDuke, don\u2019t tell me, Duke Verndia had also changed the future?\u201dPsychke, not listening to Widnix at all, asked with a trembling voice.(TN: Hmm, such a twist chapter. *sad lioness* )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe, Psychke, Verndia, and Stella.Widnix even said, \u2018Her memories were returned because of someone.\u2019In other words, it means \u2018The past has accumulated\u2019 regardless of her authority and memory transmission which was repeating the past itself.Therefore, Psychke had returned from the past against her will.What did she see back then?\u2018Purple flame.\u2019A purple flame that was burning splendidly, embracing her body like a snake. She thought it was an illusion or was it a mistake, but it was not.That was a possibility that the scene was made by Verndia.\u201cIs Duke Verndia\u2019s power returning?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better left unanswered since it\u2019s rude to ask for someone else\u2019s power. But it appeared that he didn\u2019t tell you, so you better go.\u201dWidnix woke up and there was no emotion to be found on his expressionless face.\u201cWait a minute. I still have more questions for you.\u201dPsychke, who was hastily trying to chase after him, accidentally kicked the table. It fell down with a rattling sound, including the vial that was tossed into the air.Psychke reflexively reached out and barely caught the vial. Yet, the problem was elsewhere.Pak.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe eyes of the two met in one place. Their eyes were fixed in one place to where a purple box was on Psychke\u2019s lap which was now on the floor. It was then that her expression turned ugly.Widnix asked, blinking indifferently while looking at the box.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat.\u201dInstead of giving a clear answer, Psychke blurted out her words. She left the vial she was holding on the couch and picked up the box.She carefully opened it with a desperate heart, but as expected, the perfume was broken.A fresh summer scent rose through the cracks that spread disgustingly.\u2018This.\u2019She brought it just in case since it was also what Stella told her. She forgot to hand him the box upon arriving and now it was broken. She can\u2019t possibly give a broken perfume, could she? Psychke closed the box and pretended it wasn\u2019t for him.\u201cI should have left it in the carriage, but I forgot to leave it there.\u201dHowever, Widnix\u2019s reaction was strange.To be exact, it was immediately after seeing the perfume bottle in the box and smelling the fragrance.\u201cGet out.\u201dHe stumbled back and covered his nose with his arm with his contorted face as if he was holding back something.\u201cHurry!\u201dSurprised by the quiet man\u2019s threats, her body stiffened but he roared.\u201cGet out!\u201dHesitantly, Psychke withdrew.Even though she wondered what the hell this was all about, she turned her body to go out as she was told.When she was about to hold the knob and get out, his voice resounded.\u201c\u2026 Wait.\u201dBreathing heavily, Widnix called her.\u201cSilkysia\u2026 Right?\u201dWeird.The voice was definitely Widnix Evergreen\u2019s, but his accent was subtly different. Just like everyone else.\u201cWas it not?\u201dWhy would he ask such a question after talking for a long time with her?Psychke slowly turned back.And she was so surprised that he unconsciously hugged the perfume-soaked box.\u201cI am right.\u201dWidnix looked at me and smiled brightly.* *\u201cIt is said that memory determines who a person was. I am Widnix, but I am not Widnix.\u201dHe was unfamiliar with serving tea by hand.Psychke looked at Widnix with unfamiliar eyes.He laughed inappropriately.\u201cThe main memory that controls the body has changed. It\u2019s only for a moment.\u201d\u201cThen, who are you talking about?\u201d\u201cEvergreen.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The first Evergreen, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. All of my offspring must be evergreen.\u201dHis smile was bright yet Psychke had a hard time adapting to the fact that the blunt man kept smiling at every word he said.\u201cWhy did you change? Does it really change like that?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be. It is because of your perfume.\u201dSlowly savoring the scent of tea, he nodded toward the box of perfume.\u201cThis is how to change Evergreen\u2019s main memory. All you have to do is give that Evergreen something he loved in his lifetime. Most of the time I don\u2019t wake up, but I\u2019ve been watching you.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026.\u201dIt was hard to believe that she called the first Evergreen, but they were keeping an eye on her.When she asked why, dumbfounded, Evergreen tilted his head slightly.\u201cMy dear, do you think your lifespan is about a thousand years?\u201d\u201cPardon? No.\u201d\u201cDoes your power move to the future or the past?\u201dDidn\u2019t he just say it was rude to ask for someone\u2019s power?Even though she thought so, she had to answer since she need to ask him a question.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know my powers. Could it be that the authority of the first Silkisia was like that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dDidn\u2019t he say that Evergreen\u2019s power was remembering everything they\u2019ve been experienced?While looking at him curiously, he smiled again.\u201cSilkisia didn\u2019t tell me until the end.\u201d\u201cAhh.\u201dThe hope of knowing what the power of the first Silkisia was completely extinguished.Psychke involuntarily made a sound of pain and Evergreen was sincerely apologetic.\u201cLooks like you haven\u2019t awakened your powers yet. Then you could be the future you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen you in my lifetime.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think I saw you for real to say that it\u2019s because you resemble Shia. It was after Shia\u2019s death that my powers manifested, and the things before were very vague. It could be my misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cSh\u2026 ia, this?\u201d\u201cThe first Silkysia.\u201dIt was a memory from 7,800 years ago. Even vaguely recalling it without power was an amazing thing.While looking at him, she crossed her arms and legs. She really can\u2019t get used to him, who was always smiling.\u201cIt\u2019s fate that we met like this, do you have anything to ask me?\u201d\u201cAre you going to answer me?\u201d\u201cWhat if I can answer?\u201dSeeing him smile gently, asking to ask anything, reminded me of Verndia.Maybe this man in front of me was not the original Evergreen, but Lestir.he seem to have a similar personality to Duke Berndia.\u201cYou\u2019d better ask quickly. Widnix was slowly coming to his senses.\u201d\u201cI want to know what it means that Duke Verndia was in danger because of me.\u201d\u201cWell, that is unanswerable. It\u2019s the work of Widnix.\u201dHe said he was really sorry and put his hands together.\u201cI can only tell you what happened while I was alive.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026.\u201dEvergreen was said to have manifested his powers after the death of the first Silkisia. That said, in order to get an accurate answer, you should ask what happened after Silkisia\u2019s death. Psychke paused, asking questions that would gather as much information as possible at once.\u201cWho collected the remains of the first Silkisia?\u201d\u201cThis was an unexpected question.\u201dAs if asking about everything, Widnix languidly curved the corners of his eyes.\u201cAdel did it.\u201d\u201cAdel?\u201d\u201cAdelheid Lyne Erzebet. He must be the first emperor, right now?\u201dShe knew that the current emperor was named after the first emperor, so she asked a different one.\u201cWasn\u2019t it Lestir?\u201d\u201cYou know that the first Silkisia was an empress, right? Why did you think that?\u201d\u201cIt was strange that the imperial family isn\u2019t in the imperial family graveyard.\u201d\u201cOh, of course, they were buried there. Shia died as a side effect of black magic. The area would have turned into a land where no life could live.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe learned from other research that black magic was another name for forbidden magic.But who died from the side effects?\u201cBecause of that, Lestir and Adel had a big fight. That\u2019s how my power was manifested as well.\u201d\u201cThe first Silkisia was a worshiper\u2014so was it a sorcery?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dEvergreen responded immediately.Then he grinned at the despair on Psychke\u2019s face.\u201cWhen I was alive, black magic was one of the common magic. It was strictly forbidden because of Shia.\u201d\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even remember that.\u201dEvergreen\u2019s smile was erased.Only he would know if he was lying or saying the truth. Sighing softly, he closed his eyes.\u201cWidnix is making noise. I just have to hand over my body.\u201d\u201cI will ask you one more question.\u201dThe closed eyes slowly opened. The light green eyes that were half visible were very bored.Psychke asked what she was most curious about without holding her breath.\u201cWere Silkysia and Lestir really lovers?\u201d\u201cLover.\u201dEvergreen smiled bitterly as he pondered her question.\u201cIs it because of the unwritten rules of talented people? I was wondering if it really was because of that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWell, they got along well, but I don\u2019t think it was such a sweet relationship. If they had, I wouldn\u2019t have let Shia marry Adel.\u201dBut, while saying, Evergreen tapped his chin.\u201cIt was certain that Lestir had special feelings for Shia that\u2019s why he regretted it so much after her death.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dFor some reason, her chest ached, and she doesn\u2019t know the reason.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have built something like that at the cost of my soul.\u201dHe chinned the ring finger of Psychke\u2019s left hand.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot late, but I am happy to know that a descendant of Silkisia wears that ring.\u201dPsychke looked down at the ring.There was no Verndia nearby, but she had the illusion that the ring was shining brightly as if resonating.\u201cThen\u2026 Let\u2019s meet again in the past.\u201dShe didn\u2019t even hear Evergreen\u2019s meaningful greeting because she was occupied with her ring, staring blankly at it.Then she lifted her head, startled by the voice that suppressed his anger.\u201cVerndia wouldn\u2019t know, so it must be Stella\u2019s fault. Did she say anything other than bringing me perfume?\u201dWidnix, who had returned to normal, was expressionlessly angry.\u201cNo.\u201dUntil now, he was Evergreen, and from now on, she was called Widnix, but she seems to be the only person on the outside.Because the gap between each person\u2019s emotions was so extreme, Psychke replied at a loss.Widnix pressed his forehead and let out the breath that came from inside of him.Then he warned in the lowest voice she had ever heard.\u201cYou\u2019d better not divulge what you saw today.\u201d\u201cWhat if I do so?\u201dWidnix\u2019s eyes narrowed.Normally, I would have said yes, but since this was Widnix, who hates me, I needed to get something out of him.Before he could say anything more, Psychke cleared her confused mind and opened her mouth again.\u201cIf there was something going, there must be something coming. What will the duke do if I promise to keep my mouth shut?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You didn\u2019t want to meet me up.\u201dVerndia was overhearing the conversation between Jess and Lillian while hiding in the ceiling.If it wasn\u2019t for this, he would have followed the princess to see Widnix.Today was the day Lillian made an appointment with Jess and Lillian was really on her own.He came to prevent an unsavory incident of passing the blame onto Psychke if ever something happened to Lillian, since Jess has no capability to do so.\u201cYou kept avoiding me, but why did you ask to see me first today?\u201dJess sneered while Lillian bit her lip and glared at him without saying anything, then grabbed the hem of his dress and fired an argumentative shot at him.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhy did you meet Psychke?\u201d\u201cAh, that princess.

Money? I gave you enough of it. At that time, I gave it to you even though you failed. Title? There was nothing I can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cLillian.\u201dJess grinned, not matching his stern expression.\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense to entrust a request that can\u2019t be successful in the first place and discuss failure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe request you entrusted was \u2018to expel Princess Psychke from the capital\u2019, right?

Besides, we\u2019re an assassins\u2019 guild. We specialize in killing, not kicking out people.\u201dJess giggled.\u201cAh, come to think of it, I heard that Princess Psychke is going to the north soon, so she seemed to have fulfilled your wish.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that now?\u201dLillian shuddered at her.\u201cSaying things. Do you even know what will happen to me if she gets credit for that?\u201d\u201cDoes that have anything to do with me?\u201d\u201cJess!\u201d\u201cIt was you who abandoned us.\u201dJess laughed languidly.The inhuman aspect was completed as the brutal impression was combined with the cruel knife marks.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to leave us and go to Silkisia?\u201d\u201cYou decided not to talk about that! I just, thanks to Duke Evergreen\u2019s help-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still okay to blame others.\u201dA cornered Lillian pursed her lips.At this, Jess\u2019 eyes were savagely torn.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you be honest when no one was watching. You said you did it because she coveted your position as princess. That you couldn\u2019t see your friends\u2014\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cIf words and actions are different, what should I believe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLillian was loss for words, biting her fingernails.She still remembered the day she went to the temple with the Duke of Evergreen and how her blood reacted to Logan\u2019s blood and hair. She was actually happy.She thought that if she became a princess, she would be able to get her friends from the West out of the Black Moon.However, when she became a princess, the gap between the princess, who was like the stars in the sky, and the assassin, who was at the bottom of her life, was too great.\u2018How can I say that these guys are my friends?\u2019She was ashamed.It was even more so when he saw Hilvia clicking her tongue in front of wealthy commoners.So\u2026\u201cAnyway. I didn\u2019t call you to ask about this.\u201dJess laughed grimly.\u201cI\u2019ve already given up betting on you. So, I\u2019m going to try betting on Princess Psychke.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShocked by the sudden remark, Lillian jumped up and hit the table.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cI thought you were na\u00efve, but you were not. So, you would survive.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cI know what you can do.\u201d\u201cI-I will help you. I\u2019ll help you, so don\u2019t say anything more!\u201d\u201cThat you are a monster?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dLillian let out an incomprehensible growl. She squeezed the center of her hollow chest like someone wearing her necklace.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not like that!\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026 no. It\u2019s nothing, I\u2019ll help you. Don\u2019t go. Aren\u2019t we friends?\u201dLillian, who was talking gibberish, desperately grabbed Jess.He frowned and brushed it off.\u201cWhat friends do you mean?\u201d\u201cPlease, Jess. Please.\u201dJess got up from his seat.Lillian hurriedly grabbed him.\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d\u201cOkay. I wanted to see this expression.\u201dLillian froze at the words like a cruel victor.Jess\u2019 slow hand stroked her flawless cheek. He stroked her silver hair, ran it through the grain, grabbed a handful of them, and brought them carefully.\u201cMam Stella said that a secret must be kept. That\u2019s why I tried to protect it even when my body became rags\u2026\u201dAs the saying goes, the hand holding the hair was full of scars.Jess kissed her hair lightly.\u201cIt is of no use.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201d\u201cSecond month of Vicente, 12th.\u201dIt was the day Marquis Esland had spoken of.Verndia on the ceiling listened.\u201cIt was the first day you came to us after becoming a princess. I was expecting it, but I was stupid.\u201dJess laughed.\u201cBecause you were a real monster; your body and mind.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not like that!\u201d\u201cYou do not have to worry. There will be nothing to do in the future.\u201d\u201cJess! Jess!\u201d\u201cTake care of yourself, princess.\u201dDespite the frail call, he never looked back. Jess just left the room.Lillian screamed his name and ran away.Silence came over the noisy footsteps. Verndia was troubled as he covered his mouth.\u201cWhat?\u201dPrincess Lillian was a monster. What were they talking about?* *\u201cAre you here?\u201dIt was when Psychke returned to Lestir Mansion after finishing her deal with Widnix.Verndia jumped out of nowhere and grabbed her by the wrist.She knew he had been there to eavesdrop on Lillian and Jess\u2019 tryst.So, Psychke looked up at her fianc\u00e9 and gave her a light hello.\u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d\u201cUgh, whatever. What occurred was short.\u201dAs he led her somewhere, Verndia frowned at her pale expression.\u201cWhat else was that Widnix talking about? You told me not to come, so tell me.\u201d\u201cHe just gave me medicine to get my body back to normal.\u201dVerndia\u2019s steps stopped.\u201cI didn\u2019t take it because I lost my memory.\u201dPsychke explained the side effects of Widnix\u2019s medicine.Verndia, who had been listening to her story with a serious face, cautiously opened her mouth.\u201cAnything else besides that?\u201d\u201cThere were more, but it\u2019s a secret, so I guess it\u2019s hard to say.\u201dHe was displeased with the word secret but did not ask more.Instead, he grunted and asked another question.\u201cWhat did you do to make the smell of perfume vibrate so much?\u201d\u201cI accidentally broke the bottle.\u201d\u201cAre you not hurt? I\u2019ll have to put a drop on it.\u201dContrary to the spiteful words, Verndia hardened her face like a person who had suffered a serious problem for her.While doing so, he checked her palm to see if there was a piece of glass stuck somewhere.Psychke gently withdrew her hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to check my hand. How was your trip?\u201d\u201cThere was nothing to worry about. But-\u201dVerndia briefly described the conversation he had overheard.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what a monster was. It was an unknown fact that the holy water turned black during her discrimination ceremony, so I don\u2019t think it was because of that.\u201dHe paused for a moment before knocking on the door of the room in front of him.\u201cMore than that, Princess. Have you forgotten anything?\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201dWhat else are you trying to say by looking at him so subtly?Psychke stepped back with wary eyes and noticed that Verndia had knocked on her room.The corners of her eyes went down sullenly as she stared at her for a long time with her eyes expecting something from her.\u201cDon\u2019t you have any of mine?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dPsychke, who finally realized what Verndia was referring to, hurriedly opened the door.\u201cIt was completed later than Duke Evergreen\u2019s. I was waiting because it needed more maturation.\u201dShe pulled out a box she had been keeping dear from deep in the drawer and handed it over.Verndia made a thrilled face as he snuggled his box into his arms.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t give it to me because you looked at me so pathetically.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t look at you in a pathetic manner\u2026.\u201dHe was embarrassed because he liked it as if he had received the whole world in a small gift.Psychke lowered her gaze and said something unsolicited.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a return for the sword later. Is there anything you would like to have? I\u2019m buying with the duke\u2019s money anyway, but I\u2019ll pay you back later.\u201dAs she was talking, she realized that she was using his property, so she felt ashamed and said she would pay it back.\u201cWhat do you mean, payback?\u201d\u201cIf the princess uses it, it\u2019s the princess\u2019s money,\u201d said Verndia with a smile.He tried the perfume Psychke had on her wrist. It smelled like bergamot.\u201cI chose it because it resembles the duke\u2019s name, but if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll change it.\u201d\u201cNo way. I like it very much.\u201dRaising the corner of his mouth seductively, he sprayed perfume behind Psychke\u2019s ear.A refreshing scent hung in the air. He was very happy that she smelled like him.* *At that time, Silkisia.\u201cDesignating Princess Psychke in the North\u2026\u201dYzhar, who came home after a long time, murmured.He had been in the Death Knights\u2019 quarters ever since it was revealed that Psychke was Glorielle Silkisia.\u201cYes, brother.\u201dLennox, who was scolded by his father for presiding over the convention, nodded timidly.He looked like he didn\u2019t know if it was a good thing to tell his brother about the results of the convention.Same with the blue moon ledger and Lillian\u2019s discriminant.It was Lennox, who had become very depressed over a short period of time.He wouldn\u2019t have said it if his older brother hadn\u2019t asked first.Yzhar spat out without hesitation.\u201cIf she receives credit, Silkisia will end that day.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

N, no!\u201dLennox waved his hand in surprise.\u201cHis Majesty said she\u2019d give her a title, but he never promised to give Silkisia! And even if she does receive credit, you have a higher right of succession older brother\u2014\u201d\u201cStupid.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you know what it takes to move the nobles?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Money?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a justification.\u201dYzhar gritted his teeth.\u201cTo make a commoner into a duke overnight, and to turn a duke into a slave overnight. To make even the emperor immobile.\u201d\u201cB, but, the previous generation Silkisia was the imperial family-\u201d\u201cDid not the Duke of Lestir plead not guilty?\u201d\u201cHe just made that claim, because there was no evidence\u2026\u201d\u201cThe mere fact that a person in that position made such a claim is justification. It becomes a force and a reason to move someone.\u201dA direct descendant who miraculously survived, a supernatural power that is one of the best in all generations of Silkisia.This alone gave Psychke an excuse to threaten the head of Silkisia.Thus, even if he dodge, he\u2019d have no choice.\u201cTh, then what should we do?\u201dLennox stammered at him. He didn\u2019t understand any word he said but at least he knew Silkisia was in a disadvantageous position as of the moment.\u201cIf you stop him from setting up the Duke\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is an order given by His Majesty himself, so the moment you disobey it is called treason.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dLennox\u2019s face went white as he realized what he had done. If he hadn\u2019t mentioned the oracle, the Duke of Evergreen wouldn\u2019t have intervened and Psychke would have only been just a Glorious Silkisian. Therefore, the meeting would have ended in that way.\u201cWhat about Lillian?\u201d\u201cShe, she has an appointment, so she went out for a while.\u201dYzhar nodded insincerely to say that he understood, and left the room. Speechless, Lennox still couldn\u2019t stand up.Yzhar went straight to Logan\u2019s office. He politely knocked and heard,\u201cDidn\u2019t I said no one shall come!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dThere was silence for a while. Yzaar patiently waited, and when Logan asked him to come in, he opened the door and went in.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe relationship between father and son has not been the same since Yzhaar became a worshiper.The father acted as if he wanted to cut his son, who had become a worshipper, out of his life, and the son became even more twisted by his estranged affection.The offended son opened his mouth.\u201cIs the previous Silkisia really innocent?\u201dAt most, the voice that came and said\u2026. Logan crumpled his face.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cWas it innocent?\u201dBang!Something black splattered on Yzhar\u2019s face. An empty ink bottle knock on the door and rolled on the floor, staining the expensive carpet black.Logan\u2019s anger, barely suppressed, exploded.Ever since the emperor said he would give Psychke a chance to win, he was consumed by endless anger and anxiety.\u201cGo away.\u201dHis murderous gaze was shot at him.Logan picked up the vase next to him, put it down with superhuman patience, and issued a congratulatory order.Yzhar didn\u2019t resist and followed his father\u2019s words and came out into the hallway.Just as he was about to move, he suddenly felt a strange sense of incongruity and hesitated. The mansion was strangely quiet because the employees were holding their breath in case they were harmed.\u2018This looks like a dead house.\u2019When Psychke was around, they were the ones who went around trying to point fingers at her. They were never been this quiet.\u2018Psychke.\u2019He walked down an empty hallway. Doing the same thing again and again.Then he stopped and looked at his reflection in the hallway window.There was no expression on his inhuman face.\u2018Everything was yours.\u2019He couldn\u2019t get over the things which he thought were all his when in fact, it was all hers, to begin with.\u2018What should I do with you?\u2019He recited and recited.The moon reflected in the window hid behind the clouds and did not move until the whole world was filled with darkness.Psychke, what should I really do with you?* *Knock knock, knock.The sound of horses\u2019 hooves was familiar, but unlike any other, it made my heart pound.Perhaps it was because they were going to a place that was considered taboo for Silkisia.The carriage was climate-controlled, so he didn\u2019t feel the cold, but the Duke had told me earlier.They had crossed the northern border.Perhaps if she pulled back the curtains at her window, the plains of pure white snow would greet her.\u201cHas the princess ever seen snow?\u201dIt was around the time Psychke was thinking about this and that while looking at the closed curtains. He asked her after noticing what she was doing.Psychke answered quietly.\u201cI only saw it as a picture.\u201d\u201cWas it okay then?\u201d\u201cYeah, it was fine.\u201dIt looks so pretty in pictures, but how pretty could it be in real life?Sometimes Psychke wished to see the snow in real life.However, each time, something like an imprinted thought told her that she shouldn\u2019t.\u2018What will happen if I see it face to face?\u2019She was curious, but she didn\u2019t want to try. To Psychke, the eye was something unknown that aroused fear.Shaking off her coexisting feelings of fear and regret, she changed the subject.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a pity that Cecile couldn\u2019t come. I need at least one person to help me when my body gets smaller.\u201dCecil was unable to come to the North due to family circumstances.The lady-in-waiting, who had been very affectionate with her, appeared before her eyes as she waved her hand, saying, \u201cCome back safely.\u201d\u201cAs soon as we arrive, I will attach a heavy-mouthed and sincere person.\u201d\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to, don\u2019t force her. The northerners don\u2019t like Silkisians, so she might be reluctant to be my lady-in-waiting.\u201dThe people of Lestir basically hated Silkisia.He was openly hostile to Logan, the head of Silkisia, and it was also because she was forced to be betrothed to Verndia a year ago.Here, he spread her knowledge even to the result of the contest, \u2018If you make a contribution in the north, you will receive a title\u2019.There were rumors going around that it might have been pre-calculated and that she had previously given her advanced monster characteristics and freezing magic formula.\u201cYou just need to show how outstanding the princess was.\u201dVerndia frowned at the rumors surrounding his fianc\u00e9e.\u201cJust showing swordsmanship will change your perception. Shall we call some people as we go and start sparring?\u201dIn the past, she was inexperienced in handling her sword skills because she concentrated on suppressing her superpowers, but now she was as good at handling her sword skills as he was.\u2018If people see her, they\u2019ll say that a sword master was born.\u2019He then made a firm resolution inwardly saying it\u2019s time for him to brag that Psychke was his fianc\u00e9e.Remembering something in an instant, he frowned and stated,\u201cBefore that, I have to show how much I care for and love the princess. Because it\u2019d create mess by then.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNothing. Princess, would you like to see Lestir\u2019s castle by any chance?\u201d\u201cI want to see it, but\u2026\u201dIn the north, Lestir\u2019s base was a white castle that symbolized the pure white winter. On the days where there was a lot of snow, it was hard to pertain which was castle and snow.Those who have seen the scene even once called it a spectacle and said they could not forget it.\u201cI heard that it is covered in snow all year round but it\u2019s hard for me to see it.\u201dIn the north, it snowed in summer or winter and the only difference was how much in every weather the snow falls.In particular, the Lestir estate was even worse.Unless you know if it was a street corner where people walked, it was a waste of manpower to clear the snow on the castle.\u201cI can melt it.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go that far just to see it.\u201dHe looked at her in shocked after refusing to see it when it\u2019s the Lestir\u2019s identity. He understood it in a different way, grumbling sullenly.\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want to see it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It hurts my eyes.\u201d\u201cThe snow plies up every day, so it\u2019s not a waste. Just take a look.\u201dHe was the one who asked if she wanted to see the castle, but she felt like she was forced to do so. Regardless, he said he\u2019d take care of me so she nodded her head in agreement.* * *\u201cWow\u2026\u201dI would have been really sad if I hadn\u2019t seen it. If she hadn\u2019t seen it, she\u2019d really be sad. The castle made her heart exclaim; it was a white castle which looked like something out of a fairy tale book.It was not a simple white marble, but wherever the sunlight hits it, it emits a rainbow light, it has a different feeling from the southern water color Silkisia castle.\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty.\u201d\u201cI will show you as much as I can in the future.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t be able to look at it by then.\u201d\u201cYou said it was pretty. Are you tired of seeing it once?\u201dHe grumbled who used supernatural powers throughout the castle in the name of showing his fianc\u00e9e the castle as a representation of Lestir\u2019s identity.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, but to conserve my strength. Because you will have to fight monsters.\u201d\u201cMy supernatural ability can\u2019t be used against monsters anyway.\u201dSince physical strength was consumed when using this ability, there was no need to use it against monsters that are strong against heat.\u201cSince there was nothing to use, I can use it to melt the snow. Shall we melt the entire territory?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bit too much.\u201dOn the other hand, the employees who came out to welcome the family head back after a few months couldn\u2019t believe their eyes and ears.They whispered in a voice so loud that the two lovers in love couldn\u2019t hear it.\u201cWasn\u2019t Silkisia hated on?\u201d\u201cThis was my first time seeing the castle without snow.\u201d\u201cLikewise, despite working here for over 10 years.\u201dEveryone knew what happened at the second prince\u2019s birthday banquet because they had been in close contact with the capital.However, it was shocking because there was a big difference between just hearing it and actually seeing it with their own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was just 20 years old and has been ordered to work as lady-in-waiting while Psychke stays here.\u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019Miya puffed her cheeks out, recalling the scene she had just witnessed in the front door.\u2018How could he be like that in just a few months?\u2019Even before going down to the capital, her Master looked at the Silkisia with the same expression of detest. However, when he returned, how did he change?\u2018There must be something the Princess did to him!\u2019It wasn\u2019t just Miya who speculated things but all the employees.\u2018The Duke is human, and it\u2019s possible to fall in love with someone!\u2019 says Paw, admitting that the Duke kas fallen in love with Psychke.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Miya replied, \u201cHe must have taken some kind of love potion somewhere!\u201d and she suspected Psychke.And Miya was the latter.\u2018Let\u2019s see. I will definitely find out!\u2019She will definitely find out why the duke has changed so strangely!With that promise, Miya pushed the door of her door as hard as she could.Bang!\u201cHello! I am the princess\u2019s lady-in-waiting! Please call me Miya!\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Hello.\u201dPsychke, who was tidying up her belongings, received a warm greeting.Verndia said that he would send her maid as soon as she left, but she didn\u2019t expect to send one right away.\u201cIs there anything I can do to help you?\u201dMiya stood in front of Psychke\u2019s package. Miya\u2019s thought was to find out why the Duke has changed strangely but for Psychke, she saw her a very friendly lady-in-waiting.So, she pointed to a small package on the table and commanded calmly.\u201cCould you sort that out? You can put it on my desk where I can see it.\u201dMiya\u2019s expression became strange when Shiki confirmed that she was in her small package.\u2018At her age, she shouldn\u2019t be playing with dolls.\u2019Still, she diligently organized small-sized items such as doll beds, tea utensils, tables, and clothes.After Miya sorted everything, Pyschke turned to her.\u201cYou worked hard. I have something more to tell you\u2026\u201dUnlike the Lestir manor in the capital, she had heard that the northern castle also housed nobles from other families.Not wanting too many people to know, Psychke decided to confide her secret of growing smaller every twelve hours to only one of her lady-in-waiting.\u2018She must be trustworthy since she is the lady-in-waiting assigned by the duke.\u2019Still, she decided to get a confirmation answer once more, just in case.She sat down at her desk and clutched the brooch artifact to her chest.\u201cCan you promise not to tell anyone?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dMiya\u2019s eyes were twinkling, thinking she\u2019d get information.She has to the information right. Maybe she was trying to trick the duke into something weird to buy his favor!However,\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dIn the situation that followed, Miya doubted her eyes.After taking off her brooch, the princess became the size of her palm.Psychke, unaware of Miya\u2019s thoughts, explained carefully on her desk.\u201cIt\u2019s like a curse that comes back every twelve hours\u2014\u201d\u201cThe doll speaks.\u201dMiya\u2019s face blanked out. She seemed strangely reminded of her face, like someone who fell in love with something cute.Psychke, who was taken aback by the reaction, exclaimed in surprise.\u201cNose, nosebleed! You have a nosebleed!\u201dMiya wiped her nose with her arm. And it was a real nosebleed.In her haste, Psychke hurriedly pulled the handkerchief she was using as a blanket from the doll\u2019s bed.\u201cPlease use this.\u201d\u201cInsane\u2026\u201dShe was very cute walking around dragging a handkerchief which was bigger than her body. That one was already enough to know why the Duke had changed to strangely. That\u2019s enough to admit that the duke has changed strangely.Grasping her heart, Miya threw her to her knees.After that day, her words that Psychke had played a trick on Verndia had disappeared.It was because of Miya, saying, \u2018The princess has a certain charm that the duke would fall for!\u2019 and she stirred up the employees in the north.* *[I was depressed when dad told me to go to the north to scout monsters, but I was so happy that the princess was coming.]One morning, not long after she came to the North while Psychke was enjoying tea time with Croa, whom she met after a long time.Croa in the form of a crow sat on the armrest of the sofa where Psychke was sitting and clacking eagerly.[But the humans keep saying that the princess is coming to steal the Duke, that she came to seduce my dad, what the hell!]Yum, yum, yum. Croa swallowed the chunk of cookie in her beak.Small crumbs of cookies fell onto the sofa.[That\u2019s why I said that Princess is not that kind of girl. But they said dad also seduced the Princess.]\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d[They couldn\u2019t understand me. I don\u2019t want the other humans to know I\u2019m Su-in, so I just said it like this. Good job, right?]\u201cYeah, good job.\u201d[Hehe].As if to be stroked, Croa held out his head. Psychke did as she wished. The warm and soft touch of the black feathers made her smile.It was then.\u201cPrincess, Princess! It\u2019s still during tea time, right? Thank god!\u201dMiya, who came running briskly, handed out beautifully arranged sweets.It seemed as if it was running from the kitchen far away, breathing heavily.\u201cIt\u2019s a snack made from fruit only in the North. Try it!\u201dPsychke stared blankly at her panting lady-in-waiting.Then I reluctantly picked up one with an awkward hand gesture, seeing the bright eyes as if shouting, \u2018Try it quickly!\u2019.\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter lightly biting into it, the savory taste spreads in her mouth with a crisp sound.It\u2019s delicious, really delicious, but\u2026\u2018This lady-in-waiting, why does she treat me so well?\u2019She wondered why she liked her to the point where it was burdensome.Didn\u2019t Croa do the same, even before she came, bad rumors were biting her tail?\u2018I heard that those rumors disappeared after the day I came.\u2019I thought they would swear out of earshot because they have a certain dignity. She thought she\u2019d spread gossip, however, whenever they met, they not only greeted her sincerely, but also gave her a look of wonder and admiration.\u2018A charm that even the duke will fall for\u2026.\u2019\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019\u2018Why?\u2019Psychke did not know what Miya had spread to the employees.So, she didn\u2019t even know why they reacted the way she did.In the meantime, a certain hypothesis came to mind, and Psychke sent Croa out and instructed Miya to come closer.Then she lowered her voice to ask.\u201cHave you ever been threatened by the duke? Like, if you don\u2019t serve me well, he\u2019d kick you out?\u201d\u201cPardon? No.\u201dThe expression on her face that she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about didn\u2019t seem real.She couldn\u2019t believe that it was just her own accord to serve her with pure will?\u201cMay I come in?\u201dSmart.The duke appeared as he promised when he said he\u2019d come if she calls for him.Psychke quickly went and opened the door.\u201cWhat were you doing? Were you thinking about me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPsychke always said no when he asked with the same question. He was flustered when she answered \u2018Yes\u2019 for the first time.In the meantime, Miya walked out of her room.As soon as Miya left, Verndia asked coyly with his anticipatory voice.\u201cMay I ask what you were thinking about me?\u201d\u201cThe employees treated me so well, I thought the duke was threatening them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s too bad that you see me as a blackmailer.\u201dVerndia, who squinted one eye at her saying it was unfair, grabbed Psychke\u2019s wrist. He sat down on the long sofa and casually laid down on her lap.She smelled a faint bergamot scent from him.\u201cI never said anything like that. Seeing the princess in person, they must have thought that she was a good person.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dPsychke, who blushed slightly, laughed.She couldn\u2019t believe how long she\u2019d known him, looking at her favorably, but she was happy anyway.Verndia, who was staring up at her like that, turned his body over and settled down comfortably.He was lying on his side, his fine black hair hanging beautifully over her dress.Psychke unconsciously reached out her hand to caress it.\u2018His complexion doesn\u2019t look good.\u2019He said he didn\u2019t have time to sleep because he returned to the north later than expected.Apparently, he didn\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep yesterday.\u201cCan you spar with me today?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHis cold hands wrapped around her wrists. His hands were usually warm but why were they so cold today? Did he go outside?\u201cI have to.\u201dHe said as if he had promised and closed his eyes. He put Psychke\u2019s hand over his eye and pressed it hard.His long, dark eyelashes were pressed against her palm and disheveled.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHe let out a long breath, like a man weary of his exhaustion.If he feels unwell, wouldn\u2019t it be better if he rests today? She hesitantly parted her lips.\u201cWe can do it later if you\u2019re tired.\u201d\u201cI am not tired.\u201d\u201cIs there anything I can do to help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be busy soon, so I\u2019m just resting for a while.\u201dVerndia, who used her hand to rub his eyelids, opened his eyes.He then looked up at her as he gazed at the ceiling.Somehow embarrassed by the gaze straight up from below, Psychke averted her eyes.Verndia saw her cross earrings dangling from her earlobes.She looked at the silvery hair that covered the earring, the slightly flushed cheeks, the pink lips, the tall nose, and the clear and lovely eyes.And she muttered languidly.\u201cAlways pretty.\u201d\u201cYou mean the earrings?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe smiled lightly and stretched out his hand.His long fingers moved from the cold metal earring to her warm lobe.Psychke\u2019s face gradually turned red as he touched her lightly as if playful.\u201cWhat do you have to say, Princess? Why doesn\u2019t she ever tell me I am good looking?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you dislike my face?\u201dPsychke withdrew her gaze from him for a moment. And he said without even breathing.\u201cYou are handsome.\u201d\u201cI know that too. Is it to the Princess liking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you not answering me?\u201dHer blue eyes swept to the clock, and it was time they agreed to duel. She steadfastly avoided the stare that she felt beneath her.\u201cShall we go out? Time\u2019s up. I\u2019ll change my clothes.\u201d\u201cThat is not an answer.\u201d\u201cStop and get up. My legs are numb.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t stand up until you answer. Does the princess like my face?\u201dPsychke glanced down at him.Judging from the atmosphere, it seemed like he really wouldn\u2019t stand up if she does not answer him.So she held back her embarrassment and whispered very quietly.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201dUnsatisfied with the small voice, Verndia sighed, saying that he would not be able to get up.\u201cMy ears are not getting better these days.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201dVerndia closed his eyes as if he was serious.Oh, he really was such a mean man.Psychke closed her eyes tightly, deciding that there was nothing she could do about it.Then she mumbled barely in a nervous voice.\u201c\u2026 Listen to me.\u201d(TN: Haha, Verndia getting what he wants.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
