A heavy rain was about to fall.Inside Wohu City, Chen Xiang, while looking up the sky, muttered to himself, \u201cI cannot delay any longer, If I don\u2019t find a good spirit herb soon I might never get the opportunity again.\u201dChen Xiang had just turned sixteen this year, and his build was more robust than others of similar age. Although he had a handsome face and youthful countenance, his eyes have a sense of maturity that was not present in others his age.Although his grandfather was the Patriarch of the Chen family, because Chen Xiang didn\u2019t have any Spiritual Veins, he had to pick herbs for himself. Not having Spiritual Veins meant he was incapable of practicing martial arts. Since he was a child, he had been diligently training his own body and secretly going out to train, he once even fought a tiger-type beast. Although he was young, due to the amount of life and death experiences Chen Xiang had endured, his mental state was far more fortified than the mental states of his peers.\u201cChen Xiang? What are you doing out here? A storm is about to blow in! Are you sure you want to be out in this weather?\u201d An old steward spoke while walking towards him. Seeing the amount of hard work Chen Xiang did every day, the old steward could not help but admire him. However, a sliver of regret could be seen in his eyes.Chen Xiang had worked very hard and practiced every day for six years. But he was stuck at the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Other Chen family members, of a similar age, had already entered into the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and some had even reached the 5th level.This was all due to the fact that he didn\u2019t have any Spiritual Veins. As such, the family didn\u2019t attach any importance to him, and he was only treated as an ordinary member of the Chen family.Although he lacked Spiritual Veins, he had never been discouraged by it and had been diligently training himself. The process of attempting to train allowed him to feel a sense of accomplishment.\u201cOld Ma, I was just going to pick some herbs.\u201d Chen Xiang laughed and ran up to the old steward, who sighed and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s useless since you do not have any Spiritual Veins, no matter how hard you practice, you still won\u2019t be able to advance!\u201dChen Xian had heard such words all throughout his life, but he still insisted that, no matter what, he would not give up.A middle-aged man walked up to the two of them. \u201cXiang Er, are you really going to go out in this weather?\u201d Chen Xiang, with a small smile on his face, said, \u201cDad, the storm is a good opportunity for me to pick herbs as no one will be there to s.n.a.t.c.h them from me.\u201dThe middle-aged man was Chen Xiang\u2019s father, Chen Tianhu, a very famous and formidable cultivator and also one of the most promising candidates to inherit the position of Patriarch of the Chen family. Though his son was somewhat crippled, he had always encouraged Chen Xiang, and, from time to time, provided him with precious pills. Unfortunately, the pills didn\u2019t have any effect on Chen Xiang.\u201cHere.\u201d Chen Tianhu smiled helplessly and threw a small box towards Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang took the box without even looking at what was inside because he knew that it contained a pill. He smiled and said, \u201cDad, thank you. Now I don\u2019t need to steal the chickens that Old Ma raised for his health.\u201dThat comment made the steward frown. He didn\u2019t know that his chickens had been targeted.Watching Chen Xiang, as he left, Chen Tianhu could only let out a sigh because although he had a very high status within the Chen Family, the elders in charge of managing the pills were very strict, as pills were precious resources for cultivation, and thus, he could only save a few of them for Chen Xiang. Sadly, their therapeutic effect actually was not that significant, because they were too few in number to affect Chen Xiang.What father doesn\u2019t hope for his son to become successful in life? As Chen Tianhu did not have any other methods, all he could do was acquire some pills for Chen Xiang, and hope for the best.\u2026\u2026\u2018Immortal Devil Cliff\u2019. This was a very desolate place, and, at the moment, a bare-chested teenager was climbing down the cliff.Under the heavy downpour, Chen Xiang was actually climbing down the cliff! This was extremely dangerous, as the \u2018Immortal Devil Cliff\u2019 was very deep and filled with a type of black Qi that gave off an aura of death, therefore many people didn\u2019t even want to approach this place.Nevertheless, Chen Xiang still came here to pick some herbs and was gradually descending into the ravine, slowly approaching the bottom. If others were to know about this, they would laugh at him for being a madman. At a place, that even birds don\u2019t s.h.i.+t, which was eternally filled with death Qi, it was hard to imagine that it was an ideal location for spirit herbs.Of course, Chen Xiang was not stupid, he knew that this \u2018Immortal Devil Cliff\u2019 had been present for many, many years and had always been full of Death Qi.According to common sense, this lifeless place shouldn\u2019t have any spirit herbs, but Chen Xiang didn\u2019t actually believe that, as he knew that when things reached to an extreme, there was bound to be some reason for that extreme to exist, and he believes this eternal death Qi is caused by a legendary spirit herb.\u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019. Although this spirit herb sounded very deadly, it was actually a very strange herb, which could even make a dead skeleton regrow its flesh. It ordinarily grew in ancient battlefields or in cemeteries where the Death Qi was abundant.Only on rainy days would the black Qi sink, all due to the rainfall, because of this, Chen Xiang was able to see down into the deep precipice. He wanted to go deeper into this place so that he could search for the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019.He doesn\u2019t want the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 for himself, but if he got this sacred herb, he could trade it for many precious pills, which would allow him to be free from his current predicament and gain formidable strength.Raindrops continuously fell on Chen Xiang, making him feel very uncomfortable while also making the rocks on the cliff-side very slippery. He became very cautious, and carefully climbed down the cliff, so as not to fall.n.o.body knew what was at the bottom of the \u2018Immortal Devil Cliff\u2019, and there had been many who have gone down, but the number of people that have climbed back up was zero. To fall down meant death!Two hours had pa.s.sed and the rain continued to fall. Chen Xiang had been exercising for many years and, just by relying on his strong body, he had descended several dozen feet into the deep precipice.Chen Xiang carefully observed his surroundings and found a good temporary shelter. Then he saw something which made his heart beat rapidly.\u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s!\u2019 Chen Xiang shouted out with excitement, gazing straight down, he saw something similar to a white sesame seed cake. He was confident that this was the legendary \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019.The whole ravine was filled with black Death Qi, and, to top it all off, the color of the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 and the cliff was the same, making this herb very difficult to spot.Though Chen Xiang was very excited, he calmed himself down and rested for a moment, before continuing his journey down.It wasn\u2019t long before Chen Xiang arrived next to that \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019. He swallowed his saliva and looked at the white \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 that was the size of a bowl. He could feel the vigorous life force emitted by the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019.Chen Xiang picked up the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 with one hand. He estimated that this \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 had been growing for more than a thousand years. Selling it on the auction would earn him an astronomical sum.Chen Xiang picked up the spirit gra.s.s, put it inside his storage pouch, and then grinned: \u201cHaha! It\u2019s time for this daddy\u2019s salted fish to stand up from failure!\u201dSo long as he is able to sell this \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019, he will be able to purchase a lot of good rank pills, then he will be able to advance by leaps and bounds!The rain was gradually easing up and Chen Xiang was very content right now so he didn\u2019t continue searching the huge cliff, and, instead, choose to climb back up. After all, his strength was very limited, and climbing up was a very hard and dangerous task.After climbing for more than half an hour, the precipice suddenly started to tremble and shake! Chen Xiang\u2019s heart was palpitating as he realized that something bad was happening. As he looked above, he saw many small stones falling from the cliff-side. As they fell into the abyss, the trembling cliff began to shake much more severely.\u201cd.a.m.n, I finally got the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 and this happens. Heaven, are you fuc*** kidding me!\u201d The cliffs sudden shaking couldn\u2019t help but make Chen Xiang curse bitterly. He wanted to remain calm, so he made himself hold onto the rugged cliff, otherwise, he would\u2019ve fallen down in shock.The tremors continued to increase in strength and Chen Xiang gradually fell into despair. He, again, looked up and saw a giant piece of rock falling towards him. At the same time, the rock he was holding began to crack.\u201cG.o.d, I just got the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s, but now you are bringing me down to h.e.l.l, are you f**king with me!\u201d Chen Xiang could not help but curse , but this time, the black Qi started to rise up, and the rock Chen Xiang was holding broke\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cAh - !\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s body fell into the abyss, filled with black Qi, and shouted, with unwillingness filling his voice\u2026.After an unknown amount of time pa.s.sed by, Chen Xiang finally opened his eyes.To his surprise, he was able to see light within the abyss, and what astonished him the most was that there was water present here. He was also able to breathe!Chen Xiang floated to the surface, and he saw that he was currently in a pool s.h.i.+ning with a white aura.What shocked Chen Xiang, even more, was that, not far from him, there were two stunning girls with long hair, sitting on the ground. And even more shocking than before was that these two celestial beauties were naked! Their two perfect and flawless jade bodies were completely visible in front of him!Those two, with their pure faces, which were like meticulously carved jade statues, being without the slightest flaw. Their twin peaks were abundant and their waists were slender and smooth. They were beautiful and breath-taking \u2026\u2026 this was Chen Xiang\u2019s first time seeing women as beautiful as them.The fragrant and stunning scene had a great impact on Chen Xiang, shocking him into stillness, his whole face flushed red and his heart and breathing seemed to have stopped! The two girls were hunkered down and looking at each other. After some time, they finally found Chen Xiang, but they totally disregarded him, and, seeing this, Chen Xiang felt humiliated, as he was totally disregarded by the two beauties.After a period of absent-mindedness, Chen Xiang was finally able to see that the creva.s.se was falling apart. There were many cracks and pits visible, broken stones were scattered on the ground and, alongside the broken stones, there were pieces of scattered white silk, which gave him the idea that a battle had been fought here. He speculated that it was these two girls that were the cause of the battle, which had led to their clothes being torn apart.Chen Xiang did not know about why these two stunning and alluring girls were fighting here, in this abyss, but he realized that these two women were quite formidable, and their strength was beyond the scope of his knowledge, being able to shake the earth and move mountains with their power.\u201cThese two are the cause of my current predicament. They shook the cliff and caused me to plunge down here, but, fortunately, I had some good luck and did not die!\u201d Chen Xiang was angry, but, at the same time, he was curious about these two mysterious girls.Chen Xiang, slowly walked towards the two women, marveling at their flawless jade bodies.The abyss next to the \u2018Immortal Devil Cliff\u2019 was called h.e.l.l, but, for Chen Xiang, this h.e.l.l was similar to paradise. There was a deep pool filled with a soothing white aura and,most importantly, beside this pool there were two stunning naked girls.Only, at this time, the two girls realized that not far from them, a pair of fiery red eyes were glancing at them, and they felt shame and anger at his leering gaze.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/World Defying Dan GodChapter 002 - Yin and Yang Divine VeinsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 002: Yin and Yang Divine VeinsThe two absolutely gorgeous girls did not move, yet he felt a monstrous killing intent coming from them. Their perfect eyes were squinting, due to anger, but, for some reason, they were not able to turn their heads.\u201cSisters, aren\u2019t\u2026.aren\u2019t you... cold? Why aren\u2019t you wearing any clothes? I\u2019m feeling cold just standing here.\u201d Chen Xiang did not know what to say, so he asked a random question.At this time, the coldly elegant girl, with an ice cold face, said, \u201cYou take one more step and I will let you experience the pain of your bones corroding. You might as well just wish for death.\u201dAlthough the girl sounded crisp and ethereal and would\u2019ve been perfect but for one thing, her voice didn\u2019t contain any emotion. The girl\u2019s looks and temperament were just like her voice. Her presence would cause anyone, who saw her, to feel cold. Her eyes were filled with a cold aura, revealing a deep hostility in them.\u201cBrat, if you dare come closer, I\u2019ll make sure you regret ever being born into this world.\u201d The other girl spoke in a low voice. Her voice was pleasing to the ear, coming from all sides and captivating one\u2019s soul. Her beauty was that of a seductress, a stunning masterpiece to all those who saw her..Having two stunning beauties standing in front of him greatly tempted Chen Xiang. Though he would never call himself a gentleman, he was not a deceitful person. At present, though the two girls were unable to move, he did not take advantage of them.Chen Xiang calmed down and then spoke politely, \u201cLadies, this\u2026..is not intentional. I was trying to harvest some herbs above the cliff, but the cliff started to shake and then I fell. I\u2019m lucky to be alive.\u201dWhile talking, Chen Xiang removed two gowns, from his pack, and walked towards the girls. He could see that the two girls weren\u2019t able to move and, in order to not let them feel any more embarra.s.sed, he decided to cover their bare bodies.Chen Xiang was now much closer to the girls and could not help but let his eyes feast on their exquisite bodies. The elegant beautiful girl could only close her eyes and endure the fiery hot gaze of Chen Xiang, as he looked at her body! She trembled while emitting a cold slaughter Qi, which chilled to the bone, making Chen Xiang tremble.Chen Xiang\u2019s whole body was covered in cold sweat, and he felt a bit of trepidation while trying to cover the cold girl\u2019s body.Ahem!This allowed the girl to become somewhat appreciative of Chen Xiang, and her complexion improved a bit. She was no longer releasing any slaughter Qi.Chen Xiang arrived at the seductive girl\u2019s side and saw that she was giving him a small smile, which made Chen Xiang\u2019s face slightly red. He took a deep breath and calmed himself down. Only then did he put the gown over her.This act made the two girls feel a bit of gratefulness in their hearts. They also felt somewhat guilty, as they had just threatened him. Moreover, they were responsible for the shaking of the cliff. If not for Chen Xiang\u2019s luck, perhaps he would have died.The two girls relaxed a little. Chen Xiang did not do anything dirty to them, and this mindset of his made the girls appreciative. They were very clear on how strong a man\u2019s temptation could be, especially with bodies like theirs.\u201cLadies, have you been here for a long time? Can you tell me how to get out? I cannot stay here for a lifetime, I have some very important business to attend to!\u201d Chen Xiang spoke with frustration.The seductive girl, with a faint smile, spoke softly and said, \u201cLittle brother, I have noticed that you don\u2019t have a spiritual vein, and, in this life, you will never be able to become a strong Cultivator! However\u2026..I can gift you an extreme Yang Divine Vein, furthermore, I can teach you some formidable divine exercises and also teach you alchemy, so that you can refine pills. All of this could help you become a formidable Cultivator, but I will only under one condition.\u201dThe seductive girl threw a coquettish wink towards Chen Xiang, which made Chen Xiang\u2019s desire increase a little, yet these words made him slightly startled. However he felt somewhat uncertain, he could see that these two girls were very strong, but since they were currently injured and could not even move, how would they be able to help others?The beautiful cold girl\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBrat, I will also grant you an extreme Yin Divine Vein and teach you how to practice devil exercises! My devil exercises are not any different than my junior sister\u2019s divine exercises!\u201d She looked into his eyes, \u201cNeither of us would lie to you. It is beneath us.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s body shook, only geniuses were born with high-grade spiritual veins. But above High-Grade Spiritual Veins were Profound Veins. After Profound Veins there were Heavenly Veins, above that there were Divine Veins. Having Divine Veins was almost like going against heaven\u2019s will.\u201cDid you injure your head somewhere from the fall? Don\u2019t make fun of me. I may not have skills, but I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d Although they were far above Chen Xiang in power, he did not believe them.\u201cIf you obtain these, becoming a formidable Cultivator will not be difficult at all! However, later on, you have to help us restore our strength.\u201d the seductive girl said, shaking Chen Xiang to the core.The cold girl spoke, \u201cWe were attacked by a personal enemy and were severely wounded. We are now unable to move and we even lost our previous strength. Moreover, formidable demon beasts lurk around here, so we have to leave quickly.\u201dTheir meridians, bones, dantian, and internal organs had been hit hard. It can be said that they were completely destroyed, and this was due to the battle with a personal nemesis, which also shook the earth and mountains. This made Chen Xiang shudder.The arrival of Chen Xiang was undoubtedly a good opportunity for them to leave this place. They knew that this place was frequently haunted by demon beasts and, as they were defenceless, they could end up as a meal, for these demon beasts, at any time.\u201cYou must believe us now, otherwise, you will never be able to climb out of here in your lifetime.\u201d the seductive girl said seriously.Chen Xiang had a difficult time accepting what the two had said. Receiving Yin and Yang Divine Veins and also getting devil and divine skills for free was a ridiculous idea. But, after considering everything, he could only choose to believe what they said.Chen Xiang, with a bitter sigh, said, \u201cI do hope that you are not playing me\u2026 This young one is named Chen Xiang, how should I address my two elder sisters?\u201dThe cold beauty said, \u201cBai Youyou.\u201d[2]The seductive girl with a charming smile said, \u201cSu Meiyao.\u201d[3]Chen Xiang smilingly said, \u201cThose names really fit you! Alright, what is our next step?\u201dSu Meiyao said, \u201cWe must first enact a blood deed, which ensures that both parties won\u2019t betray each other. We will do this because we will have to live together for a very long time. Transferring our Divine Veins to you is a very easy thing for us. Senior sister and I have dual Divine Veins. Giving you one of them will not affect us.\u201dDual Divine Veins. Moreover, they both had them! Chen Xiang\u2019s mouth was twitching. This made it all the more difficult to believe. However, at the same time, his heart was also somewhat excited, because these two formidable girls will live together with him for a very long time, and, for any man, that would be a dream come true, but they still had to rely on him to restore their strength.Bai Youyou said, \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what the other is like, and to prevent that from causing disastrous events, a blood deed is a must.\u201dSu Meiyao explained the common things about the blood deed and then explained the steps of a blood deed in detail.The blood deed was simple: first, soak a beast skin in their blood, and then draw the blood deed totem on it, thereafter, write down the contract\u2019s content on the blood deed, then have the three bleed onto the blood deed and the process would be complete. The blood deed will form a contract with the soul, this will allow one to see the contract with their soul.The blood deed filled Chen Xiang with shock, only at this time did he believe what these two said was real! His heart was also filled with excitement, because, from now on, he will live with these beauties for a very long time. Moreover, this rotted salted fish can, not only, stand up from failure, but also can overturn Tianshan.[4]After that, the two girls, with celestial appearances, and Chen Xiang formed a contract.\u201cSisters, you can\u2019t move because your bones and meridians have received quite severe wounds, right?\u201d Chen Xiang asked, as he just picked up the \u201ch.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u201d. This \u201ch.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u201d was known to re-grow flesh and bones, and it aided recovering from an injury.Bai Youyou, while nodding, said, \u201cOur enemy was very strong, but that s.l.u.t couldn\u2019t kill us directly, due to a blood deed, therefore she destroyed our powers, and then let us sit here to wait for our deaths.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s arrival had, undoubtedly, saved them. Thus, they were willing to transfer their unnecessary Divine Veins to Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang was wrought with fear, these two mysterious girls, with dual Divine Veins, were already very formidable, but their enemy was even stronger than them and had put them in their current states.\u201cI picked up this \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 on the cliff above. Will this allow you to recover from your injuries?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. Since he would soon have two Divine Veins, the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s didn\u2019t matter anymore.Su Meiyao\u2019s face filled with joy, and said, \u201cYes, of course, with this we\u2019ll be able to move.\u201dChen Xiang grinned, with a simple and honest smile on his face, as he took out one-half of the \u201ch.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u201d he divided it into two pieces and fed the two women, feeding the two beauties made Chen Xiang quite happy\u2026\u2026\u2026.Although the \u2018h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019 couldn\u2019t fully restore the injuries of the two, it would, at least, allow their bones to recover without any internal disruption, making it so that they could walk freely, but they still would not be able to recover their strength.\u201cSisters, what is your background, and who is your formidable enemy?\u201d This is also what Chen Xiang was most curious about.Bai Youyou coldly shot him a look with one eye: \u201cOn the contract, there was nothing saying we had to tell you about this, I do not have to reply to you!\u201dSu Meiyao, reorganizing her hair, softly said, \u201cThese are things you should not ask, as it will involve you too broadly. You are still young, satisfying your curiosity will only bring fatal disaster to you, which is not good for any of us. Now, let\u2019s transfer the Divine Veins.\u201dNotes:[1]:1 Li=500m[2]: Bai Youyou (\u767d\u5e7d\u5e7d) =\u5e7d\u5e7d means distant representing the cold temperament.[3]: Su Meiyao (\u82cf\u5a9a\u7476) =\u5a9a\u7476 means charming jade representing the seductive temperament[4]: Tianshan = Here Tianshan is just used as a reference, and it looks something like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From their beautiful hands, a black and a white mist surged out. The black was Bai Youyou\u2019s Extreme Yin Divine Vein while the white was Su Meiyao\u2019s Extreme Yang Divine Vein. Both had a mystical appearance.Within Chen Xiang\u2019s body appeared a white and a black stream, randomly spreading through his muscles, bones, and meridians in waves. As they circulated, his body began to slowly strengthen, wave after wave, and, at last, the white and the black Qi gathered in his dantian, forming a Tai Chi Yin Yang diagram. This was the Yin and Yang Divine Veins!As Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou saw the Extreme Yin and Yang Divine Veins successfully fuse with Chen Xiang, they could not help but get excited. They originally thought that the fusion of the Extreme Yin and Extreme Yang Divine Veins would be very difficult. For them, this was an experiment, so they didn\u2019t know what would happen, but they certainly didn\u2019t expect it to be successful.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou slowly retracted their hands and watched the white and black mist start to rise from Chen Xiang. Both of them had complex and surprised expressions on their faces. According to the knowledge of the sisters, there has never been a single person with both Yin and Yang Divine Veins existing simultaneously. At this time, they realized that this brat, so long as he cultivates diligently, will one day became a universally unrivaled master.Chen Xiang gradually opened his eyes. He had never felt this comfortable and strong in his life. \u201cSo this is a Divine Vein. Ah, it feels so good! Later I\u2019ll be able to enter the True Martial Realm!\u201d Chen Xiang was somewhat excited, and a strange and evil smile flashed over his face, looking very nasty in comparison to his previously simple and honest appearance. This made the hearts of two beauties fill with worry.In this world of Cultivators, the Mortal Martial Realm is divided into ten stages: Refining Qi, Quenching Body, Martial Body, Opening Vein, True Qi, Divine Sense, True Aura, Divine Power, True Form, and finally Completion.Above the Mortal Martial Realm is the True Martial Realm. It is the dream of many Cultivators to reach the True Martial Realm. After reaching that realm, one will be filled with overwhelming force, and their lifespan will be extended up to a thousand years.Chen Xiang was currently at the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Martial Body stage. For a long time, he had been unable to enter the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Opening Vein stage.\u201cTrue Martial Realm? That would simply bring disgrace to the Divine Vein,\u201d Bai Youyou spoke with disdain.Su Meiyao gave Chen Xiang a serious look, \u201cYou have Yin and Yang Divine Veins, your outlook must be more open! In this world, power never completely stops advancing. There are many different worlds. You are currently in the Chenwu Mainland, and this is only a small piece of land in a mortal world.\u201d\u201cYou have to remember the contract! You must help us restore our strength! This is not a simple matter!\u201dChen Xiang nodded repeatedly and said, \u201cAs long as I am alive, I will certainly fulfill the contract and restore the strength of you, two sisters.\u201dBai Youyou nodded with satisfaction, \u201cThe quickest way, to restore our strength, is to use dans, and they must be very high ranking dans! After our strength is restored, the contract will be complete. At that time, we will be able to take our revenge.\u201dChen Xiang felt a little lost, but, if the two beauties stayed by his side, it was certainly something to be happy about. Su Meiyao removed a ring from her beautiful hair and threw it towards Chen Xiang, saying, \u201cPut a drop of blood on it and it will recognize you as its owner. Using this ring is similar to using a storage pouch, so put my elder sister and I in it, then you can climb back up! You should not stay down here much longer, this place is frequently visited by demon beasts.\u201dDripping blood on it, Chen Xiang established a contract with the ring. The s.p.a.ce inside the ring was very small, yet, in Chen Xiang\u2019s knowledge, legendary storage rings should have a s.p.a.ce as vast as a sea.However, one could place living creatures in this storage equipment! This made Chen Xiang marvel. Common storage pouches were very rare and are distributed by sects in the immortal mountains. While they were rare, they certainly couldn\u2019t hold living creatures inside.According to Su Meiyao\u2019s words, he placed the two women into the storage ring. As he put it on his finger, the ring became invisible. This made Chen Xiang admire it even more.He ate the dan, given by his father, and, with plenty of stamina, he started climbing the cliff, leaving the Death Qi filled abyss beneath him. For him, this was a very arduous challenge. Climbing the cliff made Chen Xiang even more depressed because he was not able to see anything, due to the black Death Qi, which also increased the difficulty of the climb.After arduous climbing that lasted for a full day, Chen Xiang finally reached the top. Now that he had completed the climb, he realized that it really wasn\u2019t all that difficult due to the Divine Veins. As he was climbing up, he absorbed large amounts of Spirit Qi which entered his body and eliminated the fatigue, making him as energetic as a dragon and as fierce as a tiger throughout the entire climbAfter Chen Xiang got his bearings, he embarked on his way back towards Wohu city.Although he was not able to see Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao inside the ring, he was still able to sense them.\u201cSisters, when are you going to teach me those divine and devil exercises?\u201d Chen Xiang impatiently asked as he was very curious about those divine and devil exercises.\u201cYour body is too weak at the moment, thus, you will not be able to withstand the devil exercises.\u201d Bai Youyou transmitted, in an ice cold voice.Su Meiyao said, \u201cYou can practice the divine exercises anytime, but first you should return home. I also plan on teaching you alchemy.\u201dChen Xiang, in his heart, was delighted and started to run as fast as he could.In the southern part of the Southern Martial Empire, Wohu City, with a population of one million, was quite large and prosperous. It was also the place where the Southern Martial Empire\u2019s famous martial arts family, the Chen Family, lived!The Chen family had several thousand years of history, and even now, their strength was still quite formidable. With a very rich heritage, they were able to survive for several thousand years, which proved their strength.The Chen family was also very wealthy, and, inside Wohu City, they are the most powerful economic force. The Chen family villa occupies several thousand acres of land, with a countless number of courtyards and numerous gardens. It was surrounded by mountains and rivers, so, even if someone wanted to sneak in, they would get lost.Tianhu Park, anyone can guess that this mansion belongs to Chen Tianhu, as a Chen family member having a prominent position, owning a huge house is a normal thing for that person.\u201cDad, I\u2019m back!\u201d Chen Xiang returned and rushed into the library, as he knows his father is always there.Chen Tianhu laughed and said, \u201cYou smelly brat! You finally came back. Did you know that there is a little beauty here, waiting for you? Do you still remember the little girl of the Xue family? Your little wife?\u201dChen Xiang brow wrinkled, in his mind, there was an attractive little girl, with skin like jade, that he played with when he was only five or six years old.\u201cFather\u2026\u2026.you mean Xue Xianxian?\u201dChen Xiang asked, remembering the girl of the Xue family. She came and visited the Chen family when she was small. At that time she and Chen Xiang had both played for the entire day, both had a very good time and, later, their families arranged for them to be married.Chen Tianhu nodded his head, \u201cRight, that little girl is in the villa, just as you went out to look for herbs, she came, and pleaded me to allow her to see you.\u201dChen Tianhu smiled and looked out of the window as he said this, Chen Xiang followed his father gaze and saw a girl, with skin like jade, walking in the courtyard outside.The girl had long hair, a white full body robe, and was adorned with s.h.i.+ning golden ornaments. Seeing the girl\u2019s attire, which was similar to that of a fairy, Chen Xiang couldn\u2019t help but be dazed by her beauty. That girl was only fourteen or fifteen years old, yet her skin was white as snow, giving her a beautiful appearance and making people unable to move their gaze from her.When the girl saw Chen Xiang through the window, her beautiful face was filled with joy. She charmingly shouted, \u201cBrother Xiao Xiang!\u201dThe sound of her voice was gentle and lively, capable of captivating a person\u2019s soul. Chen Xiang admits that, although this girl was younger, whether it be temperament or appearance, she could stand shoulder to shoulder with the two beauties inside the ring. Let alone the fact that this girl was not yet to fully developed.Chen Xiang swallowed saliva and with a dry laugh said, \u201cThis truly is the eighteen changes of a grown woman[1]! I didn\u2019t think that this little girl will turn into a fairy.\u201dThis girl was the Xue family\u2019s beloved daughter of the heavens, Xue Xianxian.\u201cThis girl is my fianc\u00e9e?!\u201d Chen Xiang cried in his heart excitedly.If it was before, Chen Xiang would feel his heart constrict, because he didn\u2019t possess any Spiritual Veins. But now, he had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins! So long as he was given time, achieving the pinnacle level of martial arts was not just a fantasy anymore.Xue Xianxian lightly smiled, and little dimples emerged on her cheeks along with a charming blush which made Chen Xiang absent-minded again.Chen Tianhu laughed and then patted Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cYou two can catch up.\u201d Chen Xiang, while laughing, hastily ran out from the library.Coming into the courtyard, Chen Xiang, without any pleasantries, grabbed Xue Xianxian\u2019s soft beautiful hands, and then quickly led her out of the line of sight of his father, as if they were going to do some bad things in their own small time.Chen Xiang, along with the little fairy, came to his own house, making many other Chen family children envious as they went.\u201cXianxian, how long are you going to stay with the Chen family?\u201d Chen Xiang asked, while laughing, and squeezed Xue Xianxian\u2019s cute, dimpled face.Xue Xianxian, with a smile, softly said, \u201cXiao Xiang brother, my father and I came to Wohu city to talk to you, so we\u2019re not going to stay for very long.\u201dDuring childhood, Xue Xianxian got a strange disease and came to Wohu city for a cure, at that time, Xue Xianxian body was weak, and looked thin and frail, so, in the Chen and Xue familes, she was often bullied. Only Chen Xiang took good care of her and played with her.During that time, it made her really happy. He also encouraged her to be strong, so she could fight her illness, and also gave her a few precious dans.These things were engraved in Xue Xianxian heart and, even when she knew Chen Xiang didn\u2019t have any Spiritual Veins and thus no future in martial arts, she still decided to marry Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang was at somewhat of a loss. He also liked Xue Xianxian very much. When they were children, both families knew Chen Xiang did not have Spiritual Veins, so Chen Xiang also didn\u2019t have any playmates. Therefore, he and Xue Xianxian were like two peas in a pod.\u201cBrother Xiao Xiang, my family told me to dissolve the marriage, but I disagreed, so they made me go see the Yao family and meet their young genius of alchemy.\u201d Xue Xianxian saw Chen Xiang\u2019s complexion changing, and, with a chuckle, said, \u201cRest a.s.sured, I would rather die than marry that Yao family brat. Also, I have heard that he has a very nasty character.\u201dIn the whole of the South Martial Empire, Xue Xianxian was considered a genius among geniuses, with her cultivation at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and being only fourteen. On the other hand, the Yao family also had a sixteen-year-old genius, who was able to refine dans. In everyone\u2019s eyes, they were the definition of a perfect couple.Chen Xiang was very calm. He now had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins, and two unidentified, yet formidable, women as his tutors, so he now had the confidence that, in a short amount of time, he could catch up with the Yao family\u2019s young alchemist.Chen Xiang grinned, touching Xue Xianxian elegant charming cheeks, and smiled as he said, \u201cXianxian, you go to Yao family and say you already have a fianc\u00e9, and, if he still refuses to accept, then tell him to come and challenge me.\u201dSeeing Chen Xiang being so confident, made Xue Xianxian very glad. She stood on her toes and kissed Chen Xiang on his lips, then, bowing her head, said, \u201cBrother Xiao Xiang, you must become stronger, I am worried about my family, as they will not hesitate to break us apart.\u201dXue Xianxian gracefully moved through the courtyard, like a swallow, her movements agile and elegant, but also making Chen Xiang become distracted, like a fool. In his mind, the image of Xue Xianxian kissing his lips appeared.Chen Xiang licked his lips and, with a smile, said, \u201cThat little girl has grown up a lot.\u201dNotes:[2]: (\u5973\u5927\u5341\u516b\u53d8) Literally: The eighteen changes of a grown woman.

Don\u2019t you think the two of us are attractive?\u201d In Chen Xiang\u2019s mind, a charming voice resounded, this voice belonged to Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang coughed twice, and, with a dry laugh,said \u201cAs long as my wife is good-looking, ha ha... Of course, you two are certainly beautiful. Oh Yeah! Sister Meiyao, hurry up and teach me those Divine Exercises and alchemy.\u201d\u201cYou pervert, what are you trying to say?\u201d Su Meiyao spat and said.\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Chen Xiang grinned while scratching his face, a strange look flas.h.i.+ng past his eyes.In order to prevent Xue Xianxian from being disappointed, Chen Xiang intended to redouble his efforts and cultivate day and night.A faint trace of aura suddenly flashed from the invisible ring on Chen Xiang\u2019s finger, as both Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao appeared in front of him, both wearing n.o.ble and elegant purple robes. Chen Xiang guessed that these clothes were already present inside the ring.At this time, the afternoon sun was very harsh, but it seemed that the two stunning girls were enjoying that annoyingly bothersome sunlight.\u201cThe Spirit Qi around here is really poor, if you do not rely on dans, then it will be very difficult for you to enter the True Martial Realm!\u201d Su Meiyao, looking up at the hot sun, murmured.Chen Xiang was somewhat confused at how the two girls were able to enter and exit the ring at will. Additionally, they were also able to hear sounds through the ring.Chen Xiang entered the small residence with them. The inside was not very large, there was only one hall and four rooms. When compared to the huge Chen Family Estate, this was indeed considered quite small.In the small hall, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were sipping the spirit tea prepared by Chen Xiang. This was from Chen Xiang\u2019s personal collection and he was usually reluctant to drink it.\u201cThe Spirit Qi is really thin here, if you want to quickly elevate your strength, you would have to rely on dans. But before this, you must cultivate out the True Qi flames[1]. Since you have the Yin and Yang Divine Veins, this will not be difficult for you.\u201d Su Meiyao said.Chen Xiang nodded his head, and said, \u201cPlease, sister Meiyao, give me advice.\u201d\u201cCome, I will teach you the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] [4] and the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols].\u201d Su Meiyao said in a charming voice,stroking her hair. That gesture was truly fascinating and charming, and even a bit flirtatious. Due to Chen Xiang\u2019s nearly infinite potential, Su Meiyao wanted his full attention, so she would have a fierce helper later.Su Meiyao\u2019s delicate hand covered Chen Xiang\u2019s forehead and Chen Xiang\u2019s mind was filled, with many texts and runes revolving around. Each one was obscure and difficult to understand on their own, but, with Su Meiyao\u2019s help, he unconsciously mastered them.Su Meiyao said \u201cI\u2019m currently using my divine sense to transfer the steps for cultivation to you. I\u2019m not just pa.s.sing you the divine exercises but also my understanding of them, you just simply have to follow the steps.Chen Xiang was shocked, he did not think Su Meiyao would be able to use \u201cdivine sense.\u201d In order to practice divine sense, one would have to, at least, be at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. It is condensed by fusing together spiritual power and true force and can be described as a very mysterious invisible and stateless spiritual force.\u201cAnything about us must be kept confidential and no one is to know about us, including your little wife!\u201d Bai Youyou said with a serious and cold tone.Su Meiyao continued \u201cI will tell you right now that my senior sister and I have numerous enemies, who could crush you simply by pointing at your head. As such, you have to keep our secrets. Also, we will not come out from the ring unless you are in dire straights.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s heart shuddered, he did not expect that he was harboring such dangerous two individuals. He quickly nodded his head before Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao suddenly disappeared, entering the ring.[Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols]! Although it was only a small portion of the whole skill, Chen Xiang was still extremely excited, after all, he didn\u2019t know of anyone who had been given the opportunity to practice Divine Skills!In the world of martial arts, the skills were divided into the general categories of Mortal level, Spirit level, Profound level, Earth level, Heavenly level, Sacred level and finally Divine level. They are further separated into upper and lower grades, dans are similarly ranked but they also contain a middle grade as well as the lower and upper grades.Heavenly level skills were very rare, and Divine level skills were even rarer. Divine Exercises, are after all, only practiced by legendary G.o.ds who have unfathomably formidable and overwhelming strength. They were said to be able to summon lightning to strike the earth and even change things that could be considered as acting against heaven\u2019s will, such as breaking the very fabric of s.p.a.ce. The [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] was a foundation building exercise, and was specialized for training the body using Qi cultivation, it is a very profound and powerful martial art Heart Law[2].The [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] was divided into four parts, namely Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Turtle Divine Exercises, and these four Divine Exercises were auxiliary in nature and mainly helped in boosting the attack and defense of other martial skills. After practicing and understanding them, they could also be used to demonstrate formidable Martial techniques.Chen Xiang arrived at the backyard of his house. Surrounded by lush green trees and breathing in the fresh air, he was able to clearly sense all five elements of Spirit Qis that existed between heaven and earth.Common Spiritual Veins were divided according to attributes, but Chen Xiang\u2019s Yin and Yang Divine Veins represents and contains all of the world\u2019s five elements, so he was able to practice all five elements of True Qis.The [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], although it was a profound Heart Law, Su Meiyao had transferred her understanding of it, so he quickly mastered it. He operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], and the Tai Chi Yin Yang diagram in his dantian started rotating immediately. This made the Spirit Qi around him violently surge into his body.The absorption rate of Spirit Qi for any High-Grade Spiritual Vein was extremely fast, as for a Divine Vein, the speed was unimaginable! At this time, Chen Xiang sat cross-legged at the cave entrance and operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], Spirit Qi entered his body, and immediately started purifying him. The Spirit Qi transformed into a pure white stream, spreading through his body within his bones, muscles, and meridians, making his body st.u.r.dier.To become a formidable martial artist, one must purify the body, both internally and externally. Chen Xiang was now strengthening his internal body, and his internal body is generating a powerful Qi stream containing formidable force, this is known as True Qi[3].Chen Xiang unconsciously entered into a state of cultivation, with Spirit Qi madly surging into his body. If somebody saw this scene, they wouldn\u2019t believe their eyes.The Divine Skills of the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger specialized in attacking while the Vermillion Bird Divine Skill mainly specialized in fire and the Black Tortoise Divine Skill specialized in defense.Practicing True Qi up to the Large Success Stage, would create a form in the dantian, and, as Chen Xiang further practices the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols], he will be able to later create an Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise, the four divine beasts, in his dantian.This means that Chen Xiang alone must cultivate the same amount as four people. Although it would be very laborious, his grasp of power will be far above others at the same level.As he simply started operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], refining Spirit Qi into polished True Qi, a large amount of external Spirit Qi surged into his body! True Qi was flowing inside the large and small meridians of his body, making his meridians much more st.u.r.dy.Morning came and pleasant sunlight entered the backyard and warmed Chen Xiang\u2019s body. He opened his eyes, which, for a moment, seemed to glow with electricity, and a wind arose around his body, dispersing the white morning mist. His body was covered with a layer of black filth meaning that he had entered into the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!From the 4th level to the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, it was considered to be the start of a new stage. Now Chen Xiang had reached the 4th level, the Opening Vein stage! This stage had previously been unreachable for him.Chen Xiang, again, closed his eyes, attentively watching the Tai Chi Yin and Yang Diagram, within his dantian, he discovered that there were five True Qi whirlpools, each separating into four directions with a clear core! Ordinary people would only one True Qi whirlpool but he currently has five! One could not even imagine how vivid his True Qi was.With this degree of vibrant True Qi, his strength was comparable to someone in the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\u201cI\u2019ve finally entered the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, now Dad doesn\u2019t have to beg those old men for herbs!\u201d Chen Xiang was rejoicing due to his breakthrough.When he thought about Xue Xianxian, who had entered the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm at the tender age of fifteen, he immediately calmed himself down. Thinking about that Yao Family\u2019s talented young alchemist hitting on his fianc\u00e9e, Chen Xiang\u2019s heart became resolute. He had a desire to cultivate himself more strenuously, before going to the Yao Family and challenging that \u2018so called\u2019 genius alchemy master.\u201cStart cultivating the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]!\u201d Su Meiyao said. Since her divine sense was restored to a certain degree, she was able to clearly sense the things going on outside.The [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols], technically speaking, was only one Divine Exercise, but, in practice, was a comprehensive guide for Boxing, Palm techniques, kicking techniques, Qigong and many others martial arts. After mastering the Divine Exercise, the prowess displayed is dependent solely on the individual.The Azure Dragon was centered around the True Qi of wood and contained both wind and lighting attributes. As such, cultivating the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] will allow the user to cast martial skills that contain either wind or lightning force.After taking a shower, Chen Xiang had a quick meal before coming back to his backyard to cultivate the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise].The [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] were already integrated into his soul, so no matter how profound and mysterious they were, he was able to understand it.After half a day, Chen Xiang was operating the True Qi within his body according to the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]. Soon, he saw his body start to overflow with a soft azure aura. Sometimes lightning would flash within this azure aura and, from time to time, gusts of wind blew out from Chen Xiang\u2019s body.Chen Xiang had now grasped how to release the power of lighting and wind derived from Wood Attributed True Qi. However, for him, this level was insufficient, he wanted to be able to transform the Wood True Qi into a fearsome wind and lighting to be used with other martial skills from the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise].Chen Xiang made the True Qi of Wood, inside his body, flow into his meridians. Cycling through his body, again and again, the True Qi moved erratically, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. Occasionally it was similar to a large river, yet at other times, it flowed gently, like a small mountain stream.Notes:[1]: a type of fire made of True Qi used for alchemical purposes (add more if needed TL)[2]: here Heart Law(\u5fc3\u6cd5) can be interpreted as sutra[3]: Qi generated by the internal body[4]: An [Exercise] is basically a cultivation practice which strengthens youPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When looked at from afar, it looked like a star had fallen on the mountain\u2019s peak. In order to keep others from learning about his newfound strength, Chen Xiang used the excuse of gathering herbs to come to this mountain and cultivate.In order to absorb larger amounts of Spirit Qi, and to gain a better sense of the wind and lightning contained between the heavens and the earth, he came to this mountain\u2019s summit. At this place, he could see dark clouds begin to rise and feel strong winds blow. lightning occasionally sparked between the clouds. Suddenly, a thunderbolt fell directly down towards the mountain peak, as if striking to destroy it.This astonis.h.i.+ng scene was actually a byproduct of Chen Xiang cultivating the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]. The fierce howling gale and the thunderous lightning in the sky were both caused by his cultivation. The moment the lightning bolt struck his body, not only did he start refining his body through its tyrannical force, but, from time to time, he was also absorbing its energy into his body.This action of his could be described as suicidal. Everyone knows that lightning is one of the most destructive forces of nature. Even True Martial Realm Experts would not dare to face it, yet Chen Xiang was cultivating using the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] and actually wanted to use that natural lightning to a.s.sist his cultivation!This bizarre scene lasted until midnight. Chen Xiang\u2019s face, which had been distorted due to the pain, was now slowly returning to normal. His clothes were torn in multiple places, and he had numerous black scars all over his body, with smoke emitting from the crevices. Yet above all those scars, a bright azure light was s.h.i.+nning. This azure light had a strong wood attribute aura, which aided his body in recovering from the injuries incurred by the lightning.\u201cAs long as I become strong, this pain is nothing,\u201d said Chen Xiang, clenching his fist and shouting in his heart as he endured the pain from one lightning bolt striking his body after another. Letting the heavens temper his body with powerful strikes of lightning.This method truly deserves to be called a Divine Exercise. Not only does it affect the world around the user, but it also tempers the user\u2019s body with lightning strikes, making it stronger.Several days went past. During this time Chen Xiang had been repeatedly struck by lightning. Now, he had finally completed his basic body tempering!As Chen Xiang opened his eyes, two lightning bolts could be seen flas.h.i.+ng within his eyes, his eyes firm and resolute. It really was an astonis.h.i.+ng sight.\u201cIt is definitely worthy of being called a Divine Exercise! Mortal Martial Exercises aren\u2019t even worth farts in comparison to this! In just one month, it has enabled me to reach the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!\u201dAt this time, Chen Xiang inspected the five True Qi whirlpools spinning within his dantian. Comparing them to how they had been before, they had already grown much larger. Chen Xiang could now control True Qi as he desired. This was the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the True Qi realm!He was sixteen years old and has already reached the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Many would consider him a genius for this accomplishment.A crimson colored True Qi resided on one of Chen Xiang\u2019s palms, the other held an azure colored True Qi. Hand in hand, Fire and Wood True Qi were cultivated through the Azure Dragon and Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise.Chen Xiang felt as if he had shed his former skin and been reborn. Both his true Qi and his body were were now incomparable to their former states. Then again, his body had been tempered and his True Qi had been cultivated through a Divine Exercise.Chen Xiang could finally understand why Divine Exercises were considered to be priceless. Truly, by cultivating these exercises people could gain G.o.dlike strength!\u201cThe Spirit Qi around here is thin. If you want your cultivation to advance by leaps and bound, then you can only rely on dans! Now that you can release True Qi Flames, you can finally begin to learn alchemy.\u201d Su Meiyao transmitted to him.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou both longed for Chen Xiang to become strong as soon as possible. The quicker he got stronger, the sooner they could recover their strength. The sisters felt fear and helplessness at the loss of their former power.------------------------------------------------------------\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the Chen Family\u2019s great young master? The Yao Family's genius alchemist has challenged you. He wants to compete with you in both alchemy and martial arts.\u201dChen Xiang had just entered the Chen Family Gate, when an arrogant teenager walked up and started talking to him.\u201cA challenge? When did this happen?\u201d Chen Xiang was a little surprised. He had only been away for a few days.That teenager started laughing at him, his voice full of disdain. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t even heard? We all thought you were afraid and went into hiding! This all happened ten days ago, because the Yao Family\u2019s genius fancies your fianc\u00e9e. You truly do have bad luck!\u201dChen Xiang was barely enduring his impulse to beat this p.r.i.c.k up. With a discerning fake smile, he replied \u201cChen Zhenhua, do you remember that time, when we were younger, and I made you fall on your face into dogs.h.i.+t? Are you sure you still wanna talk back to me right now?\u201dThe little p.r.i.c.k was Chen Zhenhua, whose father was a commander of one of the Chen Family\u2019s Branches. There were a lot of Chen Family Branches located across the Southern Martial Empire. The commanders of said families were also very strong, and only gathered at the Chen Family Villa for important matters.Chen Zhenhua\u2019s expression twisted in anger, but he had to bear it. His voice filled with ridicule, he snapped, \u201cOf course I do! Let\u2019s see if you can defeat the Yao Family\u2019s genius. I can\u2019t wait to witness your face when you lose your stunning fianc\u00e9e.\u201dChen Zhenhua departed, laughing.Chen Xang snorted, before walking away to find his father. On his way there, he overheard that the Chen Family had encountered some sort of an issue. As such, all the branch commanders had been summoned.-----------------------------------------Tianhu Park, Inside the Library.Chen Xiang ran up to his father and asked, \u201cDad, is it true that grandfather has withdrawn from the patriarch\u2019s position?\u201dChen Tianhu, while looking dignified, nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true. Your Grandfather has gone into seclusion, wanting to join a martial arts sect. The Chen Family\u2019s branch commanders are all coming here to compete for his position.\u201dA Chen family patriarch giving up his position meant that a new patriarch had to be elected. At that time many things are bound to occur, because many battles will take place, getting injured was also inevitable.Becoming a martial arts family\u2019s patriarch, one can have high authority, alongside rich resources and, because of this, many people are desperate to get the position, even at risk of their life.Chen Xiang\u2019s father would also compete for the patriarch\u2019s position, and, this time, Chen Xiang will certainly be involved. If he does not have enough strength, it will definitely be quite dangerous for him.Chen family patriarch position had never been inherited. It relied on a compet.i.tion to elect the patriarch, after all, in this world strength was revered, and only with a show of strength would others be willing to follow you. So, for the Chen family patriarch position, others can only be convinced with strength.Chen Xiang saw that Chen Tianhu\u2019s complexion was very dignified, so he carefully asked, \u201cDad\u2026 Will this be difficult for you?\u201dChen Tianhu, with a sigh, said, \u201cIt is, indeed, going to be very difficult, as there are many who are competing with me for the patriarch position, including those two brothers with whom I have some scruples\u2026\u2026.no need to say this, but the Yao family genius also issued you a challenge, it would be best to reject him.\u201dReject? After learning about this, so called, challenge, Chen Xiang did not intend to refuse. He was now a Stage 5 Mortal Martial Realm martial artist, and also cultivated using Divine Exercises. Because he cultivates using [Tai Chi Divine Exercises], he could restrain his Qi aura, and thus,Chen Tianhu was unable to find out that his son had advanced by leaps and bounds.\u201cDad, I will not allow the Xue family and the Yao family to look down upon me! I must accept this challenge!\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s gaze was firm, his eyes were filled with the intention of war, and from his body emerged an immense amount of polished True Qi, which made Chen Tianhu\u2019s pupils contract, as surprise filled his heart. He could see that his son had advanced at an unbelievable rate.Chen Tianhu could only think that his son had come across a fortuitous event while out adventuring, but he refrained from asking. His son was strong, and that was enough for him.Chen Tianhu patted Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulders and, with a laugh, said, \u201cYour dad will support you! You must make the Yao family genius know that there is something beyond the sky!\u201dChen Xiang, with a hollow laugh, said, \u201cDad, can you support me with some money?\u201dAlthough Chen Xiang father lived a rather luxurious life, he himself was quite poor, as his father was worried that he would turn into a playboy. So his father only allowed him to live a simple life, which lead to a dignified elder\u2019s grandson looking very plain in comparison to other Chen Family members his age.Chen Tianhu was a man who prefered not to waste money, but in order to elevate his strength, and also help Chen Xiang, he has spent a lot. So he has not allowed Chen Xiang to spend money randomly.\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cI want to buy a spirit herb to plant and grow.\u201d Chen Xiang whispered, while rotating his eyes.Planting spirit herbs not only requires experience, but also meticulous care. Ordinarily those who plants herb are alchemists, generally old men with white hair. One teenager planting spirit herbs with no experience is unusual, as it also requires one to have much patience, as a good spirit herb requires many years to mature.For Chen Tianhu, it would also be his first time seeing a teenager plant spirit herbs, but, seeing the confidence in Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes, he sighed and pulled out a storage pouch.\u201cIf I come to know you are lying to me, I\u2019ll kick your a.s.s to the point that sitting on a stool will be a nightmare for you for at least a month... Are we clear?\u201d Chen Tianhu smiles as he made that terrifying comment, which made Chen Xiang tremble.\u201cHere is 3000 large spirit coins. If you don\u2019t have the confidence to double the amount, then, in the future, do not ask me for money again.\u201d Chen Tianhu took out one specially manufactured spirit note.Chen Xiang took it and, with a smile, said, \u201cRest a.s.sured, I will become Chen family\u2019s youngest alchemist!\u201dChen Tianhu was shocked. He knew that Chen Xiang did not have a spiritual vein, thus alchemy would be impossible for him, but in his heart he is also secretly happy. If what he said becomes true, then it will make Chen family even more formidable. He knows that the Chen family has not had an alchemist for many years.Chen Tianhu laughed, \u201cQuickly get out of here, don\u2019t even think about trying to trick me, or you will get a beating! I will go give the Yao family your response.\u201dChen Xiang took the 3000 large spirit coins and quickly left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/World Defying Dan GodChapter 006 - True Qi FlamePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 006 - True Qi FlameChen Xiang cultivated with the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise], which was a wood attributed exercise. Azure Dragon True Qi contained a ma.s.sive amount of elemental life force and, thus, was very helpful for growing spirit herbs. There was even a particular exercise called the [Dragon Saliva Exercise] which provided a.s.sistance in planting and growing herbs. Upon casting the [Dragon Saliva Exercise] a mystical liquid would be created from his Azure Dragon True Qi, which, when applied to spirit herbs, accelerated their growth.Practicing the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercises] could allow one to create and release a flame. This flame was essential in alchemy.The [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] was a very multifaceted exercise, and there were many fierce exercises in it, but, because Chen Xiang\u2019s strength was not high enough, he could not practice most of them.At the moment, Chen Xiang has 3000 large spirit coins, equivalent to 300,000 small spirit coins, but it is still not enough for him to buy a middle-grade Mortal Level \u2018Baptising Marrow Dan\u2019. Due to their price, ordinary martial artists cannot normally afford to buy dans, as even the cheapest of them are very expensive.[TLN: I prefer using Dan (\u4e39) instead of dan, I will use dan instead of using dan. For Eg: \u2013 I\u2019ll use \u2018Baptizing Marrow Dan\u2019 as opposed to using \u2018Baptizing Marrow Pill\u2019.]In the entirety of Wohu city, there is only one place that specializes in selling dans, and that is the Spirit Dan Hall. It was a four-story building and, although not very large, the things sold inside were rather expensive. Moreover, sixteen and a half acres behind the Spirit Dan Hall was a big manor where they grew spirit herbs.Although the Spirit Dan Hall was not a.s.sociated with any clans, it was not weak as they had many experts inside. One can even find alchemy masters inside the Spirit Dan Halls, who were highly respected for their work. After all, dans were very rare and their benefits were great, allowing martial artists to increase their strength.As Chen Xiang walked inside the Spirit Dan Hall, he smelled a herbal aroma wafting through the hall, creating a soothing sensation in all who breathed it in.There were many counters, each counter selling different kinds of dans and herbs.Before coming here, Su Meiyao told Chen Xiang to start practicing with low-rank dans, thus, he intended to refine the Mortal Level low-grade dan \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019. It was cheap and easy to sell, one dan can sell for around 700 spirit coins, and anyone below the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm can get a significant boost from consuming one.\u201cYoung master, spirit dans are sold there, this stand is specialized in selling spirit herbs!\u201d The speaker was a beautiful girl standing behind the counter.There were not many people inside the Spirit Dan Hall, so Chen Xiang was very conspicuous, but, even if she saw Chen Xiang wearing a shabby outfit, she didn\u2019t underestimate him, because she knew that hidden experts sometimes came to the Spirit Dan Hall.\u201cAh, yes. I would like to buy seedlings of the spirit herbs required for refining the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019. Do you sell them here?\u201d Chen Xiang asked as he walked over to the beautiful girl.Very few people came to buy seedlings, as few have the ability to grow them. Those who were able to grow them were generally affiliated with big forces and are responsible for handling herb gardens, furthermore, they are generally quite proficient in alchemy. They are treated as treasures by those forces and are rarely allowed to come out for a walk.That girl was slightly surprised but still spoke with a sweet smile, \u201cOf course, to refine the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 you will need four herbs. The prices are the same for all seedlings. They are quite cheap, only 100 large spirit coins for each seedling.\u201dThe herbs needed for \u2018Quenching body dan\u2019 are the \u2018Azure Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019, \u2018Blood Element Flower\u2019, \u2018Profound Bright Flower\u2019, and the \u2018Spirit Leaf Gra.s.s\u2019.Chen Xiang thought for a moment, then said, \u201cGive me five of each.\u201d400 spirit coins for one set makes it 2000 for five. Chen Tianhu only gave him 3000 large spirit coins. Now more than half his fortune is gone. It seems that even the most basic of dans were too expensive to be consumed by ordinary martial artists.The girl was surprised, as she didn\u2019t know of anyone his age in Wohu city that could practice alchemy techniques and grow herbs.\u201cI\u2019ll go fetch it for you, so please wait for a moment.\u201d The girl did not think that Chen Xiang was messing around with her because people who messed around with the Spirit Dan Hall generally ended up regretting it.\u201cWell, what do we have here?\u201c A handsome teenager, wearing a magnificent and expensive white robe and holding a fan, was coming down the stairs and looking at Chen Xiang with disdain.The upper floors of the Spirit Dan Hall sold higher ranked dans, and people that can go up are all distinguished guests.\u201cAre your eyes behind your back? Shut your f.u.c.king mouth! Why is it that every time you open your mouth, bulls.h.i.+t comes out.\u201d Chen Xiang, curling his lips, replied.That teenager is Chen Zhenhua and he and Chen Xiang are of similar age. He is also extremely intelligent. At a young age, he managed to enter the 4th level of the Mortal martial realm and is now just a step away from 5th level.Chen Zhenhua\u2019s face turned green, \u201dChen Xiang, I admit that you were very formidable when we were younger, but you do not have a spiritual vein, so now I could beat you with a hand tied behind my back!\u201dChen Xiang, being at the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, could only laugh at these words. No matter how strong someone at the 4th level is, they were definitely not his match.\u201cThis is Chen Xiang? The current Chen Family Patriarch\u2019s grandson? I heard that he doesn\u2019t have a spiritual vein and is forever stuck at the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm, it seems he is here for some dans!\u201d A beautiful girl walked out from behind Chen Zhenhua and gave Chen Xiang a disdainful look.Chen Xiang recognized this girl, she was the daughter of the governor of Wohu City.\u201cIt seems that birds of the same feather really do flock together! I did not expect the governor\u2019s daughter to be so superficial, being willing to be seen with such a fellow.\u201d Chen Xiang said, then no longer paid them any attention, though he suffered and was humiliated by them, now he was much stronger than them, had worked diligently to obtain strength. Therefore, his mind was much more mature than the two in front of him.Seeing that Chen Xiang was no longer paying any attention to them, Chen Zhenhua the girl became angry. Chen Zhenhua wanted to show-off in front of the governor\u2019s daughter, so he walked towards Chen Xiang.\u201cYoung master, here are you spirit herbs seedlings you requested.\u201d The girl returned with his order, pulling seedlings out from a storage pouch.Chen Zhenhua was surprised that Chen Xiang was here to buy seedlings! This was a surprise for Chen Zhenhua, but he laughed scornfully and said, \u201cChen Xiang, you do not even have a spiritual vein, are you really thinking of planting spirit herbs. Don\u2019t tell me you want to become an alchemy master? This is hilarious!\u201dBecause there were not many people in the Spirit Dan Hall, it\u2019s usually very quiet inside, thus, when everyone heard someone loudly speak about someone not having a spiritual vein and wanting to become an alchemy master, they could not help but stop and stare.Chen Xiang was well known in the city, after all, his grandfather was the Chen family Patriarch, his father was a well-known figure, and he did not have a spiritual vein. Most people, when talking about the Chen family Patriarch and Chen Tianhu, always ended up sighing.Chen Xiang silently paid the money and received the spirit herb seedlings. He chose to ignore everyone gazes. Just as he was about to leave, Chen Zhenhua, with a sneer, said, \u201cA waste of a person, wasting so many spirit herbs.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s brow wrinkled. When Chen Zhenhua said he did not have a spiritual vein, he chose to ignore it. He had been ridiculed before, but he could not tolerate being called a waste.When everyone saw the Chen family children fighting, they were happy inside their hearts, because they knew it would be an interesting show to watch!Chen Xiang turned around a looked at the arrogant Chen Zhenhua. Suddenly a palm-shaped flame surged out from his palm, making many people begin to feel like they were in a sauna.Inside the Spirit Dan Hall, there are many people who had excellent insight, so they were well aware that this flame was not a normal flame, but actually an alchemical flame!\u201cChen Zhenhua, I dare you to try to face this True Qi flame, made by a \u2018waste\u2019.\u201d Chen Xiang spoke with a dark and emotionless tone.Only those with special talent and rare cultivation exercises can create True Qi flames. They have to be born with this type of talent and were able to understand the minute changes inside the True Qi flames.Because Chen Zhenhua was very close to Chen Xiang, his whole body was covered in sweat. The beautiful girl behind the counter was also in the same state, making her thin clothes become soaked with fragrant perspiration, making her seductive curves stand out.This fierce flame made everyone in the Spirit Dan Hall stand still, dumb as wooden chickens.[TLN: \u201cDumb as a wooden rooster\u201d it comes from a Chinese story, for the story you can visit here, basically petrified]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t burn down my Spirit Dan Hall!\u201d An old man started shouting, it seemed that he appeared out of thin air.The flame in Chen Xiang\u2019s hands started to dissipate. The people in the Spirit Dan Hall slowly recovered from their shock. They could all feel the fury that had been contained within Chen Xiang\u2019s flame.\u201cChen Zhenhua, don\u2019t tell me you afraid of the flames made by a \u2018waste\u2019? Then what does it make you? An even bigger waste?\u201d Chen Xiang spoke, openly sneering.Chen Zhenhua\u2019s complexion became extremely ugly. No one in their right mind would try to take on those flames. The mouth of the governor\u2019s daughter was wide open in shock. She looked at Chen Xiang in surprise. She could feel the power behind those flames. She lowered her head because she had been treating him like dog-s.h.i.+t on the side of the road. Who knows why Chen Xiang decided to hide his strength instead of showing it off, like anyone else that was his age would do.\u201cHall Master\u2026\u2026..This brat.\u201d One middle-aged fellow, wearing a short white robe, came out from behind Chen Xiang.That old man just kept on staring at Chen Xiang, his face contorted in a look of disbelief, shock, and joy, all at the same time.This old man was the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master. He is a very famous alchemist and had a history of scruples with Chen Xiang\u2019s grandfather.\u201cLittle brother, do you want to become my apprentice?\u201d the old man asked, which made all the people within Spirit Dan Hall gasp.The hall master was even willing to take him as an apprentice!Everybody knew that many aristocratic families had wanted their children to be taken on as his apprentice. But even if their parents personally came to ask the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master, they would be rejected without even a second look.Everyone froze in place. Chen Xiang\u2019s potential shocked every single one of them. Having no spiritual vein, but still being able to release a True Qi flame and, not to mention the fact that, the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master had seen that Chen Xiang is a good seed.Chen Xiang scratched his head and spoke dismissively: \u201cAlthough I would like to, you and my grandfather are enemies, so I cannot take you as my teacher!\u201dThen, Chen Xiang turned away casually, without the slightest expression of regret or sorrow. No one could believe that Chen Xiang had actually refused! They suspected that he might have misunderstood what the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master said. Only after hearing the sound of the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master sighing did they believe that there are some people who would actually refuse to become a Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master\u2019s apprentice.Everyone agreed that Chen Xiang was a fool. Because of a private grudge between his grandfather and the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master, he gave up such a good opportunity.Chen Zhenhua\u2019s heart was filled with jealousy. A moment ago,he had ruthlessly humiliated Chen Xiang, and everyone\u2019s gaze had been fixated on Chen Xiang, their gazes filled with disdain. But now many people looked at him with contemptuous expressions. In the eyes of these people, a genius alchemist was much more formidable than any other type of genius.He was able to refine dans. Furthermore, even though he was lacking a spiritual vein, he was able to become a fierce martial artist!Of course, not only did Chen Xiang have Divine Veins, he could also become an alchemist! He could now plant herbs and release True Qi flames. These were the two conditions he needed to start refining dans. Although alchemy needed certain experience and higher understanding, he is sure that he will able to successfully refine those dans.Chen Xiang already knew that Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Master was his grandfather\u2019s rival, moreover, his grandfather had been very good to him. From time to time, his grandfather would give him some dans, which ultimately allowed him to reach the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm.After returning to the Chen family resident, Chen Xiang found his father and told him about what had happened at the Spirit Dan Hall.\u201cWell done! That old man of the Spirit Dan Hall treats our Chen Family poorly. He sells those dans to us at exorbitant prices. Since you have a True Qi flame, it will not be difficult for you to become an alchemist! From now on, I\u2019ll fully support you.\u201d Chen Tianhu, in his heart, was very excited. Now that his son can release True Qi flames, it can be said he will have a promising future, even better than martial artists with high-grade spiritual veins.Chen Xiang retired to his own small courtyard and started planting those spirit herbs seedlings. In the evening, he sat cross-legged on his bed, sensing the rich Spirit Qi of heaven and earth. He started then using the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] along with the [Dragon Saliva Exercise], and quickly absorbed the Spirit Qi.After using the [Dragon Saliva Exercise], it will leave behind a special essence on his tongue. As long as he uses this essence to water those spirit herbs, the time it will take them to mature will significantly decrease.In the morning, Chen Xiang stretched out his tongue and found an azure colored dewdrop. This drop was \u2018Dragon Saliva\u2019!Seeing this, Chen Xiang started rejoicing, he did not expect to be successful in making the \u2018Dragon Saliva\u2019 on his first try, he quickly put that azure dewdrop into a bucket full of water. The bucket started exhibiting a light azure aura.Using the bucket of glowing water, Chen Xiang started carefully watering the seedlings.Azure Spirit Gra.s.s, Blood Element Gra.s.s, Profound Bright Flower, and Spirit Leaf Gra.s.s. These four spirit herbs were only low-grade Mortal herbs, but it normally took them 3 years to mature.However, after Chen Xiang used the \u2018Dragon Saliva\u2019 to accelerate their growth, it only took a month for them to fully mature!\u201cThe azure colored gra.s.s, which is the one exhibiting a fierce spirit Qi, is the \u2018Azure Spirit Gra.s.s\u2019. The one which is as red as blood and the size of a fist was the \u2018Blood Element Flower\u2019. The one which is white as snow and emitted a bright aura was the \u2018Profound Bright Flower\u2019. The one that looked like leaf bladed gra.s.s was the \u2018Spirit Leaf Gra.s.s\u2019.\u201dChen Tianhu looked around the small courtyard with surprise. While staring at the spirit herbs, he clearly remembered that a month ago they were nothing more than seedlings.\u201cSon, about this ability of yours\u2026\u2026\u2026refrain from showing it to others, no matter what! Only you and I will ever know about this. Just as one should not boast about his treasures in public, you should not let anyone else know about this ability of yours.\u201d Chen Tianhu spoke with a serious face and did not inquire about how his son got this ability.Chen Xiang nodded his head. This courtyard was in Chen Tianhu\u2019s domain, so n.o.body would dare to come in here without his permission and, therefore, Chen Xiang was not worried about people discovering this.\u201cAlchemy is not simple. Although you have the ability to become an alchemist. Self-teaching is a hard thing to do, especially with alchemy. You should try to build your foundation first. Even if you take a wrong step we can go and look for an alchemist when needed.\u201d Chen Tianhu said this, then removed a bucket sized alchemical furnace from his storage pouch.[TLN: Alchemy furnace looks something like this]Chen Tianhu said, \u201dAlthough this alchemical furnace is not that good, it is the best one which I can afford. Wait for me to ask the elders for some money, and we will buy a better one later.\u201dFor alchemy, an alchemical furnace was one of the most essential things, second only to the herbs. Chen Xiang was quite satisfied with the black furnace, laughing and nodding his head, he said, \u201cThank you dad. You will be the first to taste my refined dans.\u201dChen Tianhu walked out laughing.During this month, except for looking after the seedlings, Chen Xiang spent most of his time asking Su Meiyao about the main points of alchemy. That seductive girl explained all the difficulties of alchemy carefully, making sure Chen Xiang knew what he was getting into.As Chen Xiang learned about alchemy, he encountered many issues. For example, controlling the flames, pouring the True Qi continuously, and solidifying the dan, which required a very accurate control and application of spiritual power.\u201cSister Meiyao, at what time should I start the preparation to refine these dans?\u201d Chen Xiang used spirit power to exchange words with Su Meiyao, inside the ring, while picking the matured herbs. Only after some processing would they be qualified to be used for alchemy.The steps of processing required certain skills, but for Chen Xiang, those didn\u2019t actually matter, because Su Meiyao has already taught him those things.Su Meiyao with a sweet voice said, \u201dThe soonest you will be able to begin is, around, a year and a half.\u201d\u201cWhat? I only have one more month before the compet.i.tion with that Yao family genius.\u201d Chen replied, shocked.Bai Youyou spoke coldly, \u201cWhat an idiot. Why do you want to compete with him in alchemy? With your strength, you can easily slaughter him.\u201dThe corner of Chen Xiang\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. If he slaughtered the Yao family genius, then the Yao family and the Chen family will certainly go to war. Requiring his father, or even the family elders, to step in. It would be very troublesome.He starts to process the spirit herbs, and then placed them inside the furnace. After this, each and every step must be performed extremely precisely.The basic steps of alchemy include: pouring the True Qi inside the alchemical furnace, baking the spirit herbs, waiting for the spirit herbs to start emitting unique spirit Qis, controlling those various spirit Qis and mixing them with dried up spirit herbs, gathering them together in one place, and then congealing them into a dan.Chen Xiang placed both his hands on the two separate mouths of the furnace and then poured his flames inside it, while, at the same time, inspecting the internal situation of the furnace with his spiritual power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/World Defying Dan GodChapter 008 - Successful Pill RefinementPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 008 - Successful Dan RefinementThe flame was poured into the alchemical furnace, backing the spirit herbs inside and drying them out. There was some residue Spirit Qi left inside the dried spirit herbs, so his first attempt ended in failure. Nevertheless, Chen Xiang was not discouraged by this, because he had learned a few things. He learned how formidable his flames were, and that he needed to increase his control over said flames.Chen Xiang picked up the next set of herbs. This time, he made sure to pay special attention to his control, in order to manipulate the flames correctly. He carefully baked the spirit herbs inside the furnace, but it, once again, resulted in a failure.After experiencing failure three times in a row, Chen Xiang had started to build up some experience. His knowledge, regarding the control of flame, had increased during each previous attempt.On the fourth try, Chen Xiang was finally successful in extracting out all the Spirit Qi. Now he could enter the next phase of alchemy.While injecting his spiritual power into the alchemical furnace, he took a peek inside. Chen Xiang saw the various colors of different Spirit Qi being emitted by the spirit herbs. Now he started to manipulate these Spirit Qi, rotating them to form a rainbow whirlpool. The already dried spirit herbs slowly disintegrated into grey ash.After they had completely transformed, Chen Xiang manipulated the Spirit Qi emitted from these spirit herbs and combined it with the \u201cHerbal Powder\u201d...Chen Xiang was now in the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. He had a good amount of spiritual power, yet he was already nearing his limit. This was mainly because he divided the rainbow whirlpool of \u201cHerbal Spirit Qi\u201d into five mini whirlpools while trying to fuse those with five equal portions of \u201cHerbal Powder\u201d at the same time. He was trying to refine five dans at once!While forming the five whirlpools, Chen Xiang\u2019s brows started to wrinkle, and he was sweating profusely from his forehead. Not only did he need to use True Qi to form his flames, but he also had to control the formed flames while, at the same time, also trying to congeal the dans, which forced him to consume vast amounts of spiritual power.\u201cThis had better be successful!\u201d Chen Xiang shouted in his heart. The five \u201cHerbal Spirit Qi\u201d whirlpools were revolving rapidly and even began the process of fusing together. He now only needed to drop in the right amount of water and let the two successfully congeal into five dans.Chen Xiang was continuously sweating from his forehead and looked very tired. But he still continued to release the True Qi flames and spiritual power. He had used up almost all of his True Qi/\u201cI finally succeeded, plus I ended up spending all day to refine these five dans, alchemy really needs a lot of time!\u201d Chen Xiang said with a sigh.Chen Xiang opened the alchemical furnace, looking at the five snow white \u2018Quenching Body Dans\u2019 within the dissipating mist, and he could not help but grin. He had eaten a \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 before, but the quality of those dans was not even close to these.If those old alchemists came to know about him successful refining the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 in a day, they would certainly die with shame. Many alchemists took three to five years to successfully refine a dan for the first time, even the most talented alchemists would still need a year and a half and moreover, they were only able to refine one dan at a time.But Chen Xiang in his first attempt successfully refined five dans, so if those old alchemists found out then they would probably die from the shock of it.Not to mention those old alchemists, even the sisters, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, were scared by Chen Xiang\u2019s inherent talent in alchemy. They inspected the dans with their own delicate hands, and their facial expression became filled with shock.\u201cHa-ha, sister Meiyao, before you said I would have to wait for a year and a half to actually successful refine a dan, but I successful refined them in a single day, now you can give me a reward.\u201d Chen Xiang started laughing proudly.Su Meiyao was also very happy, with a charming voice asked, \u201cThen, young master Chen, how can us sisters reward you?\u201dChen Xiang, with both hands hugging his chest, smiled and said, \u201cHow about a kiss\u2026..on the cheek of course\u201d\u201cDream on brat!\u201d Bai Youyou coldly said, then returned inside the ring.Su Meiyao, while trying to contain her laughter, arrived near Chen Xiang and gave him a kiss on his cheek with her soft lips. \u201cMy dear brother, you have only succeeded through hard work, you should not be too proud.\u201dChen Xiang was only kidding and did not expect this beautiful girl to actually give him a kiss, Su Meiyao watched the stupefied Chen Xiang and laughed while covering her mouth, then returned to the ring.Chen Xiang took a deep breath while smelling the residual fragrance left by her. Calming his heartbeat down, he whispered, \u201cShe really is a dangerous woman, I, unexpectedly, got caught up in her pace and was charmed.\u201dHe touched the invisible ring on his hand as if caressing a lover\u2019s face. In order to allow the fairies inside his ring to restore their strength as soon as possible, he motivated himself.A \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 is sold for seven hundred spirit coins, and Chen Xiang refined five dans, so he can sell them for three thousand five hundred spirit coins. He earned big time and not to mention that he still has a set of herbs left to refine, so if he succeeded again, then another profit of three thousand five hundred spirit coins could be made.Chen Xiang read in a book some time ago, that you can refine up to five \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 from one set of herbs. So his target had always been to refine five dans in one go, but he did not know that refining five dans at once can only be possible in a situation when the herbs are used to their utmost efficiency. Only high-level alchemists with better understandings can solidify dans in that way, and the timing was also most important.To control spiritual power and flames at a micro level, one must take notice of the subtle changes taking place inside the alchemical furnace, or, otherwise, they will fall short.The \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 provides great help when refining the body. But they are limited to martial artists at the 3rd level, or lower, of the Mortal Martial Realm, and as Chen Xiang was now at the 5th level of Mortal Martial Realm the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 would not be of much help, but it could still help him in restoring his True Qi quickly.Chen Xiang ate one dan, and more than half of the True Qi within his body was restored. He decided to take the remaining four dans to Chen Tianhu for tasting.\u201cThe flavor is good, but I just ate seven hundred spirit coins!\u201d Chen Xiang with some sorrow went to his father\u2019s library.It was already late night, but Chen Tianhu was not sleeping. Still thinking about some things regarding the martial arts in the library, this was a habit of his.\u201cXiang Er, what problem have you encountered for you to come find me at such a late hour.\u201d Chen Tianhu smelled the fragrance of herbs coming from Chen Xiang body and immediately frowned.Chen Xiang with a grin said, \u201cI want father to taste the very first dan which I have refined!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Chen Tianhu fiercely stood up with his eyes wide open and his face filled with disbelief. He originally thought it would take Chen Xiang eight to ten years before he can successfully refine some dans, but did not expect that it just take him a day. A single f***king day!Chen Xiang gave Chen Tianhu four snow white \u2018Quenching Body Dans\u2019. Chen Tianhu\u2019s mouth stayed open with shock while looking at the four snow white dans with disbelief.\u201cStill hot!\u201d Chen Tianhu mind went blank from shock because he did not believe his son would actually comprehend alchemy in a single day. Is he a genius that was born once in a thousand years?These type of geniuses, although are respected by various forces, but they are also envied by many, and if there were people who wanted to recruit them, then there obviously will be people who will want to a.s.sa.s.sinate them.Chen Tianhu took a deep breath, calming down his heart which was filled with excitement and said, \u201cThe quality is much better when compared to the Spirit dan Hall, so it\u2019ll at least be sold for eight hundred spirit coins. I will take these four dans and help you in selling them and buying some spirit herb seedlings! \u201dFor Chen Xiang able to accelerate the growth of spirit herbs, and then refine them into dans in a matter of few days, Chen Tianhu knew that his son will become a grandmaster level alchemist in the not so distant future.\u201cYou cannot rush these things, first thoroughly refine Mortal Level low-grade dans, and when you get the hang of it, then move onto the higher level ones.\u201dChen Xiang nodded his head, and he returned to his courtyard to rest, waiting till his spiritual power is restored, then he once again started refining the last set of herbs.The next day, Chen Xiang woke up early, thinking about refining the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019. He was somewhat excited, and after successfully refining it once, this time, it was just simply following the previous steps. He arrived at the last stage of congealing the dans with ease.Within the alchemical furnace, there were five groups of herbal powder and herbal spirit Qi, fusing them together into a sludge. Chen Xiang was relaxed this time, not like the previous attempt ,where he consumed most of his True Qi and spiritual power.\u201cSuccessful!\u201d Chen Xiang sighed with relief, opening the lid of the furnace, and he saw 5 \u2018Quenching Body Dans\u2019.It only took him 2 hours to refine the dans this time around!In the following days, Chen Xiang accelerated the growth of many spirit herbs then refined them into dans. Not only was he refining \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019, but he also refined many other low-grade Mortal Level dans that have many practical uses, such as \u2018Restoring Qi Dan\u2019, \u2018Golden Healing Essence\u2019, \u2018Dispelling Poison Dan\u2019, \u2018Congealing Qi Dan\u2019 and others.Although at the beginning, each time he would have some failures, but as he got familiar with the nature of the spirit herbs and got better in controlling his flames, while also getting several tips, he naturally got better at refining dans.Su Meiyao, this mysterious girl\u2019s alchemy technique was very brilliant, and previously he didn\u2019t believe this stunning charming girl even knew alchemy, because in his knowledge, alchemist were either bald or white haired old men.Chen Xiang did not get tired these past few days and practicing alchemy didn\u2019t even affect his Qi practice. He was also practicing the [Dragon Saliva Exercise] in the evenings to create azure dewdrops, which were able to accelerate the growth of spirit herbs.Once again, a month went by, and in this month, Chen Xiang became skilled in refining low-grade Mortal Level dans.Editor Note: remember, \u2018dans\u2019 are pills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Patriarch Selection MeetingToday, Chen Xiang did not go to accelerate the growth of the spirit herbs. Early in the morning, he instead went to huge field located in the middle of the Chen family villa, because today was the day to finalize the position of the new patriarch. The Chen family patriarch position had been empty for three months, causing the Chen family to be somewhat chaotic.The huge field of the Chen family villa was covered with bricks, and many important children of the whole Chen family were standing there, which roughly amounted to three hundred of the Chen family\u2019s elite juniors.Everyone from Chen family encircled the field, and a large area in the middle was left empty, where five middle-aged men stood, of which one was Chen Tianhu.Chen Xiang was also present among the crowds, watching everything with joy, and was ready to jump in anytime to help his father compete for the patriarch position.One middle-aged man with thick eyebrow, big eyes, grey hair, said while sneering, \u201cChen Tianhu, you know we have one very important condition for the Chen family patriarch position.\u201dThe middle-aged fellow\u2019s name was Chen Haohai, and he was a branch commander of the Chen family. He was also older than Chen Tianhu and was at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. This branch of the Chen family was also quite strong, so he thought he had the qualifications to become the Chen family patriarch. In seniority, Chen Xiang needed to call him uncle.Chen Tianhu\u2019s eyes, which were filled with rage, stared at Chen Haohai and he coldly said, \u201cOf course I know, relatives of the patriarch should have good potential, in order to avoid misappropriation of public resources to waste on their family members.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s mother had already pa.s.sed away, and since Chen Xiang was sensible he never asked about how she pa.s.sed away, so Chen Tianhu was the only close relative of Chen Xiang.\u201cHa-ha\u2026.but your son doesn't have any Spiritual Veins, so if you get the patriarch position, you will certainly spend lot of valuable pills on him! Everybody knows all these years you have purchased many spirit herbs and pills and used it on him. Are you not going to help your son again?\u201d Chen Haohai while laughing said, \u201cEveryone knows he is a waste who can never advance!\u201dChen Tianhu naturally knew that his son was a genius among his peers, but he just wanted to hide his strength and not expose it, otherwise it would lead to trouble.\u201cMy son can release True Qi fire! He has the potential to become alchemist, who says he is useless? The Chen family elders will probably have other opinions.\u201d Chen Tianhu said while sneering.At this time everyone started discussing. Chen Xiang refusing the offer to become Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s master\u2019s apprentice was already spread all over in Wohu city. Although Chen Xiang did not have a Spiritual Vein, but he can still release True Qi flame so he has the opportunity to become an alchemist.Chen Haohai snorted and said in a cold manner, \u201cBut he refused to become Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s master\u2019s apprentice. He doesn\u2019t even have a teacher so he will have a hard time becoming an alchemist.\u201dAt this point, Chen Xiang calm and steady voice was heard by everybody, \u201cI am now able to refine the low-grade Mortal Level \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019.\u201dHearing Chen Xiang words, everyone stared blankly, and Chen Haohai started laughing: \u201cHuang Kou Xiao Er, you\u2019re only sixteen years old and can already refine a pill? Do not think lying will provide any help to your father in competing for the position of the patriarch. Also, lying before an elder can lead to you having some severe punishments.\u201d[TLN: Huang kou xiao er is a Chinese proverb I couldn\u2019t find any similar proverb in English, it is used to ridicule someone younger of age, if you can think of something please comment.]\u201cYou think you\u2019re the Yao family genius? People of the Yao family belong to one of the pill making aristocratic families! They have vigorous heritage.\u201dChen Xiang walked from inside the crowd, and with a steady gaze and calm complexion, he put forward an alchemy furnace, looked at the sneering Chen Haohai, and said, \u201cDo you dare to bet with me? I can refine the \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 in one try. If I succeed how about you kowtow to apologize to me in front of everyone?\u201dChen Haohai started laughing again, and everyone else became stunned, they did not even think that Chen Xiang could be this presumptuous in front of an elder!Chen Haohai became angry because of Chen Xiang\u2019s att.i.tude. Not only was Chen Xiang much younger than him and he was also defying him in front of everybody.Chen Tianhu fully supported his son\u2019s actions, and at this moment he felt proud with his son\u2019s response.Chen Haohai\u2019s face was full of anger, and he heavily said, \u201cWhat did you say!\u201d In between conversation, True Qi rushed toward Chen Xiang, but it was actually dispersed by Chen Tianhu.Chen Xiang\u2019s both eyes stared at Chen Haohai, and enhancing his sound he said, \u201cI want you to bet with me if I could refine \u2018Quenching Body Dan\u2019 in one attempt, and if I am successful than you will kowtow in front of everyone and apologize to me!\u201dChen Xiang repeated it with a serious face making sure that n.o.body thought of it as a joke, moreover his expression was also full of the arrogance. Can a teenager face an elder like this, not many within the Chen family would even dare to think of doing something like this.Chen Haohai was trembling with anger, because he saw Chen Xiang ask with a serious look, and he did not dare to comply immediately, but everybody around was waiting for an answer.Chen Xiang was watching Chen Haohai intently, while continuing, \u201cYou slander me in public by declaring me as a useless waste, and now I want to prove myself, while simultaneously making you apologize to me! As a senior you\u2019re still refusing to bet with me?\u201dChen Haohai wanted to beat the c.r.a.p out of this little brat, but he actually did not dare. After all, killing a child of the Chen family was a very serious matter.An old man said, \u201cSince it is like that, Chen Haohai you bet with him, but a kowtow apology is exempted, after all, it was simply some angry words of a little brat. If he can refine a pill in a single attempt, Chen Haohai you must give appropriate compensation.\u201d\u201cI agree, if my son losses, I will not fight for the patriarch position!\u201d Chen Tianhu said, then nodded his head towards Chen Xiang.Chen Tianhu\u2019s words cause an uproar!Chen Haohai while snorting said, \u201cOk I will bet, if I lose, than I will give him my one thousand year old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.\u201dOne thousand year old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s! Everyone together shouted in a low voice. How could they not be surprised, the Blood Spirit Gra.s.s grown for a thousand years was a very expensive and profound level low-grade spirit herb.\u201cChen Xiang, if you start the alchemy now about how long will you need?\u201d That old man asked, He was a Chen family elder and carried a certain prestige.According to everyone's understanding, refining a Mortal Level low-grade pill will at least take half a day, and the fastest it will take is two or three hours, but it was now being refined by a sixteen year old teenager.\u201cQuickly, we do not need to delay much time!\u201d In between conversation, Chen Xiang sat down cross-legged, and that elder and Chen Haohai came to check the alchemy furnace, to prevent Chen Xiang from cheating.\u201cInferior alchemy furnace, it seems Chen Tianhu, that you are very poor!\u201d Chen Haohai started sneering, as everyone knew that all of Chen Tianhu\u2019s money was spent on Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang finished removing the herbs from his storage pouch, reorganized and inspected them. While pouring his warm True Qi flame inside the furnace, he put all the herbs inside, and his every move was very meticulous.But that True Qi flame also made everyone slightly surprised. Although many people can release flames to attack but they could only do so through some martial skill and those flames can only be released for the purpose of attacking. In simple words they cannot control the flames as freely as Chen Xiang, and only if they practiced fire control type exercises could they do so, but these exercises were very rare and difficult to practice.Chen Xiang continuously poured the flame inside the alchemy furnace, and at this time, from within the alchemy furnace, the smell of some herbal aroma leaked out.One hour had past, and everyone saw with closed eyes that Chen Xiang\u2019s eyebrows suddenly started twitching. Onlookers knew he was in the most crucial phase, and Chen Haohai who is also watching this starts sweating. He was worried that he would have to give up a one thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s if he lost.Everyone saw smoke drifting out from inside alchemy furnace, and at this time Chen Xiang also opened his eyes and with a happy expression stood up and said, \u201cPlease inspect it.\u201d\u201cWhat? Completed in one hour?\u201d Everyone\u2019s expressions were full of questions.That elder started to inspect first! Although he does not know much about alchemy, he was fully aware of the alchemic process, and he had been carefully watching Chen Xiang, knowing that Chen Xiang followed the basic steps of alchemy. Although he was not clear about the situation inside the alchemy furnace, he was able to sense the heat in the furnace constantly changing, and these changes were very subtle.Opening the lid of furnace, everyone smelt the faint herbal aroma, and they were truly familiar with this aroma. Moreover they also witnessed the refining process, and when they saw the elder taking out five snow white pills, everyone could not help but exclaim.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He is only sixteen years old and is already able to refine the Quenching Body Pill, he is extremely talented!\u201d a man shouted with shock.\u201cIt looks like the quality of this Quenching Body Pill is much better than what we usually use. I did not think that Chen Xiang would be so secretive. He has been hiding his strength and bidding his time! Just his alchemy techniques alone make him much more valuable than those geniuses with high-grade Spiritual Veins.\u201d another man exclaimed.All of the Chen Family\u2019s core members gathered in this field now sighed with jealousy and envy.Chen Haohai was shocked, sad and angry, all at the same time. His complexion turned very ugly.The obvious reason being that he had just lost a Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s. If it were to be taken to the auction house, it would\u2019ve been sold for an extremely high price.The Chen Family\u2019s elder had trembling hands. Both of his eyes were wide open while staring at the snow white pills in his palm. \u201cMy Chen Family finally has an alchemist!\u201dThe Chen Family finally had an alchemist on their side! These simple words set the blood of every single Chen Family member aboil. One had to know that the Chen Family did not have an alchemist, so they had to spend large amounts of resources to buy pills that were made by others. This caused them to be ridiculed by some of the fierce martial pract.i.tioner\u2019s that belonged to the other aristocratic familiesBut now, the Chen Family also had an alchemist. Not to mention, this boy was so young! Sooner or later he was bound to become a Grandmaster level alchemist!\u201cChen Haohai, you bet with my son willingly, now you should admit and accept your defeat!\u201d Chen Tianhu said with a laugh.\u201cHumph!\u201d Chen Haohai was jealous but also very sad. He reluctantly took out the Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s and handed it over to Chen Xiang.Now n.o.body in the entire Chen Family would even dare to look down on Chen Xiang. After all, he was now a sixteen year old alchemist! Many of the girls from the branch families even started to throw coquettish looks towards Chen Xiang in an attempt to reel him in.Many of the young boys from the Chen Family glared at Chen Xiang with fire in their eyes, they were jealous to the point of death!Chen Xiang completely turned a blind eye towards their reactions, as he remembered many of these people ridiculing him before.\u201cEven if your son is an alchemist, you still have to fight for the Patriarch position!\u201d Chen Haohai retorted.Two other middle aged men that were previously competing with Chen Tianhu for the Patriarch position announced their withdrawal. They were able to tell that Chen Xiang was only sixteen years old, yet he was already able to refine a Mortal Level Low Grade Dan. It could be said that his future was immeasurable and potentially boundless. Not offending such a person would be the most sensible approach.Other than Chen Haohai and Chen Tianhu, there was just one other person remaining in the compet.i.tion for the t.i.tle of Patriarch.Chen Haohai said, \u201cChen Tianhu, now you just have to fight against us two brothers. If you win, then naturally the position of Patriarch will be yours!\u201dChen Tianhu while squinting his eyes said, \u201cThis is what you are saying?\u201d\u201cWell then, will the two of you come together or one by one?\u201dEven though Chen Tianhu was outnumbered, his speech did not show any signs of weakness but instead displayed his strong character. Chen Tianhu was indeed someone capable of making others submit before him.\u201cOf course it will be one on one. We brothers would not want anyone to think we are bullies, now would we?\u201d Hearing Chen Haohai, the crowd retreated a few steps back, giving the three of them more s.p.a.ce.The shockwaves emitted by a battle between two pract.i.tioners at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm alone were extremely frightening.Everyone retreated away from the edges of the field, both Chen Tianhu and Chen Haohai simultaneously moved using their fastest speeds, both of their palms striking the other. Their palms closely stuck to each other, while they started contesting using their True Qi.Chen Haohai\u2019s whole body was covered with scorching hot True Qi, while there was no movement from Chen Tianhu. But the hideous blue veins that were filled with True Qi was appearing on Chen Tianhu.Both of them are still stuck closely together, while looking at each other with serious expressions. Suddenly the whole field started to shake and tremble, the ground beneath them began to crack, and waves of air currents were violently blowing sand and dust in all four directions.Chen Tianhu violently roared, and with it the shaking disappeared and the fierce air current also stopped. Chen Haohai was blown backwards while coughing up large amounts of blood, while Chen Tianhu also retreated few steps.Falling on the ground, Chen Haohai struggled to get up on his feet. He knew that he had just lost, but there was a trace of a proud smile on his face.This contest Chen Tianhu had won, but his complexion became pale.Chen Haohai while laughing said, \u201cAlthough you have won the battle, but you will lose this war. In your current state, even a 6th level Mortal Martial Realm martial pract.i.tioner can easily defeat you!\u201d While laughing, he also coughed up a lot of blood, as it could be seen that he had suffered some heavy internal injuries.\u201cYou are also in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm?!\u201d Chen Tianhu asked while covering his abdomen with one hand. He did not think that Chen Haohai would unexpectedly step into the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm.\u201cAre you not same?\u201d Chen Haohai sneered.Both Chen Haohai and Chen Tianhu were actually 8th level Mortal Martial Realm martial pract.i.tioners, and this made everyone shocked. Everyone could see that Chen Haohai did not even hesitate to severely injure Chen Tianhu.Chen Tianhu still had another fight left and his opponent was Chen Haohai\u2019s younger brother!Chen Xiang swiftly moved past, supporting Chen Tianhu who is almost about to fall: \u201cDad, how are you?\u201d While asking, Chen Xiang put his hand on Chen Tianhu\u2019s abdomen and poured a pure Wood True Qi into his father body. Sensing the vigorous Wood True Qi gus.h.i.+ng inside his body, Chen Tianhu shuddered, looked at Chen Xiang with a shocked expression, but soon calmed down.[Editor\u2019s Note: From now on We\u2019ll try to use just Wood True Qi, or Lightning True Qi instead of wooden attributed or Lightnin attributed True Qi as that\u2019s too long and they have the same meaning]\u201cI suffered some serious internal injuries, Chen Haohai did not hesitate to seriously injure me, so do not waste your True Qi!\u201d Chen Tianhu was excited in his heart, because he felt his son\u2019s True Qi was quite vigorous, and its strength was far more than what he had expected.Chen Xiang heart became very heavy after listening to Chen Tianhu. If his father lost the battle, then it would become a hopeless situation.\u201cStart the second battle, do not waste time needlessly!\u201d Chen Haohai said with a weak voice and a pale complexion, but he was very excited inside. He could already see the scene of his brother defeating Chen Tianhu.Chen Xiang while watching Chen Haohai intensely, with a sharp aura flas.h.i.+ng in his eyes, said, \u201cI\u2019ll fight.\u201dChen Xiang unexpectedly wanted to fight in place of his father, and this made everyone quite surprised. They knew Chen Xiang did not have any Spiritual Veins and therefore was not very strong. However he could still release True Qi flames and already had a profound level of control over them, but he cannot recover the True Qi in such as short amount of time.Chen Xiang wasn\u2019t also going to be facing an ordinary person, and his opponent was a pract.i.tioner with the strength at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Everyone mostly thought that in order to make his father the Patriarch, Chen Xiang made an idiotic decision.Chen Tianhu was also very surprised by Chen Xiang, but when he saw Chen Xiang\u2019s gaze full of confidence, his worries disappeared. Moreover he was now seriously injured, so if he fights in his current condition then he will surely lose. Not to mention that his injuries will surely become worse.A teenager came forth with a contemptuous laugh \u201cYou do not have a Spiritual Vein and you want to enter the dispute for the Patriarch\u2019s position? By just refining some low levelled pills, you think you have enough strength, I alone can easily put you down! Plus I recently entered the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!\u201dThis teenager was Chen Zhenhua, and he had some conflict with Chen Xiang in the Spirit Dan Hall and was Chen Haohai\u2019s son.Entering into the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm at this age also made him a rare genius and thus justifies his arrogance.\u201cChen Zhenhua, if I win against you, what will happen then?\u201d Chen Xiang said with a dull tone, his expression was very calm, not like a hot-headed person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Divine Exercise Strength RevealedChen Tianhu felt that Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi was unusually strong, but he also had quite a unique breath, the likes of which he had never seen before. He gave this matter some serious consideration, then said, \u201cLet my son represent me in this battle! If he were to lose, then the patriarch\u2019s position will belongs to your brother, moreover he will also return that Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s back to you.\u201dChen Tianhu\u2019s proposal meant that he believed Chen Xiang had a chance of winning, which made Chen Xiang feel no small pressure in his heart. He turned around, looked at Chen Tianhu and saw Chen Tianhu showing a trace of warmth in his smile while nodding his heart.\u201cWell then, allow me to come and settle this matter with my own two hands!\u201d Chen Zhenhua came from the crowd to the centre of the field while his face was full of contempt and his pair of eyes, which were looking at Chen Xiang, were filled with pride.At such a young age, he had already entered the 5th level of mortal martial realm, Chen Zhenhua ignored Chen Xiang\u2019s young alchemist achievement while showing an arrogant approach. Seeing this many elders of the Chen family inwardly shook their heads, because they all know one alchemist has the potential to raise many powerful martial artists.The seriously injured Chen Haohai with a sneer said: \u201cYoung men sure are filled with youthful energy, if in the process of fighting what will happen if someone were to die? Accidently killing Chen family\u2019s talented alchemist, I will be scolded to death by those old fellows.\u201dChen Tianhu did not speak, he was seriously contemplating this.Chen Haohai slightly smiling: \u201cIf you are determined to make your alchemist son go to battle, and if by-chance some mishap happened in the middle of fight, everybody can only wonder that he had half-baked skills.\u201d\u201cRest a.s.sured, if I was injured or killed, it will be my own responsibility!\u201d Chen Xiang said, he knows if his father could not become the patriarch, even though his son is an alchemist, he still will be vigorously suppressed by Chen Haohai, because in the eyes of Chen Haohai he is a big threat.\u201cEverybody clearly heard, this is what he said! Since it is this way, then let him first contest with my son, and if he wins against my son, it will be clear that he has the qualification to battle with my younger brother.\u201dChen Haohai\u2019s face was filled with a happy expression, because he concluded Chen Xiang was not that strong. Even if he was able to win against his own son, it was impossible to win against his brother, after all his brother was in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Not only would he become the Chen family Patriarch, but also be able to recapture the Thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.Chen Zhenhua after getting his father\u2019s permission, with face full of contempt said, \u201cIf you get seriously injured due to my carelessness, you cannot blame me. Who told you to bite more than you can chew.\u201dChen Xiang with an expressionless face, turned towards Chen Haohai and asked, \u201cIf I win I can fight instead of my father, right?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u2026.\u201d Chen Haohai laughed, \u201cYes, but you have to win first?\u201dThe people who were supporting Chen Haohai began to laugh.Chen Zhenhua while performing the \u2018Kung Fu courtesy of covering one\u2019s fist\u2019, with a sneer said, \u201cI will not be lenient.\u201d[ED: Kungfu courtesy of covering one\u2019s fist ]\u201cStart!\u201d shouted Chen Tianhu with an imposing look.As soon as the word left Chan Tianhu\u2019s mouth, Chen Zhenhua quickly jumped and rushed towards Chen Xiang. His movements were gentle and elegant and his hands were held high facing the sky. But just a moment later, a fierce wind surged forth and a golden aura began circulating around his hands and it instantly formed into a giant golden axe.\u201cThe Chen family\u2019s High Grade Spirit Level Martial Skill, the [Heavenly Sun Axe Strike]. It can transform one\u2019s True Qi into a weapon with a strong offensive power!\u201d A person exclaimed, and a High Grade Spirit Level Martial Skill was difficult to learn, but its power was huge.Chen Xiang stood there motionlessly, just staring at the incoming axe. When everyone was thinking that he was scared due to fierce Metal True Qi, and seeing that True Qi transform into a golden axe that was about to smash his head. Fierce Qi surged out from within Chen Xiang, and he opened his mouth and emitted a thunderous roar.Similar to that of a dragon, it made everyone\u2019s eardrum tingle. The most shocking thing was that what came out of Chen Xiang\u2019s mouth was a large amount of azure coloured True Qi, flying towards Chen Zhenhua and inundating him.The True Qi transformed into an Azure dragon, the kind of diffusing vicissitudes of an ancient dragon and shocking everyone around. It could be seen that this True Qi was very strong and couldn\u2019t be practiced out from an ordinary sutra.When Chen Xiang emitted the dragon roar, everyone present near the field became transfixed. They watched Chen Xiang with a face full of surprise, and if they had not witnessed Chen Xiang emitting this tyrannical True Qi, they wouldn\u2019t have believed it!Chen Tianhu saw how amazing his son is, and it made him extremely proud, excited and slightly agitated. The complexion of Chen Haohai and his followers became extremely ugly, as they were well aware of how frightening that True Qi was.Chen Xiang\u2019s [Azure Dragon Roar] instantly shattered Chen Zhenhua\u2019s [Heavenly Sun Axe Strike] like as if it were gla.s.s. The True Qi storm that surged from within his mouth contained a very frightening and destructive power. Chen Zhenhua\u2019s entire body was filled with bloodstains.This [Azure Dragon Roar] was also from the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]. The dragon roar produced by Chen Xiang was similar to an original dragon's roar. Its might would devastate both a person\u2019s heart and soul. Also from within his mouth a lightning and wind storm burst forth, and the power of the wind was similar to a knife attacking the enemy. It was incomparably overbearing.No one even dared to blink, for the fear of missing something and Chen Xiang did not disappoint them. Just moments after Chen Xiang\u2019s roar, his body flew like that of a dragon. Appearing instantly in front of the still dazed and panic stricken Chen Zhenhua.Chen Xiang fingers stretched and an azure aura flashed from his arm, taking the shape of a dragon\u2019s claw, strong and vigorous, and surged with the extremely tyrannical Azure Dragon True Qi. Just like how an eagle catches a rabbit as quick as lightning, he caught Chen Zhenhua\u2019s head and grasped it instantaneously. The claw opened abruptly, like a dragon\u2019s claw! The claws were as sharp as knifes and the scales were clearly visible.With the sudden appearance of an Azure dragon claw covering the head of Chen Zhenhua, a sharp and slaughtering Qi burst forth, and everyone\u2019s heart shook. They all saw that after Chen Zhenhua\u2019s head was covered with the dragon claw, he emitted a pitiful loud scream, and Chen Zhenhua retreated a few steps while vomiting blood!This was the [Azure Dragon Claw], the super strong offensive martial technique of the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise].Everyone saw Chen Zhenhua\u2019s bloodied body and his face was full of horror. They were having a very hard time believing what just happened. Chen Xiang defeated Chen Zhenhua in a flash and in such a beautiful way!\u201cBang\u201dChen Zhenhua fell down, and everyone was shocked. They felt cold in their spine and only now confirmed what had happened!Abnormally powerful azure True Qi, a strange and frightening martial technique, emitting a tyrannical power and all of this was all done by Chen Xiang who did not even have a Spiritual Vein.Chen Haohai watched his son getting severely wounded and he could not help but vomit blood. He saw Chen Zhenhua was still breathing and converged his Qi with his son. Although Chen Zhenhua was covered with multiple scars, he was not seriously injured, which showed that Chen Xiang was holding back.Chen Haohai looked at Chen Tianhu with a face full of grat.i.tude while Chen Tianhu just smiled at him.\u201cThis can only be blamed at his half-a.s.sed skills, it\u2019s no wonder he got wounded so easily!\u201d Chen Xiang said dismissively.Chen Xiang\u2019s expression in his eyes were clear, neither cold nor dull: \u201cI can now fight on behalf of my father!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Battle of Great DisparityNot only was Chen Xiang such a young alchemist, but he had also the entered the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Even with such accomplishments, he had neither shown any arrogance or pride. This subtlety had made the Chen family branch commanders and elders secretly appreciate his behaviour.Chen Xiang looked at the middle-aged man standing beside Chen Haohai. He was Chen Haohai\u2019s little brother Chen Yihan, a 7th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioner! He was a handsome man with a beard. He gradually walked towards Chen Xiang and had not spoken since the beginning.Chen Xiang was to do battle with him, but he only had the strength of a 5th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioner.No one dared to leave, as such a thing had actually happened in the Chen family Patriarch election and it was something n.o.body had expected.Chen Yihan saw his nephew being defeated, but he did not even show a trace of anger and with a mystical smile he said, \u201cNo matter how talented you are, you are still going to lose against a 7th level Mortal Martial Realm expert.\u201dChen Yihan had to admit, if Chen Xiang were to be given a few years worth of time, then he would not even stand a chance against him. But that was the future, and presently the chance of him winning was a 100%.Chen Yihan practiced with Ice True Qi and in the Chen family, this type of True Qi pract.i.tioner was special.Out of the Chen family\u2019s junior generation, none dared to challenge a senior who was at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. If they heard someone attempting this before, they would think of it as madness. No one would believe it, but now that all of the Chen family members saw how fierce Chen Xiang\u2019s techniques were, their hearts were filled with uncertainty.But most of them still believed that Chen Xiang would lose, after all, not only was there a large gap in age, but also in strength. Not to mention Chen Yihan had practiced many high-grade martial techniques, even his True Qi was much more vigorous and not a single young pract.i.tioner had the capability to compete with Chen Yihan.A battle of great disparity, where the gap in power was too large, was about to begin. Everyone was watching quietly as this was the deciding match to determine the next Patriarch of the family!Chen Xiang had practiced the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] for only two months and he had the Yin and Yang Divine Vein. He had spent a large amount of time absorbing the Spirit Qi between heaven and earth, enhancing the True Qi within himself. After all, he was simultaneously cultivating five True Qi whirlpools that had five different kinds of attributes so his True Qi was much more vigorous.Also between the 5th level True Qi Realm and the 7th level True Aura Realm, there was the the 6th level Divine Sense Realm. Divine sense was although the cultivation of your spirit, it could congeal a kind of controlling True Qi type spiritual power. This provides major a.s.sistance in controlling True Qi and with time, it could also strengthen one\u2019s True Qi. After having cultivated the divine sense, one can then start cultivating the True Qi Aura Force.Chen Yihan was at the 7th level True Aura realm and he could use his fierce Qi Aura. It was not something that True Qi could match up to, so he had absolute confidence that he would be able to defeat Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang\u2019s frightening martial skill could deter everyone, but those who had knowledge regarding True Qi could see that Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi was very \u201cimmature\u201d and it could not be compared to Qi Aura. However it was still very powerful when compared to others in the same level as him.Chen Yihan gradually moved towards Chen Xiang, and with every step he takes, the temperature dropped rapidly. Freezing cold air was blowing all around, and most people could see that Chen Yihan was on the verge of a breakthrough, the icy True Qi of his was extremely strong.Chen Xiang was not too far away from Chen Yihan, and he felt that this kind of freezing cold was most profound. At this time Chen Yihan congealed out True Qi Aura, which can only be achieved at 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Chen Xiang used the Vermillion Bird True Qi within his body which was a fire attributed True Qi. After being affected by the cold Qi, Chen Xiang became stimulated. The Vermillion Bird True Qi started rus.h.i.+ng from within his dantian into his numerous bones and four limbs. After feeling the comfortable warmth brought out by the Vermillion Bird True Qi, Chen Xiang\u2019s body was finally restored from the sudden stiffness.\u201cHe he he\u201dChen Yihan\u2019s sinister laugh resounded throughout the entire area, and suddenly a white icy Qi started overflowing from the centre of his palm. The threatening freezing cold Qi Aura was clearly discernible and directly rushed towards Chen Xiang\u2019s head.Chen Xiang saw that his opponent was making a move, and he slid forward, as slippery and flexible as a snake. Sliding quickly to the front while trying to avoid Chen Yihan\u2019s attack, he also unexpectedly attacked.Chen Xiang\u2019s treading was flexible and mysterious, and both of his hands transformed into dragon claws. Mesmerizing Azure Dragon True Qi overflowed from both of his hands and this was the same [Azure Dragon Claw] used to defeat Chen Zhenhua previously. But this time, he brought out a dragon claw from both his hands which caused everyone to hold their breath in antic.i.p.ation.\u201cHumph!\u201d Chen Yihan emitted a cold sneer, and two icy Qi palms boldly shot towards Chen Xiang\u2019s dragon claws. When Chen Yihan\u2019s palms struck Chen Xiang\u2019s dragon claws, a cold Qi gushed out and Chen Xiang\u2019s pair of Azure dragon claws suddenly shattered. Chen Xiang\u2019s arms were covered with a thick layer of ice, and frosty Qi was permeating into his body and causing his entire self to stiffen up.Chen Yihan smiled coldly, and from his feet frost congealed out and he slightly jumped. He vigorously kicked Chen Xiang\u2019s cheek which flung Chen Xiang ten feet away.Chen Xiang fell on the ground, his cheek sheared due to the sharp ice, and drawing a few scars.The ice which was covering his arms also broke, but both his hands were actually frozen stiff. The Tai Chi diagram from the divine exercise started revolving and absorbing the cold Qi flowing inside his body, while allowing the fiery Vermillion Bird True Qi to surge into his arms, getting rid of the cold pain.Chen Xiang now only realized that even though he had a divine exercise, the gap between the two of them was still too large, but he still he had to win.\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..I have to acknowledge that out of all the geniuses that have ever been born in the Chen family, you are the greatest one yet, but you and your father are too arrogant!\u201dChen Yihan with an evil smile, step by step moved towards Chen Xiang, as he was in no hurry to kill Chen Xiang. He wants to tear Chen Xiang into numerous pieces in front of the Chen family members, to show his strength and deter everyone.Suddenly, Chen Xiang with a flip actually stood up, and everyone thought he was seriously injured from the kick a moment ago, but it looked like nothing had happened to him. Including Chen Yihan, everyone was surprised.On the sidelines where Chen Tianhu was watching, he let out a sigh of relief while transferring Qi to heal himself.Seeing that Chen Xiang had not taken that much damage, Chen Yihan leaped forward. Moving with elegance and gentleness, for everyone present, this agility skill was pleasing to the eye.With Chen Yihan approaching, Chen Xiang felt that he was inside a world full of ice and snow, and below his feet were covered with a layer of frost.Chen Yihan leaped, and the freezing cold fist felt like it was strong enough to shake the skies. His fist instantaneously landed on Chen Xiang\u2019s chest, and blood started to flow from where he was just struck, but it was immediately covered with frost.\u201cIt is the [Profound Ice Aura Energy]! A High Grade Profound Level Martial Skill, releasing it can even pierce metal and break stone!\u201d Chen Tianhu spoke with a dignified tone.After being hit, Chen Xiang almost simultaneously dodged the incoming flying kick coming from Chen Yihan, resulting in Chen Yihan\u2019s kick to be covered with a layer of ice when it landed on the ground, and shattering a large amount of bricks and it also crushed stones from the shock and froze them.\u201cCasting Qi Aura has two weaknesses, it consumes True Qi and divine sense quickly, but if he does not use Qi Aura, you will not get injured!\u201d Chen Tianhu said.Chen Xiang knew that he could only drag the battle on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Fusion of the Five Elements\u201cWell it's useless. I have a very large amount of True Qi. You probably won't be able to drag it out for long and be the first one to fall.\u201d Chen Yihan objected. He resumed his onslaught against Chen Xiang, delivering countless strikes against him. Even before the flurry of attacks, Chen Xiang was injured. Now that Chen Yihan continued to keep up the pressure, he was confident that Chen Xing would soon die by his hand.Chen Yihan blasted fist after fist, continuously attacking with his [Profound Ice Aura Energy]. He also delivered the attacks from a long range away, so that Chen Xiang could not retaliate and only endure.\u201cHahaha\u2026 Just a moment ago you kept on proclaiming that you must fight on behalf of your father. But now look, you don\u2019t even have the strength to resist!\u201d Chen Yihan emitted a shrill laugh. On Chen Xiang\u2019s body, many b.l.o.o.d.y holes were emerging due to the strikes caused by the [Profound Ice Aura Energy] which burst out from the inside of his skin.Chen Xiang took a deep breath while revolving the Tai Chi Yin Yang diagram within his body. With the help of his spiritual power, he controlled the five-elements of True Qi stored inside his body and proceeded to fuse them together.The five elements of True Qi started to converge. Right now, the only chance of winning for Chen Xiang was to simultaneously use the five elements of True Qi. However, after the five elements of True Qi were done fusing together, it would become intrepid and wild. His current meridians were not be able to bear the strain.Fusing together the five elements of True Qi had never been attempted by anyone before this, mainly because n.o.body ever had the opportunity. Chen Xiang was the first to embark on this mysterious domain which could be called pure insanity. If he was unable to control the Qi, Qigong Deviation would occur and as a result Chen Xiang would die.However, he was successful. Although he felt his meridians threatening to rupture, within his dantian, the five elements of True Qi had actually been perfectly fused together. But it was still much harder to control, and a large amount of True Qi was lost from his meridians. Chen Xiang knew that he must act quickly, before the True Qi was exhausted. He needed to use this frightening power to defeat Chen Yihan.A violent aura suddenly exploded from Chen Xiang. Chen Yihan\u2019s heart could not help but thump, as the True Qi that suddenly appeared gave off the impression of an overbearing and tyrannical nature that would not hesitate to destroy anything in its path.\u201cAh...\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s body was in pain due to the impact from the violent True Qi, and he could not help but howl in pain. Suddenly, visible oppressive Qi waves started to pour out. A howl engulfed everything around them like a sea, as the whole field fiercely shook. All the bricks near Chen Xiang started to shatter.Everything in the entire world was const.i.tuted of the five elements. By fusing together the five elemental forces, it would contain the heaven and universe. At the moment, Chen Xiang had fused together the five elemental forces and formed the universe\u2019s power, the Universal True Qi!\u201cFall down!\u201d from within Chen Yihan\u2019s body, an icy Qi burst forth. The more he felt threatened by Chen Xiang, the more he wanted to end the battle and quickly defeat Chen Xiang in order to prevent him from being victorious.Lightning was flas.h.i.+ng in Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes. He moved towards Chen Yihan with large strides, and the soles of his feet were filled with the universal force containing a destructive nature. Each of his steps broke the floor tiles on impact. The momentum from his intense speed was like that of a herd of ten thousand steeds.\u201c[Profound Ice Aura Energy]!\u201d Chen Yihan eyebrows twitched as he looked at Chen Xiang. Both his fists moved together as two more intrepid freezing cold aura energies sprayed a cold qi strike towards Chen Xiang.At this moment Chen Xiang\u2019s mental state was similar to a maniac. In his mind there was only one thought; to defeat Chen Yihan.The two [Profound Ice Aura Energy] were able to tear stones apart on impact. Chen Xiang roared as he caught the frightening aura energies with both of his palms. A layer of ice momentarily covered his arms, but was broken in just an instant while never stopping his charge.It only took a moment for Chen Xiang to arrive in front of Chen Yihan. His pair of fists struck forward, each producing a True Qi explosion. This turned out to be the very common High Grade Mortal Level Martial Skill, [Storm Killing Fist]. With each fist, a True Qi explosion would be produced, and it was extremely lethal but in return it consumed a lot of True Qi.As each fist moved through the air, thunderous Qi waves were emitted. Yet even with this, Chen Xiang\u2019s fists were lightning quick. Fist after fist, the waves of blows surged without break, almost as if executing the [Storm Killing Fist] did not consume any True Qi.Chen Xiang had casted the [Storm Killing Fist] with Universal True Qi. This frightening level of power made everyone\u2019s heart tremble. This level of attack was actually equal to Qi Aura!Chen Yihan also had to use Qi Aura in order to resist Chen Xiang\u2019s wild[ Storm Killing Fists], which fell towards his body like rain on the ground. As he resisted each blow, his heart could not help but sink. The violent True Qi explosion even made him feel fear. If even one fist managed to strike him, getting seriously injured would be unavoidable.Even after a few more breaths of time, Chen Xiang continuously blasted dozens of [Storm Killing Fists].Chen Tianhu\u2019s eyes were wide open. His son was actually this incredibly valiant, but he could tell that Chen Xiang\u2019s situation was actually not that good. To display power which transcends one\u2019s limit, was essentially damaging to their own body.\u201cMotherf****r...\u201d Chen Yihan continued to resist those crazy [Storm Killing Fists]. He could not help but curse. For everyone else, it was their first time seeing someone using [Storm Killing Fist] in such a peculiar manner. It was also the first time they understood that this High Grade Mortal Level Martial Skill could unexpectedly become this frightening.The Universal True Qi was intensely draining for Chen Xiang\u2019s body. He was regretting in his heart, he felt that if the True Qi inside him was consumed and Chen Yihan was still not defeated, then he was doomed.Chen Xiang suddenly opened his mouth and let loose a giant roar. A dragon\u2019s roar resounded through the horizon. Chen Xiang ejected a violent clear True Qi from his mouth, submerging Chen Yihan\u2019s figure in one shout.This was the [Azure Dragon Roar], but this time colourless Universal True Qi was surging out. Inside the roar was Lighting, Flame, Water, Ice and various other kinds of attributes.Chen Yihan did not expect Chen Xiang to suddenly cast a large move. He quickly retreated to open up a gap between them while operating his True Qi. He started releasing his Qi Aura to create an ice cover to try and resist this violent True Qi attack.Suddenly, in Chen Xiang\u2019s hands, appeared a broadsword that was gleaming with a cold light.[TLN: Broadsword (\u5927\u5200)]Chen Xiang\u2019s whole body was emitting a violent True Qi. He pulled back the blade and with a yell, poured all of his remaining True Qi into the blade. This let loose a burst of glaring azure aura that exuded a sharp dragon roar that cracked stone and penetrated the clouds. The sight was mesmerizing to the hearts and souls of those present.Chen Xiang leapt into the sky. His blade that was boosted with azure light left only a blur to be seen. Slicing the air with irresistible force, the blade hacked towards Chen Yihan\u2019s head.\u201cNo!...\u201d From the distance a voices resounded. The broadsword had been chopped dowards with an intent to split Chen Yihan in half, but the blade stopped right next to his neck.Receiving that quick and powerful attack from Chen Xiang, violent True Qi surged out in all four directions as everyone stood like a stone carving in-situ, blankly staring at Chen Xiang holding that broadsword.Everyone was shocked speechless by Chen Xiang\u2019s crazy and overbearing martial might. How was he a waste with no Spiritual Vein? He is simply a frightening monster!A sixteen year old yet defeating a 7th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioner! It was simply a miracle!In addition, Chen Xiang was also an alchemist!Their family gave birth to this type of genius, this fact alone made many of the Chen family member\u2019s hearts incomparably excited.\u201cChen Xiang________Chen Xiang_______Chen Xiang!\u201d Many people were shouting Chen Xiang\u2019s name in unison. Within their hearts, their feelings could not help but give way to newfound pride.Before, everyone thought that Chen Xiang accepting the challenge of the Yao Family genius would be similar to fighting a hopeless battle. But looking back on it now, Chen Xiang was completely sure about winning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Immortal and Devil PoolInside the field, Chen Tianhu arrived at the side of the injured Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan. Facing them he said \u201cYou and I were all competing for the Patriarch's position. I did not hope to end it such a way! We are Chen Family members and we should all be united. If you refuse to accept me as your Patriarch, you can take your followers and leave the Chen Family.Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan both glanced at each other before looking towards Chen Xiang and heaving heavy sighs.Chen Haohai firmly grasped Chen Tianhu\u2019s arm. With a heavy tone he said, \u201cI hope you can lead the Chen Family. I, Chen Haohai, have lived as a Chen Family member and even after death I will become a Chen Family ghost! I, Chen Haohai, am sincerely convinced by the new Patriarch!\u201dChen Haohai and Chen Yihan were not fools. They had gained insight on how frightening Chen Xiang\u2019s potential is. If he is cultivated well, soon he will have very good chances to become a fierce alchemist. If you could build a good relation now, you can reap the benefits later. It is not wise to offend a top-level alchemist, plus, Chen Tianhu was now letting go of all the past enmities, which is good thing for them.\u201cTwo seniors, for the previous offences please forgive me. For our Chen Family to survive in these lands for many years, we must not have internal strife.\u201d Chen Xiang gave his apologies after arriving in front of Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan.Chen Xiang\u2019s statements and actions caused many Chen Family children and elders to secretly nod in approval. Although at such a young age he had already defeated a formidable Elder, he was not proud, but actually very modest. This kind of subtlety is quite rare among many of the Chen Family juniors.The Chen brothers were also somewhat ashamed.\u201cMy dear nephew, first go and recuperate! Dragging the injuries for a long time can be detrimental to future cultivation.\u201d Chen Yihan said, while pa.s.sing some of his healing dans.For the the Elder Compet.i.tion to reach such a conclusion, made the other Elders quite satisfied.An Elder with a clear and resonant voice said \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, the banquet will take place after ten days, but I also request for everyone to stay after as well. By that time, many other families will have sent someone to partic.i.p.ate. At that point, it would be a good opportunity for you to make friends with the other families.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Chen Xian returned to his room. While looking at his scarred body, he could not help but let loose a deep breath. Just before, his fight with Chen Yihan was very dangerous. Yet at this moment, his mind was excited because at the 5th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he has the strength to defeat someone at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm!After giving his all in the previous fight, he also felt like his power level had somewhat increased. He had gained a lot of experience in utilizing Qi. No wonder he had heard that in order to become a powerful martial artist, one needed to go through numerous battles.Just as Chen Xiang was about to take the healing pills, two auras reflected onto his eyes. He blinked, only to see Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao with straight faces standing right in front of him.\u201cYou brat! Just a moment ago, you were too rash, what would we do if you had died? We have poured too much effort into your body!\u201d shouted Bai Youyou with a cold expression. Chen Xiang felt a cold chill running down his spine.Su Meiyao stuck her tongue out and said \u201cAfter considering the circ.u.mstance, devilish brat, you were somewhat courageous. This time, we will let you off the hook! However, next time you must be cautious! Take off your clothes, I will help you apply the ointments.During Chen Xiang and Chen Yihan\u2019s battle, his body was covered in many cuts due to the Icy True Aura. His body was covered in numerous bloodstains. If it was not specially treated, it would be harder to heal.Thus, Chen Xiang was now lying on his bed enjoying the soft and tender hands of Su Meiyao applying some ointments, which made him feel very comfortable\u2026In accordance with custom, the other families were invited to celebrate the newly elected Chen Family Patriarch. However, it takes quite some time for the other families to arrive, so the actual celebration is held sometime later.But at this banquet, everyone\u2019s attention was on the expected alchemy compet.i.tion between Chen Xiang and the Yao Family genius! Everyone was discussing this coming alchemy compet.i.tion, so at this time, many people were coming to the banquet. Many came to see the Chen Family get humiliated. The Chen Family\u2019s security was very tight so news of Chen Xiang\u2019s recent achievements did not spread.In the morning, a drop of azure essence was spat out by Chen Xiang. This dewdrop was congealed from his use of the \u201cDragon Saliva Exercise\u201d. He wants to grasp more alchemy techniques in the upcoming ten days and wants to try refining a Mortal Level Middle Grade Pill.At his age, to congeal a Mortal Level Middle Grade \u201cQuenching Body Dan\u201d was enough to be compared with legendary genius alchemists, and even transcend many of them!\u201cYou want to refine mortal level middle-grade in this short time? It is somewhat difficult, but I Su Meiyao like to do these kind of challenging things.\u201d Su Meiyao\u2019s gentle voice transmitted through Chen Xiang\u2019s mind.Chen Xiang while laughing said: \u201cSister Meiyao, then quickly teach me!\u201dSu Meiyao with a soft smile said \u201cDon\u2019t grin that happily! This will come with a price. Although you are quite skilled in refining Mortal Level Low Grade Dans, and even have a bit of experience in refining Middle Grade Dans, your spiritual power is not enough! You need to be at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Then, with divine sense, you will become able to accurately manipulate the flames, and with enough control, instantly congeal the dans!\u201dChen Xiang, while nodding his head, said \u201cWell on the side, I will accelerate the growth of the Mortal Level Middle Grade Spirit Herb, while elevating my power level. I hope to catch up before the day of the alchemy compet.i.tion!\u201dSu Meiyao said \u201cIn order to practice Divine Sense, you need a large amount of True Qi and Spiritual Power to successfully fuse together into Divine Sense. There is a certain level of difficulty, but since you practice the Tai Chi Divine Exercise, this process should be a lot fast. Still, doing it in ten days is doubtful!Chen Xiang let loose a small sigh, he has been too impatient and this was a big taboo!\u201cWell\u2026 there is still a way to quickly elevate your strength.\u201d Su Meiyao said with a mysterious smile said.\u201cHow?\u201d Chen Xiang asked quickly.Suddenly Bai Youyou transmits with her ice cold voice \u201cImmortal and Devil Pool.\u201dAt this moment, Chen Xiang remembered that below the \u2018Immortal and devil cliff\u2019 there was a strange pool. When he had fallen down there, he was able to breathe inside it. Moreover, the pool was also s.h.i.+ning. But besides that, he did not discover anything special about it.\u201cIs that the weird pool at the bottom of the cliff?\u201d Chen Xiang asked with uncertainty.\u201cYes, you should know we were forced by our personal enemy into that pool\u201d Su Meiyao words made Chen Xiang somewhat curious. It turned out, these two peerless martial arts girls were dropped there.\u201cIn the end, how is that place mystical?\u201d The more Chen Xiang thought about it the more suspicious he got. This was because that \u2018Immortal and devil cliff\u2019 was perennially filled with Death Qi, yet for some reason there was no trace of Death Qi near that pool.After Chen Xiang learned that the \u2018Immortal and devil pool\u2019 is out of the ordinary, he immediately mixed \u2018Dragon saliva\u2019 into the water, then poured in various spirit herbs and flowers. Following that, he greeted his father, and quietly left the Chen family villa, taking a trip to the Immortal and Devil cliff.On the way, he listened to Su Meiyao describing things about the \u2018Immortal and devil cliff\u2019.\u201cThat place is called the Immortal and Devil Cliff because that place was where immortals and devils are buried. That pool was transformed from the pure energy that was emitted from their corpses. Someone intentionally created that pool, and the Death Qi near its surroundings are also caused due to the overflow from the Immortals and Devils corpses.\u201d Su Meiyao said.Chen Xiang was horrified. Immortals and Devil are legendary beings and he completely did not expect their corpses to lie there! This also made him incomparably excited, if that pool truly is made up of pure energy and he managed to obtain it...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Vermillion Bird Fire WingsChen Xiang arrived at the Immortal and Devil Cliff while looking down at the black colored Death Qi he muttered, \u201cIn this world are there really Immortals and Devils?\u201dSu Meiyao retorted with a soft snort, \u201dOf course. Do not think that the True Martial Realm is the strongest state for martial pract.i.tioners. Above the True Martial Realm there are three further extreme stages, and then after this there is the Nirvana Realm! After a successful nirvana, one will be able to enter the Heaven Martial Realm, reaching a huge spatial world, called Heaven Martial World!\u201d\u201cDo not think about those ma.s.sive worlds, the world we are living in is called the Mortal Martial World and it is also vast. The Spirit Qi is very thin here, so there are very few acc.u.mulations of demon beasts! Those truly strong martial arts pract.i.tioners travel to places with very rich Spirit Qi. There strong martial artists are as plentiful as the clouds and there are many demon beasts. However it is also considered very dangerous. If one don\u2019t have a certain amount of strength, death is inevitable in that region.\u201dIt was the first time Chen Xiang had heard about the world of martial arts and it surprised him. However, it also made him realize just how insignificant he was. Before he used to think the True Martial Realm was very powerful, but he never imagined that there were stages above the True Martial Realm.\u201cBrat, this Mortal Martial World is vast, there are many mainlands besides this one. In some of these mainlands, there are many formidable martial artists and in this endless world, there are many hidden realms. In these hidden realms, you can find many heavenly forged treasures. While also being very dangerous, as long you have enough strength, you\u2019ll be able to experience the vastness of the whole martial world. Currently, you just have to understand just how tiny and insignificant you are.\u201d Bai Youyou said coldly.Chen Xiang tightened his fist. This time, he had a brief outlook of the world, and only by constantly elevating his strength would it allow him to take foothold in this martial world where the strong are as trees in a forest, st.u.r.dy and unmoving.Chen Xiang jumped down into the abyss; currently, he was in the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and there was a pool beneath him. Considering his strength, he did not need to waste time to climb down slowly.SPLAs.h.!.+Chen Xiang once again entered the pool with white light emitting from it. Abyssal demon beasts frequently appeared next to the pool, but Chen Xiang did not fret about it, because the strength of these infested demon beasts were average and Chen Xiang\u2019s current strength was more than sufficient enough to deal with them.\u201cMeiyao sister, how can I use the Immortal and Devil Pool?\u201d Chen Xiang asked while churning the strange water with his hands. Excluding the fact that the water was s.h.i.+ning he did not think there was anything strange about this place.Su Meiyao spoke, \u201cAfter the death of the Immortals and Devils, a great mult.i.tude of pure energy flew out of their corpses, but you can not absorb these energies, after all, it\u2019s not your energy. However, you can only use the energy to refine the body and the spirit! But it is a very painful process.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s brow wrinkled: \u201cHow long should I stay in the Immortal and Devil Pool?\u201dSu Meiyao: \u201cI don't know. I suppose you can stay until you cannot bear the pain. You just have to jump inside the pool and start operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] while simply trying to guide the energies into your body.\u201dChen Xiang, without any delay, took off his clothes and jumped inside, submerging himself in the pool. He could breathe normally underwater, so he had nothing to worry about. Moreover, this protected him from the attacks of the demon beasts.After submerging himself, Chen Xiang began operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise]. Suddenly he felt that his body was being squeezed from all four directions by a bizarre power, as if to make his body to squeeze together to form a ball, which made him constantly wary.At the same time, a bizarre kind of energy madly rushed into his body. It continuously bombarded every part of his body as it flowed. He felt as if his body was about to burst. Every bone felt as if small insects were biting them and it was a feeling worse than death itself.Some blisters were constantly emerging from the Immortal and Devil Pool, and the water also churned continuously. This was all because of Chen Xiang was frantically struggling in the pool from below.After an unknown amount of time, Chen Xiang\u2019s body started to float from the pool below. He was lying on the edge of the pool, and panting heavily; he said, \u201cHow have I not yet entered into the 6th level of Mortal Martial Realm?\u201d\u201cDo you think you can breakthrough this quickly? You are currently only refining the body so that your whole body becomes more powerful while also elevating your spirit!\u201d Su Meiyao\u2019s voice transmitted into his mind.Chen Xiang stood up, gripping both his fists, and felt his strong body. Although he had yet to enter into the 6th level of Mortal Martial Realm, a solid foundation was set.\u201cHow many days was I under?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. He had been subjected to unimaginable pain in the Immortal and Devil Pool without any concept of time.\u201cOnly five days. Although this Immortal and Devil Pool has little use, it still lets you practice the basics of the [Immortal Devil Body] Su Meiyao said. Chen Xiang\u2019s heart was secretly shocked about this [Immortal Devil Body], and listening to the name he knew it was very formidable.Immortal and Devil Cliff. In the abyss below there was a roaring burst occasionally, as well as a weak surge of strange True Qi. The True Qi was filled with the sense of an ancient atmosphere of vicissitudes, surging with an inexplicable pressure. That True Qi was Chen Xiang releasing his Azure Dragon True Qi by practicing the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]..Chen Xiang did not leave the Immortal and Devil Cliff, but still practiced below with a bare chest. On his iron fist azure True Qi was boldly rising, continuously bombarding the cliff, and broken stones violently flew. Hhis whole body was filled with True Qi. He released numerous strikes making a small cave in the cliff, but his breath however, remained stable showing that his True Qi and body strength were now much more vigorous.With every fist, True Qi would rebound, directly surging from his arm into his head, and sudden spiritual power acc.u.mulated inside his brain, developing his brain and enhancing his spiritual power. This was one of the methods to practice divine sense.When Chen Xiang was practicing below, the commotion was not small. An originally silent abyss was now rumbling with sounds, resounding throughout the abyss.After two days, Chen Xiang felt his True Qi was now full, and his spiritual power was much more enhanced, and as long as he opened his soul sea, he could advance to the 6th level of the Mortal Matial Realm, the Divine Sense Realm. To breakthrough one needed his spiritual power to be vigorous.[TLN: Divine sense (\u795e\u8bc6) can be referred to spirit sense or simply soul, since spirit is used in many places I used divine sense, and not soul because it felt appropriate because \u201cusing divine sense\u201d felt better than \u201cusing soul\u201d]\u201cPrepare to break through the level 6 threshold!\u201d Chen Xiang took a long breath. After two days of practice, he could feel how tyrannical his body was, and this was all due to the refinement in the Immortal and Devil Pool.Chen Xiang sat cross-legged on the ground, closing his eyes and with rapt attention operated the True Qi within his body. While releasing his spiritual power, he let the two blend, using spiritual power to sense the soul gate, and using the True Qi to break it open!The profound heart law of the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] was directing Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi and spiritual power to seek the soul gate hidden inside his soul. Soon, Chen Xiang saw a golden door as if it was right in front of his eyes.Seeing the door meant the Divine Sense Realm was right in front of him, condensed right between the eyebrows, and moving with one thought. Azure True Qi suddenly transformed into a claw, then into a solemn Azure Dragon. The True Qi that transformed into an Azure Dragon gave a fierce roar and hit that golden gate.As the Azure Dragon hit the door, it blew outward with a \u201cbang\u201d sound. Chen Xiang saw a glaring golden aura. At the same time he opened his eyes and a tough True Qi flowed in every part of his body, and he couldn\u2019t help but yell in surprise. The five elements of True Qi violently surged out from inside his body, raising the fierce wind, and blowing out in all four directions.\u201cIs this 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm?\u201d Chen Xiang closed his eyes while feeling his internal vigorous and formidable True Qi, simultaneously releasing his divine sense, and the slightest sign of trouble all around was within his grasp!Chen Xiang opens his eyes, slightly smiled: \u201cThis time I can use that trick!\u201dBehind his back a sudden burst of fiery aura could be seen. The flames transformed into a pair of gigantic wings rising behind his back. A fiery aura burst out with a flash and heat waves rose, looking like a pair Phoenix wings.\u201c[Vermillion Bird Fire Wings]! Fly!\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s laughter came forth, as his Fire Wings fluttered upward, and just within a few blinks of time, his silhouette was gone into the black Death Qi.This is where the 6th level of Mortal Martial realm showed its power! By controlling internal True Qi with the powerful divine sense to keep it solidified, Chen Xiang\u2019s internal True Qi could be released outside, to transform into wings and fly into the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Yao FamilyChen Xiang was standing above the Immortal and Devil Cliff, he had put away his [Vermillion Bird Fire Wings]. To transform True Qi into wings required a very high-grade technique. He practiced the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] which, of course, included these types of martial techniques.As Chen Xiang arrived at the top of the Immortal and Devil Cliff, he heard sounds of fighting coming from below. Although the distance was quite far away, he was able to hear it clearly through his divine sense. Chen Xiang immediately started to fly towards it. If it was just an ordinary battle, he wouldn\u2019t pay the slightest attention, but the sounds of fighting were deafening and created large impacts. Chen Xiang deduced from this that it was no ordinary martial battle.Chen Xiang flew silently through the air, arriving before a forest clearing. There he saw two handsome teenagers against five black robed a.s.sailants.The two seemed rather frail, but their strength was satisfactory. They were matching the five black robed people\u2019s knife techniques, but their True Qi was not potent enough. If they continued to delay, they would certainly end up being killed by the five black-robed people.\u201cIt seems to be the Xue Family imaginary sword technique, where the aura illuminating from the sword produces illusions, making it difficult to distinguish between opponents!\u201d Chen Xiang read various martial art books in his lifetime, and could instantly identify the sword style with just a glance.After learning they were Xue Family members, Chen Xiang could not idly sit by. After all, Xue Xianxian was his fianc\u00e9e, additionally the Chen and Xue Families had a close relations.h.i.+p.\u201cWatch out!\u201dChen Xiang shouted. His body seemed like an azure rainbow as he flew towards the commotion. His hand transformed into a dragon\u2019s claw as it headed straight towards the head of a black-robed man. He roared at the same moment as an Azure True Qi wave gushed out from inside his mouth, covering the black robe man. Along with the [Azure Dragon Roar], Chen Xiang\u2019s [Azure Dragon Claw] grasped the head of the black robed man. In an instant, the black-robed man\u2019s skull shattered into shards of bone and flesh.This sudden scene of insane brute force stunned the remaining four black robed men and the two Xue Family members. The True Qi that was embodied with the majesty of the Azure Dragon caused their hearts to be shocked from fear. Of course, the most shocking thing to them was the martial technique that they had never seen before.After Chen Xiang broke the skull of the black robed man, the dragon claw immediately transformed back into a fist striking towards another black robed man. In an instant, he struck dozens of times, forming afterimages like the wind. They were sent whistling towards the astonished black-robed man. The blows pounded onto his body and after the strike, emitted a series of explosions. This was the [Storm Killing Fist]!Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi was now much more potent, and so casting [Storm Killing Fist] was quite simple and easy. He did not have to worry about the consumption of True Qi, and each fist\u2019s explosive power was phenomenal. It was quite difficult to resist, not to mention the fact that he could instantly use this technique multiple times.With a moment of effort, Chen Xiang had defeated another black-robed man. After that display, the two Xue family teenagers finally reacted and continued to attack with their swords.After Chen Xiang had joined the fight. The remaining black-robed men began to retreat after witnessing their two defeats. They were soon beaten and seriously injured, and they did not expect this type of result.\u201cThanks a lot for the rescue, esteemed senior brother.\u201d One slightly tall teenager said while cupping his fist, \u201cThis one is called little brother Xue Ming.\u201d\u201cXue Zhilang!\u201d The other teenager said while cupping his fist, \u201cThanks a lot for coming to the rescue, great brother.\u201dAlthough Chen Xiang was only sixteen years old, he was very big and tall, so he looked relatively more mature.\u201cNo need to be so polite, I am called Chen Xiang! Our Chen and Xue family have had a friends.h.i.+p for many generations, so this is a must.\u201d Chen Xiang also replied with courtesy. This caused Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang\u2019s countenance to change; they had not expected their savior to be Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang was quite famous in the Xue family because their beloved daughter of the heavens, Xue Xianxian, was Chen Xiang\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. However, many juniors of the Xue family were not in favor of Chen Xiang because they knew Chen Xiang did does not have a martial pract.i.tioner\u2019s spiritual vein. They were thus was amazed at Chen Xiang\u2019s display of strength.\u201cAre you really Chen Xiang?\u201d Xue Ming found it somewhat hard to believe.Chen Xiang while nodding and smiling said, \u201cOf course, you two should be here to attend our Chen family\u2019s banquet right?\u201dXue Ming and Xue Zhilang nodded their heads. Although they were uncertain, they did not question Chen Xiang anymore, after all, it would be impolite. This person was their savior.\u201cWhat is the origin of these people? Why were they trying to a.s.sa.s.sinate you?\u201d Chen Xiang looked at the three injured black-robed men on the ground.Xue Ming said, \u201cThey are killers from an unknown organization. Their strength should be at the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm; we met them on the way.\u201dXue Ming and Xue Zhilang beheaded the remaining three. They did not uncover anything from their possessions, and they also did not intend to interrogate them. Since these a.s.sa.s.sins were specially trained, they would not open their mouth even in death.\u201cGreat brother Chen, you should have entered the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm! Otherwise, you could not have easily killed those two black-robed men!\u201d Xue Ming thought about Chen Xiang\u2019s sudden rush and how he killed the two black robe men instantly. One could not help but feel chills run down their spine.They respected Chen Xiang because although they were much older than him, he was still stronger than them.Chen Xiang nodded with a smile: \u201cI just broke through!\u201dChen released True Qi flames and incinerated the corpses. This made Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang slightly surprised. True Qi flames was an alchemical flame; this time, they understood why Chen Xiang had the courage to accept the challenge of the Yao family genius!Xue Zhilang had an ashamed look on his face as he spoke, \u201cGreat brother Chen, I really did not think that you had concealed your strength all this time. Before I used to always looked down upon you; please forgive me!\u201dChen Xiang shook his head and said with a smile, \u201cNo problem, after all, strength comes first in this world. Right, is Xianxian coming to attend the banquet?\u201dXue Ming smiled and said, \u201cShe is the cause of the challenge between you and Yao family genius, how can she not come? No wonder this little girl only has great brother Chen in her heart and so much confidence in her choice.\u201dChen Xiang was speechless; he did not think that Xue Xianxian would truly pa.s.s on his challenge to the Yao family genius. Initially, he had indeed said it, but he had not thought that it would arrive this quickly.\u201cGreat brother Chen, that Yao family genius is very cunning. Although you are strong, the challenge is issued by him, so he will definitely compete in alchemy. His strength is probably also not weak; it has always been a mystery.\u201d Xue Ming said.Xue Zhilang nodded and added, \u201cI\u2019ve seen that guy, he is very arrogant. Previously he was invited to our Xue family, and he was already looking at little sister Xianxian and did not paid any attention to other people. However, his alchemy is splendid, thus the patriarch and elders endured him. Therefore, they want to match Xianxian and that guy in a marriage.\u201dChen Xiang had already heard about the Yao family genius. He was known to be very arrogant and proud, but many people thought it was natural considering he was one of the youngest alchemists.In front was the hustling and bustling Wohu City, Chen Xiang and Xue Ming noticed in the distance a team of horses gradually moving towards Wohu City. This team of horses and carriages was very grand, a total of five luxurious horse carriages, and each was being towed by eight steeds, but one carriage team had a man riding a horse who looked imposing and cold. His whole face teemed with Slaughter Qi, and with one look one could easily tell that he was a bodyguard.\u201cYes, Yao family members are really extraordinary!\u201d Chen Xiang said as he saw the big \u2018Yao\u2019 symbol on the horse carriage while those bodyguard\u2019s luxurious clothing also had the \u2018Yao\u2019 insignia on it. The Yao family style had always been high-profile.\u201cYou three, quickly report your name! Otherwise, we will deal with you as murderers.\u201d Suddenly a fierce shout came from the carriage team.This made Chen Xiang and Xue Ming unpleased. At that instant, just after their reply, a long two-edged sword came like an arrow out of the blue. On top of it, vigorous True Qi was seen, and it was flying precisely towards Chen Xiang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Martial Arts SectChen Xiang quickly took a few steps, his hand similar to a dragon\u2019s claw. It shoot out like lightning, firmly grasped the flying sword, and suddenly a powerful Qi exploded. While blocking the True Qi from the sword, Chen Xiang\u2019s arm was the only thing that slightly moved. He stood firmly and steadily like a mountain.Chen Xiang coldly said, \u201cI am Chen Xiang, a Chen Family member! Who are you? Quickly report your name or else I will treat you as killers!This declaration made Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang\u2019s hearts tremble. Chen Xiang was clearly being provocative towards the Yao Family carriage. It should be known that the Yao Family had sent many experts to protect their family genius. Just that flying sword alone was enough to make their guts tighten. If it were them standing there instead of Chen Xiang, they would certainly not be able to block that sword.\u201cBrother Xiang!\u201d During the silence between both sides, a sweet and gentle shout came from inside the carriage. Suddenly a slender silhouette came flying out with staggering speed. Without good eyesight, one simply would not be able to catch the person's\u2019 appearance.However, Chen Xiang could clearly tell that it was Xue Xianxian. Her Qing Gong had reached a high degree of proficiency. Even Chen Xiang could not help but gasp in surprise.[TLN: Qing gong Chinese martial technique for dodging and movement]Xue Xianxian\u2019s movement seemed like she was only skimming the ground. In one breath she treaded a hundred feet and arrived in front of Chen Xiang and the others. With a charming smile she said, \u201cXiao Qi, Xiao Ba, you are also here!\u201dXue Ming and Xue Zhilan both snorted, as Xue Ming said \u201cLittle girl, you should not call us like that in front of outsiders. Otherwise, how are we supposed to show our faces in public?\u201dXue Xianxian stuck her tongue out and then laughed tenderly, revealing two little dimples on her sweet and tender cheeks. It was a beautiful and heartrending expression.Chen Xiang couldn\u2019t help but squeeze Xue Xianxian\u2019s beautiful face and with a laugh said, \u201cHow can you be together with your husband\u2019s enemies? Just now, I was almost killed by that group of people.\u201dXue Xianxian furrowed her nose, laughing softly: \u201cI know Brother Xiang is very formidable, that sword was thrown by a Yao Family elder.\u201dChen Xiang recalled that the previous True Qi explosion was indeed quite frightening. It\u2019s power was at least in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. However, he practiced all five elements of True Qi so he could easily best it.The Yao Family\u2019s carriage stopped as several people stepped down from the horse carriage. It seemed like they were waiting for Chen Xiang to step aside.\u201cBrother Xiang, we should move.\u201d Xue Xianxian softly said.\u201cNo! It is not necessary.\u201d Chen Xiang looked coldly at the carriage team while remembering the ruthlessly thrown sword, and in his heart he was furious. That was because if it were an ordinary person, then they would have died unjustly.\u201cChen Family junior, come and salute the Yao Family Elder!\u201d A person waiting near the carriage shouted.\u201cI\u2019m not going to salute someone who just tried to kill me! Furthermore, there is not a single rule in my Chen Family which directs me to salute a Yao Family Elder!\u201d Chen Xiang replied coldly.Xue Ming and Xue Zhiliang suddenly admired Chen Xiang. He dared not only to contradict a Yao Family member, but did so in the presence of a Yao Family Elder.\u201cHumph, a good for nothing showing arrogance. We will continue on our way.\u201d Ironically, a voice full of arrogance was heard. It sounded very weak, yet still reached Chen Xiang\u2019s ear, which showed that this man\u2019s strength was quite good. After all, they were separated by at least one hundred feet.Xue Xianxian\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled. While softly snorting, she held onto Chen Xiang\u2019s arm and whispered \u201cDon\u2019t mind him!\u201dChen Xiang sneered, he tightly gripped the sword that was thrown just a moment ago and poured his True Qi into it before throwing the sword towards that distant carriage team. Azure True Qi enveloped the sword. It flew and pierced the middle carriage wheel while discharging an azure light, which was followed by an explosion that shattered the whole wheel. But since the luxurious carriage had four wheels, it remained stable.Xue Ming, Xue Zhilang and Xue Xianxian were dumbfounded! They did not expect Chen Xiang to repeatedly provoke the Yao Family members! They also felt extremely shocked regarding the sword throw from Chen Xiang. The formidable strength put into it was actually comparable with the sword that was formerly thrown by the Yao Family Elder a moment earlier!\u201cSorry. I just returned the sword yet no one was there to receive it.\u201d Chen Xiang faintly said. However, his voice was transmitted in all four directions and was filled with provocation.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Yao Tianhua angrily shouted, yet he did not follow suit. It seemed as if he was being blocked.The carriage team continued onward as if nothing had happened.\u201cMy father is still inside the carriage, I have to accompany him. I probably won\u2019t have the opportunity to stay beside him in the future.\u201d Xue Xianxian said with a distressed tone. Her beautiful face revealed a somewhat anxious expression.Chen Xiang caressed her hair while softly speaking, \u201cGo!\u201dXue Xianxian dashed away. Chen Xiang thoughtfully looked at her departing back and asked, \u201cWhy would she not have the opportunity to accompany her father in the future?\u201dXue Ming spoke with a furrowed brow \u201cBig brother Chen, have you heard about those Martial Art Sects inside the Immortal Mountains? This little girl will probably be fancied by those Martial Art Sects and enroll in one of them.\u201dThe number of powerful martial experts in the sects were as plentiful as the clouds in the sky. Many martial artists aspired their whole life to go there, but the best time to go would be during childhood.\u201cIf you want to enter those sects, it\u2019s best to apply after advancing to the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, otherwise you would not be able to properly accompany her.\u201d Su Meiyao suddenly said.Chen Xiang had a strong desire to enter those sects. After all, once he was there, he would be able to experience the strength of much more formidable martial artists. The Spirit Qi was also rich there which would allow him to display the full potential of his Yin and Yang Divine Vein.Chen Xiang, with Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang entered Wohu City. The Xue Family had some shops inside, so they turned down Chen Xiang\u2019s invitation to accompany him into the Chen Family villa.The Chen Family villa was quite lively inside. There were only three days until the banquet. Chen Xiang quickly greeted his father before returning to his own residence.\u201cMy current cultivation is at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. I think I can now start to refine Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans!\u201d Chen Xiang looked at the two beautiful girls who were drinking fragrant tea.Bai Youyou said, \u201cAlthough I am not an alchemist, I know that the materials required to refine Mortal Level Dans are very expensive. If you want to refine them, you also need to spend a large amount of spirit coins.\u201dSu Meiyao lightly sipped the tea with a smile, saying, \u201cThat is not a problem. Don\u2019t you have the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s, and the Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s? If these two spirit herbs were sold, that would be enough for the supply cost.\u201dChen Xiang had obviously not forgotten that he had these two precious spirit herbs. He smiled and asked \u201cElder Sisters, don't you have any treasuries with you? Currently, I do not have an suitable weapons on me.\u201dSu Meiyao sighed \u201cMy magic storage weapon was taken away by the enemy. Fortunately I was able to conceal one storage ring, but it only has some clothes inside, nothing more.\u201dWhile speaking on this matter, Bai Youyou\u2019s elegant and beautiful face was filled with anger as she accidently crushed the teacup. Chen Xiang could easily tell that there was a lot of good things inside that magical storage weapon.\u201cYou practice the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols]. The most suitable weapons for you to use are the Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons, but these are not easy to find, because each one is a Divine Weapon!\u201d Su Meiyao\u2019s words made Chen Xiang feel slightly excited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: First ConfrontationDivine Weapons? Weapons used by G.o.ds? Wouldn\u2019t it clearly be very powerful? Furthermore, there were even four in total! But listening to the previous statements, these Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons were extremely special and even ethereal.Bai Youyou said \u201cThese Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons were born with the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols.] Our teacher only got the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] while the actual Divine Weapons were lost with no trace. It is said that only someone who practices the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] can even hope to gain the recognition of the Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons!\u201dSu Meiyao spread her hands and said, \u201cAlthough I practice the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols], I have no intention of ever finding those Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons. I\u2019m simply not interested.Chen Xiang and the two girls chatted for quite some time. From these discussions, he learned a lot about the world of martial arts.Chen Xiang took ten thousand spirit coins from Chen Tianhu and arrived in a hurry at Spirit Dan Hall. He wanted to seize the time to refine a Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dan. This was not only to defeat the Yao Family genius, but also to help him quickly elevate his strength.\u201cWhat, the price was actually raised by three fold!\u201d Chen Xiang standing near the counter knitted his eyebrows together while looking at the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord.The Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord caressed his beard and said \u201cThis is the stated price. If you have any questions, you can ask the owner.\u201dSpirit Dan Hall\u2019s owner! This was the first time Chen Xiang even heard of someone like him. In the past, was it not what the Hall Lord said that counted?\u201cStarting today, as long as a Chen Family member is the one to buy any dans, it will be five times the price.\u201d At this time, an arrogant voice was heard. Chen Xiang knew that this voice belonged to Yao Tianhua.The Spirit Dan Hall was unexpectedly purchased by the Yao Family!The Spirit Dan Hall suddenly became quiet. Everyone was silently looking at the teenager who was walking down the stairs. He was quite handsome with fair skin. He wore luxurious golden attire and behind him were two old men with sharp gazes. His pair of eyes were full of pride. Glancing at everyone, his line of sight finally stopped to rest on Chen Xiang.This teenager was the Yao Family genius, Yao Tianhua!Inside Wohu City, dans were only sold at\u2026 Spirit Dan Hall. They had the final say on their prices, buying them or not was all up to the individual. Now that Spirit Dan Hall was controlled by the Yao Family, the jealousy and hatred of Yao Tianhua seeped towards Chen Xiang and definitely played a part in the new att.i.tude towards the Chen Family.\u201cYou are buying the herbs to refine a Baptising Marrow Dan. Moreover, the seedlings. What, are you going to refine them?\u201d Yao Tianhu said with a face full of disdain.\u201cSo what? Could it be in this world you are the only one who can become an alchemist?\u201d Chen Xiang sneered.\u201cI heard that you can release decent True Qi flames, but that doesn\u2019t mean you could use them for alchemy, for alchemy is awfully picky when it comes to flames! If a poor ruffian like you could refine pills then the world would not have so little alchemists.\u201d Yao Tianhu sneered in reply.In Chen Xiang\u2019s mind flashed one thought, he just thought of an ingenious plan. While laughing he said \u201cYao Family genius, this poor ruffian does indeed, truly understand alchemy. How about we make a bet, well a.s.suming you dare to bet with me that is.\u201dYao Tianhu suddenly laughed. \u201cYou\u2026 understand alchemy? You should not be refining dans through bragging. Good, good, good! What do you want to be? I will accompany you until the end!\u201dLooking at the fish that just took the bait, Chen Xiang felt happy in his heart as he took out a blood red spirit gra.s.s. This spirit gra.s.s is around the size of a plate and released a bizarre kind of smell. This was the Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s that he won from Chen Haohai.After this Blood Spirit Gra.s.s was put forth, everyone in Spirit Dan Hall could not help but change their expression. Even Yao Tianhua\u2019s face was filled with surprise. He was a Yao Family junior and could with one glance recognize that this Blood Spirit Gra.s.s was at least a thousand years old. This was a very expensive spirit herb, and as a result had no set market price.\u201cI would like to bet this Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, Can this young master of the Yao Family afford to bet with me?\u201d Chen Xiang said with a faint smile, \u201cAs long as I can refine a pill, I win. Opposingly, if I am not able to refine one, I lose. Simple as that, how is it? Do you dare to bet with me?\u201dLooking at Chen Xiang\u2019s appearance, it was as if bringing out the incomparably precious Thousand Year Old Spirit Gra.s.s was simply not valuable based on how casually he brought it out.Yao Tianhua had a very arrogant nature, being extremely concerned about face. In any case, he would definitely not reject the bet, but the betting stakes were simply too high this time. Although he was the Yao Family genius and carried along a large amount of money, but he was still unable to compare it with this Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.Chen Xiang actually carried around a Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s. This made many people hold him in high esteem. No one even dared to have any thought of robbing him. After all, in Wohu City, the Chen Family was very respected.Currently, Chen Xiang\u2019s father was the Chen Family Patriarch. Chen Xiang\u2019s status could only be imagined by looking at the Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.After seeing Yao Tianhua\u2019s complexion become extremely ugly, Chen Xiang felt good inside his heart. He pointed at the top of a small piece of the Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s and said \u201cYoung Master Yao has only come to Wohu City for the first time, so you didn\u2019t know I was just joking with you. Let\u2019s bet this small piece. If I win, you just have to give me three sets of mature herbs required to refine a Baptising Marrow Dan.A fingernail size section of that Blood Spirit Gra.s.s was more than enough to exchange for three sets of [Baptising Marrow Dan] ingredients. Yao Tianhua\u2019s complexion became a lot better as he heaves a heavy sigh of relief in his heart, replying \u201cNo problem, let\u2019s begin!\u201dAfter Chen Xiang retrieved the Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, he immediately took out his inferior alchemy furnace and let the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord examine it. After confirming there was no issues with the furnace, Chen Xiang took out some herbs and began to process them.At this time, everyone was intently watching Chen Xiang. Everyone who came here, more or less, yearned to become an alchemist, and actually witnessing the process of alchemy was a somewhat rare occasion for them. No one was against watching the various processes of alchemy, not to mention if it was a teenager that was the one doing it!True Qi flames poured out from Chen Xiang. The Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s lord\u2019s old face was filled with regret from Chen Xiang refusal to become his apprentice. Upon seeing the flames, he knew that this was the flame best suited for alchemy. After seeing the flames, Yao Tianhua could not help but frown as his complexion became very grim. He cursed in his heart \u201cd.a.m.n brat, he has been hiding his abilities well!\u201dWatching Chen Xiang\u2019s skilled motions and calm look, Yao Tianhu secretly gritted his teeth. He had determined that Chen Xiang had a certain amount of experience in regards to alchemy, furthermore it was no worse than his!Chen Xiang was definitely the most adept in refining a Quenching Body Dan. This pill was not only easy to refine, but required very little herbs. If one also had good control of their flames, they could refine many pills at once.When the crowd witnessed the relaxed expression on Chen Xiang's face, they were amazed. They had never seen someone refining dans so leisurely before. Unknowingly, an hour pa.s.sed by. After watching Chen Xiang\u2019s slightly serious complexion vanish, everyone knew that Chen Xiang had pa.s.sed the most crucial step of refinement.\u201cDone!\u201d Chen Xiang opened the lid of his alchemy furnace. Overflowing herbal fragrance drifted inside the hall. Everyone came and crowded around the furnace while staring inside. They all saw white mist slowly winding around five snow white pills.The crowd sucked in a deep breath, Chen Xiang had actually refined the Quenching Body Dan!The Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord\u2019s face froze. Seeing those five Quenching Body Dans in front of him was hard to believe. He was also an alchemist so he was able to clearly distinguish the quality of these Quenching Body Dans from their color and aroma. Yet because it was of a superior quality and refined in only a short period of time, furthermore from this inferior quality alchemy furnace, most people could not accept the fact that this was refined by a sixteen year old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Baptizing Marrow DanYao Tianhu\u2019s fair and handsome face started to turn ugly. His face muscles were slightly twitching. He was also chocked by Chen Xiang\u2019s alchemy technique. He had not thought that there was another young alchemist in this world that was on par with him!Chen Xiang placed the five [Quenching Body Dans] on his palm. Like eating candies, he popped them into his mouth, while smiling he said to Yao Tianhua \u201cNow, can you please give me those herbs for the [Baptizing Marrow Dan]?\u201dWatching Chen Xiang causally eating the freshly refined [Quenching Body Dans], the corners of everyone\u2019s mouth started twitching as they cursed Chen Xiang\u2019s prodigal skills. They wish they could ruthlessly trample him with their feet. Treating dans like snacks dealt an extremely heavy blow to them. Do all alchemists usually treat dans like candies!?Chen Xiang placed the five Quenching body dan on his palm. Like eating candies, he puts them in his mouth, and while smiling, he said to Yao Tianhua: \u201cNow you can give me those herbs for Baptizing marrow dan.\u201dSpirit Dan Hall\u2019s lord\u2019s two hands were s.h.i.+vering as he gave three sets of herbs to Chen Xiang. Wearing a look of surprise, he asked \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to try and refine a [Baptizing Marrow Dan] are you?Chen Xiang scratched his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything, and they\u2019re not always bad things. Your Spirit Dan Hall is now selling these dans at such an expensive price, so I can only resort to refining my own dans.\u201dChen Xiang received the herbs and turned around to leave. He turned his head back when he reached the door and said to Yao Tianhua. \u201cYoung Master Yao, a few days later the time of our alchemy compet.i.tion will arrive! At that time, I hope that you will be able to raise the gambling stakes and actually bet with me! Since it is a compet.i.tion, it should have a little more flare and fun. At that time, I will also raise the stakes. If you are unable to match them, you don\u2019t need to show up and compete with me.\u201dChen Xiang left with his mischievous words residing in the hall. Everyone inside Spirit Dan Hall suddenly began discussing about his terms. A Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s as a bet was able to scare even heaven, much less man, and he still wanted to raise the bet![TLN: Too exaggerating :)]Yao Tianhua coldly snorted with anger before he headed upstairs.Inside Spirit Dan Hall, it\u2019s lord murmured, \u201cImpossible. He is only sixteen years old. It would be impossible for him to refine a [Baptizing Marrow Dan]...\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s mood was extremely good from getting the three sets of [Baptizing Marrow Dan] ingredients for free. Soon he would be able to refine the [Baptizing Marrow Dan].\u201cLittle Devil, do not turn the boat in a trench. It\u2019s better to be careful!\u201d Su Meiyao reminded him.\u201cCompared to other things, alchemy is really boring! You should just go and chop him up into pieces.\u201dBai Youyou\u2019s chilling voice came. Hearing this statement, Chen Xiang could not help but s.h.i.+ver. He knew that Bai Youyou was a peerless she-devil lord that was practicing Devil Exercises. Suddenly he doesn\u2019t want to practice Bai Youyou\u2019s Devil Exercies anymore.Chen Xiang returned to the Chen Family Villa. He inquired Chen Tianhu and learned that both Xue Xianxian and her father were staying as a guest in the City Lord\u2019s Villa. Furthermore, many other families from Wohu City were frequently paying them a visit. It must be known that Xue Xianxian\u2019s father was someone with many connections.Chen Xiang arrived at the secret underground stone room. To refine the [Baptizing Marrow Dan] he first needed to concentrate and could not be bothered.Opening the package, Su Meiyao fiddled with the herbs in her exuberant smooth fingers and nodded with satisfaction. \u201cFifty year old Blood Ginseng, Fifty year old Spirit Leaf Gra.s.s, Profound Elemental Fruit, and Yang Fire Flower. The quality of these four herbs are pretty good. As for the rest of them, they are of ordinary quality but would not affect the refinement of the [Baptizing Marrow Dan]Chen Xiang picked up a white fruit that was the size of a walnut and picked up a small flower that resembled a sunflower. These were the Profound Elemental Fruit and Yang Fire Flower respectively. Thier prices were very expensive as they took dozens of years to mature.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou did not want to stay all day inside the ring, so whenever they got the chance they would come out. At the same time, they often chatted with Chen Xiang which helped keeping them from feeling too bored.Chen Xiang also liked it when both stunning beauties would emerge from time to time. After all, they were very beautiful and their just appearances would make people feel pleasant and happy. Accompanying these two beauties was a very wonderful opportunity.\u201cSister Meiyao, if I use the [Dragon Saliva Exercise] to mature the herbs for the [Baptizing Marrow Dan], how long do you think it would take?\u201d asked Chen Xiang. He knew that the herbs for the [Baptizing Marrow Dan] required them to be at least dozens of years old.Su Meiyao rolled her pretty eyes and said, \u201cIt will probably take ten days! You are now at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, you can now use more of the [Dragon Saliva Exercise]\u2019s abilities.\u201dOnly ten days to mature spirit herbs by dozens of years! This made Chen Xiang pretty surprised.Su Meiyao said \u201cBegin refining now. While refining the [Baptizing Marrow Dan], you need to pay attention to two main points! First, because more herbs are required to make the dan and each herb has different levels of flame resistance, you need to control your flames extremely accurately to make sure you don\u2019t burn some of the auxiliary herbs! Second, when it becomes time to solidify and congeal the pill, you need to make sure you have comprehended the essence of the pill at that time.\u201dChen Xiang tried to remember each and every word. Then he turned towards the not so far elegant beauty, asking,\u201dSister Youyou, can you please return to the inside of the ring? The Cold Qi emitted from your body will affect my control over my flames...\u201dBai Youyou\u2019s complexion immediately turned even more cold, causing Chen Xiang to hastily say \u201cSister Youyou\u2026 you are extremely beautiful. If it wasn\u2019t a last resort, there would be no way I would want a stunning beauty like you to return to the inside of a ring!\u201dSu Meiyao heard this and laughed over and over. \u201cBeautiful Senior Sister, don\u2019t scare this little guy. Let him refine his dan in peace.\u201dA humph sound could be heard from Bai Youyou before she returned to the ring.Chen Xiang started to refine the [Baptizing Marrow Dan], which is a Middle Grade Mortal Level Dan. One pill could be sold for five thousand spirit coins. Since Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s prices were now increased, it could probably be sold for ten thousand spirit coins which was equivalent to one million small spirit coins!After placing the herbs inside the furnace, Chen Xiang released his flames, simultaneously controlling the flames and temperature inside the alchemy furnace. The temperature of each region varied slightly in order to bake those herbs at the optimal temperature and completely release their respective Spirit Qi.The herbs required for the [Baptizing Marrow Dan] were not easy to use. Chen Xiang spent more than one hour before he could grasp the characteristics of each of the herbs and identify their degree of fire resistance. At this time, a colorful Spirit Qi was drifting inside the furnace. This Spirit Qi was released by those Spirit Herbs during their baking through the True Flames. These were the main ingredients in the creation of spirit dans.The herbs were slowly transforming into herbal powder. Chen Xiang\u2019s divine sense was slowly wrapping around the herbal powder. At this moment, as long as this herbal powder and the released Herbal Qi were fused, he would be able to successful congeal the dan.Everything started off well, but at the final step Chen Xiang was sweating. This Herbal Qi was very brutal in nature, making it very difficult to fuse different types of them together.\u201cNo wonder divine sense is a requirement before refining the [Baptizing Marrow Dan]. These spirit herb\u2019s Herbal Qi are very difficult to control!\u201d Chen Xiang thought while adhering. He then concentrated his spirit and released even more divine sense, forcing these colorful Herbal Qis to fuse together. At least they started to turn into a Black Spirit Qi and started to fuse with the grey herbal powder.\u201cI must be successful and endure!\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s heart only had this one thought. The herbal powder and Herbal Qi were gradually fusing, but he felt as if his Divine Sense was not powerful enough to successfully congeal them into pills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: A Prodigious TalentChen Xiang watched as the herbal powders mixed and were about to congeal into a dan.Bang!A horrid sound spread through the air and a rapid Qi wave burst out from the alchemic furnace. Cheng Xiang quickly retreated and glared at the fallen lid with a stunned face and sweat dripping down his back.\u201cThat d.a.m.n furnace exploded!\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Su Meiyao asked with a slight disregard as she combed her hair.\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d replied Chen Xiang, trying to catch his breath. When he had somewhat calmed down, he inspected his alchemic furnace to check for any damages. Surprisingly, it was fine.Su Meiyao\u2019s lips spread into a slight smile as said encouragingly, \u201cThen continue. It\u2019s common for such a thing to happen.\u201dSeeing Su Meiyao\u2019s fascinating and charming smile, the sense of failure in Chen Xiang's mind was swept away. Having calmed down, he took a few moments of rest and then brought out more herbs.One, two, and three hours pa.s.sed, and once again Chen Xiang arrived at the last step only to fail. Fortunately, the furnace had not exploded like the last time.Chen Xiang sighed and said, \u201cThis is too difficult to refine. There are only one set of herbs remaining which means that I only have one more chance left to succeed.\u201dLooking at the sweat on Chen Xiang\u2019s furrowed face, Su Meiyao came up to him. With a damp towel, she wiped it off and said, \u201cLittle one, this sister here, during her time of refining the Baptizing marrow Dan exploded several alchemic furnaces. You are doing well at the rate you\u2019re going. According to my estimation, for you to be successful, it would probably take you at least another twenty more tries.\u201dStaring into Su Meiyao\u2019s bewitching eyes, Chen Xiang became fl.u.s.tered. The allure of her beauty made his heart throb, and at that moment, his mind could not help but think of her naked image burned in his mind.\u201cWhat?! Twenty times? That won\u2019t do. I do not have that much money to spend,\u201c Cheng Xiang said. He shook his head, trying to stay focused and clear those disturbing images floating in his mind.As if reading Chen Xiang\u2019s mind, Su Meiyao played cutely and shook her bosom a little. \u201cLittle guy, you going off into wild flights of fantasy has nothing to do with me, but if your thoughts wander towards senior sister, you will probably be out of luck.\u201dA sudden thought of an elegant and beautiful Bai Youyou, filled with a bloodthirsty and cruel Qi, one wrought of slaughter, came to Chen Xiang\u2019s mind, and he laughed. He felt silly and did not dare to take another glance at the giggling soft bosom of Su Meiyao again.A proud smile bloomed on Su Meiyao's face.After that, Cheng Xiang took more than an hour of rest. In the meantime, he listened to Su Meiyao\u2019s narration of her experience in refining the Baptizing Marrow Dan. When Cheng Xiang had fully rested, he once again attempted to refine it, only, this time, it was twice as quick. After about an hour and a half, he was at the last stage of solidifying the dan.Su Meiyao\u2019s eyes glittered as she watched. In her opinion, it would have been impossible for Chen Xiang to refine the Baptizing Marrow Dan so quickly, but it was successful. Thus, Su Meiyao could not help but feel admiration towards the boy\u2019s alchemic talent.At that moment, she could see an amazing and diverse future for Chen Xiang, more than she had ever expected to live herself.\u201cSenior sister, our Divine Veins were not pa.s.sed on to the wrong person! This man has not disappointed us,\u201d Su Meiyao transmitted to Bai Youyou inside of the ring using her divine sense.\u201cThis is merely better than the most.\u201d Bai Youyou said in a cold voice, but Su Meiyao could sense a trace of a rare smile.A moment later, Chen Xiang opened his eyes. Filled with excitement, he propped the lid of the furnace open. After seeing what\u2019s inside, he looked towards Su Meiyao in excitement. \u201cSister Meiyao, I did it! I refined the Baptizing Marrow Dan!\u201dBai Youyou came out from inside the ring. At that moment, like Su Meiyao, her eyes gleamed with surprise and joy. They had pinned all of their hopes on Chen Xiang, and after seeing his level of inherent talent, they couldn\u2019t help but be happy.Ordinarily, three Baptizing Marrow Dans could be refined at the same time. Chen Xiang was able only able to refine two dans, but it had taken him only a day to successfully refine them!Such a thing can only be done by someone of great talent. Chen Xiang\u2019s actions showed he not only had the ability, but an unusual perception that could detect the subtle changes during the dan congealing process.After a few tries, with such a perception, Chen Xiang was able to become attuned with what was necessary to succeed.Su Meiyao ruffled Chen Xiang\u2019s hair, her alluring eyes locked onto him as she smiled and said, \u201cGood brat, you did not disappoint me!\u201dHearing Su Meiyao, Bai Youyou nodded in agreement. The cold look in her eyes had softened considerably.Watching the two stunning beauties praising him, and with such closeness, Chen Xiang\u2019s heart was filled with pride. But although he was successful this time, it did not mean that he would succeed every time.Not allowing his pride to dampen his resolution, he went to refine a few more dans before he left the underground private room.Just as he left, a girl wearing a purple skirt, sitting in the small hall, came into his view.She had a n.o.ble air about her and looked absolutely stunning. For a moment, Chen Xiang\u2019s mind went blank as he asked in a confused voice, \u201cXianxian, why are you here?\u201dXue Xianxian looked at Chen Xiang and said, \u201cWhat? Can't I come to find you? Well, you are an adult. So you should be the one to look after me, right? Why am I the one who is always coming for you? Hmph! After all, this will just make me a joke in front of others.\u201dChen Xiang scratched his head in embarra.s.sment. He had honestly wanted to go to find Xue Xianxian, but he first wanted to practice his alchemy. He sauntered to Xue Xianxian and brushed his hand against her face. The girl\u2019s face turned bright red as she blushed.\u201cXue Xianxian, I\u2019m truly sorry. I have been busy with my alchemy. Please, take this as my apology.\u201d Chen Xiang took out a small box containing two black dans. There were the same Baptizing Marrow Dan dans he had just refined!Xue Xianxian opened the box and said with a soft shout, \u201cBaptizing Marrow Dan! Did Xiao Xiang brother refine it?\u201dChen Xiang smiled and said, \u201cI only managed to refine them due to luck. I do not have any more raw materials now, and was just preparing to buy more, but the Spirit Dan Hall now belongs to the Yao family. If I were to buy from them, I would have to pay several times that of the market price\u2026 Xianxian can you help me buy some of these herbs?\u201dXue Xianxian bent her head in serious thought. Her demeanor and her face became stern as she said in a serious voice, \u201cCertainty, but Xiao Xiang brother, you can refine Baptizing Marrow Dan at this age. This is simply too astonis.h.i.+ng!\u201dXue Xianxian then brought her voice level to a whisper and continued, \u201cXiao Xiang brother, you can later enter those martial arts sects and can most likely reach the pinnacle of martial arts.\u201dChen Xiang nodded and said, \u201cI plan to, but presently I do not have enough strength. Xianxian, did some sect come to recruit you?\u201dThe girl sighed and answered, \u201cIt is not a sect, but a person. She has received our Xue family\u2019s grace, and she fancies me and wants me to be her apprentice. She seems to be a member of some martial arts sect, but she did not specifically mention about its ident.i.ty.\u201d\u201cI will follow her, and soon.......\u201d Xue Xianxian stopped herself in dismay.\u201cIt does not matter. It is the goal of every martial artist, and sooner or later, I will go as well,\u201d said Chen Xiang as he took out a ten thousand spirit coin bill and gave it to Xue Xianxian.Taking the bill from Chen Xiang, Xue Xianxian said, \u201cBaptizing Marrow Dan is of no use to me now so I will help you sell it in exchange for the herbs you need Xiao Xiang brother. Wait for me; I will be back quickly.\"After Xue Xianxian left, Chen Xiang hurriedly took a bath. Just as he finished, Xue Xianxian returned with a mature and charming white-robed lady with her.If Chen Xiang had previously not encountered Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao, he would have been easily smitten by the lady.This middle-aged beauty coming with Xue Xianxian had an oval face that was clear of any makeup. Her skin was pale and tender, and unexpectedly, she was in no way inferior to Xue Xianxian! With a smile on her face, she looked at Chen Xiang with her phoenix-like eyes, and her graceful figure exuded an imposing manner. Along with the power coursing in those eyes of hers, she could easily have been mistaken as an aloof G.o.ddess with an armageddon might.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Divine Weapons Heavenly Empire[TLN: Divine Weapons Heavenly Empire or Shen Bing Tian Empire (\u795e\u5175\u5929\u56fd)]The middle aged woman was slowly walking towards Chen Xiang. With every single step she took towards him, the pressure that descended upon Chen Xiang increased greatly. Although he had been somewhat bewildered by her beauty, that feeling was now firmly swept away. A cold sweat emerged on his skin and his limbs turned weak as his body became stiff. It was as if he had lost all his strength and was rendered unable to move. As the woman\u2019s eyes that resembled a phoenix landed on him, Chen Xiang felt as if he was stripped and bare in front of her. It was as if she could see right through him; his heart, his desires\u2026 his capabilities.It quickly dawned on Chen Xiang that this was a very formidable and capable woman. He felt that he needed to act fast, so he calmed his mind and operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and quickly covered his aura, concealing it within his Yin and Yang Divine Veins. He wanted to adhere to Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou\u2019s orders and make sure that no one found out anything about what he had or could do. Although this took quite a while to describe, it all happened in an instant.As the two finally entered the room Chen Xiang was in, the phoenix eyed woman\u2019s eyebrows became furrowed, as a trace of surprise flashed through her eyes. Upon entering, she noticed that Chen Xiang was calm and looked at her as he would any other woman. The phoenix eyed woman had always been aware of her own beauty and grace. She knew that the power she exuded accentuated her beauty and vice versa. She was even confident and prideful about it. Any vigorous and healthy teenager would have been instantly ensnared and enamoured with her charm and allure, or at least been affected by her presence. Yet after seeing Chen Xiang, a bud of uncertainty about her own beauty became planted deeply within her heart.\u201cXianxian, your fianc\u00e9 here is really capable. Much better than that sh**head genius from the Yao Family!\u201d The middle aged woman\u2019s voice was soft. It was a majestic and commanding tone. It could be seen that the woman was accustomed to giving out orders, and clearly expected those orders to be followed.Chen Xiang did not waste any time, he instantly cupped his hands in salute and said, \u201cJunior Chen Xiang greets senior\u2026 May I inquire if this senior is Xue Xianxian\u2019s master?\u201dThe woman smiled in reply. He became unable to say a single word in response to that charming smile, something which could seize the soul of any man. Chen Xiang quickly realized he had become fl.u.s.tered, but after seeing and meeting so many different kinds of people he was barely able to keep his mind calm. Chen Xiang was also startled at his power of self-control.\u201cYes, you can rest a.s.sured and leave your little wife to me!\u201d The middle aged woman\u2019s voice was gentle. Unlike before, the commanding tone had disappeared and was replaced with tenderness. Xue Xianxian sighed with relief. She had been worried over how her master and fianc\u00e9 would feel about each other. However, knowing that she and Chen Xiang were soon to part, an overwhelming and bitter sadness permeated throughout her heart. Nibbling her lips in distraught, Xue Xianxian took out a package of herbs and handed them to Chen Xiang.\u201cI must leave with master, but you must quickly come and look for me!\u201d mumbled Xue Xianxian while bowing.Chen Xiang had not expected that there time together would be so short. His heart was also filled with dismay. He cupped his future wife\u2019s face and said., \u201cBe happy, we will definitely be together. I will find you again.\u201dXue Xianxian\u2019s master harrumphed, \u201cBrat, you better have strength above the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm before you go off and look for those martial sects. You say you want to look for Xianxian? Then you should first start looking into me. After all, obtaining information about me shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Once that\u2019s done and you manage to find me, you\u2019ll be able to see her again.\u201dAfterwards the woman turned to Xue Xianxian. \u201cLittle girl, let\u2019s go. That brat is more formidable than you can imagine, don\u2019t worry about him, it\u2019s a waste of energy. \u201cBefore the woman departed,Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian embraced each other. The phoenix eyed woman then took Xue Xianxian away. Chen Xiang watched them soar through the sky as they flew towards the horizon, disappearing in a seconds notice.When Chen Xiang was sure that the middle aged woman was gone, he snorted, \u201cHumph! Pretending to be profound and mysterious. Not giving me any information to go off of and then having the gall to tell me to go look into her!? d.a.m.n IT! At least tell me your name!\u201d\u201cThat woman is very strong. She\u2019s known as the Empress of the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire. It is well known that the Divine Weapon of the Vermillion Bird, one of the Four Beast\u2019s Divine Weapons is in her hands. Having her recieve your little wife as an apprentice is a fortunate opportunity.\u201d said Su Meiyao.Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire? Chen Xiang had never heard of them. Just as he was about to ask more about this matter, Bai Youyou interrupted the thought. \u201cThat woman is very formidable and has a power similar to our own. She is, after all, one of the deans of the eight major Righteous Sects in the Chenwu Mainland. It\u2019s to be expected. However, I did not expect that she would actually come here to accept an apprentice.\u201dChen Xiang recalled that Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had previously mentioned the Chenwu mainland. It was one of the many large land ma.s.ses of the Mortal Martial World. Inside it were eight Righteous Sects, each with it\u2019s own dean as the rulers of the region they occupied.Those sects were at the pinnacle of strength and were the pillars of the mortal martial realm.\u201cThe Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire was originally just a singular sect but later developed into the nation it is now by relying upon their skills at refining formidable weapons! That woman just now is their empress.\u201d said Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang was happy knowing that Xue Xianxian\u2019s teacher was such a formidable figure. He felt more at ease. Although Chen Xiang felt somewhat lost with Xue Xianxian gone, he had convinced himself that this was the best for her. Taking the six set of herbs that Xue Xianxian had given him, he continued to refine more Baptizing Marrow Dans.Three days pa.s.sed.At this point in time, Chen Xiang had successfully refine the Baptizing Marrow Dan four times and only failed once. He was satisfied with the overall results, and today was the start of the Chen Family Patriarch banquet. Many families had been invited and each sent someone to represent them. Every partic.i.p.ant was looking forward to the compet.i.tion between Chen Xiang and Yao Tianhua.The Chen Family banquet brought together many different families. These people had not come just for the food, but for the compet.i.tion! The compet.i.tive spirit amongst the junior members was at a boiling point from the excitement!The banquet was held in a wide field at night. Several guests were bustling about, some sipped wine while other ordered off the menu. The entire dining experience was rich and vibrant.Some of the Patriarchs from various other families came, but more had not due to the relations.h.i.+p between them and the Chen Family being terribly poor. They sent representatives in their stead instead. Only the Patriarchs who were still in a good relations.h.i.+p with the Chen Family attended.Insides the wide field of the Chen Family villa, numerous members from the junior generations of various martial art families of the Southern Martial Empire had been gathered. Although these bouts between them were going to be grand and intense, the majority of the crowd\u2019s attention was gathered on a specific match, the one between Chen Xiang and Yao Tianhua.The news of Chen Xiang refining the Quenching Body Dan had spread out. Furthermore, tonight was the date of the alchemy compet.i.tion with Yao Tianhua. After learning about the skills of the two partic.i.p.ants, there was a huge betting pool which caused the attention put on this compet.i.tion to soar even higher.When the banquet had been held for about half of the night, one of the guests could not sit still and shouted, \u201cPatriarch Chen! At what time will the alchemy compet.i.tion between your son and the Yao Family start? We have all been patiently waiting for a long time. At the end of the day, the compet.i.tion between those two is much more interesting than anything else tonight!\u201d\u201cOriginally I had planned to first start off with the martial art contests to add some enthusiasm as well as bring up everyone\u2019s mood. However, seeing that everyone has waited for so long, let\u2019s begin right now! Let the two young men begin their contest!\u201d Chen Tianhu\u2019s voice boomed over the entire field as everything suddenly became quiet.In the middle of the courtyard, a large elevated stage was being built by a few old men. As the stage almost reached the end of its construction, Chen Xiang arrived.He wore black tights, a simple garb made for versatile movement. However, when compared to Chen Xiang, Yao Tianhua was simply eye catching. His luxurious gown shone with a golden aura with a sword sheathed at his waist, the hilt gleaming with studded gems. Yao Tianhua seemed like the son of the heavens. His posture, dress and demeanour all permeated arrogance. Even the expression on his face was overbearing and made many uncomfortable, or even unhappy.\u201cYao Tianhua, do you like our current stakes? Why not raise them for such a grand compet.i.tion!\u201d Chen Xiang said cooly.\u201cNo matter what your bet is, my Yao Family can afford to match it.\u201d Yao Tianhua said, his voice flat and cold.\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m just betting on my own behalf, not on the whole Chen Family\u2019s! I had not expected you, as a young and dignified alchemist, would need to rely on his entire family just to match my bet.\u201d Chen Xiang said with a smile.Yao Tianhua\u2019s facial expression contorted. He knew that without his family\u2019s support, he would be unable to match the bet of a Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.\u201cChen Family young master, please don\u2019t speak such nonsense. Tianhua is representing the whole Yao Family in this compet.i.tion, so it\u2019s no big deal getting their support. You are yourself, and he is himself.\u201d An old man immediately said, with an impatient tone. He was the Yao Family Elder who had come along with Yao Tianhua.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Please Verify It!Chen Xiang took out his Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gras and said \u201cThis is the Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s!\u201dEveryone had long since heard about Chen Xiang owning a Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, but now that it was presented in front of everyone, they were still inevitably surprised. After all, this was a world famous rare herb!\u201cOf course, if I only use this for the bet then maybe the Yao family will look down on me. So I will also add one half of a h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s!\u201d In Chen Xiang\u2019s hand appeared half a h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s. Although one half had been eaten by Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, the remaining half was still very precious.This time several old men desperately jumped on the stage, while Chen Tianhu and several Chen family elders also went on the stage. After all the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s was a legendary spirit herb.Suddenly the whole field was deadly silent, and everyone could see the black h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s, but they simply did not believe that so every one of those old men who knew about the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s jumped up to verify it. Even the Yao Family Elder came up to see the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s.\u201cYes, this is a h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s!\u201d Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord exclaimed loudly, his voice containing indescribable jealousy and envy, while those pair of old eyes frantically looked at the black half of the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s in the hands of Chen Xiang.Authenticated, the field suddenly burst into cries, and everyone was talking about Chen Xiang taking out half of a h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s and a Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s as the betting stakes. This bet was very large, and was something that any ordinary family simply could not afford.\u201cWhat are you going to bet?\u201d Chen Xiang looked at Yao Tianhua and the Elder.Yao Tianhua and the Elder\u2019s complexion were not looking good, and anyone who was proficient in alchemy would know that the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s was a Profound Level Spirit Herb. Spirit Level Spirit Herbs were already very rare and Profound Level was even more so, so they knew its value.\u201cThousand Year Beast Dan, and a 1000 Vein Fruit! What do you think?\u201d the Elder said.Only after the death of a wild beast who had a lived for more than a thousand years would leave behind a dan which is congealed out from its Yuan essence. This dan is the Thousand Year Beast Dan. If this dan were used in the refinement process, it would provide a large help, the 1000 Vein Fruit was also extremely valuable. It was a Profound Level Spirit Herb and apparently only grew once every one thousand years. Furthermore, on the peel of the fruit there were thousand veins and was a key ingredient in refining a Foundation Building Dan.The Yao Family\u2019s stakes were equally astonis.h.i.+ng, which once again surprised the entire crowd. Whoever won would absolutely reap giant profits!\u201cGood, agreed!\u201d said Chen Xiang.\u201cRegarding the rules, in most alchemy compet.i.tions, whoever has the fastest speed in refining the best dan will win.The quality of the dan can be judged by everybody present.\u201d the Yao Family Elder said.Chen Xiang did not have any opinions regarding this matter. Chen Tianhu patted his son\u2019s shoulders to show his encouragement. Chen Xiang and Yao Tianhu took out their respective alchemy furnaces to let some elders examine to avoid any cheating in the compet.i.tion.After the examination they all left the high stage and announced the start of the compet.i.tion. Chen Xiang quickly took out the herbs and placed them inside the alchemy furnace. Yao Tianhua was not able to clearly see what herbs Chen Xiang placed, and in his heart he was somewhat unhappy since he could not tell what dan Chen Xiang was refining.Nevertheless Yao Tianhua was still confident about his win because with his status of a Yao Family member, he could acquire very high-grade materials. In his opinion, when creating a dan of the same level, absolutely no one could refine a better quality dan than him.Looking at the glittering golden light from Yao Tianhua\u2019s alchemy furnace, Chen Xiang\u2019s heart was burning with jealousy. His poor alchemy furnace was much more inferior and many people a.s.sumed that he would lose just by looking at his furnace.\u201cWanting to do alchemy with a furnace like that is simply too much of a joke! It\u2019s even inferior when compared with the tripod furnace that we use for cooking soup in our family.\u201d One teenager laughed. Others soon burst into laughter after hearing the statement.Only the people with decent alchemy knowledge knew that alchemy was not determined by the furnace, but the individual performing the refinement process. If it was an alchemy grandmaster, even without an alchemy furnace they could perform alchemy and successfully refine dans.While Chen Xiang was refining the Baptizing Marrow Dan, he was also observing Yao Tianhua as he placed his spirit herbs in the furnace. Just by observing the herbs, he had determined Yao Tianhua was trying to refine a Low Grade Mortal Level Dan called a Spirit Yuan Dan, which provided a boost during cultivation. It could be called the most expensive Low Grade Mortal Level Dan, and its refinement was rather difficult. It was common for many people to refine this dan in alchemy compet.i.tions. It was also a test for alchemists to determine how well they grasped the basics of alchemy.Chen Xiang had already long before practiced refining that dan. However, the cost of refinement was rather high and was only slightly cheaper compared to the Baptizing Marrow Dan. Therefore it did not make much sense for Chen Xiang to refine that dan.Waiting for the outcome was rather tedious. Everyone was either eating, drinking or chatting while watching the two young alchemists on stage.In order to successfully refine the Baptizing Marrow Dan, Chen Xiang did not pursue speed but was instead cautiously refining.It took almost half an hour for Chen Xiang to completely transform all the spirit herbs into herbal powder which soon filled the alchemy furnace with colorful herbal Spirit Qi. Now he only had to fuse together the various herbal Spirit Qis, and then fuse together the completed herbal Spirit Qi with the herbal powder. This was the most crucial and nerve racking process, and if it was not done correctly, it would lead to the entire furnace exploding.Two hours pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye. Currently, Chen Xiang had a very serious facial expression and was sweating profusely. On the other hand, Yao Tianhua was much more relaxed and could even be described as idle. He occasionally took glances at Chen Xiang, seeing him in pain was very satisfying for Yao Tianhua. He could easily tell that Chen Xiang was at the most crucial step of refinement, furthermore he might easily make a mistake.\u201cDone! Five Spirit Yuan Dan!\u201d Yao Tianhua suddenly shouted. This put everyone into a momentary lapse of confusion, meanwhile Chen Xiang had yet to finish. Everyone looked at Chen Xiang, and seeing his serious expression a.s.sumed he had encountered some problems in the refining process.\u201cThe Yao Family genius really deserves his reputation! Not only did he refine five Spirit Yuan Dan in two hours, but this is also the best Low-Grade Mortal Level Dan! It seems that Chen Family brat is going to lose.\u201d One person said.\u201cI heard that refining a Spirit Yuan Dan is not easy, is that Chen family brat also refining the exact same dan? If so, he already lost and is behind in time by a great margin.\u201d Another person said.Everyone started discussing about Chen Xiang\u2019s apparent loss. After all, Chen Xiang had placed very huge betting stakes.Yao Tianhua was also waiting for Chen Xiang to finish. He could barely disguise his pleasure as he was certain Chen Xiang would lose and that he would soon win that Thousand Year Blood Spirit Gras along with the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s. With these two items, he would certainly become famous throughout the entire Southern Martial Empire.Chen Xian did not make them wait for too long. He took a long and deep breath before saying. \u201cWell, I\u2019m finally done!\u201dHearing Chen Xiang speak, the crowd quieted down, only to hear Yao Tianhua\u2019s ridicule, \u201cSo what? You still lost!\u201dChen Xiang faintly smiled as he wiped off the sweat on his forehead, saying \u201cI have refined three Baptizing Marrow Dan, please verify it!\u201dThree Baptizing Marrow Dan! This made the audience transfixed like wooden chickens. This was unbelievable, and everybody suspected they had problems with their hearing. Chen Xiang actually refined a Middle-Grade Mortal Level Baptizing Marrow Dan!? That was far more expensive than the Spirit Yuan Dan!\u201cIt\u2019s not possible! He\u2019s only sixteen years old\u2026 it\u2019s impossible for him to refine a Baptizing Marrow Dan!\u201d The Spirit Dan Hall\u2018s Lord, while strangely crying, rushed onto the high stage. Some other elders also flew onto the stage as well as Chen Tianhu who arrived by Chen Xiang\u2019s side.\u201cChen Xiang, now is not the time or place for a joke.\u201d Yao Tianhua could not believe that Chen Xiang had actually successfully refined a Baptizing Marrow Dan, and he wasn\u2019t alone. The majority of people present also could not believe it.Chen Xiang smiled and indifferently said again, \u201cPlease verify it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing FistThe two alchemy furnaces were simultaneously opened. Yao Tianhua\u2019s alchemy furnace contained five azure dans while in Chen Xiang\u2019s alchemy furnace there were three black dans.\u201cYao Tianhua has refined five Spirit Yuan Dan, meanwhile Chen Xiang has re...refined three Baptizing Marrow Dan!\u201d One of the Elders of the Chen Family shouted in a very excited voice. The Chen Family now had a supreme alchemy genius! As long as they were Chen Family members, everyone was obviously going to be extremely excited just like him.Yao Tianhua and the Yao family Elder saw those three black dans, and just from the aroma originating from the dan, they confirmed it really was the Baptizing Marrow Dan. However the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord still picked the up dan and carefully examined it.\u201cThis really is the Baptizing Marrow Dan and is also of such good quality! Honestly it is difficult for others to admit! One little boy is actually capable of refining this dan.\u201d Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord exclaimed again and again, his face full of a complex expression, and he suddenly felt that he had wasted his seventy-eighty years of life.The whole field surged with bursts of cries, and after the confirmation everyone was dumbfounded. They had witnessed the whole alchemy process, and Chen Xiang did not to do anything tricky and was actually able to refine the Middle-Grade Mortal Level Baptizing Marrow Dan.The matter of Chen Xiang having no Spiritual Veins had long been forgotten, and now in the heart of everyone, he was an alchemist with huge potential.Yao Tianhua\u2019s expression was similar to dying embers. The handsome face of his was full of anger, envy and ruthlessness. If possible, he just could not wait to kill Chen Xiang because him losing to Chen Xiang was just insulting.\u201cYou willingly took the bet. Now it\u2019s time to admit defeat! Take out your bet!\u201dChen Xiang had a faint smile on his face, but it seemed, through Yao Tianhua\u2019s eyes, like he was being contemptuous with a mocking smile, making Yao Tianhua furious inside his heart.The Yao Family\u2019s Elder\u2019s entire body was trembling. He was also furious from the loss because not only did their Yao Family lose a lot of precious materials, but they also lost their reputation. Their acclaimed Yao Family genius was inferior to a Chen Family member who did not even have Spirit Veins!The Thousand Year Beast Dan looked like an emerald egg, and inside flowed the Yuan essence of a thousand year old wild beast. The Thousand Vein Fruit was as big as an apple but very heavy, and holding it in his hands, Chen Xiang could feel the energy contained inside.Chen Xiang was very happy in his heart from obtaining these two precious materials. If he could refine these materials into dans, he would be able to elevate his strength very quickly.\u201cChen Xiang, let\u2019s compete in martial arts!\u201dYao Tianhua pulled out the double edged sword from his waist as killing intent emanated from his body.Chen Xiang could defeat a martial artist of the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, so naturally this challenge from Yao Tianhua did not hold any meaning. As such, the Chen Family members were all very relieved.Chen Tianhu said with a sigh, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be arrogant. Otherwise you are bound to suffer another loss.\u201dChen Tianhu was currently very excited. Not only could his son refine the Baptizing Marrow Dan but he had also earned two very precious alchemy ingredients.\u201cIf you want to fight, then let\u2019s fight. However, if you get injured don\u2019t blame me. After all, fists and kicks do not have eyes.\u201d Chen Xiang said lazily. By now, the Chen Family Elder and Chen Tianhu had already retreated to the side lines.But the Yao Family Elder was now a bit worried. From many years of experience, he could see that Chen Xiang was definitely out of the ordinary and definitely not the wimpy kid with no Spiritual Vein like the rumors suggested.\u201cTianhua, how confident are you about victory?\u201d the Yao Family Elder asked in a deep voice.\u201cI\u2019m 100% sure I will win. I\u2019m a Mortal Martial Realm Martial Artist of the 5th Level and practice many excellent martial skills!\u201dYao Tianhua glared with anger stricken eyes at Chen Xiang, he could not wait to kill him.\u201cGood, remember you are just simply exchanging pointers. You do not want to take his life, after all, we are inside the Chen Family\u2019s villa.\u201d the Yao Family also proceeded to retreat off the high stage.Chen Xiang felt that this situation was somewhat funny. Just a moment ago, everybody thought that he could not refine the Baptizing Marrow Dan and now they were once more making a.s.sumptions that he was weak.\u201cSince it is a compet.i.tion you proposed, how about we add a little bet to it?\u201d Chen Xiang asked with a smile.Seeing Yao Tianhua not reply, Chen Xiang knew that the Yao Family could not afford to bet again. Chen Xiang said with a smile, \u201cIf you win, how about you get to take back the Thousand Year Beast Dan and the Thousand Vein Fruit. But if you lose, then our Chen Family will get to take the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord. He will then become our Chen Family\u2019s alchemist and we also get to take half of the spirit herbs owned by Spirit Dan Hall! How about it?\u201dSpirit Dan Hall was currently the Yao Family\u2019s property. From this, it was certain the the Yao Family had already recruited the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord. Since the Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord had to be at least somewhat knowledgeable in alchemy, Chen Xiang wanted to win over this talented person to the Chen Family.\u201cNo problem! But the Spirit Dan Hall will still belong to our Yao Family.\u201d The Yao Family readily agreed without hesitation. In his opinion, it was just one alchemist and some cheap spirit herbs, the Yao Family had no shortage of this, not to mention Yao Tianhua was 100% sure of his win.Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s Lord could only sigh loudly. He was very unhappy at being treated as a betting stake, but he also felt there was no major problem in joining the Chen Family. Perhaps in the future he would have an opportunity to trade and gain the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s from Chen Xiang.\u201dCome on! Take out your weapon!\u201d Yao Tianhua coldly said while shaking his double-edged sword that was radiating with a cold and cruel aura.Chen Xiang shook his head in response and replied, \u201cI do not use weapons.\u201d\u201cThen do not blame me for being impolite!\u201d Yao Tianhua wielded his sword and with a steady step, stomped on the stage causing it to tremble. From this action of his, one could clearly see his attack was going to be violent and full of power.It was already late into the night, but no one felt the need to sleep. On the contrary, everyone was very energetic, since these two very talented young alchemists were going to compete in martial arts.The general impression of alchemists were that they were not very strong, but this line of thinking was dead wrong. In order to become an alchemist, one should first and foremost be able to control their True Qi freely. Their divine sense should be strong enough that they could arbitrarily manipulate their flames to respond to any sudden changes or danger during the refining process.They also needed to occasionally personally acquire rare herbs which was also very dangerous. Moreover alchemist had so many dans they could take, so their strength was in no way weak. It was just that most alchemists were protected at all times so there was usually no need for them to come out and personally fight.Looking at the sharp long sword that was stabbing towards him, Chen Xiang quickly took a step forward and punched out. Azure True Qi suddenly wrapped around his arm as it transformed into a tiger\u2019s head.\u201c[Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]! This child has actually entered into the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!\u201d Chen Tianhu shouted with surprise. The [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist] was originally a High-Grade Spirit Level Martial Skill. It was similar to a ferocious tiger pouncing onto its prey and was filled with the power of a True Qi explosion.As long as they were not blind, everyone could see that Chen Xiang had entered into the Divine Sense Stage. He could control True Qi externally and congeal it into a solid form by controlling his divine sense. Congealing a tiger\u2019s head could only be accomplished by Divine Sense Stage martial artists.Sixteen years old, and not only could he refine a Baptizing Marrow Dan, but he had also reached the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. This level of talent was an extreme rarity, at most only one in a thousand years. Only Xue Xianxian of the Xue Family could possibly hope to compare, there was a rumor that she had fought on par with a Xue Family Elder. Although it was only a rumor, many people believed it.The Elder\u2019s strength was over the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Xue Xianxian had fought with this Elder numerous times. Xue Xianxian was only around fourteen years old, yet she was already able to fight on par with an Elder. This degree of talent, perhaps only Chen Xiang could hope to match it.Chen Xiang\u2019s fists looked like an angry ferocious tiger, and the Azure True Qi shattered the atmosphere as it continuously emitted explosion that swallowed the long sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Violent attackFist and sword both collided with each other, as a powerful momentum a wave of True Qi surged in every direction. As the azure aura exploded, Chen Xiang\u2019s vigorous True Qi broke Yao Tianhua\u2019s long sword with a sharp sound.Chen Xiang\u2019s [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist] were unstoppable. Violent fists with powerful and steaming True Qi smashed into Yao Tianhua, pressuring him until he was unable to move his body nor was he able to take a breath.\u201cStop!\u201d Just then the Yao Family Elder shouted, but Chen Xiang\u2019s fists were like thunderbolts attacking from the sky. Everyone was extremely shocked, even their eyes and mouths were fully open. Accompanied by powerful wind, Yao Tianhua body flew off the stage, vomiting large amounts of blood as he fainted mid-air.The Yao Family Elder as well as several of the Yao Family bodyguards quickly flew into the sky and landed near the fallen Yao Tianhua.\u201cYou\u2026.you actually injured him so heavily!\u201d the Yao Family Elder angrily shouted. He quickly took out a pill and placed it inside Yao Tianhua\u2019s mouth.After treating Yao Tianhua, he handed him over to the Yao Family bodyguards, then the Yao Family Elder jumped up onto the High stage.Chen Xiang, just with his fists, broke Yao Tianhua\u2019s sword and severely wounded him in the process. This level of strength made others hang their heads in shame. At this time, the other family juniors were very excited, because they realized that the Chen and Yao Families were now mortal enemies. Moreover that Yao Family Elder was currently preparing to fight Chen Xiang.The Chen Family Elders and branch commanders were also getting ready to deal with the trouble, but before they could move they were stopped by Chen Tianhu, In a low voice he said to them \u201cEveryone do not move! We will simply watch this spectacular play.\u201dChen Yihan said with a somewhat unnatural complexion \u201cThis brat defeated me with only a 5th level Mortal Martial Realm strength. Now he has already advanced to the 6th level. That Yao Family Elder will absolutely not be able to take advantage of him in any way.\u201dAlthough the Yao Family Elder\u2019s strength was in 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, for Chen Xiang, who cultivated divine exercises and had a Yin and Yang Divine Veins, it would not be difficult for him to defeat the Yao Family Elder.Someone who was highly talented with huge potential would become the future of their family. Although Chen Family was very powerful, they also had many powerful families that were secretly hostile towards them. Now that the other family\u2019s juniors had witnessed Chen Xiang\u2019s strength, those families with vile intentions against Chen Family were bound to restrain their thoughts. Also, the other families would try to get friendly with the Chen Family to establish equally beneficial relations.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can the younger generation not beat the elders?\u201d Chen Xiang sneered, while his pair of fists occasionally burst out with azure lightning. Everyone present in the field was surprised, didn\u2019t Chen Xiang cultivate flames? How come he was releasing such violent lightning True Qi?The Yao Family Elder was not stupid. He realized that this was not the true extent of Chen Xiang\u2019s strength. What surprised him even more was the fact that the Chen Family experts didn\u2019t even step forward to help Chen Xiang! This made the Yao Family Elder feel an inexplicable shame, because the Chen Family experts believed that Chen Xiang could easily cope with him, in fact it seemed like they disdained to even step forward to deal with him!Chen Xiang looked at the Yao Family Elder standing in front of him and said while watching that old face grimaced in anger \u201cYao Family Elder, in the end what did you come here to do? Are you also going to exchange pointers with me?\u201dExchange pointers? One who had lived dozens of years was going to exchange pointers with a ten or so year old brat! This was simply going to make him a laughing stock, whether he wins or not, this matter could only tarnish his reputation.\u201cYou\u2026you wounded Tianhua!\u201d the Yao Family Elder really had nothing else to say because he simply jumped up on the stage in spur of the moment.Chen Xiang slowly said in a relaxed tone, \u201cSo what? If I did not retaliate, his sword would have pierced my throat! I did not kill him, that is already me being lenient!\u201dAnyone could see that Yao Tianhua\u2019s sword attack was very ruthless, so Chen Xiang\u2019s actions were also natural. Furthermore, they were in a martial compet.i.tion, getting injured was obviously unavoidable!Only the Yao Family Elder felt unjustified, he belonged to one dignified dan aristocratic family, and had a wide network of many strong families who had alliances with the Yao Family. But today, the Yao Family not only lost their precious herbs but also their face. Moreover, the Yao Family prided alchemist also got injured, and all of this was due to Chen Xiang!\u201cHahaha....\u201d the Yao Family Elder suddenly looked up and laughed: \u201cOne little Chen Family really dares to overestimate their own capabilities and is going to try to oppose my Yao Family! Today I will teach a lesson to a brat who does not even know the immensity of heaven and earth!\u201dThe Yao Family Elder was already desperate, in his opinion the Chen Family was only a small family, even if he taught a lesson to Chen Xiang this one time, the Chen Family would not dare to say anything. Plus, even if the two families went to war, the Yao Family would definitely not lose.\u201cShameless old b.a.s.t.a.r.d! It\u2019s your Yao Family who don\u2019t know the immensity of heavens and earth. The Yao Family has already lost face because of you today.\u201d Chen Xiang said in a loud and clear voice which resounded over the whole field.In their hearts, everyone had already secretly despised the Yao Family. They didn\u2019t even admit defeat and now they were also trying to bully the weak. They were relying on their strength and prosperity, regardless of morality and justice they were going to attack Chen Xiang. It was simply too ridiculous!The Yao Family Elder got more angry. With a howl, his whole body was suddenly covered in fiery-red True Qi. From both of his eyes fire was gus.h.i.+ng out and with just one step he appeared in front of Chen Xiang. Both of the Yao Family Elder\u2019s palms resembled radiant fiery meteors and the strike rushed towards Chen Xiang. Whilst an invisible wall made of the fiery True Qi aura surrounded Chen Xiang.Those pair of hot palms had not yet hit Chen Xiang, but the invisible True aura had already penetrated Chen Xiang\u2019s body. Yet he just stood still with calmness and tranquillity, similar to a mountain even when faced with the scorching flames. Both his fists were overflowing with True Qi, azure light flas.h.i.+ng above them. They immediately transformed into tiger heads, and this attack was even bigger than the one that heavily injured Yao Tianhua!Flames were gus.h.i.+ng out from the Yao Family Elder\u2019s whole body, appearing ferocious like an angry fiery devil, vigorous True Qi gathered around on his pair of skinny palms.\u201cOld man, actually even against me you are resorting to such a heavy hand! Then I\u2019m also not going to be polite!\u201d Chen Xiang suddenly roared like a mad dragon, while azure Qi waves spewed out from inside his mouth. Suddenly, a fierce azure wind started blowing. Within this fierce wind, azure lightning was flas.h.i.+ng one after another. At the same time Chen Xiang like a bolt moved towards the Yao Family Elder, that pair of tiger heads fists instantaneously transformed into two solemn and powerful Azure Dragon heads.The [Azure Dragon Roar] released a fierce wind containing lightning, and it was very powerful. After seeing this, the Yao Family Elder could not help but be surprised, at this time he also saw two giant dragons that were roaring and rus.h.i.+ng towards him.\u201cYou brat!!!!!!\u201dthe Yao Family Elder was panic-stricken from watching Chen Xiang\u2019s violent True Qi rus.h.i.+ng towards him.Both of Chen Xiang\u2019s fists met with the approaching Yao Family Elder\u2019s fire palms. Punching each other away, the palm and fist fiercely collided. \u2018Bang!\u2019 With thunderous sounds and with various flas.h.i.+ng lights due to the blast, Qi waves resembled sea waves, as the hurricane like momentum spread in every direction, instantaneously destroying the high stage and even lifted up some of the nearby dining tables and chairs.Everyone was dumbstruck, unexpectedly a sixteen year old teenager was on par with the Yao Family Elder, moreover he even got the upper hand! Everyone could clearly notice the blood overflowing from the corners of the mouth of the Yao Family Elder.Although Chen Xiang looked embarra.s.sed and could not bear with it, but he was steadily standing there like a mountain, with uniform breath. Unlike the Yao Family Elder, who was panting. Everyone could see that the Yao Family Elder probably had consumed a huge amount of True Qi to withstand the crazy and fierce attack from Chen Xiang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Granduncle\u201cIn the end, what martial skill did you use?\u201d the Yao Family Elder asked with an ugly complexion. If Chen Xiang hadn\u2019t cultivated the peerless divine exercise, it would have been impossible for him to endure with just his 6th level of Mortal Martial Realm strength.Chen Xiang didn\u2019t answer, but clenched both his fists, and in the next moment, two tiger heads once again appeared above them. Step by step he advanced, and in the blink of an eye, only his fist\u2019s shadow was visible, and like numerous ferocious tigers, they bombarded on Yao Family Elder. After each and every fists, a violent explosion took place, resulting in the ground to continuously shake. After the Yao elder was struck 10 times, his True Qi encompa.s.sing his body shattered. He had to use his own body to resist the rest of Chen Xiang\u2019s storm like fists.Chen Xiang fist were not only violent but fierce and ruthless too, each fist struck on Yao Family Elder\u2019s body, making everyone shudder. They were thinking about what would happen if they were hit by those fists!At this point everyone present in the field was staring with their mouths wide open. Looking at Chen Xiang\u2019s oppressive attacks, if they had not personally watched this, it would have been difficult for them to believe that a sixteen year old teenager actually made a Yao Family Elder, a punching bag. This level of strength sent s.h.i.+vers down their spines.\u201cCompeting with the Yao Family members is simply humiliating! Willing to bet but does not concede when they\u2019ve lost, get out of here!\u201d Chen Xiang shouted while he sent a flying kick towards the body of the Yao Family Elder, which sent him towards the nearby Yao Family bodyguards. The Yao Family Elder had already fainted due to severe injuries, several of his bones were broken by Chen Xiang\u2019s [Heavenly tiger Storm Killing Fists].At this time, everyone suspected that it was some sort of illusion, as they simply couldn\u2019t believe that Chen Xiang was capable of seriously injuring the Yao Family Elder! This time they were convinced, Chen Xiang must have practiced a peerless martial skill otherwise it would be impossible for him to have this level of strength.Yao Tianhua and the Yao Family Elder came up on stage, on their legs, but now they were being carried out. Moreover they asked for it, today\u2019s matter was observed by many people. Even if the Yao Family wanted to pursue the Chen Family, they could not say anything. After all it was the Yao Family who acted first.Late at night, everyone who was invited to the Chen Family banquet departed in full excitement, they were not at all disappointed with the Chen Family\u2019s banquet.Although everyone left, the banquet still kept on going, this was the Chen Family\u2019s own banquet. All the broken tables, chairs and spoilt food was now being replaced, the table\u2019s were once again filled with delicacies and good wines. The Chen Family were celebrating for their new patriarch and cheered for, the birth of a new powerful figure, Chen Xiang. This could make the whole Chen Family\u2019s status elevate.In the morning, sunlight was s.h.i.+ning on the chaotic field. On the field a large number of Chen Family members were dead drunk, but Chen Tianhu and numerous elders were energetic like dragons and fierce as tigers. After all they were the main support of the Chen Family and they needed to remain vigilant at all times.Chen Xiang and Chen Tianhu sent off the Chen Family branch commanders, only after this they let out a sigh of relief.\u201cDad, inside Wohu City only Spirit Dan Hall sells dans. Later on when we buy dans from them, it will definitely be expensive, which is very troublesome for us.\u201d Chen Xiang said with a wry smile.Chen Tianhu rubbed his temples and said: \u201cNow are you thinking about this? You ruthlessly humiliated the Yao Family and now you want your father to wipe your a.s.s?!\u201dChen Xiang stuck out his tongue and then asked: \u201cIt\u2019s not a big problem\u2026 right?\u201dChen Tianhu coldly replied: \u201cRest a.s.sured, although the Yao Family is a dan aristocratic family, our Chen Family is definitely not a vegetarian! But the issue regarding dans is a bit hard to solve.\u201d[ED: The vegetarian bit might confuse some, but it basically means they are not scared to spill blood.]At this time one sound came: \u201cActually this issue is not at all hard to solve, under the heavens it is not just the Yao Family who sells dans, although Spirit Dan Hall is the Yao Family property but what about other cities?\u201dThe voice belonged to Spirit Dan Hall Lord, his name was known to only few people, even Chen Tianhu was not clear about it.\u201cHall lord, although I won the bet with Yao Tianhua but you are still free, except that you can\u2019t return to Spirit Dan Hall, aside from that you can go anywhere you want!\u201dSaid Chen Xiang.Spirit Dan Hall Lord replied: \u201cDo not call me hall lord, this old man is a well-known figure, I\u2019m called Chen Luzhong!\u201dThis name came as a surprise to Chen Xiang and Chen Tianhu, to their surprise Spirit Dan Hall Lord was surnamed Chen! Chen Xiang\u2019s grandfather was also called Chen Luhong, so it came as a surprise for Chen Tianhu.\u201cHa-ha-ha, do you know why your grandfather and I have so much hatred?\u201d Chen Luzhong looked at Chen Xiang and laughingly asked: \u201cBecause he is my elder brother, simply because I was not able to become patriarch at that time and had some conflict with him, I left the family. After leaving the family, I started to learn alchemy and at last established Spirit Dan Hall, using it I planned to make amends with your grandfather.\u201d\u201cSince he has left the Chen Family, then I have nothing to come back for. If you want this old man I\u2019m willing to solve the dan problem for you.\u201d Chen Luzhong turned his head and looked at the Chen Family main gate, the expression in his eyes was as if he fondly remembered something.Chen Xiang with a smile said: \u201cGranduncle, if you can stay behind it will be definitely good. Otherwise the whole dan issue will become a heavy burden that will fall on my head.\u201dChen Tianhu also said: \u201cUncle, Welcome back to the Chen Family!\u201dChen Luzhong only slightly smiled, with sentimental countenance looking at Chen Tianhu: \u201cWhen I left the Chen Family you were just a kid back then, I was very young at that time. Now I am too old, you youngsters look after the Chen Family.\u201dAfter last night\u2019s banquet, Chen Xiang\u2019s name had spread to elders of various forces, the Chen Family\u2019s new position was also being evaluated.The Chen Family now had two alchemists and they wouldn\u2019t need to worry about dans, but at present the only root of the problem was herbs source. For low level herbs it was not an issue, however high level herbs were rather expensive and rare. The Yao Family held the majority of many high level herbs.Inside a private room, Chen Xiang, with Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao, was discussing the situation of the Chen Family. He was hoping that before he joined a martial arts sect, the Chen Family would become very powerful.\u201cThis is not a problem, your Chen Family is only missing the herbs! You can just go to the nearby city and simply buy some and return. You can first sell that Blood Spirit Gra.s.s.\u201d Su Meiyao said while playing with the Thousand Year Beast Dan.Chen Xiang said with some sorrow: \u201cThat is but thousand year old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, it is very rare.\u201dSu Meiyao placed back the Thousand Year Beast Dan in Chen Xiang\u2019s hand and laughingly said: \u201cDon\u2019t you have the [Dragon Saliva Exercise]? So long as you have time, even the ten thousand old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s is not a problem. However Blood Spirit Gra.s.s is a Low Level Spirit Herb, and no matter how high its maturity is, its efficiency is far too limited, however that h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s is pretty good!\u201dDragon Saliva, it could accelerate growth of spirit herbs. If one kind of spirit herb was continuously nourished with it, then you could grow the spirit herb with high maturity, Chen Xiang after thinking this through became restless, he wanted to try something. He wanted to see if he could grow a ten thousand year old Blood spirit gra.s.s.Su Meiyao, as if she could see through his thoughts in a tender voice, said: \u201cDo not try to attempt to mature the Blood Spirit Gra.s.s up to ten thousand years, that is simply a waste. When it is used to nourish other high ranking spirit herbs it will be more cost-effective! You should know the [Dragon Saliva Exercise] congeals out the essence of sun and moon, plus the Dragon Saliva is congealed out only by using your Azure Dragon True Qi, you do not have the liberty to waste it at will.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Real stageChen Xiang nodded and said: \u201cUnderstood, Sister Youyou sister, when will you teach me those devil skills?\u201dBai Youyou looked at him coldly out of the corner of her eye, and said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t even completely grasped junior sister\u2019s [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] yet, so don\u2019t even think about learning the devil skills. You still have a long way to go.\u201dChen Xiang was currently able to use only a portion of the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] and the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise], while the [White Tiger Divine Exercise] and the [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise] were exceptionally difficult to practice, and also had some special requirements to practice them.[Azure Dragon Claw] and [Azure Dragon Roar] from the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] were relatively easy to learn, and [Vermillion Bird Profound Fire] and [Vermillion Bird Fire Wing] were also the same. Although the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] consisted of many powerful martial techniques, they required a certain amount of strength to be able to start practicing them, otherwise Qigong deviation would occur.[TLN: Qigong deviation is simply imbalance in Qi.]Late at night, hidden deep below the ground, inside a private room, a \u2018peng peng\u2019 sound was being transmitted intermittently. This was caused by Chen Xiang practising his martial skills. Just looking at his bare-chest, one could see incomparably strong muscles, that turned to a shade of dark red due to the slightly surging out hot Qi, while he was standing steadily in a horse stance and was. .h.i.tting the iron wall not far away from him. At this time, hot Qi waves were bursting out of his fists, combined with an invisible fist strength and were striking the iron wall, due to which the land shook and trembled.\u201cNot bad, within a day\u2019s time, you were able to grasp the [Fire King Fists], which is a basic attack skill of the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise]. However it gets more difficult as you advance, you can now rest up.\u201d Su Meiyao was also a little bored and tired as she had been sitting there watching as Chen Xiang practised for the whole day.Chen Xiang looked at that mature and ample bosom of Su Meiyao, and with a smile said, \u201cSister Meiyao, I need to take a shower, would you like to join?\u201dSu Meiyao with her gentle and enchanting voice, and eyes full of charm said, \u201cI have to call senior sister to join us. I fear you will not be honest at that time.\u201dSpeaking of Bai Youyou, Chen Xiang\u2019s complexion suddenly froze: \u201cForget about it.\u201dSu Meiyao, while laughing loudly, entered the invisible ring on Chen Xiang\u2019s finger. Inside the ring, there was a small room, where all the daily necessities were present. Inside the ring, the two girls\u2019 lives were also very relaxed.The next day, Chen Xiang woke up and spat out the \u2018Dragon Saliva\u2019 present inside his mouth in a small bottle, but he did not immediately go out and pour it on some herbs. He was currently saving and leaving it for the future.Chen Xiang wanted to look for Chen Luzhong to talk about alchemy, but did not expect that Chen Luzhong had already departed to purchase the spirit herbs. Moreover he also left behind spirit herbs required to refine dans.These were already matured spirit herbs, Chen Xiang was also very happy to use them for refining dans, which could also help increase his alchemical experience.One day, two days, after three days had pa.s.sed, Chen Xiang finished all the spirit herbs left behind by Chen Luzhong. Because most of these spirit herbs were of the low-grade mortal level, the dans refined were also of same level. At this time the Chen Family also had enough dans to cope for some time.These days, many of the Chen Family juniors gathered around Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang would often go to martial arts field and exchange pointers with the Chen Family youths, and would sometimes also give them advice, which was very helpful for them.\u201cXiang Er, can you attend the King City\u2019s martial art tournament and obtain the first place reward of the High-Grade Spirit Level True Elemental Dan?\u201d Chen Tianhu suddenly came to the martial arts field.Chen Xiang, after giving it some thought, said, \u201cI want to go to other cities to purchase some spirit herbs. At that time, along the way if it is convenient I will partic.i.p.ate!\u201dAt this time, one of the Chen Family children said, \u201cChen Xiang please partic.i.p.ate. If we go it will definitely be hopeless, but I heard that in the King City\u2019s martial arts tournament many talented people will be partic.i.p.ating. Some even have the strength at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\u201dOne girl while nodding also said, \u201cI also heard that many people who returned from martial arts sects will also be partic.i.p.ating.\u201dChen Xiang heard all the information which can be summarized as such. King City\u2019s martial arts tournament was held once every ten years. The partic.i.p.ants must be below the age of twenty, and it was conducted by the largest city of Southern Martial Empire, King City. The present area of King City was previously the location of four different cities, but as the cities developed more and more and more people started to settle in, the four cities expanded and got well interconnected which later resulted in them combining to form a single major city.That was King CityKing City was also the royal capital of the Southern Martial Empire. The Yao Family and the imperial palace were also situated there. Many of the formidable families of the Southern Martial Empire were also established there, which led to many experts gathering there.Chen Tianhu also nodded and said, \u201cKing City\u2019s martial arts tournament also has one more purpose which is to select some excellent pract.i.tioners to enter those martial arts sects. You should already know that the whole Southern Martial Empire is affiliated with those martial arts sects!\u201dMartial arts families were required to pay taxes each year as a tribute to the imperial palace, while the Southern Martial Empire offered them to martial arts sects. Obviously these martial arts sects were formidable enough to dominate all the major families of the whole kingdom.\u201cDo not think that these taxes are handed over in vain, you should know that these martial arts sects are necessary to maintain our safety. Otherwise this place will most likely encounter a group of demon beasts, demons or devils and will be easily slaughtered.\u201d Chen Tianhu was looking up at the sky as he said in an imposing tone.All the Chen family juniors suddenly went into an uproar. Previously they thought that these big sects were some kind of legendary existences, but now that they came to know that these legendary sects maintained such close relations with the mortal world, they were surprised.The Southern Martial Empire could be considered to be very big with a population of some dozen hundred millions, but still there weren\u2019t many truly powerful martial pract.i.tioners and as for alchemists, they were as rare as finding the feathers of a phoenix and horns of a unicorn. However, with such a huge population, there were bound to be some good martial pract.i.tioners, so these martial arts sect would sometimes come here to recruit such pract.i.tioners. The fastest and the most effective way to select them was to gather all of these formidable and strong youngsters in a place and make them fight and the strongest from them all would attain the qualifications to enter these martial arts sects.[TLN: feathers of phoenix and horns of unicorn, Chinese idiom meaning extremely rare]Chen Xiang arrived at the library with Chen Tianhu. Along the way Chen Xiang noticed that Chen Tianhu must have had something important to say, because Chen Tianhu\u2019s complexion had been very serious since earlier.Once they were inside the library, Chen Tianhu said, \u201cXiang Er, your granduncle Chen Luzhong has already gone to King City! Our Chen family in the eyes of many people is considered to be a formidable martial arts aristocratic family, but we are still unable to enter the King City. We cannot be regarded as an unconditionally strong and prosperous family, so our Chen Family\u2019s next target is King City.\u201dChen Xiang also heard some information, such as the Yao Family also had some relations with those martial arts sects and also that the Yao Family doesn\u2019t pay taxes to the imperial palace but rather directly offers them to these sects.\u201cThe Xue Family is also migrating to King City now! Because of Xue Xianxian, the Xue Family was able to establish themselves due to their relations with a strong martial arts sect! But if we want to strive there and open a path for the Chen Family, we can only rely on you and your granduncle.\u201d Chen Tianhu\u2019s hands were pressing on Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulder as he sincerely said.Chen Xiang while frowning asked, \u201cWhat do I need to do? Join a martial arts sect?\u201dChen Tianhu shook his head and said, \u201cNo, even if you are able to join a martial arts sect, the Chen Family still will not be able to get the support of those big sects. Now the only way is to get our Chen Family noticed by those big sects, and then make them look for us on their own initiative! The only way to do this is to show off your talent in alchemy.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s gaze turned fierce, a bright flash flickered in his eyes, and he was grinning with a smile as he said, \u201cI know what to do. I will pick some things up and then go to King City and meet up with granduncle.\u201dChen Tianhu patted Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulder, and with a smile on his face, said, \u201cXiang Er, your stage is not here in this mortal world, but rather at those martial arts sects where strong pract.i.tioners are as numerous as trees in a forest!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: KillerAfter packing up some simple things and slightly changing his appearance, Chen Xiang started his solitary journey towards King City. With his strength, as long as his opponent was not someone above the 8th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, it was difficult for them to pose any threat to him. In the whole Southern Martial Empire there were not many who had reached the 8th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, so Chen Tianhu was a.s.sured about his safety.The distance from Wohu City to King City was relatively far, and one needed to travel at least five or six days to reach their destination. Along the way there was no noticeable danger, unless one was seeking death and tried to enter the mountain forest where demon beasts frequently roamed.\u201cBrat, currently you do not need to rush to enter those martial art sects, the compet.i.tion inside those sects are very intense. If you do not have absolute strength, you will only further humiliate yourself!\u201d Bai Youyou said.\u201cUnderstood, Sister Youyou!\u201d Chen Xiang felt slightly warm in his heart as it was rare for this ice cold beauty to care about him.At this time Chen Xiang was already very far away from Wohu City and had already arrived in the wilderness, this was the first time he been so far away from Wohu City, his heart was somewhat excited but also vigilant.In the evening as the whole sky turned dark, Chen Xiang stopped at a nearby forest. While walking on the dirt road, Chen Xiang suddenly noticed some movements behind him.\u201cd.a.m.n, this father is already being followed, moreover there are several of them!\u201d Chen Xiang cursed in his mind while increasing his guard. He operated his True Qi and gathered it at his feet so that he could quickly dodge or attack at any time.\u201cDo not panic, let them come out. If you cannot defeat them then just flee. With the help of the [Vermillion Bird Fire-Wing] you can easily escape.\u201d Su Meiyao transmitted to Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang replied with the help of his divine sense \u201cI\u2019m not panicking, I\u2019m just in a bad mood, have they been stalking me for a long time? Have they been following me from Wohu City ?\u201d\u201cReally useless, you were being followed since the beginning!\u201d Bai Youyou said with contempt, which elevated the bad mood of Chen Xiang more.Chen Xiang turned around and in a cold voice said: \u201cHow long are you going to follow me? All of you, get your f.u.c.king a.s.ses out here.\u201dJust shortly after he shouted.\u2018shua shua shua\u2019Five masked black robed men appeared in front of him. He remembered that not long ago he had helped the Xue family children cope with some black robed killers, but he had not expected that he would also encounter them.These five black robed men really had been following Chen Xiang from Wohu City. It's just that Chen Xiang had been very vigilant since the beginning, which made it harder for them to sneak attack him. Now that they had been discovered by Chen Xiang, their only choice was to come out and fight.Only the eyes of the black robed men were visible, the expressions in their eyes were very dull. One could clearly see that they were certainly experienced in this line of business. As soon as they appeared each one took out a two-edged pitch black broadsword from their storage pouch, as they poured the True Qi, they raised their swords and at the same time leapt towards Chen Xiang.The five killers actions were although simple but at the same time were also quick and ruthless. In the moment they leaped, two flames flickered in Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes, hot Qi soared from his whole body, as Vermillion Bird True Qi suddenly poured into his arms. His right hand burst out with a fiery aura and a long fire whip congealed from Vermillion Bird True Qi appeared in his hand, it quickly swooped towards those five black robed men. As it brushed past the five of them, their robes were instantly ignited.The five black robed men had to give up attacking Chen Xiang and retreated to one side. The flames compared to before were much more formidable now. They were not able to withstand the flames and some even had to discard their burning robes.Chen Xiang exposed a sneer on his face, the fire whip in his hands mercilessly whipped towards a black robed man\u2019s head. An explosion followed just after the fire whip struck the black robed man, which was then followed by a burst of fire aura which instantly incinerated the black robed man into ash.The Vermillion Bird flames were no ordinary flames, they were cultivated from the divine exercise and was thus unmatched in power.These five black robed men\u2019s strengths were merely at the 5th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and with only this much strength, trying to a.s.sa.s.sinate Chen Xiang was just wishful thinking. Chen Xiang again started waving the fire whip, in the blink of an eye he had already whipped three black robed men and killed them.These black robed men in front of the fire whip were like b.u.t.ter being in front of a hot knife. Their bodies were easily cut down in half with just a sweep of the fire whip!Only with the help of a powerful divine sense was it possible to congeal True Qi into a strong weapon!\u201cSister Youyou, do you have a way to make this guy talk?\u201d Chen Xiang caught the remaining black robed man, but he refused to say anything.Bai Youyou coldly smiled: \u201cYou asked the right person, just follow my instructions. First, with one hand hold down his head, then congeal out your divine sense. Operate your divine sense exactly as I tell you. First divide your divine sense in six parts and then pour it into his head from these six different locations.\u201dChen Xiang complied immediately, this method was easy to understand and its results were also very quick. The black robed man\u2019s eyes became noticeably sluggish and lost its l.u.s.tre. He also did not make any effort to struggle like before.\u201cYou can now ask him.\u201d Bai Youyou said.Chen Xiang praised this mysterious odd skill of Bai Youyou, then to the black robed man asked: \u201cWho sent you to kill me?\u201d\u201cYao Family seventh elder!\u201d The voice of the black robed man was stiff and was without any trace of emotion.A trace of ruthlessness flashed in the eyes of Chen Xiang, he had not thought it would turn out to be the Yao Family who sent them, he continued and asked \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\u201cOn his way to King City.\u201d That black robed man replied.Chen Xiang lifted up the black robed man by his robes and asked: \u201cDid you also try to a.s.sa.s.sinate those family juniors?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The black robed man replied.Chen Xiang\u2019s countenance was solemn as well as surprised, this matter turned out to be related to the Yao Family.\u201cWhy would the Yao Family try to a.s.sa.s.sinate those families\u2019 children attending the banquet?\u201d Chen Xiang once again asked.\u201cI do not know!\u201d Black robe man replied.Chen Xiang asked a few other questions, when he could not get anything out of the black robed man, he killed him and incinerated his body.The sky was completely dark, various stars were s.h.i.+ning in the sky and suddenly a vibrant red light soared across the sky. It looked similar to an ordinary meteor, but a meteor does not travel horizontally.That light was Chen Xiang. After releasing his [Vermillion Bird fire-wing] he immediately rushed through the night to chase the Yao family seventh elder, it was exactly the Yao elder who was previously wounded by him!Releasing True Qi he transformed it into wings. Not only did he consume a large amount of his divine sense, but he also simultaneously consumed a lot of True Qi. But since Chen Xiang practiced the Five Elements True Qi, only the fire attributed Vermillion Bird True Qi was consumed, while the Azure dragon True Qi within his body was in surplus.It should be known that martial skills capable of transforming True Qi into wings were not many. This type of martial skills were extremely rigorous because True Qi is needed to be emitted from the back, which required an accurate control of divine sense to transform it into wings, this would make them look similar to the wings of a bird. The slightest mistake and the user would fall down,which was very dangerous. These kind of martial skills were regarded as treasures by the martial artists. Chen Xiang learned from Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao that even in those martial arts sects, such skills were extremely rare.So at the time of casting this skill Chen Xiang was especially careful, as he wanted to catch up with Yao Family Elder convoy without delay.If others could try to kill him, why could he not do the same?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: King CityChen Xiang would absolutely not leave anyone alive after they tried to kill him, moreover, he could not pa.s.s on such a good opportunity to weaken the Yao Family.\"That's right! On the road of martial arts, one should kill decisively! Otherwise, if grievances are acc.u.mulated in the heart, it will easily lead to Qigong deviation. By any means, you should catch up to that fellow and behead him!\" Bai Youyou's words were filled with Slaughter Qi.Chen Xiang was still flying, this allowed him to feel wonderful in every way. Since childhood, he had always wanted the ability to fly, and now he had it! This was all thanks to the two peerless beauties inside his ring.\"Sister Youyou, how did you become Sister Meiyao\u2019s senior sister? It\u2019s difficult to imagine what kind of person your master is!\" Chen Xiang sighed from the bottom of his heart. If the apprentices were already this formidable, then just how powerful was their teacher?[TLN: Senior sister as in seniors sister apprentice.]\"Our teacher did not have a name, regarding his origins, even we are not clear. Perhaps when you advance to that stage you might even be able to meet him.\" Bai Youyou said.Chen Xiang was very curious about these two enigmatic girls, but at the same time, he was also very helpless since they were reluctant to disclose the information he wanted to know.Chen Xiang flew the entire night, furthermore, he chose to fly on the outskirts of the wilderness. After the third night, he could see a carriage in the distance which was slowly moving forward on an avenue. This avenue led to King City since these types of roads were only built near King City.Chen Xiang stared at that avenue in the distance, he was vaguely able to see large houses and the King City which was not too far away from him. Once the Yao Family members set foot in King City, Chen Xiang would not have the opportunity to enact his revenge.That carriage had two coachmen and two horse-riding bodyguards. The strongest among them was the Yao Family Elder, and after him was Yao Tianhua. However, both had been wounded by Chen Xiang and the strongest out of the two coachmen and the bodyguards were only at the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\"When they came to Wohu City, there had been many people with them, but now only one carriage is left!\" Chen Xiang muttered as he flew to the front.\"They should have been hiding killers in the caravan. They must have first sent some people back to the Yao Family as messengers, and some of them should have remained in Wohu City to guard the Spirit Dan Hall. As such, only these people are left.\" Chen Xiang guessed.He stopped at the edge of the avenue which was situated near a forest. After resting for a little bit, he put on a black robe and hood, after all, he was going to kill important members of the Yao Family. If they came to know the ident.i.ty of the killer, a war would break out between the Yao and the Chen Families.Although the night was dark, a gentle silver white moonlight shone upon the land. This gentle pale aura allowed people not to be engulfed in utter darkness.Chen Xiang, who was hiding on a tree near the roadside, held his breath and waited for the carriage to arrive. The sound of the carriage was accompanied by the insects chirping at night.Chen Xiang's heart was as calm and tranquil as water, but on the contrary, his eyes shone with killing intent, staring at the avenue under the tree.It had arrived! Just as the carriage was pa.s.sing by, Chen Xiang's body sprung like a silent arrow that was released from a bow. At the same time, he congealed out a golden long whip in his hand. Slaughter Qi was emitted by the long whip, accompanied by a violent aura.The whip was congealed from the metal attributed True Qi, this metal attribute corresponded to the White Tiger. The [White Tiger Divine Exercise] signified slaughter and ruthlessness. To further its progress, one should indulge in endless killing and comprehend the way of slaughtering.While Chen Xiang leapt towards the carriage, he ruthlessly swung the whip downwards, striking right at the middle of the carriage. With a weapon similar to a two-edged long knife chopping down, the luxurious carriage was splitted into two with a crackling sound. Two people simultaneously jumped out, one of them was the Yao Family Elder, and the other was Yao Tianhua.\"Which gang of bandits do you belong to? We are the Yao family's...\"The Yao Family Elder had not even finished with his sentence before Chen Xiang swung his whip like lightning four more times, hitting the two coachman and the two bodyguards as they were just about to draw their blades and jump off their horses.The long golden whip, which contained valiant metal attributed True Qi accompanied by Slaughter Qi, simultaneously struck their upper body. Similar to striking tofu, the four people became separate pieces of flesh and blood. This type of brutal True Qi had not only made the Yao Family Elder and Yao Tianhua panic-stricken, even Chen Xiang could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.\"You...you are CHEN XIANG!\" When the Yao Family Elder saw Chen Xiang, he suddenly shouted, however, Chen Xiang's whip had already ruthlessly struck down on his body.The Yao Family Elder was worthy of being a 7th level of Mortal Martial Realm martial artist. Although he was seriously injured, he was still able to gather True Qi in his body and catch the whip laden with White Tiger Slaughtering True Qi.\"You really are Chen Xiang!\" the Yao Family Elder said in a high-pitched voice. The expression in his eyes could not conceal his fear. He had not thought Chen Xiang would actually dare to come and try to kill them so brutally.Chen Xiang remained silent, in his left hand, fire aura flashed while another fire whip was also congealed, and then he opened his mouth and roared, using wood attribute True Qi.The [Azure Dragon Roar] wreaked havoc on the Yao Family Elder, at this time, Chen Xiang's Vermillion Bird True Qi whip lashed accurately above the Yao Family Elder's neck, breaking his head into pieces.Nearby, Yao Tianhua was already frightened by Chen Xiang. Not only could he cast the purest alchemy flame, but he could also use the metal attribute slaughtering True Qi, and at the same time, he could even release wood attribute True Qi! This was displaying three types of attributes at the same time! To Yao Tianhua\u2019s knowledge, this sort of feat had never been heard of!Chen Xiang moved towards Yao Tianhua, his eyes flas.h.i.+ng with killing intent. He swung the golden long whip in his hand and it lashed towards Yao Tianhua's neck, and in that instant, Yao Tianhua emitted a panic-stricken cry as his eyes were filled with horror.As the long whip struck his neck, his head immediately fell down. With a frozen and frightened countenance, Yao Tianhua had died filled with both disbelief and resentment. He had never expected that as the Yao Family genius, his death would actually happen in such a way.Chen Xiang inhaled a mouthful of air and faintly said, \"Originally, at the time when you tried to stab me with your sword, I already wanted kill you!\"After killing the two of them, Chen Xiang removed their storage pouches. They contained some spirit coins and herbs, it still could be considered as a substantial income.In order to not leave any traces, Chen Xiang tidied up the scene with great difficulty . If one was to arrive where the carriage had been, no one would be able to notice that a one sided ma.s.sacre had taken place here.Chen Xiang walked on the avenue towards the tall and prosperous city.King City was vast and was surrounded by thick walls. Chen Xiang looked at the endless wall and the moat outside of the City. Many people were going in and out of the enormous city gate, and many soldiers stood on the city wall and next to the gate. The lively streets were covered with smooth bricks and were full of pedestrians, such a scene was clearly visible through the gate.Chen Xiang finally arrived inside of King City. He curiously looked around. Before, he had thought that Wohu City was quite big and lively, but now, he discovered that he was a frog in a well. He did not know just how vast King City was, but he knew that it was many times larger than Wohu City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Danxiang Herbal ManorAfter entering the city, Chen Xiang saw many people were gathering in front of a very long wall. He went over and found that a lot information was put up on that wall. They were either giving some directions or some kind of other informations. On top of everything, there was also a map of the entire city indicating some inns, well-known stores, imperial palace, and marital family addresses\u2026The map itself was very detailed, Chen Xiang soon found where the Yao Family was on the map. It was located not far away from the Imperial Palace. He also saw where the Xue Family was on the map, currently, the Xue Family was still in the process of moving to King City.Another thing that had caught Chen Xiang\u2019s attention was that there was information regarding the buying and selling of items, looking for missing persons or items, and recruitment offers for various jobs. This was to help people who were new to King City.Chen Xiang swept through the myriad of information, to his surprise a recruitment poster was posted by his Granduncle.\"Recruiting alchemist, location is...posted by Chen Luzhong.\"Chen Xiang remembered the location posted and then looked at the map to find it.\"Granduncle moves really fast. He just arrived at King City and has already found a good store!\" Chen Xiang could see from the map that the location of the store was quite good, it was situated at the corner of a crossroad and moreover it was a three-story building.After memorizing the route, Chen Xiang left immediately.He soon arrived at his destination, but the store was closed and its doors were heavily damaged, there were many slashes with other markings on it.Chen Xiang tightly frowned and knocked on the door.\"WHO?\" A very angry voice came from inside.\"Granduncle, it's me!\" Chen Xiang replied in a low voice, at this point he had already guessed the crux of the matter.As the door opened Chen Xiang saw Chen Luzhong's old face filled with anger.At this time, Chen Xiang clearly saw that the inside of the shop was actually a mess. Broken chairs, and walls cluttered with blade slashes, after seeing all of this Chen Xiang suddenly clenched his fists as they made brittle sounds, his eyes were filled with anger.\"Who did this?\" Chen Xiang gloomily asked, he swore in his heart that he would make that person pay ten times for what they had done.\"Come inside, then we will talk!\" Said Chen Luzhong.After Chen Xiang went inside, they went to third floor. On the way up, he could see the extent of the damage done. The walls, floors and roof were all heavily damaged, it was needless to mention the chairs and tables.The more Chen Xiang looked the more furious he got, but his facial expression was still tranquil, this made Chen Luzhong slightly surprised.On the third floor, Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong were sitting on the floor.\"The backyard is still good, I had invited two a.s.sistants to the shop but they have been injured, I just went to deliver some dans and spirit coins to them.\" Chen Luzhong sighed \"This store was bought by me a long time ago. However, when I went out this morning some people rushed in....then it became like this.\"\"Who did it? I will immediately make them pay!\" Chen Xiang was filled with killing intent. He had already killed the Yao Family Elder and genius, who wouldn\u2019t he dare to kill?\"I also want to go and teach a lesson to that fellow, but they\u2019re one of the shopkeepers of the alchemy force. If we offend them, later on it will be difficult for us to sell dans.\"Chen Xiang said in a cold voice, \"Granduncle, you don\u2019t need to worry! Our Chen Family has just entered King City. If we are bullied in front of our gate and yet yield to them, then in the future how will our Chen Family be able to settle here?\"\"I also understand this...However, the alchemy forces behind the shopkeeper wants to obtain this store, but I refused. Just after I posted the recruitment notice, he made his move. He wants to make me to retreat in the face of these difficulties.\"Chen Xiang while curling his lips said, \"Granduncle, you are an alchemist and surprisingly you are being oppressed by a mere shopkeeper.\"Chen Luzhong smilingly said, \"I\u2019m taking into consideration of the overall situation! Our Chen Family has already offended the Yao Family!\"In King City beside the Yao Family there was one more Alchemy Force and that was the Danxiang Herbal Manor. In King City and several other cities they had many branch stores, moreover they had always kept a low-profile, but now they had actually made such a move.[TLN: Danxiang(\u4e39\u9999) = Pill aroma or fragrance. ]\"Danxiang Herbal Manor? I'll go and find that shopkeeper! Which one of the five Danxiang Herbal Manors inside the King City does he have a shop?\" Chen Xiang stood up while brus.h.i.+ng the dust off his bottom. From his facial expression, anyone could clearly guess that he was not planning to give up.Chen Luzhong knew that today there was no other method to deal with this situation. He was also aware of his nephew\u2019s strength and arrogance, \"South side, remember not to murder anyone! In King City murdering anyone is not a good fruit to eat*! I will also go with you.\"[TLN: does not have a good result]Chen Xiang nodded his head, then with Chen Luzhong left the store.\"Granduncle, what is your current level?\"While being with Chen Luzhong, Chen Xiang could only sense Fire Qi and was unable to sense vigorous levels of True Qi from Chen Luzhong.\"Hei-hei, I'm not a vegetarian, but my strength still cannot be compared to your grandfather.\" Chen Luzhong only gave a vague answer to Chen Xiang.\"Little guy, King City has people that can be described as crouching tigers and hidden dragons *, so I dare not to arbitrarily act.\"[TLN= hidden experts.]Chen Xiang nodded and said, \"I understand, listening to what Granduncle has said, you should be very formidable! Unexpectedly you are still willing to admit defeat.\"Chen Luzhong while smiling said, \"Later on, you will know sometimes it is even harder to eat a shriveled fruit. As of now no one knows the exact strength of this poor old guy, if someone provokes me, hei hei........\"Chen Luzhong\u2019s laugh was extremely sinister, even Chen Xiang could not help but s.h.i.+ver. If you hid your strength, you could give your enemy a very nasty surprise, this was actually a very sinister move.Soon, Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong came inside a manor surrounded by high walls. This was the Southern Danxiang Herbal Manor. They entered a large two-storey building, inside they came to a place where dans were primarily sold.\"Brat, do not take things too far.\" Chen Luzhong said complainingly.Chen Xiang nodded his head and then shouted, \"SHOPKEEPER, QUICKLY ROLL OUT!\"Chen Xiang poured vigorous True Qi into his voice turning it into a roar, the whole building shook slightly due to the roar, everyone present inside was shocked. It was a surprise to them that someone came here to cause trouble, moreover it was just a teenager.The Danxiang Herbal Manor\u2019s business was generally good, but due to Chen Xiang's roar, everyone immediately went out and started watching the situation.Chen Xiang's roar disturbed all of the Danxiang Herbal Manor\u2019s personnel. A ton of bodyguards immediately rushed to the scene and surrounded Chen Xiang.These bodyguards were only at the 4th or 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, Chen Xiang could judge their strength from the slight True Qi emanating from their body. There were not many like Chen Xiang, who was already at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm strength at a relatively younger age. Therefore, Chen Xiang, compared to these bodyguards, was relatively strong.Chen Xiang looked around, there wasn\u2019t any trace of Chen Luzhong. Just a moment ago, Chen Luzhong blended into the crowd and had already arrived outside. It seemed that Chen Luzhong did not wish to make an appearance in this matter.\"Do you even know what this place is? You dare to rush here and make trouble!\"At last, one thirty years old or so handsome man came forward. He was wearing white luxurious clothes and an exquisite jade belt was hanging on his waist. With just one glance, everybody could guess his n.o.ble status.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Teach a lessonAlthough Chen Xiang\u2019s appearance was pretty simple, he looked like a teen who had just left his mother\u2019s embrace. But just from his roar alone, it was evidently clear to the bodyguards how powerful Chen Xiang was,,so they did not dare to move against him.\"You are the shopkeeper here?\"After hearing his words, all the bodyguards and the people watching from outside burst into laughter.\"You don\u2019t even know the shopkeeper and still came here to make trouble?\" One body guard said while laughing.\"You have not heard about shopkeeper Hua, right? You should have heard of the city\u2019s third young master! Our shopkeeper Hua is Governor Hua's third child, you are just seeking death by trying to provoke shopkeeper Hua!\" Another bodyguard said as he sneered.[TLN: Governor here is City lord (\u57ce\u4e3b)]After the Huafu wearing man heard people mention his name, his face could not help but reveal a sliver of pride, he nodded and said: \"I'm the shopkeeper of this place, Hua Xin, why have you come!\"[TLN: Huafu is a Chinese n.o.ble dress]\"Pooh!\"[TLN: spitting in contempt]Chen Xiang laughingly said: \"I don't give a s.h.i.+t! If you really had some skill, you would not even be here to be a shopkeeper by your father\u2019s arrangement, when you came here to be a shopkeeper, in your father's eyes, you were already deemed hopeless!\"This remark startled everyone, they did not expect Chen Xiang would dare to say something like this face to face! Hua Xin's complexion turned extremely ugly, Chen Xiang\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t far from the truth. As the son of one of the prominent figures capable of influencing one region, coming to this place and taking care of business really was nothing to be proud of, only the status was somewhat n.o.ble.\"I\u2019ll ask you again, was our store smashed by you and your people?\" Chen Xiang\u2019s complexion became incomparably cold.\"So what!\" One bodyguard with face full of anger said: \"Right, shopkeeper Hua took us there!\"Hua Xin\u2019s face muscles started to twitch: \"Turns out that you are here for revenge! Indeed it was I who brought people to that store.\"The crowd of bodyguards behind Hua Xin started to shout out about how they damaged the store.Chen Xiang coldly said: \"You are only a pack of dogs, if desired, your master will not even hesitate to sell you lackeys as slaves, what are you so happy about? Glad to have found a good master?!\"\"MONGREL, YOU SEEK DEATH!\" One bodyguard angrily cursed and already started to rush towards him, meanwhile, in Chen Xiang's hand, threatening hot flames suddenly appeared.A \"Pa!\" sound reverberated and immediately after that, painful screams were heard.Chen Xiang, with his True Qi, congealed out a long whip and struck the face of the bodyguard which then made the bodyguard fly away! A charred black mark was left on the face of the bodyguard.Seeing this, the group of bodyguards, although they were shocked, still rushed at him. After all, there were many of them while the opponent was only one.Chen Xiang said in a cold voice, \"Since you have already admitted to doing it, I have decided not to forgive you!\"Suddenly, a scorching hot Qi burst out from Chen Xiang\u2019s body before he fiercely started to wave the fire whip in his hand. He lashed continuously with a speed so fast that other\u2019s eyes could not even get a glimpse of it, it even produced numerous after images. For everyone, it was similar to Chen Xiang holding multiple whips and las.h.i.+ng at them.Limitless fire whips, that were like innumerable salamanders, overwhelmingly lashed towards the group of bodyguards! Hua Xin and his bunch couldn\u2019t even dodge, just in the blink of an eye, they were whipped innumerable times with the fire whip! The fire whip continued to lash at them with madness, las.h.i.+ng them on nearly every part of their body. This had left numerous charred black marks on them, burning them down to their marrow, making them yell due to the intermittent pain.In just a few moments, each person had at least three whip-marks.Releasing True Qi outside the body which created a form from it..One could clearly see that he was at the 6th level of mortal martial realm! Chen Xiang's True Qi was terribly vigorous, like a scorching hot breath with an invisible powerful pressure. Chen Xiang's flames were cultivated out by the [Vermillion Bird divine exercise], Vermillion Bird was a revered beast, and any ordinary person in the face of such invisible almighty pressure would quiver in fear.Hua Xin himself knew he had kicked an iron wall and unexpectedly annoyed a 6th level of mortal martial realm martial artist, but he remembered that earlier, the store only had a poor old man of an unknown origin.\"Danxiang Herbal Manor will not let you get away with this! Our Manor Lord is very powerful.\" Hua Xin, while grinding his teeth, spoke, but just as he finished speaking, a fire whip ruthlessly lashed on his mouth.At this point, Hua Xin had to admit that the martial artist in front of him was indeed very powerful, in just a short moment of time and a little effort, he hit them to the extent that they couldn\u2019t defend themselves anymore. Moreover, in their bodies, remnants of fire Qi were still left, if they fail to expel them out quickly, it will have huge effects on their future cultivation.\"Tell your manor lord, if he wants revenge, despite everything that has happened, he can come and find me in the store.\"Chen Xiang dropped these words and left, although there were some bodyguards still left unharmed outside, no one dared to stop him.After watching Chen Xiang leave, everyone present outside were slightly excited, they already started spreading rumours of what they saw.In the backyard of the store, Chen Luzhong laughingly said, \"Brat, you have not only offended the Danxiang Herbal Manor but also the King City governor, if I was you, I would have already left.\"Chen Xiang spoke with a contemptuous look, \"Granduncle, were you already aware that the shopkeeper was the King City's Governor's son? You disappeared in the blink of an eye.\"Chen Luzhong smiled and said, \"My old bones are not like you youngsters, I can\u2019t afford to act crazily, therefore, the following matter is for you to resolve! I'm only responsible for some leisure matters, that\u2019s all.\"Chen Xiang had been rus.h.i.+ng for several days, this time, he was very tired, so he wanted to rest well. Soon, he would have to face Danxiang Herbal Manor's lord and the King City Governor.Chen Xiang had already made some plans to deal with them, that's why he dared to hit the Governor's son. After all, in this world, the power of wealth was extremely powerful, of course, the true strength was still a lot stronger compared to the power of wealth.\"Chen Xiang, that Danxiang Herbal Manor is very likely to be a branch division of one of the sects.\" Su Meiyao appeared from inside the ring and spoke to Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang, at this time, was soaking in a bathtub. Su Meiyao\u2019s sudden appearance shocked him, before he spoke, \"Sister Meiyao, why didn't you say so earlier?\"Su Meiyao, while looking at Chen Xiang's exposed strong muscles, smiled charmingly: \"Rest a.s.sured, Danxiang Taoyuan is a friendly sect, moreover, they make a clear distinction between right and wrong, I believe that the Manor Lord will not find you for trouble.\"Chen Xiang let out a loose yet deep breath and smilingly said, \"Sister Meiyao, the water is still quite warm, come bathe with me!\"\"I'm going to let senior sister accompany you! Although she is icy, she very much likes taking hot baths.\" Su Meiyao chuckled as she spoke.Chen Xiang coughed twice and asked, \"Is Danxiang Taoyuan the name of the sect?\"Chen Xiang very much yearned to enter those big sects.Su Meiyao came next to the big tub and said, \"Among the eight major sects, Danxiang Taoyuan\u2019s expertise regarding pills even makes other sects jealous.\"\"Then wouldn\u2019t it be great for me to enter Danxiang Taoyuan? After all, it is an alchemy related sect.\"Su Meiyao shook her head: \"I don\u2019t recommend you doing that. As for alchemy, I can teach you. You should enter the Extreme Martial Sect, when it comes to strength of the sect, it is at the pinnacle of all the eight major sects. It\u2019s been founded for quite a number of years, and the first Dean of the Extreme Martial Sect is a legendary figure.\"To be able to enter those martial arts sects, Chen Xiang cultivated even more diligently, because he had to reach the 9th level of mortal martial realm before he could truly start his journey.[TLN: Danxiang Taoyuan(\u4e39\u9999\u6843\u6e90)= Pill Fragrance ParadiseExtreme martial sect (\u592a\u6b66\u95e8) = Tai Wu Men]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Manor Lord, GovernorChen Xiang had successfully refined three Baptizing Marrow Dans and placed them in his mouth, then immediately started to operate the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise]. While a.s.similating the potency of the pills, he also started to absorb the five elements of Qi in between the heaven and earth. Furthermore, he also casted the [Dragon Saliva Exercise], while creating the accelerating growth catalyst for the spirit herb in the due process, the 'Dragon Saliva'!The next morning, the sun had just started to rise and King City was already very noisy. The Danxiang Herbal Manor news had already been spread among the whole city. This was just a small issue and as long as n.o.body was killed, it was just a simple matter for the Governor. But yesterday, his own son was beaten. If the Governor wasn\u2019t going to intervene, then he would become a laughing stock to everyone.Therefore, the entrance of Chen Luzhong's store was already surrounded by many guards. On the avenue, two luxurious horse carriages were respectively driving directly towards the store.These luxurious horse carriage stopped just before the entrance of the store. There were many guards around the carriages but only one carriage belonged to the Danxiang Herbal Manor whereas the others belonged to the Governor. Both parties were here for the same purpose and that was to find Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang was still training in his room but with his keen senses, he was able to hear the commotion at the entrance. He immediately woke up and carefully listened to the voices.\"Manor Lord Hua, I did not expect that you would personally come here regarding my son's issue. I know my son has really caused trouble for you, but please do forgive him.\" From the black horse carriage, only a man's voice could be heard and this voice belonged to the famous Governor of the King City of the Southern Martial Empire, Hua Gaoyun.\"Well, your son this time brought a lot of troubles for the Danxiang Herbal Manor! I didn\u2019t come here for him, I came because I couldn\u2019t sit idly and do nothing while someone has come to trouble my Danxiang Herbal Manor.\"A sliver of anger could be felt in this beautiful voice. Chen Xiang couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. Danxiang Herbal Manor's lord turned out to be a girl!After tidying himself, Chen Xiang left his room through the backyard and entered the store inside where Chen Luzhong was already present.\"Grand Uncle, how come you didn't hide this time?\" Chen Xiang asked in a whisper. Meanwhile, he heard a knock.\"Shouldn't I worry about you brat? The Governor and Manor Lord are not people you can mess with.\"After opening the door Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong saw the bold and powerful soldiers standing outside. Of course, the most striking were the two horse carriages.\"What do you want?\" Chen Luzhong asked while laughing.From the two carriages inside, two people gott down. The one with the robust body was the Governor. He had a very small beard on his middle aged face, wearing a golden robe and adorned with s.h.i.+ny gold ornaments.The other was Danxiang Herbal Manor's Lord. A girl with a graceful figure and a gentle smile, wearing a blue skirt, face covered with a white muslin, revealing a pair of youthful and pretty eyes. When she saw Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong, those clear like water eyes suddenly glittered with a slight s.h.i.+mmer.\"Was it you who injured my son?\" Hua Gaoyun swept past Chen Xiang with his two eyes as he asked.\"Yes!\"On Chen Xiang's face there was no fear. Although he was facing two n.o.ble figures of King City, he was still very calm. He could see that Hua Gaoyun\u2019s strength had reached the 8th level of mortal martial realm. He was not only fearless, but also wanted to have a contest with him.At this time, a group of people from the crowd rushed out and pointed at Chen Xiang as they cursed. And it was evidently clear from their covered body in gauzes, these people were the bodyguards wounded by Chen Xiang at the manor\"Manor Lord, this is the guy who rushed into our Danxiang Herbal Manor and wounded us and the shopkeeper.\" One bodyguard while grimacing in pain said.Hua Gaoyun coldly smiled then turned to the Manor Lord and said, \"Now that it is confirmed, Manor Lord Hua, how do you say we dispose of him!?\"The next words of Manor Lord Hua made surprised everyone.\"The partakers who damaged this store are hereby expelled from the Danxiang Herbal Manor. Although the young master indeed caused trouble with our manor, but it was all because we Danxiang Herbal Manor\u2019s people were wrong earlier, therefore we are not investigating. Hua Yueyun, take this opportunity to apologize to the young master and also, the Danxiang Herbal Manor will compensate for the young masters losses.\"Danxiang Herbal Manor\u2019s lord went as far as to apologize to a person! Hua Gaoyun was not the only one who was shocked. Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong were also puzzled, but their impression of the Manor Lord had improved at this time. As Su Meiyao had said, this Danxiang Herbal Manor\u2019s lord is indeed a person with a clear distinction between right and wrong.\"Although Manor Lord Hua let you off, I will not do the same! Catch him. This person caused trouble in King City, and injured many people. Be sure to deal with him ruthlessly.\"Hua Gaoyun was not as easy as soft and gentle woman.Hua Yueyun slightly sighed and said, \"Governor Hua, these two present before your eyes are alchemist, are you really going to make enemy with alchemists?\"Hua Gaoyun was shocked, as well as those bodyguards and the soldiers too! That Young man and the old man before their eyes were alchemists, it should be known the ident.i.ty of alchemists were very rare in the Southern Martial Empire. Particularly the old alchemist, they were generally in a formidable family at a very high position and garnering respect. How would he appear here and moreover in such a poor condition?Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong from the start, never said a word. They calmly stood there, fearlessly.Chen Luzhong said: \"Governor Hua, this old man had bought this store many, many years before. Your son wanted to buy this from my hands, but I did not sell it so he took advantage of my absence and brought people to destroy it. If you don't believe me, you can go in and take a look!\"\"Mister, you should be the hall lord of Wohu City\u2019s Spirit Dan Hall and this young master must be the famous genius of the Chen family.\"Chen Family genius. Was he not the one who trounced against both the Yao family genius and elder? Famous throughout the whole Southern Martial Empire, Chen Xiang? He actually came to King City, moreover together with Spirit Dan Hall\u2019s lord. Everyone had long known that Spirit Dan Hall's lord was treated as ante and lost to the Chen family!\"Now, I am not a hall lord, just an old servant of this brat.\" Chen Luzhong laughed, but his words scared the h.e.l.l out of everybody.Spirit Dan Hall's lord was a relatively well-known figure in Southern Martial Empire and had now become a mere servant of someone. If they didn\u2019t hear this from his own mouth, people would never believe it.Hua Gaoyun eyebrows were continuously moving up and down. The other two were alchemists and he didn\u2019t think that his own idiot son would have a dispute with alchemists, that's definitely not a wise move.Chen Xiang looked at Hua Gaoyun and coldly said: \"Governor Hua, your son tried to seize our Chen family property. If it would have been someone else, I would have definitely slain him! You should know if one\u2019s family property is threatened, it is a very serious issue!\"Chen Xiang\u2019s words were filled with slaughter Qi, the majority of the crowd couldn\u2019t help but have s.h.i.+vers run down their spines. The Chen family wasn\u2019t a martial artist\u2019saristocratic family inside King City, but they still had inheritance from many years back, their profound heritage still could not be overlooked.Hua Gaoyun wrinkled his brows, his face filled with anger, yet he couldn\u2019t even attack. If he did so, he would have to consider the retaliation from the Chen family. Although his and the Yao family relations.h.i.+p was pretty good, it was only a relations.h.i.+p for mutual benefits.\"Let's go!\" Hua Gaoyun coldly shouted. He swallowed down the anger inside his heart and embarked on his carriage to leave.[TLN: There is no relation between the Governor and Manor Lord, their surname Hua are not the same, both have two different character and sound, Chinese is phonetic language so each character may seem similarly written but there sounds are different.Hua Gao Yun (\u534e\u9ad8\u4e91)=Hu\u00e1 G\u0101o Y\u00fanHua Yue Yun (\u82b1\u6708\u82b8)=Hu\u0101 Yu\u00e8 Y\u00fan]This Chapter was edited by A Simple Melody (An avid reader who helped me edit previous chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Sect\u2019s discipleHua Yueyun commanded some people to enter the store and estimate the damages, then said to Chen Xiang,\"If the two of you have some time, you can always come to Danxiang Herbal Manor as guests, we\u2019ll always welcome you two.\"After Hua Yueyun departed, Chen Luzhong held his waist and said while smiling \"You think this woman is interesting, right?\"Chen Xiang whispered while his s.h.i.+ning eyes were looking at the distant carriage, \"This woman schemes are very deep. I sense that she wants to win us over.\"\"You\u2019re over thinking Despite being a woman, she could still govern such a large pill force, she had long been accustomed to gnawing the bones till nothing was left. Why would she need to use any underhanded means to win us over?\"Five days quickly pa.s.sed. The store was brand new and was all done at no cost. Danxiang Herbal Manor had sent people to repair it and as long as there were enough pills and alchemists, the store would soon be open.Chen Xiang came to King city for two purposes. One was to start the pill store, and other was to partic.i.p.ate in the Martial Arts tournament of King City.King City's Martial Arts tournament had already begun accepting registrations. Although there were more than two months before it started, Chen Xiang had went to sign up early. Chen Xiang had also learnt some information along the way. Sect's disciple would indeed appear at the tournament, but they weren\u2019t going to partic.i.p.ate in it, rather, they were just here to observe.For several days, Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong were very busy refining pills. In order for the business to run smoothly, they had to refine a large number of pills.\"Granduncle, with just the two of us refining pills, this is not the way to go... I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to continue like this.\" Chen Xiang had just refined a Baptizing Marrow Dan, but the herbs he had to buy were from the Danxiang Herbal Manor.\"Young man, you think it is so easy to open up a store? If we don't have at least five alchemists, it\u2019ll be difficult to sustain. Even after opening the store, we\u2019d have to wait for the customers to come and buy. As I see it, it\u2019ll take at least two to three years before we can run smoothly.\" Chen Luzhong\u2019s reply made Chen Xiang stamp his feet anxiously, he couldn\u2019t wait for so long.In order to attract alchemists, he could only use some precious spirit herbs. Chen Xiang had planned to ripen a batch of herbs so he immediately left the alchemy room but when he arrived inside the store, he saw several people standing inside.These people were one old man and four handsome teenagers. The breath released from their bodies were very pure which give people a strange feeling. This kind of purest True Qi couldn\u2019t be cultivated out in the mortal world.\"You are.........\"\"HUMPH, YOU ARE CHEN XIANG?!\" That white haired old man shouted, his face both mighty and angry, and also those four teenagers had put on a high and mighty act while looking at Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang frowned, clenching his fist and said coldly, \"Right. Are you here to make trouble?\"At this time Chen Luzhong also came out, when he saw that old man he also froze for a moment, his body still trembling. Apparently he was very afraid of this old man.\"You.....you are......\" Chen Luzhong was speechless, he actually knew this old man.That old man spoke, \u201cRight, I am Chen Furong. Fifty years ago, I left the Chen family and entered a martial arts sect, and this time I came back to recruit some sect disciples but I heard some bad news.\"Chen Xiang was shocked inside his heart. This person responsible for recruiting sect disciple unexpectedly was one of the Chen family elders, but this elder seemed to be somewhat discontented with him.\"You dare to be enemies with the Yao family. You should know when I was inside the martial arts sect, the Yao family members had helped me a lot!\" Chen Furong glared at Chen Xiang, simultaneously, he released True Qi pressing towards Chen Xiang which made Chen Xiang suddenly feel as if his body weigh ten thousand jin.[TLN: Jin = Chinese measurement of weight, 1jin = 500g]Astonishment from Chen Luzhong\u2019s face had faded away and was replaced with coldness, \"He is the Chen families once in thousand years born rare good seedling, but you embarra.s.s him for your own selfish reason! This reason alone is enough for you not to have any qualification to be a member of the Chen family!\"When Chen Furong heard this statement, he restrained his breath, and looked at Chen Luzhong to determine his power level. As he was unable to see his power level, he contemptuously said: \"What good seed? This little devil? Just casually grab anyone inside my sect and they will be much stronger than him. My four apprentices behind me will be able to win very easily against him.\"Just as Chen Furong last words fell, Chen Xiang's stature moved similar to lightning. Azure aura started to surge into his fist, with flas.h.i.+ng lightning aura and carrying vigorous and tyrannical lightning power, struck towards the teenager.This sudden fierce attack left that teenager simply no time to dodge. His chest was ruthlessly hit by Chen Xiang's fist. Blood spilled from his mouth and was forced to retreat couple of steps before coming to a stop.\"Just so-so!\" Chen Xiang faintly said.He completely saw through Chen Furong, he now knew that the Chen family elder had no loyalty towards the Chen family. In order to befriend the Yao family, he was even dealing with his own clansman.Chen Xiang\u2019s sudden action made Chen Furong unceasingly shocked and angry. He had only heard of Chen Xiang's strength but never witnessed it, but now it seems it was indeed amazing, even capable of slightly injuring a martial arts sect disciple.\"This is the strength of a martial arts sect disciple?\" Chen Xiang said in contempt while glancing at the four teenagers, which in turn made the four teenager extremely furious.\"If you did not sneak attack me, you wouldn't even be able to touch me.\" The teenager while wiping his bloodstain mouth angrily retorted.\"So how about we have a little fight?\"Chen Xiang kneaded his fists, while on his face the intention to fight could be seen.\"Let's fight!\" The teenager's heart was filled with anger, only by fighting would he be able to vent his anger that resided in his heart.Chen Furong did not try to stop them, he retreated to one side blankly. This left a little s.p.a.ce open, at this time, the teenager and Chen Xiang both rushed towards each other.The teenager's steps were very light, it was similar to superficially treading only using the tip of the toes. Not only was it fast, but he carried himself with a strong momentum.\"Mortal martial realm level-6!\" Chen Xiang judged the teenagers strength immediately.The teenager saw Chen Xiang motionlessly standing there, his whole body full of openings. When he saw Chen Xiang trying to guard from his steps, he was secretly proud of himself. He leapt into the sky, both his feet continuously sent out flying kicks, suddenly, after images were overflowing from the top of the sky and surged towards Chen Xiang. Vigorous True Qi shook the air with a loud noise, obviously this teenagers kicking method was impressive.Chen Xiang didn\u2019t imagine this kind of attack and at that moment, he simply couldn\u2019t escape the countless leg shadows. He didn\u2019t think this little weak looking teenager would know such an overbearing kicking technique.\"Deng deng deng\"Chen Xiang\u2019s body in a blink of an eye flew and kicked a dozens of times. Afterwards, he fell on top of a wooden table which destroyed it immediately.\"Humph! You are also just so-so!\" The teenager in said in disdain. Just as he finished, Chen Xiang jumped into the sky and stood straight, beating his clothes like nothing ever happened.The teenagers as well as Chen Furong were completely astonished.\"You.....I truly kicked your body a moment ago, but how can you afford to withstand my powerful True Qi? I had at least kicked your body ten or so times, on each kick I poured very powerful True Qi.\" That teenager with a serious complexion said. Only few people among the same level were capable of remaining safely unharmed under his kicking method.Chen Xiang lightly smiled and said, \"That move of yours was really good, but it was still average!\"While speaking, Chen Xiang dashed towards the teenager and with his fists, strikes similar to giant axe cutting mountains, were continuously struck out. Every fist strike had momentum similar to a giant river\u2019s flow, bursting out a flurry of explosions. Each fist transformed into ferocious tiger heads, shocking the air, as if ferocious tigers were roaring in anger.Uninterrupted and quick, Chen Xiang's fist made countless afterimages similar to violent storm striking towards the teenage. The reaction of the teenager was very quick. Wind revolved around his body before it was covered in a layer of golden brilliance, which was metal attribute True Qi and he released a True Qi cover to protect himself.Edited by - A Simple MelodyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Hua YueyunThe teenagers True Qi s.h.i.+eld was also very intrepid, as it was even able to withstand Chen Xiang's crazy lightning fist strikes. Even so, Chen Xiang still didn\u2019t pay any attention to it. Suddenly a trace of fiery red Qi started to mix with his green True Qi.Till now Chen Xiang was only using wood attributed Azure Dragon True Qi, but now he started to add fire attributed Zhu Que True Qi. As both True Qi fused and superimposed on each other, their combined might was more than just double.Chen Furong\u2019s pupils\u2019 contracted as Chen Xiang's True Qi colour changed because one person possessing two types of True Qi was rarely seen!The golden True Qi s.h.i.+eld covering the teenager's body slightly vibrated before Chen Xiang's fists shook his firm True Qi s.h.i.+eld.Chen Xiang's fists, with an explosive roar, suddenly gushed out scorching hot flames with lightning blowing inside the flames. An all around powerful and oppressive aura like wave violently surged, completely shaking everything.Chen Xiang's fists bombarded again while lightning and fire were flas.h.i.+ng inside.\"Hong hong hong................\"Chen Xiang's fist were quick as always. In a blink of an eye, tens of fists struck on the teenager's golden True Qi s.h.i.+eld sending out thunderous roars. Loudly shaking the ground, and soon after, spreading to the whole pavilion in all four directions.With madness, continuously striking out fist while bursting continuous roars, watching this level of crazy attack, Chen Luzhong Chen Furong, as well as those teenagers watching were in awe. They did not think that the young Chen Xiang's True Qi was vigorous to this degree, madly able to cast out such fierce True Qi attacks.The golden Qi s.h.i.+eld covering the teenager\u2019s body covered already started to dim down. He was beaten back by Chen Xiang, and his body was numbing in pain as his golden True Qi s.h.i.+eld was shaken by Chen Xiang's crazy fist strength.\"Break!\" Chen Xiang heavily shouted. While jumping, on his fists lightning and fire burst out as they struck towards the teenager's body like a meteor. Directly breaking the teenager\u2019s golden Qi, the teenager flew out and crashed through the wall falling on the avenue outside as a mouthful of blood surged out before he fainted.Chen Xiang's gaze swept past the other teenagers and coldly shouted, \"Would you also like to come?\"The three teenagers couldn\u2019t even speak. At this time,they were unable to calm down. Fear was clearly visible on their face. The level of slaughter Qi emitted by Chen Xiang was similar to a Great General who was perennial engaged in slaughtering.\"Let's go!\" Chen Furong was speechless. Chen Xiang's strength also made him deeply shocked, he could see Chen Xiang's martial skill was very strong and frightening.\"Wait, he is one of the big sect's disciple. Although we exchanged some pointers, as I was not careful and wounded him, I have to heal him to avoid the jealousy and hatred of the sect.\"Immediately after Chen Xiang took out an alchemy furnace, he sat down cross-legged while taking out some spirit herbs from his storage pouch.Chen Xiang actually wanted to refine a pill!\"Certainly you can directly heal him. Why bother!\" Chen Furong impa.s.sively said.Chen Xiang while sneering said, \"You can try and see if ordinary pills will heal him. He was injured by my fire and lighting True Qi. If he doesn\u2019t have the corresponding pill, his wounds will have a hard time healing.\u201dAfter speaking, Chen Xiang began to pour flames inside the furnace, meanwhile Chen Furong carried the teenager from the avenue. He determined that the teenager was seriously injured as he probed the wounds. Moreover, lighting and fire Qi had entered the body from the wounds, and these lighting and fire were not common lightning and fire.Half an hour pa.s.sed. Chen Furong and his apprentices had been silent, patiently waiting, and they also wanted to take a look at Chen Xiang's alchemy technique.Chen Xiang opened the furnace lid while a pill aroma wafted out. It only took half an hour to refine the healing pill! This was too d.a.m.n fast! This made Chen Furong and the three teenagers extremely scared.\"This is a Great Rejuvenating Dan, Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dan!\" Chen Xiang handed out a pink dan to Chen Furong. He did this so that the Chen family senior wouldn't hate him as well as change Chen Furong\u2019s opinion about him.Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dan! Chen Xiang only took half an hour to refine it! As Chen Furong received the dan, he immediately determined that it was genuine. At this time, he had to admit that Chen Xiang was someone with an immeasurable future.\"Do you want to start a business by selling dans? Here, there is not only the Danxiang Herbal Manor, but also the Yao family. With just the two of you refining pills, this store will surely fail! This idea is simply too naive, I will make the Chen family stop you. This is simply a waste of money! Chen Xiang here is a tip, it is best if you go and apologize to the Yao family!\"Chen Furong after dropping this sentence, left with the teenagers.With Chen Furong gone, Chen Luzhong said with a sigh, \"This guy has always been very selfish, therefore he left the Chen family a long time ago. I simply did not imagine that he would have received the Yao family\u2019s grace and actually came here to deal with his own clan member. If your grandfather was here, he would have punished him.\"Chen Xiang asked as he cleaned the floor, \"Granduncle, great sect's disciple all have this level of strength?\"Chen Luzhong shook his head and said: \"They are just Outer Sect disciples. If it would have been an Inner Sect disciple or a True Disciple, then you would simply have no chance of winning! Chen Furong should have a relatively high position among outer sect's disciple.\"Chen Xiang was shocked. He had estimated that Chen Furong\u2019s strength was at least at the 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm, and he was only an Outer Sect disciple! Then what is the level of Inner Sect and True Disciples?\"I have to go look and hire some alchemists.\" Chen Xiang said. He already had some plans about how to proceed.\"Most of the alchemists inside the King City have already joined other forces. In order to find some will be somewhat difficult.\" Chen Luzhong sighed because alchemists were very rare and so, many forces fought over them.Chen Xiang said while he rolled his eyes: \"I have to go to Danxiang Herbal Manor. I\u2019ll look for that woman to discuss about some business.\"Soon after Chen Xiang put down the broom, he ran out of the store towards the biggest Danxiang Herbal Manor located in the central region of the King City. This was also the headquarters of all the Danxiang Herbal Manor located in King City.The Danxiang Herbal Manor headquarters was a giant manor. Chen Xiang entered inside while indicating his ident.i.ty. Immediately after, he was received with warm welcome. One maid took him through many halls and courtyards inside the manor eventually coming to a colourful and gorgeous garden, and amidst the garden was a small house.The aroma wafting from the flower beds made Chen Xiang feel somewhat refreshed. Then from inside the house, came an enchanting and gentle voice, \"Young master Chen , please come in! I knew you would come visit.\"An attractive laughter sounded out and Hua Yueyun words slightly stunned Chen Xiang. In his heart, he subtly cursed 'vixen', then pulled himself together and walked forward.Chen Xiang came to a small hall full of exquisite aroma. Inside the hut he saw an enchanting woman with a graceful posture and beautiful appearance was preparing some tea leaves.Previously, Hua Yueyun had covered her face with a veil so Chen Xiang wasn't able to see her face, but now that he saw. It was much more beautiful than he had imagined but this time, she was wearing a white transparent gauze skirt. You could partly see her jade lotus like arms, as well as her sultry and slender legs. Her pretty waist was visible through her thin veil, as well as her milk white ample bosom with a deep ravine.This was b.u.t.t naked temptation. If Chen Xiang didn\u2019t have extremely good control over his mind against stunning beauties, he probably would have already been under their control. This left him puzzled about why such a stunning figure was here.Edited By: A Simple MelodyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: TemptationHua Yueyun\u2019s little red mouth was slightly stretched before she took a sip of the petal tea. Seemingly speechless and enchanted, with a sweet smile hanging on her face, she said to Chen Xiang, \"Young master, what say we get down to business over a cup of tea.\"Chen Xiang touched his nose, he suddenly felt a little embarra.s.sed, because he just had a martial art contest with someone. Moreover, he had also refined a set of herbs of the Great Rejuvenating Dan, so he was more or less covered in sweat and dressed very sloppy.He smiled and said, \"Manor Lord Hua, compared to the beauties outside, you are much more beautiful, and I just do not understand why would Manor Lord Hua be so warm towards me. This pa.s.sion truly made me feel very hot ah!\"Finished speaking, Chen Xiang cursed 'Yaojing' in his heart. Soon after, a fire secretly started burning in his lower abdomen.[TLN: Yaojing (\u5996\u7cbe) = alluring woman or evil spirit who is enchanting and beautiful.]Although on the surface, he was calm, he was actually very restless in his heart. He had seen Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao\u2019s jade like body before, and also had intimate contacts with the little fairy like soft refined dust*, Xue Xianxian. Moreover, he had also seen the remarkably graceful Empress of the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire. He had to admit that the Hua Yueyun in front of him was indeed like lilies and roses, and that her appearance was comparable to the several beauties he had seen.[TLN: soft refined dust (\u8f7b\u5c18\u8131\u4fd7) I just translated as written but in Chinese it is used to describe a woman in elegant way who is pure and not tainted by any other worldly things. (Not that kind which you are thinking more in good way. :)]\"Young master already has Xue Xianxian, that talented little fairy. How could you think highly of this little miss?\" Hua Yueyun pretended to be self-deprecating and on her pretty face a trace of envy was visible.Chen Xiang no longer excessively looked at this beautiful woman. He drank a cup of petal tea and said, \"Manor Lord Hua, let's get to the point. I want to dispose a Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, and I think that Manor Lord Hua should give me a satisfactory price!\"When Hua Yueyun heard this, she no longer s.e.xually hara.s.sed this innocent young boy. She sat down and poured him more tea and said, \"You caught me by surprise. This is a thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, and you are an alchemist. Is it that you don\u2019t know how precious it is? If young master is short on money, then this little miss can lend you some first.\"Chen Xiang was surprised in his heart. He wasn\u2019t clear about why he got her favour. How was he able to make such a mature, stunning beauty act so intimately with him, even lend him some money.\"This woman\u2019s schemes are very heavy, I have to be careful.\" Chen Xiang fully realized that the truth was anything but gallant.\"No, I don\u2019t want to owe anybody. If Manor Lord Hua is not willing, then I will find someone else.\" Chen Xiang stood up. He did not want to get enticed by this woman again, after all, this was not good for him.Hua Yueyun sighed lightly, sipped the tea while looking dejected, faintly said, \"While in the eyes of others I'm a superior manor lord, but my real ident.i.ty is nothing but a maidservant of the Danxiang Taoyuan. Just because I was comparatively more beautiful and a little clever, I was sent here to a.s.sume control of the Danxiang Herbal Manor.\"So this girl, as beautiful as a heavenly immortal was just a maidservant! For Chen Xiang it was implausible.\"Young master Chen , you are but a rare genius, whether it is strength or alchemy, both are inherent. Even in martial arts sects, it would be very difficult to find someone like you! I want to say openly, I want to pull you into the Danxiang Taoyuan. That way I can obtain rewards from the Danxiang Taoyuan, and you can leave this d.a.m.ned place with meager Spirit Qi.\" Hua Yueyun grumbled tenderly and pitifully looking at Chen Xiang.One martial arts sect recruiting a good seedling. For a sect, that was a good thing but Chen Xiang felt somewhat uncertain, \"You mean, after you enroll me into the Danxiang Taoyuan, you will gain some benefits? You do not look like a maidservant, I sense your strength to be at least at 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm!\"Hua Yueyun was slightly taken back, \"Young master Chen has good eyes. To tell you the truth, after entering the Danxiang Taoyuan, I\u2019ll only get the reward once you become a True Disciple, because, many geniuses are unable to enter the True Martial Realm. I\u2019ve personally seen many of those geniuses.\"Chen Xiang said with a smirk, \"You have been fooling a lot of people!\"Hua Yueyun pouted her little mouth, \"I\u2019ve never lied to them, which is why they voluntarily went to the Danxiang Taoyuan. Moreover, it was not harmful for them.\"Chen Xiang shook his head and said, \"I do not want to enter the Danxiang Taoyuan, I want to enter the Extreme Martial Sect!\"Hua Yueyun said with contempt, \"Extreme Martial Sect? Young master Chen, you know amongst the eight major faction, the Extreme Martial Sect is the most difficult to enter. Extreme Martial Sect, no matter how talented you are, as long you cannot pa.s.s through their tests, you will be rejected from the gate!\"Chen Xiang gaze became sharp, said, \"This is challenging!\"Hua Yueyun wrinkled her nose and with an angry 'humph' said, \"Fool, you\u2019ve me leading you into the Danxiang Taoyuan and you don\u2019t want to enter, you\u2019re h.e.l.l bent going into that b.l.o.o.d.y Extreme Martial Sect. You\u2019re going to regret it later!\"\"Regretting is still my issue, thanks for Manor Lord Hua\u2019s concern!\" Chen Xiang slightly smiled to her.Hua Yueyun nibbled her red lip, looking at Chen Xiang with resentment, she murmured, \"Don\u2019t call me something like Manor Lord Hua, I'm just a maidservant.I cannot stand this t.i.tle. Since you know who I am, don\u2019t be so flattering.........just call me Yueyun, or I will not sell any dans to your Chen Family.\"Just a moment ago, she could eternally enthrall someone with her peerless charm, and now, she turned into an angry little girl which made Chen Xiang laugh involuntarily, \"Yueyun, now can we talk about that thousand year old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s?\"Hua Yueyun drank two cups of tea, and after dispersing the anger in her heart, she said, \"Chen Xiang, since you insist on selling, I'll not urge you! You're really a fool. Not only do you want to sell this precious spirit herb, but you also want to reject my invitation to enter the Danxiang Taoyuan....Xue Xianxian, this heavenly pampered daughter, why does she fancy an idiot like you?\"Speaking of which, Hua Yueyun\u2019s pretty face full of anger had a totally different kind of charm. Looking at her, Chen Xiang secretly admired her in his heart. If Hua Yueyun came to know about this, she would certainly fly into a rage.\"If you are in urgent need of money, if you want, I can lend you some. Although I'm just a maidservant, I have a lot of spirit coins and I can also freely mobilise spirit coins of the Danxiang Herbal Manor.\"\"Woman, you're getting really long-winded. Give me a price! I don\u2019t want to owe you.\" said Chen Xiang while curling his lips..Hua Yueyun spat and said, \"Four hundred thousand spirit coins.\"Chen Xiang was satisfied with this price. He nodded and said, \"And I would also like to buy some of the spirit herbs.\"Chen Xiang took out a list as well as the thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s. Hua Yueyun sighed after taking the thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s, \"If you enter the Danxiang Taoyuan and become a True Disciple, I can be your maidservant...at that time I will be yours forever.\"Chen Xiang's eyebrows rose. That was a very big temptation, but he refused, \"Xianxian, this little girl will be jealous.\"Hua Yueyun stuck her tongue out and said, \"Talking to this fool is like talking to a dead person. Wait for my return.\"Looking at that writhing charming waist of Hua Yueyun as she left, Chen Xiang let out a deep breath. This time Su Meiyao laughingly said, \"This is a formidable little Yaojing! If she is capable of making you a True Disciple, that is indeed a very good thing! You should know that inside those martial arts sects, a True Disciple\u2019s status is very high.\"\"Why?\"Bai Youyou said, \"Simple, because True Disciples are in or above True Martial Realm. Although those martial sects are very big and have numerous disciples, True Disciples are not many, and True Disciples basically represent the strength of the whole sect.\"Translated by XianXiaWorldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Metal Spirit FruitAt this point, Chen Xian wanted more and more to experience what it felt like to be in a sect. But, even those who were in the 8th and 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm were only Outer Sect\u2019s disciples. From this, it was clear how compet.i.tive it was, let alone to enter the Extreme Martial Sect.\"Extreme Martial Sect has really harsh conditions, can I even become a true disciple?\" Chen Xiang muttered.\"Sure, you have Yin and Yang divine veins, and being personally taught by us two sisters, as long as you work hard, in the future you will definitely become strong enough to even reign over an entire region.\" Bai Youyou said resolutely and decisively, as she was very confident in Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang waited for a while, before Hua Yueyun returned. This time, she wore a purple robe and skirt, not like before, as she was now looming with temptation, which made Chen Xiang feel somewhat disappointed.\"These are the things that you wanted along with the leftover spirit coins.\" Hua Yueyun placed the spirit coins and some herbs wrapped in paper on the table.Chen Xiang didn\u2019t bother checking and directly received them inside his storage pouch, thus showing his trust in Hua Yueyun, which made Hua Yueyun secretly happy in her heart.\"Have you registered to partic.i.p.ate in King City\u2019s martial arts tournament? This Southern Martial Empire is under the jurisdiction of the True Martial Sect forces.\" Hua Yueyun asked because she was obviously concerned about Chen Xiang.After some thinking, Chen Xiang said, \"I will partic.i.p.ate, but I\u2019m not going to join the True Martial Sect. I\u2019m just partic.i.p.ating for the True Elemental Dan!\"Looking at Chen Xiang leaving, Hua Yueyun shook her head and lightly sighed, disappointment was evident in her pretty eyes. Previously, she was able to make this kind of callow teenager submit to her with just a few words. However, now, not only did she talk a lot, she was also rather enticing while she spoke. Yet, in the end, she still wasn\u2019t able to persuade Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang sold the thousand year Blood Spirit Gra.s.s for four hundred thousand spirit coins, and then with a hundred thousand spirit coins, purchased a lot of mature spirit herbs. Among these spirit herbs, the most precious of all was the Metal Spirit Fruit's seed.[TLN: here in the end I translated as seed but the actual translation would be fruit nuclei (\u679c\u6838) well basically seed. :)]Metal Spirit Fruit was a high-grade profound level spirit fruit, and was as precious as the Thousand Vein Fruit. Reportedly, it would only appear once every thousand years. Whether it was the pulp or the peel, they were of great usage, especially in refining high\u2013grade dans. Adding some of it during the refining could allow an increase of the quality of the dans, and also increasing the chance of congealing the dans.Chen Xiang had just purchased a Metal Spirit Fruit\u2019s seed, and it would be used for planting a Metal Spirit Tree. The seed was also used in alchemy, but no one had ever thought of growing a tree from it, because it needed an exceedingly long time to grow. Even if someone were to grow one, they\u2019d still have to wait a thousand years, before the tree would bear a fruit for the first time.But this wasn\u2019t the same for Chen Xiang. These days, he had acc.u.mulated a lot of Dragon Saliva. Continually irrigating the seed with it, he would be able to produce the Metal Spirit Fruit quickly.Chen Xiang was in the small courtyard. He planted the seed, before he took out a jade bottle filled with the Dragon Saliva. Now he needed to nurture the seed, so there was no need to dilute the Dragon Saliva with water. He just had to directly drip it on the Metal Spirit Fruit\u2019s seed inside the soil.Just as he poured a drop, a large amount of Spirit Qi suddenly surged and permeated into the soil. Immediately after, a small bud grew out. After seeing that it was this effective, Chen Xiang continued dripping the Dragon Saliva on the soil.With each drop, a large amount of Spirit Qi violently surged deep into the ground leading into the Metal Spirit Fruit\u2019s seed inside. The Dragon Saliva itself contained an abundant life force, and now, it would allow the small tree to absorb a large amount of Spirit Qi, which would accelerate its growth.Chen Xiang now understood why Su Meiyao had always repeatedly urged him not to reveal anything about the [Dragon Saliva Exercise]. Otherwise, it would be very troublesome. It was only now, that he deeply felt the formability of this heaven defying divine exercise. His heart grew more and more excited. Give him some time, and even growing a ten thousand year old spirit herb, would be like taking a walk in the park!After exhausting a bottle of the Dragon Saliva, the Metal Spirit Fruit\u2019s seed had grown into a human sized small tree; this was only in half a day worth of time!\"Ugh, there\u2019s still no fruit!\" Chen Xiang complained as he was somewhat dissatisfied.- Humph! -\"You should be content. If it was under normal circ.u.mstances, it would have taken at least five hundred years to grow into this size. You will need to collect at least one more month worth of Dragon Saliva to allow this tree to bear fruit.\"As long as it bore a fruit, Chen Xiang would be able to grow several Metal Spirit Fruits. At that time he would announce this to the entire nation: \u2018Recruiting alchemists, with Metal Spirit Fruit as a reward\u2019. With such an easy task, it might even lead to a dogfight between the alchemists.\"Brat, you should now start collecting herbs for refining a Building Foundation Dan. You have Yin and Yang divine veins and cultivate divine exercises, so entering into the True Martial Realm is not a problem, but if you want it to be fast and stable, this dan is a must!\" Bai Youyou said.Building Foundation Dan, a Low-Grade Profound Level Dan, mainly used for a stable foundation and enhancing the body. It also increased the purity of True Qi, and if taken before entering the True Martial Realm, advancing would be much easier.Chen Xiang, while curling his lips, said, \"I can only refine Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dan, but Profound Level Dan... ya! Even when I'm at the peak of Mortal Martial Realm, I'm afraid I still wouldn\u2019t have the ability to refine it!\"\"Ignorant little devil, as long as you\u2019re able to refine a High-Grade Spirit Level Dan, you\u2019ll be able to refine the Building Foundation Dan! Only because the herbs of the Building Foundation Dan are very rare, it is categorised as a profound level Dan. But, the difficulty of refining it isn\u2019t all that great. Humph!\" Bai Youyou said coldly.Chen Xiang now had the Thousand Vein Fruit and also a thousand year Beast Dan. With these three rare spirit herbs, refining the Building Foundation Dan was possible. Because he practiced [Dragon Saliva Exercise], as long as he had a seed, he could infinitely grow the spirit herbs. At that time, he could have as many Building Foundation Dan as he wanted. Buying the seeds wouldn\u2019t be an issue, since the Building Foundation Dan could be sold for many spirit coins.Thinking of this point, Chen Xiang was extremely excited. Of course presently he had to elevate his strength. With stronger strength, came also an increase in the ripening of the Dragon Saliva, moreover refining high-grade dans required stronger flames.At night, Chen Xiang disguised himself and left King City. He went to a distant mountain forest, with relatively dense True Qi, which would allow him to speed up his cultivation.Chen Xiang closed his eyes, and with the help of his Yin and Yang divine veins, he sensed the rich Spirit Qi within a radius of tens of Li. When he operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], the Spirit Qi immediately surged into his body. Chen Xiang then refined them into five-element True Qi, compressing and storing them in the five locations inside his dantian.Before dawn, Chen Xiang had already woken up. Cultivating in a place with rich Spirit Qi, not only would it allow him to cultivate more True Qi, it would also help him in gathering more Dragon Saliva. This was also one of the reason he came to these outskirts.Chen Xiang was as energetic as a dragon and as fierce as a tiger. Suddenly, in the middle of the forest, he started boxing. In this dim forest, criss-crossing green and red light constantly flashed, transforming into tiger heads, striking out at the empty air, while bursting out roars. Each of his fists emitted fierce winds, while the soil on the ground was curled up like the waves of the sea. Intermittent sounds bursted out as his fists struck the trees, while dismembering the trees, which could be encircled by two people, in the process.This was the high-grade spirit level martial skill [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]. Chen Xiang had the [Divine Exercise Of Four Symbols], but presently he could only learn some of the common martial techniques, although its power was good, it was still insufficient.Only if one was familiar in casting martial techniques would it be useful during a battle. By now, Chen Xiang was able to smoothly perform the [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]. He now felt pleasure in releasing the vigorous True Qi from his body, while casting the martial techniques. As he struck out, his vigorous True Qi transformed into a formidable and ingenious power, which also made him feel more comfortable.Many trees broke as his punches landed on them, one by one, blasting them off from the ground and forming many pits, Chen Xiang sighed as he thought. He was only at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and had this level of strength. An ordinary person, in his eyes, were already similar to ants, as even for someone at the same level, it would be difficult for them to resist his violent [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist].\"If I enter into the True Martial realm, how powerful will I be?\" When Chen Xiang thought about this, his mind couldn\u2019t help but surge with an inexplicable excitement. He had a very strong desire for more and more power, which boosted his morale.Translated by XianXiaWorldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: In front of the Yao FamilyChen Xiang returned just before dawn. During the day, he madly refined dans. While during night, he went to the outskirts of the city to cultivate. Twenty days of this cycle continued. Now, not only had his cultivation enhanced by a lot, he also became very skillful in refining Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans and below, with almost no chance of failure. The time required for the entire alchemy process was also shortened by a large amount, it was to the point that even the old alchemist Chen Luzhong felt completely embarra.s.sed of his own inferiority.Seventy to eighty percent of the money acquired from selling the Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s had already been spent. Chen Xiang and Chen Luzhong had refined many commonly used Low-Grade Mortal Level Dans, but it was still far from enough.Of course, the Metal Spirit Tree planted by Chen Xiang, was also about to bear fruits! In these past twenty days, he had been constantly producing Dragon Saliva and accelerating its growth. This was the first time he had stimulated the growth of a single type of spirit herb for such a long time, but it would definitely be worth it.The Metal Spirit Tree was his confidential secret, which was why he had planted it in his own private courtyard. Even Chen Luzhong wasn\u2019t allowed to casually enter Chen Xiang\u2019s small courtyard.\u201cAs long as we hire enough alchemists, I can be carefree and gain some breathing room!\u201d Chen Xiang was stroking a small golden fruit, which was birthed out from the tree this very morning after he nourished it with the Dragon Saliva.Chen Xiang hadn\u2019t ever thought of just refining and selling dans all day. He aspired to do much grander things, such as finding precious spirit herbs, killing demon beasts, acquiring and practicing suitable martial techniques, or even just to explore this vast world.At this moment, the King City\u2019s Martial Arts Tournament was only a month away and Chen Xiang went to sign up for it. However, what made him depressed was the fact that the King City\u2019s Martial Arts Tournament was unexpectedly hosted by the Yao Family, and due to this, the registration venue was inside the Yao Family area.Chen Xiang had been lodging in King City for quite some time now, and had already heard people discussing about the missing Yao Tianhua and the Yao Family Elder. But fortunately for Chen Xiang, there were a few wicked organisations of formidable martial artists organisations that frequently wrought havoc outside King City. They looted and killed many of King City\u2019s children from aristocrat families, so Chen Xiang was never suspected of the deed.That being said, the whole Yao Family was furious as their Yao Family genius and an elder had gone missing. They denounced those evil forces with the help of the Imperial Family, along with many other families with whom they had good relations with. In just a few days, many of the evil forces had been punished or completely destroyed, yet despite all this, the Yao Family wasn\u2019t able to find any clue to the whereabouts of Yao Tianhua.In reality, Yao Tianhua and the Yao Family Elder had long been killed by Chen Xiang, their bodies incinerated until only ashes remained. The Yao Family finding out what happened was the least of Chen Xiang\u2019s worries.Currently, Chen Xiang had just arrived at the Yao Family residence, which to no surprise, was very large. In his heart, Chen Xiang was slightly in awe from just seeing the entrance, let alone inside!The compet.i.tion, as well as registrations, was being held in the huge field in front of the Yao Family entrance. Although registrations had started early, a vast majority of people were still coming every day to register. The whole field was very lively, many long queues stretched out like a dragon.Chen Xiang had lined up quite a while ago, and now, he finally stood in front of the registration table. The young, twenty or so, man responsible for registrations yawned and picked up his pen and paper. He lazily asked, \u201cName?\u201d\"Chen Xiang!\"The young man was originally listless, but after hearing these two words, he became wide awake while carefully sizing up Chen Xiang. Everyone around them also looked over! Chen Xiang\u2019s name was well-known to everyone here. Not only was he capable of refining the Baptizing Marrow Dan, but his strength was known to be comparable to someone in the 7th Level of the Mortal Marital Realm! He had wounded the Yao Family Elder, beat up the governor\u2019s son, and gained the favour of the manor lord of Danxiang Herbal Manor, who was considered the most beautiful woman in the city! These were only some of his more notable deeds.Chen Xiang was also a genius level figure comparable to Yao Tianhua. As long as one walked around the city before, they would have surely heard of his name. However, the Yao Family thought of him as nothing but a thorn in their eyes, every single Yao Family member pretty much hated him. For them, Chen Xiang injuring the Yao Family Elder and Yao Tianhua was the only reason they had gone missing. If not for the Yao Family Elder\u2019s injuries, there was no way they could possibly have been in any kind of danger.\u201cGo over there and take the strength test. Only after pa.s.sing the test will you be able to partic.i.p.ate in the Martial Arts Tournament.\u201d That young man pointed to another row.Before coming here, Chen Xiang had heard that they tested your strength before successful registration. Those who were not able to pa.s.s the test would be unable to partic.i.p.ate.After the young man placed a seal on a paper, Chen Xiang took the paper and headed towards the other row.Chen Xiang was actually this close to them, just thinking about this, many people were extremely excited. An alchemist, as well as the grandson of the famous Chen Family Patriarch. He had a limitless future, which made many people take initiative to chat with him.To pa.s.s some time, Chen Xiang was also happy to chat with the other family juniors. While many of the family juniors tried to get on his good side to get the Chen Family\u2019s support for their families, some feared offending the Yao Family and were afraid to form an alliance with the Chen Family. However, these family juniors came to learn from Chen Xiang that Chen Family also had a dan shop, so they would be less wary of the threat posed by the Yao Family.Unknowingly, time pa.s.sed by quickly and it was now Chen Xiang\u2019s turn. The method to test one\u2019s strength was simple, you just had to strike a strange boulder. Originally, this boulder was black, but if one\u2019s power was strong enough, they would be able to change it's color.Chen Xiang was standing in front of the boulder, which was taller than him! The person in charge of the testing site announced, \u201cAs long as you are able to turn this boulder\u2019s colour to yellow, you will pa.s.s this test.\u201dAccording to the force exerted, the boulder would change it\u2019s colour from black to red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, or purple, with purple being the highest amount of force it could measure.Since standing in line, Chen Xiang had seen many people change the boulder\u2019s colour to red, sometimes even orange, but no one was still able to change it\u2019s color to yellow.\u201cI heard that during the Crown Prince\u2019s test, the stone turned blue. Ah, truly unfathomable strength!\u201d\u201cOh, I also heard that one of the Yao Family\u2019s juniors was very formidable and also turned the stone blue.\u201d\u201cHa, just that? The Great General Leng\u2019s daughter was able to change it to purple!\u201d\u201c...\u201dChen Xiang suddenly heard many people discussing about the strength of some notable figures. At this time, everyone seemed to be watching him with rapt attention, awaiting his results. Everyone wanted to take a look at Chen Xiang and see if his strength was truly as mighty as they heard, or if it was just a baseless rumor. Many of those present had never seen Chen Xiang\u2019s strength.Chen Xiang rubbed his fists as he stared at the boulder. The Chen Family also had this sort of boulder, albeit a little smaller than this, it was still equally good for determining power. It was very painful to hit it, in fact, Chen Xiang had tried this test a long time ago at home. However, at that time he was barely able to turn the stone\u2019s hue into a faint red, denoting his former power to be weak.However, things had changed and now Chen Xiang had reached the 6th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm! He was very eager to test out his strength.After some preparation, Chen Xiang slightly inhaled. He operated the Vermillion Bird and Azure Dragon True Qi within his dantian and integrated them together. As the two True Qis fused together and surged into his arms, his sleeves suddenly turned into ash revealing blue veins on his stout arm.At this time, everyone around the testing site had turned quiet. The people closer to Chen Xiang were even able to sense his frightening amount of True Qi. After this sudden show of explosive might, the crowd was in awe. At this moment, n.o.body doubted that Chen Xiang had injured the Yao Family Elder. The entire crowd was panic stricken just from the mighty pressure released by Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi!In one go, the dual attributed True Qi surged into Chen Xiang\u2019s arm. Tightening his fist, he punched out! Violent and fast as lighting, his fist ruthlessly slammed onto the boulder.\u2018BANG!\u2019That boulder suddenly shattered into many pieces and scattered on the ground, soot flew everywhere following outburst of True Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37:Generous RemunerationEdited by:CloudGoatEveryone stared blankly, originally they thought that the stone would just turn purple, but now Chen Xiang\u2019s fists blasted it into smithereens, not even the Strength measuring stone was able to bear his violent power.Before there were those who turned the strength measuring stone into either blue or purple, and they were already considered leaders of the younger generation.But now Chen Xiang smashed the Strength measuring stone, obviously Chen Xiang\u2019s strength lad already surpa.s.sed those people!Chen Xiang was shocked with his own result, but now since he has broken the Strength measuring stone, he feared that the Yao family would ask for compensation.\"Did........did I pa.s.s?I did not intend to smash it, I just wanted to use the strongest power for the test, I did not expect my luck to be this good, and suddenly smash it!\"Chen Xiang scratching his head grinned.Everyone was looking at him with contempt, smas.h.i.+ng the stone with luck, only an idiot would believe that bulls.h.i.+t.\"Pa.s.sed!\"The person in-charge thought if this is not considered a pa.s.s, then no one will be able to pa.s.s.An additional stamp was added to his sheet, allowing him to partic.i.p.ate in the King City martial art tournament.Chen Xiang let out a deep breath, apparently the Yao family was not going to ask compensation for the Strength measuring stone.Certainly, this was not Chen Xiang's entire strength, as he was only using fire and wood attribute Qi, and the other three attribute True Qi still haven't been used it, if all five attribute True Qi has been fused, it would have been even more powerful.He had been practising for many days just to perfect the fusion between fire and wood attribute Qi, complementing one another, and turning into a more powerful True Qi, it was also the one of the main reasons for Chen Xiang to be a difficult opponent among the same level!Chen Xiang immediately started refining pills just after returning from the registration, even at this age, the pills refined by him were better than many of old alchemists, this is what Chen Luzhong said.In the past few days he had learnt a lot of alchemy skills and experiences from Su Meiyao, and shared them with Chen Luzhong, Chen Luzhong had also benefited a lot from them, but Chen Luzhong thought that they were Chen Xiang's own perception, so he admired his nephew more and more.Ten days pa.s.sed quickly, in the small courtyard of his, six fist sized golden fruit were s.h.i.+nning.As the sunlight shone on them, a very attractive golden glow was glittering.Near them one could feel the intense spirit Qi emitted by the Metal spirit fruit.\"This is a profound level high-grade spirit fruit ah!I wonder what it's taste like!\"Chen Xiang forcefully swallowed his own saliva, if those old alchemist came to know about his idea, he would be immediately beaten to pulp, eating a Metal spirit fruit was simply throwing it away.Chen Xiang cautiously picked up six s.h.i.+nning golden Metal spirit fruit, and after placing them inside his storage pouch, left the store in a hurry and arrived at a place nearby Danxiang herbal manor which was completely focused on seeking alchemist to help in alchemy, he had already prepared a notice to affix.\"Chen family Dan king hall, recruiting three alchemists capable of refining mortal level high-grade pills, remuneration-Metal spirit fruit..........\"Above he also wrote his name and address, although he had six Metal spirit fruit, he was going to leave some for his own use, after all this Metal spirit fruit is also very useful in refining Building foundation dan.Chen Xiang returned to store and patiently waited, he knew many alchemists will soon be attracted by the reward and come here, after-all a Metal spirit fruit is a priceless profound level high-grade spirit fruit, every alchemist desired them, soon he will be able to attract many alchemists.Chen Xiang did not have to wait for long, someone immediately came and asked for him, to his surprise it was not an alchemist but someone he is already acquainted with, Danxiang Herbal manor lord----Hua Yueyun!Chen Luzhong was also quite confused, he did not know anything about Chen Xiang using Metal spirit fruit for hiring alchemists, otherwise he would already been jumping around.Hua Yueyun got down from the horse carriage, and directly rushed into the store, at this moment she did not conceal her face with a veil, seemingly elegant and n.o.ble in her snow-white dress, .Chen Xiang immediately asked after noticing the resentment on her beautiful and elegant face:\"Manor lord Hua, what happened?\"\"Humph!\"With a low snort, Hua Yueyun asked with a serious face:\"Did you really use Metal spirit fruit as remuneration for recruiting alchemists?\"Chen Luzhong surprised for a moment, then quickly took a glance at Chen Xiang.\"What's the problem?Is it not allowed?\"Watching Chen Xiang nodding his head and spreading his hands as he spoke, Chen Luzhong was stunned and uttered a shriek, immediately after he shouted:\"YOU BRAT, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE METAL SPIRIT FRUIT, AND YOU\u2019RE USING IT FOR REMUNERATING ALCHEMISTS, ARE YOU CRAZY?\"One can only come across Metal spirit fruit serendipitously, they are very rare, ordinarily people who have Metal spirit fruit will only use it for themselves, while just selling its peel and the seed.Cough Cough!Chen Xiang placed two s.h.i.+nning golden fruit on the table, suddenly bizarre spirit Qi drifts out form them, which even made Chen Luzhong and Hua Yueyun scared!They didn't expect for Chen Xiang to have two of them.\"You.....you......you\"Chen Luzhong was left speechless.Hua Yueyun took a deep breath, after all she was from a big sect, and already had seen the world, but it was still inconceivable for her to see Chen Xiang at such a young age, to actually have such a treasure.Thousand vein fruit, h.e.l.l spirit gra.s.s, Thousand year beast dan, and now Metal spirit fruit, all of them were very precious and acquired by him.At this moment, Chen Xiang came up with one more Metal spirit fruit, both of them shuddered once again, Chen Xiang just chuckled and said:\"GrandUncle, I know you like to remain hidden, thus I give these three Metal spirit fruit to you for safekeeping, one is for your own use, while the other two for remuneration for recruiting alchemists, at the time when these alchemists come, they will all be reviewed by you.\"Hua Yueyun looking at the three s.h.i.+nning golden fruits on the table, nibbled her tender lips, an indescribable complexion visible on her face.In her opinion, Chen Xiang was a rare seedling of alchemy, and truly had a great chance in advancing to the true martial realm, but she just wasn't able to entice Chen Xiang in joining Danxiang Taoyuan.Chen Luzhong\u2019s hands were trembling as he carefully received the Metal spirit fruits, after forcefully restraining his excited heart, said:\"You brat, where did you get them?\"Chen Xiang randomly said:\"Last night, while practising in mountains I came across a hidden place, the whole tree I moved it back.\"\"Metal spirit tree normally will bear five fruits, it seems you are now quite rich!\"Hua Yueyun's pair of enchanting myriads eyes gently winked at Chen Xiang, indescribably charming.Chen Xiang tilted his head, avoiding her charming gaze, asked:\"Manor lord Hua, what did you come here for?\"\"Humph!\"\"I wanted to see whether you truly had Metal spirit fruit?But this approach of yours is too high-profile, it will be very troublesome, previously the Yao family didn't pay an ounce of attention to your Chen family Dan king hall, but as of now they will not allow you to open your shop smoothly as you are now using Metal spirit fruit to draw in alchemists.\"\"Who dares to stop us, I'll kill them!\"Chen Luzhong roared out in a majestic voice, he just received a Metal spirit fruit, given some time, he will be able to refine it into a pill, and thus breaking through his current bottleneck will be easy as pie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38:Dan KingEdited by:CloudGoat\"Young master Chen, you must reconsider my previous invitation that is but one good opportunity, and you must carefully reconsider!\"A sliver of pleading intention was present in Hua Yueyun's clear and pretty eyes.Hua Yueyun departed, Chen Luzhong gave a bizarre look to Chen Xiang, then asked in a low voice:\"Brat, that woman is also the Danxiang manor hall's manager, but in front of you she didn't have an ounce of arrogance, where did she invite you?\"[TLN:I will be using manager instead of hall lord.]\"She invited me to enter Danxiang Taoyuan, but as I am more interested in entering the Extreme martial sect, so I declined.\"\"What!?\"Chen Luzhong stared blankly for a moment, immediately after knocked on Chen Xiang's head:\"Danxiang Taoyuan is holy land for all alchemists and you brat actually declined.\"Chen Xiang caressed his head, curling his mouth, said:\"GrandUncle, this woman is just a maidservant, she had fooled many other people in joining Danxiang Taoyuan, and I will not do such stupid things!Enrolling into a sect is a very important matter, and I want to enrol in a sect which I admire.\"Once one becomes a sect's disciple, it would be very hard to leave, unless banished by the sect itself, and once banished no other sect will take them in, so Chen Xiang wanted to carefully consider the sect he choose.Chen Xiang had Su Meiyao to teach him alchemy, there was also the Dragon saliva exercise for maturing spirit herbs, he simply did not have any desire to enter Danxiang Taoyuan, thus he wanted to enter Extreme martial sect which has a very strong heritage.Not long before two alchemists showed up at the door, Chen Luzhong was mainly responsible for screening, primarily alchemists first wanted to take a glance at the Metal spirit fruit, so Chen Luzhong proudly took out the Metal spirit fruit before them, watching these alchemists looking at it with envy, made Chen Luzhong very happy in his heart.Chen Luzhong first let them refine pills on their own, afterwards he made them refine mortal level middle-grade pill, by observing the pill quality and time of the alchemy process, he identifies the level of these alchemists.What made Chen Luzhong depressed was that, in just one day, although there were tens of people applying, but only two or three could be regarded as alchemists.Moreover many even failed to meet the standards, there were even some guys who intended to fish in troubled waters.[TLN:Chinese Idiom(\u6d51\u6c34\u6478\u9c7c)=Fish in troubled waters, Meaning:Trying to make profit in a dangerous situation.]Chen Xiang was not anxious, as many alchemists often secluded themselves for alchemy, and thus yet have to receive the information.So he speculated in the next few days, there will be many alchemists affiliated to several forces of King City applying.Chen Xiang only planned on recruiting four good alchemists, two Metal spirit fruit is more than enough to make four alchemists stay here for some time, and by that time Dan King Hall will be strong and prosperous, and will not be afraid of being unable to recruit any alchemists.Like previously, Chen Xiang returned to his original routine, going to the outskirts to practice at night and returning early for refining pills at Dan King Hall.Three days went by since posting the notice, Chen Xiang returned from the mountains outside the city, saw early in the morning, some grey-white haired old-men standing around Dan King Hall entrance.At this time the sky had just lit up, Dan King Hall has yet to open, so these candidates for the alchemist position can only patiently wait, on ordinary days these alchemists were always aloof, they will not bat an eye even if many spirit coins were placed in front of them, but they regard these rare and precious spirit herbs as a treasure, as no amount of spirit coins can buy them.Chen Xiang was the one who came up with the name of the store\u2018Dan King Hall\u2019, as long they had a sufficient amount of pills they will be able to open!Because Chen Luzhong had enough qualification to be called an old alchemists, the other alchemists were more than happy to join to Dan King Hall.As the doors opened, tens of alchemists one after another hastily greeted Chen Luzhong, from the small amount of heat in the breath of these alchemists Chen Xiang roughly estimated their levels in alchemy, except for two, others True Qi were not pure enough and were only able to refine low-grade dan.Many of these half-baked alchemists were only here to try their luck, as they all knew the qualification required would certainly be high, after they entered Dan King Hall, Chen Xiang also tagged along with them.At this point, one blonde wrinkled old-man walked in, he shouted as soon as he entered:\"Steward Get the f.u.c.k out!\"When the old-man yelled, pure fire Qi burst out from his body, shocking the tens of alchemists, because each one of them desired for this level of fire Qi, they were very confident that this blonde old-man was definitely an alchemist, also a very famous one at that, but alchemists rarely make an appearance, thus they were widely known only by their name.Chen Xiang stood out and responded:\"I am the steward here, what do you want with me?\"Everyone knew Dan King Hall was the Chen family property, and the person in-charge was Chen Xiang.The blonde old-man spotted Chen Xiang, on his face suddenly revealed a look of contempt, his whole face full of arrogance, said:\"I want you to immediately change the name of your store, you are not allowed to use the name Dan King Hall, because you do not deserve it.\"Chen slightly squinted his eyes:\"Why?I chose this name, and in any way is not hampering you, if you are here to cause trouble, then do not blame me for being impolite!\"That blonde old-man contemptuously looked at Chen Xiang and sneered:\"This old-man is Dan King, so I will not allow you to use this brother\u2019s name for your store.\"[TLN:Well basically he used Ge(brother), sometimes refer themselves as Ge to show their superiority.]Dan king?After they heard these two words, Chen Luzhong and those alchemist candidates were immediately shocked.In the whole Southern Martial Empire high and low there were tens of millions of people, only had one alchemist with a very brilliant alchemy technique, called Dan king, moreover he had dealings with the Yao family.At this point everyone were able to determine, this proud old-man is the Southern Martial Empire's Dan king-----Meng Bo!Chen Xiang was no stranger to this name, since childhood he had often heard this name, and now unexpectedly able to see this person, he quickly determined that the Dan King is certainly sent by the Yao family to make trouble.Chen Xiang frowned, this was indeed somewhat troublesome, he named Dan King Hall because he wanted the store name to be somewhat domineering, he really did not expect the actual Dan King would walk in to smash the signboard.\"Humph, relying on this guy, dare to claim Dan king?I have been doing alchemy for thousands of years, and just barely able to achieve Dan Founder rank, let alone Dan King which is even superior to Dan Founder!\"Su Meiyao's contemptuous voice sounded in Chen Xiang mind.Chen Xiang was slightly surprised in his heart, at this time he came to know that originally that name was designated for an alchemist's level, his eyes lit up, ridiculing Meng Bo, said:\"Humph, you dare claim to be a Dan King?Do you have the ability to go to those big Sects and show off?You think others will not scold you;this not knowing of immensity of heaven and earth old-man!\"Speaking of big sects, other alchemists were also longing to know about how formidable the alchemists inside those big sects.In front of those alchemists, Meng Bo obviously did not dare to claim to be a Dan King, he can only show off as such in this mortal world country.Meng Bo\u2019s face turned red with anger, he had not thought;Chen Xiang the little devil would dare to humiliate him moreover in front of others.But what he said he also could not refute, he knew he cannot compare to those alchemists in big sects, and if he went there he can only be one little messenger.Chen Xiang saw Meng Bo\u2019s old face turn red with anger, said:\"Since you think your own alchemy technique is brilliant, then how about a little compet.i.tion with this brat, and these alchemist can be the judge.\"\"Since..........this is a compet.i.tion, of course we should add a prize, if I lose, I'll give you the Metal spirit fruit, and if you lose?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39:RespectEdited by:CloudGoatChen Xiang and the Southern Martial Empire's Dan King were going to compete in alchemy, tens of alchemists were surprised so much that their jaws were touching the ground, Chen Luzhong knew Chen Xiang's talent was very high regarding alchemy, but to challenge a Dan King, he was still too tender.However the reward offered by Chen Xiang was too enticing, in the mortal world the spirit Qi was relatively thin, resulting in spirit herbs to be very rare, so alchemists in the mortal world cannot resist the temptation of such a rare and precious spirit herb.Meng Bo looked upward and burst into laughter:\"Ha-ha-ha......such being the case, this old-man will accompany you, if I lose, I'll give you my Profound yang alchemic furnace!\"Profound yang alchemic furnace!That is but one famous furnace, it is said to be made up of precious Profound yang stone, it was said there was a mystical force inside the furnace, which is also the reason for Meng Bo to have such great achievements in alchemy.These alchemists\u2019gazes were full of envy as Meng Bo took out a fiery red alchemic furnace, this alchemic furnace was small and exquisite, seemingly like a carved out red gem, there were many fine patterns on the outside, and one could tell it was by no means refined out by someone from mortal world.\"If we are competing in dan rank, then I will absolutely lose, to be fair, the most I can refine is a high-grade pill, Aura Qi Dan!\"This was the only way he had any chance of winning, at present he was only able to refine high-grade pills.Aura Qi Dan provided a great help to 6th level of mortal martial realm pract.i.tioner, as 7th level of mortal martial realm was'True aura realm', and at this state one is able to transform'True Qi'into'Aura'.After taking Aura Qi Dan, it helps 6th level of mortal martial realm martial artists in familiarizing with Aura Qi, 7th realm of mortal martial realm martial artists took in energy to strengthen their True Qi, making it much quicker and easier to transform True Qi into aura, and also strengthen it quickly.\"No problem, begin now?\"Meng Bo readily agreed down, in his eyes, regardless of how high Chen Xiang's alchemic talent was, after all he is only a little devil.It was absolutely impossible for him to win, if his refined pill quality was not good as Chen Xiang, then he will also sincerely convinced about his defeat.\"Start now, each one is responsible for their own herbs, if you do not have it, then I will wait for you to get some so that you will not fall behind.\"Chen Xiang said, for more than one month, he had been constantly learning to refine other pills, he had also refined the Aura Qi Dan several times, apart from that after some failures in the beginning, he understood the essentials like the back of his hand, and has yet to fail again.\"Of course I have the herbs, so let\u2019s begin!There are so many alchemists to judge, I think the final result certainly would be very notary!\"Meng Bo said, at present he is unexpectedly excited, he had been very jealous of Chen Xiang for owning the Metal spirit fruit, because he owed the Yao family a favour, so he agreed to come here and break the event.To Meng Bo\u2019s surprise, Chen Xiang was one young aggressive brat, he even proposed a compet.i.tion with such a large disparity in their strength, and he certainly is not going to miss this opportunity.Chen Luzhong and the other alchemists were also very thrilled, because they can personally see how the famous Dan King refine pill, which is but one rare opportunity!Most pill refining methods were similar, but the process of dealing herbs were nothing but different, moreover some herbs nature were very special, when dealing with these kinds of herbs, one has to be very cautious, otherwise it would be a failure, and worst case scenario the furnace would explode.Moreover herbs would be lost, for low-grade pills it was okay, but failure during high-grade pills, many alchemists were distressed about it for long-time.At this point Chen Xiang and Meng Bo simultaneously poured flames into their respective alchemic furnace, producing fire Qi inside the furnace, while simultaneously controlling the inside temperature, only then placed the herbs inside.Herbs required for the Aura Qi Dan, although somewhat expensive, but it was still profitable to sell in the market.The primary herbs were'Yuan spirit mud', 'Earth aura gra.s.s-root', 'Profound spirit ginseng', 'h.e.l.lfire gra.s.s', then there were some auxiliary herbs, mainly more than fifty year old Ginseng, Spirit gra.s.s, Shouwu, Earth spirit gra.s.s and other common spirit herbs.This Aura Qi Dan difficulty lied in processing the Yuan spirit mud and Earth aura gra.s.s-root, Yuan spirit mud was a sludge containing spirit Qi, and only found in special places, this mud was also capable of self-absorbing the spirit Qi, and afterwards refining the spirit Qi, this spirit Qi was relatively similar to near immortal type aura.It was also quite difficult to bake the Yuan spirit mud into herbal powder and herbal Qi, as the magnitude of required flames was extremely high.Earth aura gra.s.s-root is a type of spirit herb grown inside Yuan spirit mud, and the gra.s.s-roots were present deep inside the Yuan spirit mud, after breeding, it produces'Earth aura', as this gra.s.s-root was very easily burned to nothing, and that peculiar aura Qi was also very easy to evaporate, thus it was necessary to use divine sense to control the flames and protect them simultaneously.Chen Xiang in the beginning failed many times because of these two difficulties, but afterwards as he grasped the subtle essentials, he was able to easily refine'Aura Qi Dan', at this point Chen Xiang's face was quite relaxed while baking the herbs into herbal powder and herbal spirit Qi, only by thorough refining, can it actually drive out all the impurities, otherwise it would affect the pill quality, for this requirement Chen Xiang was very strict on himself, so the pills he refines all turned out to be of superior quality.Every-time there were subtle changes in the temperature all around, Chen Luzhong and those alchemist were able to sense it, from time to time black Qi also emerged from the alchemic furnace as the herbs impurities were released, making everyone all feel speechless with admiration, and even Meng Bo was sweating, and his eyebrows were knitted together.In contrast Chen Xiang had a somewhat relaxed look.Obviously, Meng Bo had not refined the Aura Qi Dan for quite some time, as long as one was out of practice for some time, they would forget the feeling of subtle type of fire control, and will be difficult to grasp the degree of heat required for each spirit herb.Suddenly, that ruby like alchemic furnace of Meng Bo\u2019s slightly shook, five or six different colour spirit Qi were rising from it!Meng Bo even made a mistake, one Dan King actually failed during the refining of mortal level middle-grade pill, all alchemists present felt very disappointed, and some even secretly despised this Dan King.\"GrandUncle, give him a set of Aura Qi Dan herbs, he will refine anew, he still has time to catch-up!\"Chen Xiang opened his eyes and lightly said.Meng Bo was suddenly stunned, suddenly a hint of shame flashed through his eyes, only to see Chen Xiang smilingly said:\"During alchemy because herbs were insufficient, resulting in failure to a.n.a.lyze the deviations!This compet.i.tion has to be fair as you lacked preparation.\"Meng Bo slightly nodded his head, he knew Chen Xiang was slightly stepping down for him, after all he is a famous alchemist, this error may very well result in tarnis.h.i.+ng his reputation and he may even not be able to show his face in public, so he was secretly grateful in his heart.At this point he understood Chen Xiang was not supercilious like the rumours had depicted, whether it was people skills, or subtlety, he was far better than Yao Tianhua whom he guided several times.Chen Luzhong soon brought the herbs, Meng Bo started refining again, but this time he had calmed down, and no longer underestimate Chen Xiang, he actually treated Chen Xiang as an opponent of similar skills!A little time pa.s.sed, though it had been very quiet, Chen Luzhong and the alchemists present knew that within these two alchemic furnace, very complicated process were undergoing.Half an hour pa.s.sed, finally it was time to condensate the pill, Chen Xiang was leading, only to see Chen Xiang come up with some sort of green liquid, and dripped it into one of alchemic furnace openings, this liquid was the Dragon saliva diluted with water, if added during the time of condensing pills, it helps in improving the quality of the pill, Su Meiyao was the one who told him.Chen Xiang opened his eyes, and slightly implored some Qi, and at this time Meng Bo wiped his forehead, he was also done.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40:Fire Dragon Blood JadeEdited By:CloudGoatMeng Bo originally came to find fault, but now he was ashamed in his heart, he was grateful about Chen Xiang\u2019s previous conduct, thus he decided even if he won, he would not accept the Metal spirit fruit.In an ordinary situation, three Aura Qi Dan can be refined at once, and for formidable alchemists they can refine four pills at once, after Meng Bo opened the lid of Profound Yang alchemic furnace, one could see four transparent pills with a trace of light yellow colour gradually levitating.\"Four Aura Qi Dan, worthy of Dan King!\"Nearby one Alchemist could not help but praise:\"From the looks of the colour and herbal fragrance, the pill quality should be excellent!\"At this time, it was Chen Xiang's turn, and after Chen Xiang opened his alchemic furnace, he gently blew, as the mist blew away, this time everyone were shocked, astonishment clearly visible on their face.Five exquisitely carved, flawless pills were visible inside the furnace, but also there was a trace of white glossiness, there was no visible impurities in the Aura Qi Dan, as the herbal aroma entered into their nose, no one could believe it.Not only five pills, but also of excellent quality, this level is far more than that of Meng Bo!Meng Bo heaved a sigh, when he saw Chen Xiang, his eyes were full of respect.Before, he thought Chen Xiang was the same as Yao Tianhua, although somewhat talented, but still proud and arrogant, but now he saw that Chen Xiang refined Aura Qi Dan quality was far more superior to his, and could not help but be sincerely convinced!\"I lost!\"Meng Bo sighed and said, he was no longer a Dan King full of arrogance, and now he looked much older, after-all this was for him a big blow.\"Meng Lao, I think you usually don't refine Aura Qi Dan!You can still refine the pill with such quality in an unfamiliar situation, as a junior I'm impressed, so be it, we consider it a tie, I did not win, and you did not lose.\"Chen Xiang showed a gentle smile, Meng Bo in the entire Southern Martial Empire was the most powerful alchemist, it was better to be friends with him.[TLN:Lao means old, it is used when speak to someone who are close to them and much older than them.]Meng Bo shook his head, and then took out the red s.h.i.+nning Profound yang alchemic furnace and handed it to Chen Xiang:\"A lost is lost, this alchemic furnace is yours, for many years I have been relying on this alchemic furnace, and had neglected some basic things, it should have a better master than me.\"Meng Bo's and Chen Xiang's actions, made those alchemist present filled with admiration, this made them have a new understanding of them.Chen Xiang spread his hand:\"Meng Lao, you should join our Dan King Gall, become the chief alchemist of the store?The Profound yang furnace is yours, while you still can obtain the Metal spirit fruit!\"Everyone was surprised, Chen Xiang actually wanted to reel in Meng Bo to Dan King Hall!Chen Luzhong eyes lit up, smiled apologetically and quickly said:\"This Dan King Hall needs Meng Lao to take charge, then only it can be undoubtedly Dan King Hall!\"Meng Bo pondered for a moment, said:\"Good, but this alchemic furnace you must accept, you have very solid basics, with the help of this furnace, you will get twice the result with half the effort!\"Surprisingly Meng Bo complied, but the alchemist present were very unhappy with the presence of one such powerful Dan King.Now they would not be able to fish in troubled waters after entering Dan King Hall.At this time, one old-man said:\"Manger Chen, this old-man does not seek to be alchemist here, only hopes to be a janitor, you also do not need to pay.\"Seeing the old-man, other followed the suit, having expressed their willingness to stay here without a pay, because they can together learn a lot of things from Dan King.\"Well......Meng Lao you take responsibility!\"Chen Xiang scratched his head and laughed.Meng Bo frowned while looking at the dozens of old-men, then nodded his head:\"You can stay behind.\"Next, Chen Luzhong and Meng Bo picked two good alchemists from the tens of old-men, and gave them the Metal spirit fruit as remuneration.After Meng Bo joined, Chen Xiang felt relieved, at least now he does not need to refine pills by himself, which was very tedious for him.\"GrandUncle, you should be the manager, you have been managing Spirit Dan Hall for many years, and is quite experienced regarding this, while Meng Lao and other seniors are simply responsible for alchemy.\"Although Meng Bo is a Dan King, but perennial goes in seclusion for alchemy, so regarding management had no experience.Meng Bo and the others also had no clue, Chen Luzhong also nodded, now inside Dan King Hall there were four relatively good alchemists and a dozen or so ordinary level alchemists, in comparison to the Yao family and Danxiang herbal manor, they had many alchemists compared to other forces.At night, Chen Xiang and a group of white s.h.i.+nning haired old-men were sitting together, discussing alchemy techniques, Chen Xiang was taught by Su Meiyao, that alchemy technique was very brilliant, combined with his own experience, gave some pointers.Making the congregation of alchemists benefit greatly, everyone admired Chen Xiang, at such a young age, he had comprehended such things which made them exclaim in surprise.\"Chen Xiang, about this morning affront please forgive me!The Yao family once gave me some herbs, therefore I owe them a favour, but from now on between me and them it's written off.\"Meng Bo face looked ashamed.Chen Xiang smiles, said:\"The past is the past, the Yao family\u2019s hate for me is deeply rooted, after-all I made them lose face.\"He got one good alchemic furnace and one excellent alchemist now, and this is all thanks to the Yao family, he was secretly grateful to the Yao family in his heart.\"Then we have to work hard, because the King City martial art tournament is about to begin, I have to prepare myself, I have to be first and get that True elemental dan.\"Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes glittered with a confident aura, this time everyone once again got startled, because they admire Chen Xiang for his alchemy talent, they completely forgot about his strength, now that they thought about it, Chen Xiang was also one of the strongest martial artists among younger generation!Chen Xiang with his strength remained unscathed against that 7th level of mortal martial realm Yao family elder, and even defeated him, this type of talent was simply monstrous!\"I will go out and practice, everybody rest early!\"Chen Xiang dropped this sentence and walked away.Inside the forest at the outskirts of King City, Chen Xiang looking at the Profound yang alchemic furnace glittering with a fiery red aura, was somewhat excited in his heart.When he touched the furnace, he knew the furnace was extraordinary.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou the two peerless beauty also came out of the ring, looking at the Profound yang furnace won by Chen Xiang.\"Fire dragon blood jade!\"Bai Youyou could not help but retreat a few steps, on ordinary days this elegant beauty was always cold but now actually feared this Profound yang furnace.Su Meiyao's eyes were s.h.i.+nning while looking at the alchemic furnace, then bent down, and with her delicate hands caressed it gently, as similar to as caressing a baby.Bai Youyou slowly came over, stubbornly staring at Profound yang furnace on the ground, her tender body wrapped in purple dress was actually slightly trembling, it looked as if she was facing an enemy.\"Yes, indeed it is the Fire dragon blood jade, I did not think that you, brat will get such an extreme treasure!If that half-baked Dan King came to know, he will probably die with grief.\"Su Meiyao smiled, and her face was full of joy, it was truly enchanting and moving, making people as such they could not wait to take her in her arms with love and affection.Chen Xiang hastily put away the furnace, although he did not know what the Fire dragon blood jade, but he can see that Bai Youyou was very afraid of this alchemic furnace, with some guilt, he said:\"Youyou sister, I'm sorry, I didn't knew you were afraid of this thing.\"Bai Youyou complexion eased a lot, whispered:\"It's ok, it's not your fault!\"Her voice was actually so gentle and enchanting, Chen Xiang could not help but be surprised for a moment, an unspeakable tenderness suddenly surged in his heart, and he felt an inexplicable comfort.Bai Youyou saw Chen Xiang's complexion somewhat strange, coldly said:\"I practice devil exercises and my extreme yin body conflicts with this extreme yang Fire dragon blood jade.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41:Flame dragon brilliant furnaceEdited By:CloudGoatFire dragon blood?Chen Xiang was startled.The Profound yang alchemic furnace was not built from Profound yang stone, but Fire dragon blood jade?As the name suggested, the Fire dragon blood jade was a jade holding a Fire dragon's blood.Dragons, according to legends are ancient divine beasts capable of dominating heaven and earth, never been seen by anyone.\"Fire dragon blood jade, made after soaking jade into Fire dragon's blood, not only is it indestructible, but also emits a strange fire Qi, which has a great advantage on pills.This alchemic furnace is a sacred level dragon weapon!\"After speaking, Su Meiyao's beautiful cheeks became a little rosy, appearing to be extremely excited.Even this ice-cold beauty Bai Youyou, ordinarily her face was similar to snow but now excitement could be seen on her face.Chen Xiang knew this alchemic furnace was formidable, but he was still confused, he muttered:\"How formidable?\"Su Meiyao tenderly spat, then charmingly said:\"Silly boy, you just made a big profit, in this mortal world, various magic weapon can be divided into----ordinary weapon, spirit weapon, precious weapon, then above, after transferring to heavens above, refined by immortals----immortal weapon and sacred weapon, while sacred level dragon weapon is made by adding dragon body parts during the time of refining, among sacred weapons it is the most formidable.\"Chen Xiang's mouth slightly twitched, for him it was somewhat unbelievable:\"This......this alchemic furnace is from the heavens.\"\"That is natural, if a dragon appeared in this mortal world, then, the whole mortal world will collapse and destruct as it cannot afford the power released by the dragon.\"Bai Youyou said.\"Really a dragon?\"Chen Xiang swallowed his saliva.Su Meiyao's jade like fingers teased the black hairs on his forehead, slowly said:\"Of course, if you have the opportunity to leave this mortal martial world, and go to those high rank worlds, you will know your own insignificance.\"\"I will go in, I really cannot stand this Fire dragon blood jade, junior sister you instruct him how to receive that sacred level dragon weapon.\"Finished speaking, Bai Youyou disappeared, she entered inside the ring.This time Su Meiyao was in a good mood, her face wearing a shallow smile, looking very attractive and charming:\"Take out that alchemic furnace, and bleed on it.\"After Chen Xiang took out the Profound yang furnace, with a small blade cut his finger, as the blood dripped on the furnace and touched the smooth and bright red alchemic furnace, a red light suddenly flashed, at this time myriads of information surging into his mind, Chen Xiang got excited and immediately stood up.\"This alchemic furnace is called Flame dragon brilliant furnace, refined by someone called Yan Longzi.\"Chen Xiang excitedly said:\"This furnace allows the alchemist to have better control over the temperature inside, moreover it can strengthen the flames.The flames inside, under the effect of Flame dragon blood jade, are transformed into a kind flame which is helpful in alchemy!Making it much more convenient to refine pills.\"After speaking, Chen Xiang was much more excited, he said:\"The most powerful point, not only does this alchemic furnace reduce the time of alchemy, but there is also an array law---Yin and yang against chaos, which can allow to speed up the pa.s.sage of time inside.\"After hearing, Su Meiyao\u2019s graceful curvy tender body could not help but slightly tremble, she looked up at the round moon, muttered:\"I and senior sister will not have to wait long for our strength to restore!In the end, who is this Yan Longzi?The person refining this thing should be rather famous, but I've not heard of him...\"Su Meiyao pursed her lips, apparently thinking of something.Chen Xiang laughingly said:\"Meiyao sister, of course you have not heard of him, this is man is but from heaven........Ordinarily it would take me an hour and half to refine Baptizing marrow dan, but now I think, I would be done in half an hour, even half an hour is too much!\"Chen Xiang holding the Flame dragon brilliant furnace, his face full of'looking forward to'expression.Su Meiyao's charming eyes like silk looked at Chen Xiang, face with a shallow smile, it's enchanting and moving.Chen Xiang slightly absent-minded, coughed twice, said:\"I would be able to help the two sisters in restoring their strengths early, this little brother is also very happy, I will also try hard.\"Su Meiyao came near, with her soft tender hands stroked Chen Xiang's handsome cheeks, while wafting orchid like aroma, casting a coquettish glance, prettily said:\"You're a darling, sister now likes you a bit.\"Listening to that numbing soft voice, feeling the stroking of that tender jade like hands, Chen Xiang swallowed his saliva, gave a hollow laugh and said:\"Meiyao sister, I want to start practicing, currently I cannot utilise this alchemic furnaces power, I have to become stronger.\"Su Meiyao smiled and nodded her head, then kissed Chen Xiang's cheek, immediately afterwards entered into the ring, only to leave Chen Xiang in a daze.After a while, Chen Xiang's hand touched his cheek, his heartbeat accelerated, he did not expect this peerless beauty Su Meiyao would kiss him, he had never fantasized about them, as he knew both Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou are not only absolutely beautiful, but also very powerful, so he has never fantasized, but now it seems a little may come true.\"Truly is a Yaojing, making my mind restless.\"Chen Xiang swore in his heart, but this time he was very happy, he can be intimate with such a woman, really is worthy to be happy about.Originally Chen Xiang planned to exercise at night, but now he was refining pills, having such a sacred level dragon weapon alchemic furnace, he certainly wanted to try it immediately!Chen Xiang carried a lot of herbs, this time he was refining Baptizing marrow dans, when he placed the herbs inside the alchemic furnace, the inside of the alchemic furnace clearly appeared in his mind, even some tiny traces upon herbs were crystal clear.At this time, Chen Xiang just infused flames into the alchemic furnace, then arbitrary controlled the flames temperature.Even the divine sense consumption was very little, he could even leave a trace of his divine sense to look over the alchemic furnace, and practice at the same time!At this time Chen Xiang knew that he obtained a great alchemic furnace, during alchemy he can get twice result with only half of the effort.Of course, he has solid basics, therefore using this sacred level dragon weapon alchemic furnace to refine pills, was simply effortless.Half an hour pa.s.sed, while Chen Xiang had already refined Baptizing marrow dan twice, and four pills each time!He was usually able to refine three pills, but with the help of Flame dragon alchemic furnace he can utilise all the herbs, and under the bizarre time acceleration, save more time, several times faster than usual.Just to stimulate the profound law inside alchemic furnace, it had absorbed a large amount of his True Qi.\"Brother, now you should start refining Aura Qi Dan, it will allow you to enter 7th level of mortal martial realm----True aura realm, you should know ordinary people are not like you that is to be able to take such a large amount of Aura Qi Dan.\"Su Meiyao transmits in a cutesy voice.In many alchemists eyes Aura Qi Dan is quite difficult to refine, moreover it is a mortal level middle-grade pill, therefore many alchemists does not want to refine, but Chen Xiang is nothing but fearless, because he now has the Flame dragon brilliant furnace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Advance into Level 7Chen Xiang continued to practice at night. He took out four Baptizing Marrow Dans and swallowed them in one breath while simultaneously operating the [Tai chi Divine Exercise] to digest their potency. At the break of dawn, he left for the Danxiang Herbal Manor to buy another twenty sets of Aura Qi Dan's herbs.Chen Xiang had basically used up all his spirit coins after buying the spirit herbs. He had already previously invested most of his spirit coins into the store, so he was short on spirit coins. But as soon as Dan King Hall started doing business, he would earn all his spending\u2019s along with a hefty profit.During the day, Chen Xiang stayed in his room and refined Aura Qi Dan, for him, refining has just been too easy now. Moreover, each time six dans were being refined out, in just half an hour, he had refined two sets of herbs. In five hours, he had already finished refining all twenty sets of herbs he had previously bought, a grand total of one hundred twenty dans! Even just selling them at the minimum market price of five thousand large spirit coins would earn him six hundred thousand large spirit coins! On the other hand, he spent only hundred thousand large spirit coins to purchase those herbs, even a fool could see how profitable refining dans was.Meng Bo didn't know about the furnace, and it\u2019s ability to recognize a master after bleeding on it, so he wasn't able to utilise the true power of the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace. If he had known about this, Chen Xiang wouldn\u2019t even be able have a look at it. Thinking about this, he felt slightly guilty, therefore he quietly gave a Metal Spirit Fruit and a small chunk of h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s to Meng Bo, only after this did Chen Xiang feel less guilty.At night, Chen Xiang took some of the Aura Qi Dans he had previously refined and left for forest near the outskirts of the city. In the forest, he swallowed as many as ten dans in one deep breath, as if he was eating peanuts. If other people came to know about this, their jaws would be wide open until it was almost about to be dislocated from shock.Chen Xiang operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and started refining their potencies. Gradually a strange Spirit Qi gushed out from the dans at some point, he felt the trace of Aura Qi being released from the Aura Qi Dans...Every night Chen Xiang would unceasingly eat ten dans and cultivate his True Qi, while during the day practiced the Azure Dragon and Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise from the [Divine Exercise of the Four Symbols], as for [White Tiger Divine Exercise], a special environment with dense Slaughter Qi was required to practice it, while the [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise] required a area full of water. Moreover, both of them required his strength to be above 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm at least, so he kept them at the back of his mind.In blink of an eye, only three days were left before the King City Martial Art Tournament started.The moonlight was s.h.i.+ning and countless stars were twinkling in the sky at night, meanwhile, Chen Xiang was busy absorbing large amount of Spirit Qi inside the forest as always. He also ate a few Aura Qi Dans, he had already consumed a large amount of dans these few days, this also made up for the insufficient Spirit Qi present in the atmosphere.A layer of white fog started swirling around Chen Xiang's body, emitting a strange kind of energy, any leaves around him instantly transformed into tiny particles if they even grazed this white fog.This white fog was none other than 'Aura Qi', only now had Chen Xiang grasped the essentials to transform his true Qi into aura, but in turn he had to spend a large amount of True Qi. Only someone with vigorous true Qi would be able to continuously attack with 'True Aura'.Early in the morning inside the forest, a bare chested robust teenager blasted a boulder into pieces with just his fists. Wind whirred around his fists, waves of Qi was bursting out from him, any boulder they touched ceased to exist. 'Peng Peng Peng', a st.u.r.dy stone wrapped around in his True Aura broke into several pieces like a mud ball gradually falling apart.\"This is 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm strength, now with just one thought I can transform my True Qi into True Aura!\" Chen Xiang clinched his fists, as he vigorously stamped his foot, all the broken stones littered on the ground suddenly flew up, frightening Aura Qi emanated from his body and immediately grinded the stones in mid-air into powder.Chen Xiang thought, his current strength, when compared to 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, was much more formidable! But this level of power was still nothing in the eyes of those big sects, only those with strength above 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm could establish a foothold in those sects, which was also why he was never arrogant, he knew no matter how good you thought you were, there was always someone out there that was better.Meng Bo, the Dan King of Southern Martial Empire had joined Dan King Hall caused an uproar in the whole King City, immediately bolstering Dan King Hall\u2019s fame, despite the fact it still had yet to be opened. Many people were looking forward to the opening of the store, every day store entrance would be crowded and many people unceasingly came to ask about the store\u2019s grand opening. Of course, since Meng Bo joined Dan King Hall, the Yao Family felt a tremendous pressure, because they feared Chen family's Dan King Hall would catch up with their position in the Southern Martial Empire.Although Danxiang Herbal Manor sold dans, hey still fell behind compared their sale of herbs, as they were mainly in the business of selling spirit herbs. As such, the opening of Dan King Hall had a little effect on them, moreover both parties already had established a cooperative relation.After dressing up Chen Xiang started walking towards the King City, on his way he was thinking about the opening of Dan King Hall.While walking, he suddenly noticed that there was something amiss. He felt someone was hiding inside the forest.\"Come out, no need to hide now!\" Chen Xiang's voice was extremely cold, full of killing intent, since he and the Yao Family were bitter enemies, he had always been in a state of vigilance, he already knew sooner or later the Yao Family would send someone to a.s.sa.s.sinate him.His voice just died down, a 'Xiu' sound came. Like a lightning bolt, Chen Xiang stretched his hand and caught an arrow that had been shot at him. He then quickly moved his body, with both flexibility and agility shuttling through the forest, only a flicker of his figure was visible.Chen Xiang appeared near a tree and operated his Aura Qi, 'Boom', his fist struck the tree and blasted it into smithereens, and immediately after a scream came from behind the tree. Whoever was hiding behind the tree had just died from the explosion caused by Chen Xiang's overbearing punchChen Xiang frowned, he was able to sense all the changes happening around him. After entering into 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. his divine sense had become even more acute and at this moment, he clearly felt numerous arrows raining towards him.Suddenly from his palm, an azure Aura Qi surge out and formed a wall of aura in front of him, that rainstorm of arrows were entirely shunned by this aura wall.\"Three hundred arrows, three hundred individuals! It seems you cannot wait to kill me!\" Chen Xiang\u2019s whole face turned cold, a monstrous killing intent surge in his heart.\"Since you want to kill me, then do not blame me.\" As his sound transmitted, a wave of Slaughter Qi swept through the whole forest like a cold wind.The White Tiger was a G.o.d of slaughtering, after cultivating the [White Tiger Divine Exercise] the cultivator would possess a very intense Slaughter Qi, which was capable of deterring the opposite party, while simultaneously enhancing their own strength. Now Chen Xiang had casted out most basic of the [White Tiger Divine Exercise], [Slaughtering Heart].Unless he comprehended this exercise well, he would never be able to practice other martial skills of the [White Tiger Divine Exercise], this [Slaughtering Heart] was also the best and quickest way of slaughtering his opponents!Chen Xiang released his formidable divine sense, and quickly arrived near a big tree. He had already sensed many people hiding in the tree, although they hid well but they were still discovered by Chen Xiang.\"Humph, you think with quant.i.ty you will be able to kill me!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly spoke, his body vanished into the forest like a mirage. He was simply too quick, it was impossible for the archers hiding in the tree to get a hold of his location. Even if they occasionally hit him by pure dumb luck, it would always be blocked by the Aura Qi covering his body.An Azure Aura wrapped Chen Xiang's fist, while lightning was flas.h.i.+ng above them. He jumped to a nearby tree, and struck towards the trunk of the tree.Boom Boom Boom........Azure lighting ran through the entire tree, subsequently the trunk exploded into pieces. Flame and lightning aura burst out from within, the treetop was entirely charred like it was burnt by the flames, soon after six charred bodies gradually fell from above.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43:Devil exerciseTranslated and edited by:AshChen Xiang took out a long broadsword from his storage pouch and fiercely leapt into air, in blink of an eye he flew past dozens of treetops, while simultaneously waving the broadsword with madness, one after another aura Qi flashed out from the blade, transforming into azure Qi blade and flying towards the treetops, immediately after several shrieks came from the trees inside, followed by pieces of flesh accompanied with blood raining from the branches of the tree.In blink of an eye several people died, after killing these people Chen Xiang's slaughter Qi also rose, once again he leapt towards another treetop, while directly covering his long blade with aura Qi and he hacked towards this tree, when five people hiding inside the tree saw Chen Xiang\u2019s formidable strength, without any further ado they directly fled.These people are only at 2nd or 3rd level of mortal martial realm, and their speed and power cannot even compare to Chen Xiang, in a flash their head flew one after another from their neck.\"Everybody retreat, he is 7th level of mortal martial realm expert.\"One shocked shout came, after which many black robe people jumped down from the tree and fled in different direction.Those black robe people didn't even know who they were trying to kill, only the person leading them knew, and that is also the one who identified Chen Xiang's strength, while that person was trying to flee, Chen Xiang locked onto this man Qi.Although the forest was very dense, but it did not affect Chen Xiang's speed in any way, his Qing gong has already reached to acme perfection, with a little aid from the branches he leapt into the sky, skimming through several trees, and his blade pierced straight into that black robe man\u2019s body, but it did not kill him, from the method which Bai Youyou taught him, he held the head of the captivated leader to get some answers.\"Who are you and why did you want to kill me?\"Both eyes of the leader turned sluggish, he replied:\"We are the members of Black wind gang, my father ordered me to come here and kill you.\"\"Who is you father?\"\"Black wind gang's chief.......\"After listening Chen Xiang slightly frowned, his palm struck that man\u2019s spirit location, after killing him, with light and fast steps he ran, and tried to catch up those fleeing black robe men.Whole forest was lit into flames by Chen Xiang, as long as he caught someone location from his divine sense, he blasted a fist in that direction, releasing countless Zhu Que aura Qi, and they transformed into arrows of fire and flew towards the black robe men, every time killing few people.These people were only at 3rd level of mortal martial realm, in his eyes they were weak like an ant, simply untenable, not to mention they were still inside the fire sea.Smoke was billowing in the forest, every time a tree fell it was accompanied by loud screams, the forest was like a blazing h.e.l.l, and Chen Xiang was the lord of this h.e.l.l.Half an hour past, fire inside the forest was now extinguished, hostility was coming off from Chen Xiang's whole body, more than three hundred individuals and no one was spared, everybody died at his hands, which also helped him in comprehending White tiger divine exercise.After the refinement of him body from Immortal and devil pond, he had laid solid foundation for practicing immortal and devil body, his body was strengthen up to a terrible degree, the more stronger the body is, the more strong and vigorous the true Qi would be!\"Black wind gang!After the King city martial art tournament, I'll find you and whoever ordered you.\"Chen Xiang put away that bloodied long blade, and operated the Tai Chi divine exercise to restrain his slaughter Qi and returned to King city.Chen Xiang only returned to Dan king hall in the evening, he was surprised to see Chen Tianhu standing there.\"Dad, how did you come here?You look pale\u2026\u2026.what happened?\"Chen Xiang hurriedly walk towards him and held Chen Tianhu's wrist, as he released his divine sense into his body to probe his injuries, he saw Chen Tianhu dantian was broken, but also his injuries are now stabilized and are slowly recovering.Although Chen Xiang's face was expressionless, but the killing intent emanating from his body even affected Chen Tianhu, at this point Meng Bo and Chen Luzhong also came out, when they felt Chen Xiang\u2019s intense slaughter Qi, they could not help but be surprised, this type of Qi can only be congealed out after killing many people, and it was harder to imagine at such a young age Chen Xiang already have such an appalling slaughter Qi.\"Dad, who injured you?\"Chen Xiang asked in a hoa.r.s.e cold tone.Chen Tianhu has not seen his son for only few months, but he can still feel how much Chen Xiang have changed, and he sensed his strength is a lot stronger.Sigh!\"Chen Furong!\"Chen Furong, one of the old veterans of Chen family, he was also recruited by those martial arts sects, heard his name, Chen Xiang already knew the reason Chen Furong acted like this.\"Chen Furong to stop Dan king hall from opening, came to me and asked me to close Dan king hall, since I disagreed and defied his order, he wounded me, my strength and his..........\"Chen Tianhua sounded very angry.Chen Luzhong also could not help but angrily said:\"This Chen Furong is simply lawless, he is already not welcomed by any of the Chen family member, as other veterans are no longer present, he could do whatever he wants, he is truly an a---ole.\"Chen Furong returned from those martial arts sect, so his strength should be no less than 9th level of mortal martial realm, currently Chen Xiang can\u2019t possibly deal with him.Chen Xiang clenched his fist tightly, and he swore he will make Chen Furong pay for what he has done!Although Chen Xiang anger is not visible on his face, but Chen Tianhua, Chen Luzhong and Meng Bo are clearly able to feel his monstrous anger, which was accompanied by a heart trembling slaughter Qi.\"Your father has already been stabilized, you do not need to worry about that.\"Meng Bo said, at this time he knew Chen Xiang is out of the ordinary, he knew it is impossible for Chen Xiang to remain in this secular world, instead he will certainly make a mark in those big sects.Chen Xiang nodded his head:\"Many thanks Meng Lao, we first prepare to open Dan king hall in coming few days, the more he wants to stop us, the sooner I want it open.\"Chen Xiang after leaving these words, he left Dan king hall, Chen Tianhu and others did not try to ask where he was going.\"Brat, I know you are very angry but you have to calm down and listen to me, I have one quick way to enhance your strength and make you breakthrough to 8th level of mortal martial realm!\"Bai Youyou ice cold voice soon came after he left, as she tried clam his anger down.Chen Xiang's eyes lit up and hastily asked:\"Youyou sister, what do I\u2019ve to do?\"He has just advanced into 7th level of mortal martial realm, but if you want to enter 8th level in a short time, it is still very unrealistic, but this ice cold beauty still have some means for him to advance.\"If you have not been practising immortal and devil body, I would have not allow you to study my devil skills this quickly.\"Devil skill!Chen Xiang from Su Meiyao have learned that Bai Youyou\u2019s devil skills are both fearful and formidable, he already wanted to study them, but he must wait till he have reached a certain level.\"My Devil skills although have big advantages, but there are also some disadvantages, but it is still possible to eliminate the effects!\"Bai Youyou transmitted to him:\"My devil skill is called Engulfing devil skill, and with this you will be able to engulf others true Qi, while the other person's true Qi will be a.s.similated into your body, so you will be able to rob that man's entire strength.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44:Special GiftTranslated and edited by:AshEngulfing devil skill!Heard this, Chen Xiang suddenly got shocked, he stood there in daze like a statue, pa.s.sers-by were looking at him with a strange look in their eyes.\"Do not be surprised, if not for this, my devil will not be called devil skill!Engulfing devil skill has three rules.First, never engulf anyone with huge difference between his and your power level.Second, never engulf a good person, otherwise you will feel guilty and will have evil thoughts, at last will lead you to turn into a devil.Third, never allow anyone to know you have this devil skill, otherwise you will be besieged by the right way martial artists.\"Listening to Bai Youyou ice cold voice, Chen Xiang complexion turned more and more solemn, this devil skill is indeed formidable, you can seize others power level, but he also knew that if he frequently used this devil skill it will have a big effect on his cultivation.\"After you cast this once, you have to make sure you have refined all of their engulfed true Qi, furthermore you have to make sure that the entire true Qi is pure as much as possible, otherwise you will never be able to engulf a second time.\"Bai Youyou voice was cold as well as serious.Chen Xiang took a deep breath, to cast this devil skill, he have to prepare his heart.\"I will now pa.s.s it on to you, casting this devil skill you have to be careful that there must be no other person present, and as you engulf other person he will definitely die.\"While Bai Youyou spoke, she also transferred some information in his mind using her divine sense, this information was the casting method of Engulfing devil skill.It is possible to engulf other power with this skill, although this exercise is malicious, but on the other hand it is also very profound, so Chen Xiang was very eager to understand this profound Engulfing devil skill, he wants to see through every ins and outs of this skill.\"Do not presume to see through this devil skill, not to mention you, even I do not have the ability, this devil skill creator was one peerless genius, every exercise he ever created was great as well as frightening.\"Admiration could clearly be felt in Bai Youyou's voice.Chen Xiang also started to admire this man, after getting the devil skill Chen Xiang starts walking toward the Black wind gang location, Black wind gang is one of the underworld gang in King city, although on surface it is clean, but they have been secretly responsible for a lot of shady things going on inside King city, they had even set up a headquarter in King city, from this Chen Xiang determined Black wind gang certainly have a patron inside king city, and he suspected this patron is none other than Yao family.Since the disappearance of Yao Tianhua and that Yao family elder, most of the underworld gangs were destroyed, but Black wind gang was still there, from this anyone can easily determine there must be a reason.Black wind gang tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate him, Chen Xiang certainly will not let go of them.Chen Xiang saw a big mansion in some distance, while loud sounds were bursting out from the inside and he could even hear it at that distance, after some time Chen Xiang finally remembered that a few days ago Black wind gang started preparing for their leaders 70th birthday, and this birthday feast is now being held.Chen Xiang's mouth slightly rose, revealing a cold smile, Black wind gang sent people to kill him, and they have certainly acquired lot of benefits, but moreover they think they have succeeded.Although there is a rule that'n.o.body can fight inside King city', but for personal matter it was still possible to fight, not to mention they tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate Chen Xiang.At this time Black wind gang's mansion front door suddenly opened up, and dozens of guard came from inside, when they saw Chen Xiang's attire was neither magnificent nor luxurious, they hastily put away their drink and asked:\"Who are you?\"Chen Xiang glanced at them like they were nothing, with a look of disdain said:\"Chen Xiang of Dan king hall!\"Those dozen or so guards suddenly got surprised for a moment, they have already heard of Chen Xiang but have never seen him, they have not expected for Chen Xiang to come here, but today is their leader\u2019s birthday, furthermore Black wind gang and Yao family are very close, and now that he had appeared here, they can easily guess his purpose.\"What are you doing here?Our chief never invited you!\"One of the guard said, his tone was neither tough nor harsh, he didn't dare to, after all Chen Xiang is but one 7th realm of mortal martial realm martial artists, even more so he is one of the youngest alchemist, his status cannot be compared with Chen Xiang.One of the guard ran quickly to inform, these guards are not able to handle this kind of matter, and Chen Xiang was being sly and difficult, he was simply standing in front of the entrance.Not too long after, the noises from inside died down, from his divine sense he gathered many with strength from fifth to seventh level of mortal martial realm people were coming towards him, Chen Xiang was secretly astonished, he did not think that this Black wind gang leader had contacts with people with that level of strength, unexpectedly he also knew that person very well.Chen Xiang both hands were behind his back, standing very relaxed in front of the entrance, with a steady gaze watching those congregation of people wearing luxurious gown coming towards him from inside.These people mostly have middle-aged appearance, Chen Xiang although have been staying in King city for quite some time, but he had no contact with other martial arts family, but he can still guess that these people should have relatively good reputation and position in those martial arts family, even some of them would be patriarch of their family.Everyone were watching the proud and clank teenager, seeing that calm look on his face, they could not help but secretly praise him inside their hearts, for them it was unbelievable that Chen Xiang is only sixteen year old and their family\u2019s teenaged boys and girls are not even his match.\"Chen family young master, today is my birthday, if it is not a sudden matter, I want to enjoy my birthday, if possible can we discuss it another day.\"Black wind gang\u2019s leader is one vigorous and healthy elder, the black leather cloak he was wearing gave him a more prestigious look, but when he saw Chen Xiang, a hint of shock flashed through his pair of eagle like eyes.Chen Xiang also caught on that shocked expression in his eyes, while thinking about it he smiled, with clear and resonant voice said:\"Chief Hei, I came here to tell you one thing, today as I was coming from outside, I encountered some people posing as Black wind gang members and I killed them.\"Black Wind gang\u2019s leader pupil immediately fiercely contracted, he asked:\"How do you know they were not Black wind gang members?\"Chen Xiang slightly raised his lips, smiled and said:\"Although they had three hundred people, but------they still were killed by me, I think Black wind gang is not so weak.\"As early as today, Black wind gang leader received an information, a fire broke out inside the forest, and they had not heard from those three hundred people they have sent, and now seeing Chen Xiang is back safe and unharmed, chief Hei's heart sank low with disappointment.After Black wind gang\u2019s leader heard Chen Xiang words, his facial muscle started twitching, because all those three hundred people were very important to Black wind gang, but he cannot even acknowledge that they were his Black wind gang members.Several of people standing behind Black wind gang\u2019s leader faces were full of surprise, Chen Xiang guessed that they must have known Black wind gang sent someone to kill him, so these people must be from Yao family.\"I said it right, Chief Hei?Some forces were pretending to be your gang members, they must have wanted to tarnish your reputation.\"Chen Xiang smiled and said:\"I wanted to give you this information myself, consider it as your birthday present from me.\"Black wind gang\u2019s leader's eyes s.h.i.+vered, his eyes were filled with both anger and sorrow, because those three hundred people were led by his son, and his son had said that he and the other wanted to give him Chen Xiang's head as birthday present, but he has not thought that they all would be killed by Chen Xiang!\"Chen Xiang--------\"Black wind gang\u2019s leader suddenly yelled, Chen Xiang halted his steps after he heard the shout.Chen Xiang twisted his head, while looking indifferent and a smile on his face, he asked:\"Chief Hei, what's the matter?\"Black wind gang\u2019s leader sound was trembling, he reluctantly squeezed out two words from his mouth:\"Many thanks!\"\"No problem!\"Chen Xiang slightly smiled, and then strode away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45:Opening soonTranslated and Edited By:AshOnly two days are left until King city martial tournament starts, but still there is no information about Yao family genius Yao Tianhua, due to this whole Yao family were anxiously jumping around, Yao Tianhua is but one rare good seedling that was born in Yao family, although he was somewhat arrogant, but Yao family thought it is natural, but now whether he is alive or death is still unknown, and they don't have any information.Chen Xiang returned from Black wind gang mansion, but he did not see his father in Dan king hall.\"GrandUncle, where is my father?\"Chen Xiang quickly asks Chen Luzhong.\"He is now alright, you don't need to worry about him, and he has now returned to Chen family, he is preparing to convene each branch family against Chen Furong!\"Chen Luzhong spoke while laughing:\"Your father is not someone who will lay down his arms easily, Chen Furong destroyed the Chen family rules and regulations, not only that he injured patriarch but he also tried to meddle in Chen family affairs, furthermore he is also helping Chen family enemies, due to this, Chen Furong must be expelled from Chen family.\"Chen Furong just for his selfish reasons is helping out Yao family to deal with Chen family, entire Chen family members are furious due to this, and now Chen Tianhu is treating Chen Furong as number one enemy of Chen family, only after getting rid of this problem--Chen Furong, will make Chen family unite together and become formidable.Chen Xiang complexion turned solemn, he asked:\"GrandUncle, Chen Furong is one of those martial arts sect's disciple, is our Chen family prepare to make enemies with that martial arts sect.\"Chen Luzhong shook his head and said:\"Rest a.s.sured, inside those martial arts sect there are rules, if the disciple stir up some trouble and they die due to it, then it\u2019s n.o.body\u2019s fault but the disciple\u2019s, humph, dignified great sect's disciple, actually they are just lower characters who are sent here to manage these things, if killed here they couldn't care less.\"If those martial arts sects did not have rules to restrain their disciples, then one martial arts expert can casually dominate the secular world, and then it would be a total chaos.Chen Xiang now have lot of confidence, if that\u2019s the case, he will not have any other concerns.\"Granduncle, Dan king hall will finally be open for business tomorrow, tell Meng Lao to be ready completely, while you\u2019re at it simultaneously announce it to whole Southern martial empire.\"Chen Xiang said loudly in an excited voice.Dan king hall already have lot of pills in reserves, moreover they can restrict their sales anytime they want, furthermore there are many alchemists inside Dan king hall who are continuously refining pills, and also Meng Bo is here, so Chen Xiang is pretty much a.s.sured.Chen Luzhong is also very excited, his old face is full of joy, he already had ambitions to make his mark in King city, but as he did not have enough manpower, he can only stay in Wohu city.To open a pill shop in King city, you need to have a backing of someone with very strong heritage and strength.Information spread quickly like a fire, long before the information spread everyone were very much concerned about Dan king hall, they already knew it is managed by Chen family, and Chen and Yao family are hostile to each other, so both will try to seize the market and will compete with their prices, and as a result they will be able to buy pills cheaply, which for those martial artists who are not very wealthy is but one good thing.Yao family for many, many years have been selling pills alone in King city, Danxiang herbal manor mainly sells spirit herbs, so everyone have no alternative but to buy high-priced pills from Yao family, but not for long, and this will allow them to save them a lot of money.At night, Chen Xiang took a bath and put on luxurious clothes, while walking towards Danxiang herbal manor when he thinks about that charming manor lord, Chen Xiang's could not help but got excited a little.After notifying his arrival, Chen Xiang once again came inside the small hall filled with Hua Yueyun aroma, to his surprise Hua Yueyun was already here waiting for him, when Chen Xiang saw her enchanting figure, he could not help but stand in daze with amazement.Hua Yueyun was wearing a dress st.i.tched from purple chiffon, but she was not wearing any undergarments, the dress outlining her jade like body features, her clear and well-rounded bosom, slim waist, slender legs, her every move capable of seizing and moving any man's mind, obsequious in myriads ways, others are not even able to extricate themselves.......Chen Xiang even had trouble breathing, he blushed red up to his ears, his heart crazily starts pounding.\"Chen young master, is little miss pretty?\"Hua Yueyun with a cheeky laugh asked in a charming voice, her jade like foot treading lightly on the soft rug as she walkes towards Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang fiercely swallowed his saliva, then sat, he immediately pour himself a cup of tea, and drank it all one breath, dispersing away the heat arose in his body a moment ago, and he did not dare to look at that attractive Hua Yueyun again.\"Chen young master's control over his mind is very impressive, this little miss is full of admiration, if possible, little miss is willing to attend Chen young master for lifetime, I want to become Chen young master maidservant.\"Hua Yueyun faintly said, looking completely sincere, as if she was not capable of telling any lies, she came up with one snow white colour dress to wear, which entirely covered her enticing jade like perfect body, she clearly knew in front of Chen Xiang she will just bring disgrace on herself.She was almost bare naked standing front of one man, and only able to tempt him slightly, then he even did not take a look at her, which was a big blow to Hua Yueyun.\"Yueyun elder sister, please let off this little brother, do not joke with this little brother!You are so beautiful and strong, so why bother this little brother?\"Chen Xiang smiled, because these days Danxiang herbal manor have been selling herbs cheaply to Dan king hall, so he was very grateful, he did not know that this Danxiang herbal manor lord had this kind of hobby, and actually liked to lure young innocent boys.Hua Yueyun slightly pouted, after a light'Humph'said:\"Chen young master, I really want to be your maidservant, I have long been attracted by your charm and cannot get away with it.........\"What charm, Chen Xiang do not believe any of the things what Hua Yueyun previously said, he knew this is Hua Yueyun\u2019s goal, it has nothing to do with his charm but she simply fancies his alchemy talent, and wants him to enroll in Danxiang Taoyuan;that alchemy based sect.Chen Xiang with a hollow laugh said:\"Manor lord Hua, I have a fianc\u00e9e, and if I accept you as my maidservant, that little girl will surely be jealous.\"\"I know you are looking down on me.\"Hua Yueyun had a self-deprecating smile on her face:\"What did you come here for?\"Chen Xiang took out a small piece of h.e.l.l spirit gra.s.s and handed it to Hua Yueyun, and seriously spoke:\"Yueyun, this is my thank you for providing your help to Dan king hall, and I hope to continue this relations.h.i.+p in the future, I also want you to raise the price a little higher when you sell your herbs to Yao family.\"Hua Yueyun unceremoniously took that thumb size h.e.l.l spirit gra.s.s, albeit only a little, but it was very precious, with a big smile on her face said:\"Chen young master is really generous, this little miss will certainly do whatever you order, if this Danxiang herbal manor would have been mine, I would have given you all the spirit herbs for free.\"Chen Xiang was startled for a moment, looking at that stunning Yaoxing face, he secretly thought of taking her as his maidservant, but he was worried that this woman has some ulterior motive.\"Dan king hall will open tomorrow, and all of it is managed by my granduncle, I want to start my preparation for King city martial arts tournament so I will not be present, if it is convenient to you, can you come to Dan king hall and advertise about us.\"Chen Xiang laughed.\"No problem, will do.\"Hua Yueyun this time was like a maidservant, Chen Xiang wasn't able to stand it anymore, he and Hua Yueyun talked about several nonsensical stuff and then he quickly departed.Watching Chen Xiang fleeing like tail between his legs, Hua Yueyun pretty eyes lit up, tenderly spat and said:\"Really is a tough brat, even able to defend against my killer move, the more he wants to run, the more I want to get him.\"Chen Xiang as always came outside to practice, his goal is to make Chen family reside in this King city, and become one potentially strong martial arts aristocratic family, only after this will he be relieved and go to those big sects, as for Dan king hall he doesn't care much about it, because it is personally taken care by dan king Meng Bo and Chen Luzhong, furthermore it is tacitly supported by Hua Yueyun, so he is simply focusing on elevating his strength.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: New enemies and old debtsChen Xiang just entered into the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, so now he is trying to stabilise his new found power. This will allow him to more smoothly cast \u201cEngulfing Devil Skill\u201d in the future.The next day at noon, Chen Xiang left the forest and returned to King City. He was curious on how the sales of Dan King Hall were going.Chen Xiang, while walking down the avenue, saw Dan King Hall from quite some distance away, but he did not expect it to be so busy. This made him feel strange so he quickly walked towards it.When he arrived at the entrance, he saw that the whole shop was in a bit of a mess. Chen Luzhong was full of anger while directing others to clean it all up.Dan King Hall was attacked, Chen Xiang was extremely sure of that.\u201cGranduncle, I\u2019m back.\u201d Chen Xiang quickly stepped inside. After seeing the pale face on Chen Luzhong he frowned and asked \u201cGranduncle, who attacked you!?\u201dChen Xiang was completely furious. He decided that as long as he managed to get a name out from Chen Luzhong\u2019s mouth, he would immediately go and get revenge. He would make them pay a heavy price for what they have done.\u201cI was wounded by Chen Furong. And the Black Wing Gang members are the ones responsible for the destruction of the store. Not only that, but they also wounded the workers, thankfully Meng Lao and the other alchemists were in seclusion for refining dans so they are all fine!\u201dAfter saying so, Chen Luzhong hastily grabbed Chen Xiang \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201dWhen Chen Xiang learned that it was the Black Wing Gang who did this, he was seething with fury inside. Not only did they send a.s.sa.s.sins before to kill him, which is a debt that must be repaid, but now they even attacked the store!Chen Xiang coldly replied \u201cGranduncle, let me go. I must get rid of the Black Wing Gang once and for all. I\u2019ll go and settle old grudges and new debts all together! You go ahead and inform father that he needs to be completely prepared for a war with the Yao Family. If our Chen Family wants to have a stand in King City, we need to make an example out of the Yao Family and completely frighten all other forces.\u201d\u201cYou want to go alone? No, I will also with you!\u201d Chen Luzhong said.\u201cNo, you need to go and first speak with Meng Lao. Dan King Hall will continue to remain open. At this time, if anyone comes to trouble us, they must be mercilessly slaughtered.\u201d Chen Xiang then walked away. Although Meng Bo and Chen Luzhong\u2019s individual strength was incomparable to Chen Furong\u2019s, if they fought together Chen Furong would have to pay a steep price to defeat both of them.Along the way, Chen Xiang overheard many things about Dan King Hall. Many people were very disappointed. Dan King Hall\u2019s prices were much cheaper than the Yao Family Dans and once they started selling dans it would have a large negative impact on the Yao Family. As such, the Yao Family wanted to bully Dan King Hall into closing.Although it meant there is no morals involved, and the methods were downright brutal, n.o.body could complain about them. This is because the Yao Family is one of the powerhouses in King City and no one wanted to be their enemy.\u201cYao Family, just you wait and watch how I will destroy you!\u201d Chen Xiang complexion gradually turned gloomy as his anger skyrocketed.At the Black Wing Gang mansion entrance, many guards were present. When they saw Chen Xiang heading towards them, they hastily drew out their weapons.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, all of you leave at once!\u201d Chen Xiang stood emotionless at the Black Wing Gang Mansion entrance. He clenched his fists, which suddenly became covered with a buzzling azure aura. Amidst the azure aura, lighting was bursting out one after the other emitting a horrifying crackling noise, it was truly frightening.Everyone didn\u2019t want to die, they were all overawed by the sheer amount of True Qi emanating from Chen Xiang\u2019s fists. They knew they were nothing but ants in front of Chen Xiang so they immediately ran away.The gate was tightly shut. Chen Xiang stood in front of it as lighting flashed past his eyes. With a shout, he circulated the Azure Dragon Lighting True Qi on both of his fists and then fiercely hurled them towards that door. It was as if two giant dragons were pounding on the gates.\u201cBOOM, BOOM, BOOM\u201dThat thick door instantly disintegrated into powder. Smoke billowed about as all the guards present were stunned. Trembling, they realized that if it was their body there, it would have also been turned into dust like the gate.\u201cThis\u2026 This is the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm! I\u2019m absolutely sure that was Aura Qi!\u201d One of the guards immediately shouted with shock after seeing how Chen Xiang entered the mansion.According to the rumors, Chen Xiang was in the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Yet now he was clearly at the 7th level, it was too much to take in. All the guards secretly let loose a deep breath, had they tried to block him, it could have only resulted in certain death.After entering inside the mansion, Chen Xiang\u2019s entire body was covered in a soaring Evil Qi. He had been practicing Slaughtering Heart, and now all the killing intent was boiling over. All the previously acc.u.mulated Slaughter Qi gushed out, deterring many retained and maidservants and forcing them to kneel. Thier whole body felt weak as they lied down. This is what makes Slaughtering Heart so formidable, merely the Qi only is capable of deterring the other party.\u201cWho has come here to cause trouble with the Black Wing Gang!?\u201d Chen Xiang halted his footsteps when he heard the shout.\u201cDan King Hall\u2019s Chen Xiang! Underlings of the Yao Family\u2019s stooges, today I will make sure the entire Black Wind Gang disappears from King City!\u201d Chen Xiang said in a heavy tone.Chen Xiang saw a blade of light flas.h.i.+ng from the front. A person armed with a broadsword was leaping from quite a while away and aiming at his head.\"Humph!\"Chen Xiang just snorted in disdain, lightly waving his hand. An Azure Aura rich in Lighting Qi Aura madly gushed out from his hand. It shoot like a speeding star towards the man leaping up in the air. One could only hear the sound of an explosion, the man didn\u2019t even have the chance to cry before his whole body suddenly bursted into a mist of blood.The Lighting Aura Power is extremely frightening! Many of the Black Wind Gang Members after seeing the blood mist drifting in the air and the shattered blade became petrified. For them, it was the first time seeing such a frightening attack. With just one move, an expert of the Black Wind Gang was crushed, moreover not even a slag was left after the attack.Chen Xiang is in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Skills of such experts are not common to begin with, not to mention how Chen Xiang has been using Divine Exercises to cultivate. Moreover, he also has the Five Element Attributed True Qi!\u201cYou walked right into my trap Chen Xiang! Today, I will not allow you to leave here in once piece. You just killed my son and I\u2019m gonna present your head as a sacrifice for him!\u201d A resentful voice came soon after.Chen Xiang was standing in the middle of a large garden. He was surrounded on all sides by black robed men. At this time, the Black Wind Gang leader appeared, and at his side were a few people standing in luxurious attire.It was quite a surprise to Chen Xiang that the King City Governor, Hua Gaoyun, was actually present. A single teenager stood besides him, it should be his son.Chen Xiang sneered \u201cSo your son is allowed to kill me, but I\u2019m not allowed to kill him? Not to mention he even brought along three hundred people with him, yet he was still killed by me. They were just a big pile of trash, no one is to blame for his death except himself!\u201d\u201cWorthy of the rumors, Chen Family young master. Could it be that you do not know about your own family\u2019s situation? Your wastrel father has been wounded and Dan King Hall was destroyed. Yet you actually dare to show your face here!? You\u2019re simply seeking death!\u201d One middle aged man dressed in a Golden Huafu sneered and retorted.Chen Xiang\u2019s body shook as mesmerizing lighting aura surged out. His eyes were filled to the brim with hate as he glared towards that middle aged man, saying \u201cWhat did you just say!? My Father is tras.h.!.+?\u201d\u201cSo what if I said that. Remember this great master\u2019s name, w.a.n.g Yushan! I\u2019m the Patriarch of the w.a.n.g Family!\u201d That middle-aged man said proudly.The w.a.n.g family is one of the martial art families of King City, but Chen Xiang didn\u2019t have any strong impressions of them. But in return, the families that lie outside King City do not even appear in their sights, therefore they naturally didn\u2019t pay any attention to the Chen Family.\u201cHumph, so it was only a family of dogs licking the Yao Family\u2019s boots. I do not even consider you a threat.\u201d Chen Xiang sneered. These puny families trying to flatter the Yao Family was not much of a surprise to him.\u201cLittle b.a.s.t.a.r.d! How dare you insult the w.a.n.g Family! I\u2019ll definitely waste you today!\u201d w.a.n.g Yishan flew into a rage. Although Chen Xiang\u2019s speech was ugly, it was still the truth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Exterminatedw.a.n.g Yishan roared before his body was covered in a golden aura. It was as if his entire body was on fire. This was the w.a.n.g Family\u2019s unique King True Qi and it gave off an incomparably fierce pressure. w.a.n.g Yishan took a few steps before blasting his golden fist into the air towards Chen Xiang. A tough and powerful Qi burst out accompanied by a roar. In a blink of an eye, the pressure had been directly thrusted into the face of Chen Xiang.The aura filled strike rumbled as it dashed forward, leaving behind a trail of explosions that caused all the nearby stones to shatter into several pieces. A deep gully was formed, it was as if the floor had just been ploughed. Seeing this, the crowd s.h.i.+vered. If someone got hit with that kind of power, they would be reduced to nothing but mincemeat.\u201cWith only this level of power you dare claim to be a patriarch!?\u201d My dad could crush you with one hand behind his back!\u201d Chen Xiang smiled contemptuously as he waved his arm fiercely, instantly striking the incoming Qi Aura and scattering it into nothingness.Everyone could not avoid the sensation of shock. Chen Xiang just waved his hand like he was shooing away a fly, but instead that fearsome Qi Aura was easily swept away in front of the shocked onlookers.Chen Xiang\u2019s Qi Aura rushed out with just a wave of his hand, and he was able to completely eliminate w.a.n.g Yishan\u2019s blow. This in itself was indisputable proof that Chen Xiang\u2019s Qi Aura was many times stronger than w.a.n.g Yishan\u2019s.w.a.n.g Yishan\u2019s confidence and arrogance had vanished into thin air after just one light wave of Chen Xiang\u2019s hand. This made him doubt that whether his Qi Aura was able to unleash and display its full potential, but just by looking at the gully formed by his Qi Aura he realized that this was not the case. As he thought about it again, his whole body shook as he realized he was no match for Chen Xiang\u2019s formidable strength.Currently, w.a.n.g Yishan, along with everyone else, stood in a stunned daze. With a flicker, Chen Xiang arrived in front of w.a.n.g Yishan with frightening speed which once again sent everyone into shock.Before w.a.n.g Yishan was even able to react, he felt a severe pain explode from his abdomen. He immediately lowered his head and saw an arm cloaked in Azure True Qi. It had cleanly penetrated through his stomach and extended out of his back.\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d w.a.n.g Yishan loudly shrieked. At this time Chen Xiang had already ripped away his arm. He had just used [Azure Dragon Claw], transforming his True Qi into a sharp dragon claw. It sharpness could with ease penetrate a hard bolder, let alone the fragile human body.True Qi was still wrapped around his arm, revealing not a single bloodstain left from that brutal strike. Looking at the pale w.a.n.g Yishan in front of him, Chen Xiang coldly stated \u201cGet away from my sight. This is between me and the Black Wing Gang. You brought this upon yourself when you stepped in between us. For now I\u2019ll spare you dog life and let you take a look at the true strength of our Chen Family.\u201dw.a.n.g Yishan was completely shocked by Chen Xiang\u2019s strength. Although his heart was filled to the brim with resentment, he did not dare say anything in reply. In the end, he reluctantly crawled away as a few people came to his aid, taking him away from the Black Wing Gang\u2019s mansion.Chen Xiang focused his eyes towards the Black Wind Gang\u2019s Leader. Azure lighting was flas.h.i.+ng within his eyes as Slaughter Qi started to soar out from his entire body. After sweeping his gaze through everyone present, he eventually reached the Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader. Chen Xiang coldly stated \u201cIf any you meddle in things which you\u2019re not supposed to, don\u2019t blame me for what happens. You and I don\u2019t have any deep grudges, and I don\u2019t want to take any needless actions which would waste my strength.\u201dGovernor Hua Gaoyun was an expert of the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Although his overall strength was a lot higher than w.a.n.g Yishan\u2019s, when he had witnessed Chen Xiang\u2019s performance and skills, Hua Gaoyun was extremely conflicted. Even if he faced Chen Xiang and somehow won, Hua Gaoyun was dead certain that he would not get through it unscathed.It would obviously not be beneficial for him, and he could clearly see this point. Otherwise he would have never become a Governor of King City. He saw that the Black Wind Gang\u2019s Leader has offended a young alchemist with immeasurable potential. It was simply not worth it, not even adding into the equation that the Chen Family was not to be trifled with.Without any delay, Hua Gaoyun took his son and instantly left. As for the Black Wind Gang\u2019s Leader, he couldn\u2019t stop the current progression of things. This was because he already knew that after today, the Black Wind Gang would cease to exist in King City.He could only stand by and watch as everyone he invited left one by one. Although he was extremely angry, he dared not to attack and force them to stay.\"Attack him together, he is just one person!\" The Black Wind Gang's Leader yelled as he rushed towards Chen Xiang wielding a long black spear.Just like an angry dragon, Chen Xiang madly roared as powerful Qi Aura waves rippled outwards with Chen Xiang as the origin. Wherever they went, only destruction followed. The bricks it breezed past were crushed into dust. Flowers and trees within the garden suddenly looked like they had been slashed by thousands of blades. Everyone present in the garden started to scream out miserably and their seven apertures started bleeding. As they were covered in scars that sprang up one after another in an endless loop, the entire group quickly fell down on the ground.This move of Chen Xiang\u2019s burst out vigorous amounts of aura Qi along with a sonic attack. Although the consumption of energy was tremendous, the power and range of the attack was equally astonis.h.i.+ng.Only the Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader was left standing. Over a thousand of his Black Wind Gang members were now lying on the ground, dead. It was unbelievable that they were taken out just by a single sixteen year old teenager who had such a vicious and fearsome True Qi.The Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader felt his heart constrict in terror, only now did he know what kind of person he had messed with.\"HAHAHAHA!\" The Black Wind Gang's Leader suddenly start laughing maniacally.\"What are you laughing about?\" Chen Xiang asked as he slowly advanced step by step towards him.\"I\u2019m laughing because the Yao Family will not let off your Chen Family. Your entire Chen Family will perish.\" With a grim smile, the Black Wind Gang\u2019s Leader replied. In a flash Chen Xiang came in front of him, forcing out his vigorous True Qi he transformed it into Qi Aura and fired a powerful punch. The Black Wind Gang\u2019s Leader flew like a rag doll, cras.h.i.+ng into a house on the distant horizon.Chen Xiang quickly flew towards him. Entering into the house he gripped the Black Wind Gang's Leader's head, shouting in his heart \u201c[Engulfing Devil Skill]!\"This Black Wind Gang's Leader was in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. The amount of True Qi in his body was not bad, but he was facing Chen Xiang. In front of this monster, the Black Wind Gang's Leader was completely helpless and utterly vulnerable.As Chen Xiang cast the [Engulfing Devil Skill] for the first time, he felt a large amount of True Qi surging into his arm, heading straight to his body. This True Qi was very oppressive and it swirled around in his body. The entire process made him feel uncomfortable, but it was not to an unbearable degree.The Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader howled in despair, his heart in endless dismay. He had never dreamed that Chen Xiang could actually draw out the internal True Qi within his body and then absorb it. This martial skill was extremely frightening, if a righteous sect came to learn about it, they would certainly hunt Chen Xiang down.Chen Xiang had refined his body within the Immortal and Devil Pond. His bones, muscles and meridians were all incomparably tough. It was actually enough to withstand this sudden surge of True Qi, thus stopping his body from exploding.It was also the reason that Bai Youyou had dared to teach him this devil skill, because this technique required a very tough body.In just a short moment, the Black Wind Gang's Leader hard cultivated True Qi had been entirely deprived by Chen Xiang. As a result the Black Wind Gang's Leader died shortly after. Chen Xiang was also having a hard time, he wanted to suppress and reign in this oppressive True Qi, otherwise it would be very troublesome.At this moment, Chen Xiang was not thinking about looting Black Wind Gang, but instead hurried to incinerate the Black Wind Gang's Leader body before swiftly leaving. If a Yao Family expert came he would be in a very big trouble, also he was in a hurry to completely refine this True Qi.Currently his strength was comparable to the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm. Reaching this level of power in itself was very frightening. It must be known that in the entire Southern Martial Empire, only a few martial artists had reached the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm.In Dan King Hall's backyard, Chen Xiang arrived and quickly entered a private room deep below the earth. When Chen Luzhong saw Chen Xiang's dignified complexion, he did not dare ask anything. If only Meng Bo hadn't gone into seclusion to refine pills, Dan King Hall wouldn't have been destroyed.\u201cThe Black Wind Gang had been destroyed.\u201d This news soon spread through the whole of King City. In the morning. they had gone to Dan King Hall looking to stir up trouble, but in that very same afternoon, the entire gang was completely eradicated. Not only this, but it was also done by Chen Xiang alone. King City's residents were all amazed by Chen Xiang's strength, and at this point they had a new understanding of just how powerful Chen Xiang was.Although many people had died, n.o.body came forward to address these things, nor did they want to intervene. Although the Imperial Palace had the Emperor, even they did not dare to provoke these powerful figures as they knew very well about the formidability of these martial experts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Divine Power RealmAlthough the Black Wind Gang was exterminated, there was no movement in the Yao Family. It was well known that the Black Wind Gang were the Yao Family\u2019s lackeys. Many people guessed that the Yao Family was busy preparing for the upcoming King City\u2019s Martial Tournament, as well as searching for their missing Yao Family Elder and genius.Dan King Hall was quickly restored to its former brilliance and was ready to start anew. After the Black Wing Gang\u2019s extermination, all of King City\u2019s citizens were shocked by Dan King Hall\u2019s display of strength. Everyone was now rus.h.i.+ng into Dan King Hall to buy pills, as their pills were far cheaper than the Yao Family\u2019s, soon their dan shops sales took a huge blow.Most of the customers were martial artists who were neither very wealthy nor did they had a huge background. They earned money in order to buy dans and elevate their strengths, as such they just choose whomever sold at a cheaper price. Not to mention, Dan King Hall was managed by the Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Dan King, making these people feel more at ease about their purchases.The main bulk of the sales were Low-Grade Mortal Level Dans, only a few Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans were sold because they were a lot more expensive. High Grade-Mortal Level Dans were sold the least as ordinary people could not afford these dans.Because the Danxiang Herbal Manor constantly supplied cheap spirit herbs, Dan King Hall managed to save a lot of money. Plus, even if Dan King Hall had made a great deal of profit, Chen Xiang simply did not want any of it, and all of it was left for Dan King Hall to use.Even after an entire day had past, Chen Diang was still refining the True Qi he had recently engulfed and forcibly taken from the Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader. This True Qi was very turbid. in order to transform it into the purest form, Chen Xiang had to remove many impurities. This process required a great deal of time.Chen Xiang\u2019s dantian was stuffed full of True Qi and he was currently constantly compressing that True Qi, allowing his dantian to store more and more True Qi, simultaneously trying to break into the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!Operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], the Tai Chi Yin and Yang Diagram in Chen Xiang\u2019s dantian quickly started to rotate. True Qi was constantly entering the Tai Chi Diagram, it then quickly broke into the five elements, swiftly turning into five True Qi vortexes.The 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the unlocking of divine power! At this stage, one could fuse their divine sense and True Qi together, as a result of which the True Qi evolved with a spirit of it's own and which would be even more powerful! Their aura would also become a lot stronger, exponentially more powerful compared to those in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.In order to advance into the 8th level, one first needs to have vigorous True Qi and a strong divine sense. As Chen Xiang had fully absorbed all of the Black Wing Gang Leader\u2019s True Qi, there was no doubt that Chen Xiang\u2019s total True Qi was quite vigorous. Plus, after his body was refined in the Immortal and Devil Pool, his spirit was exceptionally strong. As his current divine sense could not be considered weak, as soon as he grasped the method to fuse his divine sense and True Qi together, he would be able to breakthrough.The Mortal Martial Realm was divided into ten stages, and during each breakthrough it was like opening a giant locked gate, having to force it open with brute force at each stage. Not only does it need a certain amount of power, but one also needed to comprehend certain tricks.Currently Chen Xiang had more than enough power, he just needed to comprehend how to fuse his True Qi and divine sense. As soon as he does, he can unlock that door and enter into the 8th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the realm of Divine Power!By operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] he was slowly comprehending the profound secrets of this divine exercise. Chen Xiang's True Qi and divine sense gradually fused together. The invisible divine sense melded together with the colorful True Qi. These two powerful forces slowly fused together as something seemed to burst open in Chen Xiang's body. Endless strength emerged constantly in a steady stream and continued onwards to impact his meridians, muscles, and bones...\u201cThud\u201d In Chen Xiang\u2019s mind a sound suddenly resounded. It was as if a heavy gate had just been opened. In a steady but swift stream, an endless flow of power surged from this opening into his body, thereby enhancing his strength and making it even more tyrannical than before.As Chen Xiang opened his eyes, two white beams emitted as the golden mist enshrouding his body gradually dispersed. At this time, his eyes became clear. He could clearly perceive the tiny dust particles drifting on the ground. He can clearly hear far off sounds from every direction, but he didn\u2019t think it was noisy. He could clearly identify what each sound was, what each and every person was saying amongst those chaotic noises.In the most crucial time, Chen Xiang had entered into the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Divine Power realm!He was also just about to reach seventeen years of age.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------King City\u2019s Martial Art Tournament was held once every decade. Only those twenty or younger could partic.i.p.ate in this grand tourney. This time, it was organized by the Yao Family and supervised by numerous experts from the martial art sects from the Immortal Mountains. Whoever manages to place first in the whole compet.i.tion would not only win a High-Grade Spirit Level True Elemental Dan, but also earn the qualifications to enter one of the observing martial art sects. These were very attractive rewards for anyone.It should be known that Spirit Level Dans were extremely expensive already! In fact, they were generally not sold, those who require them would need to seek out an alchemist to personally refine it. Not to mention, there was always high risk of failure in refining dans, and besides this was a High-Grade Spirit Level True Elemental Dan!Each True Elemental Dan contained a vast amount of pure True Qi. After taking and refining the energy within, the individual absorbing the dan could easily get a large amount of True Qi without going through the long arduous process of absorbing the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth. It was truly a superb dan that could quickly elevate one\u2019s power.Many people applied for the King City\u2019s Martial Art Tournament, but only a select few were able to pa.s.s through the harsh a.s.sessments. In fact, there was merely forty people in total! This showed just how high the requirements to entire King City\u2019s Martial Art Tournament were.During the test, Chen Xiang easily got the highest a.s.sessment. His fist had actually pulverized the strength measuring stone. Even the stone was unable to measure his true power! However, not a single person had yet to notice Chen Xiang\u2019s arrival.The Yao Family\u2019s field was akin to mountain and seas composed of human, with a large sea of people encircling the six feet high and twenty feet in diameter, round martial stage. Standing above the crowd were a total of thirty nine boys and girls... Chen Xiang was still nowhere to be seen.\u201cI heard that two days ago he destroyed the Black Wind Gang, could it be that he was injured and cannot come?\u201d Inside the crowd a person\u2019s voice could be heard.\u201cMost likely, after all I heard that the Black Wing Gang\u2019s Leader was a 7th Level Mortal Martial Realm Expert. Plus, Chen Xiang is rather young. It is highly likely that they were mutually wounded\u201d Another person replied.\u201cEn! No one has seen Chen Xiang within the Dan King Hall in the past two days. It seems like he really cannot come, such a pity.\u201d One man sighed.Everyone watching the tournament was hoping for Chen Xiang\u2019s arrival, yet he had not. Many people were very disappointed, making the arrogant group onstage very unhappy. This was because it was as though the audience thought that Chen Xiang would come and easily get first place.While everyone was talking about Chen Xiang, a figure cloaked in black, with sword like eyebrows and s.h.i.+ny starry eyes, walked up to the stairs of the stage with a clear expression of determination.Watching the calm and handsome boy slowly appear on-stage, the entire field fell silent, before bursting into waves of screams. Chen Xiang had finally come, which made the entire crowd excited.On the stage there were now forty boys and girls, yet Chen Xiang overshadowed them all because of what he wore. Very common black tights, compared to the others who were all luxuriously dressed. Yet in both temperament and build, they were far inferior compared to Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang gave off the impression of a very mature and stable individual, with a faint trace of a smile on his face. All in all, the other boys and girls had a high and mighty att.i.tude, with proud looks on their faces and acting as if the crowd was beneath them. This made everyone watching displeased, comparatively everyone looking at Chen Xiang felt comfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Leng YoulanChen Xiang had just entered the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and his divine sense was already coming in handy. He could tell that there was actually two experts of 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm on the tournament stage, one of whom, was an around twenty year old boy cloaked in a s.h.i.+ning golden aura.The other was a very beautiful girl with soft white hair that was tied into a ponytail. Slim and slender, she looked very beautiful and mature as well, yet also cold and proud. Actually, she was wearing the same type of clothes as Chen Xiang! Black tights, sketching out her perfectly hot figure. However, the quality of her outfit far exceeded that of Chen Xiang\u2019sThis girl was attracting a lot of attention because of her strange white hair, mature appearance, s.e.xy figure, and extremely beautiful but cold and proud face. Even Chen Xiang glanced towards her many times.\u201cThe rules are being announced! The first round will be held today. Forty people will be divided into eight groups of five. The winner of each group will go on to the quarterfinals!\u201d An old man shouted, he was an Yao Family Elder. \u201cFive will fight on stage at a time, the last man standing will be the victor of the group and advance!\u201dThe rules were quite common, five people would fight a battle royale on stage, eliminating each other one by one while the last one standing would be crowned the victor.The Yao Family Elder mainly explained the tournament rules to state that they are allowed to use dirty tricks and tactics, but not allowed to kill.Afterwards, the eight groups were soon formed, and Chen Xiang was not grouped with either of the two 7th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioners. In his group, there were four guys, each around nineteen to twenty year old and at the pinnacle of the 6th Mortal Martial Realm. It seemed like they were just about to breakthrough to the next level. Chen Xiang guessed that the Yao Family had intentionally put him such a group to get him eliminated during the first round of the tournament.At this time, Chen Xiang also learned the ident.i.ties of the two 7th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioners. The girl was called Leng Youlan, and she was the daughter of a famous general of Southern Martial Empire. Yet despite her mature looks, she was only fourteen years old, this made Chen Xiang secretly snarl.The other teenager was called Song Nanming. He was the eldest son of the Emperor. Basically, he was the crown prince of Southern Martial Empire. This year he just turned twenty, and was at pinnacle of 7th level of Mortal Martial Realm. The inherent talent was also good, but in Chen Xiang opinion it was still poor compared to Leng Youlan, because she was only fourteen years old.Chen Xiang\u2019s group was the last to fight, but also the most unbalanced. Not only was Chen Xiang only sixteen years old, but the other group members were nineteen or twenty. Everyone could see that this was intentional. If it was one on one, Chen Xiang would have the highest possibility to win. But if all five people fought in this melee knockout, Chen Xiang may very well be defeated.If it was before, when Chen Xiang was only at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he might have been somewhat worried. But now he was in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and had a lot more strength. Just by stomping his feet on the ground, his feet could shake the whole field. Plus, with the divine exercise and his five elements True Qi, his strength was comparable to that of a 9th level Mortal Martial Realm warrior!Chen Xiang did not actually expect he would breakthrough to the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm just a few days after he entered the 7th level. This was all thanks to the [Engulfing Devil Skill] that was taught to him by Bai Youyou. At that time, he also understood the dangerous lure of devil skills!Cheng Xiang stood among the audiences, watching the first five people as they fought on the tournament stage. He was observing their respective fighting styles and his eyes shone whenever they casted their martial skills. He could clearly see the True Qi flowing in their meridians thanks to his extraordinary divine sense. As such, it was a piece of cake for Chen Xiang to steal and learn their techniques unlike normal people. This was something he could easily imitate and use in the future.All five people were squeezed near the center of the stage. No one wanted to fight near the edge, as once someone steps out, they are eliminated. At this time, they were chaotically fighting in the middle of the stage. This type of chaotic battle also required one to have a certain strength and endurance for them to last long enough to be the last man standing. Sometimes an individual would find themselves facing all other four fighters! Moreover, they all attacked and simultaneously resisted others. From these facts, one could see the partic.i.p.ants capability to use and respond to a martial skill.Although the audience exclaimed with gasps of shock and admiration whenever those five people cast their martial skills, Chen Xiang felt nothing but disdain. Although flashy, there were far too many shortcoming, as such he did not try to steal and learn them.The first round was soon finished, the victor\u2019s strength was good, with vigorous True Qi he lasted until he was the last one left. The other four were not defeated, but rather had to step down as their True Qi had been completely consumed.These boys and girls were in 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. In many people\u2019s eyes, they were geniuses and quite powerful. But Chen Xiang knew their basics were not good, their foundation was unstable. Their True Qi was not vigorous or pure enough. Although their martial skills were good, they were not able to unleash the full power of their martial skills, and they also had horrible accuracy.\u201cWell I suppose they are too sheltered. All their lives, they have been treated as treasures and supported by their families, having not suffered the bitterness of true practice.\u201d Chen Xiang muttered coldly in his heart. However, not many could practice like him, bitterly practicing until the moon started falling.The next round was the Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Crown Prince, Song Nanming\u2019s, turn. He was a martial artist in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, but the others were only in the 6th level. In fact, at the beginning of the round, two quickly fell down from an explosion. Song Nanming then used his advantage of being in 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm to swiftly overcome the other two. The entire audience cheered with excitement after he won.Next, it was the great general\u2019s daughter, Leng Youlan\u2019s, turn. When she stepped on stage, many men in the audience lost their breath as they stared l.u.s.tfully at her figure. Leng Youlan was wearing black tights. With her slim, slender and flexible legs, her appearance really did not match her age. The mature and graceful body emanated a cold and proud temperament. It was hard for anyone to imagine that this girl was only fourteen years old.\u201cThe True Qi from this girl is very strange!\u201d Chen Xiang frowned and whispered.Su Meiyao replied \u201cThis girl has a Fire-Ice Vein, what rank it is, I can\u2019t tell. The True Qi that she practices must be fire and ice True Qi. When these two opposing types of True Qi fuse, they become like this, strange and unpredictable. If you face her flames, it is very possible that they would be able to freeze you. In short, this little girl is marvellous and extraordinary. It would probably be for the best if you became friends with her.\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s pupils contracted. Watching that mature and charming figure on the stage, he was secretly shocked in his heart. Someone who could obtain Su Meiyao\u2019s acknowledgments would definitely not be ordinary.\u201cStart!\u201dAs the sound faded away, Leng Youlan suddenly turned into a black shadow which rushed around the stage. Seemingly dragging something that looked like a long black ghost, her speed was so fast that the audience clicked their tongues in amazement. They weren\u2019t alone as the four men on stage were also stunned.Chen Xiang\u2019s brow wrinkled, even he could barely make out Leng Youlan\u2019s beautiful but serious face. But this act made his eyes extremely strained, her fast speed surprised even him!\u201cBANG!\u201d A sound suddenly came as one of the partic.i.p.ants on stage suddenly flew off. Although most people did not see how the man was beaten down, everyone realized it must have been the quick Leng Youlan. In fact, only her shadow was visible to most of the audience at this point.However Chen Xiang saw clearly that Leng Youlan sent out a powerful kick on the youth. It was actually strong enough that the individual in question flew out after one strike.Leng Youlan quickly struck each of her opponents in such a way that only her silhouette was visible, yet all it took was one kick as each of her compet.i.tors flew out. As the other partic.i.p.ants flew out one by one, everyone cheered.\u201cLeng Youlan has successfully entered the quarter finals! Next is the final group!\u201d The Yao Family Elder shouted.Finally it was Chen Xiang\u2019s turn. Everyone knew that Chen Xiang was going to face four other 6th level Mortal Martial Realm experts, each of them had remained in that realm for many years. They were naturally much stronger than others at the same level, making it even more disadvantageous for Chen Xiang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - PlotAs Chen Xiang stepped onto the stage, his facial expression was completely relaxed. He was in no way anxious because of his four powerful opponents. This calm and confident att.i.tude made others admire him.Chen Xiang stood with the other four on stage, and even though they were twenty years old, they were still shorter, their statures were not as robust as the seventeen year old Chen Xiang\u2019s. He actually looked more healthy and energetic compared to them!Leng Youlan, who was in the audience, seriously watched Chen Xiang. Her cold and beautiful eyes carefully observed Chen Xiang, wanting to see through him. But it was like clouds had covered more clouds, she wasn\u2019t even able to sense Chen Xiang breath.\u201cStart!\u201dThe instant the signal was given, all four of the other partic.i.p.ants rushed towards Chen Xiang extremely quickly. At the same time, they simultaneously blasted out a fist wrapped in vigorous True Qi. Everyone could clearly tell that the four fists emitted a frightening amount of True Qi, it seemed like they could even blast giant mountains into tiny rocks.Chen Xiang simply stood still with both hands behind his back. The four fists fiercely landed on his chest, and bursted into Qi waves which lead to a gust of fierce winds. The whole tournament stage wildly shook and nearly collapsed. At this moment, everyone\u2019s heart seemed to stop. The four fists were so frightening, and had all landed on a single target. Let alone people, even solid iron bars would easily break under such pressure.But Chen Xiang was not an ordinary man. When the four fists struck his chest, his expression did not change in the slightest. In fact, if anything, his face was more relaxed as he stood there, which bathed the entire crowd in silence. Everyone stood dumbly like wooden chickens. Astonishment was clearly visible on every single face in the crowd.Leng Youlan\u2019s brow wrinkled, she was tightly watching Chen Xiang. Her mature, proud and cold face was painted with surprise. Even if she completely exhausted all of her True Qi, she could only barely resist those four fists. Yet not only did Chen Xiang not use any True Qi, he didn\u2019t even prepare himself to defend. This was how casually he received those four blows..Chen Xiang didn\u2019t use True Qi because he had already entered the 8th level of the Mortal Marital Realm. Furthermore, his body was naturally a lot stronger due to the refinement in the Immortal and Devil Pool. For him, opponents in the 6th level and the 1st level of the Mortal Marital Realm were the same, their attacks were merely superficial.Of course, out of everyone present, the most shocked were the four men who attacked Chen Xiang. As their frightening attacks struck Chen Xiang\u2019s body, it felt like everything went down the drain. The enormous strength they had put in their strikes just quietly disappeared, making them all question their own power because of how easily the other side had resisted their combined attacks with nothing but his body.They all openly retreated, if Chen Xiang can casually resist their simultaneous attack and not even flinch, one could only imagine his strength. It was dead certain that he was extremely powerful. Chen Xiang fully opened his eyes fully as the invisible Slaughter Qi emerged from his body. All the four men were bathed in extreme bloodl.u.s.t as their whole bodies froze. It was as if they had fallen into h.e.l.l at the height of it\u2019s slaughter, and Chen Xiang was the G.o.d of Slaughter, and the four men were nothing but lambs lead to the slaughterhouse.\u201cDo you want get down and forfeit, or do you want me to act?\u201d Chen Xiang voice was full of killing intent. This was truly terrifying, this Slaughter Qi resulted from him practicing the [Slaughtering Heart] from the [White Tiger Divine Exercise], which added a spiritual pressure.Chen Xiang\u2019s voice resounded as the four people standing immediately backed off. Under the sweep of his frightening and almost divine killing sense, their spirits had collapsed long ago. With the help of his divine sense, not a single one of them had any intention left of fighting against him.From start to finish, Chen Xiang did not even move. He simply scared away the other four and entered into the quarter finals! This result was outside anyone's expectations, those who had entered into the quarterfinals experienced a large amount of pressure from facing this monster, Chen Xiang. Their chances of winning just diminished greatly.Next was to create four groups of individual one and one fights. This was also managed by the Yao Family, but the match ups had not been announced for quite sometime. Chen Xiang said nothing, in his eyes whoever he had to fight was the same. Even if the Yao Family tried to play dirty tricks, they would all amount to nothing like their attempt just now.Chen Xiang\u2019s next opponent turned out to be a Yao Family member. In fact, it seems like he was the brother of Yao Tianhua. His name was Yao Chong and was only of the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.This actually made Chen Xiang surprised for a moment. But he quickly guessed things were not as they seemed as he was the most clear on the Yao Family\u2019s strength. Not to mention that the Yao Family had arranged for someone from their own family to fight, there was no doubt some form of trickery involved.The Yao Family disciples usually either planted spirit herbs or learned alchemy techniques. From the very start, their strength was way behind others. Yao Tianhua was an exception as he could practice alchemy and have a good amount of power, however he was currently missing. The Yao Family simply did not have any other outstanding disciples.The Yao Family mainly used their dans to attract other families and a large number of wandering martial artists to settle down under their authority.Once again, Chen Xiang was in the last round of the day. Starting tomorrow, there would be two fights each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Chen Xiang wasn\u2019t concerned about anyone, so he didn\u2019t go watch the earlier matches. He felt that the time would be better spent practicing alchemy.Once two days had gone past, and Chen Xiang was walking towards the Yao Family after eating lunch. Although he didn\u2019t go watch the three matches, two yesterday and one in this morning, he still learned who won. The Crown Prince and Leng Youlan both won their respective matches and would fight each other tomorrow morning.\u201cThis match between the Crown Prince and the great general\u2019s daughter should be very interesting. Perhaps I\u2019ll go and watch tomorrow.\u201d Chen Xiang made a quick mental note as he stepped on the tournament stage, waiting for Yao Chong to arrive.As for Chen Xiang\u2019s and Yao Chong\u2019s fight, everyone thought that Chen Xiang would easily win. However, they were uncertain why the Yao Family would allow Chen Xiang to face Yao Chong, it was like sending him to do a thankless and pointless job.\u201cYou display of strength clearly shows your worth as someone who defeated Tianhua. I hope Brother Chen will show some leniency.\u201d Yao Chong approached Chen Xiang and said with a smile.Yao Chen and Yao Tianhua looked somewhat similar. A sliver of pride could be easily seen on either of their faces, but it seemed more subdued on Yao Chen\u2019s.Chen Xiang did not actually care about this Yao Family junior or his courtesy. Chen Xiang smiled and said \u201cThen we can compare notes on our martial arts.\u201dThe two quickly separated from each other.\u201cStart!\u201dThe instant the signal was given, Chen Xiang saw a hint of ruthlessness and cunningness appear in Yao Chong\u2019s eyes. Chen Xiang was slightly surprised in his heart, but knew that there was some dirty trickery ahead. Yao Chong took the initiative as he leapt towards Chen Xiang. Both of Yao Chong\u2019s fists were cloaked in hot flames, surging with a vigorous and scorching hot True Qi.Watching the punch come towards him, Chen Xiang immediately moved to dodge. But in that instant, his whole body suddenly became slax, and he was unable to put forth even a tiny bit of strength. He was even unable to move his True Qi which made his heart jump with shock.Yao Chong\u2019s face suddenly turned ferocious as he said in a heavy voice, \u201cChen Xiang, you are finished.\u201d Both of his flaming fists landed on Chen Xiang\u2019s body, madly striking him. In just a blink of an eye, his chest and head have all been smashed by those violent fists.\u201cThis b.a.s.t.a.r.d, he\u2019s actually at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!\u201d Chen Xiang had not expected that Yao Chong had hidden his strength so deeply. Yet what Chen Xiang was most angry about was the despicable trick that Yao Chong has used that resulted in Chen Xiang\u2019s body turning weak and made him unable to mobilize his True Qi.Unfortunately, Chen Xiang\u2019s body could be considered tougher than stone. Despite being struck by a 7th Mortal Martial Realm expert with no defense, he was still not seriously injured which scared the living daylights out of Yao Chong.\u201cWhen you were talking to me, you released an odorless and colorless poison from you mouth, paralyzing my meridians so that I can\u2019t move my True Qi right?\u201d Chen Xiang whispered, as his clear and calm eyes looked straight at Yao Chong.Yao Chong did not expect for his opponent to find out what method used so soon, but did not confirm or deny Chen Xiang\u2019s statement, instead he attempted to strike him with even more ferocity and madness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - b.l.o.o.d.y MethodsFrom the start of the match, Chen Xiang fell under the wind. It was out of everyone's expectations that Yao Chong\u2019s true strength was at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm which surprised all of them. Now they all understood why the Yao Family had matched up Yao Chong against Chen Xiang.\u201cChen Xiang, are you only this strong? I\u2019m very disappointed!\u201d Leng Youlan stood nearby hugging her bosom, her cold eyes filled with disappointment. At this time, Chen Xiang was already pushed to the edge of the stage and was going to be hit again by Yao Chong.The Yao Family\u2019s methods were very clever and even caught Chen Xiang off guard. The Yao Family considered nearly everything, but didn\u2019t know about the invisible ring on Chen Xiang\u2019s finger, or the two peerless beauties inside it. One of which, was a grand master of alchemy.\u201cThis is a strong poisonous gas that has a strong attribute of paralysis, but after the refinement of your body in the Immortal and Devil Pool, your meridians are extremely tough. You only need to operate the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and let the Tai Chi Diagram in your dantian rotate and the poisonous gas will be refined.\u201d Su Meiyao said.Operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] at once, the Spirit Qi all around Chen Xiang madly rushed into his body. Surging into the meridians along with the paralysis poisonous gas, they both flowed into his dantian and was refined by the five element True Qi inside.Yao Chong originally wanted to seriously wound Chen Xiang and then toss him off the stage, but no matter what Yao Chong did, Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes were filled with a deadly killing intent. Nothing close to resembling humanity could be seen in his eyes.Chen Xiang was already able to move. Meanwhile, without knowing this, the crowd was watching as Yao Chong pulled out a short knife that was shrouded in a cold aura, heading straight for Chen Xiang\u2019s chest![TLN: The actual translation for the short knife was Snickersnee, which looked like this]\u201cGo die!\u201d Yao Chong shouted.Everyone was shocked as the whole field bursted into commotion. One could hear curses being shouted one after another.Just as Yao Chong\u2019s short knife was about to pierce his opponents chest, Chen Xiang, who had not moved until now, suddenly stirred. Every single bone in Chen Xiang\u2019s body was ringing, emitting a \u201ccrackling\u201d sound. He stretched out his left hand and grabbed the edge of the short knife between his two fingers. Then viciously pinched the weapon turning it into small shards.\u201cb.a.s.t.a.r.d! First you paralyze me with underhanded poisonous gas, and now you want to kill me so desperately. You Yao Family sc.u.m are ruthless!\u201d Chen Xiang cursed extremely angrily. Violent azure aura surged into both of his hands, filling to the brim with a lighting aura True Qi, which was extremely scary.\u201c GO DIE!\u201d Chen Xiang shouted angrily as both of his fists shot forward like two violent storms, striking directly on Yao Chong\u2019s body. In just a blink of an eye, a rain of fists containing violent lighting Qi pounded Yao Chong\u2019s body.Yao Chong could only emit a series of pitiful screams as the Yao Family members in the audiences quickly leapt towards the stage. After seeing this, Chen Xiang\u2019s palm suddenly transformed into a huge Azure Dragon Claw. Azure True Qi was valiantly soaring from the dragon claw and swiftly pierced through Yao Chong body as blood soon sprayed out like a neverending fountain.The instant Yao Chong was. .h.i.t by the Azure Dragon Claw, True Qi easily pierced into his fragile body and left five gaping holes. He fell like a rag doll onto the ground but was still not dead yet.\u201cChen Xiang stop!\u201d A Yao Family Elder blasted a fist towards Chen Xiang, who easily side stepped it. A sudden burst of True Qi flas.h.i.+ng with lightning aura could be seen on Chen Xiang\u2019s legs. Fiercely lifting his leg up, he spun like he was wielding a giant axe wrapped in azure lighting and sent a devastating chop towards Yao Chong\u2019s waist.\u201cStop----\u201d That Yao Family Elder roared again, but Yao Chong had already been split in two by Chen Xiang\u2019s violent spinning kick. Yao Chong died instantly on the stage, the sight was extremely b.l.o.o.d.y and disgusting, while everyone watching suddenly had s.h.i.+vers running down their spines.The whole wide field was dead silent, the only noise that could be heard was a large group of people gulping. Chen Xiang\u2019s action made everyone astonished. Someone had actually, right in front of the Yao Family Gate, in front of an Yao Family Elder, beheaded one of the Yao Family\u2019s esteemed juniors. Not only that, but he had also done so in such a b.l.o.o.d.y and gruesome fas.h.i.+on.\u201cWhen he was trying to kill me, why didn\u2019t you try to stop him? If he tries to kill me, what in the world made you think I wouldn\u2019t kill him? Moreover, I still followed the rules imposed.\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s voice was freezing yet fully of fiery anger. If he wasn\u2019t able to disperse the poisonous gas in time, he would have been killed.Just a moment ago, Yao Chong tried to stab Chen Xiang with a short knife. Everybody saw this clear violation of the rules. As such, Chen Xiang violating the rule of no killing did not mean anything.\u201cDo you want to fight me?\u201d Chen Xiang looked coldly at that Yao Family Elder as Slaughter Qi soared out from his whole body.The Yao Family Elder saw the split in half body lying on the ground, still dripping with blood. His old face was full of anger, with a gaze that was also filled with killing intent. At this time, several other Yao Family Elders arrived.\u201cHa Ha Ha\u2026.. So funny, The Yao Family Brat decided to go against the rules to try and kill someone, but still couldn\u2019t do anything. Instead he was butchered and now, you old Yao Family men are looking for revenge?\u201d One extremely bold individual stood up and suddenly started laughing loudly and openly mocking the Yao Family.It was extremely loud and open. The ridicule from an audience member made those Yao Family Elders complexions extremely ugly. They really hated Chen Xiang so they had arranged Yao Chong to fight against Chen Xiang. They allowed Yao Chong to take the antidote before he filled his mouth with the poisonous gas, and they Yao Chong spoke with Chen Xiang. This way, Chen Xian was poisoned.But despite all this, the Yao Family underestimated Chen Xiang\u2019s strength. Yao Chong wasn\u2019t able to seriously injure Chen Xiang, but Yao Chong did not want to waste this golden opportunity. So he took out a short knife and tried to stab Chen Xiang. In Yao Chong\u2019s opinion, the Yao Family was extremely powerful in the Southern Martial Empire and would be able to easily sweep this matter under the rug, additionally, he would have killed Chen Xiang.\u201cChen Xiang. We, the Yao Family, will not let you off!\u201d One Elder vengefully stated, his voice full of resentment.Chen Xiang sneered at him and said \u201cThe dignified Yao Family has actually declined to such a point. Don\u2019t worry, I will not let off your Yao Family either.Chen Xiang walked down the tournament stage. The Yao Family Elder didn\u2019t dare resort to violence because if he did so, the Yao Family would be ridiculed in the entire Southern Martial Empire. Although this King City Martial Art Tournament was managed by the Yao Family, they still had to follow the rules. Yao Chong had violated the rules first, so Chen Xiang killing Yao Chong is a matter of course, even if the rules had stated against it.The Yao Family wanted to stop Chen Xiang from leaving. They were reluctant to give way, but they all had a really good understanding of Yao Chong\u2019s strength. If Chen Xiang had easily executed Yao Chong in such a way, it was certain that Chen Xiang was, at the very least, encroaching the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm strength!\u201cChen Xiang, don\u2019t be so proud. Yao Chong\u2019s teacher will soon come and deal with you.\u201d One of the Elders coldly snorted before giving way and sending orders to clean up the tournament stage.Both of the partic.i.p.ants were thought to be at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Yet Yao Chong was so vulnerable in front of Chen Xiang. Beforehand, Yao Chong had madly attacked Chen Xiang with all his might, yet failed to cause any harm to Chen Xiang. It was visible to anyone that Chen Xiang\u2019s strength was extraordinary. He was definitely not an ordinary martial artist in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Leng Youlan\u2019s beautiful curved eyebrows slightly knitted together. Watching Chen Xiang\u2019s back, she nibbled on her rosy red lips. She was also in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, but the True Qi she could cast out wasn\u2019t nearly as tough as Chen Xiang\u2019s. In both making True Qi erupt instantly or transforming it into a Qi Aura attack, it was extremely difficult to achieve it in such a arbitrary way. Even she could just barely do so.The grudge and hatred between Chen Xiang and the Yao Family deepened again. Moreover, this time, the other major forces were also tangled in it. This was because the relations.h.i.+p between them and the Yao Family was very good. Now that the war between the two were inevitable, they were unsettled. This was because if the Yao Family lost the battle, then the Chen Family would have annexed the Yao Family, firmly grasping all of their properties. Plus, the Chen Family was now also one of the strongest dan forces. If these families helped the Yao Family, they would only suffer a loss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Beauty DepartsChen Xiang returned to Dan King Hall, he instantly ran to practice within his private room. This time, Su Meiyao was going to teach him some underhanded methods to prevent poisoning. Otherwise, if he encountered a situation like this again, he may not be as lucky as he was today.\u201cLittle devil, you should have enraged that old man today and made him come out and fight you. Now you\u2019ve allowed him to prepare, you\u2019re too tender.\u201d Bai Youyou said. She was wearing a black dress, both hands hugging her chest as she leaned on the wall. Her clear as ice eyes displayed an unrestrained killing intent.Su Meiyao gently laughed and said \u201cSenior sister, I remember that you once said how you are very satisfied with how this brat handles things. What changed\u2026?\u201dBai Youyou snorts \u201cHumph. He doesn\u2019t have enough hatred. Not decisive enough regarding killing.\u201d\u201cSister Youyou, are you not tired of always wearing the same clothes? How about I buy you some newer and prettier outfits.\u201d Chen Xiang laughed and said. In order to please both beauties, Chen Xiang simply resorted to the best method he knew. That was to suggest beautiful clothes as woman liked this the most. Regarding this method, he has received rather good results from it.Bai Youyou\u2019s elegant face turned slightly crimson and her tone also became somewhat gentler. \u201cFor now, that is not required.\u201dSu Meiyao covered her mouth with her soft hands and started laughing. She pouted her small lips and complained \u201cYou little brat, what kind of potion did my senior sister fed you? She has more clothes than me, and I\u2019ve always been so good to you as well. Yet my things are so few, you are completely biased.\u201d Chen Xiang stuck his tongue out, taking a deep breath to inhale the delicate fragrance released from Su Meiyao\u2019s body. He deliberately made a bitter face and said \u201cIf I don\u2019t do this, how else can I make Sister Bai Youyou feel superior?\u201d\u201cHumph, becoming a little more clever are we?\u201d Bai Youyou snorts and says.\u201cSenior sister, since you\u2019re unwilling, why not give these clothes to me!\u201d Su Meiyao teasingly said.\u201cYou\u2019re actually asking me to give them to you? We usually share our clothes with each other.\u201d Bai Youyou gave her a contemptuous look.Chen Xiang knew that both beauties resided all day within a small house inside the ring. No doubt, they were bored so he often ordered a lot of beautiful clothes and got small things for them so they don\u2019t feel too down. He did all of this so that the two beauties would feel happy. Although they were once peerless experts, they had now lost all their strength and were just ordinary girls.Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao both knew how to deal with colorless and odorless poisonous gases. They soon taught Chen Xiang what they knew, it was mainly the method of how to guard his meridians using True Qi. After leaving the private room, Chen Xiang came to arbor in the backyard. Meng Bo and Chen Luzhong were also here, both discussing alchemy techniques. Chen Xiang joined in on their conversation and all three proceeded to exchange their experiences, which benefited all of them.\u201cBrat, today you\u2019ve once again stirred up trouble! At such a young age, it\u2019s already hard to understand you. How come you have such a knack for trouble?\u201d Chen Luzhong shook his head and laughed.Meng Bo laughed brightly, said, \u201cThis brat is truly not ordinary. Otherwise how could I have been defeated by him? It seems like a war between your Chen Family and the Yao Family is inevitable.\u201dChen Xiang skimmed his lips and replied, \u201cThe Yao Family asked for it, I think I simply did the right thing.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Chen, Manager, Senior Dan King, I did not think you were all together!\u201d A tender, sweet and soft voice drifted over as Chen Xiang\u2019s heart jumped up. This was definitely Hua Yueyun's voice. About the matter between Chen Xiang and Hua Yueyun, these two old men had guessed a few things. Otherwise, how come the Dangxiang Herbal Manor was willing to sell spirit herbs to the Dan King Hall at such a cheap price.The two old men silently left on their own as Chen Xiang\u2019s heart turned bitter.Hua Yueyun\u2019s dress was very tight today. Her beautiful jade like body was wrapped in a long white skirt. She looked like a fairy that enchanted people\u2019s mind with elegance. She had a unique flavor. Looking at her, Chen Xiang could not help but secretly praise her again and again, but at the same time he looked somewhat distressed.Seeing Chen Xiang looking depressed, Hua Yueyun angrily said, \u201cI know you hate me.\u201dChen Xiang hurriedly explained, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that Elder Sister Yueyun, you are too....tempting, that it could almost be considered a crime!\u201dHua Yueyun suddenly became happy, as she tenderly laughed and said \u201cAre you worried about me? Relax, as long as you enter the Danxiang Taoyuan, and become an excellent alchemist, I\u2019m yours.\u201dChen Xiang shook his head and said, \u201c No. I have already said that I want to enter the Extreme Martial Sect.\u201dHua Yueyun snorts softly and said, \u201cLittle sweetheart, are you thinking about other people now?\u201dChen Xiang quickly replied \u201cDid not, I did not. Yueyun sister you\u2019re really pretty, but as you know, I\u2019m engaged to Xianxian. So if I want to have concubines, I need to get her approval as well.\u201dHua Yueyun softly sighed, then stuck her tongue out towards Chen Xiang. Making fun of him, she said \u201cI do not want to be your mistress, I want to be your maidservant.\u201d\u201cRight, I\u2019m going back to the Danxiang Taoyuan today. Why don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d Hua Yueyun asked, her face was full of antic.i.p.ation.Chen Xiang was surprised and replied, \u201cDanxiang Taoyuan? I\u2019ve already decided to go the Extreme Martial Sect. Thanks for your consideration, but I\u2019ll have to decline.\u201d\u201cDo not be surprised, but each Manor lord is called Hua Yueyun, I\u2019ve managed the Danxiang Herbal Manor for two years. Now I must go back, I must tell you that my real name is not Hua Yueyun!\u201d Hua Yueyun said, her complexion immediately became one full of disappointment, now that she had to walk away from Chen Xiang.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but if I have the opportunity, I\u2019ll go to the Danxiang Taoyuan and find you.\u201d Chen Xiang sighed.Hua Yueyun said with a perfect smile, \u201cDo not worry about the Danxiang Herbal Manor selling herbs to the Dan King Hall. Even after I\u2019m gone, the Danxiang Herbal Manor will keep cooperating with the Dan King Hall, and the prices will also not increase.\u201dChen Xiang was confused about why this girl wanted to be his maidservant, nonetheless he was extremely grateful to her, \u201cThank you. You do not need to be my maidservant, we\u2019re friends! In the future, I\u2019ll go to the Danxiang Taoyuan and look for you.\u201dHua Yueyun laughed, said, \u201cYou do not want me as your girl, you\u2019ll certainly regret it later! Remember, you must come to the Danxiang Taoyuan and find me. For now I won't tell you my name, I don\u2019t want you finding me so easily after all!\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, she quickly went over to Chen Xiang and kissed him. Then ran away laughing, leaving Chen Xiang petrified like a stone statue.\u201cWhat... What\u2019s the matter with this woman?\u201d Chen Xiang licked his lips that still had some remaining fragrance, making him feel inexplicably wonderful.Su Meiyao laughed softly and said, \u201cThis little Yaojing decided to eat you, I\u2019m still not clear how you are so fortunate. Before it was Xue Xianxian, and now this Yaojing has taken a liking to you.\u201dChen Xiang snorts and said in a low voice and in a very c.o.c.ky way, \u201cHumph, That\u2019s because of my charm! You will understand why in the future!\u201dThese days, although Chen Xiang wasn\u2019t refining pills, he had been acc.u.mulating Dragon Saliva for growing herbs. He also started preparations for refining High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, and Low-Grade Spirit Level Dans. This was a new challenge for him, now that his strength was at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.The very next morning, Chen Xiang arrived at the entrance of the Yao Family field. Today was the match between Leng Youlan and Song Nanming. One was the Crown Prince, while the other was the daughter of a great general. Both of their strength were at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, this sort of things made others very much look forward to their match.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Vicious Hidden WeaponOn one side, above the tournament stage, a handsome man wearing a golden huafu stood. While on the other side, a mature girl wearing black tights that sketched out her charming and hot figure. Although she was only a young girl, she was already peerless beauty and had remarkable grace. Furthermore, she had beautiful yet bizarre white hairs, nonetheless she was very attractive.As Chen Xiang watched, he fell into disbelief. In the eyes of the Crown Prince, Song Nanming, pure unhidden resentment could be seen. Chen Xiang was sure that there must be some deep grudge between the two.\u201cHave you heard? This Crown Prince once proposed to Leng Youlan but she actually refused. Furthermore the Crown Prince then tried to take liberties with her and was slapped as a result\u201d A man said.\u201cI also heard that Leng Youlan kicked him in between his legs, wasting him. Later, he had to spend a large amount of spirit coins to buy an extremely good spirit herb.\u201d Laughed a middle-aged man.\u201cHahaha, this is definitely going to be fun to watch.\u201dChen Xiang didn\u2019t expect Leng Youlan had such courage to deal with Song Naming in such a peculiar way. As the contest started, Leng Youlan once again transformed into a black shadow, treading above the stage. After all, this excellent Qing Gong was her speciality. She was moving in hyper speed above the tournament stage, from time to time sending a slap or a kick towards Song Naming. Each time he either dodged or parried her attack.Song Nanming\u2019s strength was also quite good, but still it was a bit lacking compared to Leng Youlan\u2019s. After all, she had the Fire and Ice Dual Vein, and was able to fuse fire True Qi together with ice, resulting in a powerful and strange fusion of True Qi.Although Song Nanming was able to parry her attacks, the True Qi had a considerable effect on him, making his body feel as if it was sometimes hot and others cold. Additionally, he wasn\u2019t able to hit Leng Youlan because she was moving too quickly.\u201cCertainly Leng Youlan doesn\u2019t just have good martial skills, she only has this Qing Gong for high-speed movement.\u201d Su Mei Yao said. \u201cBecause of her fire and ice True Qi, only a few martial skills are suitable for her. As such, she can only battle this way. In the end, she doesn\u2019t get hit by any attack, not even allowing an opportunity for the opponent to touch her. This girl is fairly clever.\u201dWhat Chen Xiang cultivated was a multiple type True Qi, and was also able to direct single or multiple attributes of True Qi at the same time. However Leng Youlan couldn\u2019t, she could only use the fusion of fire and ice True Qi. Only a few martial art skills utilize both Qis at the same time, this was very troubling for Leng Youlan. Although her True Qi was terrifying, she lacked a truly suitable martial skill to demonstrate her full power.Song Nanming was still unable to hit Leng Youlan and could not help but grow irritated. He knew that if things were to continue unchanged, he would definitely lose.At this moment, Chen Xiang saw faint flashes of light suddenly flicker above the contest stage. His eyesight was extremely good, he could even see the ant\u2019s leg on the tournament stage. What he saw was a few nearly transparent needles that were protruding from Song Naming\u2019s sleeves.\u201cIce Needles!\u201dChen Xiang silently cursed at Song Naming. Soon, he heard Leng Youlan\u2019s cold and beautiful shout. He saw that she was suddenly covering her abdomen, staring at Song Naming with a face full of anger.Song Nanming only grinned in response and in a single step, arrived in front of Leng Youlan. Emitting True Qi from his legs, he fiercely kicked Leng Youlan\u2019s covered abdomen. The violent and powerful kick struck firmly on her body.Leng Youlan screamed as she flew off the tournament stage, to everyone\u2019s surprise she managed to steadily stop herself. But her hands covering her abdomen were soaked with blood.\u201cYou\u2026 You despicable fellow!\u201d Leng Youlan bit her lips, her eyes were filled with resentment and hate towards Song Nanming who was still on the tournament stage.\u201cYou are merely incompetent, yet you dare call me despicable?\u201d Song Nanming sneered.Leng Youlan removed her palm, her abdomen was still bleeding but there was nothing to see, she could only feel a trace of coldness. She quickly guessed it was due to an ice needle, but it had already melted.Chen Xiang arrived beside her as he took out some herbal powder and a Dispelling Poison Dan. Speaking in a serious tone he said \u201cBe careful, Ice Needles are often poisonous.\u201dLeng Youlan looked at the objects in Chen Xiang hands and could not help but be surprised. She nibbled her lips and whispered: \u201cThank You!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make him pay for what he did to you.\u201d Chen Xiang slightly smiled towards her.Leng Youlan sighed and said \u201cMy hopes for entering a martial sect is now shattered. Many thanks Young Master Chen for giving me these dans.\u201dChen Xiang understood that in order to learn appropriate martial skills, Leng Youlan had to enter a sect and search, but now she had lost that opportunity.\u201cBrat, give her the Metal Spirit Fruit and make her go to the Extreme Martial Sect. She has the rare Ice and Fire Dual Vein, the Extreme Martial Sect will eagerly accept her.\u201d Su Mei Yao said.Chen Xiang was surprised to hear this while looking at Leng Youlan\u2019s slightly angry face.\u201cTell her that if the Extreme Martial Sect does not accept her, she could give the Metal Spirit Fruit in exchange for an a.s.sessment.\u201d This time it was Bai Youyou\u2019s voice. They were all girls and Leng Youlan is a good seedling, they would naturally want her to have good achievements in the future.Chen Xiang whispered \u201cMiss Leng, this poison contained within the Ice Needles may be serious. Could you accompany me to the Dan King Hall for further examination?\u201dSong Nanming, who was on the tournament stage, he grounded his teeth as he watched Chen Xiang and Leng Youlan interact . Song Nanming could not hear what Chen Xiang said, but he hated the fact that the two were talking to each other.Chen Xiang and Leng Youlan acted fairly nice towards each other. One is a prestigious and talented teenager while the other was a 7th level Mortal Martial Realm beauty, mutual admiration was a normal thing to occur.Leng Youlan nodded her head and left with Chen Xiang. She was also worried about the poison in the Ice Needles as she could possibly die from it.On the third floor of the Dan King Hall, Meng Bo\u2019s face was full of anger declaring \u201cVery good ruthless poison. This thing could remain hidden in someone\u2019s body for a very long time. The majority of this poison could even remain inside an individual for several months, possibly even after a year!\u201d\u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t worry too much. Although this position is formidable, once it\u2019s found it\u2019s actually quite simple to remove.\u201d Meng Bo chuckled and pulled out a dan. \u201cThis is a High-Grade Mortal Level Dan, the Cleansing Core Dan, it can easily detoxify this poison.\u201dWhen Leng Youlan found out that Song Nanming had used such deceitful and devious means to deal with her after the compet.i.tion, her face was full of hatred.She looked at the dan in Meng Bo\u2019s hand and asked in a low voice \u201cHow many spirit coins?\u201d\u201cJust eat it, there is no need to pay.\u201d Chen Xiang then took the dan and handed it to her.Meng Bo chuckled as he left on his own cognisance.Leng Youlan had a complex expression that could be seen in her eyes as she looked at Chen Xiang. \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d Although she had brought up the matter, she guessed that Chen Xiang might have been attracted to her beautiful face. But she also knew that Chen Xiang had a fiancee, one who was currently away in one of those martial sects. A very talented and beautiful girl.Chen Xiang laughed and said, \u201cNo big reason, I just wanted to become friends.\u201dLeng Youlan swallowed the dan and then smiled towards Chen Xiang, it was similar to a peony flower blossoming. Chen Xiang could not help but stare at her.\u201cI never thought that I would become friends with you, a genius alchemist. It\u2019s my pleasure to be friends with you.\u201d Leng Youlan\u2019s complexion became much better as she softly said \u201cMany thanks Young Master Chen.\u201dChen Xiang shook his head in response and said \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Here, this is a Metal Spirit Fruit, keep it.Although Leng Youlan was not proficient in herbs, even she had heard about the Metal Spirit Fruit. She also knew that it was this fruit that the Dan King Hall had used to recruit alchemists, but had not expected Chen Xiang to give one to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: SisterEdited By: Sietse\u201cDon\u2019t ask me why. Just take it and go to the Extreme Martial Sect. If they don\u2019t let you join, give them the Metal Spirit Fruit in exchange for an a.s.sessment. Through this method, you can enter into the sect, as I believe that you hold all the qualifications needed to pa.s.s their examination.\u201d Chen Xiang instructed.Leng Youlan was shocked, for her, it was very hard to believe that Chen Xiang would help her in such a way.\u201cYoulan, your father, Great General Leng, was killed in battle a few years ago. It was you who has had it hard these past few years. How about we become sworn brother and sister? After I also enter the Extreme Martial Sect, I will take care of you!\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s heart was moved when he remembered Leng Youlan\u2019s life experience. Watching her, anyone would feel pity and compa.s.sion towards her, as they couldn\u2019t help but have such feelings.Leng Youlan also became startled. She nibbled her lips as her eyes suddenly became moist. Yet, she faced Chen Xiang, smiled and said: \u201cLittle sister greets elder brother!\u201dChen Xiang grinned: \u201cYoulan, you have the Fire and Ice Veins, after you enter the Martial Art Sect, your future prospects are boundless! I\u2019ll help you in any way I can.\u201dBefore, Leng Youlan was a little wary about Chen Xiang, but any of her suspicions and other thoughts had vanished in a puff of smoke. She now knew that, with Chen Xiang\u2019s current status, he could get any girl he wished for. It would be very idiotic of him to tarnish his reputation just because of a matter between a man and a woman.Although Chen Xiang and Leng Youlan had just recently met, they were concerned about each other, almost as if they had known each other for a long time! And Today, they had met and recognized each other as equals!Chen Xiang was helping her, and essentially showering her with love. She was extremely moved, as this was the first time that someone had shown such care for her after her father\u2019s death. They had only met each other for the first time, yet she had already received so much help. Therefore, Leng Youlan was very happy to become Chen Xiang\u2019s sister. From the moment she had heard about him, she was impressed by Chen Xiang\u2019s strength, almost to the point of secretly wors.h.i.+pping him!\u201cBrother, I\u2019ll always remember your kindness today! I\u2019ll be on my way, my body situation is slightly complicated at the moment. I don\u2019t want to delay any longer, remember to teach that ruthless Song Nanming a lesson he won\u2019t forget.\u201d Leng Youlan said, as she smiled at Chen Xiang.\u201cYoulan, hold on. Be sure to be careful on the way!\u201d Chen Xiang then pa.s.sed her a small jade bottle. Inside of it were several very good pills, solidifying Leng Youlan\u2019s feelings of grat.i.tude.Leng Youlan\u2019s father was killed three years ago in battle. For all these years she had been living alone. It was very difficult for her, however, trying to elevate her strength alone showed that she was a very strong girl.Leng Youlan\u2019s eyes once again moistened up, she nodded and said, \u201cPlease accept Youlan\u2019s salute.\u201dChen Xiang immediately went to hug her, laughingly saying \u201cMy dear sister, I forbid you to do such things! Be careful on your way to the Martial Sect!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll become a lot stronger. Brother, you must remember to look for me!\u201d Leng Youlan wiped her tears away, as the feelings of receiving somebody\u2019s love and concern had made her feel very moved once again.\u201cEn, I\u2019ll certainly come!\u201d Chen Xiang stroked her silky white hair.\u201cBrother, what if I don\u2019t go just yet? I know there is some hatred between you and the Yao Family. Perhaps I can be of help!\u201d Leng Youlan restored her previous cold and proud demeanor, her whole body full of vigor. With her war-like intentions soaring, she resembled a valkyrie. But watching Chen Xiang, her expression was soft.Chen Xiang shook his head, smiled and said: \u201cNo, my Chen Family can easily deal with it. Your health is more important.\u201dLeng Youlan bit her lips, firmly saying: \u201cBrother, later I\u2019ll fight side by side with you. I won\u2019t drag you down!\u201dChen Xiang was very pleased with her reply, he nodded his head and asked: \u201cYou know the way?\u201d\u201cI know. I have been gathering information about all of the sects long ago. Although the route is somewhat dangerous, I can handle it, there is no need for you to worry.\u201d Leng Youlan said.Chen Xiang accompanied Leng Youlan out of the city. Here, he sat down and watched, as she rode away on a horse...In the afternoon, it was Chen Xiang\u2019s turn to compete. But when he went to the tournament stage, he was told his compet.i.tor had abstained, which made him feel somewhat weird.After the display of Chen Xiang\u2019s strength, in addition to the b.l.o.o.d.y display he had made yesterday when he had killed Yao Chong, everyone was afraid of Chen Xiang\u2019s strength and the fear was still lingering in their minds.In the finals, Chen Xiang was going to be facing the Crown Prince, Song Nanming. The audience was extremely looking forwards towards this match. For many people, the Crown Prince\u2019s strength was unfathomable, because of how he had defeated Leng Youlan. Additionally, he was, after all, the Crown Prince of the Southern Martial Empire, as such, he had a gigantic number of resources and could learn various powerful martial skills.But Chen Xiang knew that Song Nanming\u2019s strength was inferior to Leng Youlan, it was only because of his dirty tricks that he had won. Chen Xiang had already decided, that as long as the Crown Prince used Ice Needles against him, he would act mercilessly.The Dan King Hall had already been opened for a few days. It was also very popular, stealing away a lot of the Yao Family\u2019s business. Chen Xiang was concerned about the Chen Family Elder, Chen Furong. He hadn\u2019t taken any action yet, even though Chen Xiang had just killed one of the important Yao Family\u2019s Juniors yesterday. Taking into account Chen Furong\u2019s previous actions, he should be looking to cause trouble for the Dan King Hall. Chen Xiang was sure he was up to no good. He also received a message from his father, that the majority of the Chen Family\u2019s experts were on their way to the King City, furthermore they were coming secretly.Late at night, Chen Xiang was cultivating in a private room, when he suddenly sensed the breathing of several people at the 8th level of the mortal martial realms appearing inside the Dan King Hall. He was awakened by this and quickly left his private room, heading towards the source of the breaths.\u201cDad!\u201d Chen Xiang was surprised as he looked at the other people present. In the group, there were two middle aged men, the other three being rather old.\u201cUncle Yihan, Great Uncle Haohai, Great Elder, 2nd Elder, and 3rd Elder!\u201d Chen Xiang was shocked in his heart, as he quickly saluted these elders. Excluding Chen Haohai, Elder Chen Yihan, the other three were at the 7th level of the mortal martial realm. Yet now, they had already entered the 8th level of the mortal martial realm.[TLN: I don\u2019t know about other, but in my translation great elder, great uncle, great brother as such means eldest brother, uncle and such.]\u201cSmelly brat! You certainly put my [Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Gra.s.s] to good use!\u201d Chen Haohai laughed merrily. He was quite sorrowful on the day that he had lost that herb. But now, when he saw that the Dan King Hall had flourished to such a degree, he felt surprised and delighted.Chen Yihan smiled, his smile was somewhat gentle while at same time somewhat sinister, as he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you could establish a dan shop in such a short amount of time. Moreover, drawing in the Dan King, our Chen family will certainly be able to become one of the strongest families in the Southern Martial Empire.\u201dThe other three elders also praised him abundantly.One bald old-man said: \u201cThe Yao Family was greatly resisting and blocking our Chen Family\u2019s entry into King City, among them was Chen Furong!\u201d\u201cGreat Elder is correct, fortunately for us, we made contact with an ancestor of our Chen family. He helped us breakthrough to the 8th level of the mortal martial realm using spirit level dans! He cannot meddle in secular worldly matters, so he let us clean out the house and handle Chen Furong\u2026\u201d The 2nd Elder made a killing gesture.Chen Xiang frowned, asking: \u201cHow strong is Chen Furong? How many Chen family members have come?\u201dChen Tianhu answered: \u201cWe brought three hundred elite disciples, who are all above the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, while we few old men also came to help.\u201dChen Tianhua was also at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and now there are six Chen Family Martial Artists who were at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, counting in Chen Xiang that number was raised to seven! According to the structures of power in the Southern Martial Empire, their strength was quite astonis.h.i.+ng.\u201cChen Furong is estimated to be at the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Thus, six of us together may just barely be able to balance it out.\u201d The Great Elder said with a somewhat serious expression.Chen Xiang smiled slightly: \u201cIf our Chen Family and the Yao Family go to war, you just have to handle the Yao Family, leave Chen Furong to me!\u201dChen Tianhu suddenly stood there blankly, as the jaws of the three elders were almost touching the ground.\u201cMy dear son\u2026 Have you entered the 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm?\u201d Chen Tianhu asked, he was astonished and it was clearly visible on his face.Chen Xiang slightly pursed his lips, saying: \u201cI\u2019m just at the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, but I think I\u2019ll be able to hold Chen Furong for quite a while. That way, you elders, with your overwhelming strength, will be able to completely decimate the Yao Family.Chen Tianhu let loose a long breath, if Chen Xiang had entered into the 9th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm at his age, then he himself, as well as the other old men, should just go die in a hand full of water. Thankfully, Chen Xiang had only entered into the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, which still gave them a big surprise! They also knew that his strength couldn\u2019t be defined by common norms. After all, when Chen Xiang was merely in the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he was already able to defeat Chen Yihan, who was in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm! Remembering this fact, the Chen Family Experts all shuddered.Chen Tianhu and the others soon left, they still had to secretly lead the three hundred elites to the Yao Family\u2019s tournament field tomorrow. Meanwhile, Chen Xiang was still adjusting himself to get to his most optimum state, so that he was prepared to cope with various situations that could occur tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Dragon Martial TechniqueThe weather was sunny in the mornings, as usual King City was very lively. Many people learned that there was only the final round left of the King City Martial Art Tournament. However, even after that, there was one more hurdle to pa.s.s. One of the martial art sect\u2019s disciple was also going to compete. Only after winning against that disciple, could someone be considered the victor of the entire tournament.Hearing this new piece of information, Chen Xiang secretly cursed in his heart. He guessed that it must have been because of Chen Furong. He must have disappeared from King City to recruit someone for this specific purpose, just so that Chen Xiang could not be considered the true winner of the King City Martial Art Tournament.\u201cRest a.s.sured, it is impossible for an Inner Disciple to partic.i.p.ate, they don\u2019t have that much spare time. If I have to guess, it will probably be a relatively strong Outer Sect Disciple. Most likely it will be someone around the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm.\u201d Su Mei Yao said. She and Bai Youyou were very clear about the inner proceedings of sects.\u201cThat\u2019s good, I hope that they are not too disappointing.\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s fighting spirit soared in his heart.At the Yao Family\u2019s main entrance, tens of thousands of people had already gathered. This was the finals of the tournament, besides, it was the compet.i.tion between two young juniors, both of which very prestigious and strong young men.Among the crowd, Chen Tianhu, Chen Yihan, Chen Haohai and others had already hidden themselves. They each commanded fifty Chen Family Elite Juniors. As soon as there was any sign of trouble, they were ready to take action.As Chen Xiang came over to the middle of the tournament stage, the crowd suddenly burst into an uproar.\u201cSurprisingly, he actually dared to come! I heard that the Yao Family will take him away right after he wins the finals.\u201d One man said with a surprise.\u201cIt is said that he has something to do with the disappearance of the Yao Family Elder and their young genius! The Yao Family will probably pin that crime on him as an excuse to deal with him.\u201d Another middle-aged man said.\u201cHe already has so much courage at such young age. Two days before, he faced the Yao Family Elders after ma.s.sacring Yao Chong! Chen Xiang\u2019s strength is also good and he also dares to fearlessly threaten others regardless of their background.\u201d One teenager said full of envy.\u201cOf course, in this world, strength has always have been revered! As long you have strength, you can have everything!\u201d\u201c...\u201dListening to the arguments and conversations from the audience, Chen Xiang knew that the Yao Family had deliberately released some information. This gave off the message that they were prepared to deal with the Chen Family, which also signified the start of the war between the two families. This was a very common method, other forces would often release such information to warn and threaten their opponents.Not far away from the tournament stage, there was a tower. On the top of that tower, there were many luxuriously dressed people residing in a room. Many maids and guards were present around them, from this alone, one could tell that their status was definitely out of the ordinary.\u201cThe Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Emperor is also watching the finals. I heard he is here to boost the morale of his son, and that he has also bought many Imperial Palace Experts. In fact, even all of the Imperial Concubines have come here to watch the finals!\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s eyesight was very formidable. Among the people seated in the tower he could see a person wearing the dragon robe *. He had a majestic expression, that middle-aged man with the extraordinary bearing was no doubt the Emperor of the Southern Martial Empire.For the common populace, the Imperial Power was way above them. But for the powerful families, they were simply not worth mentioning. In the eyes of those families, the Emperor was just someone who manages the Empire, so that it can develop in an orderly fas.h.i.+on. There was not any kind of disarray among the populace, so these families could smoothly gain benefits from the common ma.s.ses.The Crown Prince arrived as he flew from that distant tower. He was wearing a fiery red and magnificent dress, displaying the elegant Qing Gong skill he had. Softly, he landed on the tournament stage, his arrival alone caused many girls present to scream out.Chen Xiang was secretly belittling him in his heart, thinking \u201cLook at you, seeming so imposing. Just wait, I will beat you so hard that even your father, the Emperor, will not recognize you afterwards.\u201dSong Nanming looked at Chen Xiang with disdain in his eyes, and calmly said, \u201cIf you want to relieve yourself from physical suffering, there is still some time.\u201dSong Nanming knew how strong Chen Xiang was, but Song Nanming was also very confident about his victory.Chen Xiang, looking at that arrogant and sinister face of Song Nanming, guessed that he definitely had another despicable trick up his sleeve. This time, Chen Xiang was cautious and ready, otherwise he would be on the back foot again.\u201cRest a.s.sured, I\u2019m very thick skinned. I\u2019m afraid your hand will hurt if you hit me.\u201d Chen Xiang replied, it sounded sarcastic, but what he said was the truth.\u201cHumph, you don\u2019t know the immensity of the heavens!\u201d Song Nanming coldly snorted. He intentionally raised his voice, making it so that everyone on the whole field could hear it.Seeing Song Nanming putting on a high and mighty act, Chen Xiang secretly smiled in his heart. If you don\u2019t have necessary strength, everything said and done was all completely useless.\u201cStart! If someone violates the rules, you can already figure out the consequences!\u201d One old-man wearing a gray robe shouted. He was not a member of the Yao Family but rather one of oldest martial artists. It is said that he was the descendant of the founder of the Martial Art Tournament.Song Nanming had already violated the rules before, but there was no evidence, so Chen Xiang could not do anything or point it out.At the start, Song Nanming faced the audience as he took off his golden red dress. Inside, he was wearing golden tights, and golden boots. It looked as if a wealthy n.o.bleman had appeared on stage.\u201cToday, I\u2019ll show you a bit of the martial skills from our Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Imperial Family. I\u2019ll let you experience the formidability of the [Dragon Martial Technique]!\u201d Shouted Song Nanming. An unusual fierce breath emanated from his body, it was similar to Chen Xiang\u2019s [Azure Dragon True Qi], but was lacking in it\u2019s ancient and majestic imposing aura.\u201c[Dragon Martial Technique]!\u201d This was one of the ancient martial techniques. Legend had it, the technique was handed down by someone who later transformed into a divine dragon. After casting it, one would gain the same imposing manner and power as a real dragon.That said legend was certainly formidable, however, to be as formidable as dragon was very hard to believe. Watching the visible golden essence flowing in the blue veins of Song Nanming\u2019s fists, everyone could not help but gasp! They had not expected that they would be able to witness the mystical [Dragon Martial Technique] in their lifetime.Chen Xiang narrowed his eyes, released his powerful and invisible divine sense. He enveloped Song Nanming\u2019s whole body, and could clearly see Song Nanming\u2019s internal organs and was also able to observe how his True Qi was circulating. Simultaneously, Chen Xiang secretly stored the whole process in his mind, and then also made his True Qi flow in accordance with the previous method.\u201cI did not expect the [Dragon Martial Technique] to appear in this secular world. Make sure to remember every bit of it.\u201d Su Mei Yao transmitted this order to Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang had already learned the entire technique. At this time, Song Nanming, because of the profound method of circulating his Qi, had made all of his internal True Qi change in order to produce a stronger and more powerful force.\u201c[Dragon Aura Fist]!\u201dSong Nanming fiercely leapt into the air. As if a golden aura was shot towards Chen Xiang. Song Nanming\u2019s fists quickly transformed which had an uncanny resemblance to the eagle claws. Constantly rumbling, one after another, Golden Qi Aura flew towards Chen Xiang. Sending shock waves in the air as they flew past, followed by burst of sonic booms one after another, as they violently struck on Chen Xiang\u2019s chest.After the Golden Qi Aura stuck Chen Xiang\u2019s chest, Song Nanming soon appeared in front of Chen Xiang. Both of their fists flew towards each other, as the two moved, only explosions followed them. Fist met fist at an extremely fast pace. From afar, it appeared as if both of them had thousands of arms. In the mere blink of an eye, a few hundred punches had already been exchanged. Each filled with True Qi resulting in numerous explosions.Song Nanming threw out Qi Aura with each fist, and also produced a Qi Explosion. As such, the huge tournament stage started shaking, while the frightening sonic booms made more and more people shudder.But what made everyone dumbfounded was not the fact that Song Nanming had casted the [Dragon Martial Technique], but rather the fact that Chen Xiang\u2019s fists had met evenly with Song Nanming\u2019s blows. Furthermore, the speed of Chen Xiang\u2019s fists were exactly the same as Song Nanming\u2019s punches. Additionally, all of this was done with a relaxed expression on Chen Xiang\u2019s face.[*TLN: Long Pao(\u9f99\u888d) or the Dragon robe are the gowns wore by the Emperor in China. It is just a robe with a dragon or many dragons on it. If you are interested how it looks you can check it out here. All of the robe shown there are Long Pao.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - t.i.t For TatThe crowd was unable to clearly see the quick blows from Song Nanming. Each of them was covered in a very powerful Qi Aura, but Chen Xiang was able to keep up his opponent's speed. In fact, it seemed as if he was precisely judging the end location of each blow, and then accurately retaliated with his own!Chen Xiang was using the [Azure Dragon True Qi], violent lightning was flas.h.i.+ng in between the two figures, rumbling as they moved from place to place. With each counter blow, a roar could be heard, each producing its own Qi Aura Storm. This was far more imposing and stronger than the so called [Dragon Aura Fist] from Song Nanming.The site above the tournament stage was a dazzling sight to behold, it was as if two people were responsible for a giant parade of fireworks! Except, instead of countless sparks, they were deadly explosions caused from the two\u2019s fists colliding against each other!It was Song Nanming who had first initiated the fight, but now he was gradually retreating, yet somehow he remained dignified. Both of his fists were now numb, he could sense Chen Xiang\u2019s vigorous True Qi from each counterattack. But it was more than that, Song Nanming had also thought that he would be able to quickly defeat Chen Xiang by casting the [Dragon Aura Fist] so Song Nanming had desperately consumed a vast amount of True Qi for the martial skill. Yet it just ended up being easily repulsed by Chen Xiang.\u201cThis lost ancient martial skill is not something the likes of you can use. You are simply unworthy of the [Dragon Martial Technique].\u201d Chen Xiang suddenly sneered as his blows became even more fierce. Suddenly he retreated a few steps as golden Qi started to emanate from his whole body.On both of his fists, golden True Qi was flowing inside his meridians, similar to what happened when Song Nanming used the [Dragon Martial Technique]. But compared to the previous scene, this one seemed much more formidable.The Golden Aura valiantly surged, reflecting even in Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes. His hands looked like they were covered in solid gold, vaguely giving off the illusion that they had turned into vigorous and powerful eagle claws! In fact, golden scales started appearing one by one, piece by piece. Their aura valiantly surged, combining and fusing with the Slaughter Qi which made it capable of shaking people\u2019s very soul.The [Dragon Martial Technique] was suitable for someone who used the Metal Attributed True Qi. Chen Xiang\u2019s Metal Attributed True Qi corresponded to the White Tiger. As his Metal Attributed True Qi carried killing intent, when he casted the [Dragon Martial Technique] his imposing manner not only combined with his threatening Slaughter Qi, but rather multiplied it\u2019s strength! His imposing aura was not only that of slaughter and fear, but also the aura of someone who disdained the entire world! Arrogant, conceited, ignoring all world powers and influences, he stood there alone!In that distance tower, the Emperor fiercely rose up from his throne. His eyes were wide open and a clear look of astonishment could be seen in them. Looking at Chen Xiang, the Emperor muttered, \u201cImpossible\u2026 IMPOSSIBLE! Only we of the imperial family posses the [The Dragon Martial Technique]. How in the world would a brat like him learn it!?\u201dSuddenly, pure raw murderous intent appeared on the Emperor's face. \u201cInside the entire Southern Martial Empire, we must never allow others to grasp the [Dragon Martial Technique]. Only we, of the imperial family, can be considered the true descendants of the dragon race!\u201dChen Xiang had never thought the [Dragon Martial Technique] was profound or hard to master. After all, he simply followed and recreated the exact same things he saw in Song Nanming when he had operated his True Qi for this technique. Albeit, it was a little bit complicated, but Chen Xiang had an extremely powerful and keen divine sense. He easily perfectly memorized it and branded it onto his mind. Now that he had finally cast his new skill, an amazingly powerful aura was emitted throughout his entire body.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026You\u2026...How could you? Where in the world did you learn this!? Only those of us who have the dragon blood inheritance are able to learn it! A mere mortal like you\u2026\u201dHis words weren't even completely finished before Chen Xiang took a step, which erupted into a loud explosion! In fact, even the tournament stage that had been made of thick wood was suddenly crushed, completely collapsing under the tyrannical might of this single step. Smoke and dust scattered in all directions, shocking the h.e.l.l out of everybody watching.This level of frightening power caused everyone close to the stage to retreat, they feared their lives would be in danger if they stayed too close.\u201cHmmm, although it consumes a lot of True Qi, it\u2019s power if equally great! Indeed, it is truly worthy of the t.i.tle of a lost ancient martial skill!\u201d Chen Xiang could not help but marvel at the strength he now possessed. He had not expected to learn this mighty martial skill, Chen Xiang had gotten a very large harvest!Song Nanming was shocked by this, but there was also hate and envy at how Chen Xiang could display the very same [Dragon Martial Technique], yet at such a more profound and powerful level. It also gave Song Nanming insight into the techniques frightening depths, yet he simply could not reach the same level of force as Chen Xiang.\u201cChen Xiang, do not blame me. Blame yourself for showing off your ability!\u201dSong Nanming\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed with a hint of a ferocious and ruthless aura. He fiercely waved his hand as ten very fine, and small needles penetrated the dense smoke of dust, flying straight towards Chen Xiang.Although smoke was flying around everywhere, Chen Xiang\u2019s divine sense was still extremely formidable. He was able to completely grasp all the movement of objects around him. Including those tiny needles that were currently flying straight at him.As the needles flew towards Chen Xiang, he shouted as a sudden wall of fire appeared in front of him. This was alchemical True Qi fire, which was capable of refining even the most heat resistant materials that were harder than iron! Those tiny needles never stood a chance.Those needles instantly melted when they struck that wall of fire. The fire wall also soon vanished, shortly after the smoke started to disperse as well. With that powerful and mighty Dragon Qi Aura surging in both his fists, Chen Xiang walked step by step towards Song Nanming.\u201cDragon Aura Fist!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly shouted. Both of his fists crazily smashed towards his opponent, it was as if thousands of golden meteors were raining down on Song Nanming.Song Nanming was still in daze due to the fact that Chen Xiang could evade even those tiny hidden needles. Song Nanming didn\u2019t even see it coming when those Dragon Aura Fists rained down him. In just the blink of an eye, his whole body had been struck hundreds of times by those hard golden fists. The sound of impact on his flesh was like a thunderbolt capable of shaking the heavens, yet also resembled fierce firecrackers that were successively bursting one after another.Song Nanming\u2019s whole body was attacked so fiercely and madly that every piece of his flesh, bones, and even meridians had ruptured and broken. His entire body looked liked it had been squeezed together into paste. He lay there on the ground, like a large piece of meat pie, somehow still alive. Technically, since he did not die, this brutal beating was not counted as a violation of the rules.However, Song Nanming could be considered to be among the living dead! From where does he resemble anything like human? There only remained a putty of rotten meat!Everyone in the field vomited, some people were even more frightened and were also shrieking while they were vomiting. That thing did not resemble the previous arrogant, handsome and terrifying Crown Prince even the slightest bit!\u201cYou asked for it!\u201d Chen Xiang thought that he was in the right and simply taught a very simple lesson to the arrogant Crown Prince. Originally, he simply wanted to defeat Song Nanming, but when he had attacked with those vicious needles, Chen Xiang erupted with fury and was unable to hold back his power as he exploded with eighty percent of his full strength.\u201cNanming!\u201d A roar came from the far off distance, yet it still shook the ears of the audience in the wide field. A very angry middle-aged man wearing Long Pao suddenly appeared at the side of Song Nanming, whose very condition of whether he was still alive or not was very hard to determine.This was the Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Emperor, Song Wu!Everyone present on the wide field were still in a daze from the previous incident. Chen Xiang had crippled the emperor\u2019s son, and emperor is in no way weak. Maybe a big battle would erupt soon.\u201cTake the Crown Prince back to the Imperial Palace!\u201d Song Wu shouted at the two people behind him. They were the Imperial Palace Experts, who had arrived right after Song Wu. They had previously come along with him to watch the tournament, moreover they were also very strong.Chen Xiang didn\u2019t violate any sort of rules, and as Song Nanming\u2019s father, he was also very well aware of the petty means Song Nanming used in the tournament. The Emperor guessed that Chen Xiang must have found out and was annoyed. In order prevent everyone here from discovering the petty tricks of Crown Prince, the Emperor made the others to take Song Nanming back to Imperial Palace, rather than sending him to the Yao Family.The Emperor\u2019s reputation was more important than anything else! If the general population came to learn about how the Crown Prince resorted to deceitful tricks, then the days of ruling over the Southern Martial Empire would soon come to an end. Furthermore, if this sort of thing was found out by the Yao Family, then they would use it as blackmail and threaten the Emperor into doing things he did not want to do.Chen Xiang soon saw through the hidden reason in Song Wu\u2019s act. Chen Xiang simply smiled and said, \u201cIndeed you are the monarch of a country. That decision you just made, to not keep your son in the Yao Family was brilliant! Soon you will realize that the action you just took gave you a big benefit and also saved you from a larger predicament.\u201dSong Wu coldly snorted, \u201cIt is normal to get injured while partic.i.p.ating in the Martial Art Tournament, but you were too heavy-handed! You better hope the Crown Prince is alright, otherwise\u2026\u201dAfter saying his threat, Song Wu quickly sped away. The Emperor had not taken into account that Chen Xiang was responsible for this incident. Everyone let out a deep breath, at the same time they admired Song Wu\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Skies Beyond SkiesChen Xiang walked towards the old man who was presiding over the tournament, and asked \u201cI am the winner of this tournament, now may I receive the rewards?\u201dThere was a perfectly visible expression of helplessness on the old man\u2019s face. He said \u201cI\u2019m just presiding over the tournament, the reward is not distributed by me. The True Elemental Dan is given out by the sects. You will get it once you pa.s.s through their a.s.sessment.\u201dA sliver of a smile flashed on Chen Xiang\u2019s face. Although it seemed very charming, that old man felt unbased fear and could not help but shudder. It seemed that just a moment earlier, an overwhelming Slaughter Qi had secretly burrowed deep into his body and soul, making him feel like death was nigh.Actually, just a moment ago, Chen Xiang was extremely angry and had inadvertently released frightening amount of Slaughter Qi. From the very start of this tournament, to it\u2019s current end, he knew that it was manipulated by others. Even the final winner would find it very difficult to get that True Elemental Dan.Chen Furong arrived, although he was one of the Chen Family Seniors, due to wanting to curry favor with the Yao Family members in the martial sect, he wanted to prevent the development of his own family, even resorted into attacking his own family patriarch!Previously, when Chen Furong wounded Chen Tianhu, the entire Chen Family, whether their position was high or low, no longer accepted Chen Furong as one of their own.Chen Furong was followed by a beautiful, delicate, and fair skinned man. He looked very elegant and bewitching, his whole body excluding a very pure True Qi. From this alone, one could tell that this martial artist\u2019s True Qi was astonis.h.i.+ngly vibrant and pure.\u201cChen Xiang\u2026 I did not think you would successfully open the Dan King Hall\u2026 Moreover, you also harmed my new apprentice\u2026\u201dYao Chong\u2019s master was actually Chen Furong!\u201cShut up, you traitor of the family! You are not part of our Chen Family, what I want to do is my own business and none of yours! Why would my dan shop have to get your, an old dog\u2019s, approval!? Who do you think you are!? You\u2019re just an old dog who has a speciality in licking other people\u2019s shoes.\u201d Chen Xiang loudly shouted, his voice vibrating throughout the whole field. Every single one of the hidden Chen Family Members heard it, and their hearts relaxed.\u201cYou...,YOU f.u.c.kING BRAT! YOU SEEK DEATH!\u201d Chen Furong had a very red face due to his anger, and wanted nothing more than to personally come out and fight Chen Xiang. But before he could do anything, he was stopped by the man behind him.\u201cLet me and this \u2018Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Strongest Teenager\u2019 exchange blows. I would like to see with what ability he want to take away the True Elemental Dan.\u201d That man coldly said. His complexion was filled with disdain, making one feel as if he thought he was the strongest in the entire world.Chen Xiang replied back with a curt and cold tone. \u201cYou both are part of sects and belong to their world. You are to only partic.i.p.ate in those matters, yet you violate your sect rules and regulations\u2026 especially this old fart.\u201d\u201cIf you win, this True Elemental Dan is yours. If you lose, you have to die.\u201d The man coldly said.\u201cWhy would I have to die if I lose?\u201d Chen Xiang sneered.\u201cBecause no one has ever lived after a martial art contest against me, Zhang Long.\u201d Zhang Long said with a proud look.Chen Xiang burst into laughter, as if he had just heard the world\u2019s most funniest joke: \u201cAren\u2019t you just at 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm? In the eyes of those inner sect disciples, you\u2019re similar to dog feces. Do not think that after coming out of the sect\u2019s world, you would be my king. Do not attempt to abuse your power here. After all, from the looks of it, you do not even have enough capability to do so!\u201dZhang Long was furious as cold Qi started to rise and emanate throughout his whole body. His eyes were filled to the brim with murderous intentions, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to die today.\u201dChen Xiang did not know how Chen Furong found such an opinionated guy. It seemed that in his eyes, people who were not in a sect were just ants.At this time, the crowd had all retreated. A battle with an expert in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, would have a very large backlash, but at the same time they were also very excited about the upcoming match. This was because, if what they heard is true, then to get the rewards Chen Xiang had to defeat the Martial Art Sect\u2019s disciple! Just viewing their battle could be considered very fortunate, after all this was a Martial Art Sect\u2019s Disciple! No doubt, this match would give many benefits to the observing martial artists.The ground was covered with splinters of wood, which was all due to Chen Xiang\u2019s previous stomp that had destroyed the entire tournament stage. Chen Furong retreated back, he was very confident in Zhang Long. Chen Furong thought that Chen Xiang would definitely die this time, and then the Chen Family would be completely annexed by the Yao Family. This would lead to his relations with that Yao Family Member in the Martial Arts Sect to become much better.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re older than me, do you think winning against me right now could be considered glorious? I\u2019m only sixteen years old!\u201d Chen Xiang said with a smile, but this expression seemed like he was smiling yet not, creating a considerable paradox.If he hadn\u2019t spoke, everyone here really would have forgotten about his age. Thinking about this, everyone sighed in their hearts. Only at sixteen years of age, he already had such accomplishments. This was definitely one very prestigious and powerful teenager.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll allow you to have one move. I will stand here unmoving, but after that I\u2019ll act with no mercy.\u201d Zhan Long had just arrived and Chen Furong had told him that Chen Xiang was only in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Because Zhong Long was in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he was very disdainful of the fact that the other party was an alchemist and most certainly not focused on the martial path, so of course he is quite weak.In the regular world, anyone in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm was already considered to be one of the top martial artists. But the disciples from the Martial Art Sects could also absorb richer Spirit Qi, as well as eat spirit grade food and dan. Their True Qi exercises were also very good, with all of these factors combined, the people in the regular world could not hope to match the sect\u2019s level of martial skill.\u201cYou\u2019ll let me have a single move?\u201dChen Xiang\u2019s voice was emotionless, but he was secretly delighted in his heart. An 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert was about to be struck by his fist with no retaliation. Not to mention Zhong Long, even if it was someone in 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm would definitely not feel fine afterwards.Zhang Long sneered and said, \u201cYou must have to squeeze out all your power in this one attack, because it\u2019ll be the last one of your life! Afterwards, you are dead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to attack!\u201d Chen Xiang retreated a few steps. Inside his heart he was secretly very pleased, he did not think that there would be such an arrogant idiot in this world.Zhang Long smiled disdainfully, his whole body shook a bit as a pure white mist was emitted from his body, subsequently transforming into a strong Qi aura. It formed a Qi cover that enveloped his whole body. The whole crowd could feel the Qi aura s.h.i.+eld and even see how st.u.r.dy it is. This was because when the Qi s.h.i.+eld was formed, the broken pieces of wood bordering it had instantaneously turned into powder.\u201cYou sure enough have some means, but it\u2019s merely at this level. You have let me down!\u201d Chen Xiang thought in his heart, while operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and mobilizing the five elements of True Qi in his body.Last time, when he was in 5th level of Mortal Martial Realm, he defeated Chen Yihan using the very same five elements True Qi, fusing and transforming them into the Universal Force. This was a chaotic ancient force that has existed since the beginning of time. It was the power that formed heaven and earth, it\u2019s true might was unfathomable. However, Chen Xiang\u2019s Universal Force was only in embryonic stages.Yet it was still extremely terrifying. The last time he casted it, his entire body went through unbearable pain, but now it was a completely different matter. He was now in the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, moreover his body had gone through refinement in the Immortal and Devil Pool, slowly transforming his body into an immortal and devil body. Now, his body was entirely capable of withstanding this ancient Universal Force.This could be said to be his ace in the hole, his strongest card which he rarely used. When he saw that the opposing party in front of him was an idiot who wanted to die, he would certainly not refuse and definitely comply with the other party\u2019s wishes! When his opponent died, he would let them know and feel with there body what was called people beyond people, skies beyond skies.[TLN: Basically means \u2018\u2018No matter how good you think you are, there is always someone out there that is better\u2019. In the raws it was only half of the original idiom \u2018Skies beyond skies\u2019, but I added it all, the full idiom gives a better and more complete message.]The Five Elements True Qis soon fused together within Chen Xiang, transforming itself into the Universal Force. It surged into his arms, yet did not reveal a trace of it\u2019s existence. At this moment, Chen Xiang leapt and rushed towards Zhang Long!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Prelude Of WarSeeing Chen Xiang come towards him, moreover, not even releasing any type of breath fluctuations, Zhang Long pursed his lips and showed a contemptuous sneer.Chen Xiang's speed was not fast, after all he was going to attack a standing target, but upon his fist was the universal force from the fusion of Five Elements True Qis.\"[Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]!\" Chen Xiang arrived in front of Zhang Long. Chen Xiang\u2019s fists rumbled as they moved. Suddenly, above his two fists, a translucent tiger head appeared. The tiger head opened it\u2019s big jaws and directly penetrated Zhang Long\u2019s proud Qi aura s.h.i.+eld, striking unhindered on his chest.The Qi s.h.i.+eld was broken in an instant, both Chen Furong and Zhang Long were fiercely startled in their hearts, but before either of them could react, the fist had already arrived in front of Zhang Long. Chen Xiang\u2019s fist, which contained that mysterious power, struck flatly on Zhang Long\u2019s chest.As the fist landed on Zhang Long\u2019s chest, he felt an endless amount of power madly gus.h.i.+ng into his body and decimating every inch of his body as quickly as possible. In that very moment, he felt various kinds of pain exploding throughout his body, and then lost his consciousness, lost forever from this world.The entire crowd was petrified like statues, but they also could not help but continuously replay the scene from just a moment ago in their minds . Chen Xiang blasted his fist, penetrating that formidable Qi s.h.i.+eld, as it struck unhindered on Zhang Long\u2019s chest. Instantly, a blood mist burst out from where his body used to be, exploding from within. It was like his body was a tomato that had just been ruthlessly squashed on the ground, flattened into a red mus.h.!.+Just one fist from Chen Xiang, and Zhang Long, who was in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, became meat putty! That blood mist was still floating within the wide field, drifting with the wind, intermittently exuding a fishy smell. This caused a feeling of nausea to rise within everyone's throat. The crowd watching were shocked to their very core, this scene had forever etched itself into their minds!Chen Xiang looked indifferent, \u2018Humph\u2019 he snorted in low voice, waving his hand and releasing his true Qi fire, burning that meat putty on the ground. Afterwards, he picked up Zhang Long\u2019s storage pouch and threw it into his.\u201cI defeated the Sect disciple, now give me the True Elemental Dan!\u201dChen Xiang looked coldly at Chen Furong, although he had killed Zhang Long, Chen Xiang knew in his heart that he would not be punished. In his opinion, such a proud, arrogant and supercilious guy would never be acknowledged by any of the Martial Art Sects! Not to mention the fact that Zhang Long had violated their rules and abused his powers in the regular world.Chen Furong\u2019s white eyebrows were madly twitching, with bloodshot eyes, he looked grim and terrifying. He was furious, he had not expected Chen Xiang to be so strong. Only one punch, and Zhang Long had exploded from within. Even for Chen Furong, this feat would be very difficult to achieve.\u201cI can not give it to you!\u201d Chen Furong yelled.\u201cWhy?\u201d Chen Xiang coldly and forcefully asked.\u201cIt is because you killed Yao Tianhua and also a Yao Family Elder! Due to killing members from the Martial Art Tournament managing family, you cannot be rewarded.\u201d Chen Furong loudly shouted, sending the audience into an uproar. Previously, they had not thought Yao Tianhua was killed by Chen Xiang. Yet now, everyone did not doubt a single bit of it, because Chen Xiang\u2019s strength explained everything.\u201cYou have no evidence, do not speak irresponsibly!\u201d Chen Xiang indifferently said. Considering just the relations.h.i.+p between him and the Yao Family, even if nothing had been revealed, the Chen and Yao Family would still go to war, it was just a matter of time.Chen Furong sneered, \u201cBy using an ancient secret method, we have collected Yao Tianhua\u2019s residual spirit. He told us himself, do you want to hear?\u201dAfter speaking, Chen Furong showed a palm-sized yellow paper with various patterns on it. Upon seeing it, Chen Xiang was very surprised because he knew this was a \u2018Talisman\u201d. It was a very rare, mystical and frightening thing, only a few people knew how to make such a thing.\u2018Talisman Experts\u2019, he had often heard Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou mentioning them, even those two mysterious beauties constantly longed for this vocation.Chen Furong read a spell and poured his True Qi into the talisman. Immediately after, the pattern above the talisman suddenly lit up, and everyone heard a very terrifying voice \u201cChen Xiang killed us, Chen Xiang killed us!\u201dThe voice sounded like it originated from h.e.l.l, extremely terrifying and full of resentment. Hearing it, everyone felt a cold s.h.i.+ver running down their spines!\u201cWhat do you have to say now?\u201d Chen Furong coldly said, he finally revealed his trump card, which can intensify the conflict between the Chen and Yao Family, urging the two families into a full scale war! As long as he helped the Yao Family eliminate the Chen Family, then the Yao Family would no doubt be very grateful to him.With such irrefutable evidence confirming Chen Xiang killed Yao Tianhua, everyone was very shocked. Originally, a few people were still uncertain, but now that uncertainty had vanished in puff of smoke.\u201cCorrect, I killed Yao Tianhua and that Yao family elder.\u201d Chen Xiang calmly said, everyone admired the fact that he can be so calm even at this moment.\u201cWE\u2026WE, THE YAO FAMILY WILL FIGHT WITH THE CHEN FAMILY UNTIL ONE OF US HAS BEEN EXTERMINATED!!!\u201d A middle-aged man with a striking resemblance to Yao Tianhua jumped out and yelled.This was the Yao Family Patriarch, Yao Hong!\u201cThey were the ones who first tried to kill me, they even sent a.s.sa.s.sins! On that day, we of the Chen Family hosted a banquet and invited many major families. You, Yao Family wanted to create trouble, and sent various a.s.sa.s.sins to kill the other family\u2019s children. Through this method, you wanted the other families to become hostile to our Chen family.\u201d Chen Xiang gloomily said. Although he had no conclusive evidence, every single word he said was the truth.\u201cSlanderous accusations! We, the Yao Family, would never do such a thing!\u201d Yao Hong shouted. He knew that Chen Xiang didn't have any evidence. The Yao Family\u2019s a.s.sa.s.sins worked very discretely and made sure to cover up their tracks.Chen Xiang smiled coldly before his body suddenly disappeared and reappeared in front of an old man. This old man was one of the Yao Family Elders. Although this elder could feel somebody coming near him, he failed to act in time. Chen Xiang\u2019s actions were far faster, with a single move he scatter his opponents True Qi.\u201cDo not come near me or I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d Chen Xiang said, his palm struck the head of that Yao Family Elder and stunned him.The Yao Family Elders were the source of the Yao Family\u2019s strength, so the Yao Family Members did not dare act rashly.\u201cChen Xiang, you are definitely dead today. If you surrender yourself, I\u2019ll make sure to leave your corpse intact.\u201d Chen Furong threatened. However, he could not act, otherwise Chen Xiang may very well kill the Yao Family Elder and then Chen Furong would be held responsible for it.Everyone thought that Chen Xiang grabbed the Yao Family Elder as a hostage, but it was far from the truth! He just wanted to use Bai Youyou\u2019s strange martial skill on the Yao Family Elder, which could control the consciousness of the other party and make them speak the truth!Chen Xiang poured his divine sense into the Yao Family Elder\u2019s head, and operated the Qi according to that peculiar exercise. The Yao Family Elder then fell into a sluggish state.\u201cI ask you. Was it your Yao Family who had sent a.s.sa.s.sins to kill the major family\u2019s children?\u201d Chen Xiang asked.\u201cYes!\u201d That Yao Family Elder replied. Hearing the answer, Yao Hong\u2019s complexion suddenly became very ugly as the entire field burst into clamor. Before, when they heard Chen Xiang, they didn\u2019t believe a single bit of it. But now, when a Yao Family Elder admitted to the fact, it was very hard not to believe.\u201cWhy?\u201d Chen Xiang continued with his interrogation.\u201cBecause the Chen Family forces were slowly but steadily growing, once the Chen family stepped into the dan business, it would threaten our Yao Family. So we took the advantage of major families partic.i.p.ating in the Chen Family banquet and tried to kill those families children, making them hostile towards the Chen Family. By doing this, it will be beneficial to our Yao family.\u201d That Yao Family Elder replied.Chen Xiang sneered and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the Yao Family has done many despicable things. Our Chen Family, in order for the general population to get low costing dans, founded the Dan King Hall. Yet the Yao Family vigorously tried to stop us from opening Dan King Hall. Their purpose is evidently clear, and very simple. They want to continue gaining everybody's hard earned spirit coins, making sure you select their Yao family\u2019s high-priced dan shop!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - The Battle StartsYao Hong was furious, he shouted \u201cChen Xiang, in the end, what strange demonic technique did you use to control our Yao Family Elder!?\u201d\u201cChen Xiang, you killed our Yao Family\u2019s peerless genius and now you even want to slander our Yao Family. We, the Yao Family, must eradicate your Chen Family!\u201dChen Xiang coldly laughed and replied \u201cYao Tianhua a peerless genius? Is that why he lost to me? Also, I acted all alone. Why must you pull in my Chen Family? It seems that your Yao family is really worried about our Chen Family affecting your dan business.\u201dAt this time, every single person in the crowd had already cursed the Yao Family multiple times. When the Dan King Hall had just been opened, it was immediately trashed before it could even do business. A lot of people knew about this, and now listening to Chen Xiang say it, they felt what the Yao Family did was truly very insidious.\u201cChen Xiang, release him! You\u2019re a martial artist, so let us fight it out fair and square!\u201d Chen Furong had a new outlook on Chen Xiang\u2019s strength. Even one of the Yao Family Elders was unable to resist one of Chen Xiang\u2019s moves and was instantly held hostage.Chen Xiang coldly said, \u201cChen Furong, you\u2019re no longer a Chen Family member. You were already expelled from our Chen Family. You\u2019re just a traitor to the Chen Family, and according to our rules, any traitor must die!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Chen Xiang\u2019s palm struck the Yao Family Elder\u2019s head, which was like chipping a watermelon. It instantly got torn apart and the grey matter of his brain splashed in all directions. Watching this scene, everyone was stunned. Committing such an action, was nothing short of a declaration of war from Chen Xiang to the Yao Family!\u201cHumph, anyway I\u2019ve already killed two of the Yao Family members. Sc.r.a.pping one more is nothing!\u201d Chen Xiang calmly stated.The Yao Family was very strong, yet Chen Xiang was now standing alone in front of the Yao Family! With how Chen Xiang was acting, he was simply seeking death!As expected, Yao Hong roared, \u201cSurround him, I want him hacked into pieces!\u201d\u201cChen Xiang, this is what you asked for!\u201d Chen Furong knew that he had committed a grave crime and was d.a.m.ned as a traitor, but he was not afraid of it. He believed in the regular world, only a few people in the Chen Family could overpower him.Chen Xiang was suddenly surrounded by several old men. These old men were the Yao Family Elders, two of which were in the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm. Yao Hong was also at the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm. However, Chen Xiang was still just calmly standing there.A lot of people on the field quickly retreated, but around three hundred or so did not move.Yao Hong calmly gazed over these three hundred or so people, the True Qi emanating from some of those people were not weak at all, these people were not pushovers.\u201cChen Tianhu!\u201d Chen Furong recognized one of them and immediately shouted. When he saw several other experts from the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, his heart could not help but beat like crazy. Before, when he went back to the Chen Family, he did not find such experts present.\u201cTraitor! Today is the day you die!\u201d Chen Tianhu took out a broadsword with a tiger-head shaped hilt while walking towards Chen Xiang\u2019s location.The Chen Family had actually arrived at the Yao Family entrance, no one expected this, and even more so that they would bring along with three hundred people!Nonetheless, the Yao Family Experts were now feeling a lot of pressure, because the other side had six experts in 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, while they only had four!\u201cMister Chen, this\u2026\u201d Yao Hong glanced at Chen Furong. Chen Furong was in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and he was backing up the Yao Family, this was why they dared to go to war with the Chen Family.\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d Chen Furong sneered and immediately floated, flying towards Chen Tianhu.At this time, Chen Xiang suddenly disappeared from his location as he leapt fiercely up into the air, arriving in front of Chen Furong. Chen Xiang proceeded to roar, as a large amount of lightning and wind aura Azure True Qi surged out from his mouth. Accompanied by a terrifying roar of an angry dragon, this aura drowned Chen Furong!\u201cKill all the Chen Family members! Leave no one alive!\u201d Yao Hong shouted. At this time, Chen Tianhu, along with his tiger-head broadsword and fifty other strong Chen Family members, rushed towards Yao Hong. Everyone\u2019s Slaughter Qi soared as True Qi exploded from within their bodies.Watching their Patriarch personally take action, every other Chen Family member was reluctant to fall behind. Everyone madly roared, facing the sky and took out their broadswords. In front of thousands of Yao Family members, all the Chen Family members marched forward with a steady pace.The roar of three hundred Chen Family members resounded throughout King City. With each step, the entire field also shook. They were the elites of Chen Family and were completely unafraid of death. They were selected to protect the Chen Family and they would never hesitate to defend their own family!Three hundred people against thousands, the Yao Family had far more people, the distant crowd could not help but get roused and cheer for the Chen Family from the side.Chen Xiang and Chen Furong fought, as the three hundred Chen Family members and thousands of Yao Family members also start fighting. Both battles broke out at the same time, and various roars were mixed together. The entire battlefield was confusing and chaotic, only an instant had pa.s.sed after the battle started, yet more than half of the bricks in entire field had already been destroyed.As long as Chen Furong was occupied with him, Chen Xiang was not worried about Chen Tianhu and others, because they were in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Chen Furong, after suffering the [Azure Dragon Roar] in the sky, had a dignified complexion. This was because, he was absolutely sure that Chen Xiang\u2019s strength was at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Chen Xiang was only sixteen years old, having lived in the regular world with very scarce resources, yet has still managed to reach such a level. Not to mention, that he was also an alchemist.\u201cChen Xiang, I have to admit you are very talented. But this is your matter, the Chen Family\u2019s matter, and no longer has anything to do with me! I am only doing this to gain benefits in the sect. If I help the Yao Family here, I\u2019ll obtain various advantages in the True Martial Sect, therefore I must kill you! I already do no have any sense of belonging and I hate the Chen Family!\u201d Chen Furong sternly shouted with a smile.Chen Xiang maintained total silence as he fused his internal five elements of True Qi. Facing a 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert, who came from a martial arts sect, he could only rely on the Universal True Qi to defeat this opponent.Everyone knew that people from the martial art sets came to watch the King City Martial Art Tournament to select a disciple. Those people were all at least in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. This kind of strength, in the Southern Martial Empire, was extremely rare and their level of strength was also very terrifying.At such a young age, Chen Xiang was going to face one of these experts. A lot of people were also looking forward to this as Chen Xiang\u2019s strength was also unfathomable. Just a moment ago, he had killed a Martial Art Sect\u2019s disciple who was in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm with a single punch!\u201cHumph, I did not expect the Chen Family members to be such idiots. You are sending a mere brat to contain me! If it were those six experts in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, then perhaps you would have had an opportunity to escape! But now you can only die along with them! The Chen Family is finished!\u201d From Chen Furong\u2019s body, a red True Qi emerged, covering his hands and feet as his eyes gradually reddened up.Seeing this, Chen Xiang retreated a few steps. For the first time, he was going to fight with a 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert. This was one of the strongest enemies he had ever faced, sensing the level of True Qi, Chen Xiang gradually became more and more dignified.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - The White Tiger Divine FistThe Yao Family had a lot of people, but when compared to the Chen Family\u2019s six 8th level Mortal Martial Realm Experts and their three hundred or so elites, their overall strength was weaker. The Yao Family members were slowly losing their ground as they were forced inside the Yao Family estate, but that strong giant door of the Yao Family was blasted to smithereens by Chen Tianhu as the Chen Family forced their way through.Meanwhile, that giant field outside had been turned into Chen Xiang and Chen Furong\u2019s personal battlefield.Chen Furong\u2019s hands and feet were wrapped in that red True Qi. Moreover, a wild and savage breath could be sensed emanating from them. The red True Qi covering both his hands slowly started to take shape, resembling a beast\u2019s. With two strong and thick arms with sharp claws, it looked very frightening.His legs were also the same, all his limbs were also wrapped in the red True Qi and surprisingly, all of them had been transformed into that of a beast\u2019s, which looked extremely tough. Waves of strong and fierce True Qi flew towards Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang retreated a few steps while frowning. He looked at Chen Furong and noticed that both of his eyes had completely turned red, resembling that of a fierce wolf.\u201cIs this the True From of the 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm?\u201d Chen Xiang said in his heart.The 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm was the True Form Realm. Depending on the individual\u2019s cultivating exercise, a form was congealed from True Qi in their dantian. Ordinarily, these can be divided into two common types. One is the bird or beast form while the other was a weapon form. Of course there are other types of forms, such as lotus, star, or lightning form. Every single one of these are determined according to their cultivation exercise.If the True Qi congealed out a bird or beast form, then you could use the special power of that anima. If one congealed out a weapon, then they could form a very powerful \u2018Weapon Apparition'. If at that time, they were also using a weapon, then the \u2018Weapon Apparition\u2019 and the one they were holding would fuse together, becoming even more powerful.Right in front of Chen Xiang, Chen Furong had actually congealed a wolf type from his True Qi!\u201c[Angry Wolf Fist]!\u201d Chen Furong blasted a fist in air. Immediately after, the place where he stood was unable to withstand the sudden release of powerful and violent True Qi. His feet formed two craters as he punched out. A red light also broke out, this red light burst open in blink of an eye into countless wolf heads with their jaws wide open, forming a makes.h.i.+ft wall as they closed in on Chen Xiang.These wolf heads created from True Qi contained tyrannical force. Chen Xiang was sure if he was. .h.i.t directly, he would still suffer heavily despite his powerful body. Chen Xiang sent out a shove of his hand and gathered the Universal True Qi from his dantian and released outwards. That Qi Aura cemented a wall which stood firmly in front of him.The Universal True Qi was created by fusing the five elements of True Qi, yet it was colorless and invisible. It could be consider to be transparent, but people could still sense it's peculiar vibe.The numerous wolf heads created from True Qi came flying towards Chen Xiang releasing waves after waves of Qi. After the ground came in contact with the Qi waves, it was blasted into many pieces.Those numerous True Qi filled violent wolf heads struck the Qi Aura wall that was protecting Chen Xiang\u2019s body. The strength of both True Qis were quite similar as their clash resulted in a thunderous roar. Due to the collision, a Qi shockwave was created, it was similar to a undulated wave that spread all four directions. The bricks within the wide field shook along with the Qi wave, which in turn, were smashed into powder one after another.The original field, which was entirely covered with bricks, had now become an uneven ground of mud. In front of Chen Xiang, an even deeper crater had been formed.When Chen Furong saw that his initial attack failed to do anything, he immediately flew over. Those giant wolf like legs of his treaded on the ground, along his path, many small craters appeared. With each step he took, it shook the ground along with thunderous sounds. It was as if a giant angry elephant was madly rus.h.i.+ng through the field.Chen Furong was shocked by the fact that Chen Xiang was capable of even releasing a bizarre and powerful True Qi that could even withstand such an attack. But Chen Furong still believed that no matter what happened, Chen Xiang was still just a 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm teenager. Whether it was Chen Xiang\u2019s combat experience, or how vibrant his True Qi, was, neither of those could even be compare with Chen Furong\u2019s. He was completely confident in his victory.\u201cArrogant little brat! Today I\u2019ll send you off to heaven!\u201d Chen Furong grinned ferociously as he fiercely jumped out. Both of his legs stuck close together as they emitted a red light. Quick as lightning, he diagonally slammed down from high above.\u201cYou\u2019re just a wolf, nothing more than a mangy mutt! What\u2019s so impressive about that?\u201d Chen Xiang sneered. Watching Chen Furong falling down from the sky, the Universal True Qi gathered around Chen Xiang\u2019s fists as he simultaneously released Slaughter Qi. He punched out his fists lighting fast. As his attack cut through the air, a thunderous tiger roar resounded.\u201c[White Tiger Divine Fist]!\u201d Chen Xiang welcomed Chen Furong\u2019s slam attack, which was similar to an immense mountain falling down. As the attack desended, Chen Xiang fist struck on the dead center of Chen Furong\u2019s soles. Suddenly, a tiger\u2019s roar soared into the sky. As the Qi waves swept forth in all directions, the sand was blown away from the blast, and a few cracks could also be seen on the ground.Chen Furong thought that his attack would simply destroy all of Chen Xiang\u2019s defense and plunge him into a dead end. Who could have thought that in a blink of an eye, Chen Furong\u2019s foot would suddenly be struck by an immense and unfathomable amount of force that smashed into his whole thigh!His leg had already been utterly decimated under Chen Xiang\u2019s [White Tiger Divine Fist]! The entire crowd was horrified, and to their shock, Chen Furong\u2019s leg appeared withered as if all its vital essence had been extracted.This was [White Tiger Divine Fist]\u2019s formidability. This was also the first time Chen Xiang had used this skill. After using it, not only did a frightening power burst out, but it released an seemingly endless amount of Slaughter Qi, engulfing all of the vitality from the opposite party.\u201cOld mutt! This is the consequence of underestimating an enemy!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly said before he suddenly appeared right in front of Chen Furong.Chen Furong felt a mix of surprise, anger and hate, all at the same time. He still did not know what type of True Qi Chen Xiang had used just a moment ago. Chen Furong had never seen or even heard of such a thing. This True Qi appeared to be without any attribute similar to a physical force, yet at the same time it wasn\u2019t.\u201cDo not be complacent, now you\u2019re also burned out!\u201d Chen Furong blasted his fist, countering Chen Xiang\u2019s blow. He believed that Chen Xiang had completely exhausted his True Qi for that attack from just a moment ago. After all, Chen Xiang was only at 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, and his True Qi was bound to not be as vigorous as Chen Furong\u2019s.But Chen Furong was completely, horribly, wrong. His fist rumbled as he punched out, but Chen Xiang just counter attacked Chen Furong with yet another [White Tiger Divine Fist], and just like before, a tiger roar could be heard again as an immense power burst out and surged into Chen Furong\u2019s arm, completely destroying it!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Due to the impact force, Chen Furong flew back and spat out a mouthful of blood. He had not only he lost a leg and an arm, but also, just a moment ago, Chen Xiang had violently shook Chen Furong\u2019s Five Zhang and Six Fu with the help of [White Tiger Divine Fist] .[TLN: Five Zhang and Six Fu in nothing more than the internal organs, in chinese medicine Five Zhang are Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung and Kidney while Six Fu are Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder, Stomach and Sanjiao. San Jiao is the meridians connecting the major organs. In future I will continue to use Five Zhang and Six Fu, it just basically means internal organs.]The crowd watching was shocked, that [White Tiger Divine Fist] from Chen Xiang was not only completely overbearing but the Slaughter Qi gave off an oppressive pressure. Everyone a.s.sumed that this level of attack should consume a large amount of True Qi and could be cast out once was already formidable enough. However, no one thought that Chen Xiang could still cast it again with such ease.Once again a sandstorm was created in the field as Chen Xiang slowly walked towards Chen Furong. In an unemotional, yet angry tone, he said, \u201cYou wounded my father, sent people to trash Dan King Hall, and also collaborated with the Yao Family to destroy our Chen Family. I will not let such a traitor die so easily!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Forgone ConclusionChen Xiang was in the beginner stage of the Immortal and Devil body. He also had the heaven defying Yin and Yang Divine Vein, and an immensely powerful divine exercise. Due to all these factors, at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he had the strength to defeat a 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert!Even Chen Xiang didn\u2019t expect that the Universal True Qi, created from fusing the five elements of True Qi, would be so frightening. He was also shocked speechless by the power released when using the Divine Exercise Of The Four Symbols.\u201cWhat\u2026 What are you going to do? I\u2019m a True Martial Sect\u2019s disciple, if you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Chen Furong saw the Slaughter Qi soaring from Chen Xiang, Chen Furong finally realized that death was in front of him. Despite Chen Xiang destroying both an arm and a leg, Chen Furong could still not accept the fact that Chen Xiang was stronger than him!\u201cImpossible\u2026.Impossible! I am in the 9th level of the Moral Martial Realm. Only a 10th level of Mortal Martial Realm Expert can beat me! You\u2019re only sixteen years old, you can\u2019t possibly be in the 10th level of Mortal Martial Realm\u2026\u201d Chen Furong panicked while speaking, at the same time struggling to crawl away on the ground.Chen Xiang coldly said \u201cIf I was in 10th level of Mortal Martial Realm, you would have just become meat putty on the sidewalk. GO TO h.e.l.l!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Chen Xiang roared as True Qi burst out of his mouth accompanied by azure lightning. It was madly flas.h.i.+ng within the storm and accompanied by a strong wind aura. It was as if the powerful True Qi was a waterfall falling from the ninth heaven as it struck Chen Furong\u2019s body. Thunderclap sounds rang throughout the whole field, but not alone, as it was also accompanied by Chen Furong\u2019s equally loud and blood-curdling screams.Chen Xiang\u2019s complexion was extremely cold and hard. Ever since he saw his father wounded, he swore that he would kill Chen Furong!\u201cYou are a 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm martial artist, but in my eyes, you are nothing but an ant. Enjoy a few things before dying!\u201d Chen Xiang ruthlessly roared.Again, he casted the [Azure Dragon Roar], followed by the [Azure Dragon Claw], [Storm Killing Fist], [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist], and the [Fire King Fist]. He casted these several martial techniques he had grasped and was proficient in, one after the other, striking Chen Furong ruthlessly.Watching the scene that was occurring in front of them, a s.h.i.+ver ran down everybody\u2019s spine outside the field. They all had a frightened face, they had an extremely hard time believing that a not yet seventeen year old teenager had such a vibrant True Qi, and also defeated a 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert! No, not defeated, madly battered and completely dominated!Chen Furong was now resembling a mud ball, his whole body, from head to toe, was struck and broken by Chen Xiang\u2019s top-grade martial techniques. Chen Furong soon died in agony as Chen Xiang removed the storage pouch from Chen Furong\u2019s waist and then incinerated the corpse into ashes. Afterwards, Chen Xiang stepped past the Yao Family\u2019s broken main door.\u201cDead! He just died like this!? This child is simply a monster!\u201d An old martial artist said. If he had not seen Chen Xiang\u2019s strength a moment ago with his very own eyes, he would simply be unable to believe that Chen Furong, a 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert, had been brutally bashed into the ground and killed by a teenaged martial artist.Of course, just a moment ago, the strength shown by Chen Xiang was almost unbelievable!Everyone looking at the now tranquil but messy field could hear the sound of fighting that was occurring past the Yao Family gate, it was similar to a daydream for them!This was the might of a powerful martial artist! With just a single battle, an entire field which could accommodate tens of thousands of people had become completely messed up. Extremely strong martial artists could definitely possess such an overwhelming force, this was definitely no legend!Chen Xiang arrived inside the Yao Family Estate, he saw many scattered body parts on the ground. He yelled out \u201cDad! I\u2019ve come to lend you a hand!\u201dChen Xiang had actually arrived! Even those on his side like Chen Tianhu, and Chen Haohai could not help but shudder. The fact that Chen Xiang arrived here meant that Chen Furong was no longer a threat. This was only possible if Chen Furong had been defeated by Chen Xiang!All of the Yao Family members knew that Chen Xiang and Chen Furong were fighting, but now Chen Xiang had won. In other words, Chen Xiang\u2019s strength was comparable, no, even above a 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm expert! Now the Yao Family\u2019s doom was forgone conclusion and simply inevitable!\u201cThis is not possible, you cannot defeat someone from 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm! Only someone who is in the 10th level of Mortal Martial Realm could do it so fast!\u201d Yao Hong shouted. He was the Yao Family Patriarch, the current predicament of the Yao Family was all because of him. It was his decision to eradicate the Chen Family.Chen Xiang jumped several dozen zhang high into the air. An azure light emitted from his palm as he slammed it downwards. Endless True Qi surged out from his palm along with the azure light. A huge azure palm that was immense as a mountain appeared in the sky, moreover it was pressing down below onto the Yao Family!That palm was made purely from the Qi aura, it was dozens of zhang wide and covered the entire garden, yet still with such a strong True Qi gus.h.i.+ng out from it. With just a glance, everyone there could tell how vigorous Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi was.That giant azure palm in the sky fell, as a large number of houses and hundreds of Yao Family also fell under its immense pressure. Not only did all the houses under the palm get smashed into pieces, it also resulted in the bones of everyone under it to be cracked, blood gus.h.i.+ng out from their mouths. The strength was so horrifying that everyone's flesh and blood simply flew off, pressed on the ground, turning it into human meat paste.A huge palm imprint was left in the ground. Everyone watching was deeply shocked by this, and many could not help but retch. Some even threw their weapons onto the ground, other emitted terrified shrieks, while many even fled the Yao Family courtyard! All of the people running were Yao Family members!Chen Tianhu\u2019s mouth twitched, he had not expected that in just few months his son would have such frightening power! With just a move, Chen Xiang could kill hundreds of people.Just a moment ago, Chen Xiang had released all of his Azure Dragon True Qi. Releasing such a soul shaking strike, everyone watched as his complexion turned pale and he started falling from the sky. They all guessed that he must have over consumed his True Qi.\u201cKill all of them! The Chen Family members have consumed too much of their True Qi! We cannot miss this opportunity!\u201d Yao Hong roared, wielding a longsword as he flew up.Just a moment ago, around three hundred Chen Family members were fighting against thousands of Yao Family members, it really was very consuming. Chen Tianhu and the others in the 8th level Mortal Martial Realm were up against many 6th or 7th level of Mortal Martial Realm Experts. Moreover, in order to prevent the casualties of their Chen Family members, they had to help the injured retreat, increasing their burdens. The fact that they were all alive and standing was nothing short of a miracle.\u201cChen Family Members! All of you, get behind me!\u201d Chen Xiang loudly shouted. All the Chen Family Elites in the courtyard soon flew behind him. Just from the spectacle before, they were all filled with admiration for Chen Xiang.\u201cDad, just leave these old men to me, you deal with those other minions!\u201d Said Chen Xiang as he rushed towards Yao Hong and the other high level Yao Family members.Chen Xiang and the others were originally worried, but when they saw the vigorous and vibrant True Qi suddenly surge out from Chen Xiang\u2019s body, they all felt relieved. Yet in their hearts, they were still shocked. It was still wasn\u2019t clear to them how much True Qi Chen Xiang\u2019s body actually possessed.\u201c[White Tiger Divine Fist]!\u201d Chen Xiang flew above the opposing party and suddenly punched out a thunderous fist. A large amount of golden True Qi surged out from his fist, In blink of an eye, cementing into a giant golden fist, tens of zhang wide, which was exuding an extremely large amount of Slaughter Qi.Just a moment ago, a huge azure palm appeared, and now a huge golden fist! It was also transformed from a frightening Qi aura, but was of a more destructive metal attribute True Qi!This White Tiger True Qi also contained an engulfing Slaughter Qi!The huge golden fist flew, as the Qi waves bursting out like a typhoon sweeping away the clouds. A large and thick slice of the earth had been lifted up and was currently flying towards that crowd of Yao Family experts. As the golden fist pa.s.sed over the ground, it started shaking from the violent True Qi undulations, as the earth eventually cracked into numerous deep fissures.This power was absolutely comparable to a falling mountain!Yao Hong, who was watching this thunderous and powerful fist advancing towards them, could not help but be utterly shocked. At this time, every member of the opposing party facing this terrifying blow wanted to run away. But as they moved to do so, they found that the Qi waves had intertwined with their bodies and they were unable to escape!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - True Elemental DanThe [White Tiger Divine Fist] shoveled out a deep canyon in the ground, therein covering all of the Yao Family\u2019s experts. Tyrannical Qi Aura ravaged their body and the instant the divine fist struck them, they could clearly feel the muscle and bones in their body exploding. Furthermore, this blow completely dispersed the True Qi in their body!\u201cAll of you, stop! Your Yao Family Patriarch and Elders have been defeated!\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s thunderous voice resounded through the entire Yao Family courtyard. Every Yao family member, whether they were high or low, clearly heard his declaration. The people outside the courtyard in the field were also surprised. Chen Xiang had only entered a moment ago, but had already defeated the Yao Family.Rumor had it, that a single powerful martial artist could easily destroy an entire city. Now Chen Xiang had easily defeated all of a family\u2019s elite martial artists, including three 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Experts! Moreover, they were all defeated by a single blow from Chen Xiang, this proves that the rumors were definitely not false!Yao Hong\u2019s and all the Yao Family Elder\u2019s bones were completely crushed. Despite this, they were still not dead, merely in excrutiating and gruesome pain. They were all glaring at Chen Xiang with eyes full of hatred.The Yao Family Patriarch and Elders had all been defeated. Other Yao Family members did not dare to resist, their elites had long been defeated. If they tried to resume the battle, it would completely futile and meaningless.\u201cChen Xiang\u2026 You\u2026 Just wait for our Yao Family seniors to seek revenge!\u201d Yao Hong knew he was definitely going to die today, but also knew that the Yao Family seniors would not sit idly by.Chen Xiang laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s good, it would better if they come. I\u2019ll send them off so you can have a good long talk with them!\u201d While speaking, Chen Xiang created a short knife purely from Qi Aura. Soon, the small dagger was sent flying straight into Yao Gong\u2019s head.That Qi aura dagger pierced Yao Hong\u2019s head which immediately exploded right after. Yao Hong\u2019s head was completely blasted into smithereens. Watching this gruesome spectacle, everyone felt nauseous as fear seeped into their hearts. They worried what they could possibly do to resist if Chen Xiang were to act the same way against them.Once the other members of the Yao Family saw such gruesome methods of execution, they all became obedient and surrendered themselves while begging for mercy.At this moment, the dan aristocratic family which had stood proudly for eons had, in such a short period of time, been completely decimated. Moreover, this disaster was something they brought upon themselves. Yet, the part which is the most unbelievable and overshadowed all of this, was not the fact they lost, but the fact that the one responsible for such heavy destruction and damage to the Yao Family was from a single person who was not yet even seventeen years old!Chen Tianhu and the rest never expected such a final outcome!\u201cXiang Er, you lead the injured to leave first. You are also no doubt tired, leave the aftermath to us!\u201d Chen Tianhu shouted loudly. His eyes were majestic as he glanced at the Yao Family members, all of them could not help but tremble in response.Chen Xiang nodded his head, and left with hundreds of injured Chen Family members, returning to Dan King Hall. He received the dans he needed to heal himself, he had completely consumed all his Azure Dragon and White Tiger True Qi today, it could be said he had consumed a little less than half of his True Qi, and the other three True Qis he had were also nearly empty due to his usage of the Universal Force. It is the first time he has expended his True Qi to such a degree.Inside Dan King Hall, Chen Luzhong and Dan King Meng Bo had just learned the outcome of the battle. The result had stunned the two old men as they repeatedly shook their heads again and again. Even they could not believe that Chen Xiang had such a terrifying strength, not to mention his strong talent in alchemy!\u201cThis guy, it would be good if he entered a Martial Art Sect as soon as possible. This place would definitely be unable to withstand his meteoric rise!\u201d Chen Luzhong sighed. It was very difficult to find any suitable rivals for Chen Xiang here, but if he were to enter one of those Martial Art Sects, he would be near the bottom of the pack.This was also why, once a martial artist reached a certain level of strength, they were unwilling to stay in the regular world. Even if they were very powerful there, if they did not move on, their strength would come to a standstill. As long as a martial artist arrived at that step, all of them would want to go further.The Yao Family was fully annexed by the Chen Family. Every property across the entire Southern Martial Empire that formerly belonged to the Yao Family was now owned by the Chen Family. Without a doubt, this made them one of the most formidable forces. Also, the Chen Family was now the undisputed number one dan family in the Southern Martial Empire.Several days past as this event spread over the entire Southern Martial Empire! Other families knew that war between the Chen and Yao Families was inevitable, but had never expected it to end so soon. Moreover, Chen Xiang\u2019s name also became widespread as it was heard again and again due his astonis.h.i.+ng performance in this major conflict.Inside the Imperial Palace, a handsome man with an extremely pale complexion said to a middle aged man with a majestic air, \u201cFather Emperor, are we really going to forget that Chen Xiang stole our [Dragon Martial Technique]!? And the fact that he seriously injured me?\u201dSong Wu loudly scolded \u201cWhat should we do then? Lead troops to try and destroy the Chen Family? They have six 8th level Mortal Martial Realm experts, as well as Chen Xiang whose strength is comparable to that of the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!? Chen Xiang did not actually kill you, that\u2019s already quite benevolent! You think you are clever, but those things are only petty tricks!\u201dSong Wu was the Emperor, but facing the Chen Family, even he must concede his prestige. Furthermore, he and the Chen Family held no grudges between them. That day at the tournament when he decided to not stay there with the seriously injured Song Nanming was truly a wise decision. Had he stayed with the Yao Family that day, perhaps both he and Song Nanming would have been ma.s.sacred along with the Yao Family!\u201cI...I...I cannot reconcile with him!\u201d Song Nanming grinded his teeth and spat out. During this period of time, he had been beaten until his body was decimated. If not for the aid of the good healing dans, he simply would not have the slightest chance of recovering.\u201cHumph. So what if you cannot reconcile? The Yao Family is now history while the Chen Family will not do anything to threaten us. They do not care about being the Emperor, after all they want to manage the aftermath of their war! You are going to obedient for this period of time.\u201d Song Wu coldly said as he left.The Yao Family courtyard had become the new Chen Family residence. The destroyed entrance and front area from the battle would soon be repaired as all of the Chen Family members migrated from Wohu City to reside in King City!The forces who previously had very good relations.h.i.+ps with the Yao Family had quickly abandoned them and showed good will towards the Chen Family. These days, many people brought gifts to Dan King Hall, all of them being very high in quality. From these gifts, Chen Xiang only picked a few herbs and left the rest for the Chen Family.After killing Chen Furong, Chen Xiang found the [True Elemental Dan] in his victim's storage pouch. This was a High-Grade Spirit Level Dan, extremely rare. Even for Meng Bo, the Dan King of the Southern Martial Empire, it would be extremely difficult to refine this dan successfully!\u201cIt has a vast amount of pure True Qi! After eating it, the True Qi within it can instantly be refined. Indeed a great dan! I wonder when I will be able to personally refine it?Chen Xiang looked at the dan, which had an appearance similar to a transparent sh.e.l.l. At the center, a ball of pure white Qi was present.Su Meiyao was appreciatively holding Chen Xiang\u2019s Flame Dragon's Brilliant Furnace. Bai Youyou was also looking on from the side. After the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace recognized Chen Xiang as it\u2019s master, Bai Youyou was no longer afraid of it\u2019s scorching Qi.Su Meiyao said, \u201cThose Martial Art Sect\u2019s alchemists can be considered to quite good if they can refine a High-Grade Spirit Level Dan. That\u2019s quite hard, although it did not mean much. After all, only those alchemists who can refine Profound Grade Dans are considered to be of great importance.\u201dCurrently, Chen Xiang was only able to refine Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans and intended to learn how to refine High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, or possibly even Low-Grade Spirit Level Dans. Only after achieving this objective, would he head towards those big martial sects.\u201cTwo sisters, is it possible for the Yao Family seniors who are in those Martial Art Sects to come back and retaliate against the Chen Family?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. He was worried that after he left, the Yao Family seniors would come for revenge.\u201cYou do not need to worry about the Martial Art Sects learning about what happened here. This time, Chen Furong and Zhang Long broke the rules first and acted against the regular world\u2019s people. Even if they were killed, no investigation will be launched. Not to mention, the fact is, they were simply nothing in the eyes of the True Martial Sect. There is no way they would break the rules simply for their deaths. If they did, the True Martial Sect would be targeted by all the other sects\u201d, explained Su Meiyao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Alchemy SufferingsThere were many Martial Art Sects and they diametrically oppose each other. All of them could not wait for someone to be a little bit in the wrong and grab their weakness. Chen Xiang was somewhat surprised. Like Zhang Long, this young 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Pract.i.tioner was still not of any importance. It was highly likely that there were many powerful martial artists inside those sects. Only Martial Artists with extraordinary potential and a very promising future could be considered to be of great importance.After things calmed down, Chen Xiang started learning alchemy and growing spirit herbs. He didn\u2019t use the True Elemental Dan because Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou advised him that it would be most effective to consume it when he encountered a bottleneck.After the Chen Family took over the Yao Family\u2019s dan businesses, their overall price dropped down. This made many martial pract.i.tioners extremely excited as they eagerly supported the Chen Family. Due to this, the Chen Family was very popular among the ma.s.ses and their action would be a great aid in their future development as a powerhouse.In this world, the law of the jungle is rampant. In just one day, all of the wealth acc.u.mulated over eons by the Yao Family now belonged to the Chen Family! They had brought this upon themselves, if they had not opposed the Chen Family they would still be prospering.After the annexation of the Yao Family, Chen Xiang simply did not have a shortage of spirit herbs he could use for alchemy. He was currently picking some spirit herbs from the former Yao Family herbal garden, preparing to refine a High-Grade Mortal Level Dan. Not only did the difficulty in refining a High-Grade Mortal Level Dan increase several times over, it also required much more precious spirit herbs.There were not many types of High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, and even fewer types were widespread and frequently used. These were the most useful for martial pract.i.tioners but also seldomly refined. These were also the types of dans alchemists need to master, so obviously when Chen Xiang choose to learn how to refine High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, he choose one of these to refine.\u201cHigh-Grade Mortal Level Dan\u2019s ranking on the tier list of dans is somewhat awkward! How should I put this? Undoubtedly in the martial arts world, there are many martial pract.i.tioner above 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and they are all quite rich! These people have high requirements, so when they buy pills they would obviously not choose Mortal Level Pills but rather buy Low-Grade Spirit Level Dans instead. Moreover, it would be bought in vast quant.i.ties and after they eat it, it would give them greater benefits!\u201d Said Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang asked \u201cSo in other words, those in Martial Art Sects at the 8th and 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm are relatively poor?\u201dSu Meiyao answered \u201cOf course. So they can only buy Mortal Level Dans with their wealth, but you have to know that even the effects of High-Grade Mortal Level Dans on the 8th and 9th level Mortal Martial Realm Martial Pract.i.tioners do not have any obvious benefits.\u201cSo you need to master just the most expensive High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, which are the Cultivating Qi Dan, the Grand Elemental Dan and the Transforming Essence Dan.\u201d said Su MeiyaoChen Xiang already knew some of these dans and they were indeed among the most expensive Mortal Level High-Grade Dans. After taking them, their effects were also very evident and helpful. Cultivating Qi Dan mainly elevated someone's True Qi quality so that martial pract.i.tioners could refine their True Qi into a purer form.Grand Elemental Dan was a cultivation boosting dan. After consuming it, a large amount of Spirit Qi was released, which could be directly refined into a large amount of True Qi without taking into account thin Spirit Qi or spiritual veins. Last was the Transforming Essence Dan, this dan would directly transform internal True Qi into spiritual power and was mainly used to enlarge the area of divine sense and practice it\u2019s usage.Chen Xiang had the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace, with this sacred level dragonic object, one could accelerate the time inside the alchemy furnace and thereby save a lot of time in the refining process of alchemy.It should be known that some dans take years or even decades for refinement. With the help of the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace, Chen Xiang could drastically shorten the time required.Chen Xiang was going to attempt to refine the Grand Elemental Dan first, because he wanted to take the dan himself and elevate his own power. Only after entering the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, would he enter one of the big sects.There were three main ingredients required for refining the Grand Elemental Dan. Although not much, they were all required to be more than five hundred years old, in addition to twenty other auxiliary materials The oldest of these being a hundred years old and the youngest being fifty or sixty years old. From this alone, the preciousness of a Grand Elemental Dan could be seen. If they failed to refine it, many alchemists would simply cry in despair.\u201cThis stone like fruit is really tricky ah!\u201d Chen Xiang had started refining. Originally, these herbs belonged to the Yao Family and there were only four sets, each of them being worth more than a hundred thousand large spirit coins.Although the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace was more suitable for alchemy and the control of temperature was arbitrary, if one did not know about the degree of heating required by each herb, then even divine furnaces were useless.At this time, Chen Xiang separated his divine sense into twenty or so separate parts and controlled the flame incinerating the twenty different spirit herbs. Moreover, these spirit herbs had to transform into herbal powder at the exact same time, so there needed to not be even the tiniest bit of time difference between them. Meanwhile, Chen Xiang also needed to use all of his brain to refine the various spirit herbs into herbal Spirit Qi. The consumption of divine sense would ordinarily have been too much, even for Chen Xiang. But the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace allowed him to decrease his consumption of divine sense so he did not need to resort to using dans in order to restore his divine sense.Chen Xiang\u2019s divine sense perceived a full day pa.s.sing inside the alchemy furnace, but in actuality, only a small moment had past! This is because the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace sped up the pa.s.sage of time inside it, so there was a large time difference between the two.\u201cf.u.c.king s.h.i.+t! I\u2019m finished!\u201d Chen Xiang was sweating profusely as he watched a clump of colorful mist rising from the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace, he could not help but curse.This was already more than a one hundred thousand large spirit coins which had just suddenly transformed into a puff of colorful smoke. The fact that Chen Xiang didn\u2019t cry was already considered resolute.\u201cWorthy of the t.i.tle, Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace, to not even explode after that!\u201d Su Meiyao giggled and smiled tenderly.\u201cSister Meiyao do not irritate me!\u201d Chen Xiang muttered.Just a moment ago, he had incinerated the spirit herb called Iron Element Fruit and failed. This was because that \u201cIron Element Fruit\u201d wasn\u2019t as hard as he had thought, when he had been baking it, nothing was going wrong, so he suddenly increased the heat of the flames. Who could have thought that the Iron Element Fruit would explode in the blink of an eye! The escaping Spirit Qi from the explosion caused all of the other herbal powders and herbal Spirit Qi to blend into a chaotic mess. This resulted in a variety of reaction with the end result of an explosion, all of which surged out from the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace.\u201cI told you that this fruit is very hard to refine! Even I failed a good number of times when I used this grey fruit! Now when I see someone failing in front of me like I once did, of course I\u2019m going to be delighted!\u201d Su Meiyao stuck out her rosy fragrant tongue and continued to laugh.Every time Chen Xiang refined dans, Su Meiyao would come out. Sometimes, she would wipe Chen Xiang\u2019s sweat, or perhaps gloat. Other times she would encourage him. Occasionally she would also take liberties or tempt Chen Xiang this innocent teenager.Chen Xiang curled his lips and said, \u201cYou can afford the failures but there is no way for me. There are only three sets of ingredients left!\u201d He exclaimed after learning that when Su Meiyao was trying to master alchemy, even with her extensive resources, had actually failed several times.\u201cGood brother, you shouldn\u2019t be so discouraged. I just remembered the past and missed it very much.\u201d Su Meiyao took out a silky handkerchief and sweetly smiled. She then walked towards Chen Xiang and wiped the sweat off his face.Chen Xiang inhaled that refres.h.i.+ng body fragrance that Su Meitao emitted. Feeling her tender beautiful hands occasionally stroking his cheeks made him feel an inexpressible sensation.After a quick break, Chen Xiang continued to refine\u2026.The second time he had failed again, at the exact same stage when he was dealing with the Iron Element Fruit.The third time, he managed to successfully resolve the issue with the Iron Element Fruit but at the last stage of congealing the dan, he could not control the fusion of the various herbal powders and herbal Spirit Qis, resulting in another small explosion inside the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace!\u201cFather is really prodigal ah\u2026 In just a two hour period, I\u2019ve evaporated more than four hundred thousand large spirit coins.\u201d Chen Xiang laid down on the ground, feeling extreme heartache as he watched the scattered mist in the private room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Poisonous NeedleThe more Chen Xiang delved into the mysteries of alchemy and experimented with the higher rank dans, the more he understood why powerful alchemists were so scarce. This was because most people could not afford to consume spirit herbs. Even Chen Xiang, who was talented in comparison to others and also had the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace as support, still continuously failed when trying to refine this High-Grade Mortal Level! Let alone others.\u201cSister Meiyao, give me a kiss, then I\u2019ll have some courage again. Failing again and again, I\u2019ve become fearful.\u201d Chen Xiang timidly said, but after he finished saying those words out loud, he laughed foolishly.Su Meiyao spat, \u201cYou little rascal, to even try to play me for a fool! It was good that you chose me to joke with, you would not have dared to say such things to senior sister. Otherwise your face will be swollen for at least several days.Chen Xiang mischievously laughed and said, \u201cOf course I know, Sister Meiyao, it\u2019s not like you are going to be kissing me for the first time. Kissing again is next to nothing.\u201dThis had occurred when Chen Xiang won the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace, Su Meiyao had, in momentary excitement, kissed Chen Xiang on the cheek. However, she had not expected Chen Xiang to still be thinking about that moment.\u201cNice try. If you mention this again I am gonna ignore you later.\u201d Su Meiyao softly scoffed. Thinking of the day when she kissed Chen Xiang\u2019s cheek, her pretty face could not help but feel slightly hot as two intoxicating flushes emerged. This made her even more enchanting and charming, seeing this, Chen Xiang was stunned.\u201cHumph, hurry up and refine the dans!\u201d Su Meiyao\u2019s face gradually turned even more red as she stomped her feet. Her voice was seductive yet full of anger. She turned into a white light, and then disappeared into the ring.Chen Xiang was somewhat disappointed, but he knew that in order to get the beauty\u2019s heart he first needed to become strong. He rested a moment before seriously trying to refine the dan again. If he fails this time around, he would have to buy more herbs.More than half an hour pa.s.sed before Chen Xiang\u2019s evil laughter resounded in the private room. \u201cHahaha! Your Father has finally succeeded! In just half a day I learned how to successfully refine a Grand Elemental Dan! Haha!\u201dAfter Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou heard that disgusting laugher, they immediately came out from the ring.\u201cDo not ever laugh again in such a nasty way or I\u2019ll knock all your teeth out.\u201d Bai Youyou\u2019s ice cold voice resounded. This immediately made the formerly joyous Chen Xiang look as if he had just eaten dog s.h.i.+t. He quickly stopped laughing, and shut his mouth. He was worried that Bai Youyou would actually knock his teeth out.After Su Meiyao saw this, she giggled.As the Flame Dragon's Brilliant Furnace opened, five dragon eye-sized white dans appeared into view, with quite a bit of spirit Qi wafting from them. However, each dasns costed eighty thousand spirit coins!\u201cThis brat, always hurting other people\u2019s pride. I thought that he would at least fail a dozen times but it seems that only after two or three failures, he succeeded like always.\u201d Su Meiyao, who was very happy in her heart, said while pouting. It was a rather seductive scene to behold.Although Chen Xiang was proud, he still managed to say with a straight face, \u201cThis is all thanks to Sister Meiyao\u2019s guidance and Sister Youyou\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of my fart?\u201d Bai Youyou interrupted him in the middle.\u201cOf course\u2026 This has everything to do with Sister Youyou, because in my heart I\u2019m always thinking how I can help restore both fairy sister\u2019s strength.\u201d Chen Xiang grinningly said.Although Bai Youyou knows that Chen Xiang was just flattering her, she couldn\u2019t help but be slightly touched because Chen Xiang said this in consideration of her.\u201cIn the future, put in a little more effort. When you learn a Devil Skill from me, I\u2019ll start teaching you seriously.\u201d said Bai Youyou. Right after she finished speaking, she quickly returned to the the ring.\u201cBrat, quickly swallow and refine the dan so that you can enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm a bit earlier!\u201d Su Meiyao helped him wipe off a bit of sweat before returning to the ring.However, Chen Xiang did not eat it immediately, but instead took a short break. Afterwards, he called Su Meiyao out and requested to learn the refinement process for both the Transforming Essence Dan and the Cultivating Qi Dan. Seeing such a pa.s.sionate Chen Xiang, Su Meiyao gave in and patiently guided him.The Transforming Essence Dan was arguably the hardest to refine among High-Grade Mortal Level Dans. The herbs were also the most expensive, so it was also the most expensive dan to refine. This was because it can quickly boost divine sense growth. It was important to know that divine sense was incomparably harder to cultivate than True Qi. Also, many powerful exercises need a certain level of divine sense as part of their basic requirements!But even when he was refining the difficult Transforming Essence Dan, Chen Xiang only failed his first attempt before successfully refining it, additionally, he also produced six dans at once! This made even the two beauties, Bai Youyou\u2019s and Su Meiyao\u2019s, pretty faces turn pale. But they were also very excited as they were sure that in the future, Chen Xiang would become an alchemy genius and would definitely reach the apex in alchemy!There were four sets of Transforming Essence Dan materials, because Chen Xiang only failed once, he managed to get a total of eighteen dans. In accordance with each dan, the price was 10,000 spirit coins, which in total, was 180,000 spirit coins! Each set of herbs only costed 15,000 spirit coins and he was able to refine six dans with one set. Chen Xiang was definitely blessed with fortune, however, he was not going to make that fortune in the regular world, but rather in the cultivator\u2019s world!\"Brat, you're quite relaxed now huh? We are waiting for you to successfully refine Spirit Level Dans, don\u2019t complain to high heavens!\" Su Meiyao said. She was shocked and happy for Chen Xiang's alchemy talent but she didn't want him to be overly proud because of this success.Chen Xiang nodded his head in response. In the evening, Chen Xiang ate the dans and went outside the city to cultivate. He was not only cultivating True Qi, but also using various methods to refine his internal and external body. This would not only make his body even more powerful but also allow him to quickly transform True Qi into spiritual power, with which he could then cultivate into divine sense.One month past as Chen Xiang became familiar with the refining process of all three of the most useful High-Grade Mortal Level Dans. He also tried to refine some of the less famous dans in order to improve his alchemy techniques. Of course, to not become overly reliant, he also used other alchemical furnaces for refining. With only small failures at the start before managing to be successful in refinement with other furnaces, it just took a longer.For example, the Grand Elemental Dan only took half an hour to successfully refine in the Flame Dragon\u2019s Brilliant Furnace took about a day in an ordinary alchemical furnace!In just one month, the Chen Family\u2019s position in King City had also stabilized. Their dan business expanded, although the dans they sold were cheap, the quant.i.ty sold were extremely vast, so the Chen Family earned a lot of revenue.In the morning, Chen Xiang returned to the Chen Family Palace from the outside city. After just coming out from the bath, he saw Steward Lao Ma anxiously rus.h.i.+ng over.\u201cYoung Master! Something major has happened!\u201d Lao Ma hastily shouted.\"What happened? Speak.\" Chen Xiang quickly asked.\u201cTen days ago, the Patriarch went out to solve some issues but came back poisoned. Right now, several elders along with Meng Lao are using their True Qi to suppress the toxin. The Patriarch's life is in danger!\u201d The instant Lao Ma finished his last sentence, Chen Xiang turned into a blur and left.Chen Xiang\u2019s complexion was dignified as he came into the private room. Several Elders and Meng Bo were pressing their hands against Chen Tianhu\u2019s upper body while administering their True Qi to suppress the poison in his body.Chen Tianhu\u2019s entire strong and muscular body was pitch black. His face seemed devoid of blood and there were faint traces of Black Qi showing that he was poisoned.Nearby, Chen Luzhong\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he looked at a very small needle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 -Jiudu GangAt this time, several elders and Meng Bo, their complexions were somewhat haggard, all of them were sweating profusely. From their appearance, one could clearly see that they had consumed a lot of their True Qi.\u201cMany thanks seniors, for helping my dad in expelling the poison! How is he now?\u201d Asked Chen Xiang. Although his voice was calm, he was extremely worried in his mind. Chen Tianhu was Chen Xiang\u2019s father and his only family. Since his childhood, his father had taken care of him, which made him afraid at the thought of losing his father.Meng Bo said, \u201cRest a.s.sured, the poison has been temporarily suppressed, but it has not been completely expelled. The poison has completely seeped into the bones and meridians, even entered into his Five Zhang and Six Fu. Fortunately, we were able to suppress the poison, or else\u2026.\u201dChen Xiang closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he then clinched both his fists, in his heart, he was completely furious. An invisible yet heavy Slaughter Qi suddenly surged out from his body.Chen Tianhu slightly opened his eyes, although his voice was very frail, it was full of anger, \u201cJiudu Gang... those b.a.s.t.a.r.ds! They plotted against our Chen family members multiple times, so I personally went to settle all accounts. In the end, a fight broke out. After I managed to kill two managers of Jiudu Gang and five of their elders, their chief plotted against me! I decided to not continue fighting and rushed back!\u201dChen Xiang was shocked, even those elders and Meng Bo glanced at Chen Tianhu with an unbelievable look.\u201cDad\u2026you really rushed alone into Jiudu Gang!?\u201d Chen Xiang sucked a cold long deep breath. The Jiudu gang was a very vicious organization, specializing in poison. Many martial artists feared this dark organization. Ten years ago, two families sent their top experts to deal with them, but not a single one returned.Later, the two Family Patriarchs also went, but they too also didn\u2019t return.\u201cHumph, What is there to fear? Ever since our Chen Family annexed the Yao family, the Jiudu gang has been opposing our Chen Family! Always s.n.a.t.c.hing our goods, even ten of our Chen family members were secretly poisoned. If Jiudu Gang is not eliminated, they\u2019ll only kill more of our Chen Family members.\u201d Chen Tianhu angrily said.\u201cCalm down.\u201d Meng Bo appealed.What Chen Tianhu did, could actually be considered earth shattering. Killing two managers and five elders of Jiudu Gang, was definitely a great loss for them. He had shaken the whole foundation of the gang by himself!Chen Luzhong arrived, and he gave everyone the needle wrapped in a thick cloth he held in his hand for everyone to look at, and said, \u201cThis needle was removed from Tianhu\u2019s arm was responsible for poison we just suppressed a moment ago. Anybody p.r.i.c.ked by this needle will experience a paralysis, which is rather hard to detect. However, as Chen Tianhu\u2019s divine sense is quite powerful, he was able to sense his body condition and didn\u2019t continued the battle. Otherwise, the poison diffusion would have intensified.\u201dSeeing the needle, Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes fiercely opened, his complexion turned more solemn!\u201cI\u2019ve seen this needle before!\u201d Chen Xiang clenched his fists. He remembered when he fought against Crown Prince Song Nanming, he had also used a similar needle. Moreover, Leng Youlan was also stabbed by it, but the poison on it was not this strong.\u201cYes, the Crown Prince, during the battle with Leng Youlan released ice needles and poisoned Leng Youlan! During the match with me, he released similar needles but it was burned down by my fire.\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he spoke.He was constantly pondering about how the Crown Prince obtained this sort of thing, but now that the Jiudu Gang was revealed to also have the same thing, everyone could not help but think there was definitely some a.s.sociation between the two.\u201cThe Emperor, Song Wu, is leisurely and carefree. Joining hands with Jiudu Gang doesn\u2019t have even the tiniest bit of advantage for him, but it is quite possible that the Crown Prince is secretly in contact with Jiudu Gang.\u201d Said Meng Bo, not so long ago it was him who drove out the poison from Leng Youlan, so he was also suspicious.\u201cI must clearly check! Dad, where is the Jiudu Gang\u2019s base?\u201d Chen Xiang asked, his eyes were filled with a thick killing intent.\u201cFreewind Mountain, be careful!\u201d Chen Tianhu was very clear on his son\u2019s, Chen Xiang\u2019s, strength also rea.s.sured him, as even the powerful Yao Family was defeated by him.\u201cRest a.s.sured, we only need some more time to completely expel Tianhu\u2019s poison.\u201d Chen Luzhong patted Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulder.Chen Xiang left the private room, and rode out of the city toward eastern part of King City. Freewind Mountain had always been the gathering place for bandits, and rumour had it that various scattered groups of bandits and robbers had gathered and formed one gang, which was now known as the Jiudu Gang.After leaving the city, Chen Xiang found out that someone was following him. He pretended that he hadn't noticed, and continued on his way. After eliminating the Yao Family, it was quite possible that some of their remnants were looking for revenge. However, with his current strength, Chen Xiang didn\u2019t need to worry about revenge from these sorts of people .Entering the forest ,Chen Xiang got off the horse, and bolted into the forest. He also intentionally slowed down a bit, so that those following him might be able to catch up. However, what made him think something strange was going on was the fact that the person following him didn\u2019t take any actions and seemed to only be responsible for monitoring him.\u201cCould it be someone from Freewind Mountain guessed that I\u2019ll arrive?\u201d Suddenly, this thought sprung up in Chen Xiang\u2019s mind, he speculated there might be an ambush ahead.After entering deep into the forest, he suddenly found out that the one who was following him went around him and was now in front. This made Chen Xiang even more certain about an ambush ahead.Sure enough, after running for a bit into the forest, he saw a man sitting in front him!Not a single tree was planted nearby, and the s.p.a.cious ground was littered with fallen leaves! However, there was a luxurious chair was placed, on which sat a handsome fellow.\u201cSong Nanming!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly looked at the Crown Prince, who was once crippled by Chen Xiang. If not for a large number of good spirit herbs, the Crown Prince wouldn\u2019t have been able to recover so fast.Song Nanming appearing here only had one explanation, and that was Song Nanming and Jiudu Gang did indeed have a close relations.h.i.+p. Just after Chen Tianhu left Jiudu Gang, they had immediately sent a messaging eagle, so Song Nanming had time to come here.According to Chen Xiang\u2019s demeanour, after the poisoned Chen Tianhu fled, Chen Xiang would surely come for revenge. Because Song Nanming hated Chen Xiang, intercepting him halfway was also normal.Once Chen Xiang thought about this, he knew he had been surrounded by many Jiudu Gang members who were prepared to use many hidden weapons laced with poison, however, he was still calm.As an alchemist, he already had the ability to negate poison. Furthermore, he was in the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, so he had strong insight. Lastly, Song Nanming would not use the very same needle to plot against him.Behind Song Nanming stood four robust man, their whole bodies exuding pure True Qi. From this, one could determine they were the Imperial Palace experts.\u201cSong Nanming, I didn\u2019t expect you to team up with the Jiudu Gang! For the dignified Southern Martial Empire Crown Prince to actually have relations with this wicked force, if this is spread out, humph!\u201d Chen Xiang sneered.\u201cChen Xiang, your death is imminent , yet why are you so spirited? You\u2019ll die, and then who will know about me and Jiudu Gang? Hahahaha\u2026as long as I deal with you, when I become Emperor, I will definitely destroy your Chen Family! This is because I want to become the one true Emperor!\u201d Song Nanming said with a maddening look.The Southern Martial Empire\u2019s Emperor was an Emperor in name only, although he managed the whole country, when the Chen and Yao Family matter occurred, he had no right to interfere, nor did had he the strength to do so. Therefore his authority was actually very limited.Song Nanming was the Crown Prince, the next Emperor. With his extreme desire for power, he didn\u2019t want to supressed by those martial arts families, so he had form relations with Jiudu Gang like forces. When the time was right, he planned to use these forces to secretly annihilate these families.\u201cAttack, we cannot allow him to make it alive out of here.\u201d With Song Nanming yelling, a cold wind suddenly blew in the forest!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Exterminating Dragon Divine Martial SkillSong Nanming, who was being escorted by the four Imperial Palace Experts behind him, vanished in the blink of an eye inside the forest.A chilly wind came, and Chen Xiang saw large amounts of black mist suddenly appear around him. He immediately guarded his body with vibrant True Qi, transforming it into a Qi cover enveloping his body. He held his breath at the same time, because he knew that this was definitely a poisonous mist.The poisonous mist had just arrived, enshrouding the place where Chen Xiang stood, covering him completely. Even under the broad daylight, it was pitch black around him. Suddenly, Chen Xiang\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he sensed numerous things quickly flying towards him from all four directions.Those were countless arrows as well as needles of varying length and thickness\u2026A variety of hidden weapons simultaneously flew over from all four directions. The previously dusky forest was now tightly covered and became even darker. This was similar to a rainstorm of poisonous hidden weapons that were currently flying towards Chen Xiang.Previously, Chen Xiang had perceived many people around him, but he hadn\u2019t expected them to simultaneously release this many hidden weapons in such a spectacular way! However, despite this being the case, Chen Xiang was still not the least bit afraid!\u201cNo wonder Song Nanming is so certain of my death. If I was an ordinary 8th level or 9th level Mortal Martial Realm Expert, I\u2019m afraid I would surely suffer!\u201d Chen Xiang said in his heart. As the countless flying needles and arrows stabbed him, a large amount of invisible True Qi immediately burst out from his body.This was the Universal Force created from the fusion of the five elements. This deep and terrifying power pervaded through a radius of several zhang. Those flying hidden weapons were now caught by this power, none of them were able to move an inch forward, entirely suspended in the air.Countless flying needles and arrows were stopped by the Universal Force released by Chen Xiang. They were suspended in the air and pilled up of top of each other. It was as if a black wall was erected all around Chen Xiang.\u201cHei Hei, no more huh! But this could still be counted as enough!\u201d Chen Xiang laughed. He used [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] with both hard and soft characteristics, and released the Universal Force that held all of the hidden weapons suspended in place within the air.At this time, Chen Xiang sensed that all the hidden people around him started to run away into the forest. A ruthless idea came to Chen Xiang... BOOM! The Universal True Qi surged out like tsunami from his body. Due to the sudden force, those hidden weapons, which were previously suspended in air, got blasted away along with the poisonous mist and flew out in all four directions.In the blink of an eye, Chen Xiang\u2019s location was now restored to the previous luminous forest. However, now there were waves after waves of pitiful screams emitted from the forest as if a devil was demanding for hundreds of lives.\u201cTruly reaping what you sowed!\u201d Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed. He had extremely vibrant and powerful True Qi, as long as he could use it\u2019s power properly, nothing was impossible for him. He simply didn\u2019t need to pay any attention to hidden weapons.Two group of flames appeared on Chen Xiang\u2019s back, these intense flames soon transformed into a pair of giant wings!In order to prevent Song Nanming from escaping, Chen Xiang had used the [Vermillion Bird Fire Wings]. These fire wings instantly pushed Chen Xiang upwards, like an eagle soaring in the sky.Chen Xiang\u2019s vision was like an eagle, even while flying high in the air, he could still clearly see everything on the ground. He soon was able to reach the road outside the forest where he previously left his horse, which was also the path back to the King City.Chen Xiang, with his divine sense, flapped and controlled the [Vermillion Bird Fire-Wings] and flew extremely quickly. It didn\u2019t take long for him to catch up with Song Nanming!Galloping on the horseback and speeding away, Song Nanming looked very excited because he finally was able to remove his greatest enemy. As long as his father, the Emperor, pa.s.sed his throne to Song Nanming, he could carry out his plan. But at this time, he suddenly heard someone calling out his name!\u201cSong Nanming!\u201d Chen Xiang shouted while up in air, .Song Nanming thought he heard it wrong, but he once again heard a clear sound coming from high above. He, along with the four Imperial Palace Experts, raised their heads and looked up, they immediately saw a pair of fiery red wings appear up in the sky. Those pair of wings were extending from a person\u2019s body, and that person was Chen Xiang.Watching the wings formed from True Qi behind Chen Xiang, a s.h.i.+ver suddenly ran down along Song Nanming\u2019s entire body, from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. Chen Xiang was still alive! Moreover, he was using a priceless True Qi wing martial skill!Chen Xiang dived down from the sky, a large amount of terrifying azure True Qi suddenly appeared on his palm. Soon, a giant palm from True Qi was formed. Although Song Nanming and others were running, they were nothing more than rabbits struggling in a falcon\u2019s grip.Chen Xiang released the giant palm and fiercely struck down, pressing down on Song Nanming and all of the Imperial Palace Experts. This was the True Qi from someone in the 8th level Mortal Martial Realm, and it also contained azure lightning and aura wind. Under its terrifying power and momentum, Song Nanming and the others were seriously injured in blink of an eye. Man and horse were both pressed against the ground, the horses were instantly killed, while their riders were vomiting blood, struggling on the ground.Chen Xiang arrived next to them while holding a long blade. Right in front of Song Nanming, Chen Xiang began beheading those Imperial Palace Experts one by one. Watching this horrific scene unfold in front of him, Song Nanming trembled from fear and even wet his pants.Chen Xiang could kill Song Nanming unscrupulously, and he knew it. Death was right around the corner, and the air was filled with the strong stench of blood. Four heads were placed in front of Song Nanming, but in spite of the gory sight in front of him, what made him more frightened was that smile on Chen Xiang\u2019s face combined with the thick Slaughter Qi emanating from his body.\u201cI didn\u2019t even intend to pursue the matter from the previous Martial Art Tournament, but I also did not think you would plot to kill me! This is what you asked for!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly said.Song Nanming\u2019s handsome face was twisted. He was seriously injured and didn\u2019t have an ounce of strength to resist, but he still said with difficulty, \u201cYoung Master Chen, I\u2026\u201dBefore he even finished his sentence, Chen Xiang\u2019s blade fell, separating Song Nanming\u2019s head from his body. The Crown Prince had just been beheaded by Chen Xiang!\u201cPresumptuous guy, always making other people waste their energy!\u201d Chen Xiang said with disdain. He took Song Nanming\u2019s storage pouch and looked inside. In additions to tens of thousands of spirit coins, there was also a brand-new book.Chen Xiang quickly took out the book and opened it. When he saw the words, (\u9f99\u6b66), [Dragon Martial Technique], he was immediately delighted in his heart. He did not think that Song Nanming would actually carry around the [Dragon Martial Technique]!Chen Xiang quickly put the [Dragon Martial Technique] inside the invisible ring so that Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou could study it.The ancient [Dragon Martial Technique] could be considered a type of divine exercise. It was so powerful that even Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were very interested in it.\u201cIt\u2019s just a part of the complete [Dragon Martial Technique]. It\u2019s main portion is to guide the user in how to transform their True Qi transforming into Dragon\u2019s Aura. Afterwards, with this Dragon Aura the user can cast out martial skills, it was exactly the same as the Dragon Aura Fist that you used before, that so called [Dragon Aura Fist] you previously stole from and used against Song Nanming was actually still not quite perfect. Furthermore, it could also be said that Song Nanming had not practised enough and was not proficient in this skill!\u201d Su Meiyao said excitedly.\u201cThere\u2019s such a good martial skill and yet he didn\u2019t practice enough. This Crown Price is simply a waste.\u201d Those ice cold eyes of Bai Youyou was calmly staring at that book. Although it was handwritten, it was very detailed.Chen Xiang was already missing some suitable martial techniques, as there weren\u2019t many inside the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols]. Furthermore, the few in there often required extremely vibrant True Qi to properly display their effects. Although the Chen Family may have a few decent martial techniques, Chen Xiang was not satisfied with them. Besides, the majority were not suited for his cultivation.\u201cSister Meiyao, is there any difference between the [Dragon Martial Technique] and the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise]?\u201d Chen Xiang asked.\u201cThey are completely different! The [Dragon Martial Technique] was personally created by a dragon! Meanwhile, the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] was created by a human in accordance with a dragon. According to ancient legends, it has been mentioned that the [Dragon Martial Technique] created by a dragon can fully display a dragon\u2019s formidable power, even to the point where it is capable of killing other dragons! As such, it is also known as the [Exterminating Dragon Divine Martial Skill].\u201d Su Meiyao said.[Exterminating Dragon Divine Martial Skill]! Just from the name itself, Chen Xiang knew it was very formidable.\u201cSo, the fragments of the [Dragon Martial Technique] should be scattered throughout the world, but if all of them were to be collected, that would mean that\u2026\u201d As Chen Xiang thought about this, he suddenly became very excited. However, he knew in his heart this would be very difficult to achieve.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Martial SpiritTranslated by: AshEdited By: iballisticbunny, TheNo1FanChen Xiang set fire to Song Nanming and the others to incinerate their bodies. But what made him surprised was that although the fire reduced them to ash, two Chi long golden bands of light remained.[TLN: 1 Chi= \u2153 m]\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Chen Xiang said, with uncertainty, and then consulted Bao Youyou and Su Meiyao.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, who were both wearing a black hood, came out of the storage ring. They wore these outfits so no one would be able to see their appearances.\u201dIt is a Martial Spirit?\u201d In Bai Youyou\u2019s ice cold voice, a sliver of surprise could be heard.Su Meiyao leaned down and stroked it with her head, saying with certainty: \u201cYes, they are Martial Spirits!\u201d\u201cWhat is a Martial Spirit? Chen Xiang had never heard of such a thing.\u201cThis thing has a unique property, what it is specifically is unclear. Anyway, it is bred out from True Qi, produced by heaven and earth. If it is an ice martial spirit and fuses with your arm, even fire attributed True Qi, after pa.s.sing through the ice martial spirit, will become ice cold True Qi.\u201d said Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang was surprised \u201cSo you\u2019re saying if someone who cannot release fire True Qi integrates a fire Marital Spirit into their arm, then they could very well be able to release fire True Qi?\u201dBai Youyou said \u201cYes. So any Martial Spirit is very valuable and it is also why we cannot tell what attribute this Martial Spirit has.\u201dChen Xiang just heard about this mystical resource for the first time, which shows just how rare it was. But then why would Song Nanming have it?\u201cHaving a Martial Spirit might not make much sense to you because you are able to freely release the five elements of True Qi, but you should keep it to sell later. You should be able to exchange it for a lot of good resources.\u201d Su Meiyao got out a small jade bottle and using the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] sucked in the Martial Spirit.Chen Xiang flew up towards Freewind Mountain. Killing Song Nanming not only gave him the [Exterminating Dragon Divine Exercise] but also the Martial Spirits. This harvest can be considered to be very big.Using his divine sense Chen Xiang asked Su Meiyao who was inside the ring \u201cSister Meiyao, can you talk about these martial spirit things with me? Is it really irrelevant and useless for me?\u201dSu Meiyao said \u201cOf course not, there are many different types of martial spirits. In addition to the primary elemental martial spirits, there are also beast martial spirits that have been congealed out by demon beasts, which is equally rare. The kind which is most useful to you would be a fire martial spirit! It is able to change the very nature of the flames, allowing them to have a wide variety of properties which is very helpful to alchemists.\u201cFire spirits are very rare. I only know that my teacher has one and has never seen anyone else have it, but only heard rumors that several strong individuals have one.\u201dChen Xiang is secretly shocked. He heard from Su Meiyao\u2019s mouth that people who have this fire Martial Spirit are one of those extremely strong experts!Freewind Mountain, although not very high, is still a very big stone mountain. At the highest point, many houses are constructed, and above the hilltop there was a majestic palace hall. Chen Xiang did not expect that in such a place there will actually be a gathering of the black forces at such a large scale.Chen Xiang admired his father, who with only the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, actually dared to solo rush into the large dark forces and also killed a lot of their important members.At the foot of the mountain, due to the pervious rush by Chen Tianhu, many people are patrolling. This Freewind Mountain is way more heavily guarded, but that doesn\u2019t matter to Chen Xiang. His father had previously beheaded many high-level members, so he was much more relaxed.Chen Xiang already knew that the Jiudu Gang is very formidable and that they used all kinds of hidden weapons laced with poison. As long as he took the proper precautions against them, he simply had nothing to fear from this Jiudu Gang.Before, Chen Xiang was attacked from all sides by thousands of hidden weapons. Yet all of them didn\u2019t even matter to him, those hidden weapons are not even slightly effective against him.One Jiudu Gang member saw Chen Xiang coming out from inside the mountain forest. He immediately unsheathed the sword on his waist, shouting \u201cWho is it!?\u201d\u201cChen Xiang!\u201dWhen the Jiudu Gang members saw this handsome teenager burst out a mesmerizing Slaughter Qi while he spoke, they could not help but be alarmed. They had no doubt that this teenage is the rumoured Chen Xiang![EDN:No s.h.i.+t sherlock, he just shouted out his name.]Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes, containing immense amounts of Slaughter Qi, swept through the group. Suddenly those Jiudu Gang Members waved both of their arms quickly as numerous steel needles of varying sizes flew out from their hands. Under the illumination of the sunlight, they all flashed with an intermittent cold aura.Just as Chen Xiang expected, most of the Jiudu Gang members used hidden weapons. If it was any ordinary martial artist, they would have difficulty guarding against these attacks and would be easily killed by these people.But for Chen Xiang, this simply did not pose that much of a threat. His eyebrows just simply rose while hot aura Qi surged out from his body, forming a s.h.i.+eld that wrapped around his body. These steel needles were stopped in their tracks by the s.h.i.+eld.Chen Xiang, watching the sharp steel needles, coldly smiled and emitted a powerful divine sense. This in turn, controlled those countless steel needles, making them turn around right back onto those Jiudu Gang members.\u201cCreating all these steel needles shouldn\u2019t be that easy right? Here, I\u2019ll return them all back to you!\u201d Chen Xiang sneered as the countless steel needles fell like a rainstorm towards the Jiudu Gang members.The Jiudu Gang members who weren\u2019t able to react properly in time, easily got pierced by the countless different steel needles, resembling a human hedgehog.Afterwards, Chen Xiang saw a scalp-tingling scene. Not far from him, those 40 to 50 people, after being pierced by their steel needles, suddenly turned black. These people emitted the most miserable screams as their bodies slowly melted turning into a black pool of blood.This blood is full of poison as not just their bodies but even their clothes weren\u2019t spared as they melted. Slowly the stones besides them and even those steel needles disappeared, showing just how terrible this poision is.\u201cThis Jiudu Gang cannot be allowed to remain!\u201d Chen Xiang said with a frown. He released a large amount of flames incinerating the poison blood, then started flying towards the hilltop.Just a moment ago, when Chen Xiang and the Jiudu Gang members acted, the intermittent rings of bells came from the hilltop. Chen Xiang knew he has been discovered, but he still ran towards the hilltop.Arriving at the top of the hill, surprisingly, there was no one there. When he entered the majestic palace hall, he saw a person covered in a full black robe inside the luxurious large hall. But suddenly behind this figure, appeared a large crowd that surrounded him. Their numbers could only be counted in the thousands.\u201cIs your father dead!?\u201d One white haired, dwarf, ugly old man came out, in a very ugly voice asked.[TLN: What the h.e.l.l everything about him is ugly. LOL:)]\u201cNope, alive and well!\u201d Chen Xiang calmly replied, which made the ugly dwarf old man\u2019s eye fiercely shoot open. Chen Xiang determined this old man should be the Jiudu Gang Chief.\u201cHumph, in that case, why did you come here to die?\u201d The Jiudu Gang Chief coldly said. When he looked at Chen xiang, there was an expression in his eyes that seemed to be looking at a dead man.\u201cI did not come here to die. I came here to collect your life.\u201d Chen Xiang solemnly stated, his face and tone were completely serious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Jiu DuzhiTranslated by: AshEdited by:TheNo1Fan and inallisticbunnyListening to this, the Jiudu Gang leader, as if listening to a joke actually laughed. Following right after him, all the black robed men around him also started laughing. Their laughter was very ugly, and absolutely terrifying.\u201cYour father came quietly, which is why it cost us dearly. If we had taken early precautions then he would have died, but now in your case we have taken these necessary measures. There is no doubt that you will certainly die.\u201d Jiudu Gang leader said with a sinister laughter.\u201cYou are able to come here then you should have not encountered Song Nanming, it\u2019s your good luck But you coming here is also the same as death! Of course, I\u2019ll will not let you die so easily, I\u2019ll use poison to slowly kill you, and even use you to threaten the Chen family\u2026\u201dChen Xiang interrupted him and said \u201cI met Song Nanming and this also means that I also experienced your proud Jiudu Gang, but it seems that they are not very formidable.\u201dChen Xiang words made the triumphant Jiudu Gang leader\u2019s complexion suddenly sink, and with an unbelievable look on his face said, \u201cBrat, I know you\u2019re formidable, but the fact that you\u2019re still not dead under the siege of hundreds of groups of the Jiudu Gang would mean that you would have to be in the tenth level of Mortal Martial Realm!?\u201d\u201cI admit, your embroidery needle technique is not bad, pretty dangerous, but in my eyes they are only the acrobatics of a child!\u201d Said Chen Xiang, who was originally was smiling, but suddenly his smile disappeared and his face turned into a face that was full of slaughter Qi: \u201cI\u2019m not in the tenth level of Mortal Martial Realm but I\u2019m able to kill a tenth level Mortal Martial Realm expert!\u201dImmediately after speaking, in Chen Xiang\u2019s one arm suddenly surged out an invisible Qi aura, which was congealed out from Universal True Qi, if their divine sense was not strong enough then they simply couldn\u2019t find this frightening True Qi.When the Jiudu Gang members had just discovered Chen Xiang action, Chen Xiang\u2019s fist already fiercely struck out, and rushed forward. Because the speed was too fast, a majestic force struck from the air above, emitting a deafening explosion, and the whole ground broke as it was unable to bear this strong force and the spreading of the Qi undulation which shook and smashed everything it past, this made the entire palace hall to fiercely shake.Chen Xiang\u2019s punch, in blink of an eye, burst out and also accurately struck on top of that old man chest, but what made Chen Xiang surprised is the fact that the Jiudu Gang leader actually did not fly out, and instead, in that moment, the Jiudu Gang leader released a Qi aura and withstood that fierce power of Chen Xiang\u2019s.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiudu Gang leader hadn\u2019t antic.i.p.ated that Chen Xiang would act so suddenly and with this much frightening power. In his own opinion, this power was comparable with several tenth level Mortal Martial Realm experts. He vomited a mouthful of blood, as Chen Xiang\u2019s fist had seriously injured him.\u201cAttack, kill him.\u201dAs the voice faded, Chen Xiang\u2019s fist suddenly turning golden, and glowing True Qi flowed in the veins inside. The place that his feet landed on was smashed, as the extremely powerful True Qi madly surged out from his body, Chen Xiang punch out a fist once again.[Dragon Aura Fist]. This is an [Dragon Slayer Divine Martial Skill], and its power can only be imagined, not to mention the fact that it was formed by using Universal True Qi.\u201cStop, I\u2019m from the Hundred Poison Sect\u2026\u201d He hadn\u2019t even finished speaking, and yet Chen Xiang\u2019s fist, which was like a ball of golden aura, thunderously struck on the Jiudu Gang leader\u2019s head, violently flying and hitting him.True Qi containing extremely, strong destructive power struck on that head, and the head, together with the upper body was blown into pieces of meat in the blink of an eye, at the same time, countless flying needles flew towards Chen Xiang\u2019s body.Chen Xiang did not deal those hidden needles at first, as he knew that all of the hidden weapons were pushed through by pouring True Qi in them, and as long as it was only this strong, he could accurately deal with them.Either directly using powerful True Qi to burst open them, or by controlling them was the only way to deal with these hidden weapons.Chen Xiang had a strong divine sense which he soon released, and those countless flying steel needles coming from all around became perfectly distinguishable for him, because in his eyes those steel needles all became slower.This time, Chen Xiang unlike before didn\u2019t use any True Qi to resist these steel needles, but with his divine sense directly manipulated these poisonous needles, and stopped those needles and suspended them entirely in the air.\u201cHumph, you only have this same attack pattern?\u201d Chen Xiang coldly spoke, and from his body surged out a horrifying scorching Qi. He used this scorching Qi and billows of flame to start burning everything all around him, and in blink of an eye all those steel needles burned down entirely.Those Jiudu Gang members were all shocked, as they thought their hidden weapons were very powerful, unexpectedly so was the Chen Xiang. During their preparation in attempts to launch a second wave of hidden weapons, Chen Xiang had suddenly disappeared in the fire sea inside.As they raised their head to look up in the air, there was a huge burning palm, spraying a hot Qi undulation, as if a big mountain was pressuring down on them!BOOM BOOM BOOM\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The huge burning palm pressed down, producing violent and thunderous explosions, and pressing hundreds of group of gangs in the great hall, and turning them into meat patties followed by a flame incineration.Chen Xiang once again entirely released his Zhu Que True Qi and transformed it into a huge palm, and inside this large hall the entire Jiudu Gang group was killed by the following explosion!In the eyes of a 10th level Mortal Martial Realm expert, ordinary people are like ants. It also isn\u2019t an exaggeration that a 10th level Mortal Martial Realm\u2019s strength compared with a 8th level Mortal Martial Realm\u2019s strength is extremely strong. Although Chen Xiang is at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm his strength displayed was neck and neck with martial artists of the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and even the 10th level mortal martial realm, the complete state of Mortal Martial Realm.Chen Xiang came out of the hall, arrived outside and again used his terrifying power, capable of smas.h.i.+ng a mountain, and completely destroyed the Freewind Mountain top!Coming down from the Freewind Mountain, Chen Xiang immediately operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and converged his irascible slaughter Qi, otherwise, just after killing a group of people, he looked like a slaughtering human fiendG.o.d.Chen Xiang just came down from the mountain and entered the forest inside, and found one thin middle-aged man was in front of him. This man who had a plain appearance, wearing a clean white robe with a beard on some places on his chin, seemed like an ordinary man.But when Chen Xiang saw this middle-aged man, a sense of dread could not be helped but be born in his heart. This middle-aged man had quietly appeared near him, moreover Chen Xiang wasn\u2019t able to see his strength, and Chen Xiang\u2019s intuition also told him that this middle-aged man was one very dangerous figure.\u201cI did not expect to even find such a genius in this secular world, even to have a True Qi wing type martial skill, and have such an amazing inherent potential for alchemy. Even your strength is enough to be shocking, if you can enter the True Martial Realm, you certainly would be the most promising young man.\u201d Said the middle-aged man, with a deadpan expression, and his voice also didn\u2019t even have an ounce of feelings.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Asked Chen Xiang, looking defensive.That middle-aged man revealed a very stiff smile and said, \u201cMy name is Jiu Duzi, the founder of the Jiudu Gang you just destroyed, yet you say who I am?\u201dChen Xiang was surprised in his mind. He knew this Jiu Duzi was here for a very long time but still didn\u2019t act, and even watched the Jiudu Gang\u2019s destruction which he himself had established.One can clearly understand the goal of this Jiu Duzi from this att.i.tude, he was only waiting for Chen Xiang to consume his True Qi so that he can easily deal with Chen Xiang. As he would rather destroy his own clan, this showed how important he regarded Chen Xiang.\u201c10th level Mortal Martial Realm!\u201d Chen Xiang solemnly said.\u201cGood eyesight.\u201d Jiu Duzi coldly smiled, looking at the burning palace hall on the mountaintop, and said contemptuously, \u201cFor me in this world, I simply do not care about anything related to the Jiudu Gang as I only set it for recreational purposes.\u201d\u201cYou have consumed a lot of True Qi! Rest a.s.sured, I will not kill you, I\u2019ll take you back to Hundred Poison Sect and present you as a gift to the Sect Elder, and they\u2019ll like you very much, but prior to this you must hand some things to me or I\u2019ll let you experience what is called a living death.\u201d After speaking Jiu Duzi face turned completely ruthless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: SurpriseThe other party was at the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, which would be Chen Xiang\u2019s first time facing an expert of this level. Moreover, the expert was a disciple of a Martial Arts Sect. Yet there was not an ounce of fear in his heart, on the contrary he was rather excited because he hadn\u2019t met a decent opponent for quite awhile now.\"What do you want me to do, surrender?\" Chen Xiang asked and, though he looked serious, he still gave off a very calm feeling, which made even Jiu Duzi slightly surprised.\"The Thousand Vein Fruit, the Thousand Year Beast Dan, the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s, your cultivating martial skill, as well as all of your pills\u2026 Give them all to me.\" Jiu Duzi's eyes were filled with greed, because these things, even inside a Martial Arts Sect, were very precious and he believed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get them anytime soon.\"Come and collect it yourself.\" Chen Xiang pursed his lips, as a sliver of a smile could be found on his face and his previously grim face was suddenly full of soaring war intention, as Slaughter Qi valiantly soared from his robust body.Seeing the change in Chen Xiang\u2019s appearance, Jiu Duzi was startled, because, mere moments ago, Chen Xiang had looked like someone whose True Qi was almost depleted!\"Humph, callow brat! A youngling like you dares to try and run rampant in front of me.\" Jiu Duzi waved his hand and a blackish poisonous powder immediately surged out from his sleeve. It transformed into a fierce wind and blew towards Chen Xiang. At such a close range, Chen Xiang was simply unable to react in time and he was, in the blink of an eye, drowned by the billowing black poisonous wind.\"Brat, the Hundred Poison Sect is one of the five Devil Sects and specializes in poisons, they don't have any powerful martial skills. Even though he is in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he cannot even utilize half of the usual strength of a 10th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioner. As long as you can deal with the poison they use on you, it is easy to deal with them.\" In Chen Xiang's mind Bai Youyou's voice appeared.Previously, Chen Xiang had learnt several methods of resisting poison from the two beauties beforehand. At this point, the vibrant wood attribute True Qi wrapped Chen Xiang\u2019s entire body like a coc.o.o.n, however, the poisonous powder was still able to seep in. If his True Qi was not vibrant enough and wasn\u2019t resisting the poisonous air internally and externally, he would\u2019ve been poisoned. This shows how fearsome the Hundred Poison Sect are when using their poisons.Chen Xiang\u2019s body suddenly shook as the poisonous mist shrouding his body was dispersed. It was even blown away towards Jiu Duzi, while at the same time Chen Xiang took one step and arrived in front of Jiu Duzi. He opened his mouth and roared, casting [Azure Dragon Roar] which started spewing Lightning Qi Aura, and accompanied the poisonous mist to attack Jiu Duzi.After he finished casting [Azure Dragon Roar], Chen Xiang then cast [Dragon Aura Fist]. His True Qi transformed into a Dragon Aura. Using this Dragon Aura, he punched out a [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]. After this frightening Dragon Qi Aura was released, it generated fearsome Qi Aura explosions, one after another.Jiu Duzi simply didn't expect Chen Xiang to resist his poison and even more, to counter attack him at lightning speed, furthermore with such a fearsome True Qi. In the blink of an eye, together with his own poisonous mist, dozen or so blows from Cheng Xiang had struck his body. Each fist that was struck on Jiu Duzi's body, produced a fearsome Qi explosion, which made even the ground tremble. Leaves started to fall from the nearby trees due to the aftershock, while Jiu Duzi vomited a mouthful of blood.At any rate, Jiu Duzi was also a 10th level Mortal Martial Realm martial pract.i.tioner. Though he often used poison, his True Qi was still very vibrant, so he still had a certain level control over his True Qi. He was capable of quickly resisting Chen Xiang's violent and fearsome punches with his vibrant True Qi.\"Well brat, I underestimated you! But do not look down on me quite yet!\" While Jiu Duzi spoke, he released dozens of pitch black snickersnees, which pierced through the air and flew towards Chen Xiang.[TLN: Snickersnee: A large sword-like knife.]Chen Xiang quickly moved his True Qi and released an Aura Wall in front of him, blocking the pitch black snickersnees. But a snickersnee is unlike the previous poisonous needles and weren't so easy to deal with. Surprisingly, these snickersnees, that contained poison, slowly penetrated his Aura Wall. Not far away Jiu Duzi was controlling these snickersnees with his divine sense.\"Brat, you're still too tender! Explode!\" Jiu Duzi sneered and at that exact moment the snickersnees exploded. A powerful Qi aura burst out from them, while these snickersnees turned out to be somewhat special. Unexpectedly, compressed Qi Aura could be poured into them, so when they exploded, Chen Xiang's Aura Wall was taken along with them, moreover a black poisonous mist burst out.This Jiu Duzi had endless means and it was virtually impossible to guard against all of them. If it was any other 10th level Mortal Martial Realm expert, they certainly would have been killed.\"The people we both have previously encountered are very different. The people you met, though you can easily defeat them, they're still nothing in my eyes.\" Jiu Duzi gradually walked towards Chen Xiang. The power generated by the explosion of those snickersnees caused Chen Xiang to fly before he was smashed into the ground.Jiu Duzi thought Chen Xiang had been seriously injured and also poisoned. He didn\u2019t expect at all that Chen Xiang would suddenly bounce back from the ground and rush towards him like a bolt of lightning. Chen Xiang's right hand transformed into a dragon claw, this incredibly sharp claw was congealed out by using his Azure Dragon Aura Qi, which was capable of destroying even the strongest of defences.Like a lightning bolt, Chen Xiang suddenly swooped towards him. Jiu Duzi was simply defenseless, all he could do in time, was to mobilize his true Qi to reduce the damage as much as possible. Yet, he still underestimated Chen Xiang\u2019s Azure Dragon Claw, which, to his surprise, directly stabbed into his abdomen!\"[Engulfing Devil Skill]!\" Chen Xiang cried in his heart, operating the frightening devil skill pa.s.sed down by Bai Youyou, engulfing the 10th level Mortal Martial Realm Jiu Duzi's True Qi!Jiu Duzi was greatly shocked in his heart, as he could feel how his vibrant True Qi was rapidly pouring out of his wounds. He could see on Chen Xiang's handsome face that it was now abruptly covered with hideous blue veins, and he could sense that his True Qi was directly pouring into these blue veins.Chen Xiang was engulfing his True Qi. Jiu Duzi panicked, every Devil Sect members aspired for this type of devil skill, but these type of Devil Skills are only owned by devil path sects. However, at this moment, Jiu Duzi was personally experiencing it!\"You!!!\" Jiu Duzi roared, as he took another snickersnee out and madly stabbed it towards Chen Xiang, but Chen Xiang, before he had casted the [Engulfing Devil Technique], had released his strongest Qi Aura defence around his body, because it was harder for him to gather his own True Qi while he was engulfing Jiu Duzi's True Qi, thereby reducing his power greatly.Boundless True Qi madly surged into Chen Xiang's internal body, violently surging into his meridians. This wildly flowing True Qi caused incessant pain in his meridians, but on the other hand Jiu Duzi\u2019s complexion was turning increasingly white, and the strength of his whole body was becoming weaker and weaker. In the blink of an eye more than half of his True Qi was gone!Chen Xiang extracted his right hand from Jiu Duzi's abdomen, while fiercely punching out with his left hand. Tyrannical True Qi surged out and bombarded on Jiu Duzi's body, breaking open his thin and flat body.Jiu Duzi wasn\u2019t dead yet, as that skinny and hideous face of his was filled with fear, anger and despair, all at the same time \"You........ What did you do to me.......... I don\u2019t........ I don\u2019t have my True Qi........That is dozens of years of my cultivation...... Gone......\"\"Go die already!\" Chen Xiang punched out in the air and a tyrannical True Qi transformed into black Qi Aura which struck Jiu Duzi's body. The upper half of his body almost exploded, as it turned into many bits and pieces.Chen Xiang picked up Jiu Duzi's storage pouch and hastily flew away. His body couldn\u2019t withstand the new internal tyrannical True Qi, which was raging inside his meridians and Five Zhang and Six Fu, his face was ashen.\"Brat, I already told you that you should not engulf someone whose strength is much stronger than your own, if you aren't able to control this engulfed power your body will explode and you will perish.\" Bai Youyou coldly shouted, her voice was full of anger but there was a sliver of concern within it.\"Sister Youyou, do not worry, I've a sense of proportion!\" Chen Xiang operated the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], refining as much as possible of the engulfed True Qi, along with swallowing many pills, which could help him in refining the True Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Inheritance BeadBai Youyou was very p.i.s.sed off, but now was not the time to teach him a lesson.\u201cQuickly find a place and carefully refine it!\u201d Bai Youyou instructed, her ice cold voice sounded somewhat anxious, which made Chen Xiang\u2019s heart feel a little warm. He suddenly felt somewhat guilty for not remembering Bai Youyou\u2019s advice, even though she had insisted on it so many times.Chen Xiang went deep into the mountain forest, and prepared to refine the engulfed tyrannical True Qi above a giant tree. This True Qi rejected him after entering his body because this True Qi wasn\u2019t originally his, thus becoming maniacally oppressive, and if it was not suppressed, then it would soon blast him to death.Fortunately the situation itself wasn\u2019t all that bad. Although Jiu Duzi was in 10th level Mortal Martial Realm, his True Qi was not so pure, moreover his True Qi didn\u2019t possess any kind of attribute.The Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram within Chen Xiang quickly started spinning, sucking that muddy True Qi inside the Tai Chi diagram for refinement. Immediately after that, pure white True Qi started to shoot towards the five b.a.l.l.s of different attributed True Qi breeding above the Tai Chi diagram.\u201cMeiyao sister, what do I do next? I feel that these five True Qi b.a.l.l.s aren\u2019t able to a.s.similate that much True Qi in any way possible.\u201d Chen Xiang asked.\u201cCompress them and congeal a form! Congeal five different shapes from these five elements True Qi b.a.l.l.s.\u201d Su Meiyao immediately replied.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, The True Form Realm?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. Compressing the True Qi and congealing out a form was done to enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\u201cNot so fast, since you want to condensate the form from all five True Qi b.a.l.l.s, and you\u2019re also cultivating the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols], then you should congeal the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermillion Bird and the Black Tortoise, these four ent.i.ties!\u201d Su Meiyao instructed.Chen Xiang frowned and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know the true appearance of these four divine beasts, so how am I going to congeal their appearance? Moreover my main cultivation exercise is the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], so shouldn\u2019t my True Form be relevant with my main exercise?\u201d\u201cThe [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] is a branch exercise of the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] have the very same mnemonics for congealing out shapes for entering the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, so if you follow according to my previous mnemonics, naturally, you\u2019ll be able to congeal the four divine beast forms.\u201d Su Meiyao spoke.[TLN:Mnemonics: chanting sutra]After listening to what Su Meiyao said, he immediately thought about the one seemingly common mnemonics of the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] and the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] which he couldn\u2019t completely understand. Su Meiyao once said that this was the most crucial mnemonics, however, she hadn\u2019t told him that this mnemonics was responsible for congealing the True Form.Chen Xiang immediately started operating the exercise according to the mnemonics, letting the True Qi flow into his dantian according to the predescribed method. He first decided to congeal the Azure Dragon beast form, and he started compressing a large amount of True Qi to congeal this form. During this process, a large amount of True Qi was compressed together, and because of this, True Qi continuously exploded. Due to these small explosions there was a qualitative change in his True Qi, making the True Qi much more vibrant and intrepid.An entire day went by, and above the Tai Chi Diagram in Chen Xiang\u2019s dantian there was True Qi, in the form of a snake, dancing. Currently it was only an embryonic form and had not fully taken form yet, so one couldn\u2019t see the minutiae of the Azure Dragon on it yet.\u201cYour True Form has just taken shape, so it\u2019s not the genuine and final form, only after reaching the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, The Complete Realm, will the True Form within your body be lifelike. You must separately compress all five attributed True Qi into a form, and then only can you consider yourself to have advanced into the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!\u201d Su Meiyao continued.Chen Xiang nodded his head and continued to cultivate\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The next morning, warm morning light shone onto the branches and the leaves above Chen Xiang\u2019s body. Chen Xiang gradually opened his eyes and gently sighed, as currently he was only able to congeal two True Qi forms.The Azure Dragon and the Vermillion Bird forms were extremely fuzzy, but they were molded by compressing a large amount of True Qi, so they were much more vibrant than before.Originally the True Qi ball was like a small bead in a very big s.p.a.ce, containing a few hundreds of rice grain sized True Qi inside them, but now that very small bead contained tens of thousands of rice grain sized True Qi in them, but this was just the initial state. If one really wanted to congeal a lifelike True Qi form, then at that time one needed to compress hundreds of thousands of this rice grain sized True Qi in that tiny little s.p.a.ce inside.\u201cOnly two True Qi forms!\u201d Chen Xiang inspected the interior of his dantian and was slightly disappointed, while watching the snake form and the bird form spreading its wings above the Tai Chi diagram.\u201cIt\u2019s enough. That guy\u2019s True Qi had a large amount of impurities, and after refining it and compressing it, not much of it remained.\u201d Su Meiyao spoke.\u201cHumph, next time don\u2019t do it again!\u201d Bai Youyou angry voice sounded out, making Chen Xiang\u2019s whole body tremble.Chen Xiang immediately smiled apologetically and said, \u201cYouyou,sister, I was wrong, there will be no next time.\u201d\u201cI know that you wouldn\u2019t dare do it again\u201d Bai Youyou crooned.Although he hadn\u2019t entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, Chen Xiang still felt that his strength had been enhanced by quite a lot as the small explosions that were generated during the compression of his True Qi had enhanced the quality of his True Qi.Chen Xiang previously could blow up a tree with a rice grain sized True Qi, but now with the very same amount of True Qi he was able to blow up ten trees. This was because a grain of his current True Qi was made by compressing ten grains of the previous True Qi, steeply improving its quality. This was the result of his constant cultivation. This compression of True Qi was simply boundless and the more he wished to exceed the previous quality, the more he must try to compress it even further. But this compression process was very arduous, because it requires the absorption of large amounts of Spirit Qi and converting it into True Qi.Chen Xiang asked, \"Meiyao sister, using the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] I can only congeal four forms, yet I've five elements of True Qi, what form will my Earth True Qi congeal?\"\"In the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] there is a divine elephant! However, when I was congealing its form, I chose to congeal a lotus.\"An Elephant! Chen Xiang felt a burst of joy in his heart, because in his mind, the elephant was the most powerful beast.Chen Xiang was still sitting on the top of the tree, and because Jiudu Gang had been dealt with, this area was now safe. It was at this time that he took out Jiu Duzi's storage pouch, and looked inside to find if there was anything valuable.There were a lot of items inside, however, the majority of these things were similar to the poisonous needle hidden weapon. Poisonous powders, poisonous herbs were also present, and there were some antidotes and dans. There were also some large spirit coins, and all of these things were useful to Chen Xiang, because if he was to encounter any form of danger on the path that was laid ahead of him, these hidden weapons and poisonous herbs could be used to attack others, which made it a pretty good harvest.Chen Xiang also found a square jade box inside the storage pouch. He took the jade box out, but when he tried to open it, he found to his surprise, that he wasn\u2019t able to open it.\"Try using your divine sense. There must be something inside this jade box, and only with a strong divine sense will you be able to open it.\" Su Meiyao spoke, as although she was inside the ring, she was still able to see outside.Chen Xiang immediately poured his divine sense into the jade box, but he was immediately panic-stricken. This jade box was like a bottomless pit, moreover, it was engulfing his divine sense, and even when he wanted to retrieve his divine sense, he found that it took him a lot of effort to do so.After a few seconds, Chen Xiang felt dizzy, but at this time the jade box stopped engulfing his divine sense and automatically opened. Chen Xiang only saw a walnut sized jade pearl inside it, and this jade pearl was also placed upon a yellow divine beast\u2019s skin!At this point, Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao came out from inside the ring and they stood on a thick branch at the giant tree top next to Chen Xiang, intently watching the thing that was in Chen Xiang's hands.\"This is an inheritance bead, as long as your consciousness enters this inheritance bead, you\u2019ll be able to receive the message that is inside.\" said Su Meiyao. She took out the beast skin padding below the inheritance bead, and the beast skin had been folded over many times, so after unfolding it open, it was very large.\"So in other words, this bead contains information that was left behind by other people?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"Right, some sect's deans use this kind of method. A majority of the deans pa.s.s down their martial skills in this way, so this inheritance bead may contain a martial skill or an alchemy experience left behind by others.\" Bai Youyou said.Chen Xiang felt delighted in his heart, as he had not expected that Jiu Duzi would actually possess this kind of a treasure. He immediately poured his consciousness inside the inheritance jade pearl. Immediately after, a large amount of information suddenly surged into his mind, and after reading all of the information in his mind, his face was full of ecstasy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The demand for refiners was much more than the demand for an alchemists, and low level refiners could be found everywhere, but there were only few Grand Refiners, who were capable of refining formidable equipments. These people were like alchemists in reputation.But after Chen Xiang saw that Refiners scroll, he was suddenly very confident that it would allow him to become a formidable refiner. Of course though, he would still have to put more practice into it than alchemy.Su Meiyao took the inheritance bead and after taking a glance, on her face emerge out a charming smile: \"This is a really good thing. There actually is a tutorial for refining brilliant grade weapons. Moreover there are many schematics, so you better try to have a good grasp of it.\"\"Of course.\" Chen Xiang said with a smile, \"What is painted on the beast skin?\"\"It is a map.\" said Su Meiyao, and at the same time she handed over the inheritance bead to Bai Youyou letting Bai Youyou take a look at it.\"What map?\" Chen Xiang quickly asked.\"A map leading to a herbal garden, but to open this herbal garden you need a key, and method to refine this key is inside the inheritance bead.\" Su Meiyao said.Chen Xiang quickly went through all the information that entered his mind inside just a moment ago, and soon found the refining method for the key. The materials required were very easy to find, but the difficult part was engraving the complex Spirit Veins on the key.\"The key is in my hand, it fell off while opening the map.\" Bai Youyou spread her white palm, only to see a small key with the size of a finger, while being covered in golden patterns. Those Spirit Veins were producing bizarre power, and these patterns were created only after numerous years of research by countless refiners.All equipments must have Spirit Veins on them, otherwise it would be just an ordinary grade equipment. Chen Xiang\u2019s Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace had many complex Spirit Veins inside and outside of it, and this was the reason which allowed the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace to have that bizarre power.[Editor\u2019s Note: Flame Dragon Brilliant Furnace changed to Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace. WE\u2019ll change it in the previous chapters as well once we reach them. Sorry for the inconvenience:/]The majority of Spirit Veins are only pa.s.sed down, and as long as the Spirit Veins are precisely carved upon the equipments during its refinement, then it can be considered successful. This is not that difficult and that's also why there are many refiners.\"This thing looks like it is many years old, and if the garden is still there, then maybe there will be a lot of mature spirit herbs.\" Su Meiyao laughed.Chen Xiang nods his head and asked, \"This herbal garden is where?\"\"It's on the way to the Extreme Martial Sect, so it seems you have to leave early for the Extreme Martial Sect. If this herbal garden has a lot of spirit herbs, then you should be able to enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\" said Su Meiyao.Finally going to Extreme Martial Sect!Chen Xiang was slightly excited: \"I'll go back now and settle everything, and bid farewell to my father.\"After returning to the Chen family, Chen Xiang first went to Chen Tianhu, and seeing Chen Xiang returned safely and in one piece, Chen TIanhu let loose a big breath.\u201cGood, you were able to come back.\u201d said Chen Tianhu with face full of affection.\u201cDad, your complexion has recovered a lot, this is a detoxication dan, after you take it, it\u2018ll allow you to recover quickly.\u201d Chen Xiang said with a smile and then threw a bottle to Chen Tianhu. This dan bottle he obtained from Jiu Duzi could detoxify a majority of the poisons.Chen Tianhu did not ask how Chen Xiang dealt with the Jiudu Gang, as he knew that if Chen Xiang could bring back the antidote then the Jiudu Gang was no more. He clearly knew Chen Xiang\u2019s style of doing things.\u201cDad, it\u2019s about time for me to depart.\u201d and although Chen Xiang said this with a face full of smiles, but in his heart he was very sad.Chen Tianhu slightly sighed, and then said with a smile, \u201cYes, you ought to go because there you\u2019ll be able to fully realize your potential, and by allowing our Chen family to have a foothold in the King city, you\u2019ve already contributed too much to the family.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019m leaving!\u201d Chen Xiang stood up, walk towards Chen Tianhu and hugged him.\u201cEn, you\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019m very relieved! Take care!\u201d Chen Tianhu was completely sad. While he patted Chen Xiang\u2019s back, he knew that after Chen Xiang left to go to those Martial Arts sects, it was possible that he would only come back after many years.Chen Xiang gave Chen Tianhu some Mortal Level High Grade dans, then left the Chen family, and rushed straight to the Dan King Hall, after which he bid farewell to Chen Luzhong and Meng Bo, embarking on his way to the Extreme Martial Sect.While parting Chen Xiang felt a little melancholic, but he was also very looking forward to again meeting them in the future, as he believed at that time he, his father and the whole Chen family would have earth shaking changes!Chen Xiang from afar looked at King city, and looking at one of strongest city in the secular world where many strong experts reside, countless emotion surged in his heart, as although there were many experts inside the city, but compared with those Martial Arts Sect, it can be considered as nothing!\u201cXianxian, here I come!\u201d Looking at the distant mountain range stretching ten thousand Li Chen Xiang clenched his fist, and fiercely broke into a gallop.If he wanted to go to the Extreme Martial Sect, then he would have to pa.s.s through the mountain forest frequented by a large amount of demon beasts. It was a long way to go, full of danger, but as long as he safely reached the other side of the forest, he would have reached the place with plenty of Spirit Qi, and that is the location of those Martial Arts Sects.The secular world and the gathering location of all martial arts experts, was separated by a very large mountain range, and any weak person who entered this mountain range will meet their end.\u201cMeiyao sister, how is the research going for that [Dragon Slayer Divine Martial Skill]? Is it any good?\u201d Chen Xiang asked, as he now urgently wanted to learn more powerful martial skills.\u201cRest a.s.sured. Wait for me and senior sister to thoroughly research this book, and at that time we\u2019ll tell you how to learn the previous Dragon Martial Technique again, so do not worry.\u201d Su Meiyao replied.Having these two mysterious beauty as companions, Chen Xiang was very happy, and they were equivalent to his teachers, always patiently guiding him and even helping him conquer the miseries of cultivation.Chen Xiang had already memorized the route to the herbal garden, and after he entered the piece of forest as similar to a big mountain, it was very easy for him to find the starting point of the route, as a seemingly gourd shaped mountain was present in front of him, which was the first route marker.In order to find that herbal garden more quickly, Chen Xiang used [Vermillion Bird Firewings], and he spread his wings and soared high into the sky. The Vermillion Bird Fire True Qi of his has already congealed out a form, and thus after the compression, his True Qi was much more vibrant, so he did not have to worry about his True Qi suddenly running out.In order to not let anyone find him flying in the sky, Chen Xiang entered the layers of clouds, and hid himself inside of it.His speed of flying was too quick, and all of a sudden he entered the depths of that mountain forest. Moreover, this way he could also avoid some of the demon beasts, and although he did not fear the demon beasts, avoiding some of the problems along the way was rather convenient.The location of the herbal garden was very dangerous and also hidden inside the mountain range, located in one of the small valleys inside. Chen Xiang had been rus.h.i.+ng for three days on the road, and only after this period of time did he see that mountain valley, but inside that mountain valley there was nothing.Chen Xiang swooped down from the sky and landed inside the mountain valley, and although this place\u2019s scenery was very beautiful, there were poisonous miasma drifting outside the mountain valley as well there being various poisonous weeds.There was one cave inside the mountain valley, which was indicated on the map, and although Chen Xiang looked around for a bit and then found that cave, this cave was blocked by tall weeds. He took out a long knife and chopped off those weeds, then cautiously entered the cave, taking out a torch for illumination.\u201cThis d.a.m.n place is hidden, if there was no map, it would be really difficult to find.\u201d Chen Xiang muttered, as he could not understand why this herbal garden was inside the cave.After entering the depths of the cave, Chen Xiang was blocked by an iron door, and he tried a bit to open it, but no matter how hard he tried, he was not able to shake that iron door. Also, regardless of how much strength he used to strike that iron door, the cave didn\u2019t even shake a little bit, and if he was attacking an ordinary mountain, it would have collapsed into large pieces long ago.\u201cThis door should be absorbing your power. Honestly, use the key to open it.\u201d said Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang quickly found the keyhole on the door. He inserted the key, turns it, and heard the \u2018Kacha\u2019 sound, as the iron door gradually opened, a dazzling light shone from inside out.With the opening of the iron gate, Chen Xiang was completely shocked by the scenery inside!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/World Defying Dan GodChapter 0072 - Big HarvestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 0072: Big HarvestUnexpectedly inside the iron gate wasn\u2019t a pitch-black mountainside, on the contrary, it was filled with spirit herbs and spirit trees, and this beautiful mountain valley was filled with bright light!Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou quickly came out, and after they saw this, confusion was clearly visible on their faces.\"All the spirit herbs here are more than a thousand years old!\" Su Meiyao said.Thousand Year Ginseng, Thousand Year Spirit Gra.s.s, Thousand Year Profound Spirit Ginseng, Thousand Year Earth Spirit Gra.s.s..................Although some of these spirit herbs were auxiliary in nature, but after all, they were more than a thousand years old, and now many of these looked like a big turnip. Chen Xiang estimated there were a few hundred of these herbs!\"There are almost twenty Metal Spirit Fruits, and 1000 Vein Fruits, and there are also more than a hundred Purple Spirit Fruit.............Fuc*******, this father is not dreaming ah!\" Chen Xiang cried out loud with surprise, and his heart was fiercely beating because he was incessantly excited.Although a Purple Spirit Fruit was not as precious as a Metal Spirit Fruit, but it was still very expensively sold in the market, as it was one of the main herbs in refining a type of spirit pill.\"Humph, why're you so happy with only this small amount? What a b.u.mpkin!\" Bai Yuoyuo coldly said.Chen Xiang curled his lips and said, \"I know that the two sister\u2019s origin is out of the ordinary, and of course in your eyes these things are nothing, but currently for me they are all nothing but treasures.\"\"Quickly help me pick all of these spirit herbs. It should be enough for me to refine Spirit Level Dans.\" Chen Xiang excitedly said. Currently he didn\u2019t know how to refine Spirit Level Dans, and he knew that he would definitely fail many times, but in this herbal garden there were many auxiliary spirit herbs, so they could allow him to save a lot of his expenses.Only someone like Chen Xiang would make the two peerless beauties work in the field which also made Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou secretly despise him.\"I'm not a man, and this beauty is used to pain but not used to the dirty work.\" Although these words were on Su Meiyao's mouth, she still started to pick those spirit herbs which were more than a thousand years old.\"Humph, do not be loquacious.\" Bai Youyou snorted, making Chen Xiang immediately shut up, as he did not dare to offend this frosty beauty.After half a day\u2019s worth of time, the majority of the spirit herbs which were thousands of years old, in this herbal garden, had already been harvested, and stored inside the residence of Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou inside the storage ring.\"There are 120 Purple Spirit Fruits, more than twenty Metal Spirit Fruits and 1000 Vein Fruit, which should be enough for me to refine the Foundation Building Dan!\" A big grin was visible on Chen Xiang's face as the Foundation Building Dan was not only useful for people entering the True Martial Realm, but was even taken by people who had already entered the True Martial Realm as this pill can allow them to raise their power level, so it was a very useful Profound Level Dan![ED: If names for Dans and stuff change please forgive us. The names will also change in previous chapters once we reach them]The High-Grade Spirit Level True Elemental Dan was already considered to be very precious, not to mention the Profound Level Dan which was even a grade above the Spirit Level.However, Chen Xiang was not currently anxious about the issue of whether he was capable of refining it as it would take a long time for him to learn how to refine High Grade Spirit Level Dans, not to mention refining Profound Level Dans.Inside the herb garden, some of the spirit herbs were in their growth period, and all these herbs which were auxiliary in nature, were also several hundred years old. Chen Xiang was in no hurry to pick them, as of now he had hundreds of thousand years old spirit herbs. Moreover all of them were very big.\"There are lot of powerful arrays inside this herbal garden, that can not only allow sunlight to s.h.i.+ne through this thick rock, but can also gather a large amount of Spirit Qi, which allows this herbal garden to breed these spirit herbs. It seems that the man who created it certainly must have left the Mortal Martial World.\" said Su Meiyao while looking at this beautiful mountainside.Leaving the Mortal Martial World meant that they had the power to break through s.p.a.ce! Chen Xiang was also very much secretly yearning for it, but if he wanted to get to that state, he did not know which year or month he would reach such a stage.\"Chen Xiang, here you can be at ease and calmly cultivate, and enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Once you\u2019re done you can again leave for the Extreme Martial Sect.\" said Bai Youyou, looking like a high and might empress while she was wearing a dress s.h.i.+ning with a golden aura, which looked n.o.ble and elegant as the soft sunlight shone upon it.Chen Xiang bought this dress for her. Moreover, she liked to wear it a lot, and now that her and Su Meiyao could wear these beautiful clothes and bathe in sunlight, this made them feel very joyous. However, if it wasn\u2019t as a last resort, then they didn\u2019t want to stay inside that ring.Chen Xiang now needed a ma.s.sive amount of True Qi to congeal out the forms for the other three attributes of True Qi, and it should be known that he engulfed one 10th level Mortal Martial Realm pract.i.tioner, but he was only able to form two of the attributes of his True Qi. One should then consider how much True Qi he needed to transform the other three attributes True Qi into their forms.The Spirit Qi in this herbal garden was very rich, and in addition to that Chen Xiang also had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins. Chen Xiang closed his eyes, and he imagined himself in a Spirit Qi sea that was simply absorbing the Spirit Qi. Even after all this, it would still take quite a long time for him to enter the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Now Chen Xiang knew why the people who entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Ream in the secular world are at an old age. This was because of the severely spa.r.s.e Spirit Qi in the secular world!\"Now you should start learning how to refine a True Qi Dan! During the day time you should refine them while at night, you should eat those dans. At the same time as when you digest its potency, you must also absorb the Spirit Qi.\" said Su Meiyao, who then began pa.s.sing her experience of refining the True Qi Dan to Chen Xiang.The Grand Elemental Dan was a High Grade Mortal Level Dan, which was capable of producing a large amount of True Qi, and thereby improving the speed of cultivation! The True Qi Dan was much better than the Grand Elemental Dan, as it was a Low Grad Spirit Level Dan, and was also one of the most popular dans in Martial Arts Sects.The True Elemental Dan was a High Grade Spirit Level Dan, similarly also capable of producing True Qi, but was a lot more expensive than the True Qi Dan, and ordinary people cannot even afford it.The True Qi Dan required only one main herb, and that was the Purple Spirit Fruit! Currently, Chen Xiang had more than 120 of these, and also had a lots of auxiliary spirit herbs, which generally only needed to be five hundred years old, but if thousand years old auxiliary herbs were used to refine the dan instead, then only a little bit of it would be needed and it would also be very cost-effective.Chen Xiang took a deep breath, and started digesting the alchemy experience pa.s.sed on by Su Meiyao. Afterwards, he began sorting the herbs, separating each set from one another, and from this he would know how many times he had failed since he started.Chen Xiang took out his Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, and Bai Youyou immediately rushed to a distant area, while quietly chatting with Su Meiyao, as their sisterly bond was very good. Although Bai Youyou was cold, she was very good to Chen Xiang and Su Meiyao, but if it was anyone else, she would be disinclined to pay any attention to them, let alone talk to them.Not long after Chen Xiang began, he failed, and purple smoke burst out from the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace. On the 2nd try, he failed once again..............and until the tenth try. Only then had he entered the intermediate alchemical stage, and at this stage he had to bake all the herbs into herbal powder, and started fusing the herbal powder and herbal Spirit Qi. But at this stage, he failed once again!\"G.o.dd.a.m.nit, this Purple Spirit Herb is like one bad apple spoiling the whole bunch. Ah, I always fail, and this Purple Spirit Fruit is the root of my trouble.\" Chen Xiang complainingly cursed.Distant Su Meiyao giggled and said, \"It is inevitable for the high level dan's main and auxiliary herbs to conflict, and the higher level the dan is, the more obvious the conflict is, and the more difficult it is to resolve. This is simply your job to explore.\"Su Meiyao had been extremely proud of her own alchemy talent, but after the appearance of this freak Chen Xiang, she had to bear twice as much, but now seeing the expression of Chen Xiang who was experiencing failure, she was very happy to laugh.Chen Xiang cast aside everything, and looking at that charming Su Meiyao's face br.i.m.m.i.n.g with a happy smile, he secretly cursed in his heart.\"Meiyao Sister, how many times did you fail?\" asked Chen Xiang.\"Are you testing my memory? My memory is very clear, and it was 72 times!\" Su Meiyao said, and although she failed so many times, she was very satisfied with this number. It must be known that other alchemists, if they had not failed more than a hundred times, they were embarra.s.sed to even say they had learned how to refine the True Qi Dan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wait for me and I'll definitely make you unable to laugh.\"He rested for a moment and then continued refining, but this time, he did not use the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, rather he took out the inferior black alchemical furnace of his that was given to him by his father.\"Oh? Using the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace will let you save time, otherwise you will not even be able to finish refinement once in one day.\" said Su Meiyao.\"You do not need to mind my feelings, it does not matter.\" said Bai Youyou, as she thought Chen Xiang was worried that she would not be able to adapt to the exposure of the peculiar breath of the Flame Dragon.From then on Chen Xiang had not paid any attention to the two beauties again, and with complete dedication he started refining the dan.........During the night, a beautiful soft moonlight shone through the special array, penetrating the thick rocks, and s.h.i.+ning on the mountainside in the herbal garden. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were lying on a bed, and the two beauties were cuddling with each other. With even breathing they were already inside their dreamland. It was very rare of them to nap in this situation but as they were very relaxed around Chen Xiang, they could sleep soundly.Chen Xiang was refining dans, and once in awhile he took a peek at the beautiful and attractive sleeping postures of the two beauties. Seeing this his mind was already a mess, and his furnace nearly burst due to this.\"It would be nice, if I was able to sleep in the middle of them!\" Chen Xiang secretly thought this in his heart, and if this idea came to be known by Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, he definitely would\u2019ve been despised by them for a very long time.A day and a night went by, and only then did Chen Xiang enter the last stage of alchemy process, the solidifying dan stage, but in the end he still failed!Among the number of failures, Chen Xiang had learned to be very calm. He had a large amount of herbs, moreover, with only one Thousand Year Purple Spirit Fruit he would be able to refine the True Qi Dan ten times, and he had more than hundred of these, so he didn\u2019t believe he would encounter failure with all of them.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou only entered the ring when they took a bath and changed their clothes. Chen Xiang found out that these two beauties liked to change their clothes several times in a day, and they never wore the same clothes. Moreover they were also happy in showing it to him.Everytime Chen Xiang saw them coming out after changing their clothes, he would offer a few good and remarkable praises, but every praise of his was different every time. This flattering was just a scratch on the surface for him, and always let Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou's hearts be filled with joy.Chen Xiang knew these two Yaoxing(\u5996\u7cbe) had already lived for more than a thousand years, but in the end they were girls, and girls, more than anything, liked to wear beautiful clothes. All day blindly swaying in front of men, but men only liked to watch if they weren't wearing any clothes.\"Youyou sister, Meiyao sister, I'll continue to buy more beautiful clothes even after entering the Martial Arts Sect, and I think those places should have many other styles.\" Chen Xiang said while laughing.\"You brat. you\u2019re quite good at playing gooseberry, and you know the ways to flatter us.\" said Su Meiyao with a gentle laugh.\"Thanks.\" Bai Youyou said in a low voice, and though her voice was still cold, Chen Xiang who listened to it, seemed to find an inexhaustible gentleness.\"Rest a.s.sured, I'll try hard to elevate my strength, and as soon as possible, I\u2019ll help you recover your strength, and eradicate your enemies, so that you can wear the clothes I buy and freely roam in the world!\" Chen Xiang said with earnest look on his face, and this moved the hearts of Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou.They were now seriously injured, and not mentioning the fact that they still had an enemy, even some slightly powerful experts could easily defeat them. Chen Xiang was their only hope and in their eyes Chen Xiang was behaving like a sensible brother so they were very pleased, even though he sometimes saw them with a wicked expression in his eyes........Again a day went by, and Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were fast asleep cuddling together. When the sunlight shone down on them, they opened their pretty eyes, however, they saw Chen Xiang with both his eyes closed, and with serious face, sweating profusely and refining pills, as he was at the most crucial stage.This was Chen Xiang\u2019s 12th try in refining the True Qi Dan, and having this much progress, Su Meiyao thought it was an accident!A moment later, Chen Xiang took a long deep breath and opened his eyes, his whole face br.i.m.m.i.n.g with happiness. He look towards those two beauties sitting on the bed, and laughingly said, \"Two sisters, how about you try the fresh breakfast I just made!\"After speaking, Chen Xiang opened the lid of the black alchemical furnace, and inside there were five True Qi Dans glittering with a purple light, which made Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou endlessly shocked. Their beautiful faces were full of an unbelieving expression, and quickly rushed towards that alchemical furnace and saw the 'Breakfast' inside!Only Chen Xiang, could casually treat these True Qi Dans as breakfast.\"Meiyao sister, I only failed twelve times, but also refined it with an inferior alchemical furnace. It seems that learning to refine pills with the lowest grade alchemical furnace is a lot more subtle Ah............Meiyao sister, this little brother is ashamed, I was not able to reach yours 72 failure mark.\" Chen Xiang grinned, and seeing this Su Meiyao could not wait to knock out those white teeth of his.\"Infuriating little rascal, When I failed 72 times at that time I was praised as a genius by my teacher, but you.........\" Su Meiyao tooted with her little mouth, and though her face was full of hidden bitterness, but in her heart she was very happy.\"Continue to try hard, and now use the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace! It'll allow you to refine a lot more in a shorter amount of time!\" Bai Youyou with her jade like finger picked the True Qi Dan, and put it inside her beautiful little mouth, lightly chewing. This appearance of her\u2019s was truly attractive.On the other hand Su Meiyao was still flighty, and while Bai Youyou was eating, these two beauties were showing the most charming aspect of theirs. Chen Xiang who was watching this was dazed, and in his heart he could not wait to put them in his arms, caressing them nicely.With an inferior alchemical furnace it took him a little more than a day, but using the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace it only took him half an hour to refine it twice, and at the beginning he still failed while using the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, but once he was familiar with the process, thereafter there were no failures.During the day it was Alchemy, and during the night it was cultivation. Chen Xiang was harvesting the True Qi incomparably quickly.Everyday he was able to refine the Low Grade Spirit Level True Qi Dan ten times, with a total of fifty dans. In the evening, after eating the dans, he cultivated and continued to compress a large amount of True Qi that was brought about by the True Qi Dan...........Time flew by so fast, and in blink of an eye three months had past. Although Chen Xiang was repeating the same routine every day, but with the two peerless beauties as his companions, he didn't get bored.Now Chen Xiang had already congealed out four True Qi forms; the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise. These four divine beasts inside his dantian appeared to be fuzzy, and although he had not actually seen these four divine beasts, nevertheless, after cultivating accordingly to those two divine exercises, he was mystically able to mold out the divine beasts forms, which secretly amazed him.Chen Xiang was now 17 year old, and he was now going to impact on the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Only after congealing the last True Qi form, would he be able to successfully advance into this new stage!If Chen Xiang had not cultivated in this special way, he would have already entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, as he had to cultivate several times more when compared to other people!At the center of the Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram within Chen Xiang's dantian, there was a ball full of Earth True Qi, but currently it was absorbing a ma.s.sive amount of pure True Qi, and rapidly growing. Moreover, at the same time it was also being compressed, and gradually a form was appearing out of it. This form was that of an elephant, which suppressed the Yin and Yang diagram at the center!Spirit Qi from all around this mountain valley was madly surging into this mountain valley, and therein madly absorbed by Chen Xiang. That elephant form had slowly been taking shape, and now Chen Xiang, with his huge divine sense, was establis.h.i.+ng contact with these five beast forms, integrating them into one form.\"I\u2019ve succeeded!\" Chen Xiang shouted loudly, and suddenly invisible Qi undulations burst out from his body. This was the Universal True Qi, and whenever he wished, he can arbitrary integrate five elements of True Qi into one body and release the Universal force.Chen Xiang, using the congealed embryonic stage five divine beasts forms, compressed a large amount of True Qi, then once again using the invisible True Qi congealed out Universal True Qi, and destroyed the big door of the 9th level Mortal Martial Realm!Chen Xiang at just seventeen year of age, entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Entrance FeeChen Xiang, as he watched those five divine beast forms be molded out by compressing a large amount of True Qi in his dantian, could not help but sigh because of all of that boundless True Qi. Common 10th level Mortal Martial Realm experts were not his match. As for True Martial Realm martial artists, as he has not seen or fought them yet, so he couldn\u2019t draw any conclusions.\"Good brother, your imposing manner is comparable to what mine was in the past!\" Su Meiyao nodded her head in satisfaction, her face filled with a charming smile.Chen Xiang proudly smiled: \"Two sisters, Now can I go to the Extreme Martial Sect? Perhaps I can also get you some brand new clothes.\"\"Little rascal, you really know how to make us happy.\" said Su Meiyao with a soft snort.\"You can, but you still have to be a little cautious. Inside these martial sects there are hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and in their eyes, with this little bit of strength, you\u2019re still an ant.\" Bai Youyou cautioned. Although she and Su Meiyao were only active in this herbal garden, they still felt very happy.Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou entered the ring. Chen Xiang walked out from the herbal garden and arrived at the inside of a mountain valley, his body shook a little while a pair of firewings emerged from his back. Chen Xiang took a fierce leap, jumping several tens of Zhang high in the air. The pair of Vermillion Bird Firewings behind his back flapped, making him soar in the sky.As he flew deeper and deeper into the forest, the Spirit Qi become richer and richer, and this caused Chen Xiang to be surprised, as he knew that the martial arts sect were located in a place with very rich Spirit Qi, but he wasn\u2019t aware of how rich the Spirit Qi was. Now that he had personally experienced this rich amount of Spirit Qi, he understood why so many people yearned to join these martial arts sects.\"It is similar to paradise here!\" said this while looking over the cliff of a high mountain, a giant river was flowing nearby, and there were numerous singing birds in that lush green forest below that was rich with Spirit Qi.\"In this side of the world, martial arts sects have the strongest influence. Of course, next to martial arts sect there are numerous families and empires who have similar influence. However, here there are also ordinary people who cannot practice martial arts, and these people are not few in number.\" Said Su Meiyao.As Su Meiyao spoke, Chen Xiang stood in awe of how big and strange the world was.Martial arts sects here have an ancient inheritance, meaning they were formed around various styles created by martial artists a long, long time ago. As time pa.s.sed, these martial arts sect started to develop and became even larger, as more and more people joined, they exploited more and more abundant resources. As a result, strong experts were as common as clouds here.While flying Chen Xiang suddenly heard a sound of disturbance below, he went down, only to see a person fighting a giant bull whose entire body was wrapped in flames.This was the demon beast, a kind of species who knew how to absorb Spirit Qi between heaven and earth. These beasts had innate Spiritual Veins, and it didn\u2019t matter whether their strength was strong or weak, every part of their body could be considered a treasure.Chen Xiang dived down and landed next to the intense battlefield, and that flaming bull was unexpectedly fighting a seemingly 18-19 years old fat teenager, whose appearance was quite matching. His appearance was similar to that of an expert bully.At this moment the fat teenager wrinkled his brow, his face was looking serious while dealing with the flaming bull at the other end. his strength was not bad, as he cultivated Metal True Qi, and his martial skill was also looking good. When he punched out, he played out his entire True Qi.\"Brother, do you need any help?\" Chen Xiang, who was now standing close by, asked. He could see that the fat teenager\u2019s foundation was not weak, and he guessed that he should be in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.\"Elder Brother, I fought most of the fight and now you appear. You say you want to help me, yet I bet you just want to steal my catch. Not worth it!\" That fatty\u2019s reply made Chen Xiang vomit blood. Unexpectedly this fatty was haggling over this.\"I simply do not need the reward, I just want to take a look at how formidable this demon beast is.\" Chen Xiang said with a smile.\"That's not OK, so be it, I'll give you the bull's leg!\" The fatty said, and to Chen Xiang\u2019s surprise this fatty was so principled.\"Good!\" Chen Xiang while speaking, took a step and in the blink of an eye, arrived behind the flaming bull. Chen Xiang's fist was starting to get wrapped in a golden aura of Slaughter Qi which was surging out, thereafter forming a golden white tiger head.Chen Xiang used [White Tiger Storm Killing Fist], but also used Metal White Tiger True Qi. His fist struck the thick body of that flaming bull, emitted a thunderous sound, and his golden aura flashed and blasted a b.l.o.o.d.y hole through the thick skin of flaming bull, which made the fatty astonished.\"Elder Brother, what type of fist attack did you use just now? It was so overbearing!\" Fatty asked with surprise, at the same a fist struck over the bull's head, and a fearsome Qi Aura burst out which even shook the air, the flaming bull emitted a heavy roar.While the flaming bull was angry, Chen Xiang took advantage of this opportunity and let a rain of blows strike on the fat body of that flaming bull. In the blink of an eye, he had punched out tens of fearsome and tyrannical Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fists, and a strong Qi Aura pa.s.sed through the bull's thick skin, shaking the internal organs of the flaming bull. The angry flaming bull immediately vomited a mouth full of blood, and then that bull was no longer able to use its strength.At this time, that fatty clasped his fists together, and held them high above his head, looking similar to a giant hammer. His fists fell towards the bull\u2019s head, and vigorous Metal True Qi transformed into a Qi Aura wrapped around his fists. In the blink of an eye with thunderous sounds accompanied with Qi waves flying in all directions, the bull was killed.\"Brother's fist technique is not bad!\" Chen Xiang said while praising, as he calculated the strength of this martial artist, and at such young age he was so amazing.That fatty smiled: \"I am called Zhu Rong, what's the honorable name of elder brother?\"\"Chen Xiang! I'm only 17, and Zhu brother called me elder brother \u8001\u54e5, you called me old \u8001, but I\u2019m younger than you.\" Chen Xiang smiled, cupping his fists as he spoke. He did have an air about him that made others think he was more mature than his physical age.Zhu Rong grinned: \"It seems I really called you old, hehe, but I also suffered a loss, regarding this, let's start from a clean slate. I guess I should call you younger brother? Your two years younger than me and already so amazing. You must certainly be from some famous family, but I do not know what family that is.\"[TLN: Ok, so maybe it is little bit confusing, but here some insight. Here Zhu Rong called Chen Xiang Laoge, and Chen Xiang is only 17 and he is 19 years old, and hence the intended pun.Laoge(\u8001\u54e5): affectionate form of address for a male who is not older than oneselfLaodi(\u8001\u5f1f) : affectionate form of address for a male who is not very much younger than oneself.Lao(\u8001) : old]Chen Xiang guessed Zhu Rong\u2019s family must do business , otherwise every time he opened his mouth he wouldn\u2019t have talked about transactions.\"I came from that side secular world.\" Chen Xiang truthfully said. Zhu Rong was starting to deal with that body of the flaming bull, and chopped down a leg for Chen Xiang, but also intentionally cut too small, which even made Chen Xiang somewhat dumbfounded.\"So do you want to enter the Extreme Martial Sect?\" Zhu Rong asked, the other end of that flaming bull entirely received in the storage pouch.\"En! Zhu brother are you a Extreme Martial Sect's disciple?\" Chen Xiang asked rhetorically, Zhu Rong followed behind him.\"Luckily I became a Extreme Martial Sect's disciple, and although your strength is pretty good, but you cannot enter the Extreme Martial Sect.\" said Zhu Rong while looking proudly.\"Why?\" Chen Xiang asked curiously.\"Because you do not have a family behind you, and you should know that the Extreme Martial Sect is different from other sects, and while all other sects receive their disciples, they provide the best welfare for those disciple. While the Extreme Martial Sect charges fees while receiving disciples.\" Zhu Rong said this point, and his face was full of contempt, as one could see that he very much fancied money.Chen Xiang had already heard of this thing before, that's why Su Meiyao made him take out Metal Spirit Fruit for Leng Youlan.\"You mean to say I cannot afford to enter extreme martial sect?\" Chen Xiang asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Extreme Martial ProvinceChen Xiang examined Zhu Rong from top to bottom, although his appearance was a little bit mature, he was wearing very ordinary clothes. His clothing lacked any kind of visible ornaments, resulting in a very poor visage.\"Do you know how much the Extreme Martial Sect charges? Just the cost for a year will make you retreat in defeat.\" Zhu Rong pursed his lips as he spoke, but suddenly he heard a \"kacha\" sound, as if someone was biting a fruit.Zhu Rong was a connoisseur of fine foods and he immediately turned his head, only to see Chen Xiang holding a purple fruit, taking a bite one after another, even going as far as spitting out some of the peel.Zhu Rong was stunned for a moment, then immediately shouted, \"Idiot, Are you using Purple Spirit Fruit for such thing? Quickly stop eating! f.u.c.k your mom! Those peels are extremely valuable and you're actually spitting them\u2026\u2026\u201dPurple Spirit Fruit was the main herb for refining True Qi Dan, to just consume the fruit was simply an extravagant waste. Upon seeing this, Zhu Rong could not wait to seize it from Chen Xiang\u2019s hands. In his opinion, to just directly eat the Purple Spirit Fruit was simply a blasphemy.Chen Xiang facial expression remained indifferent, \"This Purple Spirit Fruit is very tasty, and sweet too. There is even rich True Qi released after eating it.\"The gluttonous Zhu Rong turned dark red as he boiled in anger, although the Purple Spirit Fruit was not his, watching it being eaten in such a way caused him to have a heartache.\"Stop eating it, I'll buy the Purple Spirit Fruit.\" Zhu Rong quickly shouted, but just before he finished speaking, Chen Xiang swallowed the rest of the two-thirds of the fruit. Zhu Rong boiled as he felt an urge to rush over and shatter Chen Xiang's Chin.\"How much does it cost to enter Extreme Martial Sect for a year?\" Chen Xiang asked while smiling.Zhu Rong stamped his foot as he snorted with anger, \"You! Your type will never enter the Extreme Martial Sect.\" Although he did not Chen Xiang's ident.i.ty, he was very certain that he was extremely rich, otherwise he would not dare to eat Purple Spirit Fruit so casually.\"Forget that I even asked.\" Chen Xiang said as he took out another Purple Spirit Fruit to consume.\"Outer sect disciples need to pay 3000 middle-grade crystal stone for a year.\" Zhu Rong quickly said, then took out a few finger head size blue stone, and gave to Chen Xiang: \"Here, 10 middle-grade crystal stones for your Purple Spirit Fruit.\"Crystal stones and spirit coins were similar. They both were a kind of ore that contained Spirit Qi, however, the pure Spirit Qi compressed inside a crystal stone was much greater compared to a spirit coin.Chen Xiang had learned from Su Meiyao that on this side of world, middle-grade crystal stones were the main currency used for trading, and a middle-grade crystal stone was equivalent to 1000 large spirit coins. That is to say, 10 middle-grade crystal coins were worth only 10000 large spirit coins.\"Zhu brother, do you think I am a pig? This is the main ingredient for refining True Qi Dan, do you think its value is only worth this much? I might as well simply eat it.\" Chen Xiang said while pursing his lips.\"30!\" Said Zhu Rong with a deadpan look.Chen Xiang shook his head, and started walking towards the front, Zhu Rong was quick to follow, he shouted: \"50!\"Chen Xiang ignored him completely.\"60!\"\"100!\"\"150!\"\".................\"\"200!\"Chen Xiang turned around, and said with a smile: \"Just a moment ago you wanted it to buy for only 10 crystal stones, but now, compared to a moment ago, the price is many, many times greater, you definitely are a racketeer.\" Chen Xiang handed the Purple Spirit Fruit over, as he received a pool of crystal stones in return.\"Don\u2019t you know, my Zhu family is famous in Extreme Martial Province for doing business, we will even fight for a coin if it fell in front of us, there is no way we would leave it alone.\" Zhu Rong honestly said as he looked at the fruit, \"Purple Spirit Fruit prices in Extreme Martial Province are extremely inflated, because its prices have been raised by the merchants.\"Chen Xiang suddenly felt that he may have made a loss in the transaction, but 200000 Large spirit coins was also his bottom line.Although Zhu Rong was only a small racketeer, Chen Xiang talked very congenially to him since Chen Xiang now had a more thorough understanding of this side of world. The region he was in was called the 'Extreme Martial Province', a large piece of land under the jurisdiction of Extreme Martial Sect. It was very vast and all the different powers in this region had to pay tribute to the Extreme Martial Sect, and in turn the Extreme Martial Sect would guaranteed safeguard.\"Junior Brother Chen, in the future, do not eat the Purple Spirit Fruit like an idiot. If you were seen by the those alchemists, you will be certainly be beaten by every one of them.\" Zhu Rong said urgingly. As he thought of Chen Xiang eating a moment ago, his heart was secretly in pain.For Chen Xiang it does not matter, as long he had [Dragon Saliva Exercise], he could quickly create Purple Spirit Fruits if he ever ran out.\"Zhu Lao, you said is it possible for me to enter Extreme Martial Sect right now?\" Chen Xiang said with a laugh.Zhu Rong with a sinister smile said: \"Sell me 10 Purple Spirit Fruit and it will be possible, but you have to go through Extreme Martial Sect a.s.sessment to be able to genuinely enter, this is every sect\u2019s criteria.\"Chen Xiang followed Zhu Rong and came to a city. This city was called Tianmen City, and from here, the Extreme Martial Sect was not very far away. Quite often, many people who wanted to join the Extreme Martial Sect would stay here.Arriving there, Zhu Rong and Chen Xiang bid each other farewell. Zhu Rong said he must return, because unqualified people were not allowed to enter Extreme Martial Sect at will.\"Heavenly Gate. This is the entrance to Extreme Martial Sect?\" Chen Xiang stood next to the city gate, looking at the bold and powerful characters.[TLN: \u5929\u95e8 is written on the city gate, Chen Xiang was reading out loud.]As long as one walked across the city, one would be able to see a straight avenue. At the end of this avenue, there was a huge luxurious building that was comparable to a city. That was the Extreme Martial Sect!\"Little brother, this is a level-6 ordinary grade weapon. Discount price: only 999 crystal stones!\" one fellow standing at a store entrance shouted as he waved towards Chen Xiang. Just like Chen Xiang there were also many other people who were looking around after having entered the city; many of them were country hicks who had entered the city for the first time, and were most likely to be deceived.Weapons and armors could be divided into Ordinary, Spirit, and Brilliant Grade weapons. Each grade was further divided into 9 levels. Ordinary Grade weapons were the lowest ranked, and no matter what suitable material was used for forging, they were the most common materials. But a level 6 OrdinaryGgrade weapon was also considered to be not bad, and was close to an ordinary weapon of the 9th level.\"Little brother, want to buy some pills? A High Grade Mortal Level Grand Elemental Dan can be purchased for just 55 crystal stones, two dqns will only cost you a 100 crystal stones.\" An old man from a medicine shop shouted.Chen Xiang observed that within this Extreme Martial Province, Dan stores were located in almost every nook and corner of Extreme Martial Province. He could not help but be somewhat surprised. He went over and asked, \"Do you have a Purple Spirit Fruit?\"\"Of course I have it, only for 300 crystal stones!\" That old shopkeeper answered.Chen Xiang's mouth twitched slightly. He had really been fooled by that fatty, and that fatty in the start actually wanted to buy with 10 crystal stones, this time Chen Xiang also knew that here at this side of the world, dans were rather expensive, much more expensive than that they were in the Southern Martial Empire.This was a good thing for him, because he was an alchemist! He was now already able to see many white s.h.i.+ning crystal stone, and he also found out that one True Qi Dan costs 500 crystal stones here, moreover they were also a limited purchase.Chen Xiang strolled around in this Tianmen City and sold a few True Qi Dans, and soon collected as much as 3000 crystal stones, which was also the entrance fee for the Extreme Martial Sect. Although he had Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou\u2019s inheritance, but after entering a sect he could learn more things, learn more martial skills, also with the ident.i.ty of a sect's disciple, he could partic.i.p.ate in all kinds of compet.i.tions, where the winner was also rewarded by the sect.Chen Xiang walked towards the giant door in the distance., As the giant door was opened, many people came out, these few days the Extreme Martial Sect had opened their mountain entrance to recruit disciples, so many people came here to enter the sect, but the majority of these people were here to try their luck.Chen Xiang pa.s.sed through that giant door, walked on a straight and s.p.a.cious bricked avenue. In the distance, Extreme Martial Sect was surrounded by a 20 or so zhang high wall. Chen Xiang also had believed previously that the Extreme Martial Sect was built on top of a mountain.Chen Xiang stood in front of that Huge Entrance, watching 'Extreme Martial Sect Heavenly Gate' these three imposing characters, in his heart could not help but upwell a heroic spirit. That giant door was still closed, but a small door was opened.In front of that small door was a very long queue, whose Spiritual Veins were being examined, only those who had a Spiritual Vein were qualified. Of course, if there was not enough crystal stones then it was also not acceptable.The Spiritual Vein was examined by standing on top of a circular disc, on the disc there was an array, which could detect the Spiritual Vein within the human body, then different kinds of aura would be illuminated, along with it, the corresponding value would appear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Avenge Personal Enmity In The Name Of Public InterestAlthough many people had Spiritual Veins, but most of them were unqualified, and only someone with a value above 60 will be qualified. Chen Xiang, who was lined up for half day, had only seen two people to qualify.\"Chen Xiang, when you're a.s.sessed, you must converge metal, wood, water, earth attributes using [Tai Chi Divine Exercise], so at that time that array will only detect your fire attribute, and will show that you have fire attribute Spiritual Vein.\" Su Meiyao said seriously, as she couldn\u2019t allow other people to know that Chen Xiang had a Yin and Yang Divine Vein. This was a very dangerous matter.Chen Xiang\u2019s turn arrived, and when Chen Xiang stood on the disc, he did it in accordance with what Su Meiyao said and converged the metal, wood, water, earth attributes. In doing so below his feet on that disc only a red aura emerged, and a strange feeling appeared in his body, while one value also appeared in the middle of that disc.\"Fire attribute Spiritual Vein, 75, qualified, what's your name?\" one middle-aged man asked, and though Chen Xiang had pa.s.sed, but looking at Chen Xiang whose complexion was not good, his face fell.Just a moment ago Chen Xiang saw not a small number of Extreme Martial Sect's disciples being respectful towards this middle-aged man, and looking at this one could know that this middle-aged man had some status in the Extreme Martial Sect's Outer Sect. Strength was also very powerful, and Chen Xiang suspected that this middle-aged man must be a True Martial Realm martial artist!\"Chen Xiang!\"Chen Xiang's words made that middle-aged man to be surprised for a moment, and Chen Xiang felt a little strange, as he did not expect his name would spread to the Extreme martial sect.\"You came from the secular world?\" That middle-aged man coldly asked.\"Yes.\" after hearing Chen Xiang's word, all the people around him gave a bizarre look, because people who came from the secular world were generally old men, and someone so young was very rare.\"Please go back, you've done all kinds of evil in the secular world, we do not accept these kind of people in the Extreme Martial Sect!\" That middle-aged man sneered, his face full of hatred.\"What do you mean?\" Chen Xiang asked with a frown.\"When you were inside the secular world, you slaughtered one family, and also eliminated one gang called the Black Wind Gang. You've killed at least more than a 1000 people, and we of the Extreme Martial Sect don\u2019t receive this kind of slaughtering human devil.\" The middle-aged man\u2019s voice became louder, and this made the people all around more surprised, even to kill more than 1000 people.Chen Xiang said with a sneer, \"If someone came to kill you, would you not fight back? Are you going to stand there and allow them to kill you? Not only did that family act against me again and again, but they also colluded with the gang to a.s.sa.s.sinate me! If I did not kill them, they were going to destroy my family. Everything that happened because they asked for it. In Southern Martial Empire, most people know it, so you must not have not investigated clearly, right?\"That middle-aged man faced turned gloomy, and this time Chen Xiang once again said, \"Are you that Yao family member? Humph, do you want to use the power in your hands to avenge personal enmity in the name of public interest?\u201d\"Yao Haisheng, regarding this you're wrong, the other person's Spiritual Vein is obviously qualified, and we have also heard the things about the secular world, indeed your family was wrong, always wanting to exterminate others, but were destroyed in the end. That is also a matter of course.\" One amiable looking, smiling middle-aged man with a long beard arrived, and behind him was actually that Zhu Rong.Chen Xiang had guessed correctly, as that middle-aged man who making things difficult for him just a moment ago, was actually a Yao family member.Since he was Yao family member, then he must be an alchemist, as Chen Xiang could sense the pure Fire True Qi from his body, and ordinarily only alchemists were very focused on Fire True Qi purity.Yao Haisheng gave a disgusted look to that bearded middle-aged man, and unenthusiastically said, \"Hao Dongqing, I manage the things around here, my words counts!\"Chen Xiang in his heart was secretly surprised, that bearded man, Hao Dongqing, unexpectedly was also a True Martial Realm expert. Chen Xiang hadn't expected to meet to True Martial Realm martial artists in one day. Moreover the strength of the True Martial Realm was more than what he had imagined. He was very clear that he was absolutely unable to defeat these True Martial Realm martial artists.\"Brat, also not getting out of here, is it that you want my teacher to personally send you?\" One arrogant man from behind Yao Haisheng loudly reprimanded.Hao Dongqing faintly smiled: \"He cannot leave, as today many people are witnessing this matter. If he leaves, it will be bad for the Extreme Martial Sect's reputation!\"Chen Xiang knew Hao Dongqing was helping him, so he laughed and said, \"The Extreme Martial Sect is Chenwu mainland's strongest martial arts sect. I think it should be fair and impartial.\"Yao Haisheng was bent on Chen Xiang not entering the Extreme Martial Sect, so he coldly said, \"Chen Xiang, you're very young, and your strength is also good, but you now need to hone your character, as your disposition is too easy to stir up trouble. Furthermore your strength in the Extreme Martial Sect here does not simply account for anything. If you enter the Extreme Martial Sect it will invite only trouble.\"\"Please go back! I have the authority to investigate various aspect of one entering the sect and becoming a disciple. Though your Spiritual Vein is qualified, but in regards to your disposition and strength you're not qualified. Come back after 3-5 years, and maybe you\u2019ll be able to qualify then. The Extreme Martial Sect's gate is always open for you.\"Yao Haisheng do not want to destroy the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s reputation, as although he was a True Martial Realm martial artist, but if he were to commit a mistake, he would be equally punished.\"Within 5 years, as long as you defeat my apprentice Fang Liang \u65b9\u826f, you can enter the Extreme Martial Sect and furthermore you don't have to pay a single dime. So you better go back and cultivate.\" Yao Haisheng contemptuously said, while behind him that arrogant man with one eye also stared at Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang asked, \"You said if I defeat your apprentice Fang Liang within 5 years, then after that I can enter Extreme martial sect and I'll be also exempted of all fees? Is this true?\"Yao Haisheng\u2019s sinister laughter resounded, and said, \"Of course, you came from my hometown, and this is me giving you favourable treatment, but if you can not win in 5 years, then you can never enter the Extreme Martial Sect.\"\"Fang Liang? Is he that Fang family\u2019s genius, currently 18 years old, and already entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm? Moreover, he also has many Profound Level Martial Skills, and last I heard he fought the 9th Grade Demon Beast, the Fire Red Falcon. In the end the Fire Red Falcon was struck and died on a mountain top, and it is said that he is also ranked 13th in all the Outer Sect Disciples.\u201dFang Liang heard some commenting about him, and he became prouder, and his face was completely full of a proud look. Yao Haisheng was also similarly proud, because he was Fang Liang\u2019s teacher.\"Brat, you do not even have a teeny tiny bit chance in 100 years! Because within 5 years I will certainly enter the True Martial Realm, and you\u2019ll forever not have the chance to defeat me.\"Fang Liang loudly said, his arrogance was soaring in the sky, as within 5 years he would certainly enter the True Martial Realm! This made many people, one after another, to be shock, as such a young True Martial Realm martial artist was very rare.\"Within 5 years if I win against Fang Liang, I really can enter the Extreme Martial Sect for free?\" Chen Xiang asked again, as this kind of thing was better to be confirmed, because to him it seemed very easy. Before he had heard to enter the Extreme Martial Sect's Outer Sect, he had to go through a series of complex a.s.sessments.\"So many people are listening here, do you think I'll lie to you? Within 5 years you can come whenever you want and challenge him. Now quickly go, you're making many people who want to test their Spiritual Vein wait !\" Yao Haisheng impatiently waved his hand, driving away Chen Xiang.\"You said within 5 years I can come whenever I want and challenge him? This is what you said!\" Chen Xiang grinned, and said, \"I want to compete with him today.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 Asking for TroubleWhat? Chen Xiang wanted to compete with the genius Fang Ling today? This made many people surprised, but Yao Haisheng and Fang Liang were also shocked.Just a moment ago Hong Dongqing also helped Chen Xiang because he was very interested in watching what was about to happen. Zhu Rong, however, secretly despised Chen Xiang, because he had just found out that Chen Xiang was an alchemist, and previously, when he had first met him, Chen Xiang had portrayed himself in a much more low profile manner.\"Hah! Quit joking and quickly leave, lest you get injured. During a compet.i.tion it is difficult to control one\u2019s strength, if you get wounded, it will certainly slow you down. Come back after a few years of cultivation.\"Yao Haisheng waved his hand and said. How the Yao family was eliminated was not very clear, he only knew that Chen Xiang was the cause of this incident. He speculated Chen Xiang strength might be equivalent to the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, but in his opinion, the difference between a secular 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and an Extreme Martial Sect 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm was like heaven and earth.\"If people want to fight, they should go ahead and fight.\" Hong Dongqing said, he glanced and smiled at Chen Xiang.\"Concerning this fight, I'll be able to waste him in just one move.\" Fang Liang had a look of impatience.Chen Xiang didn't even expect there to be Yao family members in the Extreme Martial Sect, furthermore, they were also in the True Martial Realm. Fortunately, there were some rules in the sects. People from this side of the world are not allowed to cause trouble in the secular world.The people standing in line for a.s.sessment all spread out, although their a.s.sessment is delayed by this battle, they looked forward to watching a good fight as they get to see Fang Liang fight. The crowd looked forward to seeing the strength of the Outer Sect\u2019s #13.\"Forewarned, if you're injured, you can not blame the other, blame yourself for being a waste.\" Fang Liang loudly said.Chen Xiang nodded his head and said, \"If you are seriously injured, it is your own fault and cannot be blamed on the other.\"\"Correct, do not talk nonsense, let's go!\" Fang Liang with a look of irritability, took a step forward, only to hear Yao Haisheng shout, \"Start!\"Fang Liang was the first to act, and he began running, each step exploding outward with lightning, like he was running on lighting. He moved very quickly, and both of his fists were also wrapped in white lightning. This was pure Lightning True Qi.Chen Xiang's Lightning True Qi contained the wood attribute inside and was different from pure lightning.\"High Grade Profound Level [Treading Lightning Steps], running will result in ma.s.sive impact force! This Fist Art is the High Grade Profound Level [Shocking Lightning Fist], and from what I have heard, with this Fist Art, one can split a small mountain. Its power is enormous.\" said one well-informed martial artist.Chen Xiang originally was a lightning expert, and when he started to cultivate wood True Qi, he also often incited lightning to temper his body. He was struck by violent, natural lighting, but he was still able to bear it. As of now, lightning did not pose any threat to him, not to mention the fact that his body was also very formidable.Everyone believed that when Chen Xiang was struck by the [Shocking lightning fist], a b.l.o.o.d.y hole would be left. The crowd braced themselves, in order to resist the explosion from the Lightning True Qi. However, they were all amazed, because what they envisioned didn't occur.Fang Liang jumped out, his momentum increased by the lighting at his feet, and at the same time, also punched out a powerful [Shocking lightning fist], striking towards Chen Xiang's chest, but when his fists came in contact with Chen Xiang's chest, it felt similar to stone sinking in the sea, he didn't get a bit of response.Because, in that moment, Chen Xiang operated [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and his body was truly like a giant vortex, in which any kind of power striking it would, in the end, be sucked in by the vortex. Chen Xiang guided the lightning to temper his body, he does frequently, and that was also why his lightning true Qi cultivation was better.\"Extreme Martial Sect, I'll definitely enter it!\" Chen Xiang laughed as he spoke. His fist blasted towards Fang Liang, who was still dazed, and a ma.s.sive amount of flames surged from his fist, similar to a volcano erupting. In the blink of an eye, Fang Liang was embroiled in flames and sent flying by the momentum of Chen Xiang\u2019s fist. His whole body was quickly incinerated by that intense fire, and he was rolling on the ground howling.\"Fang Liang!\" Yao Haisheng shouted with dismay and hastily flew towards him. He waved his sleeve and the flames were immediately dispersed. Fang Laing was burnt black from top to bottom. It was obvious he was severely injured, as the meridians within his body were also burnt.Though it was quite hot, all those who were watching felt their bodies drenched in cold sweat! A simple fist attack defeated the 13th Outer Sect Disciple of the Extreme Martial Sect. When everyone thought about how Fang Laing previously looked down upon Chen Xiang, they were struck by the humor of the situation.\"I won, now is it possible for me to enter Extreme Martial Sect? Furthermore, I won't even have to pay crystal stones!\" Chen Xiang grinned.Yao Haisheng was furious, just as he wanted to say something, but he saw Hao Dongqing speaking with a smile, \"Yao Haisheng, previously this precious disciple of yours said, if during the compet.i.tion get's hurt, that is their own matter, and he was not going to blame the other! Is it that you want to destroy your apprentice\u2019s promise? Also, you said Chen Xiang can enter the Extreme Martial Sect. Moreover, he does not need to pay the other expenses, these crystal stones must come from you because you made him a promise.\"Chen Xiang said with a laugh, \"Senior brother Yao, you're really going to pay the crystal stones for me? I'm really grateful.\"Yao Haisheng\u2019s face fiercely twitched, in his mind, Chen Xiang was only an ant and with just a pat of his palm Chen Xiang would be dead, but if he did so his good days would come to an end because the rules of the Extreme Martial Sect were very strict.\"I'll remember this!\" Yao Haisheng picked up the burnt body of Fang Liang and entered the Extreme Martial Sect inside, and at this time the person responsible for a.s.sessment was also changed.\"Chen junior brother, welcome to Extreme Martial Sect, come with me, I'll take you to complete the formalities.\" Zhu Rong, that little fatty, shouted, and while watching Chen Xiang the expression in his eyes were as if he was looking at a lot of crystal stones.Chen Xiang laughed and walked past :\"Many thanks, senior brother Hao, otherwise, I would have been driven away by him.\"\"I just said a few words, that's is not counted any help, but saw this guy digging few fiery pits for himself and his apprentice to jump into, and I was truly laughing to death! Of course, you also pushed them into the fiery pit that they dug with their own hands.\" Hao Dongqing\u2019s laughter resounded as he turned around and left.\"Little fatty, how is senior brother Hao related to you? Is he your teacher?\" Chen Xiang, following behind Zhu Rong, asked in a low voice. To have a True Martial Realm martial artist as a teacher, that was also a very good thing.\"He is my uncle! By the way, you actually knew alchemy and also wasted a Purple Spirit Fruit, you idiot! You really like to show off.\" Zhu Rong, thinking about Chen Xiang eating the Purple Spirit Fruit, his heart could not help but feel slightly sore.Chen Xiang scoffingly said, \"You treacherous fatty, in the beginning, you wanted to buy my Purple Spirit Fruit for just 10 crystal stones. Just a moment ago I asked other people and they are selling it for 300 crystal stones, you bought it from me for 200 crystal stones, you cheated me.\"Zhu Rong curled his lips and said, \"That is the price we agreed to, I did not force you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: 3000 Martial Courtyard\"Do you have a sister? Are they also formidable like you? Introduce them to me\" Zhu Rong hastily asked, his eyes lighting up.\"Go f.u.c.k your sister. Even if I had a sister I wouldn\u2019t introduce her to you!\" said Chen Xiang with disdain. Now that he had entered the sect, he wanted to find Leng Youlan, his stepsister. He was now her brother and as a brother, he wanted to take good care of her.Zhu Rong snorted in a low voice, \"Do not look at me like this. Many girls who came for this entrance test throw themselves on me. This daddy is the Zhu family\u2019s great young master, and also an Inner Sect Disciple of the Extreme Martial Sect!\"Chen Xiang was surprised by the fact that Zhu Rong was an Inner Sect Disciple. He had heard that only someone of the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm could enter the Inner Sect!\"Zhu Lao, in the past few months have you heard about a white haired girl coming to the Extreme Martial Sect for the a.s.sessment?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"I remember, I'll never forget her!\" Zhu Rong immediately said, his complexion turned serious: \"This girl was very extraordinary. She actually had a Fire and Ice Dual Vein. Furthermore they seemed to be Heaven Veins. She wanted to enter the Extreme Martial Sect, but other people took her away?\"\"What?\" Chen Xiang was very surprised, he had not expected that Leng Youlan would have Tian Veins, moreover be taken by another sect. If it was a devil path sect, wouldn't that be bad?\"Rest a.s.sured, she was taken by the people of Icewind Valley, that place is more suitable for her! She should not be your unrequited love, right? Relying on your talent, you do not even deserve her shoes.\" Zhu Rong contemptuously looked at Chen Xiang, he knew Leng Youlan came from the secular world, only then would he think like this.Chen Xiang sighed and said, \"She is my sister, sworn stepsister.\"\"Your joking, how can you have that immortal like character as a sworn sister? If she was your sister, then Xue Xianxian of the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire is also my sister.\" Zhu Rong loudly shouted, as he could not accept this fact.Chen Xiang had also not thought that Xue Xianxiang was actually so famous, his sighing sound was heard once again: \"Xue Xianxian is my fiancee.\"\"f.u.c.k you! This b.a.s.t.a.r.d is cracking jokes now! You should be careful what you say, otherwise you may be beaten flat by those who have a crush on Xue Xianxian, so do not blame me or say that I did not warn you! Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan are but recognized as the strongest women among the younger generation. In our hearts, they are like fairies, if you violate or offend them again, I'll beat you up!\" Zhu Rong angrily said.Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed, while in his heart he said, \"Xianxian is really my fiancee and Youlan is really my stepsister!\"Zhu Rong with Chen Xiang came to one large courtyard, and inside this courtyard many people were comparing notes with each other. They were not using True Qi, and they were only using their physical strength, but their attacks were still unusually strong.\"This is the 330th Martial Courtyard. The smaller their numeral digit, the stronger it is. The 330th Martial Courtyard is the strongest Martial Courtyard in the Outer Sect, and as you defeated that Fang Liang guy, this is the most appropriate place for you!\" Zhu Rong said.Everyone in this Martial Courtyard suddenly quieted down, because they had also heard the information about Fang Liang being defeated! Fang Liang was the 13th ranked disciple in the Outer Sect, and was unexpectedly defeated by a newcomer. This was but explosive information in the Outer Sect.Everyone looked carefully at Chen Xiang. Everyone here were very able-bodied, and the youngest was about 20 years old, while the eldest was about 50-60 years old. A total of fifty people, and this was the strongest Martial Courtyard in the Outer Sect. In other words, the strongest disciples in the Outer Sect were also in here!\"Old man Zhang, this brat will be handed over to you.\" Zhu Rong said to one old man.Although he looked like a fat meatball, Zhu Rong was still an Inner Sect Disciple, so even the strongest disciples of the Outer Sect were full of respect when they see him.\"Younger brother Chen, try hard to enter the Inner Martial Courtyard earlier, and do not die in the Outer Martial Courtyard.\" Zhu Rong patted Chen Xiang\u2019s shoulder, and sped away.When the disciple of this Martial Courtyard saw Chen Xiang and Zhu Rong have such a good relations.h.i.+p, they could not help but feel a little uncertain. They definitely tried to guess which family Chen Xiang came from.\"Junior brother Chen Xiang, about the matter of you defeating Fang Liang, I've also heard. Please come with me.\" That old man Zhang said.Chen Xiang followed behind him, leaving the sight of those Outer Sect Disciples in this Martial Courtyard, and at this time these disciples also started discussing.......That old man Zhang was called Zhang De. He was seventy years old and was at the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, but had failed to enter Inner Sect, because he had stayed in the Extreme Martial Sect for too long, so he just pa.s.ses off as this courtyard\u2019s chief. In other words, he was the strongest person in the 330th Martial Courtyard.Zhang De was a very good person, always having a gentle smile on his face, and was very considerate towards other, which made Chen Xiang have a very favourable impression of him.\"Senior brother Zhang, is it really hard to enter the Inner Martial Courtyard?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"Difficult, difficult as ascending heaven! It has already been 15 years since I entered the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and partic.i.p.ated in 15 a.s.sessments, but in all a.s.sessments I have never pa.s.sed.........\" Zhang De said with a long sigh, as he handed Chen Xiang a storage pouch, \"This is the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s uniform, ident.i.ty card, and some introductory books about the the Extreme Martial Sect and this world.\"To enter the Inner Sect, one must pa.s.s through an a.s.sessment. This was not like what Chen Xiang had previously heard \u2018one must be in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm to enter the Inner Sect\u2019. It seemed that the Extreme Martial Sect was very strict.Chen Xiang once again followed Zhang De for a long time and then arrived at his own house. This was but a small residence, only suitable for one person but Chen Xiang was very satisfied.\"Junior brother Chen, this is the strongest Outer Sect's Martial Courtyard, which only had 50 people. That's why we have this kind of treatment so you have to carefully keep this position. I'll leave now, so you should familiarize with this environment first.\"After Zhang De left, Chen Xiang opened those books and started understanding more about the Extreme Martial Sect.\"The Eight Major Righteous Sects are divided into the Extreme Martial Sect \u592a\u6b66\u95e8, the Divine Weapons Heavenly Empire \u795e\u5175\u5929\u56fd, the Danxiang Taoyuan \u4e39\u9999\u6843\u6e90, the Icewind Valley \u51b0\u98ce\u8c37, the Beast Martial Sect \u517d\u6b66\u95e8, the Proud Sword Sect \u50b2\u5251\u5b97, the True Martial Sect \u771f\u6b66\u95e8, and the Lotus Island \u83b2\u82b1\u5c9b.\"\"The Five Great Devil Sects are divided into the Devil Yang Clan \u9b54\u9633\u5b97, the Myriad Snake Valley \u4e07\u86c7\u8c37, the Blood Refining Clan \u8840\u70bc\u5b97, the 100 Poison Sect \u767e\u6bd2\u95e8, and the Transforming Bone Clan \u5316\u9aa8\u95e8.\"\"Every Major Righteous Sect commands one province each, while the Five Great Devil Sects are gathered in one large province, called the Chenwu Nine Province \u8fb0\u6b66\u4e5d\u5dde............\"Chen Xiang read through the introductory book. Although Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had once told him about the world, there were many more details written in this book.After reading it, Chen Xiang lamented, saying, \"This is just the Chenwu Continent, and it is already so big, and in addition to this, outside the seas there are other continents.\"\"This is not the end! We are in this mortal world, which is the lowest level world, generally called a Mortal Martial World. There hundreds of thousands of them! Each one has countless mainlands!\" Bai Youyou said with disdain.\"Above Mortal Martial World is the Heaven Martial World, of which there are a couple dozen. The martial artists in that world are equivalent to immortal like existences, their powers are much stronger.\" Su Meiyao continued after Bai Youyou.Chen Xiang swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He suddenly felt like he was a grain of sand in a huge world!He shook his head, he did not want to go down.\"The Extreme Martial Sect has a total of 3000 Martial Courtyards, 330th to 3000th Martial Courtyards are outer Martial Courtyards! 16th-329th Martial Courtyards are the inner Martial Courtyards, and the 1st-15th Martial Courtyards are core disciple\u2019s Martial Courtyard. They are also the most powerful force in the Extreme Martial Sect. Above the 3000 Martial Courtyard there is one 0th Martial Courtyard, and that is the elder courtyard, a group thousands of years old codgers live in it. The Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s Dean is the 0th Martial Courtyard\u2019s Chief!\" Chen Xiang continued to look at the introduction of the Extreme Martial Sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 Outer Martial CourtyardThere were many Outer Sect Disciples; however, the inner sect disciples count took a dive, and the core disciples were even meager to count. Besides, there were only 15 core disciple Martial Courtyards!Usually, all core disciples were above the True Martial Realm.\"As long as you have enough strength, you can not only enter the Elder Courtyard but can also sit on the 0th Martial Courtyard's Chief's position! That is if you can defeat the Dean!\"Hearing this, Chen Xiang had a kind of a whimsical idea, which was to get that 0th Martial Courtyard's Chief's position. Of course, it was just an idea, as it should be known that these dean level characters had been living for hundreds of years and were somewhat like old monsters.\"The 0th Martial Courtyard's Chief position is much more difficult to achieve, but the Extreme Dan Courtyard's Chief position shouldn't be that hard.\" Su Meiyao said with a light laugh.The Extreme Dan Courtyard was the organization responsible for dans here in the Extreme Martial Sect. Although there was only one courtyard, it was however divided into 8 small courtyards where all alchemists dwelled.\"Only a 2nd level Alchemist can enter the Extreme Dan Courtyard. Now I want to take a look how many levels................\" Chen Xiang illuminated a list and saw that a 1st level Alchemist was required to be able to refine 3 different kinds of Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans.A 2nd level Alchemist was required to be able to refine three kinds of High Grade Mortal Level Dans and a Low-Grade Spirit Level Dan. The requirements to become a 3rd level Alchemist were high, and one must actually be able to refine three kinds of Middle-Grade Spirit Level Dan.Currently, Chen Xiang himself was only a 2nd level Alchemist. 9th level was the highest rank of any alchemist. Above it was the Great Dan Master, Dan Ancestor, and then Dan King!Chen Xiang remembered Su Meiyao saying that she was just a Dan Ancestor, and she was capable of refining Heaven Level Dans!At last Chen Xiang once again looked at the next aspects of refining weapons. Refiners were rare in the Extreme Martial Sect, and there were hardly any. While the Chenwu Mainland\u2019s Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire was most developed in regards to refining weapons, the strongest in alchemy was Danxiang Taoyuan, and mainly the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s strength was powerful.That Leng Youlan went to Icewind Valley, which only cultivated in extreme yin and yang, and had the lowest amount of disciples. Nevertheless, their strength wasn't weak, as their True Qi is very extreme, so their overall strength is strong.Although among the Eight Major Righteous Sects, the Extreme Martial Sect was recognized as the strongest, if the Extreme Martial Sect and another sect fought, the Extreme Martial Sect won't win the fight without paying a large price.\"Meiyao sister, Youyou sister, how about I find a way to make a Grandmaster Alchemist here to refine a dan for you. That way you will soon be able to recover from your injuries.\" Chen Xiang's eyes lit up at the moment.\"Are they able to refine Sacred Level Dan?\" Bai Youyou asked.Sacred Level Dan! Chen Xiang had not even heard of what they were speaking of, let alone seeing it.\"Is there no one here capable of refining it?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"At least from what I have heard, they temporarily don\u2019t have anyone. Not to mention Sacred Level Dan, those who can refine Heaven Level Dan are rare.\" Su Meiyao said with a sigh, \"But you may just be able to as long as you cultivate and collect good herbs because you have the [Dragon Saliva Exercise].\"Chen Xiang hadn't expected that he actually needed to refine a Sacred Level Dan; how high of a level was this existence.\"First, enter the inner sect then we will talk about it. Only after entering the inner sect, would I be able to learn a satisfying martial skill!\" Chen Xiang said because Outer Sect Disciples at best could only learn Low-Grade Profound Level Martial Skills while High-Grade Profound Level and Earth Level Martial Skills needed the qualifications of an inner sect disciple to learn.At the tenth month of every year, it was the Inner Sect a.s.sessment, which was just around the corner, and Chen Xiang hadn't expected that it would arrive in such a timely manner.Chen Xiang climbed onto the roof, watching all the numerous buildings around him. In the innermost part of the deep region, strong people were gathered like clouds in the inner courtyard!The Extreme Martial Sect's disciple enjoyed much of their freedom, and sect disciples were provided with a large number of martial skills. The Extreme Martial Sect also had arranged some experienced old martial artists to teach the disciples, and there were also many types of equipment to aid in their training, as well as the martial stage for the disciples to fairly compare notes.Sometimes, the Extreme Martial Sect arranged some missions for their sect disciple to complete, and these missions protected the Extreme Martial Province from danger.Chen Xiang put on the Extreme Martial Sect's uniform which was a gray leotard, made of a material which could even withstand ordinary flames. Ordinary swords also could not penetrate it, and it also fit tightly to the body, making people feel very comfortable. It also had a \u2018warm in winter and cool in summer\u2019 effect.Chen Xiang arrived in the middle of the Martial Courtyard, and in the middle there was one small square stage. All around the square stage there were some buildings, and inside these buildings was the equipment to help the disciples with their training.\"Newcomer, I heard you came from that secular world. It seems that you are very powerful, and was able to defeat that Fang Liang in a matter of seconds.\" One teenager came and said with a look of admiration.From those previous books, Chen Xiang had learned Chenwu Mainland was shaped like a triangle, and that the secular world was located in one of its corners. That corner was also across a large mountain range, isolated from the eight major provinces, and had spa.r.s.e Spirit Qi, which led to not many strong experts being there.Chen Xiang slightly smiled, and said, \"That guy underestimated the enemy too much, that's why he lost miserably.\"Teenager laughed and said, \"That's true since that guy Fang Liang had wors.h.i.+ped a teacher, he became arrogant. I wanted to teach him a lesson early on myself.\"This teenager's skin was dark, and he was shorter than Chen Xiang by a head. Although he didn\u2019t look very strong, he gave off the impression that he was quick, capable and vigorous.His eyes glittered with sleekness, had an amiable smile, but there were a few scars on his face, giving off a st.u.r.dy feeling.\"Yun Xiaodao \u4e91\u5c0f\u5200, are you thinking whether or not to bully the newcomer once again?\" From afar one middle-aged man said with a smile, \"Chen Xiang, this shorty standing in front of you is this courtyard strongest disciple, but he doesn't want to become the courtyard's chief and has not challenged the old man Zhang yet.\"Yun Xiaodao rubbed his nose, contemptuously side glanced at that fellow, and said, \"I just wanted to compare notes with him. Martial artists originally often want to compare notes.\"In this square, there were many people, and they all had temperate and gentle smiles on their faces, making Chen Xiang feel very harmonious in this Martial Courtyard. Moreover, he also learned from other people that they all thought that Fang Liang was very annoying.Chen Xiang had just arrived; that's why people in this Martial Courtyard didn't start to cultivate, rather chatted with Chen Xiang and informed him of some things.Chen Xiang at this time just knew that Yun Xiaodao came here three years ago, and from the 3000th Martial Courtyard fought his way up from there. He was very strong, at the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and he had a prominent origin. He was a member of one of the Extreme Martial Province's four aristocratic families, the Yun family.At this moment, Yun Xiaodao, with an avid expression in his eyes, was watching Chen Xiang, and spoke, \"Great Brother Chen, except for the old man Zhang here, I've fought with everyone here. You also have to fight one round with me, and no matter if you win or lose, I'll give you five True Qi Dan, how does this sound?\"Old man Zhang was Zhang De, this Martial Courtyard's Chief, but all martial artists in here called him in the same way.Chen Xiang knew Yun Xiaodao was very bellicose. Moreover, he was this courtyard\u2019s strongest disciple, which meant that he was the strongest disciple in the Outer Sect!\"Xiaodao, you're in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm while I'm in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the difference is too big!\" said Chen Xiang while shaking his head and smiling, and to his surprise, this Yun Xiaodao was actually only 16 years old!Inside this Chenwu Mainland's martial forest was where the talent really poured forth, and young and powerful martial artists could be found everywhere.\"But you're one year older than me, so you have the advantage. Rest a.s.sured; I'll be lenient, and whether you win or lose, I'll give you 5 True Qi Dan!\" Yun Xiaodao pestered. He was not planning to let Chen Xiang go until he fought with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 Outer Courtyard First DiscipleIn the eyes of other martial artists, 5 True Qi Dans might be very good, but give Chen Xiang half of an hour and he could refine them out, and currently he did not want to get seriously injured, instead he wanted to prepare for the upcoming Inner Sect a.s.sessment.Yun Xiaodao, this time with a sinister smile, said, \"Great brother Chen, I've several sisters, each one is very nice, so if you and I compare notes, I'll introduce them to you!\"Chen Xiang could not help laughing, \"You brat, do not try fool me. You just said you\u2019ll introduce them to me, but later I won\u2019t be able to pursue them, right?\"Yun Xiaodao stuck out his tongue, \"Why do you've so little confidence in yourself? I've heard you know alchemy. My sister\u2019s first preference of a man is an alchemist. Rarely has there been an alchemist like you who is young, smart and handsome.\"\"f.u.c.k your mother's p.u.s.s.y, your this flattery is not bad. I'll reluctantly fight a round with you!\" Chen Xiang said with a smile, \"But as for your sisters, leave it for others, I already have a fiancee.\"Seeing Chen Xiang promise Yun Xiaodao, other martial artists also cheered up, because they also wanted to take a look at Chen Xiang's strength. By observing and emulating other battles could they themselves also learn some experiences.Yun Xiaodao was also delighted, like a child, he very readily took out 5 True Qi Dans and handed them to Chen Xiang. He was a Yun family member, moreover, he was also talented, so in aspects of dans he was simply not lacking.\"Great brother Chen, to tell you the truth, even if I introduce my sisters to you, they will not fancy you. The standards of these women can be high.\" Yun Xiaodao took a side glance at those sitting disciple at the square edge, and these disciples revealed an angry expression, apparently they had been fooled by Yun Xiaodao.This time, Zhang De ran over hastily, and said with a smile, \"You and a newcomer are having a compet.i.tion, how can it precede without me? I'll preside over it, and at appointed time will immediately stop you, as I don\u2019t want anyone getting injured in a friendly compet.i.tion.\"Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao went to the middle of the square, and here the floor was paved using a kind of very st.u.r.dy bricks. They were very difficult to destroy, therefore one could fearlessly fight till the end.\"Xiaodao, are you going to partic.i.p.ate in the Inner Sect a.s.sessment?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"I\u2019ve partic.i.p.ated three times, but each time in the second round I failed. I just entered the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm this year, so this year I'll be able to enter the Inner Sect.\"Chen Xiang nodded his head, and his complexion turned serious because he felt a peculiar martial artist True Qi from Yun Xiaodao. This type of True Qi gave people a kind of feeling that was very terrifying, however, it was very docile inside Yun Xiaodao's body.\"It should be Fire and Lightning True Qi.He should have a Mutated Fire Lightning Vein.\" said Su Meiyao.Extreme Martial Sect, 3000 Martial Courtyards, 100,000 disciples. People who could come must be someone with decent strength. After coming here Chen Xiang had met many young and strong martial artists, and in his front of him was a 16 year old teenager in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. This was the strongest person in the Outer Sect!\"Watch out, [Fire Lightning Chain]!\" Yun Xiaodao loudly shouted, and from his palm a fiery red colored lightning suddenly spewed out, surging with fearsome hot Qi, and hitting Chen Xiang's body.This fire lightning upon touching Chen Xiang's body, immediately tied down Chen Xiang, like a very firm chain, making Chen Xiang unable to move!\"Hei Hei, Great Brother Chen, you lose!\" said Yun Xiaodao while giggling, only to once again see both of his fists explode with that fearsome Fire Lightning Qi Aura. Although Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao were separated by 3 zhang, but Chen Xiang could feel that strong Qi Aura, and even the ground was slightly trembling.In the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, True Qi was compressed again. After this compression, it also elevated the quality of the True Qi, doubling their True Qi qualitatively and quant.i.tatively when compared to the previous 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm!But Yun Xiaodao didn't spend his true strength, otherwise it would be more frightening!At this moment, Chen Xiang operated his True Qi trying to get rid of the Qi Aura Chain binding him. While the [Fire Lightning Chain] was binding him up, it also continued to burst with lightning and scorching flames, which in turn entered into his body. If not for him using the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] to continue to refine them, he would certainly be a little tormented.Yun Xiaodao swooped over, both his fists shooting towards Chen Xiang's chest. When they were about to arrive, Chen Xiang fiercely opened his mouth, and a dragon roar resounded. A large amount of Azure Qi Aura was suddenly ejected from Chen Xiang's mouth, carrying terrifying lightning, and forming one huge momentum that flew towards Yun Xiaodao and hitting him.The sudden attack made Yun Xiaodao fly about ten zhang. This confused Yun Xiaodao and his hair was in a mess.Chen Xiang lowered his head and shouted, only to see the [Fire Lightning Chain] binding him suddenly burst open, forming a Qi waves which blew in all directions.\"Great brother Chen, you are quite shady, and actually have these kind of tricks!\" Yun Xiaodao had a look of displeasure. However, in his heart he was secretly thrilled, because Chen Xiang had not been defeated all of a sudden.The people all around who watching were also secretly shocked. Chen Xiang having this kind of martial skill also came as a surprise to them. True Qi could be discharged from the mouth, it was indeed a kind of very shady martial skill.The quality of Chen Xiang\u2019s True Qi was not worse than those at the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm as a result of being compressed, because just a moment ago if Chen Xiang had not fused the Azure Dragon and Vermillion Bird True Qi, it was also very difficult for him to get rid of the [Fire Lightning Chain].\"Xiaodao, I'll attack you now!\" Chen Xiang gripped both his fists, and Azure Dragon Lightning True Qi overflowed from his fists, and once again at the same time scorching Vermillion Bird Red Fire True Qi emerged out..At this time Chen Xiang had also used Fire Lightning True Qi!This duel turned out to be a duel between Fire Lightning True Qi and Fire Lightning True Qi, and everyone standing was immediately excited because it was worth watching. They also found it a little unusual because they had learnt Chen Xiang had a Fire Spiritual Vein, but he was still able to come up with Lightning True Qi.Chen Xiang took one step and arrived in front of Yun Xiaodao, \"Watch out, [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist]!\"Finished speaking, numerous fists with tiger head after images burst out, surging out one after another with pressuring Aura Qi, pounding at a breakneck speed, cutting through the air, and shaking the floor. Similar to a bombardment of lightning it madly flew towards Yun XIaodao, each one in blink of an eye. Chen Xiang punched out 100 times, and every fist was containing the strength which was capable of destroying a small mountain.\"Good fellas, this Martial Courtyard second rank is yours.\" Yun Xiaodao clenching his teeth said. With a palm full of Qi Aura, constantly waving, he was actually able to keep up with the speed of Chen Xiang's fist. It looked as if he had countless palms whilst resisting the impact of Chen Xiang's fist that was like violent storm..\"I want first!\" Chen Xiang said while laughing, and vainly shouted, \"[White Tiger Divine Fist]!\"Punching out one [White Tiger Divine Fist], suddenly a Slaughter Qi enveloped the center of this Martial Courtyard, and everyone could not help but have a s.h.i.+ver run down their spine, as they fell into a kind of inexplicable fear.Only to see both of Chen Xiang\u2019s fists suddenly transform into two tiger heads with soaring Slaughter Qi, and every time he blasted a fist, it was as if a ferocious monstrous white tiger with Slaughter Qi impacted, making people fall into fear.\"[Cloud Palm]!\" Yun Xiaodao complexion turned stiff, palms crossing each other, and a Fire Lightning Qi Aura from both of his palms gushed out. It transformed into a pair of giant palms crossing each other, and were warding in front of Yun Xiaodao.Chen Xiang's [White Tiger Divine Fist] struck that pair of giant crossed palms, and emitted \"BOOM\" sound one after another. The floor below also fiercely trembled, triggering storms one after another, blowing all around.At this time Chen Xiang's battle intent was rising, as he rarely met opponents with considerable strength. Rising high into the air with a leap, his palm swung downwards, and a explosive shout resounded. A huge fire palm suddenly appeared, about twenty zhang large, and fiercely pressing down.[Editor\u2019s Note: War Intention changed to Battle intent, we will change all future and past uses of war intentions with battle intent]This was Chen Xiang's killer move. It was to entirely release True Qi of only one attribute, transforming it into Qi Aura which could cause heavy casualties, and its range was also very wide!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 Equally matchedA huge fire palm appeared, and everyone could not help but exclaim in surprise. Yun Xiaodao's complexion turned solemn as he once again cast [Cloud Palm] towards the sky, resisting the pressure from the rapidly approaching fire palm.Yun Xiaodao's [Cloud Palm] also became large, about 10 zhang wide, as he released the vigorous True Qi of the 10th level Mortal Martial Realm. With great power, it even pushed up Chen Xiang's huge fire palm.Chen Xiang\u2019s \u2018hei hei\u2019 laughter sounded out, only to see Azure True Qi flas.h.i.+ng once again and surging out from his palm accompanied with fierce lightning. Along with his soft cry, a huge azure palm once again appeared, pressing down from above, and overlapped with that huge fire palm!The Fire and Lightning True Qi became even more violent and stronger after the fusion. Yun Xiaodao's [Cloud Palm] was utterly defeated in an instant, and Chen Xiang\u2019s huge fire and lightning palm continued to press down fiercely, smas.h.i.+ng Yun Xiaodao to the ground.BOOM BOOM BOOM..................A series of explosions burst out, and a huge palm seal appeared in the middle of the square as the Qi waves blew out in all directions. Every stone in its path was crushed, making an astonis.h.i.+ng palm imprint on the ground.Yun Xiaodao\u2019s whole body was pressed against the ground. He cried out loudly and leaped out from the middle of the palm seal; his entire body a mess. However, he had not suffered any serious injuries.\"Great brother Chen, your strength was out of my expectations. I'm now going to use my killer move.\" Yun Xiaodao said with a serious look on his face. Just as he finished speaking, Zhang De shouted, \"You're going to fight again. You'll ruin everything here; your strengths are just about same. If you still want to decide who is better, you'll definitely be mutually wounded.\"Chen Xiang also stopped as he heard Zhang De. He did not expect that after completely releasing two attributes of True Qi, he did not even defeat the other party. It was pretty clear that Yun Xiaodao\u2019s strength was in no way weak.\"Great brother Chen is only in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and he can already fight on par with me. In other words, if he reaches the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, wouldn't that mean I would lose?\" Yun Xiaodao sighed.\"This is just great. Another little monster has joined our martial courtyard.\" A middle-aged man said with a bitter smile. At the moment, these children at such a young age, were actually more formidable than them. Especially Chen Xiang, that kind of martial skill was very shocking and made their hearts shake in fear.\"Great brother Chen, you've killed many people, right? Just a moment ago your Slaughter Qi was very thick; it almost scared me.\" Yun Xiaodao asked with a curious look. Fear could be seen deep in his eyes.\"Not many. I don't remember how many, but all of them were people who came to find some trouble,\" said Chen Xiang.\"I should keep this in mind and trouble you less often in future.\" said Yun Xiaodao with a laugh.\"You two brats, take a look around. This place hasn\u2019t been ruined for many years but now............\"Zhang De\u2019s old face was full of helplessness.Yun Xiaodao laughed and said, \"Old man Zhang, I'm the main reason for this so I'll pay the crystal stones.\"Chen Xiang suddenly said, \"I have got to go and rest for a moment. My True Qi is not rich as yours. It is almost depleted.\"Chen Xiang wouldn't use Universal True Qi unless it was necessary. It was too lethal; moreover, he also didn't want to expose too much of his strength, but he was sure, even if he had won against Yun Xiaodao, he would also end up with serious injuries.Yun Xiaodao was indeed strong. Even after such an intense battle, he didn't consume much of his True Qi. Furthermore, he didn't even use his trump card.\"There are a lot of powerful experts in this Martial Courtyard! It really is a cradle for powerful experts!\" Chen Xiang while recovering his consumed True Qi in his room, sighed in his heart.Chen Xiang had just left the square. Disciples from some nearby Martial Courtyards were coming to ask about the situation. They were all amazed by the huge palm seal in the middle of the square. They all knew how strong these bricks were; it is very difficult to destroy them without applying great power.Two days pa.s.sed, and the Inner Sect a.s.sessment had begun to accept applications. Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao, and Zhang De went together to apply for the a.s.sessment as well.After registering, they left the Extreme Martial Sect. Together, they ate and drank in a hotel in Tianmen City, but their luck was not that good and saw Zhu Rong, that money grubbing stingy fatty. At last, they could only take Zhu Rong together with them.\"Little rascal Yun, I'll say this in advance, this meal is your treat!\" Zhu Rong said seriously while ordering the food.\"Why should I treat you?\" asked Yun Xiaodao. Although he was a local tyrant, he did not want to spend his money on Zhu Rong.\"Old man Zhang is old now; maybe he will still be farting in the Outer Sect. Chen Xiang has just entered the Extreme Martial Sect, and I'm a stingy fatty. Do you want all of us to leave right now? Besides, your Yun family is richer than my Zhu family.\" Zhu Rong said with a smile.Chen Xiang saw that Zhu Rong, Yun Xiaodao, and Zhang De had a very good relations.h.i.+p. Otherwise, he would not causally speak in such a way. Furthermore, he also knew Zhu Rong was once in the 330th Martial Courtyard, and was also once the strongest Outer Sect Disciple.\"Little pig, although this old man does not have grand ambitions from the True Martial Realm, but when I die, I will die as an Inner Sect Disciple, do not underestimate me.\" said Zhang De confidently.Yun Xiaodao pursed his lips and said, \"Wait for me to enter the Inner Sect, then I'll definitely grab your position, do as you please for now!\"This hotel was very busy, and many of the customers were rich kids, mostly the disciples of Extreme Martial Sect. They had a very low position in the Extreme Martial Sect, but outside, the majority of them had eyes above their heads, were arrogant, and acted as if the world was dancing around them and was solely venerating their appearance. Seeing this Yun Xiaodao secretly clenched his teeth, he couldn't wait to beat few of them to the ground.\"Little rascal Yun, you and younger brother Chen together might be able to get rid that b.a.s.t.a.r.d, but if it is you alone, then you will come back crawling.\" Zhu Rong said while looking at a man on a nearby table.When that man looked at others, his eyes always had a squinted appearance, looking with endless contempt and arrogance. As long as others came in contact with that kind of expression in his eyes, they will all feel uncomfortable.Chen Xiang didn't want to stir up some trouble; he feared that Yun Xiaodao would truly do something so he quickly said, \"Okay, after entering the Inner Sect, you'll have the opportunity to fight with him.\"Chen Xiang speculated that man must be from the Inner Sect.\"Humph! Depending on you? Coming from a secular world, do not think that it is easy to advance to the Inner Sect,\" said that man while shaking his head and laughing scornfully.\"f.u.c.king b.a.s.t.a.r.d, this father can not wait to poke your eyes and stamp them.\" Yun Xiaodao slapped the table and cursed. He was about to rush forward but was pulled by Zhu Rong and Zhang De.\"A private fight, do you want to be expelled from the Extreme Martial Sect?\" Zhang De said hastily.Chen Xiang calmly continued, \"If I can enter the Inner Sect, how about you give me 100 True Qi Dans? In return, if I can not enter, I'll give you 100!\"\"Only 100? Too little, how about 1000? Squinted snake, you dare to bet?\" Yun Xiaodao yelled.\"The a.s.sessment is only a few days away, so I am willing to bet, but if it were ten years later, I would not even dare to bet.\" That man said.\"In a few days later, great brother Chen will definitely enter the Inner Sect!\" Yun Xiaodao said excitedly. Chen Xiang, however, was depressed, as he currently did not have 1000 True Qi Dans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 Revealed PowerZhu Rong patted Chen Xiang's shoulder and said, \"Rest a.s.sured, these True Qi Dans will be paid for by that little rascal Yun when the time arrives. I'll sell them to him, ha ha........\"\"Dead pig, are you saying that Chen Xiang will definitely lose?\" Yun Xiaodao said with contempt in his eyes as he looked at Zhu Rong.\"Since it is a bet, I can not say for sure. But if he does win, I'm willing to buy those True Qi Dans since you won\u2019t be able to use all of them.\" Zhu Rong laughed.\"Fart, if he does win I would rather feed them to dogs then give them to you.\" Yun Xiaodao cursed.Chen Xiang and Zhang De could only remain silent as they listened to Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rong bickering. Moreover, Chen Xiang couldn't help but admire these two, as they continued to curse each other without losing their breathes while they all ate and drank.After returning to the Martial Courtyard, Chen Xiang asked in a confused voice, \"Strange, why haven't I seen any female disciples around?\"\"In the Extreme Martial Sect, there are no females. It is probably due to the fact that the Extreme Martial Sect's Ancestor had no interest in women, and thus established this rule. d.a.m.n, this stupid rule is hurting us. In fact, most disciples of the Extreme Martial Sect bring their woman, or else they can only endure it through self-reliance....\" Yun Xiaodao said with a grin on his face, \"Great brother Chen, you're not staying in the Martial Courtyard every night are you?\"\"Of course,\" Chen Xiang said after thinking for a moment. He now understood why Tianmen City was always so lively. It appears that all the rich kids have brought their families with them there.\"You are an honest man great brother Chen. Only the type of people like old man Zhang can honestly stay in the Martial Courtyard.\" Yun Xiaodao let out a depraved laugh and soon left.The sky turned dark as Chen Xiang returned to his room. He was refining True Qi Dans. Meanwhile, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were afraid to come out of the ring because they feared that the strong experts in the area, who were as numerous as clouds, would sense them.\"Sister Meiyao, the Extreme Martial Sect does not accept any female disciples, and you made Leng Youlan to come here. Seriously!?\" Chen Xiang had originally thought that he could take care of Leng Youlan in the Extreme Martial Sect.\"Humph, It's been a long time since then, how am I supposed to remember these little things?\" Su Meiyao said with a low snort. When Chen Xiang was out today, he brought back some exquisite dresses and beautiful jewelry for Su Meiyao and Bai YouyouIn just a few days Chen Xiang had adjusted to his new lifestyle in the Extreme Martial Sect and in the Martial Courtyard, and formed good relations with his senior disciples. He was fortunate to come to a harmonious Martial Courtyard where he didn\u2019t have to entangle with scheming people every day.In the Extreme Martial Sect there was one very huge square which could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people. Every month, Elders from the Elder Courtyard would discourse in the plaza as such, most of the disciples would gather there on such an occasion. Today was the annual Inner Sect a.s.sessment, the most important event of the year. As long as they were Outer Sect Disciples , they had the qualification to sign up.Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao, and Zhang De came in together as a team, ready to accept their first a.s.sessment. They were the team of disciples from the 330th Martial Courtyard. Upon seeing them, the disciples of the other Martial Courtyards silently made way, not daring to provoke them.\"Great brother Chen, have you heard about that Fang Liang you incapacitated earlier? It seems that it will take him a year and a half to recover completely. By the looks of it, that Fang Family and you will wind up fighting each other.\" Yun Xiaodao said with a laugh.Chen Xiang could only helplessly sigh; it could be said that he started lightly. Otherwise, he would have undoubtedly crippled Fang Liang. But he knew that the families here and that of the secular world were different. The families here had true martial experts to rely upon!The first a.s.sessment was to test a disciples strength, and if one does not pa.s.s the test, they would be eliminated.Strength was tested by punching a pre-established array. This array was arranged on a stone wall and looked similar to a small pool of water. After a punch had landed, it would show the corresponding value that represented a measure of strength. Only upon reaching a certain value, would one be said to have pa.s.sed.\"The first test is simple; we can pa.s.s it anytime.\" Zhang De said.\"The second and third tests are more difficult. I was eliminated in the second test, and old man Zhang is the same. He did not pa.s.s the second a.s.sessment as well!\" Yun Xiaodao said with a face filled with helplessness.\"What is the second test about?\" Chen Xiang asked as he didn't know anything about the second and the third tests.Speaking about it, a sliver of fear flashed past Yun Xiaodao\u2019s eyes, \"Elder Dan personally conducts the second test. It is mainly used to test the endurance while the third is an integrated test. Every year it is different but equally challenging.\"Elder Dan was the Extreme Martial Sect's 2nd strongest person and was also the only female in Extreme Martial Sect. Rumors say that her rank was higher that the Current Extreme Martial Dean and was in charge of the Extreme Martial Courtyard. n.o.body knows her real name, and thus she was only referred as Elder Dan.\"It's my turn; don\u2019t know if I can break my old record once again.\" Yun Xiaodao rolled up his sleeves and said with an expression which stated that he was looking forward to it.Chen Xiang was ranked behind Yun Xiaodao, and also wanted to take a look at Yun Xiaodao's strongest blow. Only the disciples with a value exceeding 1000 were allowed to pa.s.s, and many Outer Sect Disciples could only reach about 600, some could even reach 700, but there weren't many who could achieve it. From this, one could tell that the Extreme Martial Outer Sect Disciples strength was very uniform.Yun Xiaodao blasted a fist against that pool of water on the stone wall. The arm submerged entirely. When he took out his hand, a single value appeared on that calm pool of water.\"2300!\"Seeing this numeral digit, everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air as the previous highest record was only 1800!\"Great brother Chen, your turn!\" Yun Xiaodao appeared to be very satisfied with his performance as he patted Chen Xiang's shoulder.Chen Xiang could also be considered to have a little reputation in the Outer Sect. He had come from the secular world. Furthermore, he had seriously injured Fang Laing with a single blow. He also had good relations with Zhu Rong and was an alchemist.\u201cUse all of your power! Only by showing your strength can one be respected! Well\u2026 it should be alright as long as you do not expose the Yin and Yang Divine Vein!\u201d Bai Youyou ordered in a high pitch tone.Chen Xiang nodded his head in response. In his dantian, all five elements of True Qi fused together, forming the Universal True Qi. He then took a long deep breath and fiercely blasted a punch. At that moment, he did not release any hint of True Qi, which made everyone extremely confused, because if one didn't use True Qi, their strength would be greatly reduced.This time around, Chen Xiang used all of his strength. He was sure that if a mountain were to be struck by his blow, it would be destroyed. However, when his strike entered into the array on the stone wall, it remained very calm.He was secretly shocked by the strength of this mysterious array. Something of this quality was difficult to arrange by the people of the secular world.Chen Xiang punched out, only to see the emergence of a number above the pool of water.Upon seeing this value, the noisy square immediately became deadly quiet. Everyone\u2019s face was filled with horror. The first idea that went through their minds was that there was a problem with the array. However, they quickly dismissed this idea because it had never happened before.4800.Even for an Inner Sect Disciple it was hard to get this value. Furthermore, this value was double that of Yun Xiaodao\u2019s!The old man responsible for supervising the tests was also surprised. He was a True Martial Realm pract.i.tioner, and when Chen Xiang had punched the array, he sensed a powerful invisible True Qi through some hints, but he couldn't recognize what type of True Qi it was.That old man, however, could be considered quite experienced as he immediately shouted. \u201cChen Xiang, a score of 4800, pa.s.s!\u201dHearing those words, the entire square exploded into commotion like a large pot of boiling water. An Outer Sect Disciple was capable of getting the same value as that of an Elite Inner Sect Disciple! This was simply too incredible, and made it hard for others to believe their eyes!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 Dan Elder[TLN: We\u2019ll be using elder brother instead of great brother, apparently it is not flowing well according to my editors.]Chen Xiang was also scared as his saw the value on the array, but after some thought, he calmed down. He was cultivating all five elements of True Qi, and the Universal True Qi was formed by fusing all five elements of True Qi, and so it was no surprise that his strength had been elevated by many times.\"Elder brother Chen, you're scary, and you're very cunning. The last time we compared notes, you did not use your whole strength!\" Yun Xiaodao exclaimed.Zhu Rong\u2019s complexion was also somewhat strange. He thought about his previous guesses of Chen Xiang entering the Inner Sect, but now his chances were great, at least no one in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm could beat his record.\"Hei hei.. that squinted b.a.s.t.a.r.d is definitely going to lose!\" Yun Xiaodao said with a laugh as he thought of the gamble with deep stakes in his mind.Many disciples were partic.i.p.ating in the a.s.sessment, and it took the entire day, from early morning to late night to finish the a.s.sessment. In the morning, the whole square was filled with people, but now there were no more than 300 people. Chen Xiang now knew how hard it was to enter the Inner Sect, as so many disciples were eliminated in the first a.s.sessment itself!The first test came to an end, and the disciples of the Martial Courtyard were sure that Chen Xiang could definitely pa.s.s. They didn't have much confidence to face the second test, and a shadow of doubt had formed in their hearts as many of them had always been repeatedly eliminated during the second a.s.sessment.\"It is late at night, yet they want to conduct the second a.s.sessment?\" Chen Xiang asked doubtfully as they couldn't leave even after pa.s.sing their first a.s.sessment.\"That is natural, all three a.s.sessment are going to be conducted one after the another. Sometimes they will even last several days, and you cannot even rest in between.\" Yun Xiaodao replied.Everyone stood in the middle of the square waiting for the arrival of Elder Dan so that they could start the next a.s.sessment.Late at night, silver moonlight s.h.i.+ned on the square while the cool breeze was occasionally blowing, making people feel very comfortable and relaxed.Suddenly, everyone felt very hot and stuffy, as if a heavy downpour had begun, but as they raised their heads and looked at the skies, they still able to see the stars in the clear sky.Just as everyone looked towards the skies, a person suddenly appeared before their eyes shocking everyone.\"Elder Dan!\" All 300 disciples and the ones responsible for conducting the test saluted in respect.Elder Dan wore a long white skirt, and had beautiful ebony long hair, but Chen Xiang was disappointed by the fact that a black mask covered her face. It covered her entire face, revealing only her two eyes, but a fiery red aura was surging in those eyes.\"You do not need to be overly courteous.\" said Elder Dan as she raised her hand.Her voice sounded lazy yet cold, and was filled with a kind world turning momentum. This made Chen Xiang think that she was somewhat similar to the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire's Empress.Chen Xiang suddenly felt this masked Elder Dan gave him a familiar feeling, but he could not pinpoint who she resembled.\"She definitely is not Xianxian's teacher. Her voice is not so cold, and it doesn't even match her,\" Chen Xiang thought in his heart removing that possibility.Elder Dan took a few sheets and quickly scanned through the recorded content of the previous a.s.sessment. As she finished scanning them, she said in a cold voice, \"Not bad, the values this year is very high and there is also one with a value of 4800!\"Although her voice sounded very cold and lacked any emotions, it was evident from her voice that she was also surprised.Chen Xiang felt that this kind of chilly tone was absolutely not natural. Strange, like it is deliberately manufactured, because he and Bai Youyou had been staying together for a long time. That was why he knew how a genuine cold beauty was like, like Bai Youyou's cold voice sounded very natural.\"Chen Xiang come out!\" Elder Dan shouted, that cold voice was like an explosion in the ear, and everyone's entire body trembled, while their ears were buzzing.Chen Xiang stood and came out, with neither overbearingness nor servility replied, \"Disciple Chen Xiang!\"\"Humph, do not think with your little ability you can swagger before others. I heard as soon as you came you settled some things.Moreover in the secular world you were also not very law-abiding. For someone like you, it is best to tempered in the Outer Sect first then enter Inner Sect, so as to avoid bigger issue in the Inner Sect! Are you sure you want to partic.i.p.ate in the second a.s.sessment?\" Elder Dan\u2019s words made everyone inwardly shocked, as everybody could see that Elder Dan seemed to be intentionally against Chen Xiang!What type of character was Elder Dan? She was the next strongest after the Extreme Martial Dean, and also was an alchemist! Such a character was against him, and it was clear that later Chen Xiang was going to eat a lot of suffering in the Extreme Martial Sect!\"I want to partic.i.p.ate in the second a.s.sessment!\" Chen Xiang's brow slightly wrinkled, but with a deadpan look replied, \"What I did in the secular world, I think it was the correct way!\"\"Humph!\" Dan Elder coldly spoke, \"You go to other end of the square, when I say, you can start walking!\"Dan Elder threw these words, flew into the sky, floating at the other end of the square, and her speed made everyone in their heart to gasped from shock.Chen Xiang just a moment ago knew how the test was going to be performed, and that was to walk from one end of the square to another under a kind of pressure. If one was able to reach the other end it could be considered pa.s.sing the second a.s.sessment.The giant square was more that 300 zhang wide, walking past it was very easy, and if one used Qing Gong, then it was even faster!300 Outer Sect Disciples lined up, standing in a line, and waited for the Elder Dan at the opposite end to issue the command.\"Chen Xiang you should remain where you're, you will be tested alone!\" These words of Elder Dan made Chen Xiang have a bad feeling, he secretly regret obeying Bai Youyou, and completely exposed his own strength.At this time Chen Xiang determined that Elder Dan was intentionally against him, and he knew later on he was going to eat bitterness. He was suspecting whether or not there was any relation between Elder Dan and the Yao family, even to grant 'special attention' to a minion.\"Elder brother Chen, take care! I'll be waiting for you in the Inner Sect.\" Yun Xiaodao said gloomily, sounding full of helplessness, because he knew for Chen Xiang it was not possible for him to enter Inner Sect in few years.\"Start!\" Elder Dan shouted, and though separated by hundreds of zhang, her transmitted voice was absolutely clear.Also at this time, Chen Xiang sensed an invisible mighty pressure befall, and people could not help but bend their knees, as if they were carrying a giant mountain on their shoulders.\"Those who can not hold, as long as they shout 'Give up', I'll immediately send him out of the square.\" Elder Dan spoke coldly.Chen Xiang in his heart secretly cursed, because he was now withstanding this kind same pressure, but he had to once again partic.i.p.ate in the test. Obviously this showed that Elder Dan was really 'looking after' him!Not long after the a.s.sessment started, many disciples fell on the ground, vomiting blood and directly gave up. They were directly removed from the strengthened square.It was the first time for Chen Xiang to see such a formidable expert to act, and be able to release this kind of power casually. Not to mention ordinary people, even these 9th and 10th level Mortal Martial Realm martial artists, in the eyes of Elder Dan, were simply ants.Chen Xiang had no doubt, so long as Elder Dan was willing, she could kill him casually with one look!This is the strength of a martial artist standing at the peak of the Mortal Martial World!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 Does Not Give UpAt the forefront was Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De. However, they were both walking with extreme difficulty, each and every step was very difficult to take and was also extremely heavy. Behind them, there had been originally around 300 disciples but now barely 100 remained.The entire square was littered with bloodstains. Each was from the blood spat out from disciples who couldn\u2019t endure.More than half an hour past and Chen Xiang was sweating badly. Although he hadn\u2019t moved, the pressure he was under is not small. Now the only people walking in the square was ten or so.Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De, the youth and old man were walking in the front. But blood was already overflowing from their mouths, their whole body was also sweating buckets. This endurance test was really fearsome.Chen Xiang had once heard Yun Xiaodao say that over the many years, the large majority haven\u2019t ever pa.s.sed the second a.s.sessment!A little time pa.s.sed by as Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De reached only 10 Zhang away from Elder Dan. Yet each step they now took was extremely difficult, it was as if their foot weighed 10,000,000 Jin.Zhang De became unable to bear the pressure and kneeled on the ground. He spat out a mouthful of blood, but even while kneeling he was still, like before, gradually and slowly moving forward. He had already stayed in the Outer Sect for far too long. Receiving the taunts of so many, yet now here he was, only a step away from pa.s.sing the second a.s.sessment. There is no way he would give up!Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De were always eliminated at this test. That\u2019s why they were well aware of its level of difficulty and that's why they were completely certain that after the \u201cSpecial Care\u201d provided Chen Xiang, it would be hopeless for him to pa.s.s the test!Although Yun Xiaodao was only 16 years old, he was more formidable than Zhang De. He was actually able to walk through and came up behind Elder Dan. The pressure suddenly disappeared as he fell down onto the ground. Panting and struggling to gulp down more air, he quickly swallowed a pill for swift recovery because there was an even more formidable third a.s.sessment coming up!\u201cOld man Zhang, hold on!\u201d Yun Xiaodao clenched both of his fists and shouted. He knew this type of hards.h.i.+p, he understood the depth of the desire to pa.s.s through this a.s.sessment.\u201cAHHHHHH!\u201d A long and loud roar resounded. Finally, using his knees to walk, Old man Zhang arrived to the other end of the square. At the same time, many others had chosen to drop down and give up, because of this, they were seriously injured.Among the 300 disciples that started this test, only two were able to pa.s.s the a.s.sessment! Chen Xiang had been standing behind them all, he saw with his own eyes how much despair and helplessness was present on those disciples when they choose to give up and leave!Now only Chen Xiang was left to begin the test. n.o.body could understand why Elder Dan would be so biased towards Chen Xiang. Although how Chen Xiang handled the matter was rather surprising, they also believed that he had no other choice!\u201cChen Xiang it\u2019s your turn! You still have the option to give up. Otherwise you will definitely suffer excruciating pain and might also ruin your future cultivation!\u201d Elder Dan sounded extremely cold. It was very difficult for anyone to understand why she hated Chen Xiang so much. After all, Chen Xiang was just a minor character, why would a famous person from the Chenwu Mainland hate him?Chen Xiang himself didn\u2019t know how he offended this mysterious Elder Dan.\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up!\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s voice was firm and powerful, spreading out in all directions. At the same time, every genius thought, Chen Xiang had also been subjected to the exact same pressure they had been, yet he is still upright, standing with a straight back. They simply could not compare with this kind of strength.There were still many disciples in the square who hadn\u2019t left. There were also True Martial Realm experts, these were the Inner Sect Disciples. The Outer Sect Disciples who had just failed the a.s.sessment also wanted to see how Elder Dan was going to treat Chen Xiang.\u201cThen\u2026 Let\u2019s begin!\u201d Elder Dan replied in a low voice.After her statement ended, everyone felt a burst of scorching Qi waves surge in the square. What made everyone startled the most, was how those thick and strong giant bricks in the square began to resemble the sea and started heaving up and down.It was immediately followed by a severe tremor, it was as if the whole Extreme Martial Sect was shaking. Those thick bricks in the square transformed into powder from that giant tremor!The next scene made everyone suck in a deep cold breath. These special bricks were actually turned into powder in the blink of an eye! What was totally unexpected was that below those bricks, there was another layer of metal like material that looked far more st.u.r.dy.An old man picked up a brick and threw it into the square. In the blink of an eye, that brick was transformed into powder. This kind of pressure was far stronger compared to what Yun Xiaodao underwent, and in addition to that, it was also extremely hot.\u201cIf you can arrive behind my back, then you have pa.s.sed this a.s.sessment!\u201dElder Dan hadn\u2019t taken a single step, but instead transformed the entire square into a sea of lava in the blink of an eye.Chen Xiang was sweating more and more. He could feel that the current pressure was at least several times stronger compared with the previous one, and was far more terrifying.Everyone was holding their breath as they looked at Chen Xiang. His body was burnt by the flames, his robes were not able to withstand the scorching True Qi released by Elder Dan. In the blink of an eye, they were instantly burnt into ashes.But for Chen Xiang, this did not matter. To the crowd\u2019s surprise, he was able to withstand such high temperatures. Furthermore, he also released flames that s.h.i.+elded his body.Chen Xiang\u2019s fine strong muscles were now burning red. Although the pressure had increased, his back still remained tall and straight. His eyes were still clear as he stared straight at the burning pupils of the far away Elder Dan.Chen Xiang took a step as his whole body fiercely shook. The metal floor he stepped upon was very hot, but due to him cultivating the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise], he was able to withstand this type of scorching heat.Seeing Chen Xiang begin to walk, everyone watching was deeply moved. Even under such a scenario, Chen Xiang was still able to move. It must be known that even the Inner Sect Disciples watching were afraid to try it! Plus, Chen Xiang was just an Outer Sect Disciple, and was also only at the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.Chen Xiang walked very slowly because each step was extremely difficult to take. He had to spend nearly all of his True Qi to support his body. This was the Universal True Qi, even so, it was still extremely difficult for him.Half an hour past as each and every step from Chen Xiang was clearly seen by everyone. Although in reality, it was just a short distance, for Chen Xiang it seemed as if he had been walking for more than 100 years.\u201cHumph!\u201d The Elder Dan coldly snorted as Chen Xiang spat out a mouthful of blood. Everyone could see that Elder Dan had increased the pressure.This was very unfair, but although everyone had this thought in their mind, they did not voice it out loud. They knew that Chen Xiang could not walk until the end, however they still admired Chen Xiang. This was because although he clearly knew the road would be nearly impossible, he still did not give up. Clenching his teeth, he once again began to move forward.Time flowed slowly, each step from Chen Xiang shook everyone's soul. Each time Chen Xiang took a step, the crowd expected him to fall right after. Yet Chen Xiang defied their expectations each and every time, refusing to fall. He took one step after another, each time spitting out a mouthful of blood. As the blood fell on the metal tiles beneath him, it instantly evaporated into thin air.\u201cI said that you must stay in the Outer Sect to temper yourself. You must be obedient and abide, stay there! I will not let you pa.s.s through the second a.s.sessment!\u201d To everyone\u2019s surprise, Elder Dan\u2019s voice was trembling. Apparently, she was very angry and also didn\u2019t expect Chen Xiang to be capable of arriving in front of her.Immediately after her voice was transmitted, Chen Xiang emitted a horrible shriek as both of his knees touched the ground. Elder Dan was determined to not allow Chen Xiang to pa.s.s as she once again increased the level of pressure.\u201cAlthough\u2026, \u2026 Although I do not know why you\u2019re doing this to me. I will never give in to you. I will definitely pa.s.s through this second a.s.sessment\u2026\u201d Chen Xiang suddenly let out a low laugh and spoke in a low tone.The square was dead silent and everyone could hear his declaration very clearly.After Chen Xiang vomited a large amount of blood, he once again stood up to everyone\u2019s surprise, only to see him then shout loudly, \u201cI can die, but I will never bow to you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 SuicidalNever going to surrender! This was what Chen Xiang kept telling himself in his heart, and Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao also didn't say anything, and they seemed to be acquiesce with Chen Xiang doing this dangerous thing, at the same time the were also deeply shocked by this indomitable spirit of Chen Xiang's.\"Humph, human are like ants!\" Elder Dan\u2019s voice was as if she was clenching her teeth, and it sounded like she was now angry.Chen Xiang just walked no more than a few steps, he once again fell down, this time he was lying on the ground, from his whole body blood was gus.h.i.+ng out.\"Did you not also came from an ant? Someday, I, this ant, will definitely transcend you.\" Chen Xiang clenched his and said. Although he sounded very weak, but anyone listening could sense it was full of pride.Chen Xiang could not stand up, but he was still crawling bit by bit.\"Elder brother Chen..............\"Yun Xiaodao looked at Chen Xiang, his eyes were moist, and he then remembered just because it was too difficult to bear he gave up, but Chen Xiang wanted to pa.s.s through this second a.s.sessment so he was now fighting with his life. He just does not want to bow to this strong woman, even if he was an ant.\"Elder brother Chen, you'll definitely be able to come, hold on!\" Yun Xiaodao originally believed Chen Xiang didn't stand a chance, but he hadn't expected Chen Xiang could persist and arrive here, so he could not help himself and shouted.\"Chen Xiang, enter the Inner Sect with us together, if I this old man had this kind of perseverance, then I would not still be staying in the Outer Sect for so long!\" Zhang De was also infected by Chen Xiang.\"Chen Xiang, hold on! You can do it!\" One man in the square loudly shouted.Looking at Chen Xiang slowly crawling bit by bit on that scorching ground, and watching the blood evaporate from his body, everyone was deeply shocked.\"Chen Xiang..........Chen Xiang................Chen Xiang\" In the square hundreds of people shouted in unison, their sound resounded through the sky, and in the middle of the night the Extreme Martial Sect was shrouded with these blood seething sounds.Listening to everyone's high-pitched voices, Chen Xiang's blood began to boil. He operated the few remaining True Qi, and struggled to crawl forward. His body was devastated and numb due to various kinds of pain, and now all of his perseverance was supporting him to crawl!Elder Dan's tender body was trembling, as she did not expect that so many people would support Chen Xiang in front of her, which was simply contradicting her!\"Do not struggle, ants will be ants!\" Elder Dan\u2019s voice was full of rage, because Chen Xiang was only two steps away from her.\"Ah------------\" Chen Xiang suddenly let out a horrible shriek, only to see blood suddenly bursting out from both of his legs and arms, apparently Elder Dan has intentionally once again enhanced the pressure.This was simply avenging personal enmity using public affairs, but Elder Dan was the No. 2 character in the Extreme Martial Sect, no one would dare to contradict her!\"This time I'll see how you will walk!\" Elder Dan let loose a deep breath, and not only the firm and resolute expression in Chen Xiang's eyes were making her unhappy, but Chen Xiang to her surprise had also not give up.\"Ha ha ha.............\" Chen Xiang to everyone's surprise loudly laughed. He was only two steps away, that was not only the gateway to third a.s.sessment, but also the outcome between him and Elder Dan.Although he was far inferior to Elder Dan, but here he must definitely win against Elder Dan!\"This father will never surrender to you!\" Chen Xiang loudly laughed, and suddenly he let out a loud shout, only to see flames suddenly gus.h.i.+ng out from his back, while a pair of giant wings arppeared on his back.Those wings swiftly flapped, scorching fire waves one after another started gus.h.i.+ng out, and Chen Xiang's body started to rise. All of this happened in the blink of an eye, however, in that small instant, Chen Xiang's battered body was already behind Elder Dan.Elder Dan was shocked, and so was everyone else.Chen Xiang actually had a True Qi Wing type Martial Skill which was a very precious and rare martial skill! In the most crucial moment, it let Chen Xiang leap the last two steps, making him pa.s.s through the second a.s.sessment!\"Ha ha ha...........This father is through the second a.s.sessment, ha ha ha ha...........\" There was not a little bit of strength left in Chen Xiang's whole body, and he was lying on the ground, looking at the moon in the sky, while letting out a crazy laugh one after another.Everyone in the square was speechless, and listening to Chen Xiang\u2019s maniac laughter, not only in their hearts were they shocked, but at the same time they were also excited, envied him, and admired him......................\"Do not laugh, there is still the third a.s.sessment.\" Yun Xiaodao wiped the tears in his eyes, and stuffed a bunch of dans into his mouth, and Chen Xiang, in the an instant, could distinguish that these were all Low-Grade Spirit Level Dan, there was a bunch of True Qi Dans for recovering his True Qi, Nine Recovering Dans which were quickly healing his internal injuries.........This moved Chen Xiang's heart.\"This is the White Jade Dan, take it and use it!\" Zhu Rong came and threw him a jade box.Middle-Grade Spirit Level White Jade Dan, this was a very precious healing dan, and the stingy Zhu Rong was actually willing to give him. Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao were looking at him with an incredible expression in their eyes.\"Do not thank me!\" Zhu Rong proudly said.Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De also quickly smeared the herbal powder in the jade box on Chen Xiang's body. This herbal powder was similar to white jade; crystal clear and very beautiful.\"Elder Dan, disciple with great courage asks you, why must you be dead set against me? Do you like to avenge personal vendettas using public means!\" It was impossible not to have anger in Chen Xiang's heart. Just a moment ago he was kind of presumptuous in front of Elder Dan, and was also fearless.\"I made it very clear, you are young and fit, I just want you to sharpen yourself in the Outer Sect!\" Elder Dan actually had not been angry, but at this moment, she was unable to say anything again.\"Avenge personal enmity using public means? So what if it I am? I have the strength, so I can do whatever I want. Also, the Extreme Martial Sect can not bind me, those rules are only established for you!\" Elder Dan said with disdain, \"You want justice? Strength is justice, and as long as I want, I can kill you now. No one will say anything to me, and also no one will take revenge for you!\"\"Indeed, you can do this, but some things aren't absolute, just like how I was able to pa.s.s through the second a.s.sessment and you weren\u2019t able to stop me!\" Chen Xiang said while sneering, \"But someday I'll get back to you! You better kill me now.\"Zhang De and Yun Xiaodao were smearing medicine on Chen Xiang, but their hands could not help but tremble. They totally had not expected Chen Xiang would actually dare to talk back to number 2 character of the Extreme Martial Sect!Elder Dan burst into laughter, but her laughter was very stiff, and not very natural, making everyone who heard a little confused.\"Good, Good! I'd like to see up to what extent you'll grow? I promise you, as long as one day you can beat me, you can do whatever you want to punish me, if you want to marry me you also can!\" Elder Dan spoke loudly, once again making people dazed.Chen Xiang was also very much surprised, however he teasingly said, \"I'll not bother to marry you, you face is always covered in a mask, maybe it is disfigured, at that time I'll suffer!\"Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De very much wanted to sew Chen Xiang's mouth together. One after another he was actually speaking these kind of words as if he didn\u2019t want to live, and Zhu Rong also went far away, fearing Elder Dan will suddenly explode and if he would also be affected.\"You do not want to live?\" Elder Dan voice was extremely cold.\"If I wanted to live, I would have already fled before. Look at me. Does it look like the type of person who wants to live?\" Chen Xiang replied like he did not want to live.\"Do you think I cannot kill you?\" Elder Dan stepped forward, and purple flames gushed out from her slender and beautiful hands.Seeing the purple flame, Chen Xiang, in his heart, was greatly startled. He heard Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou speaking, and only those who possess a Fire Spirit could release purple flames.\"Come on then. So that after this I won\u2019t not have to marry you, an ugly girl, and you also will not have to marry this boy wet behind the ears after this...................\" Chen Xiang could not finish his sentence, his mouth was covered by Yun Xiaodao.Elder Dan received the flames in her hand, and said coldly, \"What I said before, I'll certainly keep my promise, as long as you beat me, I'll marry you, and at that time I'll be at your disposal.\"\"And............my appearance does not have much of difference with your fiancee, Xue Xianxian!\" Elder Dan finished speaking, flew and left.Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De were stunned, while Zhu Rong immediately rushed over, both of his hands grabbing Chen Xiang's shoulder, and with a look of disbelief he asked, \"Xue Xianxian was really your fiancee?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 Mysterious RealmChen Xiang curled his lips and said, \"You heard what that woman said a moment ago? Besides I already told you earlier, she is my fiancee!\"Xue Xianxian's name in the martial arts sects of Chenwu Mainland had reverberated like lightning because at the age of only 15, she was already a True Martial Realm martial artist!These days Chen Xiang also found out that he himself had fallen behind Xue Xianxian by a large margin.\"b.a.s.t.a.r.d..........b.a.s.t.a.r.d, such a good girl, how is she willing to marry someone like you?\"Zhu Rong looked jealous and shook Chen Xiang's body, and anyone could see he really wanted to hit Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang\u2019s injuries were much better now. After Elder Dan was gone, everyone else came to Chen Xiang\u2019s side, and inquired about his well being. The expression in their eyes when they looked at Chen Xiang was also full of respect, and spoke things such as if there was an opportunity to get some advice and so on.Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De were the only ones who could enter the third a.s.sessment, and although there was an age difference between each of them, they were very good friends, so they only hoped that the third a.s.sessment would not be sparring with each other, as that was too brutal for them.At this time Chen Xiang controlled his breathing, rested for about half an hour, and then thought in the end who Elder Dan was.\"Meiyao sister, Youyou sister, do you have any clue?\" asked Chen Xiang.\"No, but it is not necessary that you know this woman. You should know trying to understand a woman's heart is very difficult. It may be because of only one look in your eyes, or something about your behavior that gave her a bad impression and she hated you, or maybe she really was good to you and wanted you to stay in the Outer Sect?\" replied Su Meiyao.\"This woman\u2019s strength is not bad, and she actually has a Fire Spirit! If I'm not wrong, it should be the Purple Moon Fire Spirit.\" said bai Youyou.\"Yes, it must be the Purple Moon Fire Spirit, and according to legends, the moon suddenly became purple and the aura it emitted shone on the land of the mortal world. That land was engulfed by the purple flames, and was incinerated for 7-7-49 ten thousand years (490,000). Only after that fire was extinguished did that land in the mortal world then have life, flowers, gra.s.ses, and trees born out various kinds of life! At that time a fire of life was also bred out and it was known as the Purple Moon Fire Spirit, but this is the legends of the Purple Moon World! Does this woman come from the Purple Moon World?\" said Su Meiyao.[TLN: 7-7-49, the number 49, square of seven is used in chinese folks, taoist and buddhist rituals. For eg, it is believed a recently deceased spirit will linger in the living world for 49 days, so a second requiem is always performed at the end of 49 days. similarly, many rituals are required the performer to undergo a 49-day cleansing, fasting etc.]Chen Xiang had not expected one Fire Spirit to actually have so much history, and he secretly determined Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had once travelled many worlds.\"I do not know. Wait for me to get married to her. Later on I'll ask her and then we'll know.\" Chen Xiang said with a depraved smile.\"G.o.d knows how many years we would have to wait, this woman could be in the Nirvana Realm, which is the top most existence in the mortal world.\" said Su Meiyao.After restoring his injuries, Chen Xiang was pleasantly surprised to find his body had become a lot stronger, but it was also very clear his True Qi was enhanced. After getting tossed around, his True Qi was compressed, and its quality was enhanced by several times.Within a short period of time, the elevation was so distinct, which made Chen Xiang secretly shocked, and he began to suspect that Elder Dan may not really be malicious, but just wanted to sharpen him. It was just that her way of doing things was too strict and extreme.\"Wait for me to enter Inner Sect again and be admitted in the Extreme Dan Courtyard. At that time I can enjoy two kinds of treatment!\" Chen Xiang decided, and he was suddenly curious about Elder Dan. In order to have contact with her, he could only go to the Extreme Dan Courtyard, because Elder Dan was the head of the Extreme Dan Courtyard.Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De were lead by Zhu Rong to the innermost region of the Extreme Martial Sect, and Chen Xiang and the others could see courtyards of various sizes\"The 99th Inner Sect Martial Courtyard, is where we're going?\" Yun Xiaodao, looking at a numerical engraving, exclaimed.\"We're going to the Elder Courtyard! I also went there during my third a.s.sessment.\" Zhu Rong patted his round belly, and there was a eery smile on his face, \"The third a.s.sessment is not as frightening as second a.s.sessment, but it is still quite difficult, but after pa.s.sing through there will be many benefits.\"To their surprise they had to go to the Elder Courtyard, the residential area of all the elders of the Extreme Martial Sect, which made Chen Xiang and the others to feel a lot of pressure. Chen Xiang was also worried that because of his conflict with Elder Dan, this may have caused the whole Elder Courtyard to be against him, then he really would not be able to mix in the Extreme Martial Sect anymore.\"The Extreme Martial Dean went into closed-door training for many years, and now all the affairs are managed by Elder Wu. Elder Dan is always kind of elusive, and throughout the year will not appear even once to give lectures.\" said Zhu Rong, \"The Elder Wu is responsible for third a.s.sessment.\"Elder Wu was number 3 character in the Extreme Martial Sect. He was very harmonious and amicable, and although his cultivation was very high and remote, he did not have even a little bit of arrogance. Many disciples liked him, which made Chen Xiang and the others to let loose a deep breath, as at least they did not have to face someone moody like Elder Dan, this strange woman.\"This is the Elder Courtyard? It really is a little different.\" Yun Xiaodao didn't expect that there actually would be a paradise \u4e16\u5916\u6843\u6e90 here in the Extreme Martial Sect. There were not any kind of buildings here, but instead there were mountains and lakes, with a very vast prairie and although it was now night, but a bright moon and many star lights were s.h.i.+ning here. The scenery here was very beautiful.[TLN: \u4e16\u5916\u6843\u6e90 imaginary land of joy and plenty, in other words, paradise, Shangri-la so and so]\"Why can I not see this type of scenery from the outside? Moreover it looks like it is bigger here than Tianmen City in the outside!\" said Chen Xiang with some doubt.\"Ha ha ha, this is one Mysterious Realm, and one can only see the inside things when they are near it, but if you're looking from far, it will be blocked by a kind of mystical power. What you're looking are only some of the things present before the entrance of the Mysterious Realm.\" A bald old man, but with a long white beard and long white eyebrows suddenly appeared behind Chen Xiang and the others.Chen Xiang and the others were startled, and they quickly turned around, only to see a bald old man right in front of them slightly smiling, with a pair of narrowed old eyes right under the long white eyebrows looking very harmonious.Mysterious Realm, some small independent s.p.a.ce. This was equivalent to one small world, and was very mystical. Like how this Mysterious Realm was not very big, but if looked at from the outside it was invisible, and only if one went through its entrance could one clearly see. It was still a mystery how this kind of Mysterious Realm was formed.Chen Xiang and the others have heard the legends of the Mysterious Realms, but they actually had not expected for one to exist in the Extreme Martial Sect. Moreover it was also in the Elder Courtyard!\"Elder Wu!\" Chen Xiang and others shouted in unison, and gave a salute to this old man.Elder Wu name was Wu Kaiming \u6b66\u5f00\u660e, and he was responsible for the safety matters of the Extreme Martial Sect. He was one ruthless character, and it was confirmed that once to save his own apprentice, he rushed in alone to a Devil Path Sect, and rescued his disciple.\"No need to be overly courteous.\" Wu Kaiming happily smiling said, \"You're Chen Xiang? Elder Dan asked me a moment ago to make things difficult for you in the third a.s.sessment, but I refused. I do not want a disciple to hate their sect, but having said that, you truly are one of a kind, making that woman suppress a lot of anger. Fortunately, she is not an overly bad-tempered woman, otherwise, she would have beaten you to death. We old men can only say a few words on the surface to her.\u201dAfter hearing this, this made Zhu Rong, Yun Xiaodao and the others break into cold sweat.Chen Xiang said with a smile, \"So it seems I really do have very good luck, but now it seems to be she is no longer going to do anything against me? Regarding this, it can be counted as I was easily let off!\"\"Hard to say, this woman\u2019s temper is a little strange, so you better not let her continue to hate you, otherwise..............You will be tortured by her in such a way that you will wish for a death.\" Wu Kaiming said while laughing, and regarding Chen Xiang, such rare and wonderful flower, he was very much interested. As for Chen Xiang's potential, it was very obvious to many people that Elder Dan was intentionally making things difficult in his case, and he was still able to pa.s.s!\"No more nonsense, I'll not start talking about the content of the third a.s.sessment. Some regions in the Mysterious Realm you will have to carry on a mission to hunt and kill demon beasts, and you must do it within three days, while each person must hunt three Grade-10 demon beasts! There are a very large number of demon beasts inside, and their strength is also comparable with yours, so as long as you complete this, you can pa.s.s the third a.s.sessment.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 Elder CourtyardChen Xiang and the others ,regarding the Mysterious Realm, didn\u2019t know too much, and just knew that it was very mysterious. Moreover it had regions where a large number of heaven bred treasures existed, and even had a large number of demon beasts. For martial artists, it was a natural treasury, but there were also many unknown dangers.Elder Wu saw them having a doubtful expression and immediately said, \"The Elder Courtyard had already been moved into this Mysterious Realm, and this Mysterious Realm's ins and outs are well known to us. This is already within our control so you do not have to worry about encountering the strong demon beasts, the only strongest demon beasts are Grade-10 demon beasts.\"Zhu Rong asked, \"Haven\u2019t all the heaven bred treasures already been plundered by you? If these three guys picked up some of the remaining treasures, will they have to hand those over to you? At my a.s.sessment how is it that I didn't have this kind of a.s.sessment?\"Elder Wu scoffingly said, \"Little fatty, you and your family are really like that old fatty! If they come and pick up some good things, they do not need to hand it over to us, but it must be reported to us for us to know. If you want to dispose of it, then selling it to the Extreme Martial Sect takes precedence.\"In the third a.s.sessment they actually had to hunt and kill three Grade-10 demon beasts. This test was indeed a test of one's combined strength, and Chen Xiang was looking very forward to it.\"In front there are three roads, respectively leading to three or more demon beasts locations. This is the storage belt which can store a large number of things, and you also need to bring back the demon beasts corpses. Remember you can not pocket them or else we'll know about it! We are the ones who placed the demon beasts inside but after you kill them, you can get half of demon beast which can be considered a reward for you!\" Elder Wu took out three black belts and handed it to them.Chen Xiang and the others took the belt, and afterwards mutually encouraged each other. They then embarked on the roads that led them deep into the Mysterious Realm.\"Elder Wu, where is the Elder Courtyard?\" After Zhu Rong saw Chen Xiang and others leaving, he looked around but did not see any kind of building.\"Secret, in short, it is inside but I can tell you that Elder Dan also moved a few of her small courtyards of the Extreme Dan Courtyard. So long as you enter those few small courtyards, you will be able to stay inside for a long time.\" Elder Wu mysteriously smiled..The Elder Courtyard of the Extreme Martial Sect had always been a mystery, and no one knew how many old men were in it. They also didn\u2019t know their exact strength, as people only knew a few of the Elders.\"Sometimes it is not needed for one to be very powerful to enter the Elder Courtyard, and as long as you reach a certain stage, you'll know. Every once in awhile there will be an Elder a.s.sessment, and once you are able to pa.s.s that, you'll be able to become an Elder.\" Elder Wu patted Zhu Rong's shoulder, then took him away.Chen Xiang was walking on the road, watching the numerous stars in the beautiful sky, breathing the scent in the air, and he felt that it was very rich in Spirit Qi here, and sighed in his heart.\"I did not expect the Extreme Martial Sect to also have such a big mystery and even have a Mysterious Realm. I think they have almost exploited all the resources of the Mysterious Realm and now preparing to announce their Extreme Martial Sect's confidential secret. This will create momentum for the Extreme Martial Sect.\" said Su Meiyao.\"Sister Meiyao, have you seen any other Mysterious Realms?\" Chen Xiang asked.\"Of course I have, but nothing like this where it is so beautiful. There are some very dangerous places, but inside they also have a lot of heaven bred treasures. This is a fact.\" Su Meiyao replied.The Extreme Martial Sect could stand at the peak in the Chenwu Mainland, and they reached such a stage depending on this Mysterious Realm!............In an old mansion of a courtyard, three transparent crystal b.a.l.l.s were hanging as high as the height of a human, and from the three crystal b.a.l.l.s one could clearly see Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao, Zhang De, their silhouettes. It was like a picture that was overlooking from the sky.Next to the three crystal b.a.l.l.s, there were twenty or so people, and among these people there was also Wu Kaiming, Elder Dan, and some other old men or women. There were also several middle-aged and young people, but most of them had a mask on their face.Because a number of years had pa.s.sed since any disciple had pa.s.sed the second a.s.sessment, and now there was Chen Xiang, this remarkable young man who pa.s.sed through, these Elder Courtyard's Elder men and women all wanted to take a look at Chen Xiang and how he would pa.s.s through the second a.s.sessment.\"This Chen Xiang brat is so talented, and certainly did not reach this stage by the guidance of an ordinary person. He must have a powerful guy behind him, but why did he come to the Extreme Martial Sect? We have never seen the martial technique he uses, and although they are not very high-ranked, but comparing it with the martial technique of same level they are very strong!\" One average looking young man said.\"Hei Hei, I'm truly not clear why Elder Dan would want to play with such a large gambling stake with him. What if in the one in a million chance he wins?\" said Wu Kaiming while laughing.Other people also expressed their surprise.Elder Dan coldly snorted and said, \"Old man Wu, if you beat me now I'll immediately marry you. As long as anyone here can beat me, I'll marry him!\"n.o.body said anything again. Wanting to win against Elder Dan was not an easy thing, and even the Extreme Martial Dean who went into closed-door training would also not dare to try.\"Now we have to find out why this brat came to the Extreme Martial Sect!\" That young man said.\"He should not have any kind of motive, as according to what we have gathered, he came to the Extreme Martial Sect just to elevate himself. Although he can use formidable martial skills, but it is not by much, and I think he may have come here regarding this.\" Wu Kaiming replied.\"It is also likely that he came here just to enhance his alchemy techniques, but he should not even think about entering the Extreme Dan Courtyard,\" Elder Dan sneered.\"Do not be so sure. Didn\u2019t you say before that you'll not let him pa.s.s through the second a.s.sessment? But he still successfully pa.s.sed, and also showed off in front of you.\" Elder Wu said while laughing.\"Humph! This brat. Sooner or later, there will be a day when I'll ask him to clear all the debt.\" Elder Dan snorted and said.\"I hope he does not have any bad motive, otherwise, we'll not be lenient!\" That young man said.Elder Wu nodded his head, and said, \"Anybody interested in receiving him as an apprentice? This is a very good seedling. Moreover we can also have a clear understanding of him.\"Everybody here were capable people and certainly Elder Courtyard Members, so all of them were very powerful and had strong authority. At this time they were having a discussion, they had already seen Chen Xiang's potential, especially his indomitable personality had also obtained most of their appreciation.\"Whoever dares to receive him as an apprentice, you are against me!\" Elder Dan suddenly shouted, making everyone once again quite down, \"Even if Boss Dean wanted him as an apprentice, I'll make him not feel any better! Not to mention it is still not an uncertainty whether or not he will enter the True Martial Realm. For many years have we not seen many geniuses stuck in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm for a lifetime?\"Everybody could see that Elder Dan hated Chen Xiang very much. At this time they were also the same as those disciples, and did not understand why would Elder Dan hates Chen Xiang so much.\"Girl, you're stingy. Is not because that young arrogant little fellow contradicted you or anything? Are you still preoccupied with it?\" One old man laughed and shook his head, and after everyone heard, their body could not help but tremble.Because they knew that this mysterious Elder Dan was very vengeful, and the person whom she hated, will not have a good ending. A long time ago, few fearsome Devil Lords in the Devil Path used words to blasphemy her, and she made their fate totally worse than death.Chen Xiang at this time was smiling, and leisurely walking on the road, watching the beautiful Mysterious Realm. He totally didn't know that he was being watched and discussed by a group of strange old men, and moreover he didn't know that Elder Dan was thinking of another way to make things difficult for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 Treasure HuntThe road Chen Xiang was originally walking on, was paved with bricks but now it suddenly turned into a dirt road. Chen Xiang also psyched himself as he felt he had entered the demon beast infested region.He left the the prairie region, arriving at a region with many weeds, and he suddenly noticed something.\"There seems to be humans. Demon beast\u2019s breath should definitely not be like this.\" Chen Xiang was uncertain in his heart as he felt a few humans hiding inside the thick patch of gra.s.s.Chen Xiang's body shook a little, releasing a wave of True Qi, and the weeds all around him were shattered, only to see four young men, who were wearing the Extreme Martial Sect Disciple's dress appear, while each of them had a black stick in their hand.\"What do you want to do?\" Chen Xiang loudly asked, and he sensed a kind of polished Fire Qi emanating from these four disciple\u2019s bodies. These four individuals were fire attributed, and they were all exuding a slightly medicinal-herb smell. Only someone dealing with herbs all year around would have this kind of smell.The four men were in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, while at the same time they moved and surrounded Chen Xiang.\"You are Chen Xiang?\" One man with delicate and pretty kind of appearance asked.\"Yes!\" Chen Xiang voice fell, meanwhile the four men at the same time waved their stick in their hands towards Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang immediately released a Qi Aura s.h.i.+eld, blocking off the four incoming iron sticks, sneered and said, \"You are from the Extreme Dan Courtyard, right?\"Chen Xiang\u2019s words made the four men\u2019s whole body tremble, but they did not say anything and continued to attack Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang concluded that these four individuals were Inner Sect Disciples, but also from the Extreme Dan Courtyard, as their strength was also not bad.Four black iron sticks turned red, burning with severe flames, and released a scorching hot Qi Aura. Someone was stabbing, another was striking, and another was raising their stick to attack Chen Xiang.[ED Note: Not sure what the fourth guy is doing but ask the author that questions:P]The four men\u2019s strength and Chen Xiang's was just about the same, and sensing the fearful power that they released, Chen Xiang only now understood the difference between an Inner Sect and Outer Sect Disciple.It was a first for Chen Xiang to be surrounded by several equally matched opponents, but he did not panic. His brow wrinkled, and an endless Slaughter Qi permeated from his body shrouding the four people\u2019s bodies, making them suddenly startled.The moment they became surprised, Chen Xiang fiercely did a 360 degree kick, and Vermillion Bird True Qi and Azure Dragon True Qi gathered on his legs, blowing out a fearful fire and lightning power, kicking off the iron stick in their hands which was then followed by a fierce jump into the air.\"Were you sent by Dan? Tell her, if she sends someone again, then don't blame me for being impolite! Whoever hinders me in the a.s.sessment, I'll destroy anyone!\" Chen Xiang\u2019s voice was filled with Slaughter Qi, and from his back burst out a firelight. A pair of flame wings in the blink of an eye were congealed on his back.Chen Xiang released the [Vermillion Bird Fire Wing], and flew out of those disciple\u2019s encirclement. If he had not casted the [Slaughtering Heart], then he definitely would still be surrounded by the four men and it would be very difficult for him to get out. At the least he would have to spend his time and strength.Inside the Courtyard, Wu Kaiming sighed and said, \" Dan, you should just give up. This brat's Slaughter Qi is very heavy, and if he gets mad, maybe he would really start killing.\"Flames were glittering in Dan's pupils, and seeing the Chen Xiang travelling in the air in the crystal ball, she could not help but clench both of her fists, and coldly snorted.Seeing Chen Xiang's gorgeous and dazzling [Vermillion Bird Fire Wing], all the s were filled with envy, only to hear one old man talking with a sigh, \"This True Qi wing compared with mine is much better. You look at those feathers. They are simply life like, as if these flame wings are grown from that brat\u2019s flesh and blood. In the end what kind of martial skill is this?\"\"Yes, his speed is also so fast, and if he also had more strength, then his flying speed with this True Qi wing would be much faster.\" Another old man closely watching Chen Xiang's [Vermillion Bird Fire Wing] spoke.Chen Xiang, under the four men\u2019s staring eyes and opened mouthes, fluttered the [Vermillion Bird Fire Wings] and flew away. Of course, he himself didn't know that he was always being watched.\"Chen Xiang, it is best that you remain low-key, this is the Extreme Martial Sect's old codgers site, and your each and every move is known by them.\" Bai Youyou reminded him.After Chen Xiang heard that he slightly raised his little mouth, dived to the ground coming next to a tree, unlocked his belt, and while humming started peeing..............\"Someday, I'll have to take a good look at this brat!\" Dan clenched her teeth and said. She then flung her head and left.Chen Xiang pulled up his pants, but heard a burst of a very faint sound. It was like someone or something had stepped on a fallen leaf and emitted a very subtle sound.\"Good fellas. In such a far place someone shady has come over!\" Chen Xiang was listening with rapt attention, and he did not expect he would encounter a demon beast so soon!\"Chen Xiang, in this Mysterious Realm there might be some treasures. Didn't that old baldy say that what you found is yours? Human beings can not be compared with these demon beasts. They are naturally born with a mystical spiritual sense, which is capable of finding some rare and exotic treasures. If you can track these demon beasts, perhaps you'll find some good things.\" said Su Meiyao.Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes had an excited look and he said, \"I understand, here there are are demon beasts because these old men intentionally put them to search for rare and exotic treasures.\"Grade-10 demon beasts were equivalent to humankind\u2019s 10th level Mortal Martial Realm, the Completion stage, but in line with their demon beast const.i.tution and innate ability, Grade-10 demon beasts were much more powerful than ordinary 10th level Mortal Martial Realm martial artists.\"Here demon beasts are common demon beasts, so if you use your [Dragon Slaying Divine Martial Skill] or [Divine Exercise Of Four Symbols], then you can easily deal with them. These martial skills imitate the divine beast\u2019s breath so if an ordinary demon beasts senses it, they will be scared! But it is useless in dealing with True Martial Realm demon beasts.\" said Bai Youyou.Chen Xiang also did not expect the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] to have this kind of benefit and he started das.h.i.+ng towards that weak sound he had just previously heard.Chen Xiang was running swiftly, and while quickly moving he also sensed that hidden demon beast so he quickly dashed towards the demon beast,Not too long after, Chen Xiang and that demon beast met, and both of them, with breakneck speed, collided with each other at the same time.The moment Chen Xiang collided, he punched out a fist, striking that demon beast's body.This beast was covered in a black armor, and it was a panther with blue-eyed. It could not be counted as too big, but this was a very sensitive demon beast.\"Worthy of Grade-10 demon beast. My fists struck it but it did not inflict even a little bit of damage!\" Chen Xiang saw that blue-eyed panther swiftly and violently hurling towards him, and he could not help but exclaim.Chen Xiang's body shook, a golden light surged out, and in his heart he was silently reciting the Heart Law. The White Tiger True Qi within his body transformed into Dragon Aura as he was casting the [Dragon Slayer Divine Martial Skill]!Although this was an incomplete [Dragon Slayer Divine Martial Skill] but it could allow Chen Xiang's body to release the weak pressure of a dragon, and in addition to this it was filled Slaughter Qi made out of the White Tiger True Qi, which made it even more frightening.As Bai Youyou previously said, common demon beasts were very afraid of this kind of breath so when this kind of breath swooped over, the body of the panther fiercely trembled, and its speed also decreased by a lot.Chen Xiang blasted a fist towards that shuddering blue-eyed panther, struck its head, and made it howl, but after falling to the ground it once again stood firmly.\"Good fellas, it did not fall!\" Chen Xiang teasingly looked at that shuddering blue-eyed panther.The Blue-eyed panther emitted a growl, and unexpectedly turned around and dashed away.\"This guy unexpectedly is scared of me!\" Chen Xiang laughed and quickly followed it and was even faster than that blue-eyed panther, while his body was emanating Dragon Qi Aura made of Slaughter Qi.The people inside the Courtyard were very shocked after watching this. The demon beast was actually scared off by a human, like how a mouse saw a cat and flees, and in the hearts of a few old men, suddenly a bad feeling emerged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 Azure Profound FruitChen Xiang could overtake the blue-eyed panther anytime he wanted, but he was intentionally pursuing it neither too fast nor too slow. His goal was very obvious, he wanted to follow this blue-eyed panther and take a look at its eventual destination.The old men inside the Elder Courtyard quickly saw through Chen Xiang\u2019s intentions, this made their hearts a bit uncomfortable.Chen Xiang followed the blue-eyed panther until they arrived next to a large tree. That blue-eyed panther climbed up onto that large tree as Chen Xiang soon followed.Above that tree was a hollow entrance. As Chen Xiang went inside the opening, the blue-eyed panther started howling and trembling, there was no escape route, only a dead end.Inside that hollowed out area, there was a haystack. Upon which, were a few stones that resembled eggs and emitted a strong azure aura. Chen Xiang sucked in a mouth full of cold air and exclaimed, \u201cAzure Profound Fruit, and five of them! This is the key material required for refining a Foundation Building Dan!\u201dThe Azure Profound Fruit was a type of tuberous fruit. Very rarely, did the roots under the ancient trees sometimes start to gather a large amount of Spirit Qi. If at the right place and time, along with some special conditions being met, the roots may turn into a fruit. However, having a tree meeting these prerequisites was extremely rare!After being briefly shocked, Chen Xiang quickly took these five fruits and placed them into his storage pouch. Then he said with a smile to that blue-eyed panther, \u201cThanks! I will spare you life for this!\u201dJumping down from the tree, Chen Xiang was very excited. He quickly left that part of the forest. He had never expected that he would obtain five Azure Profound Fruits. But this was even more shocking for the Elders inside the Elder Courtyard. Although they were all very strong experts, seeing this little devil who had not even entered the True Martial Realm obtain such good materials, they could not help but envy him.Morning arrived as warm sunlight permeated the atmosphere throughout this Mysterious Realm. Currently, Chen Xiang was holding a steel blade and standing high above a mound, watching the lush green prairie for demon beasts.\u201cThis annoying brat is just standing there in broad daylight. He\u2019s seeking his own death! That\u2019s the grazing area for the Grade-10 Iron Armor Bulls!\u201d Elder Dan sneered.\u201cThis brat has some bizarre and unique martial skills. He\u2019s actually able to make demon beasts fear him! Is this a type of Dragon Martial Art?\u201d Wu Kaiming had a doubtful look on his face.At this time, Chen Xiang, who was still standing on top of the mound, saw around twenty bulls coming out from inside the forest. Marching with a heavy pace, each one was howling, their bodies covered in a topaz colored armor that looked very sharp and tough. The one leading the herd had two scythe like horns protruding from its head. From its posture, it seemed ready to charge and crush anything in it\u2019s path.All of a sudden around twenty or so beasts appeared, not only that, but they were Grade-10 demon beasts! If any ordinary martial artists saw this, they would surely choose to avoid the herd. But Chen Xiang wasn\u2019t an ordinary martial artist as he drew out his blade and rushed towards the pack.\u201cThis crazy brat! Isn\u2019t he just seeking death?\u201d Wu Kaiming could not help but exclaim. Although he had some grasp about Chen Xiang\u2019s true strength, he did not think that Chen Xiang would be able to deal with all the Iron Armor Bulls.Seeing someone rus.h.i.+ng toward them, the herd of Iron Armor Bulls suddenly started bellowing. The relatively larger bull leader rushed out from the herd and emitted an angry growl. Its thick and strong hooves trampled on the prairie with each step splas.h.i.+ng various gra.s.s and dirt up into the air. Letting out thunderous sounds, it dashed towards Chen Xiang, and along the way even aroused a burst of fierce wind.The two giant horns on the Iron Armor Bull were pointing straight at Chen Xiang. It was like two sharp and giant thorns were speeding towards him.Before the bull was about to reach him, Chen Xiang stepped aside and at the same time, brandished his blade in a chopping motion. Chen Xiang had poured his vigorous True Qi into the broadsword, which in turn transformed into a Qi Aura that gushed out of the blade, making it even more sharper.\"Clang\"The steel broadsword slashed onto that Iron Armor Bull\u2019s neck as sparks and intense Qi waves burst out from the impact. Chen Xiang\u2019s steel blade was shattered into pieces. He did not actually manage to cut the bull\u2019s neck, and only destroyed his own weapon.At this very moment, Chen Xiang realized that common Ordinary Grade Weapons would not be able to easily deal with Grade-10 demon beasts. Even though he added his vigorous Qi Aura, his blow only shook the Iron Armor Bull and nothing more.Chen Xiang\u2019s blow actually caused zero injuries to the bull, and it was clear how st.u.r.dy the Bull\u2019s Iron Armor was!\u201cThis brat is still too immature. You know, sooner or later, he\u2019ll suffer a setback.\u201d Elder Dan sneered. She and Wu Kaiming were looking at the large bull herd that was galloping towards Chen Xiang from far away.Chen Xiang threw away his broken weapon as his complexion turned serious. He clenched his hand into fists and revolved the invisible True Qi within his body. In response, the True Qi from the five divine beast forms as they surged out and gather at one place, transforming into the colorless and invisible Universal True Qi!This was Chen Xiang\u2019s true strength, simultaneously using the True Qi of the five elements!\"[Dragon Aura Fist!]\"The Universal True Qi that was around Chen Xiang\u2019s fists was suddenly converted into Dragon Aura. The aura surroundings his fists instantly changed and looked as if they had been moulded out from pure gold. With terrifying power and momentum, punches flew out one after another in a seemingly endless storm of piercing Qi waves.Seeing this draconic might suddenly appear, the bull was terrified as it\u2019s whole body started s.h.i.+vering. Chen Xiang relentlessly and ruthlessly pounded the bull with a barrage of blows. In the blink of an eye, dozens of punches were sent out, and in that moment the golden fist\u2019s images were flas.h.i.+ng, all of which struck directly onto the bull\u2019s head. Whenever a blow landed on the Iron Armor Bull, gus.h.i.+ng blood soon followed. Chen Xiang\u2019s fists sheathed in the destructive Qi Aura broke through the bull\u2019s head and entered into the bull\u2019s body as it destroyed the inside of the bull.In just a few seconds, more than 200 clean [Dragon Aura Fists] landed onto that bull\u2019s head. Afterwards, the Iron Armor Bull fell down with a loud thump.After Chen Xiang entered the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, his True Qi became even more vigorous as the result of being compressed. Even if he were to continuously use the Universal True Qi to launch his violent attacks, he did not need to worry anymore about his True Qi consumption.The remaining twenty or so Iron Armor Bulls that were rus.h.i.+ng at him from afar were also subjected to that faint draconic pressure. Their instincts screamed in fear and they turned around to quickly try and escape.Chen Xiang fiercely leapt into the sky, like an arrow fired from the ground into the air, and flew over the entire herd of bulls. He then emitted a crazy howl before blasting a palm towards the ground.This blow of his suddenly burst out into an azure and red aura. The source of these two clas.h.i.+ng auras was the vigorous Azure Dragon and Vermillion Bird True Qi, which he had completely released and fused together into a fearsome Qi Aura. He then used his divine sense to gather and compress it to form the enormous palm.After the compressed True Qi from Chen Xiang was completely released, it looked like something solid, unlike the previous gas like form!The giant palm fiercely pressed downwards, completely covering those twenty or so bulls!A thunderous booms resounded as the land burst into a fierce tremor. A huge palm imprint emerged onto the prairie's surface. Chen Xiang withdrew the rest of the remaining True Qi and poured it into the two dark beast forms inside his dantian. The beast forms were similar to transparent crystals. As long as they were filled with True Qi, they would start emitting Aura once more.Chen Xiang flew down from the air and walked towards the sunken palm imprint. In just a blink of an eye, those twenty or so bulls had been crushed to death and turned into gigantic meat patties. Inside this crater that resembled a palm imprint, was an area was filled with blood and meat, creating a very nauseating scene.Wu Kaiming blinked his old eyes a few times, just to make sure he wasn\u2019t going senile before the he squeezed out two words from the gap between his teeth. \u201cAbnormal freak!\u201dJust like him and everyone else watching, they had been secretly shocked by Chen Xiang\u2019s strength. In their opinion, only an elite few disciples among the Inner Sect Martial Courtyard were capable of such a feat. It must be known that those Inner Sect Disciples have been here for a long time and learnt many martial skills and compressed their True Qi to a very rich form!Collecting the ravaged corpses of the bulls, Chen Xiang backtracked. He wanted to quickly enter the Inner Sect!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 D\u00e9tenteChen Xiang had just instantly killed twenty three Grade-10 demon beasts, furthermore it was done in a very leisurely manner. He soon returned to the original starting point, where he waited for Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De.After waiting for almost a day, Chen Xiang saw Zhang De with an expression full of happiness walking in the distance. From just one glance, he could already tell that Zhang De had completed the task.\u201cOld Man Zhang, congratulations!\u201d Chen Xiang quickly laughed.\u201cHei Hei. Same to you Chen Xiang, but you have pa.s.sed the test in one go! Furthermore you\u2019re so young. You\u2019re really someone with boundless prospects!\u201dYun Xiaodao still hadn\u2019t returned. This made Chen Xiang and Zhang De somewhat concerned, but they did not have to wait for long. Suddenly, they heard a hawk\u2019s cry followed by a kind of very proud laughter.\u201cHa Ha, I earned a lot!\u201d Yun Xiaodao\u2019s laughter resounded. Chen Xiang and Zhang De looked up, only to see a giant black hawk flying high in the sky. Seated on which, was a grinning youth.Yun Xiaodao had actually tamed a Blackhawk! Taming a demon beast is a very difficult thing to do, but Yun Xiaodao had done it, and had indeed earned a lot.All three returned safe and sound, moreover with a very rewarding experience. At this time, Wu Kaiming and Elder Dan also arrived before them.\u201cTreasures that you have obtained yourself or demon beast corpses you have brought, as I said before, are yours. However, you do need to report them.\u201dChen Xiang took out the ravaged corpses of the twenty three demon beasts which had been morphed into the giant meat patties, along with five Azure Profound Fruit. This scared Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De, who both emitted a high pitched shriek of shock. They were very clear about the Iron Armor Bull. They knew it was a gregarious type of demon beast, moreover with very strong defensive capabilities, and decent power. Yet now they were nothing more than giant meat patties. With just a glance, they knew that Chen Xiang started with a heavy hand and had, in a single breath, gotten rid of these demon beasts.\u201cTwenty three\u2026 Elder Brother Chen you truly are abnormal!\u201d Yun Xiaodao said. He then took out the corpses of two tiger type demon beasts and one of a large bear. He then embraced the giant black hawk behind him and said, \u201cLao Hei has been tamed by me, therefore he belongs to me!\u201d\u201cThat is natural!\u201d Wu Kaiming said with a smile.Zhang De had killed four giant wolves and also found a Three Thousand Year Blood Ginseng. His harvest was also not bad.\u201cAre you going to sell those Azure Profound Fruits?\u201d Elder Dan asked while staring at the five fruit placed by Chen Xiang onto the ground, which was circulating an azure light.\u201cNot selling!\u201d said Chen Xiang with a low snort.Azure Profound Fruit!Zhang De and Yun Xiaodao were once again shocked. Chen Xiang had actually gotten such a good thing, this made both of them secretly jealous of Chen Xiang\u2019s luck.The rank of the Foundation Building Dan could not be counted as a high rank, but the herbs required for making it were very rare. The costs and rarity for these herbs could even be compared with those needed for some high level dans! The Azure Profound Fruit was one of the main ingredients, and even though its rank was not that high, the Foundation Building Dan was a wonder drug in helping someone enter the True Martial Realm so they were sold at very expensive prices.\u201cSell it to me, afterwards I\u2019ll help you in refining the Foundation Building Dan for free! I do not casually refine pills for others!\u201dElder Dan was also very interested in the Azure Profound Fruit. Although she had previously obtained ten of them, they had all been quickly used up. It was really a long time ago, and she had not since refined a Foundation Building Dan.\u201cIf you had previously not made things difficult for me, giving you one of them would not matter to me, but now I\u2019ll not sell it to you for any price!\u201d Chen Xiang flung aside his head. He does not want to see her again.Yun Xiaodao hastily pulled Chen Xiang in the next instant, fearing that he would provoke Elder Dan\u2019s anger. If that were to happen, it would become very troublesome.\"500,000 crystal stones for one, will you sell?\" Elder Dan sneered. She does not believe that Chen Xiang would not be tempted.\"I will not sell!\" Chen Xiang firmly replied.\"1,000,000 crystal stones, selling or not?\" Elder Dan coldly asked.\"Sold!\" Chen Xiang grinned. 1,000,000 crystal stones was absolutely not a small amount, and if he was not going to sell, well then he was an idiot. Furthermore, this would also be bad for his relations.h.i.+p with Elder Dan.\"Humph, I'm not going to buy!\" Elder Dan said and like a angry little girl, stamped her foot on the ground and turned to leave.Chen Xiang curled his lips and said, \u201cTch, this woman is breaking her promise. Earlier she had said she would marry me if I win. I laboriously defeated her and now she\u2019s going back on her words. What should I do\u2026?\u201dWhen Elder Dan heard his statement, she turned back and coldly said, \u201c1,000,000 crystal stones. I\u2019ll buy!\u201dChen Xiang really wanted to rip off Elder Dan\u2019s mask and take a look at the appearance of the Extreme Martial Sect's only female.\u201cHow is the relations.h.i.+p between you and the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire\u2019s Empress, is it okay?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. He had suddenly gotten an idea...\u201cWe\u2019re both female and our relations.h.i.+p is also not bad! Why do you ask?\u201d Elder Dan replied.\u201cI\u2019ll give you two Azure Profound Fruits. Can you help me refine one set of the Foundation Building Dan herbs and then send one dan to Xue Xianxian and the other to Leng Youlan in Icewind Valley?\u201d Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes were rotating.At most, successfully refining a complete set of herbs for the Foundation Building Dan would result in two dans if done without any wastage. Normally alchemists were only able to refine one dan, but Chen Xiang firmly believed that Elder Dan was capable of producing two dans.\u201cI will not take your crystal stones. It can be regarded as a gift to Elder Dan.\u201d Chen Xiang said. He really did not want to have such stiff relations with Elder Dan, because later on he not only wanted to enter the Extreme Dan Courtyard, but also planned to stay in the Extreme Martial Sect for a very long time. Maybe in the future, when he goes out to explore the Chenwu Mainland for experience, he might stir up some trouble. At that time, he may need to get shelter in the Extreme Martial Sect.Wu Kaiming, Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De could all see Chen Xiang\u2019s reason for acting like this, and they also very much supported it.Elder Dan was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cDo you want to know why I hate you?\u201dChen Xiang shook his head, sighed then said, \"I would very much like to know.\"\"If you defeat me I'll tell you!\" Elder Dan picked up two Azure Profound Fruit. With far less hatred in her voice, she asked, \"Who is Leng Youlan to you? You already have Xue Xianxian as your fiancee, yet you still think of others. Men really are like this.\"Chen Xiang quickly explained, \u201cYoulan is my sworn sister and I had sent her to join the Extreme Martial Sect. However, I did not know the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s rules beforehand, which is why she later went to Icewind Valley, but that is too far away. I can not go there anytime soon, and as her sworn brother I must take care of her. That\u2019s why I can only request this favour from Elder Dan.\u201d\u201cHumph, sworn sister? That\u2019s a nice way to put it. Who knows what other intentions you have in your mind?\u201d Elder Dan finished speaking, turned around and left. Chen Xiang and the others were slightly surprised, Elder Dan\u2019s voice had a tinge of jealousy in it...\u201cElder Brother Chen\u2026 I\u2019ve been calling you this from the very start! Will you also take me as a sworn brother or not?\u201d Yun Xiaodao said with a depraved smile while looking at the three Azure Profound Fruit in Chen Xiang\u2019s hand.Chen Xiang blankly looked at Yun Xiaodao before replying, \u201cYou\u2019re a very rich guy! You do not need to care about this little thing!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Chen really had ill intentions when receiving your sworn sister.\u201d Yun Xiaodao muttered. He also knew a bit about Leng Youlan. She and Xue Xianxian were similar, both were known as one of the most talented in the younger generation.Wu Kaiming coughed dryly twice before saying, \u201cYou are starting to resolve the differences between you and Elder Dan. This is very good. Now, I congratulate the three of you in becoming one of the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s Inner Disciples. You can take away half the demon beast corpses that you have acquired. Later on, Little Fatty can walk you through the Inner Martial Courtyard so you all can get familiarized with it.After the three of them took away the demon beasts corpses, they left the Mysterious Realm extremely excited. Zhu Rong had been waiting outside for them for quite some time.Because the relations.h.i.+p between Zhu Rong and Yun Xiaodao was quite good, he was arranged to guide Chen Xiang and the others through the Inner Sect.[TLN: D\u00e9tente is a French word meaning release from tension, here it is referring to the easing of relations between Elder Dan and Chen Xiang. This term is often used in reference to the general easing of the geo-political tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States which began in 1969. ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 Inner CourtyardThe most excited person was Yun Xiaodao. As he walked out of the Mysterious Realm, he clamored to go to the squinting guy to ask for his 1000 True Qi Dans. Zhu Rong, seeing Yun Xiaodao easily win 1000 True Qi Dans, was very jealous in his heart.On the basis that one True Qi Dan was sold for 500 crystal stones, then 1000 True Qi Dans would be equal to 500,000 crystal stones. This was a huge amount!\u201cElder Brother Chen, 90% of the 1000 True Qi Dans are yours, and 10% is mine. After all, I only undertook the gambling stake and nothing more. I spoke thoughtlessly in that matter, I did not expect to gain so this much!\u201d Yun Xiaodao said with a grin. Although this number was very large, in his eyes it was not accountable for anything. Over the many years, he had eaten far more than this amount.When Chen Xiang saw Yun Xiaodao not paying any attention to the 1000 True Qi Dans, he could not help but secretly suck down on his tongue. But once he remembered that the Yun Family was one of the four major families within the Extreme Martial Province, he also felt that it was not a big deal for Yun Xiaodao. Just one major family held a ton of crystal stone mineral resources, herbs, demon beasts, etc. Although they were not comparable to major sects, but they were regarded as the richest right afterward the major sects.\u201cFatty, your Zhu Family is similar to my Yun Family! Your wealth should also be comparable to ours right? Because you are also very stingy and treacherous!\u201d Yun Xiaodao patted Zhu Rong\u2019s back and said with a laugh.Zhu Rong only snorted in response. From the posture of his body, one could tell that his family foundation was very thick.Zhang De shook his head and let out a sigh, \u201cIf one has a good background, it may very well allow them to struggle less for a few decades!\u201dChen Xiang and the others followed Zhu Rong and headed towards the 329th Martial Courtyard. This was the weakest Martial Courtyard among the all the Inner Martial Courtyards. It was also the location where all the new members had to go after entering the Inner Martial Courtyard.\u201cThere is not a single person?\u201d Yun Xiaodao doubtfully said. Afterwards, he shouted, \u201cAnyone!? Quickly come out to greet the newcomers!\u201dZhu Rong curled his lips and said \u201cDo not shout. For many years, no one has entered the Inner Sect. It has always been like this!\u201dChen Xiang asked, \u201cSo to say, the disciples of this Inner Martial Courtyard have all gone to higher ranking Martial Courtyards? But if so, then shouldn\u2019t some disciples be defeated and forced to come here?\u201dZhu Rong nodded his head, \u201cWhat you said is correct, however the Inner Martial Courtyard Disciples perform many missions which are very important and dangerous! Although there are more than 300 Inner Martial Courtyards, but each one has no more than ten Inner Sect Disciples! Where I am staying right now, there are only five disciples!\u201dBeing in the Inner Martial Courtyard comes with good benefits. Every month you can receive 300 True Qi Dan and 3000 crystal stones, and every year one True Elemental Dan. Also, whenever you go out to perform the missions, you will also get some healing and detoxification dans. Besides, there was always the reward for completing the mission. Zhu Rong got the precious White Jade Dan that way too.\u201cAll of the disciple of this Inner Courtyard are dead. In fact, up to the 300 Inner Martial Courtyard, every single one is empty.\u201d Zhu Rong\u2019s complexion turned series. Being an Inner Sect Disciple is not extremely dazzling as everyone thinks, they also have their own life threatening missions that they were required to complete.\u201cThen why did you not take us to the 300th Martial Courtyard?\u201d Yun Xiaodao blankly looked at Zhu Rong.\u201cLittle rascal Yun, I did this for your own good! If you move up a few numbers forward, then the tasks you will receive become more dangerous. You should wait for Chen Xiang to enter the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and then move forward step by step!\u201d Zhu Rong replied.Chen Xiang also agreed, \u201cWe have just entered the Inner Sect. We can now learn more higher leveled martial skills. Only after we get a good grasp on them and our strength stabilizes should we move forward!\u201d\u201cCome on. I\u2019m only in the 200th Martial Courtyard. It took me a very long time to rise up to that level. You better clean up the place, I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d Zhu Rong walked away very quickly. He was worried Chen Xiang and the others would ask him to help them clean up.This Martial Courtyard contained many small houses. The residence and Marital Courtyard were at the exact same place. Later on, Chen Xiang and the others did not need to take a different road to head to the Martial Courtyard from their residence.\u201cI\u2019ll not sleep here. You two can hurry up and clean it yourself!\u201d Yun Xiaodao giggled and then also left.Because no one has lived here for many years, there were a lot of dead leaves and dust gathered around. It took most of the day for Chen Xiang and Zhang De to finish cleaning the courtyard.Chen Xiang decided to stay in a building with a ton of training equipment. He did not find much use to these equipments, they were not too light but one needed to spend a large amount of time to exercise with them.\u201cThis kind of stuff is only used to kill time. For genuine practice, one needs to carry out a variety of extreme training or go out and gain experience.\u201d Zhang De said.At this time, Yun Xiaodao came back and excitedly shouted, \u201cElder brother Chen, I went to look for that squinting guy for the True Qi Dans. This guy actually very readily gave me the True Qi Dans, quickly take a look to check if it is not false.\u201dAs for the gambling stakes, Chen Xiang had not cared too much. He believed that if you were to ask for the 1000 True Qi Dans, it might become troublesome and might even escalate into a conflict.Yun Xiaodao took out ten jade boxes. Inside each box were 100 True Qi Dans. After Chen Xiang examined them, he determined that they were not fake. Although the quality was not as good as his refining, but they had reached the standard requirements.Yun Xiaodao only wanted one box. Chen Xiang originally wanted to give a box to Zhang De, but he was unwilling to accept. In the end, he bought the box for half of its price.Zhu Rong once gave Chen Xiang a box with White Jade Dan. Chen Xiang wanted to thank him and also gave one box to Zhu Rong. In spite of this, when he took the box his face was filled with jealousy. He had intended to buy three boxes for half the price, however in the end he was kicked out by Yun Xiaodao.Yun Xiaodao only wanted one box, and Chen Xiang originally wanted to give one box to Zhang De, but Zhang De was not willing to accept, at last he bought the box with half of its price.\"Utterly shameless fatty!\" Yun Xiaodao cursed.\u201cWe are now also considered Inner Sect Disciples. We can go and pick up some things. You can also go to the Inner Courtyard Regular Hall and look for good exercises of the Profound and Earth Level.\u201d Yun Xiaodao excited shouted before rus.h.i.+ng out of the Martial Courtyard.To receive these materials, one had to go to the Inner Martial Courtyard or the Extreme Dan Courtyard. A True Martial Realm Disciple was responsible for overseeing the process. Chen Xiang received 20 True Qi Dan and a True Elemental Dan, as well as 3000 crystal stones along with a handy Level 9 Ordinary Grade Weapon. It was a dragon head broadsword![TLN: Dragon Head on its hilt.]Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De also casually received their weapons, and they did not pay any attention to it afterwards.Walking on the road towards the Inner Courtyard Regular Hall, Yun Xiaodao saw Chen Xiang playing with the dragon head broadsword and asked, \u201cElder brother Chen, is that Level 9 Ordinary Grade Weapon any good? Me and old man Zhang use Spirit Grade Weapons. \u201cChen Xiang was startled, he suddenly understood why they could casually receive the same weapon. They actually had Spirit Grade Weapons!The cheapest Level 1 Spirit Weapon cost tens of thousands of crystal stones, so it was not that surprising for them to have one.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Spirit Grade Weapon before, how is it?\u201d Chen Xiang asked curiously.Yun Xiaodao took out a broadsword and very proudly said, \u201cThis is a Level 5 Spirit Grade Weapon, Sky Wolf Sword! It cost me a million crystal stones. The material used to forge it, Adamantyl Iron Wolf Bones, is extremely hard! Furthermore, above the blade are spirit vein carvings which can absorb the spirit and fuse it with Spirit True Qi, making the original True Qi stronger! Inside the blade, there are meridians similar to that of us humans. When one pours their True Qi into the blade, it can have an unhindered flow of True Qi. The hilt is also inlaid with the Adamantyl Iron Wolf\u2019s Beast Dan. If the beast dan were to be excited to release the demon beast\u2019s True Qi, then it would become even more formidable!\u201dChen Xiang could see that there was indeed beautiful and profound lines above the blade. After being illuminated by sunlight, the text was sparkling, and it was very beautiful!\u201cThat thing there could be considered in top grade among the Level 5 Spirit Weapons! Although it only cost 1,000,000 crystal stones, it\u2019s overall value is incomparable to that number. Relying on the connections of the Yun Family, you managed to get a well known refiner to forge this!\u201d Zhang De said with a look of envy mixed with jealousy and hate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 Divine Martial SkillLevel 5 Spirit Weapons were indeed very expensive! Chen Xiang had a refining weapon scroll. Whenever he had spare time, he would also take a brief look through it. He had a grasp on the difficulty of refining a Level 5 Spirit Grade Weapon, which was at least several times harder than refining a Level 1 Spirit Grade Weapon.\u201cThis old man only has a Level 2 Spirit Grade Sword, but it was worth 500,000 Crystal Stones.\u201d Zhang De also took out his own Spirit Weapon. The sword was very simple, but on the blade there were spirit veins, but just not as complex as the ones on Yun Xiaodao\u2019s Sky Wolf Sword.\u201cOld man Zhang, what if these were to go against each other?\u201d Yun Xiaodao grasped the hilt as the spirit veins on the blade suddenly burst into a bright light, becoming even more beautiful and charming!Zhang De regarded his Level 2 Spirit Weapon as his lifeblood and quickly put it away with a bitter smile, saying, \u201cIn your eyes a Spirit Grade Weapon three levels below yours might be similar to an Ordinary Grade Weapon, but for me it my lifeblood. I will not court my own destruction just to satisfy your curiosity.\u201dChen Xiang was also debating whether or not to get a Spirit Weapon. The last time he tried to use a normal Ordinary Grade Weapon to kill that bull, it was like trying to break a stone with an egg. If he had a good Spirit Weapon, then carrying out later missions would become a lot more convenient.Refining himself a weapon was an impossible task, Chen Xiang was already extremely busy with alchemy and he had no time to spare to learn how to forge a good weapon.\u201cRegrading Spirit Weapons, you do not need to worry. Your little wife is faring quite well in the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire. You can simply ask her teacher to refine a weapon, you might as well use the \u2018Spirit Veins Transforming Into Runes\u2019 aspect from the Refining Weapon Scroll. With the help of those spirit veins you can manufacture spirit runes! It is mentioned that spirit runes and spirit veins on Spirit Weapons act in a similar fas.h.i.+on.\" Su Meiyao said.Regarding runecrafting, Chen Xiang was also confused because Rune Masters were much rarer than Alchemists! Although there were some poor spirit runes in the market, reputed Rune Master works had never been sold or even heard of. Ordinary Rune Masters were only able to refine some common spirit runes and had not reached the level where their runes were unique and powerful.Chen Xiang and the others arrived at the Inner Courtyard Regular Hall. There was a total of three floors. The 1st floor contained Low Grade Profound Level Martial Skills, the 2nd Floor had the High Grade Profound Level Martial Skills, and the 3rd Floor had the Low Grade Earth Level Martial Skills.Inner Sect Disciples could only learn these three levels of martial skills.Chen Xiang was unlike Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De, who as soon as they arrived rushed straight to the top floor. He wanted to first take a look at the Low Grade Profound Level Martial skills, because he knew rank does not necessarily represent the strength of the Martial Skills. A combination of factors in each aspect was used to determine the strength and power of the skill.Just like how he could use the [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist] and display strength equal to a High Grade Martial Skill!\u201cf.u.c.king tricked us! There are only three Low Grade Earth Level Martial Skills. Other people have learnt them and don\u2019t want others to do the same!\u201d Yun Xiaodao came down from above with a look of disappointment.Zhang De had a similar expression. \u201cThere are only a few dozen High Grade Profound Level Martial Skills. There are only plenty of Low Grade Profound Level Martial Skills.\u201d\u201cHow is this the strongest major sect!? The Martial Skills are only so so, I\u2019ve come here in vain!\u201d Yun Xiaodao cursed in a low voice. In his imagination, the strongest sect should have thousands, or at least hundreds.The Inner Courtyard Regular Hall Manager, an old man, said with a smile, \u201cFor many years many Inner Sect Disciples have come here, and every time they were just as disappointed as you were. But in the end, they stopped complaining and have not commented on this matter, do you know why?\u201dChen Xiang also felt that it was a bit strange. If the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s Martial Skills were this bad, then they would not have been labeled as the strongest. There must be something else to it.\u201cWhy?\u201d Yun Xiaodao asked.That old man smiled and answered, \u201cEven in the Chenwu Mainland, the Extreme Martial Sect is one of the most powerful sects! How could these low level martial skills be the strongest the Extreme Martial Sect has to offer!? We have a lot of Heaven Level Martial Skills, but now they are more commonly known as Divine Martial Skills!Divine Martial Skill? Divine Exercise? The Extreme Martial Sect had a lot of them! This was a huge shock to Chen Xiang, Yun Xiaodao and Zhang De as they stood there speechless.\u201cWhile it not the same type of Divine Exercise as those in the legends, the Heaven Level Martial Skills have largely been improved. The advantage to these kinds of martial skills is that its strength changes depending on your own power. As your strength increases, so does the might of the martial skill! If you want to have one, you better find a teacher, otherwise you will only get one if you become a True Disciple.\u201d the old man said.Chen Xiang had no intent to find a teacher, but even if he wanted to there would be no one who would dare take him. This was because Elder Dan had made a public statement that whoever receives him as their apprentice, she would go against them with all her might.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that earlier! That\u2019s way too simple!\u201d Yun Xiaodao swiftly ran away. With his talent, finding a teacher is rather easy for him, as for Zhang De, he also swiftly walked away.\"You, are you the one called Chen Xiang? You don't need to go to look for teacher, Elder Dan has commanded that no one is allowed to receive you as an apprentice. These were Elder Dan's words and even the dean must listen. Hei hei, as soon as you came you annoyed Elder Dan. In the entire history of the sect you are the first person to do so. Look out for yourself!\" The old man patted Chen Xiang's shoulder.Chen Xiang cursed in his heart, \u201cIf I knew this earlier, I would not have given the Azure Profound Fruits to her. She even cut off my path!\u201d\u201cMy purpose in coming here was only to learn martial skills, how could it turn out like this?\u201d Chen Xiang was very upset in his heart. If he did not have a teacher, he would only be able to learn these Divine Martial Skills once he reached the True Martial Realm. Although the martial skills in the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] was formidable, it was not stronger by that much. Furthermore, if he wanted to learn them, there was certain level of strength required.Divine Martial Skills were mostly in the hands of the True Disciples in the True Martial Realm. These True Disciples were also allowed to receive and teach apprentices. If they were to pa.s.s their skills onto an outsider, they would be seriously punished.Five days past as Chen Xiang swept through the entire Inner Courtyard Regular Hall. Ultimately, he only borrowed two martial skills, and they were both Earth Level.\u201c[Shocking Heaven Palm] and [Profound Aura Finger]! There are very refined martial skills and the bodily requirements are also very high. Take [Shocking Heaven Palm] for example, you needed the strength of the meridians in your arm to be at a very high degree, and they should be able to withstand a sudden release of large amounts of True Qi, before you can release its fearsome might. Meanwhile the [Profound Aura Finger] needs you to temper your fingers through training such as immersing them in hot molten iron, baking your fingers in intense fire\u2026 You need to forge your fingers like a weapon should be\u2026\u201d\u201cOld man I know this already, hurry up and register it for me!\u201d Chen Xiang impatiently replied. He saw thick dust piled on these two books and knew that very few people took them because of how difficult it was to practice, however in his opinion it was not that difficult for him.After the old man registered the skills, Chen Xiang took the books and left. These past few days he had not seen Zhang De or Yun Xiaodao. Later on he learned from Zhu Rong that they were undergoing an a.s.sessment!Because they both wanted to find a teacher, they needed to satisfy the teacher\u2019s requirements and pa.s.s their a.s.sessment.\u201cRest a.s.sured, if you want to enter the True Martial Realm the only obstacle in your path is time. The two martial skills you chose are also not that bad!\u201d Su Meiyao said while comforting him. This was because it was she who made Chen Xiang come to the Extreme Martial Sect in the first place. If Chen Xiang was not satisfied it would be rather embarra.s.sing for her.Chen Xiang did not blame her because he knew that Su Meiyao\u2019s knowledge about the Extreme Martial Sect was from a very long time ago. It was natural for these things to change with time.Chen Xiang\u2019s body had already underwent refinement in the Immortal Devil Pool. His body was in the embryonic stage of an Immortal Devil Body which was why he already met the requirements. He could easily master the [Shocking Heaven Palm] and the [Profound Aura Finger]!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 Extreme Dan CourtyardChen Xiang now had two True Elemental Dans which were High-Grade Spirit Level Dans. Even in martial sects, dans of this level were extremely scarce which was why it was generally very difficult to obtain them. That was why many individuals collected their own herbs and hired an alchemist to refine it for them\u201cDo not eat these dans. Not too long ago you have just entered the 9th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm. You better make sure to first familiarize yourself with this state and wait for the time when you try to impact the 10th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm. At that moment, swallow it down in one breath!\u201d Su Meiyao said.Chen Xiang sighed. Just as he received the True Qi Dans, he only wanted to know as soon as possible how it tasted.[Shocking Heaven Palm] was a type of martial skill with a fearsome attacking power. In the blink of an eye, it could release a large amount of internal True Qi and generate a type of wide range invisible shockwave that could be used to attack from a long distance. At the same time, it could also be used for pin-point attacks and if one wanted to block it, they would have to waste a lot of their True Qi.\u201c[Shocking Heaven Palm]! Chen Xiang\u2019s five fingers spread out and a palm was blasted. In the blink of an eye, a dozen or so trees had been broken right in front of him and the soil in the ground also shook like a crest of sea waves. It truly had an overbearing might!Chen Xiang had been practicing inside a mountain forest owned by the Extreme Martial Sect. Had he been inside the Martial Courtyard, then perhaps the whole place would have been smashed.\u201cIn just three days I was able to execute it, that\u2019s quite quick!\u201d Chen Xiang seeing good result was very satisfied. \u201cAnother! Let\u2019s try out\u2026 the [Profound Aura Finger]!\u201dA light Azure Qi Aura surged out of the top of his index finger and wrapped around it. At this time, although the Qi Aura looked very calm, it also gave off a very oppressive atmosphere.Chen Xiang lightly poked this finger against a slab. A small hole immediately appeared, as if he had not poked a slab but a piece of tofu!Not to mention this slab, even if it was a Level 9 Ordinary Weapon, once it was clamped by two [Profound Aura Fingers], it would also immediately shatter!\"Hei Hei, if I use the colorless invisible True Qi. wouldn't it be more formidable? Maybe Spirit Weapons can also be broken!\" Chen Xiang said while laughing, he was very satisfied by this Low-Grade Earth Level Martial SkillAlthough [Azure Dragon Claw] was similar martial skill, but while casting it, it was very overbearing. On the other hand although the [Profound Aura Finger] was also a type of fast attacking martial skill, but while casting it, it was very mild, and it could be used for surprise attacks.When Chen Xiang returned to the Martial Courtyard, he saw Zhang De and Yun Xiaodao\u2019s faces br.i.m.m.i.n.g with happiness, and from this he knew they have definitely been taken by a good teacher.\"Elder brother Chen, you came at the right time, otherwise later on it would have been very difficult to see old man Zhang!\" Yun Xiaodao said.\"Oh? Why?\" Chen Xiang had a doubtful expression on his face.Zhang De smilingly said, \"My teacher is at the Extreme Martial Province border all year round, that's why I've decided to follow him, so that I can also experience this world, and can somewhat sharpen myself.\"\"This is also not bad, take care!\" Chen Xiang slightly smiled.Zhang De left, and Yun Xiaodao said with a smile, \"Elder brother Chen, do you want to know who my teacher is?\"\"Who? Don't tell me it's Elder Dan!\" Chen Xiang said while laughing.\"Of course not, it's an old matron of 3rd Martial Courtyard. She and our family have some relations, that's why she has taken me as an apprentice, but while I was doing the a.s.sessment, I was very badly tortured by her, and she also took away my Blackhawk!\" said Yun Xiaodao with a depressed look.A person from the 3rd Martial Courtyard! They could be considered as the powerful experts in the Extreme Martial Sect, and this made Chen Xiang quite surprised.\"Elder brother Chen, you do not have a teacher. Aren\u2019t you dispirited because of it?\" Yun Xiaodao asked in a low tone.Chen Xiang laughed and said, \"Xiaodao, you better cultivate seriously, otherwise you'll be completely left behind by me! I was able to grow up to this step alone so who wants a teacher?\"\"Xiaodao, you took a teacher, yet you also haven\u2019t asked us to go for drinks and meals? You are very cunning!\" Zhu Rong was coming with a smile on his face, since he knew Chen Xiang was an alchemist and also had a lot of resources, he would come here everyday. Chen Xiang also had 700 True Qi Dan so he could be absolutely considered as wealthy in the Inner Sect.\"Dead fatty, you only know how to take advantage of me! I've known you for so long, and you've never invited me!\" Yun Xiaodao cursed.\"Who says? The last time we went out, I invited you to eat a bowl of noodles!\" Zhu Rong immediately retorted, and he also had an aggrieved look on his face.\"Invited my a.s.s, that bowl counted as fart. Fis.h.i.+ng for half a day and I did not even find meat sc.r.a.ps.\" Yun Xiaodao walked towards him and kicked his foot.Zhu Rong snappily said, \"It can be considered as being invited. You were the first person who was ever invited by me, Zhu Rong!\"\"Right, Chen Xiang there is the Alchemy Compet.i.tion being held in the Extreme Dan Courtyard, do you want to go? The reward is two True Elemental Dan!\"\"What are the compet.i.tion rules like?\" Chen Xiang was excited in his heart, and quickly asked.\"What about it? It is just like before. Within a specified time, whoever can refine as many True Qi Dans with better quality will win!\" Zhu Rong rubbed his fatty palm together and said with smile.Chen Xiang slightly raised his mouth, his face was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with a confident smile, and immediately said, \"I'll definitely go!\"Finished talking, he quickly walked out of the Martial Courtyard, and started walking towards the Extreme Dan Courtyard. These days he also learned about the Extreme Dan Courtyard\u2019s location. A part of it was close to the Mysterious Realm, and a part of it was inside the Mysterious Realm.Chen Xiang came to the eight courtyards of the Extreme Dan Courtyard, and to their surprise, they ran into Yao Haisheng!\"How is it you again? What are you doing here?\" Yao Haisheng was to their surprise, in charge of the registration work here, because of how he treated Chen Xiang last time and how things also went too far so he was no longer responsible for the outside work.Enemies often crossed each other's path, and Chen Xiang did not expect to encounter Yao Haisheng, but he had heard Yao Haisheng was a Level-3 Alchemist. He could refine Middle-Grade Spirit Level Dans, so he still had quite a bit of prestige in the Extreme Martial Sect. No wonder his manners were like that on that day.Yao Haisheng became extremely furious when he saw Chen Xiang. Now Yao Haisheng was also paying Chen Xiang\u2019s fees to enter the Extreme Martial Sect. Not to mention, Yao Haisheng\u2019s apprentice was seriously injured by Chen Xiang.Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rong also hadn\u2019t expected that Chen Xiang would encounter his No. 2 enemy in the Extreme Martial Sect.\"Relying on you? Can you even refine a True Qi Dan? If you fail in refining, you have to pay the cost of the herbs with your own crystal stones, and if you continue to fail three time then you will be automatically withdrawn.\" Yao Haisheng spoke disdainfully.Just a moment ago, Chen Xiang learned from Zhu Rong that during this alchemy compet.i.tion the materials were all given by the Extreme Martial Sect and one had ten days for refining. This was mainly done so that the large amount of True Qi Dan herbs which had been collected for too long could be consumed. This way, not only could the sect quickly obtain a large number of True Qi Dans, but also it could allow the sect's alchemists to learn from each other, killing two birds with one stone.\"Of course I can!\" Chen Xiang's brow slightly wrinkled.At this time Yun Xiaodao shouted, \"Not only can elder brother Chen do so, but he will also get first place, thereby winning the two True Elemental Dans.\"\"I spit!\" Yao Haisheng burst out into laughter, \"If this brat, who smells of his mother's milk which has not yet dried, can win first place, then what will us old men who have been staying in the Extreme Dan Courtyard for many years feel then? If he can win first place, then this father will take him as a teacher!\"Chen Xiang thinking about this in his heart chuckled, as if he could see in front of him what this crazy smiling middle-aged man taking him as a teacher looked like.Many people in the Extreme Dan Courtyard casted a contemptuous gaze. No matter how talented Chen Xiang was, he was still seventeen years old, and at this age if he could refine a High-Grade Mortal Level Dan then it could be considered good. However, to refine a Low-Grade Spirit Level True Qi Dan he still fell short by a lot. After all, everyone who could refine the True Qi Dan knew that only after failing more than a 100 times could one be successfully able to refine a True Qi Dan, and they believed Chen Xiang absolutely could not afford to consume such a large number of herbs.Suddenly, one cold voice resounded, \"If Chen Xiang can win first, I'll make an exception and allow him to enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard!\"[TLN: Yao Haisheng appeared in Chapter 76]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 Alchemy Compet.i.tionThis was the sound of Elder Dan\u2019s voice, and Chen Xiang would never forget this even in his death. Her words made everybody in the 8th Dan Courtyard shudder. The Extreme Dan Courtyard consisted of eight Smaller Courtyards, and above these was the Extreme Dan King Courtyard. Only Elder Dan had the qualifications to enter this courtyard!\u201cIf you can not win, then you will give all the original benefits you would receive from the Extreme Martial Sect over to Yao Haisheng, how about it?\u201d Elder Dan said with a sneer.Chen Xiang lightly smiled in response. \u201cAlright, If I can get first not only will I get to visit a nice place, but also receive an apprentice.\u201d\u201cYou can never win! I earned first place for the last five consecutive years! You still have a long way to go.\u201d Yao Haisheng coldly smiled, and it was as if he was foreseeing Chen Xiang\u2019s miserable defeat.The matter of Elder Dan making things difficult for Chen Xiang was known to everyone in the Extreme Martial Sect. But now that Chen Xiang had entered the Inner Sect and received abundant resources, Elder Dan actually tried to cut these supplies off. n.o.body expected that Chen Xiang would actually readily agree to such a thing.\u201cYouths are always like this, they can never admit defeat. Someday they will suffer and pay the price.\u201d Wu Kaiming, after learning of this bet could not help but lament, \u201cI say Elder Dan, this brat clearly intended to please you by openly gifting two Azure Profound Fruits, why would you still act against him?\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Elder Dan coldly snorted and said, \u201cThis brat has not suffered any losses by his supposed gift. When I refine the Foundation Building Dan, I need to expend other additional materials for refining. His Azure Profound Fruit was the rarest on the list which I had been looking for quite a long time to obtain. But I failed to find it and could only resign myself to accept this gift! If he really wanted to please me, he would not have requested me to refine two Foundation Building Dans for his pair of little sweethearts!\u201dWhen Wu Kaming heard this and he really thought about it once more, and he realized that regarding this matter, Elder Dan had indeed suffered a loss.\u201cI will definitely make him willingly bow his head towards me. If he admits his mistakes to me and apologizes, I can even take him as my apprentice!\u201d After Elder Dan finished speaking, she flew away.\"I'm afraid that this feisty girl will never get married.\" Wu Kaiming helplessly smiled.The Alchemy Compet.i.tion would start after three days and was held in the 8th Smaller Dan Courtyard. During these three days Chen Xiang secluded himself and went into closed door training. Others thought that he was preparing for the compet.i.tion, but they were very wrong. He was studying the spirit veins section in the Refining Weapon Scroll.\u201cSister Meiyao, Sister Youyou, regarding these types of spirit veins you two should understand better than I! These things are very profound and can produce all sorts of bizarre effects. What do you think would happen if I engrave these spirit veins onto a dan, or during alchemy internally carve the spirit veins?\u201dInside the ring Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were stunned speechless. They had never thought about such a thing. In their opinion, alchemy was just the process of congealing the dan by fusing various types of herbs, nothing more, nothing less.After Su Meiyao took a cold breath, she said, \u201cI do not know but you should try! But in order to do so, you would need a very strong divine sense in order to quickly carve the spirit veins while congealing the dan. You would need an even more powerful divine sense if you want to carve it inside the dan.\u201d\u201cCorrect, furthermore you would need to carve suitable spirit veins! My teacher once said that there were some spirit runes which had the same effects as dans in ancient times. If such spirit runes were to be engraved onto the dantian, it would allow one to quickly gather a large amount of True Qi. If it was attached onto someone\u2019s arm, that part would gain fearsome strength.\u201d Bai Youyou said.Chen Xiang was secretly elated by the news. If he was truly successful in creating spirit runes onto dans, it would help him improve the effect of dans by several times in the future without having to use precious spirit herbs! However, he currently had too little understanding of the spirit runes.Three days past but Chen Xiang was left without anything to show for it. These spirit runes were just too complicated and required a huge amount of mental power to a.n.a.lyze, memorize and grasp the information contained within them which was simply impossible to do in such a short period of time.This alchemy compet.i.tion was just a small scale event held once a year. However a large grand compet.i.tion was held every ten years. At that time, not only would all the alchemists in the Extreme Martial Sect partic.i.p.ate, but also alchemists throughout the entire Extreme Martial Province would travel here to partic.i.p.ate in this major event.Many people were uninterested in watching the process of an alchemy compet.i.tion because it was relatively tedious. Unless it was a grand compet.i.tion, in that case the scene was not only spectacular but also lively, furthermore occasionally there were some funny scenes that occurred.\u201cElder brother Chen, you can do it! We will be waiting for you here 10 days later!\u201d This time around Yun Xiaodao was concerned about Chen Xiang because of the giant bet. Although he said he would definitely win the compet.i.tion, if he lost, he would be losing big time.Elder Dan arrived and coldly stated, \u201cChen Xiang, your alchemy process will be supervised by me! I heard that you had won 1000 True Qi Dan and this is to prevent you from cheating, which is probably the only way you can win!\u201dChen Xiang helplessly sighed, \u201cElder Dan, there are only 700 of those True Qi Dans remaining. I gave 100 to Yun Xiaodao and sold 200 to Zhu Rong and Zhang De. Here, I\u2019ll give you the remaining 700 True Qi Dan for custody so you cannot accuse me of cheating.\u201dChen Xiang readily pa.s.sed over the seven boxes which made Elder Dan surprised. When others found out that Chen Xiang had 700 True Qi Dan on him, they could not help but stare at him with envy. Yet despite this, they did not dare to even think of fighting Chen Xiang. Even though there was a great disparity in their strength, if the Extreme Martial Sect were to find out about their actions their peaceful days would come to an end.Elder Dan opened the jade boxes and confirmed there was 700 True Qi dans inside them. Afterwards, she placed them inside her own storage bracelet, only at the Elder level would one have such a sophisticated and beautiful storage equipment.Elder Dan also wanted to take a look at how Chen Xiang planned to refine the True Qi Dan in the end. She also did not believe that Chen Xiang would be able to refine them at his young age.The compet.i.tion started as each person got their own personal room which was in turn guarded by a disciple. Moreover, their entire alchemy process were being transmitted to the Elder Courtyard which was being intensely supervised by a few old men so that no one could win by cheating.Chen Xiang learned that the fastest someone had refined a set of True Qi Dan was half an hour. However, if he used the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, he would be able to refine two sets of True Qi Dan herbs in half an hour. In order to make it less shocking, he intended to tone it down and refine one set of herbs per hour, plus like this he was able to be more relaxed.Elder Dan opened Chen Xiang\u2019s Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace and apart from being very beautiful and forged by good material, she did not find anything strange about it. The only person who should know about its uses was the Brilliant Furnace's chosen master, otherwise Meng Bo would have never casually taken out this alchemy furnace and use it as gambling stakes.\u201cElder Dan, how long does it generally take you to refine one set of True Qi Dan herbs? Also, how many dans can you produce in one set?\u201d Chen Xiang asked.\u201cThe fastest I can refine would be two sets of herbs in one and half hour. The highest amount of dans in the furnace would be six dans, but then the time of refining would be extended.\u201d Elder Dan truthfully answered. She was also relatively proud of these results. At her level, alchemists were not always refining high level dans, sometimes the Sect lacked low level dans and they needed to act as well.When refining high level dans, they would go into seclusion. Elder Dan had not gone into seclusion for many years because she had been collecting herbs.The herbs used in this compet.i.tion was paid for by the Extreme Martial Sect, but if they failed to refine anything they needed to repay the Sect with crystal stones. That was why everyone was being even more careful than usual when refining. They did not dare to refine too quickly because they fear its repercussions, but Chen Xiang had the heaven defying Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace. If he intended to go fast, he would go fast. If he wanted to approach the limit of his refinement speed, he would be able to refine three sets of True Qi Dan herbs in half an hour!Elder Dan saw Chen Xiang skillfully dealing with the herbs without even taking a glance at them, while at the same time processing multiple sets at once. The amount for each set was uniform and not the least bit off or different. His speed was so quick that it made people suck their tongues. Only people who had vast amounts of experience in refining would be able to do such a thing, even inside the Extreme Martial Sect only a few old men could do this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seventeen years old, and already capable of refining a Low-Grade Spirit Level Dan. This came a shock to her, and also she felt that she had finally met someone since her birth that she could truly consider a genius. It was also the first time she had heard of a genius of this level!Elder Dan was silent, and seriously looking at Chen Xiang refining, but the next scene made her vomit blood. Chen Xiang, while actually refining, was also diverting his attention to organize the herbs.\"You have already refined this dan?\" Elder Dan could sense the flame trans.m.u.ting inside the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace. The flame would suddenly become large then suddenly small, and these subtle changes were very difficult to detect. She almost wasn't able to sense these subtle changes, and it could be clearly seen that Chen Xiang's ability to control fire was just superb.Chen Xiang unenthusiastically said, \"Alchemy is too boring and consumes a lot of time. Only this way it can be a little interesting.\"\"Don't you fear that your furnace will explode? Diverting the mind in two places like this can easily lead to failure!\" Elder Dan snorted.\"Hei hei, I'm currently using my mind in three places. One side for refining the dan, another side on organizing the herbs, and also talking to you!\" Chen Xiang said while laughing, and listening to this Elder Dan could not wait to give him a beating, but she also clearly knew while refining dans how tedious and boring it could be.Chen Xiang slowed down his tempo, and he could only use the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace like this if he was familiar with the process of refining the dan. He could divert his mind to several places, and this was not only due to the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, but also because he mainly relied on his subtle sense of alchemy. This sense was his talent, otherwise, he would never be able to learn alchemy so easily!All the materials were with Elder Dan, and she first gave Chen Xiang only ten sets, waiting for him to completely refine them, but Chen Xiang had quickly organized them. In this little private room ten square boxes were placed on the ground, which were the herbs for refining the True Qi Dans.\"Elder Dan, at my age, if I enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard, then what are the advantages? Like what will I receive?\" Chen Xiang asked, and thinking that he could live together with the mysterious Elder Dan for ten days or so in his heart, he was inexplicably excited.\"If you really can enter, then it certainly will be beneficial, but it would also depend on me because the Extreme Dan Courtyard is managed by me.\" Elder Dan said with a low chuckle.\"Elder Dan, how about I give you a little h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s and we forget past matters and start anew. How does that sound?\u201d After Elder Dan\u2019s mysterious hatred Chen Xiang did not have good days.\"We never had any hatred between us! I am just doing this due to my preferences.\" Elder Dan said.Chen Xiang sighed and said, \"I will use the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s for one answer, and you tell me why you hate me! As you previously said, as long as I win, you'll tell me, but I can not wait for that time.\"\"Although the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s is very precious, but for me it not rare.\" Elder Dan said with a cold snort.\"Why are you doing this?\" Chen Xiang had no words, he suddenly felt Elder Dan was angry with him, and this is simple like a mentality of a little girl. He had once suspected whether or not he was a lookalike of an enemy of Elder Dan, and that was why she was hating him like this.\"Admit your mistake to me, and yield to me! If you do so then I'll be satisfied, and perhaps I can even receive you as my apprentice!\" In Elder Dan\u2019s voice there was some pride in it, and she felt soon she would see this stubborn youth be shrewdly under her skirt.\"Dream on! Even in death I'll not!\" After this Chen Xiang didn't pay any attention to Elder Dan, and only felt somewhat strange because Elder Dan was obviously doing this in a fit of anger which was simply like the mentality of a little girl.More than an hour past by, Chen Xiang opened the alchemy furnace, and took out six purple dans and put it in a jade box, then once again placed the herbs inside the Brilliant Flame Dragon Furnace, continuing to refine more True Qi Dans.His actions were very casual, and looked similar to how roadside steam bun sellers steamed their buns, however, Elder Dan who watched this was very surprised, because Chen Xiang was truly able to refine True Qi Dans. Moreover it only took him one hour for refine one set of herbs, and using one set he was able to refine six dans. Only if refined out gingerly, so that no herbs would be wasted while refining, would one be able to congeal six dans. This would also take some time and also consumed a lot of one\u2019s spirit!But Chen Xiang did this so leisurely! Elder Dan remained silent, and watching Chen Xiang\u2019s casual appearance, in her heart she was not too happy. After watching this refinement of one set of herbs by Chen Xiang, she was clear that the ultimate winner was likely to be Chen Xiang.Chen Xiang did not pay any attention to Elder Dan, and even when Elder Dan asked him, he only casually responded with a few words. It seemed he was angry, and this made Elder Dan secretly clench her teeth.More than one hour later and another set of herbs were refined out once again. Chen Xiang, for the entire day and night, did not rest and kept on refining True Qi Dans. One day later, Chen Xiang had refined out eleven set of herbs. This speed made Elder Dan speechless due to surprise, and Chen Xiang did not even fail once!In the eyes of Chen Xiang, refining True Qi Dan now was like making rice b.a.l.l.s, but among the Low-Grade Spirit Level Dans, he only knew how to refine the True Qi Dan. The other dans required a lot of herbs, and currently he didn\u2019t have a lot of crystal stones so he could not afford the consumption of herbs.Ten days soon went by and Chen Xiang refined a total of a hundred set of herbs, in which he also rested for sometime, which came to a grand total of 600 True Qi Dans! This alchemy speed in the entire Extreme Martial Province was definitely first, and if Chen Xiang was willing to help some family to refine True Qi Dans, he would definitely earn a lot of crystal stones very quickly!At the end of the compet.i.tion, Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rong both quickly arrived, and they saw Chen Xiang had a relaxed expression. In their hearts they felt a little strange as in their opinion, Chen Xiang is should not be able to win.\u201cBrother Yao, you really made this old man not be able to hold a candle against you. In just in ten days you actually refined out 400 True Qi Dans! More than fifty last year so this year the first place position should belong to you.\" One old man with a look of respect was looking at Yao Haisheng.Yao Haisheng\u2019s face was filled with pride, but he modestly smiled and said, \"Ha ha, this is all due to luck. Besides, I and that brat, who doesn't know immensity of heaven and earth, had a bet so I did everything I can do in order to win!\"\"Yao Haisheng, previously you said as long as you lost to me, you will be my apprentice, do these words still count?\" Chen Xiang walked over and smiled.\"Of course it counts, you speak as if you have beaten me!\" You Haisheng laughingly said, \"If this is true, this is the funniest joke I\u2019ve heard of! Even if you can continuously refine ten days, that also makes me a little surprised.\"This time others one after another revealed how many True Qi Dan they each refined, and except for Yao Haisheng, the maximum others refined was about 200 or so, while the minimum was 30 dans. Not many people had partic.i.p.ated, only about 30 people, and each of them were relatively good alchemists inside the Extreme Dan Courtyard.Yao Haisheng and other alchemists all laughed at Chen Xiang, but Elder Dan\u2019s words in the next moment made their smile freeze.\"Yao Haisheng, you lost! This brat refined 600 True Qi Dans!\" Elder Dan said, and in her voice there was a trace of hatred, because it was not the result she wanted to see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 Receiving an Apprentice\u201cHei hei, Elder Dan you are very kind! I thought that you were intentionally and superficially making things difficult for me.\u201d Chen Xiang let loose a deep breath and afterwards took out six jade boxes, each one containing 100 True Qi Dans.The courtyard became deathly silent. n.o.body could believe that Chen Xiang was actually able to refine 600 True Qi Dans in just ten days!Everyone had a look of suspicion in their eyes while looking at Elder Dan. For an instant, they suspected that Elder Dan had helped Chen Xiang cheat but then remembered that was completely impossible because of how much Elder Dan hated Chen Xiang.At this time, Elder Dan had seven jade boxes in her hand. These were the True Qi Dans she had previously confiscated. Afterwards, she opened all the boxes, and verified the contents showing everyone there was no cheating involved.\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t want to see this result, Chen Xiang has indeed refined out 600 True Qi Dans within ten days. He also only spent a total of 100 sets of materials!\u201d Elder Dan\u2019s words made everyone once again shudder.Only a hundred set of materials! This meant that Chen Xiang was able to refine out 6 dans every single time with only a single set of herbs!\u201cAbnormal freak!\u201d Zhu Rong spat out these words from his mouth. Yun Xiaodao\u2019s mouth actually started twitching. He had not expected to have such a heaven defying friend this close to him.Yao Haisheng\u2019s teeth was trembling, with wide open eyes he was staring at the True Qi Dans placed on the ground. As long as they were an alchemist, it was clear that these dans had been refined not too long ago. In addition with the heat emanating from a box, it was clear that the dans in that specific box had been refined two days ago!Yao Haisheng and the other alchemists could clearly determine that the True Qi Dan in the six boxes from Chen Xiang had been refined not too long ago. Moreover, they were all of very high quality, no, all of them were top grade quality!Elder Dan coldly said, \u201cNow do you believe me? I have to admit, this fellow\u2019s level of alchemy is very high, even I can not accomplish such a feat. Each and every one of his True Qi Dans is top grade quality. It was also refined out in such a short time with each set of herbs producing six dans!\u201dYao Haisheng suddenly shuddered. His eyes had turned red and his heart felt literally dead. However, towards Chen Xiang he had now had nothing but admiration. What could he do when even Elder Dan had admitted defeat?At the very next instant, Yao Haisheng knelt down and knocked his head down towards Chen Xiang, thunderously shouting, \u201cTeacher! Please accept this disciple's salute!\u201dSeeing such a sluate from Yao Haisheng, many alchemist almost waddled. They very eagerly gave themselves two slaps, wanting to check whether or not they were dreaming!An alchemist of the True Martial Realm had just taken a teacher who was in the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, furthermore he was a youth. This was simply a joke, the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s biggest and most ridiculous joke.Chen Xiang was also startled, he had not expected Yao Haisheng to so readily take him as a teacher. This was due in part to the presence of Elder Dan and the other alchemists. Yao Haisheng could not afford to lose the trust of others, he might get cursed behind his back and for him that was worse than death!Yun Xiaodao vigorously pinched Zhu Rong\u2019s fat hand, making him emit a horrible shriek.\u201cHaha\u2026. It\u2019s not a dream. Elder brother Chen has won!\u201d Yun Xiaodao burst into laughter. Zhu Rong also took a deep breath before accepting this absurd reality.\u201cHei hei, apprentice please rise!\u201d Chen Xiang said with a depraved laugh as he walked towards Yao Haisheng and helped him stand up.At this point in time, Yao Haisheng\u2019s sadness was difficult to describe. He had not expected that he would ever take the one person he hated the most as his teacher. This might make him be unable to ever raise his head high ever again.\u201cThis is my gift to you!\u201d Chen Xiang said as he gave Yao Haisheng 100 True Qi Dan and an Azure Profound Fruit!This gift of his made everyone petrified. Their gazes instantly gathered onto the Azure Profound Fruit! Almost everyone here was an alchemist, who in the world would be unable to recognize the Azure Profound Fruit, this precious and extremely rare spirit herb!?Little gift!? The Azure Profound Fruit as a little gift!? This was simple too huge a blow for them!Both of Yao Haisheng\u2019s hands were trembling as he took the so called \u2018little gift\u2019 from Chen Xiang. He was originally deeply sad, however he felt much better now. At least doing this little obeisance to Chen Xiang as his teacher was not all that bad. He was no fool and knew that Chen Xiang intended to resolve the conflict between them!\u201cThanks\u2026 a lot.......... Teacher!\u201d said Yao Haisheng somewhat choppily.\u201cChen Xiang, here is your first reward! Early morning tomorrow report to the Extreme Dan King Courtyard. If you are late, wait and accept the punishment!\u201d Elder Dan threw a small jaded box to Chen Xiang before going to the other alchemists who took out their respective refined True Qi Dans.\u201cElder Dan, can I choose to not enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard?\u201d Chen Xiang was worried that he would be oppressed there by this mysterious Elder Dan turning his life miserable.\u201cThat won\u2019t do! It was an agreed bet between you and me. If you refuse and violate this then you will have to leave the Extreme Martial Sect!\u201d a cold snort from Elder Dan resounded.Chen Xiang sighed bitterly. He suddenly felt that he did not gain any benefits from the bet between him and Elder Dan.\u201cHaisheng, although I am now your teacher, at best I can only refine True Qi Dan. Maybe later I will even have to ask some advice from you. There is no need to refer to me as your teacher, instead just simply call me by my name. I will wait for the day when you are sincerely convinced I have the qualifications for you to call me teacher. At that time, you can once again address me as such.\u201d Chen Xiang said.Having Yao Haisheng call him teacher everyday, even Chen Xiang felt a little sorry. Not to mention what Yao Haisheng was probably feeling.Regarding this point, Yao Haisheng was also quite grateful. He knew from now on he could not act against Chen Xiang otherwise he would be severely punished.Long before Chen Xiang entered the Inner Sect, his fame had spread throughout the entire Extreme Martial Sect. Now, not only did he win the alchemy compet.i.tion, but he was also allowed to enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard making Chen Xiang even more famous!Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao returned to their martial courtyard. While they were walking on the road, Yun Xiaodao suddenly said with a smile, \u201cElder brother Chen, do you remember not too long ago how I spoke about having a few very nice sisters?\u201dChen Xiang nodded, \u201cI do, but you also said they would despise me and treat me like dirt.\u201d\u201cHow could I even say such a thing seriously? It was just a joke! Either way, I\u2019ll arrange for you and them to meet face to face. You\u2019re still single, you can simply get married!\u201d Yun Xiaodao said with a depraved smile on his face. That way, he would be able to get a brother-in-law with boundless prospects which was a very good thing.\u201cTch, my fiancee is Xue Xianxian! If these sisters of yours want to marry me they would first have to get permission from her!\u201d Chen Xiang pursed his lips and said. Currently he just wanted to quickly enter the True Martial Realm and go searching for Xue Xianxian.\u201cBrother-in-law come on! Although my sisters are not nearly as talented as Xue Xianxian they are all really pretty!\u201d To Chen Xiang\u2019s surprise Yun Xiaodao actually called him brother-in-law already.Zhu Rong witnessing this could not help but stop himself and give Yun Xiaodao a nice kick. \u201cAlthough your sisters really are rather pretty, at the same time each and every one of them are br.i.m.m.i.n.g with pride and arrogance! There is no way brother Chen would like them!\u201d\u201cYounger brother Chen, I also have a sister, and her talent is also not bad! Her appearance is also much better than this rascal\u2019s sisters, those prudish tarts!\u201d Zhu Rong\u2019s chubby face was filled to the brim with a smile, \u201cMy dear brother-in-law, at what time do you want to go for a stroll within our Zhu Family?\u201d\u201cDead Pig, you and I must fight!\u201d Yun Xiaodao angrily said.Watching this dramatic play from Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rong, Chen Xiang secretly thought that it would be great to never meet these younger and elder sisters of theirs. Especially Zhu Rong\u2019s, maybe his sister would be like him and be a heavyweight level female!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 Heavenly Dragon TreasureChen Xiang\u2019s att.i.tude became very resolute. His refusal to Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rong was akin to a solid war fortress regarding their meetings with their younger and elder female relatives.Barely before the dawn of the next day, Chen Xiang hastily entered the Mysterious Realm. Though he knew that the Extreme Dan King Courtyard was inside but he did not know the path to it.\u201cWell, you came quite early! Come with me.\u201d Wu Kaming said with a happy smile. Regarding Chen Xiang, Wu Kaiming was very interested. Originally, Elder Dan had forbidden anyone to receive Chen Xiang as their apprentice but now not only did he get himself a True Martial Realm apprentice, he also obtained the permission to enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard.Chen Xiang did not know what it meant to enter the Extreme Dan King Courtyard but Wu Kaiming knew very well what it meant!The Extreme Dan King Courtyard had the simple appearance of a very ordinary house. Above the entrance was \u201cExtreme Dan King Courtyard\u201d (\u592a\u4e39\u738b\u9662) only these four characters and nothing else out of the ordinary\u201cElder Wu, in the end just what kind of place is the Extreme Dan King Courtyard?\u201d Chen Xiang asked.\u201cHei Hei, you will know once you go inside! I will take my leave now, take care!\u201d Wu Kaiming\u2019s smile was very mysterious. Seeing this, Chen Xiang had a bad premonition for the near future.The Spirit Qi inside the Mysterious Realm was very rich. Chen Xiang felt that if he stayed here for a bit, he would definitely be able to cultivate a large amount of True Qi. But no matter how much faster this process was, it was still incomparable to the speed when he cultivated using pills.\u201cYou came quite early! Were you brought in by Elder Wu?\u201d The sound of Elder\u2019s Dan\u2019s voice came from close by.Chen Xiang walked towards the sound and replied, \u201cYes. What exactly do you want me to do here in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only person who stays here in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard. Now, you will also stay here!\u201d Elder Dan responded, her tone was extremely serious.\u201cWhy?\u201d Chen Xiang was very shocked in his heart. He was going to stay here everyday alone with her, this would definitely not be a good thing!\u201cI\u2019m preparing to go behind closed doors for quite sometime in order to refine dans. You will call all the shots here in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard and essentially become its master!\u201d Elder Dan replied, \u201cYou do not have to do much here, after all there are already specialists who are responsible for planting the spirit herbs. Regarding all the other matters, they are also managed by someone. The only important thing you need to do is maintain the dignity of the Extreme Dan King Courtyard! As to how this goes, you will naturally understand later.\u201dChen Xiang was dazed for a brief second. He had never expected Elder Dan to trust him with such an important matter. Considering her words, Elder Dan probably did not hate him that much.\"Was it all due to something I\u2019ve done? Or.. did she do it all in a fit of anger???\" Chen Xiang arrived at a somewhat funny conclusion.Chen Xiang sucked in a mouth full of air and asked, \"Elder Dan, about those Foundation Building Dans...\"\"How much time did you think it would take? I have already refined it and sent it to the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire and Icewind Valley.\" Elder Dan\u2019s tone was somewhat angry when she replied. She had not expected Chen Xiang to actually still be worried about this issue.Chen Xiang nodded his head in reply and said with a smile, \u201cThan thanks a lot Elder Dan! You can rest a.s.sured and head behind closed doors to refine dans!\u201d\u201cChen Xiang, I\u2019ll ask you once again. Are you willing to take me as your teacher? You should know that I have never received an apprentice!\u201d Elder Dan asked. A sliver of gentleness could be found in her voice.Chen Xiang shook his head. \u201cNo, besides haven\u2019t you already stated that you would make life difficult for anyone who received me as an apprentice? If you were to take me as your apprentice, would you not have to make life difficult for yourself?\u201d\u201cHumph, as you wis.h.!.+\u201d Elder Dan took out a jade card and hurled it towards Chen Xiang before storming away.Chen Xiang caught the jade card and carefully look at it. Above the card, there were actually hair like patterns which he recognized as spirit veins! Furthermore there was also a trace of a unknown power. Above this jade card, a set of words were written, \"Extreme Dan King Courtyard, Chen Xiang\"!From then on, Chen Xiang was the only one living inside the Extreme Dan King Courtyard, but he also had a large amount of freedom.Ever since he received Yao Haisheng as his apprentice, Yao Haisheng rarely appeared. He claimed it was because he needed to go into seclusion for alchemy. In reality, he was just trying to escape because he did not have the face to see others since he had taken Chen Xiang as his teacher.Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao rarely went to visit the 329th Martial Courtyard, but they were still members of this Martial Courtyard. What made them a bit surprised was that Zhu Rong actually gave up the lucrative benefits of the 200th Martial Courtyard and went to live with Chen Xiang and the others. His reason for doing so was to better persuade Chen Xiang to meet his sister.In this way, Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao, along with Zhu Rong, this stingy fatty, became friends. Though they often cursed at each other, they had very good brotherly feelings towards each other.\u201cElder brother Chen, we\u2019ve been waiting for you for quite some time!\u201d Yun Xiaodao, upon seeing Chen Xiang walk into the martial courtyard hastily jumped up. Because Chen Xiang now resided in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard inside the Mysterious Realm, Zhu Rong and Yun Xiaodao did not have the liberty to enter it. Although they had something to discuss with Chen Xiang, they could not look for him.\"What is it?\" Chen Xiang asked.Zhu Rong was waving a sheet in his hand and helplessly said, \u201cYes, well due to the careful selection of this little rascal Yun, we received a very boring and nonsensical task.\u201dChen Xiang now remembered that it has already been one month since he entered the Inner Sect and they needed to perform a task arranged by the sect. In this one month, he had learned some new martial skills along with the water attributed [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise]. While the majority of these were more defensive oriented martial skills, and there was only one or two different types, it had made Chen Xiang very satisfied with his progress.Chen Xiang was just thinking about asking about the task at hand when Yun Xiaodao laughed and said, \u201cThis is one very good task, it\u2019s about the matter of the Heavenly Dragon Treasure.\u201dHeavenly Dragon Treasure! It was one of the most recent matters that caused major uproar these past ten days. This was an treasure from the ancient times. A dragon had fell on the Chenwu Mainland and left it, and along with it appeared the emergence of rumors about a map regarding the Heavenly Dragon Treasure. But this map was also very expensive, and was around 100,000 crystal stones for a copy!At first the majority of people thought it was fake and someone only put forth this false information to earn some crystal stones. But after detailed a.n.a.lysis by some elders, the place marked as the treasure was indeed the location where the dragon inside the legend had once appeared.That place was called Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains and could be regarded as a dangerous area!\u201cHow can there be any Heavenly Dragon Treasures? When the rumor had not even appeared our Zhu Family searched the place thoroughly and it didn\u2019t have farts!\u201d Zhu Rong contemptuously said.\u201cHumph, my Yun Family had already searched over a hundred years before your Zhu Family ever went to search!\u201d Yun Xiaodao said.Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains containing a mystical treasure, this was a legend from long ago. Many people had gone to search for it but no one found anything.Chen Xiang took the paper from Yun Xiaodao and looked at the map. As well as the details from the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s explanation of the task, they were responsible for investigating whether or not it was true, and for reporting any further information before the task could be considered finished.\u201cAlthough it may be a rumor, it is also a very easy thing to do. We can almost treat it as playing around! However, I heard that many individuals from major sects have also arrived to search for it. Not only it has caused commotion in the Extreme Martial Province, but it is same for all the other provinces!\u201d\u201cThere truly are many idiots, so many have come rus.h.i.+ng here from afar!\u201d Zhu Rong laughed.\u201cCome on, so many people are heading over here so there is a high chance that it might be true! Previously, your family had not found anything there. Maybe it was because there was a Mysterious Realm there, you also know about Mysterious Realms right?The ways any Mysterious Realm appeared were extremely special. Sometimes it suddenly appeared out of nowhere, other times someone needed to fulfill certain conditions for an entrance to appear. There were also some cases where a very strong power was needed to forcefully rip open the pa.s.sage...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 Peerless Martial SectJust when Chen Xiang was determined to go, an old woman who was wearing an ordinary dress suddenly appeared.\u201cXiaodao, due to some matters within your family, you need to take a trip back!\u201d This woman was Yun Xiaodao\u2019s teacher, a martial artist of the True Martial Realm!Yun Xiaodao had a look of reluctance. If it wasn\u2019t for the strength of this old woman, he would definitely not go back. However, he now had to clench his teeth and leave with the old woman.\u201cElder brother Chen, this time I\u2019ll have to request you to help out! Next time I\u2019ll help you with your task!\u201d This was the statement Yun Xiaodao left behind.\u201cYounger brother Chen, as you find it very interesting you can go by yourself. I do not intend to join in on the fun and also request you to do so\u2026\u201d The instant Zhu Rong finished speaking he left before Chen Xiang could even blink. He did not expect this fatty\u2019s speed to be so quick.Chen Xiang let out a snort before folding the map and leaving the Extreme Martial Sect. The Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s a.s.signed tasks were generally completed by several disciples of a martial courtyard. However, regardless of how many people go it was all fine as long as the matter was resolved.Pers.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountain was located at one of the border areas of the Extreme Martial Province. It was relatively close to the borders of the Beast Martial Province which was the site of the Beast Martial Sect. In this province, there were relatively more demon beasts, however, the majority of these were being raised by the disciples of the Beast Martial Sect in a cage as pets. The martial skills they learned and practiced were also invariably connected with the demon beasts.The road Chen Xiang needed to take was very far, but he sped things up by using the [Vermillion Bird Fire Wings] to fly at night, and this allowed him to quickly cross many mountain forests.Ten days past by as Chen Xiang made a long and wearisome journey before finally arriving at Guanlong City. From here, the distance to the Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains was not that far. Recently many people had gathered here. After Chen Xiang asked around, he came to know why so many people believed in the legendary Heavenly Dragon Treasure!This was because one month ago, many people in Guanlong City saw a strange and unique aura appear in the direction of the Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains which was followed by a dragon\u2019s roar coming from the horizon. This kind of thing was very likely to be the sign of the opening of a Mysterious Realm.After coming here, Chen Xiang also learned some Extreme Martial Sect related information. A martial arts sect, called the Peerless Martial Sect, had been incorporated and fused with the Extreme Martial Sect along with all of their disciples!The Peerless Martial Sect was another 1st Cla.s.s Sect and was ranked just behind the Chenwu Mainland\u2019s eight major Righteous Sects. It could also be considered as one of the strongest rising stars and had been established at the coastal areas of the Extreme Martial Province. Unfortunately, the entire Peerless Martial Sect had been swallowed up by the sea and the suffered very heavy losses. In order to continue the development of their disciples, the Peerless Martial Sect\u2019s Dean seeked the majority of the disciple's agreement before incorporating themselves into the Extreme Martial Sect.The Peerless Martial Sect\u2019s Dean originally had some relations with the Extreme Martial Sect and their marital skills had actually stemmed from them! Since it had accepted the help of the Extreme Martial Sect, being incorporated into the larger Sect was not a bad thing for them and could even be considered a joyful mother.\u201cMotherf.u.c.ker, just what kind of s.h.i.+tty task did this father come here to complete!? The Extreme Martial Sect is actually holding a large scale banquet here for the Peerless Martial Sect and giving them a large welcoming dinner!\u201d Chen Xiang thinking about this secretly cursed in his heart.As for the Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s disciples it was also a joyful matter. This was because in the entirety of the Peerless Martial Sect\u2019s disciples there was a good number of female disciples. The Extreme Martial Sect had modified their sect rules and were now willing to take female disciples so that the Peerless Martial Sect could be comfortably integrated into the Extreme Martial Sect.Chen Xiang also thought that the Inner Martial Courtyard would no longer have a lifeless appearance now. If it was not for the arrival of Zhu Rong, then the Inner Martial Courtyard Chen Xiang was staying in would only have two disciples!Chen Xiang had spent a few days in Guanlong City asking and recording information from his surveys.\u201cTwo sisters, should I go take a look at the Heavenly Dragon Treasure?\u201d Chen Xiang asked. He learned that there were a lot of True Martial Realm experts from other sects that came here. He was sure that if a little shrimp of the 9th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm were to go he would be unable to even see a glimpse of the treasure.\u201cGo and take a look! Although it's almost impossible to get anything, it will introduce a new perspective and present a new outlook on the world for you, it will not be bad for you.\u201d Bai Youyou replied.Su Meiyao also similarly agreed, \u201cIf it really is a Mysterious Realm then maybe you can fish up something, but in the case that you sense that something isn\u2019t right, escape immediately.\u201dChen Xiang nodded his head, he had already completed the task at this point. Now he only thought of going to take a look and nothing more.After leaving Guanlong City, Chen Xiang entered into a patch of jungle. Like everyone else, he did not walk on the road because he knew that there existed some good herbs in the Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains. He thought of taking a slight detour to see if he could chance upon some good herbs.Soon after entering inside the mountain forest, Chen Xiang discovered a set of demon beast footprints. From observing the footprints, he concluded that the overall ma.s.s of the demon beast was definitely not small which made him somewhat curious. He had not hunted or killed demon beasts after leaving the Extreme Martial Sect. Besides, he also knew that demon beasts were good at finding spirit herbs, if he tracked it down then maybe something good would be waiting for him.Chen Xiang followed the footprints as more than three hour pa.s.sed. The sky had turned dark, but he could still clearly see everything inside the forest.And in the distance he saw a black lion as tall as human!When Chen Xiang had been residing in the Inner Courtyard Regular Hall, he read a book about demon beasts. This black lion was a very ferocious Grade-10 demon beast, and also had a great chance to evolve into a spirit beast, it was called the Night Hunting Lion!\u201cWho is it?\u201d A cold and tender shout resounded. Chen Xiang saw the Night Hunting Lion from the top of a tree before jumping down. A girl had been sitting on the Night Hunting Lion\u2019s back and looked around with a ruthless and arrogant gaze.At this moment, Chen Xiang went into hiding behind the tree. He was greatly startled because he just saw what the Night Hunting Lion was eating a moment ago\u2026 It turned out to be some humans!\u201cBeast Martial Sect\u2019s disciples\u2026 No one had ever thought that they were using human corpses for feeding their demon beasts!\u201d Chen Xiang secretly thought. Although he was far away, he could still see the civilian attire on the human corpse.It was easy for a martial arts sect\u2019s disciple to casually kidnap some civilians, however Chen Xiang saw dozens of human bodies just a moment ago!Chen Xiang clenched his fists tightly. He was an Extreme Martial Sect\u2019s disciple and they were responsible for protecting the Extreme Martial Province. Yet now their civilians were actually being grabbed by Beast Martial Sect Disciples for the food of their demon beasts, how could he not be furious?If this matter were to spread out, it would make all the citizens throughout the entire Extreme Martial Sect furious beyond belief!Chen Xiang went out and walked towards the Night Hunting Lion with a cold look on his face. As he coldly glared at the girl sitting on the back of the Night Hunting Lion he thought this girl was extremely hideous despite her pretty appearance!\u201cWho is it? Quickly show yourself or I\u2019ll treat you just like these mortals and make you food for Little Black!\u201d The girl loudly shouted before taking out a long sword.\u201cBEAST SHUT YOUR f.u.c.kING MOUTH!\u201dSeeing the Night Hunting Lion chewing on human flesh Chen Xiang felt anger seeping through his veins and into his heart. True Qi gushed out from beneath his feet and he instantly leapt right next to the Night Hunting Lion. Like lighting his finger shot out. That fingertip was surging and was coated in invisible Universal True Qi, which directly penetrated the Night Hunting Lion\u2019s skull!In that one blow of his, Chen Xiang not only casted the [Profound Aura Finger] but did so with Universal True Qi. Blood madly gushed out from the little hole that had been punchered by his finger on the stark head of the Night Hunting Lion.[TLN: We have used Peerless Martial Sect instead of Peerless Sect \u65e0\u53cc\u95e8 to have more better flow]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 Powerful EnemyWhen the girl saw the blood spewing out from the hole she couldn\u2019t help but emit a sharp shriek. On the other hand, the Night Hunting Lion let out one last howl before falling down to her surprise.\u201cGO DIE!\u201d Chen Xiang hurled a lightning fast fist that had a huge white tiger\u2019s head on its end. Seemingly endless amounts of Slaughter Qi covered his body. That death seeking fist hammered onto the Night Hunting Lion\u2019s giant head as it burst with a thunderous sound that was followed by the trembling of the ground beneath it.The [White Tiger Divine Fists] carried seemingly endless amounts of Slaughter Qi and obliterated any Life Qi from the Night Hunting Lion which erased any functions of life that was still present in it. In laymen\u2019s terms, the Night Hunting Lion was dead.Chen Xiang released flames onto the corpses littered on the ground and cremated them before coldly turning to glare at the trembling azure gown girl.The Night Hunting Lion\u2019s body fell and heavily hit the ground. The charming face of that azure gowned girl suddenly twisted, \u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d\u201cI killed this beast!\u201d Chen Xiang coldly replied. \u201cYour Beast Martial Sect was actually doing these kinds of things in the Extreme Martial Province. I will definitely report this matter to the Extreme Martial Sect!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you are an Extreme Martial Sect Disciple?\u201d That azure gowned girl\u2019s eyebrows twitched while she asked this in a vicious tone.\"Yes!\" Chen Xiang replied.\u201cMy Little Black only ate a few mortals yet your Extreme Martial Sect is going to interfere? For us this kind of thing is extremely common! Those few mortal lives\u2026 Even ten thousand of them would not be comparable with my Little Black! Yet you actually killed Little Black for the sake of these mortals! I\u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d The azure gowned girl\u2019s face had turned blue and her entire body was trembling from anger.Chen Xiang brow wrinkled, to his surprise the Beast Martial Sect Disciples often did such things, this made him even more angry!\u201cHumph! Don\u2019t you know this is the Extreme Martial Province? When I report this matter to the Extreme Martial Sect just wait to see what happens to your Beast Martial Sect!\u201d Chen Xiang said.\u201cYou will not be able to go back!\u201d From far away a husky voice came. A black silhouette flashed into sight and appeared in front of the azure gowned girl. It was a middle aged woman with a plain appearance wearing a black robe.A True Martial Realm Expert! Chen Xiang clenched his fists, he had not expected there would be such an expert hiding around here. In the next moment, he was able to tell that the black robed woman was either the azure gowned girl\u2019s mother or her teacher.What made Chen Xiang frightened was that the black robed woman actually had a snake with a red skull twining around her arm. It was a flat headed snake with black scales, and this was a rare spirit beast called the Soul Tracking Snake! Its strength was around the True Martial Realm and its poison was even more terrifying.\u201cTeacher\u2026 Teacher, he killed my Little Black! I want his fate to be worse than death\u2026 I want to mow on his flesh bit by bit!\u201d The azure gowned girl said with hatred, ruthlessly glaring towards Chen Xiang.\u201cIf you go back and inform the Extreme Martial Sect it will indeed become a disaster for us, but now you will not be able to return.\u201d Just as she finished speaking, the black robed woman transformed into a black shadow and appeared behind Chen Xiang\u2019s back and blasted out a palm.In that moment, Chen Xiang could feel the Five Zhang Six Fu within his body tighten while his meridians threatened to burst. A mouthful of blood gushed out from his mouth as his body flew towards the azure gowned girl.[TLN: Five Zhang Six Fu: Basically internal organs, however they are divided into yin and yang according to Chinese medicine, Five Zhang (YIN) Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney while Six Fu (YANG) Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder, Stomach and S\u0101njia\u014d]The azure gown girl drew her long sword and fiercely stabbed towards the incoming Chen Xiang. The blow penetrated his chest thoroughly, all the way through his back!Chen Xiang looked up only to see the azure gowned girl\u2019s ferocious eyes. She fiercely pulled out her long sword and proceeded to vigorously kick him in his abdomen making Chen Xiang fly onto the ground.Just a moment ago, Chen Xiang had been struck by the palm blow from the True Martial Realm black robed woman. He had been seriously injured and lost all of his strength. Just now did he truly realize how powerful True Martial Realm martial artists were. Their True Qi was much more vigorous than the 10th Level Mortal Martial Realm martial artists.The azure gown girl saw Chen Xiang could not move and proceeded to take out a small knife before walking towards Chen Xiang. \u201cI want to mow your flesh bit by bit.\u201dThe black robed woman did not take any action. Coldly looking on, she seemed very sure that Chen Xiang could not escape.Chen Xiang hated himself very much in his heart, he hated his own incompetence and the lack of strength. He vowed to himself that he would definitely kill the azure gown girl in front of him and the black robed woman who injured him!\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 remember both of you! Until you\u2019re dead this father will not rest!\u201d Chen Xiang suddenly roared. The black robed woman immediately responded as the snake on her arms flew out. But just before it reached Chen Xiang\u2019s body a large amount of water suddenly appeared in front it as it crashed into the wall of water.In that instant Chen Xiang casted [Water Wall] from the [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise]. The vigorous Black Tortoise True Qi transformed into a large amount of water which was currently spurting out and blocking the snake.After having done all this, the ground beneath Chen Xiang turned into a pool water, after which Chen Xiang disappeared below, and that pool of water vanished!\u201cTeacher\u2026 what kind of martial skill is this? What should we do?\u201d the azure gown girl was shocked and angrily asked.\u201cRest a.s.sured. When the time comes, we\u2019ll refuse to acknowledge these acts. That brat is just a little disciple of the Inner Sect while I\u2019m a True Disciple of the Beast Martial Sect who\u2019s reached the True Martial Realm! The Extreme Martial Sect will never believe that brat\u2019s words.\u201d The black robed woman sneered while stroking the red headed snake on her arm.What Chen Xiang displayed this time was a type of skill inside the [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise] called [Water Escape]. It was a very mystical martial skill and allowed a shoal of water to suddenly emerge out of the earth. The caster would then be carried by a whirlpool and enter into that water shoal as the whirlpool carried the caster deep into the ground. It would drill past the surface to create a pa.s.sage deep below the ground and carry the caster by a river stream to a place far away allowing the caster to escape.Just as Chen Xiang released all of his Black Tortoise True Qi, he congratulated himself for learning this move. Otherwise it would have been truly very difficult for him to escape that dire situation today.A small river was flowing on one side and Chen Xiang was lying on its sh.o.r.e. His whole body was drenched and he had a pale complexion. He looked lethargic as he took out a little bit of the h.e.l.l Spirit Gra.s.s and placed it in his mouth while barely conscious. He quickly recovered from his injuries and swallowed a few more healing dans.He soon regained some of his strength and was currently leaning against a tree near the river side and was resting.\u201cHow are you?\u201d Bai Youyou came out of the storage ring and gently asked.Su Meiyao came on wiped the stain off his face with concern and worry, saying \u201cBe careful next time. After you come out do not think like it will be the same as how the Extreme Martial Sect is, being safe everyday. The True Marital Realm experts inside the Extreme Martial Sect are bound by sect\u2019s rules otherwise they could kill you with just their fingertips!\u201dChen Xiang clenched his fists, his face filled with killing intent, \u201cI\u2019ll become stronger and definitely kill those two women!\u201d\u201cDon't you have four True Elemental Dan? Eat them!\u201d Bai Youoyu said.With the two beauties showing such a large amount of concern for him, Chen Xiang felt very warm inside his heart. He secretly decided that he would never make them worry again in the future, besides he was also their only hope!\"I'm sorry, I almost died!\" Chen Xiang guiltily said.\u201cNo problem, everythings fine as long as you\u2019re alive, just pay more attention next time!\u201d Bai Youyou said. Her tone seemed slightly thawed compared to the usual ice cold tone.\"Eat those 700 True Qi Dans and the four True Elemental Dans of yours. With that you might be able to enter the 10th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm. However, even though you will gain the strength to resist those kinds of experts, it is still far from enough to win against that woman!\u201d Su Meiyao said.Chen Xiang nodded his head in response and continued healing himself. The two beauties upon seeing that Chen Xiang did not have any serious problems let loose a deep breath before returning inside the ring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 Completion StageChen Xiang found one cave inside the cliff inside the Peris.h.i.+ng Dragon Mountains, in which he took the four True Elemental Dans, entered a cultivation state, and digested the vast True Qi brought by these four True Elemental Dans.At this time what he need to do was compress a large amount of True Qi into each of the divine beast forms, making the beast forms clearer! He had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins and the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] which could allow him to quickly refine the vast amount of True Qi, and at the same time could suck in the rich Spirit Qi around him!Chen Xiang was now not only cultivating True Qi but also at the same time using a large amount of True Qi to nourish the skeleton inside his body. A large amount of True Qi was integrating with his body, making his body grow!Four days past by, and the four colored mist shrouding Chen Xiang's body suddenly spread out, only to see a stream of bizarre and powerful qi flow suddenly surging out from the Chen Xiang's body.Chen Xiang was already successful in completing the four beast forms in the four corners, making the four True Qi beast forms clearly discernible, and lifelike!Unconsciously his consciousness entered the dantian within that Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram, like as if he was the one with the Yin and Yang diagram. At the moment it was as if he was sitting in the center of the Yin and Yang diagram, and he was at the center of the universe, and the four divine beasts were blazing suns hanging in four directions, looking magnificent and breathtaking.In the east was a dazzling azure light, the Azure Dragon was opening his mouth and waving its claws!In the south there was a giant, red bird, whose whole body was surging with fiery light, as if was burning with intense fire. It was the Vermillion Bird!In the west, s.h.i.+ning in a holy white light, was the furiously glaring majestic White Tiger!In the north was a mighty giant beast as if a giant dragon and a giant tortoise had fused together. It was the Black Tortoise!Yin and Yang represented the whole universe, and this world was guarded by the Divine Beasts of the Four Directions.The bodies of the four divine beasts were exuding vicissitudes of an ancient atmosphere, making people feel as if they were had existed since eternity, and Chen Xiang, who was in the center of the Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram, felt even smaller. However, he knew, he was the master of the Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram, and these four ancient divine beasts were created out from his cultivation.Chen Xiang only now knew that the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] after coordinating with his Yin and Yang Divine Vein was actually so powerful. He felt that he entered a martial arts road that was unusual, and if he could only release the complete power of these beast forms, he would be able to dominate the world!\"Only the great Earth Divine Elephant is left!\" Chen Xiang was also secretly shocked by the True Qi contained in the True Elemental Dan, and although it was only two grades higher than the True Qi Dan, there was a huge of difference.Chen Xiang took out all of his True Qi Dans, and as if he was eating a meal, he stuffed them inside his mouth, and fiercely chewed, while at the same time operating the divine exercises to refine them. Fortunately no one saw him wolfing down the True Qi Dans, otherwise they definitely would have wet their pants.Only Chen Xiang, this monstrous genius alchemist, would eat the True Qi Dan in such way, and yet was not even sad!Chen Xiang faintly felt that the beast form guarding the center was completely congealing its form. The amount of True Qi required was a lot more when compared with his other beast forms. He could see in the center of the Tai Chi diagram, the vague beast form was shrouded in a ball of golden mist, and was non-stop engulfing that mist..............Two days past, and a golden Qi burst out from Chen Xiang's body, followed by a gus.h.i.+ng of colorless True Qi which shattered his clothes, only to see his body constantly alternating between five different colors. His muscles also swelled up making him look very scary.His body color was changing faster and faster. Even from his pores a dark grey mucus was overflowing, and the muscles of his body were also stiff as stone.An explosive sound resounded in his mind, and at that moment, he just felt a tremendously huge strength surging into his limbs and bones, while in his mind the roars of the five divine beasts were resounding, their roars were very loud and powerful!Chen Xiang opened his eyes, took a deep breath, and his face was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with happiness, because he had finally entered the 10th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Completion Stage. The only thing left for him was to impact the True Martial Realm!Seeing the giant elephant above that Tai Chi Yin and Yang diagram in hs dantian, Chen Xiang slightly smiled as he had successfully congealed the five divine beast forms in his dantian. The minutiaes of their forms were clearly visible, and the Tai Chi diagram was slowly and quietly spinning, uptaking the Spirit Qi between heaven and earth.\"True Martial Realm, I also dare to fight with them!\" Chen Xiang tightly clenched his fists, his nails deeply entered in his palm. Previously he remembered the two vicious women, and he could not help but get angry.\"After you've entered the 10th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, although you indeed are very powerful but you are facing True Martial Realm experts so you still have no chance of winning. If you had a slightly powerful spirit weapon, perhaps you would successfully be able to sneak attack!\" Su Meiyao said, and she knew what intentions Chen Xiang had in his heart at this moment, but she also knew the difference between Chen Xiang and True Martial Realm martial artists.After entering the True Martial Realm, martial artists would be reborn, washed of the mortal Qi, and would have a lifespan of 1000 years. By no means would a Mortal Martial Realm martial artist be able to fight them.Chen Xiang nodded his head, took out black tights, wore them, and jumped down from the cave. He walked, according to map, towards the Heavenly Dragon Treasure.The map was very detailed, and Chen Xiang soon came to the location marked for the hidden treasure. It was a huge canyon, and at the entrance of the canyon there were thousands of people gathered. Among these people, a lot of people were holding a sheet in their hands which was the map, but Chen Xiang also wasn't clear why this map was spread.Mixed in the crowd, Chen Xiang was clearly able to see the giant canyon, and what made him shocked was that in the middle of canyon, to his surprise, a fiery red aura was flas.h.i.+ng. Occasionally a few red lightnings were also flas.h.i.+ng, and one after another, intensely hot and violent qi waves were gus.h.i.+ng out. At this time, Chen Xiang was sure of that the Heavenly Dragon Treasure was inside this Mysterious Realm, and that fiery red aura in the giant canyon was the entrance.Chen Xiang soon found out that a very strong barrier was before that entrance. In addition to this he also came to know that if anyone besides martial artists at the True Martial Realm tried approaching it, they would be rebounded by that power, and if they forcefully tried to enter it, they would be subjected to such a force that they would be squeezed into pieces of meat.After learning this information, in his heart, Chen Xiang was delighted. He quickly found one relatively high location, and carefully swept through the people towards the center to find that azure gown girl.That azure gown girl's strength was below the True Martial Realm, and her teacher was a True Martial Realm martial artist. That was why her teacher definitely would have entered the Mysterious Realm to seek treasures. This way, as long as he found that azure gown girl he would easily able to kill her!He didn't have to spend too long, Chen Xiang saw a dozen people sitting together far away, and some of those people were young. In addition to the azure gown girl there were some boys, and they were surrounding that azure gown girl like how the stars surrounded the moon.Chen Xiang from afar, could see that azure gown girl had a long face because her demon beast was killed by Chen Xiang, and she was powerless in killing Chen Xiang. This especially troubled her heart.The azure gown girl accidentally glanced towards the side of the crowd, but suddenly saw that deadpan handsome face of Chen Xiang. Looking at him she could not help but be surprised for a moment, and in her heart she was very pleasantly surprised. She certainly would not have thought of Chen Xiang having the strength to kill her, and she also knew although Chen Xiang was able to flee, he was also seriously injured.\"Senior brothers and junior brothers, that is the brat who killed my Little Black. Although he is somewhat powerful, but he was struck by my teachers palm so he is definitely seriously injured. You go and catch him, I want to hack him into pieces!\" The azure gown girl's face had a ruthless look while she spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
