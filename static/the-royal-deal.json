    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 A Life Without PurposeThe last thirty-six years of Heeyeon\u2019s life had not been particularly fortunate. She had lived with an indifferent husband and needlessly rude in-laws, and her parents nagged her endlessly as if she was their sounding board for all their complaints with life.There was also the matter of her colleagues who never missed an opportunity to stab her in the back. Her children felt like a burden, but she was too afraid to say it out loud for fear of censure. Nobody could really understand. Her husband might have as he should have, but he was too busy with his own affairs and expecting favor after favor from Heeyeon to pay attention to what a struggle motherhood was for her.Heeyeon was barely getting by in life, what with all these tangled, messy and complicated relationships surrounding her. Perhaps they were the reason she had picked up the habit of saying, \u201cI\u2019m sick of this,\u201d every now and then. She wondered when life had become so intolerably boring.Every day in her life seemed to drain the energy out of her like a parasite. Her life after marriage had become a nightmarish reality, one where she was failing an exam as there was no right answer to the problems. Her life repeated a mundane cycle of work and home and Heeyeon was rapidly nearing exhaustion.Today was another one of those days. She boarded the elevator holding a bag of compost with her gloved hand. A warm and dry breeze swept the hair off Heeyeon\u2019s eyes as she approached the steps leading outside her building. The breeze felt comforting and she looked up at the night sky almost subconsciously. Though the night was cloudless, not a single star could be seen. The waning crescent of the moon lit up the ground weakly, as did the streetlight. As she walked toward the dumpsters, she looked around her, noticing the cozily lit apartments and their warmly decorated balconies. The night was quiet except for the rustling of the young leaves that seemed to be enjoying the breeze as much as she was.Heeyeon let out a deep sigh. \u201cI wonder what is the purpose of my life,\u201d she said out loud to no one.Having disposed of the bag of compost, she took her time walking back to the apartment. She walked to her building and stopped right under her balcony and looked up. Her apartment seemed similarly cozy to the others, and yet Heeyeon felt a sense of dread looking at it. Instead of security, her home seemed to elicit a sense of imprisonment in her heart.Nevertheless, she soldiered on as there was an endless list of tasks still to be completed that evening. Heeyeon put her kids to bed, then made a weak attempt at cleaning the living room. She managed to do all the dishes and caught up with some menial tasks that her husband would never help with. Dedicated to finish her chores, she didn\u2019t realize when it was already past midnight. That was usually when her weeknights ended. Every night Heeyeon would pass out from fatigue and begin a new day with the same tasks and the same drudgery.Maybe it was her predictable future and the repeated nature of her chores that made way for her frustration, but that evening Heeyeon decided to make a stop at the bench near the entrance to the apartment. A cherry tree provided sweet escape from the blazing heat.\u2018I\u2019ll take just 5 minutes for myself.\u2019Being five minutes late should not flip her world upside down, and being five minutes early would not make her husband and kids more appreciative of her.Heeyeon sighed. It had been eleven years of being trapped in this cycle of work, parenting, and forced relationships.Her relationship with her husband had long since withered, and Heeyeon believed she did not know her husband any longer. It was like living with a stranger. She didn\u2019t know if all marriages turned similarly sour after a time, but social media stories seemed to tell a different story. The little bit of time she had for herself on the commute to and from work, Heeyeon spent it on her smartphone.\u201cI guess this means not every man in Korea is like that.\u201dThe relationship with her husband was one-sided, and he did not bother to show her any consideration just because she was his life. He seemed to want to stick around because of the convenience Heeyeon provided by being there and completing all his chores without complaint. This same dutifulness made her feel humiliated often. The rare moments of intimacy that came out of nowhere would end before Heeyeon could really acknowledge the excitement, and as always it was expected of her to make up for any shortcomings or unsatisfied desires. Disappointed by her marital life, she had stopped trying to open herself up with him.Couples who suffered from sexual incompatibility often cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for divorce. But Heeyeon\u2019s marriage was not failing just because of an unsatisfactory conjugal relationship alone. The simplest and most benign of arguments would make her think of divorce.On such days, she often recalled the words of a divorced friend, \u201cHeeyeon, you should never get divorced. From the divorce you see the lowest and worst side to that person\u2026it\u2019s something one should never willingly put oneself through\u201d.\u2018I want to just escape. Simply disappear one day.\u2019Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 Is This a Dream?She wasn\u2019t sure if she could go through the proceedings of a divorce.\u2018No. I have thought about it ten thousand times now, but from an outsider\u2019s point of view, I would appear ungrateful. We work as a family after all. I have food on the table and life is not that hard. That is probably the cause of such devious thoughts. If things were really hard, I wouldn\u2019t even have the time to consider a divorce.\u2019Though I do feel suffocated all the time.The only problem seemed to be her mindset really.\u2018If I can\u2019t get divorced then for this moment at the very least, I wish I could disappear. How I would love to turn back time. If I could do that, I would never marry!\u2019The thought of being in charge of the trajectory of her life brought a smile to Heeyeon\u2019s lips.\u2018I should go home. They must be waiting.\u2019Heeyeon quickly stood up from her seat, dusted herself, and started to walk back. She called the elevator which started to descend from the 10th floor.Level threeLevel twoLevel oneDing! The elevator ringed and opened up to a dark space inside. It was a common occurrence for one or two of the lights to go out from time to time. Since it was an old apartment complex, she did not think of it much and stepped inside. The moment the door closed, Heeyeon knew she had made a mistake. The elevator lurched and suddenly dropped. She collapsed with fear and a sinking feeling in her heart.\u201cHelp! Did the elevator drop? Is anybody there? Help!!\u201dShe yelled herself hoarse, believing her life was in danger. Nobody answered her calls, and her surroundings only became quieter. She couldn\u2019t even hear the echo of her voice now.\u2018I was definitely on level one. Is there a basement I never knew about? Even so, I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t be this deep!\u2019She mustered up the courage to look around, but it was so dark that she couldn\u2019t even see her body. Horror pulsated throughout her body like a current of electricity. She was covered in goosebumps and hot tears made their way down her cheeks. It was not just the darkness. Something was off, but she couldn\u2019t place her finger on it. She called for help again as the elevator continued to fall.After an indeterminable amount of time, she thought she could make out some faint light coming in from behind the doors. The light seemed to grow brighter and Heeyeon covered her eyes when it became painfully bright inside. A moment that had felt like forever had finally passed, and when Heeyeon opened her eyes again, she was not alone. It felt warm and almost cozy now.*A friendly voice almost sang to her.\u201cWake up, my lady. It\u2019s morning. Did you sleep well. The master and mistress await your presence downstairs for breakfast. We need to get you ready.\u201d\u2018My lady? Who is this? Where am I?\u2019She blinked away her confusion while staring at this rather friendly person who was calling out to her while referring to as \u2018my lady\u2019. Her attention was drawn away by the high ceilings decorated in gilded leaves and detailed floral patterns.Heeyeon realized she was in a bed, and was momentarily frozen in confusion and fear. When she gave no sign of moving, the calm and youthful voice repeated itself.\u201cHurry up, my lady. We need to go.\u201d\u2018My lady?\u2019Heeyon jumped out of the foreign bed and looked around in amazement. Her surroundings seemed reminiscent of the books she had read in school.\u2018It is like I have suddenly arrived in the worlds of Madame Bovary or Jane Eyre. Everything is so antique here.\u2019The bedroom was fitted luxuriously, and yet was designed almost to modern tastes. The woman who had been insisting she wake up was dressed just like the women in the period movies she saw on television. Heeyeon spotted a mirror with intricate leaf-like patterns on the borders and rushed to it. She jumped back on catching her reflection.She was not herself. Something was very wrong. All of a sudden, she had grown copper curls and her eyes had turned almost emerald. A button-like nose now occupied the center of her face and her lips seemed naturally peachy instead of their usual pale color. Nothing of her current appearance was like her original self.\u2018What had happened to her? What was going on? Is this a dream? This doesn\u2019t make sense. I must be dreaming.\u2019Heeyeon wanted to wake up. She slapped her cheeks, fully expecting to wake up in her cold and dreadful apartment building. Except, her slap left a stinging sensation, and she was still stuck in that foreign dream. She continued slapping herself.\u201cWake up, wake up, come on! Come to your senses. Wake up!\u201d\u201cMy lady? What\u2019s wrong? You are already awake.\u201d\u201cArghhh!\u201dHeeyeon was now frustrated with this dream. She was also almost frightened by this woman who had not disappeared after all. Her head hurt and she felt caught between incoherent memories.\u2018Am I in a dream right now? Was this what people meant when their dreams felt real?\u2019The other woman\u2019s kind hand on her shoulder felt too real for this to be a dream. All of it felt too real, and Heeyeon\u2019s thirty-six years of life felt like a dream instead. She cradled her aching head and mumbled helplessly.\u201cWhere am I?\u201dHeeyeon had whispered, but the woman seemed to have heard and replied swiftly.\u201cMy lady, what\u2019s wrong? You are Countess Lohikin. You behave so oddly today, I am confused. We must hurry and get you dressed. I would not like to see the Master scold you again.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cOh my! Have you forgotten me in a single night? I am Yellie! I attend to you every day. Do you feel ill? Do you have a fever?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 \u2013 First Mistake\u2018What happened to me? Where am I\u2019She was desperately trying to sort things out in her head and to get a grip on her emotions when a girl, \u2018Yellie\u2019, placed her hand on her bent head.Heeyeon looked up at her and saw genuine concern in her eyes. \u2018Count Lohikin? Yellie? Attend\u2026.to me?She couldn\u2019t make sense of what the woman was trying to tell her; she tried to recall the names of the characters in the novel that she had been reading. \u2018But there was nobody called Lohikin or Yellie.\u2019\u2018Is this not a novel? Then\u2026 where am I?\u2019Even as she frantically moved her head sideways to look at her surroundings, trying to figure out if they seemed even vaguely familiar, the maid Yellie, managed to steadily comb her tangled hair and tie them neatly with a navy-coloured ribbon.As she helped her into a light blue chiffon dress, it occurred to Heeyeon that Yellie must have prepared the clothes, the night before. The dress had an off-shoulder neckline, decorated with lace and looked beautiful.Yellie then escorted a bewildered Heeyeon out of the bedroom, into the hallway of the mansion. Her mistress looked lost\u2014Heeyeon was taken aback by the decor; she had never seen anything so exquisite before.Pieces of decorations that hinted at the mansion\u2019s antiquity. Adding to that, hallways were made more enchanting by evenly spaced out glass windows creating patterns on the carpet as the sun shined brightly through them.Outside the window, she saw spring in full bloom as the branches of large trees swayed lightly in the wind, in a neat and well-kept garden. Although she was witnessing this scene in front of her for the first time, she could have sworn that it felt familiar to her.Her head moved from one side to the other, taking in the details of her surroundings as she followed Yellie into the dining hall.Just as they were approaching the dining hall, Yellie mentioned that \u2018Young master Matin and Young Miss Merrild had had a fight this morning. So, the Countess is not in a good mood; best that you be careful today and do nothing to aggravate her temper.\u2019She nodded, suddenly feeling anxiety creep up her back.Upon entering the dining hall, she instantly recognized Count Lohikin, as the middle aged man and a lady seated next to him as the Countess; she looked younger than the him and had hair the same color she had seen, a few minutes ago on herself in the mirror.Next to the two, were a girl and a boy younger than herself, presumably Merrild and Matin, who awaited their turns to greet the Count and Countess with a kiss on the cheek.Both of them looked up at her arrival; Merrild smiled in greeting, genuinely happy to see her while Matin grinned mischievously, at her. At once, she could tell he was a naughty boy.\u2018Count Lohikin must have two daughters and one son; I must be the eldest.\u2019The Count called out to her as she stood at the door, staring blankly at them.\u201cIf you\u2019re here, come in and sit down. Are you going to keep standing there?\u201d The count\u2019s tone of voice was both gentle and firm.\u201cAh\u2026! Yes.\u201d She said, flustered.As she took a seat consciously, the maids standing by, came to life and started to serve delicious-looking food.\u201cAmethyst. I can\u2019t believe you overslept. You\u2019re already twenty years old\u2026 As a mother, I worry that you will continue doing so even when you are married.\u201d\u2018So, my name must be Amethyst. But if I am twenty now\u2026 Oh my god! I\u2019m sixteen years younger now?! Yaayy!\u2019She hadn\u2019t dared to ask Yellie her name and age; it would be even more suspicious since she kept saying Amethyst was being odd today\u2026\u00a0What a relief I found out naturally!\u201cYes ma\u2019am. I will be more careful in the future.\u201d She replied more cheerfully than she had intended.\u201cHmm? How unlike you, to use honorifics. Are you still mad about what happened yesterday?\u201d\u2018Oh no\u2026, mistake no. 1!\u2019Amethyst did some quick thinking to cover her slip and while speaking, prayed that she sounded authentic and believable.\u201cAh\u2026.! Not really\u2026.I mean I\u2019m older now\u2026..so I just thought I should be more careful with my words\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s when she decided to remain silent as much as possible. \u2018Remember, speak only when spoken to. No more than required.\u2019\u00a0She chanted in her head.Carefully lifting the spoon, she brought the clear creamy soup to her lips, hoping not to attract any more attention.The warm soup was delicious! It suddenly reminded her of how hungry she was, and she quickly spooned some more.\u201cTsk tsk. Since we are on the topic. You\u2019re already twenty years old and there\u2019s the thing we talked about the other day.\u201d Count Lohikin broke the silence and Heeyeon only looked at her with piqued interest. It\u2019s about time we start looking for your partner.\u201cI heard that the second son of Marquis Crenson\u2019s son recently finished his studies in the academy. I\u2019m not sure if you are aware but Marquis Crenson\u2019s son is skilled in his swordsmanship and has good looks as well. We have decided to set a date soon, you should know\u2026start getting ready..,\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d A horrified expression and the word had automatically burst out of her mouth, even before Count Lohikin could finish his sentence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 \u2013 A Land Called Sehar\u2018I know very well what it means by setting a date!\u2019Everyone was startled by her raised voice and stared at her in disapproval.\u2018Oh god\u2026 mistake number 2!\u2019To mend the current situation, she spoke gently and calmly with her head bowed as her face flamed red with embarrassment.\u201cWell. That is\u2026 I don\u2019t have any intention of getting married any time soon. No, to be exact I don\u2019t want to get married. So please pretend that the arrangement with the Marquis\u2026or his son never happened.\u201d\u201cAmethyst, what are you talking about! Just yesterday morning you were doing all sorts of\u2026ahem, things, asking us to set you up for marriage.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I thought about it again and I don\u2019t see the need anymore. So please, just pretend it never happened and reject the proposal. I beg of you.\u201d\u201cWhat? What sort of nonsense is this?!\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 I beg of you.\u201d She adopted a desperate and pitiful look which made Count Lohikin glare at her in disbelief.It was a look that she understood completely as an adult; he was taken aback by the change of attitude in his daughter within such a short time.Even so, he wanted to hold up his dignity and did not want to reprimand his daughter in front of the servants.\u201cAhem, let\u2019s finish our meal first.\u201dHe started to calmly eat his breakfast again, but Amethyst couldn\u2019t, she felt like her head was going to burst.\u2018I feel so sorry for the count but it\u2019s been barely an hour since I arrived in this world. And to think, marriage all of a sudden\u2026\u2019She shuddered from within.\u2018Of course, it isn\u2019t Count Lohikin\u2019s fault; how was he to know that I am sick of marriage after 11 years of it?\u2019\u2018My ecstasy at having escaped my miserable life has come to an abrupt halt when here, in this alternate world, I am met with the same fate.\u2019To Amethyst, the only viable alternative, just then, was running away. She excused herself saying she had a headache, quickly vacated her seat, and returned to her bedroom.After her departure, the countess remarked with concern.\u201cIt seems like her body condition is not too good lately.\u201d\u201cIt seems so. You should pay more attention.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dThe two continued their conversation and their meal; Merrild and Matin following their example, did the same.*[At the beginning of time, dark clouds covered the sky and settled down turning the whole world into darkness.Humans that had previously been mere insignificant creatures, started to conduct sacrificial rites. Soon a beautiful goddess with red eyes and sparkling platinum hair came down from the dark sky. She was known as Frosty, and as she took her first step on the earth, the black clouds that had enveloped the world in darkness disappeared forever, restoring glory.Greenery bloomed wherever she stepped and sooner, this land was called \u2018Sehar\u2019. From then on, the humans worshiped the goddess and learned reason, intelligence, and all the knowledge a human could learn.They established a kingdom by making descendants of a king, forming a nation. That was the beginning of the Sehar Kingdom. With the beginning of the kingdom, the goddess turned herself into a world tree and fell asleep in the kingdom of Sehar forever.]\u201cTurned herself into a world tree and fell asleep\u2026? Are they referring to an arboretum?\u201d Amethyst muttered to herself while holding a book titled \u2018History of the Sehar Kingdom\u2019.Fortunately for her, there were books in the Count\u2019s library to study the history of this place and she had decided to avail the opportunity.Nonetheless, she couldn\u2019t understand how she was able to read the words that looked like twisted black threads; so far she had found out that this was a world where magic existed and she was currently in the Sehar Kingdom.And based on the book , \u2018A noble lineage book every lady should read\u2019, she found out about the existence of a class of society headed by the king and his royal family, and a simple genealogy of the current noble families.Another rather unhelpful fact she had found out was that in Sehar, the best age for a girl to get married was immediately after 18.\u2018Great!\u2019\u00a0She had muttered to herself, bitterly.Despite being of marriageable age, the reason why Amethyst was still without a promising partner seemed mainly due to her looks, she thought.Amethyst was definitely not a beauty; she had double eyelids but they were faint. Her hazel-shaped eyes, round and stubby nose, thin lips, and severely tangled curly hair, would hardly make any man\u2019s heart flutter.Even when it was evaluated separately nothing seemed to stand out. Her only asset was her clear skin that had no freckles or pimples.\u201cTsk, wherever I go, people are after looks.\u201d She subconsciously clicked her tongue, grumbling to herself.\u2018I\u2019m not certain but if I am in a novel, it\u2019s not one I\u2019ve read before; it\u2019s not a name I remember. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of a place called the Sehar kingdom\u2026 and even if I was in a story, I\u2019m not the heroine, am I? Or maybe\u2026\u2019\u2018Have I moved into a different dimension and possessed another person to live their life? Although this reality seems less plausible\u2026\u2019She tried to collect her thoughts; she wasn\u2019t sure how she came to this place but she had to live the life of the twenty year old Amethyst instead of her thirty-six year old self, and she never knew when she might return to her original world so she should live as discreetly as possible.\u201cWill I\u2026be able to do it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 A Land Called Sehar (2)\u2018How am I supposed to accept this current situation? What am I to do?\u2019Her head was a whirlwind of chaos; thinking about her situation made her feel so confused and agitated, she was on the verge of bursting into sobs.\u2018I bet there\u2019s a big commotion there. It has been some time\u2026 I wonder how the kids are doing. I wonder if they are asleep? Are they be looking for me?\u2019Maybe not\u2026.\u2018My existence, after all, was irrelevant.\u2019\u2018Nobody had ever missed me\u2026 Not even my own family\u2019Her heart broke and a hammering headache took over her as these melancholy thoughts came to mind.\u2018I need to pull myself together. I need to focus on the now.\u00a0She scolded herself.\u00a0After all, this strange, new life in this unfamiliar land was all I have.\u2019The themes of the novels she had enjoyed reading often dealt with topics like possession, dimensional shifts and such; based on her knowledge of those, she felt confident that she could get by.Perhaps, if she dared to introspect, she might find that she could be\u2026 happy.\u2018I should be,\u2019 she firmly told herself. \u2018Not many people get to live new lives.\u2019Moreover, she was just twenty, she had her whole life ahead of her. She could do or be anything she liked.\u2018Maybe god really took pity on me and gave me a new opportunity. Yes, I need to think of it as a vacation. If this is a novel, I can use it as a means to start a fresh!\u2019\u2018I might not be the heroine of the story, but I will live an equally awesome life.\u2019\u2018It is a waste of time to try to figure out if this was a novel or a shift in dimensions. I will live in the moment and take things as they come.\u2019Filled with optimism and determination to make the best of the fate dealt to her, she could see the days ahead of her fill with excitement and adventure.\u2018What should I do first? I should adapt, as quickly as possible.\u2019Amazingly, she was able to read the words and speak this world\u2019s language, so the situation was under control.\u2018Under control\u2026\u2019 the phrase cheered her up immensely. She was in control of her fate. She would choose what would happen to her from now on. She had never been religious but right now, her joy at realizing the full potential of this extraordinary gift, made her want to thank any god.Strategizing, she decided her first and foremost task would be to adapt quickly to this situation. She would no longer dwell on why and how she got here.After all, thinking about it wasn\u2019t going to solve anything.\u2018I should probably talk to the Count in person.\u2019Yellie, who had been cautiously observing Amethyst as she stood by, interrupted her thoughts as she asked, \u00a0\u201cMiss, just yesterday, you caused such a ruckus saying you wanted to get married, but now you don\u2019t want to\u2026what made you change your mind? The master went through so much trouble to find a suitable match for you and yet\u2026perhaps do you not like the son of the Marquis of Crenson anymore?\u201dAmethyst, who had been resting on a luxurious couch placed in one corner of her bedroom, looked at her.\u2018Since I\u2019ve decided to make an effort and fit in, I should establish a rapport with the maid who attends to me.\u2019\u201cI have no reason to like or dislike someone who I\u2019ve never met before.\u201d\u201cThen, is there anyone else you like? Considering your\u2026age?\u201d Yellie abruptly cut off her sentence, realizing she had blurted out her innermost thoughts.Sensing her delicate mention of age, it occurred to Amethyst that a 20-year-old woman, in this land called Sehar, is probably regarded as an old virgin, one that is nearing to be on the shelf.She sighed.\u2018Imagine the irony, when to me twenty feels like the prime of life!\u2019However, to Yellie, Amethyst replied with a deliberate carelessness, as if she were unperturbed by any of society\u2019s conventions.\u201cYellie, yesterday I had a\u2026 dream. It was an awfully scary dream.\u201d\u201cA dream?\u201d\u201cYes. It felt more like a premonition. Or maybe it was a nightmare\u2026.it was so traumatic\u2026I can\u2019t tell you. However, that dream had cemented my resolve. I do not intend to get married any time soon. I hope you won\u2019t mention marriage in front of me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 a dream is just a dream. What kind of dream did you have?\u201dFor a moment, I wonder if she would believe me if I told her the truth.\u2018That I was a thirty-six-year old woman married for eleven years.\u2019But she probably will brush it aside saying it was too absurd even for a dream. \u201cWell\u2026in any case, don\u2019t even mention the word in front of me.\u201dMaking it clear that she no longer wanted the conversation to continue, Amethyst closed her eyes and went back to her thoughts.\u2018I wonder which one is the dream?\u2019\u2018The life of the thirty-six years old Heeyeon? Or the twenty years old\u00a0Amethyst? Was one of them dreaming of the other?\u2019\u2018If this world was the real one and I really am\u00a0Amethyst, then first and foremost, I need to resolve the issue of my impending marriage.\u2019Leaving Amethyst to her thoughts, Yellie quietly left the room.Just as she had closed the door, Countess Lohikin, who had been wandering in the corridor in front of the room, hurriedly beckoned Yellie.\u201cYellie, did you manage to ask her? Why is Amethyst suddenly acting that way? I\u2019m sure you remember just yesterday\u2026\u201dYellie waited patiently for the Countess to finish speaking and she replied hesitantly. \u201cWell\u2026 Madam, she said she had a nightmare. And I think she thinks of it as a premonition.\u201d\u201cA dream\u2026?! A premonition? That\u2019s it? So, did she share the contents of her dream?\u201d\u201cNo Madam, the lady didn\u2019t share any more details.\u201dSensing that the countess longed to press her for more details, Yellie excused herself saying that she knew nothing more and had something to discuss with the kitchen staff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 A Doting Father (1)That night, Amethyst was requested by Count Lohikin for a private audience. And it was not long \u2018till she found herself knocking at his door.\u201cCome in.\u201dAs she entered she looked at the room, smell of old wood, smoke, and a faint floral scent from the flowers that emanated from the vase on the table wafted up her nostrils. She took a seat at the plush chair in front of his desk, across from him.He was her father, but she had no idea what to expect from him, which made her nervous. Her own father, the one she knew, had never been affectionate. Grim and cold, he was the typical patriarchal figure, deep-rooted in his opinions, refusing to tolerate anything other than what they believe to be right.\u2018I won\u2019t be surprised if the Count is exactly like that. I really expect no miracles from men.\u2019\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dCount Lohikin simply looked at his daughter who appeared far from her usual self.Somehow, she could feel the warmth in his gaze and felt herself subconsciously relaxing. \u2018So he did care for\u00a0Amethyst.\u2019\u201cFather, like I said this morning, I have no desire to marry. I\u2019d like to be clear on that matter. I hope you will decline the marriage proposal to marry into the family of the Marquis of Crenson.\u201dCount Lohikin\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise but he otherwise remained calm. She couldn\u2019t tell if he were displeased with her resistance or impressed.\u201cBut this is completely different from what you said yesterday. Do you realise that?\u201d\u2018Oh god. Right, yesterday\u2026 Just what had\u00a0Amethyst\u00a0done the day before?\u2019\u2018But hold on, there was no need for me to forcefully bring up something I don\u2019t know anything about. I can just bypass that!\u2019\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure this puts father in a difficult position. But I am most certain that I want to decline this marriage.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Count Lohikin silently stroked his beard, apparently deep in thought.\u201cActually\u2026I understand to some extent why you caused a scene. I\u2019m sure you felt impatient after hearing the news of your friend Marai\u2019s engagement.\u201d\u2018Marai? Who is that? Anyway, I really don\u2019t care at all whether she gets married or not, as long as it isn\u2019t me.\u2019Please God, don\u2019t let it be me.\u201cHonestly, I felt a little upset when you caused a scene\u2026\u201d Count Lohikin couldn\u2019t stop the chuckle that escaped his lips as he recalled his precious daughter\u2019s stunt just the day before. \u201cPerhaps this is for the better. If that is how you feel, then so be it. I only expect one thing. That is your happiness.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dAmethyst was speechless with delight.\u2018Hallelujah!\u2019He was an ideal father, the kind that often appeared in morning dramas as the heroine\u2019s father, always considerate of his daughter\u2019s wishes.\u2018Well, well, well\u2026Who knew fathers like that could exist? Now, I have one like that of my own!\u2019She was convinced this new life of hers was a gift from God, a compensation for all the miseries she had faced in her past life.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll talk to Marquis Crenson.\u201d\u201cThank you, father.\u201d Amethyst grinned at him in gratitude. However, to her surprise, the count started to frown. Did her reaction somehow made Lohikin upset?\u201cThey say when daughters grow up, they don\u2019t like to associate with their fathers as much, so I guess that\u2019s what we are going through now. My little girl seems to be keeping her distance from me more and more\u2026\u201d Count Lohikin said forlornly, looking at his eldest child with affection.\u2018Ah, they must have gotten along well. I\u2019m not surprised.\u2019\u201cNo. That\u2019s not true.\u201d\u201cEven this morning you forgot your morning greeting\u2026and you don\u2019t smile much these days\u2026\u201d\u2018Morning greeting? Oh\u2026Was he referring to the kiss on the cheek I saw Merrild and Matin do, this morning? Oh my. Their relationship must have been more than just good. She was definitely on better terms with her father than I had expected.\u2019To think that this cool-headed middle-aged man was in low spirits because of his daughter\u2019s lack of greeting. Amethyst felt a pang of guilt for causing that.\u201cI\u2019ll try not to forget it tomorrow.\u201dLooking at Amethyst\u2019s smile, the count looked convinced, \u201cAlright. Is there anything else you want to say?\u201d\u201cAh! I have a favour to ask you, father.\u201d\u201cA favour?\u201d\u201cYes. I was wondering if I could get a tutor.\u201d\u201cA tutor?\u201d\u201cYes. Can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cWell it\u2019s not difficult to get you one, but you\u2019ve already graduated from the academy.\u201d\u2018Oops. Mistake no. 3\u2019\u2018Does that mean I\u2019ve already graduated from school? But I still have so much I need to learn about this world. If I keep asking Yellie she\u2019s going to think I\u2019ve gone mad.\u2019\u201cWell\u2026I want to learn things I didn\u2019t learn while I was at the academy.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201dWherever you go, what you learn in school is about the same. I\u2019m sure the same applies to this world; I must have studied only academic subjects.After all, in my past life, schools didn\u2019t teach me about how to survive when one steps put of society.\u201c\u2026I want to learn more about the world.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d A bolstering laughter filled the room.\u201d Really, you are still an oddball!\u201d\u2018W\u2026Was I?\u2019As Count Lohikin laughed out loudly, Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but laugh along.\u201cAlright. I will look into it. Will a cultural tutor do?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Is there anything else you need?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cAlright. I will be up a little longer as I have things I need to finish some official documents. You go ahead and go to bed.\u201d\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d\u201cAlright. Good night.\u201dAs she turned to leave, Count Lohikin coughed, looking at Amethyst expectantly.\u201cAhem, ahem.\u201d\u2018Hmm, what was this? What\u2019s with those expectant eyes? Could it be\u2026?\u2018Ah\u2019.\u00a0Amethyst smiled as she stood up from her seat and carefully pecked Count Lohikin\u2019s cheek.\u201cGood night.\u201dFor Amethyst it felt awkward but the Count seemed satisfied and happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 \u2013 A Doting Father (2)The next day with Yellie\u2019s help, Amethyst was able to reach the dining room on time. As usual, the Lohikin couple was already there and waiting.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d She answered with a smile.She had already sat down in her chair, when recalling yesterday\u2019s conversation with the Count, she stood up and approached the couple, awkwardly kissing each of them on the cheek and sat back down in her chair.\u2018Wow, I can feel my two cheeks burning up.\u2019Next, Matin ran into the dining room, kissed the both of them and quickly rushed to his seat.\u201cMatin, what did I say about running in the dining room?\u201d The Countess gently reprimanded Matin and turned to the Count. \u201cDarling, you should tell him off firmly sometimes.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me anymore.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do that.\u201dCount Lohikin and Matin both exchanged a look and shrugged their shoulders.Merrild was the last to be seated, and breakfast began; today, there was a fresh salad topped with roasted meat, clear soup and soft bread.While eating the meat from her salad, Amethyst listened in on the conversation between the Count and the Countess.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were going to work today for the loan approval case?\u201dWork? Interested, Amethyst discreetly gave rapt attention to the information being exchanged in the table.\u201cOh, right. Yes. I will go in the morning.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of work just hire more people.\u201d\u201cEven so, the loan approval case is up to me since I am the final approver.\u201d\u201cHmm, I suppose you are right.\u201d\u201cFortunately, there isn\u2019t much this week. It\u2019s just difficult to review that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cIf you are tired, I can help you a little\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. You\u2019re busy as it is. Even after leaving the palace you still have a stack load of work to catch up on in your office.\u201d\u201cWell that\u2019s true but\u2026\u201d\u2018This must be a dual-income household, I gather.\u2019\u2018Since Countess Lohikin mentioned that she is the final approver, she must be someone of oimportant role. Speaking of loans, maybe\u2026she is the head of a bank?\u2019Last night, Count Lohikin mentioned official documents and now they\u2019re referring to the palace as his place of work. So, he must be working for the nation, and her mother seemed to own a bank.It was no doubt that Amethyst was born with a silver spoon.In the time that Amethyst had been here, the count and countess seemed to be an ideal couple, affectionate and respectful towards each other and to their children. Even after years of marriage, the count paid his wife the attention she deserved.This made Amethyst mull about her marriage in her past life\u2026 Suddenly, she heard her husband\u2019s voice once again.\u2018What difference does it make, whether you know or not?\u2019\u2018Just give it to me when I ask for it. Why are you being so nosy and trying to know everything?\u2019\u2018You should be able to deal with things on your own. Do I have to tell you everything?\u2019\u2026those condescending and dismissive tones, how her opinion never seemed to matter at all, she shuddered at the reminder.The Lohikin\u2019s marriage was the exact opposite of hers; full of genuine respect and affection for each other. This was advantageous from Amethyst\u2019 perspectives. Belonging to a privileged family of high social standing, no man would be able to disrespect or ill-treat her.\u2018The real twenty-year old Amethyst would never even realize what a boon that is!\u2019*A few days later, Amethyst was able to meet the tutor and liberal arts teacher she had requested of her father.He was young and slim, looking more like a good-looking engineering university student, than a liberal arts tutor.\u201cHello, Miss Lohikin. I am Froy.\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to meet you.\u201dAmethyst still struggled to adopt her new identity at times; since she was unable to introduce herself as Heeyeon, the way she used to, she skipped the introduction altogether.Even though this was rude behaviour, Froy didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201cI heard from the Count that you wanted to learn more about the world?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFroy\u2019s eyes gleamed with interest as he considered her. \u201cYou truly are different from the other ladies.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. It is not a common thought amongst young noble ladies.\u201d\u201cI have a very curious personality.\u201d\u201cI see. So, what are you curious about the world? I will do my best to teach you everything I know.\u201d\u2018Phew. What a relief he is not the prying sort!\u2019\u201cI\u2019d like to know more about the empire.\u201d\u201cThe empire\u2026 I\u2019m sure you already know about its history, but I suppose we should start there. The Sehar Empire is a nation formed under the blessing of the Goddess Frostin. The goddess shined a light on the world which was full of darkness\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, not that kind of vain history.\u201dThis remark of hers elicited an extraordinary response from him; his eyes widened as he burst out laughing, clearly surprised and amused. After what seemed like eternity to Amethyst, his laughter subsided and he spoke, wiping a tear from his eye.\u201cOh, dear God. Vain? Please don\u2019t say something like that elsewhere. You will be arrested for insulting divinity.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s face flushed red with embarrassment. \u201cNoted.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then besides its vain history what else are you curious about in the empire?\u201dAmethystdecided to cut beating around the bush and blurted out, \u201cIn the empire is it a must to get married?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 The Bloody Duke (1)Although his eyebrows shot up in surprise, he answered calmly. \u201cYou do understand that it is a very odd question to ask?\u201dAmethyst nodded. Froy may think it a frivolous question, but to her, it was of utmost importance; her life and future depended on his answer.\u201cNormally when women turn eighteen, they celebrate a coming-of-age ceremony and decide on their partnerships. However, within the empire, marriage is a free choice. There is no law mandating you to get married.\u201dShe felt the heavy burden of her impending doom slowly lift off her heart. However, there was another thing she needed clarified.\u201cThen\u2026in the empire, how are women ranked?\u201dObserving the Lohikin couple, she had hypothesized that men and women had equal rights, but she couldn\u2019t be sure if this applied only to the Lohikin household.Based on the books she had read before from world history, literature, novels, the women had always fewer rights as compared to men. This world seemed to be a mix of the modern and medieval and if it wasn\u2019t anything different from the world she knew, she imagined she was bound to be restricted.To her it was imperative that she have as much information as she possibly could to differentiate the things she could and should not do and act accordingly.\u201cHmm\u2026that\u2019s too broad. Do you have an example?\u201d\u2018Oh. The answer must be very complicated.\u2019Amethyst thought hard about what to say next; how to adequately articulate what she wanted to know from Froy.The life of a woman, as she was familiar with, was meant to live as someone else\u2019s slave.The world may be changing rapidly and granting women their dues, but the majority of women like her, who were neither assertive nor talented with nothing to call their own, implicitly belonged to their father if they were not married, then to their husband when they were, and to their children, once they became parents; not realizing what they want and living a life of silent submission.Exactly like me.\u201cAre women allowed to travel alone, or\u2026go overseas for higher studies, or open their own businesses, or are they restricted in their workplace? How do men react to women?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026are asking really odd questions, are you aware?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe was well-aware of just how absurd these questions might sound to him, but the answers to these were absolutely vital to her.\u2018Since my youth, I have lived my whole life on terms dictated by my father until I was married; I wasn\u2019t able to freely go on a graduation trip with my friends because he didn\u2019t allow it. If I ever didn\u2019t abide by the curfew set by him, the rage of a fiery dragon was unleashed in the house.\u2019\u2018Nothing changed even after I got married. The role simply was passed on from my father to my husband; it was his approval I sought to meet friends, or even to visit my own parents.\u2019\u2018It was never \u201cI\u2019m going to my parents\u201d but always \u201cCan I go visit my parents?\u201d\u2019\u2018Looking back now, I wonder why it was that way.\u2019And the moment she became a mother, her children became the centre of her universe, she pushed her wants and needs aside to cater to them, willingly accepting this fate.\u2018When did I ever live for myself?\u2019She was lost in the thoughts of her past life, a tear on the verge of dropping onto her cheek, when Froy\u2019s voice broke her reverie.\u201cThe Sehar empire is under the law of the Emperor. And anyone, regardless of their status or rank is able to get a job, start their own business and travel overseas to study or for leisure. But of course, there are exceptions.\u201d\u201cExceptions?\u201dAmethyst\u2019s body tensed up at the mention of an exception.\u2018Was he perhaps referring to a married woman?\u2019\u201cExcept slaves. But since your lady is not a slave, you are free to do whatever you wish.\u201d\u2018In my world, married woman and slaves were synonyms. I hope that\u2019s not the case here\u2026\u2019\u201cOh! Slaves?\u201d\u201cYes. Slaves are those who are owned by others. As such, without their owner\u2019s approval they are not allowed to travel or have their own job or start a business. Hmm, but slavery has been abolished, so now the only remaining are the government official slaves.\u201d\u2018Thank god!\u2019\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cEven though they are slaves and are not allowed complete freedom, they are not treated poorly. They are paid for their fair labor. If they want to go for a holiday, they only need to ask their owners.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026I see.\u201dIs this what they call modern slavery? Well, that was exactly what my life was like not too long ago.Maybe because their belief was in a goddess or because their ruler was a female, at least they didn\u2019t seem to treat women poorly here. To be more accurate, it seemed that this place was neither a patriarchal society nor a matriarchal society.\u201cI want to know more in detail about the empire\u2019s royal and noble families.\u201d\u201cThe current empire is ruled by her Majesty Belice. Below are two royal families, one of which is the Duke of Skad, the only kinship of the present Emperor.\u201dT/N: The emperor here is a female.The Sehar Empire has a hierarchy of social standing, ranking from the emperor, the two royal families, aristocrats, wizards, knights, commoners, free people, down to the slaves.The Skads and Rodens were long-established families that supplemented the emperor ever since the Sehar Empire\u2019s beginning. Among them, the Skad family was the most prestigious family that was most similar in power and authority to the emperor. In fact, the 23rd Duke of Skad was the only blood relative and the younger brother of the reigning emperor\u2014his name was Alexcent Frostin du Skad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 The Bloody Duke (2)In the Sehar Empire, by the blessing of the goddess, a princess would always be born as an only daughter once every few decades. This princess would then be crowned. As such, there were no blood baths for succession, the country was stable and hence, had potential to develop into a great empire, achieving a peaceful era even until today.On rare occasions, after a female heir to the throne was born, a male would be born but as soon as the princess was crowned the emperor, he would depart from the palace. And while being treated as an imperial family member, he would stay in a position that served to aid the emperor.Even such cases were rare so there were very few people with platinum hair and red eyes which was the traits of the royal family.The previous Emperor was the only one in history, since the founding of the Sehar empire, to give birth to fraternal twins.Belice became the current emperor and ruled the empire at the age of twenty-one. As for the Prince Alexcent, he took over the title of the 22nd Duke of and later on, became the 23rd Duke\u00a0and\u00a0Prince of Skad.Empress Belice had a bigger dilemma than her government affairs. Her one and only younger brother was now being referred to as the \u201cblood duke.\u201d He seemed to have no plans of getting married and was absorbed only in his work.The duke was famously known not only within the empire but even in other nations, as a work addict. If one of the two families that support the Sehar Empire collapsed or the successor disappeared, it wasn\u2019t just the emperor that was in danger. The entire Sehar Empire could be shaken up.In a way the duke\u2019s marriage was more important than the emperor\u2019s.*Empress Belice, who had been signing the documents piled up in the office, asked Karune, her first secretary standing in front of her.\u201cHmm\u2026any news from that side?\u201d\u201cNo, your majesty. As you know he is rather stubborn. If he was one to follow orders, he would never have caused us this predicament in the first place.\u201dBelice frowned as she passed the approved document to Karune.\u201cI wonder if he has any sense in that wooden head of his. I guess this means I have to step in.\u201d Belice\u2019s forehead creased, thinking of ways to make her insolent brother bend to her will, \u201cFine I will invite all the young ladies of the noble families to this year\u2019s commemoration party for the completion of the Belicean Palace. Of course, internally, it will be the search for the duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I accept your command.\u201dThe Belicean Palace was a separate palace built to commemorate Belice\u2019s ascension as the empress. It was built over a period of over eight years and was nearing its completion. It was also the place where Belice and her fianc\u00e9, Duke of Roden, would celebrate their coming union.Karune quietly exited the office, holding a freshly signed copy of the payment document signed by the Empress.Her Highness seemed perturbed, probably because of the duke\u2019s delayed marriage; well, it was a legitimate cause for concern.After Karune left, Belice, now alone, rubbed her tired eyes and muttered to herself. \u201cI swear I\u2019ve aged ten years because of you, Alexcent. I won\u2019t be surprised to find grey hair next.\u201d*Gen, the assistant to the Duke of Skad stood erect in attention in front of him, holding files full of documents. Despite it being late in the night, the duke\u2019s study was warm from the ember flames still ablaze in the fireplace.Alexcent scanned the paperworks with his reddish black eyes set in a perfectly featured face, with his short platinum hair ruffled and unkempt.Despite the luxurious warmth in the place, Gen felt like he was standing in the middle of a frozen road. Cautiously, he opened his mouth to speak.\u201cThe palace has sent an urgent message.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure it\u2019s regarding the same topic.\u201d\u201cYes. That is correct. Would you like to reply?\u201d\u201cGive it to me.\u201dOn the document Gen presented, was the stamp of the world tree, the emblem of the empress.The duke snatched it from Gen\u2019s hand\u2019s and without a moment\u2019s hesitation, tossed it into the blazing flames of the fireplace. Accompanied by the crackling sounds, the Emperor\u2019s letter fluttered into flames and were soon turned into ashes.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Aghast, Gen spoke before he could control himself.The duke looked up with an eyebrow raised, as if to remind him not to cross the line and continued to read his documents as usual.\u201cI will handle the reply on my own. Isn\u2019t it about time to give up? How persistent she is! I wonder what Duke Roden sees in this stubborn person.\u201d\u201cYour Highness. Even if you are siblings, she is the Empress. Such words are a display of disloyalty.\u201d While Gen reprimanded him, the Duke of Skad merely shrugged his shoulders, probably not even listening to him.His devil-may-care ways frustrated him. While fulfilling a part of his responsibilities, Alexcent completely ignored other more important ones.Feeling uneasy, as this was already the 58thletter from her sister, Gen decided then that he must do something about it; he couldn\u2019t avoid the empress\u2019s orders much longer and he would rather trick the duke into marriage than face Belice\u2019s wrath.As he paused from his paperwork to think of a solution, Gen suggested an idea, testing him.\u201cIf it\u2019s a marriage you dislike, why don\u2019t you have a contract marriage?\u201d\u201cA contract?\u201d\u201cYes, and just see through with the marriage. Put out the urgent fire first before\u2026\u201dEven before Gen could finish his sentence the duke spoke. \u201cFind one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Contract Marriage\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cFind me someone, to have a contract marriage with.\u201dIncredulous, Gen asked., \u201cAre you serious about this?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who brought up this idea? Hence, go and find someone\u201d\u201cBut\u2026Yes, I understand.\u201dThe duke\u2019s orders were always short and precise. Never to be disobeyed.Gen had suggested it as a joke, but now felt obliged as the duke had taken him seriously. He wondered if he would be able to find a woman who would want to marry the bloody duke or the monstrous prince of blood.Where could he find a partner for him?He was the duke of the nation and the one and only brother to the emp. His partner, even if she wasn\u2019t a member of the royal family, had to at least be someone from a noble ranked family.Furthermore, a marriage based on a contract?It was impossible to find the daughter of a noble family who would agree to this when she could be abandoned at any point in time. But it was too late to take back his words.Gen regretted his frankness and blamed himself. Yet, the only way to save his life would be to look for a promising lady. Swearing to himself never to speak his thoughts out loud, he exited the study.Once Gen exited the room the duke got out of his chair and walked over to look out at the scenery from the glass window.\u201cA contract marriage\u2026that doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but smile. As long as it succeeds, he would be able to avoid Belice\u2019s nagging for a while.*A forlorn Gen entered the imperial palace with a reply to exactly the 58th letter. He was walking down the long corridor towards the empress\u2019s study when he heard voices from afar so stopped to listen.\u201cCount Lohikin, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI am very sorry Marquis Crenson. I am not sure how to express this myself. My daughter suddenly says she doesn\u2019t want to ever get married.\u201d\u201cWas my son not to her liking?\u201d\u201cNo! Of course not. Please don\u2019t take this the wrong way. How could she dislike your son whom she\u2019s never met. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want to marry your son but says she hates marriage all together. Which also puts me in a very compromising position.\u201d\u201cHa-ha, well. If that is how the young lady feels then I\u2019m sure you must be frustrated. Isn\u2019t she already twenty this year?\u201d\u201cWell what\u2019s the point of me stressing over it? It\u2019s not like I could tie her up and force her into one. I am gravely worried that she would change her mind tomorrow and ask for a marriage partner.\u201d\u201cWell then, I suppose we should consider this engagement never happened. It is a pity. I truly wanted to form family ties with you, Count Lohikin.\u201d\u201cLikewise. I regret this missed relationship with you Marquis Crenson. However, thank you for understanding.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure we can always create other relationships in the future? I hear you have another daughter?\u201d\u201cYes! That is right. Oh my, shall we carry on our conversation some place else?\u201cYes.\u201dAs their conversation became longer, Count Lohikin and Marquis Crenson paused to walk far away from the corridor.A young lady that dislikes marriage\u2026 How surprising that someone else shares the same thought as his highness. Count Lohikin must be going through quite the trouble.Gen resumed walking as the head of the two families voices faded away then came to a sudden halt.Wait\u2026.! Why hadn\u2019t I thought of this before? If two people who dislike marriage come together based on their own needs and form a contract to fool the eyes of others\u2026He quietly drew the cross across his chest.\u201cOh! God! Thank you.\u201dThen with a soft smile he watched the two until they disappeared. Things were going too well, he couldn\u2019t help but feel happy.The daughter of Count Lohikin\u2026I must look into her immediately. Ahhh! Before that I must see Her Majesty first.Meeting the empress placed tremendous pressure on him. Before he knew it, he was standing outside the door of her study. Gen took a deep breath and lightly knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cI pray for the glory of the Sehar empire and the blessing of the goddess to the Empress Belice. I am Gerald Artin, the first assistant of the Skad household offering you my gre-\u201d\u201cYou can skip the greetings. Gen, I guess you brought me the usual reply.\u201d\u201cMy sincere apologies to Your Highness.\u201d Gen bowed deeply and apologised to Belice.\u201cWhy should you be sorry. So, has Alexcent\u2019s leg fully healed?\u201d\u201cSorry? His Highness was never injured.\u201d He had seen the duke just this morning and he had been perfectly fine. It couldn\u2019t be that something had happened on his way here.\u201cOh. I thought he broke his leg since he hasn\u2019t shown up for some time.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2026\u201d Drops of sweat started to form on his forehead. He opened and closed his mouth then decided to shut it all together.Belice\u2019s scarlet eyes shone beneath her elaborately and intricately braided platinum hair. The same sharp eyes as the duke, a beautiful and cold smile adorning her lips. But unlike her mouth, her eyes were not smiling.Just being in the same space with someone whose expression he couldn\u2019t read made Gen feel strangled and pressured. It was indeed the charisma and dignity of an empire\u2019s ruler, which must be why the duke was avoiding her as much as possible.The empress tapped on the letter placed on her table and continued. \u201cForget it, just tell him to make sure he attends the commemoration party for the Belicean palace. If he doesn\u2019t I will really break his leg.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dWith a short sigh, Gen left the empress\u2019 study. Then he went on to immediately investigate on the daughter of Count Lohikin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Magical (1)\u201cAmethyst Lohikin?\u201dThe duke asked surprised, to which Gen replied immediately. \u201cCount Lohikin\u2019s eldest daughter is now in her twenties. The two of you have quite the age gap of 8 years but since it\u2019s a contract marriage I doubt it will be an issue.\u201d\u201cNo, tell me why she\u2019s the right one.\u201dHe sensed the annoyance in the duke\u2019s voice and realised he was missing out the main point.\u201cAh! I hear that the lady is \u2018refusing marriage\u2019 itself. But the lady is twenty years old this year. She is nearing the end of her marriage eligible age so I\u2019m sure Count Lohikin is worried. Don\u2019t you think this is very similar to someone else?\u201d\u201cMe? So how does that make her the right one.\u201dGen carefully studied the duke\u2019s reaction and smiled.If the duke himself didn\u2019t want to get married and was willing to take part in a contract marriage to fool the eyes of others, then she would also feel the same.There was no better contract than this.Grasping Gen\u2019s intention, the duke asked the next question.\u201cSo how is it? For her?\u201d\u201cOh that\u2026 I think it might be best if you meet her yourself during the commemoration party for the Belicean palace. The empress has kindly invited all young noble ladies to the party. I am sure she will be there too.\u201d\u201cHmm, a party with all ladies.\u201d After a moment\u2019s delay, he finally said, \u201cI will attend.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Gen sighed in relief as the duke agreed to go but couldn\u2019t help but feel suspicious of his lack of resistance.\u201cYes. It\u2019s obviously Belice\u2019s plan. She wants to identify a potential partner for my marriage. So, no matter what, I\u2019ll have to go,\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201dGen sighed again in relief.Disregarding the intentions, things were going according to plan; he relaxed a bit, satisfied with his accomplishments and was praising himself internally, when the duke spoke smugly.\u201cI bet my sister Belice threatened you about this.\u201d\u201cWhat? She did not.\u201d Duke Skad scoffed and continued, \u201cI know the Belice let you come back in one piece, even after the 58th reply. It is as likely as the sun rising from the west.\u201dGen heard the skepticism in the duke\u2019s words and wondered how the two siblings were so alike in their terrible thoughts. Perhaps it was because they were twins.*Amethyst wasn\u2019t sure if this was a fairytale. She could only conclude that it was a different world. She was 16 years younger in this world, and her real body had been left behind in a different dimension.God must have taken pity on me and given me this new opportunity.Amethyst mocked her situation, trying to find the humor with this incomprehensible turn of events.\u2018I don\u2019t know what has happened to the real Amethyst Lohikin or when she is coming back. I really don\u2019t care right now. I have an opportunity to live for myself here, and not live for others. It may be selfish but I am exhausted of my life as an unappreciated mother and wife. I can just pretend I am on vacation in a foreign land and simply enjoy the new experiences.\u2019Amethyst felt sorry for Count Lohikin but had firmly rejected the idea of getting married. The only thing left to do was to adapt to this new world. It would be nice to live as a daughter of a Count. Life of a noble\u2019s daughter must certainly be one of comfort.The daily chores of her previous life had been endless: her constantly hungry family, the piling dishes, the daily laundry, and a messy home. The children who would fight all the time or whine for anything and everything.\u2018It should be okay to escape for a while.\u2019Her new life was like a beautiful dream. Amethyst couldn\u2019t remember the last time she did anything leisurely for herself. In this new land, however, all she had done so far was relax, eat and sleep. What a vacation after 11 years of struggle.She couldn\u2019t set aside the nagging anxiety of being forced into a marriage by the Lohikins though. Her current self was not a ravishing beauty by any means. It would be best if maintained a low profile.She wished she could do whatever she wanted but this seemed to be a conservative society, albeit a comfortable one. Fortunately for Amethyst, her new parents were wealthy and her new brother Matin was their heir. Their attention was not on her.She wanted to go out and explore however.The Count\u2019s house was great but there were too many who knew this Amethyst well.Any action could garner suspicion, and she always had to be on her toes in case her identity roused any suspicion. The servants were probably just doing their job, but Amethyst did not know if they had been placed there to spy on her.\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll do everything I want to do in the Count\u2019s house.\u201d\u2018I will learn swordsmanship, then learn to ride a horse and to hunt. I should at least be able to protect myself.\u2019And then the thing she most wanted to do was to travel. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of my time to stay in the Count\u2019s house when there is this this amazing world out there to explore!\u201d\u2018Perhaps I could use studying as an excuse to travel.\u2019\u2018It would be great to learn magic too\u2026or maybe that\u2019s too complicated for me. I guess you need to have talent for that. Well you never know what hidden talents I have. I have lived a repressed life for too long.\u2019Amethyst was considering the different possibilities when Yellie opened the door and interrupted her thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 Magical (2)\u201cMy Lady, how can you be laze away today as well? The master has already said that there is a party at the imperial palace tomorrow. They have invited all young ladies so you must attend as well. Which means you should get your dress and choose your heels and accessory, so how could you be laze around like that.\u201d\u201cI can just wear any dress. Nobody will pay any attention to me anyway. I don\u2019t need to stand out.\u201d Then suddenly a thought crossed Amethyst\u2019s mind and her expression brightened. \u201cYellie, there will be other young noblemen \u2013 counts and knights \u2013 there, right?\u201d\u201cKnights? Of course. Is the guy you like perhaps a knight?\u201d\u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m wondering if I can convince someone to teach me swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cWhy would you need to learn swordsmanship? You must have a knight you like?\u201d\u201cYou know what? forget it. How about magicians?\u201d\u201cMagicians are so rare, my lady. I\u2019ve never heard anyone hiring one before, but if you ask the Count\u2026it might be possible. So, is your man a magician then?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that!\u201d\u201cThen why are you looking for a magician? I\u2019m sure you know that magic isn\u2019t something you can learn?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t learn magic?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not! Only those who have the goddess\u2019s blood are able to use magic. The guy you have in mind must be a magician. Am I wrong?\u201dYellie winked at Amethyst.\u201cYou can leave, Yellie,\u201d said Amethyst sternly.Amethyst sighed. \u2018Forget it.\u2019\u201cOkay, my lady. Froy will be coming soon, so please get ready. Don\u2019t delay.\u201d Yellie closed the door and left the room. She stopped monetarily and turned back to look at the closed door. Amethyst made a face each time Yellie asked her if her man was a knight or a magician, and Yellie found that interesting.\u2018Something is different about the young lady. She used to be very keen on corsets, wearing only dresses that emphasize her her waist, saying that it was her only strong point. But these days she barely dresses up! She suddenly thinks her corset is stuffy, uncomfortable and burdensome and always wears clothes that one would only wear in the bedroom. Well she was always in her room so that explains it partly, but on days like this one when her tutor is visiting, it would be more appropriate if she wore her a nice dress.Nonetheless, despite these thoughts, Yellie did not want to nag Amethyst further.Amethyst didn\u2019t care for Yellie\u2019s suggestions on the other hand. She had her own considerations to mull over.\u2018Only those who carried the goddess\u2019s blood, which means they must be of royal blood. In school we learned that the goddess\u2019s descendant became the king and ruled the Sehar empire. The Lohikin family is not a descendant of the goddess. They cannot learn magic. But from what I know \u2013 the only one of royal blood is the current emperor and the royal sibling. It can\u2019t be that there are only two magicians in the land. Since blood is passed down from the predecessors, the wizards will be the eldest sons of the royal family and their brothers-in-law, and so on. In the end, it might be a complete stranger.\u2019\u2018The Emperor who was the direct descendant with the purest blood of the goddess might be the greatest magician.\u2019\u201cWhat a pity. I wanted to try Wingardium Leviosa! To think that I have no chance!\u201dWhile she was lost in her thoughts, her teacher Froy had arrived and settled down.\u201cRight. Let\u2019s study about the world tree today.\u201d\u201cThe world tree? Ah, the goddess that became the tree\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u2018Was it really necessary to study a tree? Well, since it is a part of the myth it would be weird not to know about it. Like the Korean myth of Dangeun. Guess I could ask what I\u2019m the most curious about first. \u2018\u201cDoes it really exist?\u201d\u201cOf course! It is being carefully taken care of in a shrine in the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cThen it must be very old.\u201d\u201cTo be precise, it is 6193 years 5 months and 20 days old.\u201d\u201cWhat? How do you know that so accurately?\u201d\u201cHow could you not know this, Lady Lohikin?\u201d\u201cAh, I knew. I just wondered.\u201d\u2018The world tree must be the equivalent of a calendar here. Now that I think about it they said the empire started once the goddess fell asleep as a world tree.\u2019\u2018I must study hard. The local myths seem really important here.\u2019\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFroy looked at her with a curious look that seemed to question her mental aptitude, but Amethyst paid no attention.She asked cautiously, \u201cHow about you Froy? Have you seen it before?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not a tree anyone can just pay a visit to see. But my cousin in the Large shrine is a disciple. I heard he is taking care of the tree.\u201d\u201cWow. If a goddess turned into a tree, I\u2019m sure it is a very beautiful tree.\u201d\u201cYes, I hear that it is exactly like it is described. A white tree always adorned with evergreen leaves. And when the sun shines upon it, the leaves turn golden.\u201d\u201cGolden? That must be splendid to watch.\u201d\u201cThere is something even more fascinating. Although I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true. It is sort of a rumor.\u201dAmethyst encouraged Froy to continue. He was suddenly cautious, unlike his usual self.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMy cousin says that the number of leaves that fall from the tree each day and the number of people guided to god each day are the same.\u201d\u201cGuided to god?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you even know what that means? It means death.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSome people might not know.\u00a0Amethyst muttered internally.\u00a0Wait a second, they seemed to refer to the funerals as those guided to god.\u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed, as I said. My cousin is one of the people studying the phenomenon, so nothing is proven yet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 Finding Lady Lohikin\u201cPfft, Froy you don\u2019t seem to trust your cousin very much.\u201d Amethyst remarked teasingly.\u201cWell, he\u2019s such a clumsy fellow, that it\u2019s questionable how he became a disciple, in the first place. Anyway, the world tree stands for the empire and is also the royal emblem; the Empress\u2019s seal carries this sign. \u201dShe suddenly recalled Yellie mentioning an invitation from the palace and catching a glimpse of the emblem.\u201cOh! I received an invitation from the palace sometime ago, so that tree on the seal was the world tree!\u201d\u201cAh yes! You must be referring to the commemoration party for the completion of the Belecian palace. That\u2019s right. There are only two royal families that use an emblem of the world tree. The Roden household and the Skad household.\u201d*On the night of the Commemoration party, people were in awe of the Belecian palace as they went in, remarking that it was a perfect embodiment of the Empress\u2019s strength and spirit.It apparently was the best of all the palaces built by former Emperors; people took pride in its significance of how rich and powerful the Sehar empire currently was.\u2018This palace really is beautiful\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen any other architecture this grand. I wonder if the jewels there are real? They must be, it\u2019s the Empress\u2019s palace, after all.\u2019The banquet was held in the Highlander hall, supported by marble columns, and decorated with cream-colored ivory decorations. To add to the splendour, the walls were decorated with gold and jewels. The high ceiling reflected dazzling lights, enhanced by a wizard\u2019s barrier buff, infinitely like the Milky Way.The Empress\u2019s love for flowers was evident in the decorations; flowers of the most beautiful shades, of various shapes and sizes adorned the hall, adding their own unique fragrances to the atmosphere.Amethyst, who had never seen such grandeur and splendour in her life, began to feel self-conscious of her dress, that was far too ordinary for such an elite gathering.\u2018I should have dressed up a bit more. No, not for myself, god knows there\u2019s nothing in this party for me, but to keep up the Count\u2019s reputation. I am here as his daughter, after all. Maybe the make-up will pass, but the dress will surely draw glances, and not the admiring kind.\u2019She felt small amongst the other young ladies, who were dolled-up for the occasion and rightly so, for she was dressed in a plain cream-white, square-necked chiffon dress, with flute sleeves. A green ribbon encircling her slim waist, accentuated her slender physique and was the only accessory she wore.She had deliberately chosen a modest dress to not attract attention towards herself, but it seemed that she had failed miserably in her attempt.Everywhere she looked, people, it seemed, were whispering about her inadequate dressing for such an important official event.She conceded that they were right and consoled herself. \u2018Don\u2019t think about it anymore. It\u2019s too late to do anything now. This event is not hosted for me, after all. Once, the Empress enters, they\u2019ll forget all about me.\u2019She sighed deeply.\u00a0I guess there\u2019s no other choice but to stay quietly for a while and then leave.Emelis smiled awkwardly and started to walk away, towards a corner of the banquet hall. Thankfully, people quickly lost interest in her.*A little while later, she was glad she had moved. Snuggled in a corner, she checked out the men in the party, grinning like Cheshire Cats.\u2018Wow. This is like a gathering of all the beautiful people in the Empire. Were all the men in this world this handsome? I\u2019m so glad I came here tonight. What a treat for my eyes!\u2019Amethyst gauged them in great detail.\u2018He looks like he\u2019s meant to be a singer with that deep voice and gorgeous face. Wow! That guy has an amazing physique, he should certainly be a choreographer.\u2019\u2018Mmm\u2026This one definitely looks like the lead singer of a boy-band. He\u2019s not exactly handsome but has his own roguish charm, better than the leader of the idol group on MTV that\u2019s been around for years!\u2019\u2018Oh yes! That girl has character\u2026You can tell from one look at her face. She\u2019s like an actress who\u2019s been through all sorts of hardship; she just stands out.\u2019The event turned out surprisingly fun. Emelis was enjoying herself, grinning from ear to ear when she heard the announcement of the Empress\u2019s entrance indicating the official commencement of the party.\u201cYour majesty the Empress, Belice Frostin.\u201d\u201cFollowed by Duke Alexcent Frostin du Skad and Duke Michen Mui Roden.\u201dAll eyes were fixed on the Empress Belice, the Duke of Skad, and the Duke of Roden. Everyone turned and knelt to greet them, their voices ringing out in unison.\u201cMay the glory of the great Sehar empire and the blessing of her majesty Emperor Belice be with you!\u201dBelice, who wore a red-wine coloured dress that highlighted her wise red-coloured eyes and a golden belt with elaborate woodwork symbolising the world tree, that accentuated her narrow waist, smiled in benevolence.\u201cEveryone, lift your heads. Thank you for coming to the commemoration party of the Belecian palace. Words cannot express how happy I am. For today, let us forget about formalities and enjoy ourselves. Now let the evening begin.\u201dAs Belice finished her speech with a smile, the sound of applause and the orchestra announced the beginning of the evening.Duke Skad\u2019s eyes wandered around the room as if searching for someone, he asked Gen without looking at him.\u201cWhere is that young lady you mentioned?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 An Honest RejectionAs the Duke of Skad scanned the young ladies in the crowd one by one, the ones that had made eye contact with the duke started to make a fuss. It was a natural reaction, after all, his handsome looks, as beautiful as Empress Belice, were very popular among the ladies. His status as an eligible bachelor fueled their covetousness, for the position of being the Duchess of Skad, was the second- highest position for a woman after the Empress.The materialistic young ladies, ecstatically eager to capture the attention and heart of the duke, tried their best to hide their excitement.\u201cDuke Skad, I hope you don\u2019t forget that it was I who organised this party. You have no right to glare at these young ladies.\u201d Belice, who stood beside him, leaned over and whispered.\u201cYour Highness, what do you mean, glaring? Of course, not. I was simply trying to acquaint myself with each and every one of these beautiful ladies.\u201dBelice glared menacingly at the duke and smiled.\u201cJust so you know Alexcent, if you don\u2019t get married by the end of this year we will cut off all business budgets for this year and the next and all budgets that you are in charge of. Oh and, of course, your two legs as well.\u201d Saying those words, Empress Belice took Duke Roden\u2019s hand and walked towards the dance hall.In the palace, every party started with the Empress\u2019s first dance.\u201cTsk, she really has a bad temper. So Gen, where is she? The young lady, you told me about. Emily or Eme something?\u201dGen who had been scanning the room for Amethyst, finally found her and very discreetly, pointed her out with his gaze to the duke.\u201cYour joke is way out of line.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, what do you mean?\u201dGen asked innocently, pretending to be oblivious to what the duke was referring to. Alescent cleared his throat and glared at him, one eyebrow raised.\u201cDressed to a palace party in what one would wear on a stroll. Is the Lohikin household having a hard time?\u201d\u201cOf course not. They may not have a title worthy of the treasury department, but they own a private bank.\u201d\u201cThen how do you explain that fashion?\u201d\u201cI guess the young lady is modest.\u201d\u201cFine, let\u2019s say that\u2019s the case for the dress. What about her looks? She\u2019s not my type.\u201d\u201cHmm. But it\u2019s only a contract marriage so looks shouldn\u2019t really matter\u2026\u201d\u201cGen, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you in the training ground. Report to the training ground for work tomorrow at five.\u201d\u201cYour Highness! Tomorrow is my day off.\u201d\u201cPrecisely why. What\u2019s the point of taking a rest? Let\u2019s work out together.\u201dGen could only reply in the affirmative, as the duke smiled at him through clenched teeth. The Duke of Skad, then walked over to the corner where the young Lady Lohikin was situated.Amethyst, meanwhile, oblivious to the murmuring around her, had transferred her focus from the handsome young men to the food. She was now scrutinizing the food the same way as she had done the men earlier.\u2018Oh my, look at this cute rabbit shaped chocolate. What is this cookie? It looks like the galaxy is flowing out of it.\u2019\u2018Oh my god they sprayed the tart with gold!\u2019\u2018Wow! A cookie with a whole fruit!\u2019\u201cThey just melt in your mouth!\u201d\u00a0Just as she closed her eyes and hummed in appreciation of the taste and flavours, a figure appeared behind Amethyst and cleared his throat.\u201cGood evening, Miss.\u201dAmethyst turned around to look at the duke, her eyes wide and mouth full of chocolate. The people around her hushed suddenly as pin-drop silence prevailed, with everyone\u2019s cold gazes directed towards her.\u201cWho?\u201d Amethyst asked in confusion.The duke raised his eyebrows, unpleasantly surprised, but soon they returned to their original position.His eyes shone with unwarranted arrogant as though to say \u2018don\u2019t you know who I am?\u2019\u201cI am Duke Alexcent Skad. Miss.\u201d\u201cI am Heeyeo-, no Amethyst Lohikin.\u201dShe had never said her new name out loud and couldn\u2019t help but stutter over it.\u2018Did she just stutter? What a package.\u2019 Duke Skad thought to himself as he stared down at Amethyst expressionlessly. As there was no reaction, Amethyst wondered if she missed out on something or done something horribly wrong.\u2018Was this not what she was supposed to do?\u2019She quickly greeted him in return as he continued to look piercingly at her. \u201cAhem. It\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d\u2018What is up, why is this duke speaking to me? And so hostilely at that? Did I rip him off before? But oh my! He\u2019s really good looking.\u2019As she inspected the man who had engaged her in a conversation, she was amazed.Neatly combed platinum hair, red and alluring eyes looked down at her. Sharp nose and chin, broad shoulders. His black tail-coat did not hide his well defined body and thick thighs.\u2018He\u2019s like the hero of a novel! Wow, compared to the other guys from before this guys is the ultimate deal. He ranks No. 1! Just looking at him makes me happy.\u2019The duke noticed the look in her eyes and continued the conversation after a moment of silence.\u201cMiss Lohikin, I would like to ask you for a dance. Would you do me the honour?\u201dAt those words, the murmuring started again. It was a surprise that the Duke of Skad had turned up at the party, but to think that he was asking a young lady for a dance! Even Empress Belice had never seen the duke dancing since his social debut!Whilst everyone was in shock, you could see the audience fall under two categories. One consisted of a group eager to see the duke dance, and the other was a group of young ladies who raged with barely suppressed fury, not wanting anyone else but themselves to dance with the duke.\u201cExcuse me, Duke Skad, but I\u2019m afraid my dancing skills will cause you much embarrassment. Kindly withdraw your invitation.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 By Hook or by Crook (1)\u2018Was that the right way to phrase it? Why did this guy appear out of the blue and ask me for a dance? Is something wrong with his eyesight? There are way prettier girls out here. Just from his looks, he looks like he has sky-high standards. Or did he have a preference? How peculiar!\u2019Amethyst was overwhelmed, at first by the extravagant party she was attending, and now by the proposed dancing. She wasn\u2019t confident of her dancing skills and tried to avert the impending humiliation by politely declining the duke\u2019s proposal.However, if a young lady from a noble family couldn\u2019t dance, it would be the talk of the town. Her already delicate relationship with Count Lohikin, her supposed father, would be under unnecessary stress; she didn\u2019t want to humiliate the household any further.\u2018Is that what your parents taught you?\u2019Perhaps she was hearing things, but she thought she heard a familiar voice, her mother in law\u2019s whenever she taunted her.Suddenly, dizziness took over her.\u2018I am not Kim Heeyeon. Amethyst. I am Amethyst Lohikin.\u2019Amethyst shook her head, her heart beating fast and her face pale.Looking at the panicking Amethyst, the duke thought to himself.\u2018Well I guess she doesn\u2019t stutter.\u2019He wasn\u2019t one to give up just because he was rejected. \u201cWell. If that\u2019s how you feel Miss Lohikin. Shall we go for a walk? You don\u2019t look very well at the moment.\u201dThe duke\u2019s voice was just as great as his looks. Deep and low, it made you want to listen to it over and over again, until you fell asleep with the warmth and comfort it made you feel.His voice drove away the self-doubting voices in her head.\u2018Would it be too rude to refuse him once more?\u2019\u2018Wait, Duke Skad\u2026? Oh, I remember now.\u2019The royal family that Froy mentioned. The same hair as the emperor, the red eyes. He was the emperor\u2019s one and only brother.Oh my! Why did I only realise it now? It would be unpardonable if I gave him the wrong impression.As the duke hadn\u2019t withdrawn his invitation, Amethyst decided she needed some fresh air and nodded before replying. \u201cIf you\u2019re fine with taking someone like me\u2026 I\u2019m curious as to what the palace looks like. I would be honoured.\u201d\u201cThen let me escort you, this way.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe duke offered her his hand and Amethyst hesitantly placed hers on top of his. She could feel the coldness of the duke\u2019s hand even though they were wearing gloves. He smiled and led her out of the banquet ball and towards the garden. As they passed the crowd, deep sighs were heard, and some young ladies even fainted.Belice was the only person in the hall who was glad at the sight of the two.*The garden in the Belecian palace, though not as large or grand as the one in the imperial palace, was surrounded by well-grown trees and flowers that swayed in the wind showing off their unique colours.The elegant figures of a man and woman walked down the flower trail in the darkness. Amethyst inhaled deeply the fresh scent of roses. With the fancy Belecian palace in the background she felt refreshed and much better.Past the flower trail she could hear the sound of water running, and soon they were standing by a small marble fountain.With water splashing in the background, Amethyst looked at the duke and asked boldly.\u201cDuke Skad, do you have something you wish to say?\u201dShe was quick to read a situation after eleven years of living with her in laws. She was not a self-deluded; out of the many beautiful young ladies, he had approached her and engaged her in a conversation without a moment\u2019s hesitation. She was not special in her appearance so it could only mean that he had business with either her or her family.The duke stopped walking and looked at Amethyst. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re not slow. Good it\u2019ll make things easier.\u201d\u201cDuke Skad? You sound rather rude\u2026..\u201d\u201cDoes that upset you?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Amethyst lifted the fan in her hand and covered her mouth as though she was laughing.The sudden change of his attitude had caught her off guard. Nevertheless, she pretended to be unaffected since he was of a higher rank, a duke, at that, even though she was churning with annoyance on the inside.\u2018Look at this fellow ! I\u2019m obviously older than you! He has no manners at all!\u2019\u00a0Nonetheless, Amethyst tried to act naturally and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll send a carriage to your place tomorrow. Take that and come over.\u201d Alexcent announced to her in a monotonous voice.\u201cTo where?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, what is this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean why?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2018What was he going on about out of the blue? Go where? This guy is pretty reckless in contrast with how he looks. And he sure knows how to piss me off!\u2019Amethyst, a strong character herself, had promised herself that, in this world, she would live without being suppressed by others and do only what she wanted.She huffed in barely restrained irritation.\u201cUnbelievable! Duke Skad, I think you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not someone who you can order around. How could you be so rude to someone you\u2019ve just met? If you need to see me then you should be the one to come over! Well, excuse me.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t be bothered to hear a reply. Amethyst making her point, retraced her steps and exited the garden.Going back to the banquet hall would only draw attention, she decided, it would be better to go home. What a pity that she couldn\u2019t taste all the food!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 \u2013 By Hook or by Crook (2)The morning after the party, Amethyst overslept as usual, but today the one waking her up wasn\u2019t Yellie, it was Count Lohikin.\u201cAmethyst, Amethyst! Wake up, quickly! Did something happen yesterday?\u201d\u201cMmmm, ten more minutes\u2026okay five more.\u201d\u201cAmethyst! Duke Skad is waiting in the drawing room. Wake up right this instant!\u201d\u2018Duke Skad ?!\u2019The anxious and desperate tone of the Count made her sit up.\u201cWhat\u2019s that ass doing here?\u201d\u201cAss\u2026what?! Where did you learn to say such a thing! Ahem, anyway do get up. Did something happen at the party yesterday?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing happened\u2026oooh!\u201d Realization dawned on her.\u2018Right. I told him to come over himself if he had business with me. And he really came? At this early hour?\u2019\u201cFather, I will get ready first. Yellie, come and help me get dressed! Anything simple. It\u2019ll take too long to wear the complicated ones. We can\u2019t keep him waiting when he came all the way here.\u201dCount Lohikin left the room unable to say anything else as Amethyst was acting so casually. He went to keep the duke company while she got herself ready. After all, It was rude to leave the duke unattended.Thankfully, Yellie was quick with her hands and Amethyst was now ready without a moment\u2019s delay. She opened the door to the drawing room and entered. The duke was leisurely seated on the sofa reading today\u2019s newspaper, standing behind him was Gen. Opposite him was Count Lohikin who was anxiously glancing at his form.The Lohikin household was able to sustain a fortune and status of a noble household but they were far off from the influential and powerful royal family.Above all, even though the Count was working in public office and frequented the Imperial palace, he was not in a position where he could have a direct audience with the Emperor or the Duke of Skad. That was done by his boss, the Treasury Secretary and Vice Minister.How could he not be anxious and covered in sweat when such a guest was in his house, sitting in his drawing room, reading a newspaper? To make things worse he was called the \u2018Bloody Duke.\u2019!As he was secretly glancing and appreciating the presence of the duke, Amethyst entered the drawing room.\u201cOh my, Duke Skad, I\u2019m flattered by your visit.\u201d\u201cLady Lohikin, Good morning.\u201dAfter exchanging greetings, Gen asked the Count for a private audience. Reading the room, the Count Lohikin agreed and left the room with Gen gratefully.When only the two of them remained in the drawing room, Amethyst spoke first. \u201cWhy are you here so early in the morning? It can\u2019t possibly be because you wanted to see me.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I did want to see you, Lady Lohikin.\u201d The duke smiled in his most charming way. He was in a hurry to sign the contract with Amethyst, so he had to please her as much as he could.Amethyst struggled to hold back a snort. She easily ignored the duke\u2019s smile and got to the point.\u201cOh, is that so? Then why didn\u2019t you let me know beforehand? I would have bathed and gotten ready from dawn and waited for you, Duke Skad.\u201dA frown formed on the duke\u2019s head but quickly disappeared.\u2018She doesn\u2019t lose out. She\u2019s different from the other young ladies. She kind of reminds me of someone.\u2019\u00a0The duke shook his head as he thought of Belice and her snappy tongue.\u201cYou must not be very bright. I believe I told you yesterday that I will send a carriage over.\u201d\u201cOh, was I supposed to say \u2018thank you so much!\u2019 and follow you just because you sent a carriage over? I\u2019ve never met you in my entire life; why should I trust you?\u201d\u201cHey, what do you take me for? I\u2019m sure my rumors are not that bad!\u201d was Alexcent\u2019s defense.\u201cRumours? Anyways, I\u2019m sure you have an objective. What do you want?\u201d She didn\u2019t know a single rumour about the duke. If it was something irrelevant to her life, she had no reason to find out.\u201cLady Lohikin, let me offer you a proposal. One that we can both gain benefit from.\u201d\u201cWhich is?\u201dThe duke looked around as if to hint that this was not the appropriate location. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to talk about here. I will send you a carriage tomorrow. Come to my mansion tomorrow and I\u2019ll tell you then.\u201d\u201cAnd what if I refuse?\u201d She said haughtily.The duke then smiled once more, before saying, \u201cThen it\u2019ll end up like this. Gen!\u201dGen and a group of armed knights of the duke must have been waiting outside, as they suddenly barged in the room.\u201cEscort the Lady. Now.\u201d He ordered. By hook or by crook, he would get her.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 \u2013 Her Demands (1)The duke replied dryly and stood up. Gen looked toward the duke\u2019s knights and nodded, upon which they surrounded Amethyst.\u201cI beg your pardon, Lady Lohikin. Please forgive us for this rudeness.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to kidnap me from my own house? Father! Father!\u201d Amethyst called out to Count Lohikin, but there was no response from outside the room.\u201cCount Lohikin has left the house momentarily at our request.\u201d Gen replied kindly.\u201cCome on!\u201d*\u2018This has to be an abduction!\u2019\u00a0Amethyst fumed. She had initially been with Count Lohikin, but was now in Duke Skad\u2019s drawing room.\u2018Duke Alexent Skad- the culprit could only be him!\u2019His silky, platinum hair that was always brushed back, combined with his captivating red eyes were irresistably intoxicating.Not now, Amethyst. She silently scolded herself. With her arms folded across her chest, she huffed and puffed, making sure he knew she was displeased. She glared at the duke. However, he seemed unbothered by her reaction.\u201cLady Lohikin, let me make you a proposal.\u201dAmethyst was far too angry to really pay attention to him, but he continued.\u201cHave you ever heard of the term\u00a0contract marriage?\u201d\u201cContract\u2026what?\u201d She was taken by surprise, her eyebrows raised and her mouth wide open at the thought.\u00a0First, it was an abduction and now a contract marriage.Amethyst started to wonder if Duke Skad was losing his mind.\u201cYes, a contract marriage. Just so you know, I believe in celibacy. However, I find myself in this complication situation where marriage cannot be avoided. I need the help of a noble lady who can pretend to be my spouse for some time.\u201d\u201cWhy does it have to be me? I have grown up despising the entire idea of marriage. I don\u2019t even like mentioning it!\u201d\u201cHuh, Lady Lohikin, then you and I are very much alike. I too hate that word \u2018marriage\u2019. But you know your father won\u2019t let you spend your life alone. You can\u2019t avoid it forever. Consider it a sort of collateral. Let\u2019s help each other out. It\u2019ll be just a single year that you will have to endure me.\u201dAmethyst quickly calculated her options. It was an attractive offer, she could not deny that.Her father, Count Lohikin, may be appeased for now, but he would certainly push her into a marriage with someone she highly disapproves of. There is no guarantee that she would be able to convince him otherwise. If she were to accept the duke\u2019s proposal however, she could buy more time. She would even be in control of who she marries.She turned towards the duke. \u201cWhat happens after the year is over?\u201d\u201cWhatever pleases you. We can publicly divorce, or I can help you start a new life somewhere else, far away from this madness. We can pretend you died in a sudden illness or an accident. I will even be able to live as a widower, mourning my dead wife forever. People will understand my desire to be alone then.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t really kill me, will you?\u201d\u201cPlease, Lady Lohikin, I am an honorable man. You will have my protection.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that. Prove to me that you will keep your promise.\u201d\u201cFine, how shall I prove it?\u201d Amethyst mulled over her options.\u2018Should I leave it as a document? No. Even if I were to get it notarised, what would be the use of a document when I\u2019m already dead. It\u2019ll obviously be a secret contract between us so I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t agree to it. What should I do?\u2019\u2018Oh! The world tree. They said the world tree is the most important being in these lands. It is like a ruler. Since Duke Skad is in line to the throne, I am sure he thinks highly of the world tree.\u2019\u201cAlright. Swear upon the world tree!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI heard the world tree is like a goddess. You\u2019re a member of the royal family, and the royals are descendants of the goddess, so swear upon your ancestor: that you will not kill me and that you will protect my life. Do it.\u201dThe duke was speechless. He stared at Amethyst, his gaze becoming intense with every second and his fiery eyes almost burning with emotion.He spoke finally.\u201cFine, I will swear it upon the world tree. I, Alexcent Frostin du Skad will protect your life no matter what. Will that do?\u201dA shiver ran down Amethyst\u2019s spine at that response. But she persevered.\u201cOkay then. How much solatium are you going to give me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re even going to request for a solatium? You\u2019re quite a deal maker, aren\u2019t you?\u201cHow am I supposed to live without a penny to my name after one year has passed. By then I would no longer be the consort of a duke, neither a daughter of a Count.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. So how much would you need?\u201dAmethyst started to regret that she didn\u2019t learn the currency of Sehar when she had the time. Hence, she could only give a broad statement which didn\u2019t need her providing specific numbers.\u201cI think 10 years worth of pay from your work and two buildings you own somewhere. That should be fair.\u201d\u201cWhat? You sound like you are ready to rip me off, dear Lady.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you grasp the situation. I am in no need of this \u2018contract\u2019. I don\u2019t lose out either way. If you don\u2019t like my offer, we can forget about the marriage.\u201d\u2018There is no way he is getting off so easily.\u2019She knew she had been audacious, but she did not want to back down.The duke looked at her, studying her for a moment. \u201cFine, let\u2019s do it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 \u2013 Her Demands (2)Amethyst drew in her breath.\u00a0Oh my. Did he just agree? Did I just agree to marriage?\u00a0She felt giddy with excitement and fear both at the same time.In any case, she would be free one year from now.\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s discuss the terms of this contract. We will be living in separate bedrooms, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, but I will drop by occasionally since the maids will be observing. They will notice.\u201d\u201cOkay, we do need to keep them fooled. As for the wedding, I would like it to be a grand affair.\u201dThe duke raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising. I always took you for a girl with minimal tastes.\u201d\u201cA big wedding is every woman\u2019s dream, and I do need to play the part.\u201d Amethyst smirked. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t actually fall in love with me and try to skew our contract.\u201dThe duke frowned. \u201cHow ridiculous! That will never happen.\u201d\u201cHave you never read any romance novels? It\u2019s a pretty common storyline. Anyway, even if you do fall in love with me, I hope you won\u2019t expect me to reciprocate. I am leaving you as soon as our contract is up!\u201dThe duke once again ran his fingers through his hair and seemed to study Amethyst.\u201cDo you really believe a face like yours is easy to fall in love with?\u201d\u201cWhat! You ras\u2026\u201d\u201cPardon me, miss, what did you say?\u201dAmethyst put on a smile and grinned through her teeth, \u201cNothing at all, never mind. I must have read too many books\u201d.Duke Skad gave her icy smile of his own in return. \u201cYou should be careful of falling head over heels in love with me, lady.\u201d\u201cHa! That will never happen, sir\u201d, Amethyst rolled her eyes at him.\u201cWhy makes you so sure?\u201dIf he ever lived in Korea, he would never want to get married. Guess he also haven\u2019t heard of Generation Y \u2013 those who have renounced the entire institution of marriage.Amethyst focused on Duke Skad. She could not speak these thoughts aloud, so she came up with another response.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe in staying with a single person all my life. That is boring.\u201d\u2018With beautiful idols in my past life, it was indeed hard to settle with one person.\u2019\u00a0She thought, amused with her own train of thoughts.An image of a dance group member ran through Amethyst\u2019s mind and she shrugged the thought away.Duke Skad was ready with his rebuttal. \u201cWhat? With that face, miss, you will be lucky if you can find even one person to commit to you.\u201dAmethyst glared at the Duke.\u201cOkay, maybe you are right. Whatever, it is not my concern\u201d, he quickly added, trying to douse the heavy air between them. Amethyst shrugged and changed the conversation. \u201cSo will this do?\u201d\u201cYes, I will announce the engagement tomorrow. We will have the wedding in a month\u2019s time and exactly a year from now we will part ways.\u201d\u201cThat sounds good. Can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Duke Skad was wary of Amethyst at this point.\u201cCome on! You don\u2019t even know what it is.\u201d\u201cExactly why I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\u201cYou are so stubborn. I am still going to ask. Why do you want to have a contract marriage?\u201d\u201cJust like that.\u201d\u201cJust like that?!\u201dHe didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he withdrew and became silent. Amethyst could tell his mind was not in the room anymore.A vision of fiery red eyes resurfaced in Alexcent\u2019s memory. A promise had been made to the previous emperor, but he could not deny himself the desire to hold a sword in his hand. He was born to yield a sword. He had begun playing with swords the moment he had learned to grab things as a young child. Alexcent had learned to control a sword as soon as he was taught to properly carry one.Ever since he\u2019d been old enough to yield a sword, the duke had traversed countless battlefields, fighting gallantly and killing mercilessly, with only the kingdom\u2019s protection and prosperity in mind.He had finally been able to shed his sword only when the war ended and Sehar had finally risen as the Great Empire.His last battle, was a memory he hated to revisit in his mind.Firmly gripping his sharp, blood-stained sword, he had cut through everything, alive and breathing, that had crossed his path, soaking himself in their blood over and over again.The lands he passed were flooded with corpses, while the few spared, knelt in front of him cowering in fear, begging for his mercy when he had none left.Once victory was secured and declared, Belice, who had become the Empress not long ago, arrived at the battlefield to cheer her soldiers on and uplift their morale. The figure of Belice riding a horse on a canyon was the personification of strength and power.He would never forget the look in her eyes, when she looked at him, standing under the meandering canyon, until the day he died. Her eyes embodied the petrification of someone who had seen the vilest monster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 \u2013 Love at First Sight (1)Belice, that day was like the noble being, she always had been; she was herself. The duke, in stark contrast, had degraded himself to a savage beast, so overcome with bloodlust that he was a stranger to his own sister.He witnessed her transparent feelings of fear, anguish, heart break and repulsion reflect in her eyes.He, who had solely led his life for her happiness, constantly sought her approval, felt as though his existence itself was being rejected. The thought shattered his already-fractured soul into a billion tiny fragments.When she had smile, he had laughed, when she was unhappy it would make him melancholic for days. To the duke in his younger days, she was his everything. He was she and she was he.That look of utter disgust, received from her had determined that his life, thereafter, would be far more shameful than death itself. He had felt a chill run down his spine. For the first time in his life, he was introduced to fear in its most glorious element.He did not want his existence to be rejected by anyone ever again. He couldn\u2019t grant them the authority to invalidate every decision he\u2019d made in his life by making him feel ashamed of his own self.It would be better to live his life alone, in total isolation, than to live in a constant fear of rejection.It was then that the duke who had turned into a monster, shut the door to his heart.Of course, there was no need to explain all of this to Amethyst, a complete stranger entering his life for a fleeting period of time who sat opposite him, patiently awaiting his response.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s to ensure my privacy and freedom and also, my sister\u2019s inner peace.\u201d\u201cAh! Speaking of privacy and freedom. From the moment the engagement is engaged and until this marriage is annulled, you can\u2019t have an extramarital affair with another woman.\u201d\u201cWhat do you take me for?!\u201d He asked disgruntled.\u201cNot even an affair with a man.\u201d She answered cheekily.His eyes widened in surprise.\u201cWhat? Are you\u2026serious right npw? \u201cShe giggled, heartily amused. \u201cAw, you can be endearing when you want to be.\u201dAmethyst smiled at him in delight, while he blew his top.\u2018And here I thought that good looks were the only department he was blessed in.\u2019She may lie to herself, but his good looks had played a large part in her agreeing to the whole sham. She, who loathed even the mention of marriage, had been convinced just because he was so dreamy to look at. It would certainly make the relationship more bearable.She reasoned with herself.\u2018Even if a man\u2019s face isn\u2019t everything, it is something when what lies underneath is just the same in every member of the species. Might as well pick one with good looks. Unappealing ones were even more useless.\u2019From that aspect, he was the best possible option.Heeyon, who was living the second chapter of her life, an ultra premium upgraded version of her first, at that, had nothing to be afraid of.\u201cIt\u2019s Alec.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cMy name. Call me Alec.\u201d\u201cThen call me Amethyst as well.\u201d\u201cAlright. Ash.\u201d\u201cAsh? My name is Emesis.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201dShe sighed.\u00a0I am not going to argue with him. This stubborn fool won\u2019t listen to me even if I correct him, what\u2019s the point?And thus began the contract marriage with the duke, who called her whatever he pleased.*The next morning, The Royal Palace and the entire empire was in an uproar by the news of the matrimony of Duke Skad and Count Lohikin\u2019s daughter.The scandal caused a storm, yet the two people involved were strangely tranquil.\u2018It had been the first proposal of his life.\u2019\u201cKarune, check if it is true.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I have checked, and it seems to be true.\u201d\u201cReally? Within a day? Can this really happen?\u201d Belice couldn\u2019t believe the fact even as she re-read the letter sent from the duke\u2019s estate.\u201cWhy, Belice? Even you fell for Duke Roden at first sight and made such a scene to marry him, right? I hope you haven\u2019t forgotten already?\u201d Alexcent, who came unannounced, stood grinning, leaning against the doorway of the his siter empress\u2019 office.Belice\u2019s crimson eyes were fixed at the sparkling ones mirroring hers, set in her brother\u2019s face.\u201cSo, you fell for her at first sight? You?\u201dHe answered flippantly, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s rather upsetting. Why can\u2019t I fall in love at first sight?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t. But honestly, it is unexpected. And also, to think that it would be Lady Lohikin.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019ll find out once you meet her. She is rather charming. You\u2019ll like her too.\u201dBelice sighed deeply, the next moment she spoke, her tone was diplomatic, \u201cIf you say so. Alright, Duke Skad. I invite you for tea tomorrow. You and your lady.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to come?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Are you afraid? If you find me evil, you should do your part as the fianc\u00e9 and protect her from her future sister-in-law\u2026when I meet her.\u201dBelice smiled coldly, finally having him exactly where she wanted to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 \u2013 Love at First Sight (2)Meanwhile, Count Lohikin had called on Amethyst and was at an utter loss for words. He desperately wanted to say something but didn\u2019t seem like he could bring himself to do so.Observing the Count, Amethyst was the first to speak. \u201cWill you consent? Tomorrow, Duke Skad will come by to greet you and to formally ask for my hand in marriage.\u201dThe count must have been shocked by the statement as his frown deepened.\u201cAmethyst, have you done something wrong to the duke? Are you in debt? Tell me honestly, is there anything father can do to help?\u201d\u201cNo! It\u2019s just that, he\u2026he lo\u2014loves\u2026\u201dShe should say he loved her right?Amethyst blushed scarlet at the thought of saying it out loud.\u201cIs it true? Why does Duke Skad feel that way towards you?\u201d asked her father, frowning, finding it strangely hard to believe.\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cNo, I mean there were no encounters so far. Hmm, anyway. So that must be why you rejected the previous marriage offers. As a duke, he is a member of the royal family. You must treat him with utmost respect at all times.\u201d\u201cFather, I am not going to serve him as a maid. I am getting married to him.\u201d\u201cWell, that is true too\u2026 But we are talking about the Duke of Skad. We can\u2019t forget that.\u201d Count Lohikin fell deep in thought before continuing once more. \u201cWell, since you say that you are in love, it should not be a problem. As long as you live well. I had been deeply worried because you said you didn\u2019t ever want to get married a few days ago, so it is a relief. Alright, so you are going to stay at the duke\u2019s estate until the marriage?\u201dAll of a sudden, she was reminded of how her real father, who had been indifferent to all her life, had shed a tear on the day of her wedding. Even her real father, who had been cold towards her had acted as such.Count Lohikin, on the other hand, was heavily invested in his family and was a warm and loving father to his children. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder momentarily, if she was making the right decision for the real Amethyst, the real daughter of the Count.She felt guilty at her choice of action, one that she had made purely for her own convenience. But the moment she had answered Duke Skad, the decision had been irrevocably made.As long as the real Amethyst did not return, and as long as she remained, things would suit her convenience.Amethyst approached Count Lohikin and hugged him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be nice. Duke Skad said it would be better for me to stay at his estate for my own safety. And that it would be good for me to learn and prepare myself for what awaits me when I become his wife\u2026.\u201dCount Lohikin patted Amethyst\u2019s hands, as though to say he understood.Regardless of the situation, this was her family for now; the only people who cared for her unselfishly. It would be better to put some distance between them before she became too fond of them.This would be the best in preparation of what was inevitably going to happen in one year\u2019s time.\u201cFather, thank you. And I am sorry.\u201dHe brushed it off, \u201cHaha, what a thing to say.\u201d*The next day, Amethyst got up early to get ready, and sat waiting for Duke Skad\u2019s arrival as a precautionary measure; she had no idea when he might arrive.Not quite unexpectedly, the duke arrived early in the morning.Escorted by the Count\u2019s butler, the moment he entered the main hall of the house, as if she had been lying in wake of him, Amethyst sprinted towards him with open arms and embraced him tightly.\u201cAlec!\u201dAlexcent stared dumbfounded at Amethyst, who came running towards him, calling out his name, muttering under his breath, \u2018Did she eat something wrong yesterday?\u2019She hugged the duke\u2019s waist tightly and whispered surreptitiously in his ear.\u201cI finally convinced my father by telling him that we are desperate to get married because we are soooo in love, so play along, alright? Remember the conditions, never to get caught and be nice to one another\u2019s family!\u201dShe thought she heard a low groan, but Duke Skad immediately put on a fake loving smile and looked at Amethyst with adoration clear in his sparkling eyes.\u201cOh, my Ash! How happy I was on my way here from the estate!\u201dHe spoke loudly and bending down, punctuated each word with a kiss on Amethyst\u2019s apricot-colored lips.The kiss was unexpected. Amethyst, startled, tried to push him away, but as though he had expected her to, he hugged her even more tightly and pressed his lips intensely against hers.\u201cAhem.\u201d Behind them, Count Lohikin coughed dryly, not quite pleased witnessing the tableau they presented, while on his right, Countess Lohikin looked at them, beaming from ear to ear.\u201cOh my, you already have a pet-name for each other!\u201d*\u201cI simply did what you wanted me to.\u201d\u201cWhat? I never told you to kiss my lips, I just told you to play along!\u201dAfter they left the Count\u2019s house, Duke Skad and Amethyst quarrelled in the carriage, back to their usual selves.\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing. Who was the one who said we are getting married because we are in love? Besides, kissing isn\u2019t the only thing married couples do.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cThen did you think we would go to sleep only holding hands?\u201dScandalized, she gasped, \u201cWe never talked about such things in the contract!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, I mean, we\u2019re getting married! You were the one who said you can\u2019t be satisfied with one man. So, don\u2019t pretend to be an innocent and naive young lady.\u201d\u2018When did I ever say that?\u2019\u00a0Amethyst blushed scarlet at that, and cried in indignation, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d\u2018He seems to have misunderstood. No, I think I have created a misunderstanding.\u2019She contemplated how to resolve the issue, but the duke spoke first,\u201cI wonder who said no woman or man during the contract period? Do you expect me to be alone for a whole year?\u201d\u2018Uhh\u2026 Yes?\u2019She was at a loss of words. His words weren\u2019t entirely wrong. But even so it was beyond her. Her mind might belong to Heeyeon, but her body belonged solely to Amethyst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 \u2013 A Wife\u2019s Duty (1)\u201cAlec, we need to clarify the terms of the contract.\u201d Just as Amethyst had been about to discuss the points she wanted to clarify in the contract, the carriage came to a halt. The duke promptly alighted and offered his hand to Amethyst in a very gentlemanly fashion.Taking it, she stepped down and looked up at the grand building in front of her, her eyes widening in surprise, the second she realized where they were.\u201cBut this is the royal palace. Why are we here?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with a family. Did you forget about my sister? We\u2019ve been invited to tea.\u201dAlmost on the verge of panicking, she turned to give him an accusatory glare, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell me about it, earlier?\u201d Amethyst vowed to add a clause of providing prior information of all social commitments to the contract later, if and when she managed returned to the mansion today.To her happy surprise, tea at the Royal Palace was simple.The only participants of the tea party, which took place in a quaint greenhouse, were the Empress herself, the duke, Amethyst, the three maids who served the tea and Sir Karune, the first secretary of the Imperial palace.The greenhouse was shaped like a large bird cage, with elaborate and beautiful decorations. As expected of the Empress who loved flowers, there were flowers that never withered and in full bloom, while outside the greenhouse dark green oak trees encircled the greenhouse, making the place feel like a secret room within a forest.However, Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous as she sat opposite the person who defined the beauty of the place and made all the flowers appear like bridesmaids.She truly was beauty personified. Seated together with the duke, the twins looked\u2026ha, what a pair of Have-it-all\u2019s!She had only seen her once from afar during the commemoration party. Amethyst had been amazed at the sight of Belice and the duke seated in front of her.Belice was the one to start the conversation. \u201cOh my, Lady Lohikin. I\u2019m so glad to finally meet you. Congratulations to the both of you on your engagement.\u201d\u201cThank you for your kindness, your majesty. Please feel free to comfortably refer to me as Amethyst.\u201dEven though she would be her sister-in-law, she was the emperor of an empire. It was the equivalent to meeting a president of a country.She was terrified but found herself relax slightly when she realized that Belice was making genuine efforts to make her comfortable. She spoke to Amethyst informally.\u201cOh, then shall I? I must confess, I\u2019ve been curious about the two of you. How did you fall in love?\u201d Belice asked, both curious and teasingly.Amethyst, who had expected such a question, answered without hesitation. \u201cI am embarrassed to say this to you, Your Majesty. But I met Duke Skad for the first time at the commemoration party and fell in love with him at first sight.\u201d\u201cThe party? That was the first time?\u201d\u201cYes. I was unable to take my eyes off Duke Skad as he took each step towards me\u2026and my heart pounded madly.\u201d Amethyst recalled a romance novel she had read before and recited whatever she remembered of the frivolous description of the female lead\u2019s feelings at her first encounter with the Hero.Belice listened to Amethyst with a smile on her face, not betraying whether she believed her or not.Suddenly feeling parched, Duke Skad brought his teacup to his lips as he recalled their first meeting, when Amethyst who had her mouth full of food hadn\u2019t even bothered to look at him as she answered his questions.\u201cThen, brother. You tell me. How it was for you. How did you fall in love?\u201d Belice asked with a smiling face that didn\u2019t seem to be smiling at all.Duke Skad seemed slightly taken aback as the blinding beams of her attention were suddenly turned to him, but with great presence of mind, he adopted a calm demeanour and evaded the crisis.\u201cYour Highness, when I saw the young lady who was dressed humbly in a dress, certainly not fit for a royal ball, who had her two cheeks full of food, I found her so adorable. She had an indescribable charm that I had never encountered in any other lady. My heart was irrevocably stolen.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s lips twitched slightly. She realized fully well that his words were indirectly mocking her.\u2018If he\u2019s trying to provoke me, he\u2019ll be disappointed. I won\u2019t take to the bait.\u2019Instead, Amethyst laughed, \u201cI often hear that I eat so well. Elders often praise me for it.\u201d\u201cHow adorable that you can\u2019t differentiate between a joke and a praise.\u201d Alexcent raised a brow, and smoothly mocked her.\u201cThey say those alike come together, Alec, you are quite adorable in that sense too.\u201d\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve never acted as such?\u201d\u201cIn my eyes you did.\u201d\u201cI doubt it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m right.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAmethyst glared at the duke, while keeping a frigid smile in place, but he simply shrugged, unperturbed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 \u2013 A Wife\u2019s Duty (2)Belice tilted her head as she observed the two and carried on the conversation. \u201cWell, I suppose a new appearance can be appealing. By the way Duke Skad, I am thinking of promoting Count Lohikin to be the Minister of Finance, what do you think? After all he will be in-laws with the Royal family, so it makes me rather uneasy that he has no official title.\u201d\u201cNo, your majesty! If you promote him for such a reason it will do you no good in the future.\u201d Amethyst spoke up in surprise.Duke Skad looked at Amethyst as though he was surprised by her reply and opened his mouth.\u201cI agree with the Lady on the point.\u201d\u201cHmm is that so. Amethyst, won\u2019t you feel disappointed? It\u2019ll probably be better if the Count is promoted to be the Minister of Finance.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, my father may be involved in political affairs, but he has always said that he has no interest in being a Minister of Finance. So please withdraw your offer.\u201d\u2018Of course, it would be great if her father became the Minister of Finance if she was the real Amethyst.\u2019If her father were to become the Minister of Finance then the attention would be on her as well, then there was a higher chance that her future plan set a year from now, may fail.Amethyst knew too well how the personal details of all kinds of family members were disclosed at the hearing where ministers were appointed, and how not only direct family members but even relatives were exposed to people\u2019s attention.Of course, the Sehar Empire may not hold political hearings or anything, but it was better to be safe than sorry.\u201cThen I\u2019m sure a deputy finance minister should be okay. From what I hear he seems to have many years of experience in the finance department. So let\u2019s conclude as such. Duke Skad, you were right. I like your young lady.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you, Your Majesty.\u201dJust as they were about to move on to a lighter topic of conversation, Karune came over to inform Empress Belice of her next appointment.\u201cGuess we need to call it a day for today. Amethyst, feel free to come by and visit the palace. I have no sisters so I will be happy to have you visit. Duke Skad, you may leave for today.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. I shall not keep you any longer.\u201dAs Belice got up to leave, Amethyst and Duke Skad too got up to bid the empress farewell. Fortunately, Belice didn\u2019t seem to suspect them and accepted their newfound relationship.Amethyst, then, gestured to the duke and stopped him in his tracks. Duke Skad tilted his head questioningly and bent over to lean his face near to Amethyst, as she whispered softly.Amethyst must have sensed that Belice\u2019s attention was focused on her, as she deliberately whispered to his ears shyly with a smile, as though making a confession. The duke seemed surprised at first but must have come to a realization as he mumbled \u2018No wonder she knew immediately whenever I pulled a prank on her when we were young.\u2019 and glanced in Belice\u2019s direction.And before she knew it, the duke\u2019s hands were wrapped around her waist. Belice pretended to not notice their public display of affection and walked on to her office.*At the duke\u2019s mansion, rather than being educated on becoming the wife of the duke, Amethyst was busy preparing for the wedding. The duke had left all the preparation to her as she had said she wanted a grand wedding. In truth, it was more like pushing it towards her. As such, the second secretary of the duke, Lunia presented to assist Amethyst with the preparation.\u201cLunia, so the duke has gone to the palace today as well?\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201d\u201cHmm, I need to choose the dress and there are many things to do. Please wake me up before Duke Skad enters the palace tomorrow. I will take him by the collar if I need to and drag him to go and choose the dress with me.\u201d Amethyst emphasised her words.Lunia flinched as the bride used the words \u201ccollar and drag.\u201d She was amazed by her, who was treating the duke referred to as the \u2018Prince of blood\u2019 so casually. He must truly love her.*Thanks to Lunia, Amethyst was able to get up early in the morning which she used to find difficult. She couldn\u2019t complain as she found the opportunity to catch hold of the duke.Amethyst stopped the duke who was in the midst of preparing to enter the palace.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cToday we need to go and choose the wedding dress. So, I won\u2019t allow you to go to the palace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t need to wear a dress.\u201d He answered her cooly.\u201cWho said that I asked Your Highness to wear it?\u201d The duke refused to acknowledge her, sp she called his attention once more. \u201cAlec.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you really that dumb?\u201d\u201cJer-!\u201d\u2018Jerk!\u2019\u00a0Amethyst forced her mouth to a close. She had to hold back for now. \u201cFine, Alec. Today I need to choose a dress, and I need you there as I choose. So, you can\u2019t go to the palace today.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to be there?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s the duty of the groom.\u201d\u201cAh, the duty of the groom! Are you willing to fulfil your duty as the bride?\u201dAmethyst hesitated at his clever gaze.\u201cWh\u2026what duty?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find out shortly. Fine, let\u2019s go and see your dress. Gen, get ready to leave!\u201dAlexcent turned his head to order Gen, but somehow his assistant seemed more uncomfortable than he did.\u201cBut Your Highness\u2026today we have an important meeting regarding the Boron nation\u2019s sea territorial dispute.O-Ok-kay.\u201dAs Alexcent gave him a frosty glare, Gen agreed reluctantly and disappeared in a hurry to adjust his schedule.These days whenever Alexcent and Amethyst met each other, they would bicker incessantly and growl at each other as if they wanted to bite off each other\u2019s heads.Gen worried and wondered if they would be able to get through the contract smoothly, but at times he also found himself confused by the constant laughter of the duke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 Never Too Late (1)\u201cHow does this dress look?\u201dAlexcent glanced up lazily and said, \u201cHmm\u2026 It\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no good, then. I\u2019ll have to try on the next one.\u201d\u201cHow many are you going to try on? All of them have been fine!\u201d\u201cAll you\u2019ve said is \u2018fine and \u2018not bad\u2019!\u201d said Amethyst. \u201cThat means there\u2019s nothing special about them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the dresses that are the problem-\u201dAmethyst cut Alexcent off, shouting to the madam. \u201cNext! I\u2019ll try on the next one!\u201dThis was Alexcent\u2019s own personal version of hell. He\u2019d never realized what a tedious business it was, picking out clothing. Every dress was practically the same! The cut, colour, and trimmings all blurred into one. He couldn\u2019t understand why she wanted him to choose or what he was supposed to say. \u2018I\u2019ll just say the next one is pretty, no matter what it looks like.\u2019 Then he could escape all this\u2026frippery.That seemed like the perfect idea until Amethyst emerged wearing what was exactly the 27th dress he\u2019d seen that day. He prepared himself to compliment her, tell her it was pretty, but something different came blurting out.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026beautiful,\u201d he said reverently.He gave an awkward cough, surprised at his own effusive praise. Amethyst practically glowed with pleasure at the compliment.\u201cIsn\u2019t it? This one is my favorite too. I knew you\u2019d like it.\u201dThe madam, who had been listening to every word between the two, launched into a description of the gown\u2019s virtues.\u201cAs expected, the young lady has exceptional taste! This is the newest dress. It arrived less than an hour ago while the young lady was going through the collection. Remember I ordered them to bring one more quickly since His Highness is here, hm? Look at these stars! See how they shine? They were embroidered and enchanted into the fabric with the assistance of magicians. The best artisans in the empire created it bead by bead. This isn\u2019t just a dress, it\u2019s a masterpiece!\u201d\u201cWell, when you put it like that,\u201d said Amethyst. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it!\u201d\u201cAs you please. If you could set a date for the alterations, I will wait on you at the duke\u2019s mansion.\u201dAlexcent had all but stopped listening to the conversation, relieved he was free from the endless parade of gowns. He wore a pleased expression as he got up off his seat and prepared to leave. Amethyst grinned at him, gliding over to him and hugging his arm gently to her chest.\u201cNow it\u2019s time to go and look at shoes.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dAmethyst\u2019s laughter echoed off the walls of the luxurious boutique*\u201cDid you have a good trip, sir?\u201d asked Pon, the butler.The duke was sprawled across the sofa with his eyes closed. \u201cIt was hell,\u201d he groaned. \u201cChoosing the damned dress alone took eight hours! Then after that\u2026 Why on Earth am I\u2026\u201dPon listened to the duke\u2019s tirade in patient, polite silence.\u201cThis is why I hate my marriage.\u201d\u201cPardon the interruption, My Lord, but the wedding rings haven\u2019t been forged yet.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexcent lifted his head, then let it drop back to the sofa. \u201cUgh. Damn it. Summon the Jewel Master tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The butler paused, then added, \u201cIt is good to see you enjoying yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d the duke replied curtly.Then he stopped, actually thinking about that for a moment. Perhaps he was enjoying himself. If he really examined his behaviour lately, he was laughing out loud more. He didn\u2019t dislike Amethyst entirely. She was capricious, sulking one moment, shouting the next, then smiling again. At least it wasn\u2019t boring. In fact, he rather enjoyed her company.She was fun to tease, and refreshingly open. She never hid her feelings, always honest and open with her thoughts and opinions.*Amethyst had decided to hold the wedding in the garden of the duke\u2019s mansion. She was deep in conversation with the gardener, discussing the decorations she wanted on the day. Alexcent\u2019s garden was scrupulously manicured, with vast lawns and tall, straight trees that stood in neat rows against the sky. It would be perfect for an outdoor wedding.\u201cI want to be surrounded by blooming wisteria flowers. Like a large flower tunnel with a waterfall of wisteria each side, and with a white lace cloth for the bride and groom to walk along. Like this,\u201d she said, spreading her arms to demonstrate. \u201cIs it possible for wisteria to bloom now?\u201dThe gardener had a rough idea of her intentions. He nodded. \u201cAs long as we have the help of a magician, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll speak to our magician and make the preparations.\u201d He looked thoughtful. \u201cNormally wisteria is purple, but since it\u2019s a wedding, I suppose cream would be more fitting?\u201d\u201cOh my, is that possible?\u201d Amethyst said in delight. \u201cI love that!\u201dShe smiled in satisfaction. The visual reminded her of a scene from teen movie she\u2019d seen once. She was about to begin picking flowers for the centerpieces when Alexcent approached her.\u201cAre you busy? Can you spare a minute?\u201d he asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 Never Too Late (2)Amethyst blinked. \u201cOh my, isn\u2019t this a surprise from Alec who never has any time to spare?\u201dHe ignored her tart reply and instead led her toward the mansion\u2019s west tower by the waist. They climbed the winding stone steps without stopping for a break.\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d Amethyst wheezed. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u2026ha\u2026ha.\u201d\u201cThis is why you need to get more exercise,\u201d Alexcent said. \u201cJust a little further, we\u2019re almost there.\u201dHe felt the telltale prickle of someone staring daggers into his back but chose to ignore it. Led by the touch of a strange man for the first time, Amethyst didn\u2019t contradict Alexcent\u2019s criticism and simply followed his lead.Finally, they reached the top. The clear sky opened up above her as she stepped out, a cool breeze tugging at her hair and clothes. This was the highest point in the mansion. From up here they could look out and take in the entire Sehar Empire in a single glance.\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d she said, rushing to the safety wall to get a better look. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought me up here before? It\u2019s so beautiful! Is that the royal palace? I\u2019d know that architecture anywhere. Wow, look there! There\u2019s a huge lake right in the middle of the city. Can we go and visit it next time?\u201dEven the amazing scenery couldn\u2019t stop her from noticing that Alexcent hadn\u2019t said a word. She turned to look at him, some of the excitement fading from her face. He seemed uncomfortable. Seeing someone usually so upright and outspoken look nervous made her nervous too. When their eyes met, Alexcent cleared his throat. He approached her stiffly, then took her small, delicate hands in his much larger ones.Amethyst held her breath as he brushed his thumb along the backs of each of her fingers. He slid a warm band of metal around the ring finger of her left hand. A pale pink diamond cut into a teardrop, framed by smaller, clear diamonds. An engagement ring.She looked up at him, wide-eyed.Alexcent hesitated, then spoke. \u201cThis may be an arranged marriage between us, but it is still a marriage. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to get married without a proper proposal. You shouldn\u2019t be denied that.\u201dHe took a deep breath, hoping its never too late to do this.\u201cLady Amethyst Lohikin, will you marry me?\u201dAmethyst\u2019s heart raced. This was the first time anyone had ever proposed to her. Even in the other world, she\u2019d never been proposed to. Once she\u2019d reached a suitable age here, the arrangements had been made. Despite her hesitation, there had been no reason to refuse. The elders had decided and agreed on the marriage, which was how she ended up engaged without proposal.But Alexcent was doing his best to make her feel honored and respected for her choice. He wanted to care for her as though she was his chosen bride, not just his arranged one. Her heart ached, but she couldn\u2019t show it. This man really was as dangerous as he appeared.\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cYes. I\u2019m so touched\u2026 This is the first time I\u2019ve ever received such a sweet proposal.\u201d She felt her throat tighten and lowered her head.\u201cI\u2019ll do a better job next time,\u201d he said, then kissed her.Her lips parted with surprise and she felt Alexcent\u2019s tongue slip into her mouth. It had never occurred to her that someone else\u2019s tongue could feel so soft, and she liked the sensation of it sliding, pushing against her own. Her breath stuttered, short, and her mind went blank.Alexcent even sucked. She drew back a fraction to catch her breath for a second, but soon their lips were together again, their tongues intertwined. He sucked roughly on her lips, bruising the pliant flesh. In response, Amethyst found herself wrapping her arms around his neck and accepting his kiss wholeheartedly.*Amethyst was in the drawing room, pondering over the minute details of the wedding plans.\u201cMadam.\u201d\u2018Huh? Madam?\u2019 She lifted her head at the unfamiliar title. Pon, who had been introduced to her as the house butler, stood beside her.\u201cMe?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Pon nodded. \u201cYou will soon be the lady of the house, after all.\u201dWhile that was true, being called \u201cMadam\u201d was something that would take some getting used to. It was like something you would hear in a historical drama or an old folktale. She straightened up.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI came to give you these documents. You must review them and give your approval.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dPon handed her a wad of paper as thick as a dictionary. On closer inspection, there were several stacks of paper in the whole. She glanced from the documents up at the butler, confused.\u201cWhat\u2026is all this?\u201dPon cleared his throat. \u201cThe first is regarding the operational costs and details for the main residence. The second pertains to the operational expenses for the annex. The third, the position and task force budget for you, Madam. The fourth-\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Amethyst cried. \u201cHold on!\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d Pon said crisply.\u201cAre you telling me\u2026\u201d She looked at the enormous stack of paper. \u201cThat all of this is going to be my job?\u201d\u201cYes, these will be your duty to oversee from now on.\u201d\u201cWho did it before me?\u201d\u201cI took care of the main household, while Dajal oversaw the annex. Since the position of lady of the house has been vacant for so long, a new position and work promotion expenses have been set up-\u201dAmethyst threw up her hands to stop him before he could launch into another long explanation. \u201cThen continue like it was before. Pon, you can continue looking after the main household expenses, and Dajal can look after the annex.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 \u2013 The Ever Understanding Butler (1)Pon looked perplexed. \u201cForgive me but, Madam, this is officially the role of the lady of the house\u2026\u201dAmethyst was aware of that, but she would be gone from the mansion in a year. To spend that time cramming all this information into her head and stressing over bills and budgets? No way. But I can\u2019t just be stubborn and refuse to do it\u2026 She had to come up with some sort of excuse.\u201cWell, you see,\u201d she said, \u201cI am still rather new to these affairs. It\u2019s beyond me to take over this role right now. I was hoping\u2026maybe I could learn these tasks over your shoulder for the next couple of years? Then there will be minimal disruption due to the household due a change in leadership. I think a gradual change would be better.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d The butler looked thoughtful, then bowed his head in acquiescence. \u201cThen I will continue to handle these duties for now.\u201dShe breathed a silent sigh of relief. \u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dPon wasn\u2019t finished, however. \u201cThe next order of business, then. These are the maids who will serve you from now on.\u201dHe beckoned toward the doorway. When Amethyst looked up, five maids were arrayed in front of her, awaiting her orders. Oh, dear. She wasn\u2019t comfortable ordering people around yet. She had only just managed to leave Yellie behind at the Count\u2019s estate, and now there were five instead of one! She couldn\u2019t deal with that.\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cEven at the Count\u2019s estate I didn\u2019t have a maid.\u201dThe butler looked perplexed, glancing from her to the maids. \u201cBut Madam, you are going to be the wife of the duke of this empire\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Pon said, insistently. \u201cYou will be the highest ranked noble, above the other noble ladies. Excluding the empress, you have the highest rank among the women of the empire. As such, I will ensure you are well served-\u201d\u201cMr. Pon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam. Please just call me Pon.\u201d\u201cAlright, Pon. It hasn\u2019t been long since I first came to this place, and like I mentioned, I have never had a personal maid before. It makes me uncomfortable to have someone hovering around me all the time. I will call on them as and when I need them.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cPon, if I feel uncomfortable, then aren\u2019t you failing in your duty to look after me?\u201d she asked.He offered her an apologetic bow. \u201cI apologize. I will make sure they are on standby. Please call upon them whenever you need.\u201d\u201cI will. Thank you for looking after me.\u201dThankful that she had averted another crisis, Amethyst began to relax again. As before, it was too soon. Pon had more to come.\u201cPlease, Madam, don\u2019t mention it.\u201d He produced a box, roughly A4 size. \u201cThese are the invites that have been extended to you. I took the liberty of arranging them according to the nobles\u2019 rank.\u201dWow, invites? She leaned close to get a look inside the box. It was full to the brim with invitations. The envelopes were all heavy cream paper and gilt lettering. It would probably take her all day to go through the lot of them.\u201cI\u2019m not even married to the duke yet, and they\u2019re already sending me invitations?\u201d\u201cThe position of the duke\u2019s wife has been vacant until now. I am not surprised there are so many households in a hurry to meet you and become acquainted with the Skad household,\u201d said the butler.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s it\u2026\u201d she said absently.Even without seeing Alexcent in action, she could just imagine how the stuck-up duke would behave to the other nobles. He was the equivalent of a CEO\u2019s son in this world. He wasn\u2019t an easy person to deal with, which must be why the noble families were reaching out to her. She was by far an easier option.This wasn\u2019t good news. It wouldn\u2019t be good for her to have her face widely known. What if people recognize her a year from now? She pushed the box back toward Pon.\u201cPlease decline all of these, and any that are sent to me from now on.\u201d\u201cBut madam\u2026\u201d Pon protested. \u201cSocializing with the other noble ladies is one of the many duties of the duke\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cWell, that may be true, but I am not yet his wife,\u201d Amethyst said. \u201cNor am I ready for many things. I may act carelessly in front of those noble ladies and embarrass the duke\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cYou need not worry about such things,\u201d the butler hastened to reassure her. \u201cSoon you will be a role model for all the noble ladies.\u201d\u2018Ugh, why can\u2019t he read between the lines? How bothersome. Fine, he leaves me with no choice.\u2019\u201cActually,\u201d she said, feigning embarrassment with a hand pressed delicately to her cheek, \u201cI have a serious insecurity about my appearance. I\u2019m afraid to put myself out there.\u201d\u201cOh, please forgive me. I misunderstood your intention. I will of course politely decline all the invitations.Amethyst blinked. \u201cOh? \u2026yes. Th-thank you.\u201dThat had been surprisingly easy to convince him. \u2018Wait\u2026\u2019 Why had he accepted that explanation so quickly? Was there really something wrong with her appearance?\u2018Darn it. Since those were my own words, I can\u2019t take them back.\u2019She felt her mood souring rapidly. She glared at the butler until he took back the documents and hastened out of the drawing room. Pon had just agreed that she was ugly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 \u2013 The Ever Understanding Butler (2)It was a few days before he came looking for her again. He greeted her with a bow of the head.\u201cMadam.\u201dAmethyst was still rankled by how easily he\u2019d been convinced that she was worried about her appearance, so she didn\u2019t honor him with a reply, merely lifting her head. Pon went on as if he hadn\u2019t noticed the quiet snub.\u201cWould you be so kind as to write down the names and households of those you would like to personally invite to the wedding? I will send invitations to them.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cOr you could write it in short form, Madam, if that is more convenient.\u201dHere was a dilemma. The only people she knew in this world were those in the Lohikin household, the Skad family, and Empress Belice. \u2018Who am I supposed to invite?\u2019 The Lohikins would definitely be there already, as would Alexcent, since it was his own wedding. Her only other so-called friend was Empress Belice, who was already attending to represent the Skad household.The only person she could possibly invite was Yellie, but she was a commoner. The invite might not be extended to her. \u2018Hmm\u2026I could invite Lady Maria?\u2019 She had been Amethyst\u2019s friend, before all this. But how could she invite someone whose face she didn\u2019t know? How was she supposed to act like Lady Maria\u2019s friend if she\u2019d never met before? No, it sounded like it was trouble waiting to happen.Her worry clearly reflected on her face. \u201cPon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to give this some more thought. Would it be alright if I tell you later?\u201dHe bowed. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cGood, thank you.\u201dShe let out a long sigh as the butler left. What am I supposed to do? There isn\u2019t a single person I\u2019d like to invite. She looked at the pen Pon had given her, then scrawled a name on a piece of paper.Yellie. Then crossed it out and wrote:Froy.That was the name of her mentor before she had come to the duke\u2019s mansion. Just that name, then her pen stopped. Eventually, she crossed out Froy\u2019s name as well. He was her mentor, but not close enough to invite to her wedding. An invitation to a royal wedding was a lot of pressure, so she had to be careful about who she invited.It was the same back then. She had always taken a long time to consider who and where to draw the line. Her secondary school friends that she contacted maybe once a year? Her college friends that she caught up with on holidays? Or her childhood friend she\u2019d recently got back in touch with? The colleague from work who felt like a best friend but had recently resigned?On the other hand, she remembered feeling taken aback when she\u2019d received a wedding invitation from colleagues whose face she couldn\u2019t even recall.After contemplating it for what felt like hours, Amethyst stood. The piece of paper was blank. There was no way she could think of anyone to invite, so she decided to simply be honest. She went in search of Pon.\u201cMadam,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were looking for me?\u201d\u201cYes, I wanted to give my invitation list.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d The butler looked pleased. \u201cPlease give it to me. Thank you.\u201dPon took the blank sheet of paper. To his credit, he didn\u2019t react, merely giving her a slight bow and leaving calmly.*\u201cDid you get the list from her?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Pon passed the blank list to Duke Alexcent. \u201cThe lady doesn\u2019t seem to have any particular household that she interacts with.Unable to forget the pained expression on Amethyst\u2019s face, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to state aloud that she didn\u2019t seem to have many friends.\u201cIs that what she said?\u201d\u201cNo, sir\u2026but she seemed rather uncomfortable while discussing the guest list. Although that is only my observation.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201dAlexcent picked up his own list of guests. The list was long, as one would expect from a large royal family. After a moment\u2019s pause, he picked up his pen and drew a large cross through the list. He did the same on the next few pages, too. When he handed the list back to Pon, most of the guests had been crossed out.\u201cThis should do. Inform the temple that we will be having a simple wedding.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d*After passing Pon that blank sheet, Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but fret about it. She went in search of the butler. The duke would have an extensive list of guests; she couldn\u2019t just not invite anyone. She was sure Count Lohikin could extend the invite to their distant family members, but even then, it would look paltry compared to Alexcent\u2019s list.\u2018Maybe I should just invite Froy and Yellie too.\u2019She entered the butler\u2019s office, but there was no sign of the man himself. Her gaze fell upon a sheet of paper placed neatly in the middle of Pon\u2019s desk. Curious, she looked closer and realized it was the duke\u2019s guest list, but with hundreds of the names crossed out. She checked the sheets underneath it, and they were crossed out too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 \u2013 Cinderella (1)\u2018What is this? Is he going to invite these people or not?\u2019Pon returned to the office just as she was pondering these questions. \u201cMadam, what brings you all the way down here?\u201dShe startled. \u201cOh. I wanted to reconsider the guest list I gave you earlier.\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201d He removed her blank list from beneath the duke\u2019s and passed it to her.\u201cPon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam?\u201d\u201cIs this other list Alexcent\u2019s?\u201d The butler confirmed that it was. \u201cThen, why is most of it crossed out?\u201d\u201cHis Highness decided not to invite them to the wedding.\u201dAmethyst blinked, surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he inviting them?\u201d\u201cI am not sure, Madam. But if you have anyone else you would like to invite, please feel free to add to them to your guest list.\u201dIf Alexcent wasn\u2019t inviting others, then Amethyst didn\u2019t need to either. She felt the tension unravel from her shoulders and smiled.\u201cOn second thought, I think this will be just fine.\u201dShe passed the blank list back to Pon and strode out of his office.That night, Amethyst lay wide awake in her bed, unable to sleep as thoughts tumbled over each other in her head. \u2018Was he being considerate towards me? No, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019 But in her mind she saw again those thick lines striking the names off his guest list.She tried to forget it and go to sleep, but rest eluded her. Thinking back, even in her old world she\u2019d had trouble sleeping as her wedding approached. There had been many a restless night. Eventually she gave up completely and got up, picking up her gown and leaving the bedroom.The corridor was quiet; everyone else was asleep. Lights lit the corridor at regular intervals. She peered out of each window as she passed. The stars glittered in the night sky, and clouds drifted in front of the moon like a fluttering veil.She stopped. There was a light leaking out of a cracked door. That was the duke\u2019s office.\u2018What is he doing up at this hour?\u2019Perhaps it was just curiosity, or the strange melancholy that hung over her, but she found herself knocking on the door. The reply came a moment later:\u201cCome in.\u201dAmethyst grasped the handle and pushed the door to Alexcent\u2019s office. The duke was at his desk, reading something by the light of a lamp. He didn\u2019t look up as she entered.\u201cWhat are you doing up so late?\u201d she asked.His head jerked up at the sound of a female voice. He raised his eyebrows at Amethyst, having been expecting Pon or some other servant to be bothering him at this hour. Not his future wife.\u201cI could ask the same of you,\u201d he countered.\u201cTaking a walk,\u201d she said.\u201cAt this hour?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d Amethyst sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to fall asleep. I was just walking around and saw that the lights in here were still on.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d The duke gestured to the documents on his desk. \u201cAs you can see.\u201dAs Alexcent replied curtly, Amethyst turned to look around at his surroundings. Every inch of the surface of his desk was covered in documents.\u201cPeople might think you are the only working member of the empire.\u201d\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\u2018Pfft. Seriously this guy. Wouldn\u2019t know sarcasm if it bit him in the face.\u2019Looking around, she realized that before she intruded, Alexcent must have been really busy; he picked up a pen and resumed working on his document, writing something intently.Scribble. Scribble.She found the sound of pen against paper strangely soothing.\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you, I promise. Can I stay here for a little while?\u201dAlexcent looked up at her blankly not saying anything at all.\u201cI just can\u2019t fall asleep. It\u2019s quiet in there\u2026and weirdly enough, I find the sound of you writing so comforting. Please.\u201d\u201cWhat do you-? Oh, Alright. Do as you please.\u201d He sighed and gave in eventually. Amethyst, eagerly took her place on the sofa opposite him.In the silence, only the sound of his pen could be heard as he scribbled and occasionally crossed something out. After quietly listening to it for some time, Amethyst was reminded of something that she wanted desperately to share with him, even at the risk of breaking her promise to not disturb him.\u201cIt\u2019s like Cinderella.\u201d\u201cCin\u2026what?\u201d Alexcent\u2019s hand did not stop, nor did he look up at her, but he still replied.\u2018Yes, Cinderella. Who was fatigued both in body and mind for 11 years.Perhaps it was with the help of a fairy or god she fell into this world, was coincidentally invited to the royal wedding, met a duke and got married to him\u2014a contract marriage.\u2019\u201cMmm\u2026It\u2019s a book that I read when I was young. About a young girl, who lived in suffering for a long time but eventually with the help of a fairy godmother, she manages to go to a Royal ball, where she meets a handsome duke who falls in love with her at first sight. Even as the ball comes to an end, the duke, unable to forget the beautiful Cinderella, turns the entire village upside down in search of her, and eventually finds her and marries her. A typical fairy tale, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 let me get this straight. You are referring to yourself as that Cinderella?\u201d he asked rather quizzically, raising an eyebrow but not looking up from the documents.\u201cWell, don\u2019t you think this is a similar situation?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He declared firmly, finally looking up at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2013 Who Is the Idiot? (1)\u201cWhy not? Aren\u2019t you discarding my theory a little too quickly?\u201d She asked, affronted.\u201cAlright. Well, first of all, you are not Cinderella who lived in suffering. You are a daughter of a noble household. You\u2019ve never known suffering your entire life.\u201d\u201cHow would you know if I have or have not?\u201d\u201cBecause Count Lohikin isn\u2019t that poor, nor is he someone who would make his own daughter face hardships while under his roof.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026that is true.\u201d She admitted fairly.\u201cAnd more importantly, I don\u2019t think the handsome duke fell in love with you at first sight.\u201d\u201cWhat? Alec!\u201dEmeslis stood up from at his words, indignant. He suppressed a grin, teasing her, like he did at times. Never to an extent to cause serious offense.\u2018More like a primary school kid, that teases the girl he likes, maybe? The girl he likes\u2026of course that doesn\u2019t apply between us.\u2019\u201cNo matter what you say, I quite like my face. I\u2019m fond of it, the way it is.\u201d\u201cWell, that is some confidence.\u201dShe puffed up her cheeks in annoyance and glared at him, to which he smiled.Still grinning playfully, Alexcent got up from his seat. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Go back and sleep.\u201d\u201cYeah, I was just about to go.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll escort you.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll escort you back to your room.\u201dWide-eyed, Amethyst stared at him in amazement, her heart fluttering a little at this very gentlemanly gesture of his. .\u201cIt\u2019s not that far. I can go back on my own.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dark in the night. Just in case.\u201dUnlike the previously casual tone of his voice, he spoke so gravely and rationally that Amethyst found herself nodding in agreement.They walked side by side along the empty corridors.\u2018Was his offering to escort her back a way of making it up to her for his teasing?\u2019Amethyst tilted her head slightly to look at him properly. \u2018They say all men are simple, but that doesn\u2019t seem to apply to this man. He was complicated, hard to decipher and always left her feeling confused and unsure of her own heart.\u2019He matched her stride and walked looking straight ahead, his posture erect, his gait befitting the graceful one of an aristocrat.The silent corridor echoed with the sound of their synchronized footsteps.She suddenly sensed movement in a corner.\u2018To think that there were people at this hour of the night. Was this what he meant before, by just in case?\u2019Startled, Amethyst found herself sticking close to Alexcent and grabbing hold of his hand. He seemed surprised by her sudden action and looked down at her enquiringly.Amethyst laughed awkwardly, thinking of an excuse to cover her faux pas. \u201cThat is-\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, she spotted maids who had ended their shift, walking towards them from the other end of the corridor.\u201cWell, you know. People think we are getting married for love. So, I just thought we should look more affectionate to others, you know. More believable and\u2026 realistic.\u201dShe bluffed, feeling like he would tease her if she confessed that she had been scared. She didn\u2019t want to give him any more reasons to make fun of her.\u201cWell, that is true.\u201d He admitted graciously.As the two maids passed the couple, they politely bowed their heads in greeting and looked at each other with eyes that screamed of impending gossip. Alexcent greeted them back with a brief nod, and even as the maids disappeared round the corner, did not let go of her hand and headed towards the bedroom.The act of holding hands made her feel close to him.She felt a tingling sensation at their joined palms and along her spine. Feeling lightheaded, she smiled to herself.\u2018I wonder if he feels the same way. The electricity between us?\u2019Amethyst, mentally shook her head and firmly instructed herself to get a grip on her strangely scattering feelings. \u2018Of course not!\u2019Upon reaching her bedroom door, neither of them let go of the other\u2019s hand and stared at the other in silence. Amethyst ventured to loosen her grip but his hold around her hand was still strong.\u201cAlec? You need to let my hand go-\u201dOnly then did Alexcent seem to realise that their hands were still joined and he immediately loosened his grip.Their hands had finally parted but now the situation seemed more sensual.\u2018Like. This was like\u2026 A boyfriend sending you back home after a date! Then afterwards\u2026\u2019Leaning against the bedroom door, she looked up at him. She gulped as his intense gaze fell on hers.Click.Emesis lifted her hand and opened the door behind her.\u201cGood night, Alec.\u201dShe quickly went inside and closed the door.\u2018Anyone can hold hands. You hold hands with a friend, or even an acquaintance. It wasn\u2019t a big deal holding his hand. But it was the furthest she should go with this man\u2019.She enveloped her flaming cheeks with her two cold hands and collapsed onto her bed.She had been thinking of the kiss that day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2013 Who Is the Idiot? (2)After another ordinary day, she had finished her daily tasks and had headed to bed, but yet again, Amethyst found herself unable to fall asleep. She started to feel worried as the wedding approached. She wondered if she had made the right choice, and whether this was the best choice for the future.She had judged that it would be easier to spend her time in the duke\u2019s estate, where, unlike the Count\u2019s estate, nobody knew her. But she couldn\u2019t shake off a nagging feeling.Finally, she had started addressing herself as Amethyst. She called herself Amethyst but hadn\u2019t forgotten who she really was. Perhaps that was why she found it hard to sleep.Then suddenly, she was reminded of Alexcent. She wondered if he was working late tonight as well. She got out of bed, put on her dressing gown and went out into the darkness.Just like the day before, light leaked out through the door.Knock knock.After knocking once, she opened the door before she could hear a reply.Alexcent was seated behind his desk surrounded by piles of documents, but something must have not been going well as a deep frown marred his usually mischievous expression.\u201cBusy?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but feel a little annoyed that he didn\u2019t even look up at her when he replied.\u201cEven then, surely you can spare a moment to look at me when you speak to me!\u201d\u201cAhhh. Of course.\u201dHe looked up and met her gaze briefly before returning to his documents.\u2018He really must be busy. There was no choice; if it was something urgent then it was understandable to her.Back at work she had times where she would be so focused on something that she lost all sense of time. Any unwanted interruption got on her nerves.\u2019Amethyst sighed and sat on the sofa opposite him. She suddenly spoke, \u201cDo you know the story about the village idiot Ondal and Princess Pyeonggang?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going on about? Pyeonggang what?\u201dEven though he responded that way, he still paid attention and interacted with her.\u201cLong long ago, there lived a Princess named Pyeonggang. Every time she cried, her father, the king of the country, told her he would make her marry the village idiot Ondal, if she didn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe studied his impassive reaction before continuing on.\u201cAnyway, Princess Pyeonggang one day, threw a tantrum and said that she wanted to marry the village idiot, to which the king replied and said that she couldn\u2019t as he was an idiot. But the princess insisted so, the angry king threw her out of the castle.The banished princess goes on to find idiot Ondal and marries him. Then she teaches him martial arts, makes him study and turns him into a general. The village idiot Ondal no longer is an idiot and later becomes the General Ondal.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026in summary, are you saying I am the village idiot Ondal and you are Princess Pyeonggang?\u201d He asked innocently.\u201cI never said that.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t, per se. However, it\u2019s exactly what you meant.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYes. You placed an awful lot of emphasis on the word idiot.\u201d His lips twitched, betraying both his knowledge and amusement.\u2018This man isn\u2019t as slow as I thought.\u2019Amethyst just shrugged, in her defence.\u201cThat story is wrong.\u201d He suddenly remarked.\u201cWrong?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s more like Prince Ondal and the idiot princess.\u201d\u201cHa? Are you calling me an idiot?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI think you are?\u201d\u201cI doubt it.\u201dAs expected, It was impossible to win with words. Amethyst gave up and was about to lean against the sofa, when there was a knock and a voice heard behind the door.\u201cYour highness, It\u2019s Gen.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe assistant who had come in through the door in the late night, seemed surprised to find Amethyst inside.\u201cI have something to report-\u201d\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d Amethyst stood up, and was about to leave, when Alec got up as well.\u201cYou wait here. I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh no, I\u2019m fine. You should get back to your work.\u201dAlexcent looked at Gen, to which Gen quickly replied. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing urgent. I\u2019ll wait right here.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAlexcent left Gen in his office and left along with Amethyst.*\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to-\u201d Amethyst trailed off and couldn\u2019t help but glow with joy on the inside, at Alexcent\u2019s consideration for her.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to hold it today?\u201d\u201cSorry? Hold what?\u201d She saw him subtly offer his hand.\u2018Ahhh. He wants to hold hands like yesterday, does he?\u2019\u201cWell there\u2019s nobody passing by today so there\u2019s no reason to.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u2018Why does he suddenly look gloomy?\u2019All along, as they walked along the corridor, he seemed expressionless. But it seemed like someone was upset about something.*\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Alexcent asked Gen in a low unenthusiastic tone as he returned to his office.\u201cYour highness, I just received a message from the Alst. Apparently Celeos from the Pontifex has repaid his principal as well as the interest.\u201d\u201cPaid back the money?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden? How? With what kind of money?\u201d\u201cAfter some digging, I found out that the empress had recently donated a large amount of money to the pontifex.\u201d\u201cBelice?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 \u2013 Split in Half (1)\u201cYes. It seems like the donation was made by Empress Belice. It is quite a great amount.\u201d\u201cHa, Belice? Huh\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAlexcent, momentarily lost deep in thought, spoke after a whole minute.\u201cWhat about the thing I asked you to look into, before?\u2019\u201cAh, Yes. I received a message from Kairan that all preparations are complete.\u201d\u201cYou told them to increase the scale, yes?\u201d\u201cYes. They reported back that all is going well with no hiccups so far.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s good. Send a platinum invitation to Celeos too.\u201d\u201cI will. But the question is, will he attend? I mean, now that he has no debt.\u201d\u201cPrecisely why he will.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cNow that he has no debt, he will rush into it even more. That\u2019s the nature of gambling.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\u201cTomorrow, I must have an audience with the empress.\u201d\u201cI will schedule it accordingly.\u201dAs Gen left the office, Alexcent fell into a deep thought.\u2018Belice\u2026Why are you suddenly behaving this way?\u2019*As soon as the sun was up, Alexcent quickly prepared to visit Belice at the Royal Palace. The moment he arrived, he asked for Belice almost frenetically. She finally emerged, both surprised and annoyed by her brother\u2019s frenzied manner.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you looking for me so early in the morning?\u201dShe asked, glaring at Alec over the breakfast table as she drank her tea, but Alexcent simply acted indifferently.\u201cWhat do you mean, early? The sun is already high up in the sky.\u201cOnly to you.\u201d\u201cWell then, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s because I missed you.\u201dBelice half-laughed, mockingly. Her incredulity evident in the twist of her mouth as she set her teacup down on the table with a thud.\u201cI doubt it.\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s your will to believe it or not.\u201d\u201cSave the tricks and charm for your fianc\u00e9 Amethyst. So, what is it about?\u201d\u201cThe temple\u2026\u201dAt the mention of the temple Belice tensed up slightly, but quickly trained her expression into a nonchalant one.\u201cI hear you made a donation.\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, why?\u201d\u201cYou would just donate such a large amount, out of the blue?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBelice.\u201dBelice let out a sigh at the familiar admonitory tone of his voice. \u201cI simply donated it so that they would bless your marriage.\u201d\u201cBless?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s not such a big deal for a sister to donate to the temple wishing for the happiness and blessing of a newly married couple.\u201d\u201cIs that really all there is to it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAlexcent studied Belice suspiciously and she utilized his pause to steer the conversation to a different subject.\u201cThen since we are on the topic, let me ask you a question. Why have you not sent out the invitations yet? A lot of people are feeling upset about it.\u201dAs the topic moved on to the wedding invitations, Alexcent adopted a rather irascible demeanour.\u201cWhat is there to be upset about?\u201dBelice stared at him in amazement.\u201cAlexcent, you are the duke and head of the Skad household. Therefore, who do you think will dare to cross the gates of your mansion to your wedding without an invitation? Not only the Lohikin household, but the other noble families seem to be at a loss for what to do. I hope you understand that it is basic manners to send out the invites in a timely manner.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t intend to send out the invites.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you\u2026trying to omit the wedding to your marriage? You may be a workaholic but isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d\u201cI am going to have the full wedding. But we are only inviting direct families. If they really want to come, tell them to come for the after party. I won\u2019t stop them.\u201dBelice seemed to be lost in thought before asking.\u201cIs this for Lady Lohikin\u2026.?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAs he denied it immediately, Belice smiled mischievously. \u201cI think I\u2019m right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cUhuh, let\u2019s say I\u2019m wrong then. But that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cWell, I thought I had forced you into marrying just any young lady\u2026but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d\u201cI told you it\u2019s not!\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what you are denying this time.\u201dAlexcent frowned in confusion at Belice\u2019s knowing smirk.*\u201cMadam, may I request your time?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course. The only thing I have, is time on my hands.\u201d Amethyst replied jocularly to Pon who had asked her politely.\u201cThe renovation for your bedroom has been completed. Would you like to take a look?\u201d\u201cBedroom? I was under the impression that I would be staying here.\u201d\u201cThat is out of the question. The room you are currently using is a guest room for visiting nobles. We cannot have you stay in such a room.\u201d\u201cAh. I see.\u201dShe had thought this room was fabulous. Feeling a bit nostalgic, but also excited, Amethyst swiftly made her way towards her new room.She followed Pon right to the centre of the estate, where it overlooked the beautiful scenery of the garden in one glance. The centre of the centre. It felt like it represented the heart of the duke.\u201cThis is the room that the two of you will be using. If there is anything not to your liking, or lacking, please let me know. We will fix it accordingly.\u201d\u2018Wait. Two of us?\u2019 Amethyst stopped herself from gazing around the room and turned to look at Pon in surprise.\u201cWhat do you mean, the two of us?\u201dWondering if he\u2019d overstepped a boundary, Pon ventured, \u201cPardon? Well, when you become a married couple then it\u2019s only right that you used one bedroom-\u201dHe coughed and trailed off, unable to finish his sentence.\u2018Being a married couple meant sharing one\u2019s personal life. So, he must have meant that it was right to share a room. It came along with a reception area and bathroom, offices for the both of them, a dress room and an enormous bed large enough to fit four people.\u2019Amethyst who had been looking around cried out, in panic, \u201cLet\u2019s split it in half?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Split in Half (2)\u201cPardon madam?\u201d Pon looked at her like she had grown two heads.\u201cAll of it. The bed, personal space, dressing room and even the bathroom. Please split in in half.\u201d\u201cWhy-?\u201dPon seemed taken aback by the unexpected request and asked.\u2018Why? Well that\u2019s because we are in a contract marriage.\u2019 Amethyst couldn\u2019t bring herself to explain so simply replied briefly.\u201cThis has already been agreed with Alec-. No, the duke. I don\u2019t need to explain why.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026I see. Then how shall I split it in half?\u201d Pon asked in a depressed tone as his hard work was requested to be split.\u201cWhere did the duke sleep before?\u201d\u201cHe used his own personal bedroom across the hall.\u201d\u201cAll this while?\u201d\u201cYes. He prioritizes efficiency.\u201d\u201cWell, then the duke will continue using that room. I will use this room except the duke\u2019s personal space. Since I need the bathroom, reception area and dressing room.\u201cUh. Yes.\u201dPon wondered briefly if the lady was a gold-digger as he accepted her command.*That evening. As any other day, Pon greeted Alexcent who had just returned from the palace.\u201cWelcome back, sir.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI have something to inform you\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI informed Madam that the renovation for the bedroom had been completed.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s finished earlier than expected.\u201d\u201cYes. Well, she wishes to use it alone and says it had already been discussed and agreed with you.\u201d\u201cHmm? Alone?\u201d He tilted his head momentarily, then seemed to remember something and replied dryly. \u201cAhhh, yes alright. Do as she wants. I will just stay in my previous room.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dPon was about to leave and not disturb Alexcent any further.\u201cBy the way, Pon.\u201d\u201cSo Ahem\u2026 late in the night\u2026\u201dPon wondered what his master was about to say and being so hesitant about it. Suddenly he felt afraid and tensed as he replied.\u201cYes sir, please go ahead.\u201d\u201cCan you make the maids guard around my office corridor?\u201d\u201cSorry?! But there are already the shadows that guard the mansion? Is something troubling you?\u201d\u201cNo but-. Just do as I say.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. But it will be too hard for one to do all night, so I will place them on rotation to guard the corridor.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make it too obvious, just make sure they act naturally.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dPreviously he had asked for all the remaining maids to be removed as their presence disturbed him, but Pon supposed with the new addition to the family, it was good that he was making sure he covered all grounds. Since it was only right for the employees to serve the master of the house, Pon made arrangements as such.*\u2018Perhaps it was due to the late night talks with Alec. Or was it the rapidly approaching wedding?\u2019Amethyst walked around her bed, unable to lie down. She crossed her arm and rubbed her arm. She felt anxious.Today after seeing the couple bedroom, her future of a married life felt imminent and real. Earlier, it had simply felt like a hypothetical situation. Something that was happening to another person. She couldn\u2019t sleep from the nervousness and anxiety.At times like this, she couldn\u2019t help but think of him.\u2018Yes, when I\u2019m with him I feel at ease. I don\u2019t feel anxious or nervous when I am bickering with him, in fact I don\u2019t think of anything else.\u2019As her train of thoughts eventually came to an inconclusive end, Amethyst opened her bedroom door and made her way down.Knock knock.She entered the room as she knocked. But to her surprise and disappointment, his seat was empty.\u2018He must have gone off for a while seeing how the lights were still on. What should I do? Should I go back?\u2019Unlike her thoughts, she found herself lingering on. As she contemplated what to do next, he opened the door and came in.He must have taken a shower; unlike his usual self, his neatly combed hair was wet and tangled, and he had a gown on top of his unbuttoned shirt.The droplets at the end of his hair shined along with his platinum hair.\u201cI see you haven\u2019t fallen asleep yet.\u201d\u201cI thought you would be busy today\u2026\u201dSeeing a new side to him made her trail off.\u201cAhh, I got sweaty today. So what story are you here to tell me today?\u201d\u201cStory?\u201d\u201cYes, you always distracted me with a story.\u201d\u201cNot today. I just\u2026.Pon showed me the new bedroom today, and I said I would use it on my own\u2026so I was going to tell you to continue using your current one\u2026.\u201dAmethyst stumbled on her words and made up an excuse.\u201cAlright. I get it.\u201d\u201cAre you going to work late today as well?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to rest early today.\u201dAmethyst simply stared at him blankly not sure of what to say. He too didn\u2019t avoid her gaze.Thump-Thump.Unlike her consciousness, her heart thumped loudly.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll walk you back.\u201d Alexcent broke the silence. Amethyst simply nodded in reply.As they left the office, Alexcent grabbed a hold of Amethyst\u2019s hand. She looked up at him, taken aback by his sudden action, to which Alexcent replied by pointing in front with his chin. She saw two maids walking towards them from the other end of the corridor.\u2018Oh. It\u2019s because of the maids.\u2019Somehow because he held her hand. All the anxiety she had felt before seemed to disappear. She let out a sigh of relief.Even after the maids disappeared, Amethyst did not let go of his hand. Just like that the two of them walked hand in hand along the corridor in silence.Like two lovers who didn\u2019t want to say goodbye as they reached the end of the road, they stared at the door of her bedroom for a while. As if they didn\u2019t want this night to end.Thump- ThumpHer heart beat fiercely. And the hands that had been holding hers loosened its grip and wrapped her cheeks. Her eyes met the clear and intense eyes that seemed to be burning. And it was coming nearer towards her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 \u2013 The Big Day (1)Slowly, he leaned down and gently pressed his lips to hers, water dripped down his hair and onto her forehead. She raised her hand to run it through his damp hair, brushing it back from his face, and drawing him closer. As the kiss deepened, they both let out a moan.His arm supported them against the door, as he pushed her against it. Even as he breathed heavily, he didn\u2019t let her go, pulling her even closer than before. His mind was filled with thoughts of them entwined for the whole night.At the sound of the approaching footsteps, he reluctantly broke off their kiss but couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from her. Amethyst was breathing heavily, her cheeks flushed a deep red. He observed as the lust-induced haze lifted from her eyes, replaced by a cold glint. Without as much as a \u2018good night,\u2019 she turned around and disappeared into her room.She was running away embarrassed by a mere kiss. Was she na\u00efve or acting na\u00efve? There was no doubt she was attractive.His eyes shone with a mischievous glint, a satisfied smile graced his lips as Alexcent left for his own bedroom.*As soon as she entered her room, Amethyst hurriedly shut the door and leaned against it. Her heart was pounding like crazy, her breathing shallow.\u2018What was that?!\u2019She had tried to be careful, but he was relentlessly charming and so damn attractive. He was like a spider\u2019s web; the more you tried to get out, the more you got stuck. She fanned her flushed cheeks with her hands and tried to calm her throbbing heart.He was a man that enchanted people, a man she mustn\u2019t let herself fall.*Regardless of Amethyst\u2019s growing anxiety, her wedding day had arrived. Why didn\u2019t the earth just stop moving till she prepared herself?Since the early hours of the morning, she had started getting ready for the big day with the help of the maids. She looked at her reflection and couldn\u2019t believe it was actually her. She did look like a prince\u2019s bride.The clothes might have played an important role in that, she told herself.She wore the dress that she had picked with Alexcent and a long veil that covered her face. Due to her obstructed vision, she was assisted by her maids to enter the garden that was decorated for the wedding.It was a perfect wedding.Everything was just as she had dreamed of, like a scene from a movie. As she had wished, wisteria trees formed a tunnel for her to walk through, and the lilac petals showered down every time the wind blew, making it a spectacle to see. Bouquets of pastel hydrangeas on every table made it even more glamorous.Alexcent wore a black suit that usually made him appear cold and difficult for anyone to approach. But today, when she saw him at the venue, he just looked handsome and gentlemanly. It was probably because he was smiling at her. His black suit highlighted his platinum hair. His scarlet eyes held determination and resolve, which was more than she could say for herself because she was shaking in her boots.\u2018Why am I so nervous? It\u2019s not even my first wedding, or even a real wedding.\u2019Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful that her veil was covering her face. Otherwise, her flushed and tense face would have been exposed.\u201cLook at you! You do look as beautiful as Cinderella, or better yet as Princess Pyeonggang.\u201d\u201cAlec!\u201d She whisper-shouted at him for his teasing. Even on a day like this, he was teasing her. But thankfully it had helped to calm down.Alexcent suppressed a laugh and offered her his hand, which she gladly accepted.The two started walking towards the temple where their marriage would be blessed. To their left were Empress Belice and Duke Roden, and to the right was her family. Besides them, only a few close relatives of the Lohikins were present, making the wedding hall appear spacious. Many noble families and relatives of the Skad Household were waiting in a separately arranged estate for the after-party to celebrate the new couple.As per Amethyst\u2019s standards, it was a grand wedding, but as per Alexcent\u2019s it was a small wedding. Despite the many weeks of preparation and hard work, the ceremony quickly came to an end. The priest officiated the marriage vows, and they recited the marriage vows kneeling, then signed their names on the marriage document. Finally, Alexcent lifted her veil and kissed her chastely.With that, the wedding came to an end. For Alexcent, who hated long boring weddings, it was a relief.Up next was the after-party. All eyes were focused on the newly wedded bride and groom. The highlight of the party was, of course, the dance led by the couple. Everyone who had been invited was unable to hide their excitement. They would finally be able to see the famous Prince Skad and his dancing skills. Even he would not be able to avoid dancing with his new bride.On the other hand, Amethyst was tense for the very reason. She pulled his sleeve and whispered quietly.\u201cAlexcent, I-\u201d She cleared her throat to control the tremor in her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to dance. What should we do? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll ruin everything.\u201dShe looked like she was about to cry. Alexcent kissed her on her cheeks and whispered back to her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. All you have to do is look into my eyes and follow my lead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 \u2013 The Big Day (2) | 19When it was time, Alexcent took Amethyst\u2019s hand and led her to the center of the hall. The loud crowd died down, all eyes were on the newly wedded couple.Getting down on one knee, Alexcent raised the hem of her dress. She was shocked by his sudden move, but he smoothly grabbed a hold of her leg and used the other hand to take off her heels. Since they had quite a difference in height, Amethyst had chosen to wear very high and uncomfortable heels. Her two small feet were visible momentarily before being hidden by her dress again. He stood back up and lifted her a bit and gently placed her feet atop his shoes. Then their stacked feet started to dance along to the song.First step, second step, turn, and repeat.Amethyst no longer had to worry about taking the wrong step or stepping on Alexcent\u2019s feet. She simply looked up into his eyes and followed his lead, just like he had told her to. In the large hall, her shoes were neatly placed to the side just like Cinderella\u2019s glass ones.Her eyes were full of happiness and her heart fluttered around like a butterfly within. The two continued to dance across the dance floor. Whenever Alexcent lifted her up in his arms and twirled her around, her dress flowed and looked like an entire galaxy of stars. Her bright laughter filled the hall. Awed by the scene, spectators sent waves of applause their way. It was a beautiful day, as bright and glorious as her dress of flowing stars.*Even though it was late in the night, the mansion was brightly illuminated by the lights of the party. Those lights lit up the bedroom as well. Outside it was still loud and boisterous but Amethyst\u2019s bedroom was full of silence.As the party reached its peak, Amethyst was escorted to her chamber by her maids. To be more exact, to the bedroom that was now to be used by her alone. The polite maids led her to the bathroom and told her they would be helping her to get ready.A sweet scent filled her nose. Inside the gold bathtub, various flowers were afloat. The maids came towards her and helped her remove the tiara and veil from her head. Then helped her out of her wedding dress, as well as the corset and undergarments she wore. Then Amethyst slipped herself into the bath, it was the perfect temperature, full of flowers that softened her skin, and scents that helped calm her down. It was the second time today that she had taken such a bath. Once in the morning and now.\u2018Was the life of the prince\u2019s wife this indulgent at all times?\u2019Then it occurred to her that all this might be to prepare her for the first night, making her flush.Oh my god! No, I\u2019m sure he will just drop by for a while before going back. I\u2019m sure \u2026 Will he? Yes, he definitely wouldn\u2019t stay.Convinced by her own conclusion, Amethyst put on a thin slip dress to sleep in, wrapped a gown around before entering the bedroom. She froze when she came face to face with Alec who was also in his bathing gown. He must have just gotten out of the shower too as his wet hair glistened in the moonlight.Alexcent was the first to break the silence as he approached her in large strides.\u201cSince you said you can\u2019t be satisfied with just one man, I\u2019ll do my best tonight.\u201d*\u201cWhat are you \u2026 mmmm!\u201dJust as he reached her, Alexcent bent over and kissed her suddenly. He nibbled on her lower lip lightly making her gasp. As her lips partially parted, he used the opportunity to slip his t0ngue in and lick the inside. As warmth engulfed her senses and a sweet sensation entangled her, she let out a soft moan only to be kissed more intently.Her knees buckled, Amethyst gave in completely and without a hitch. She relaxed, her mind turned hazy and she was unable to think any further. His fervent kiss drove away her last shreds of resolve and reason.As she reacted to his intense kiss, his lips descended her neck and collar. She moaned and took a sharp intake of breath as she felt her body shiver when his tongue licked her skin. He was getting more excited by the sight of her soft, bare skin covered by a thin slip dress.But even that frail grab was seen as an obstacle by the prince who was plunging deeper and deeper into the sea of pleasure. He ripped the dress off her just as she came up for air.Before she could even take a mouthful of air, she sucked back in hard. His lips captured her one erect bud on her small mounds, his hands groping them.\u201cHmmm. Ah\u2026mmm.\u201dYet another m0an escaped her, as he turned his attention to her left one. His tongue lapped, touch desperate and he greedily devoured it. When the nibbling teeth took a sharp bite of her n!pple, an unbridled pleasure washed over her. An indescribable sensation settled in the pit of her stomach, spreading throughout her body like wildfire.Alexcent took his time to tease her, every once in a while even eliciting a scream. Wracked by pleasure, she found herself falling deeper and deeper. His tongue explored her [email\u00a0protected] , while his large hand slid down to her thigh. With only her panties in between them, his hands started to rove over it.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026ah\u2026ha.\u201dWith each rub, she breathed more heavily. She felt embarrassed but found herself lifting up her hips as she continued to enjoy the sensation. Soon her last piece of clothing bid her adieu, leaving her entirely bare.Then \u2026 his long, thick finger entered her depths.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 \u2013 A First (1) | 19His long and thick finger penetrated her.\u201cAh! Tha-\u201dAmethyst flushed scarlet as she felt his presence inside of her and found herself instinctively tightening the muscles of her inner thighs. He leaned down, surveyed the delirious look in her eyes, and whispered in her ear with a sly smile.\u201cHow wanton of you to react like that already.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not-! Ah\u2026like that-\u201d\u2018How could he call me a wanton when I\u2019ve lived like a saint all my life! This is my absolute first time, after all! If I derive any pleasure out of it, I\u2019m rightly entitled to it.\u2019She had never experienced this before. Neither in this life nor in her previous one. The kind of relationship she was accustomed to, involved minimal physical exchanges that were nothing but brief. Even those were a rarity once the children were born.However, she had never once complained.She had every intention of avoiding contact with the relationship that had given her nothing but heartache and hurt. For that reason, she often pretended to be deep asleep when he returned and alternatively would sleep with the kids often.However, right then, it felt nothing like that.Everything in her was alive and aware for the first time, and she didn\u2019t think she had much chance against his guileless love. The sweet and genuine kisses, and physical interaction of the loving kind, was a new experience for her.She closed her two eyes, soaking in the blissful sensations as her face turned pink with pleasure.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re thinking about something else right now. I better try harder.\u201dHis finger reached even deeper and moved roughly inside her, causing a warm fluid to flow down her inner thigh.Mortified, she covered her flushed face with her hands. His lips centred at her [email\u00a0protected] , paused mid-action. He pushed himself up and spread her thighs apart with his large hands.\u201cDon\u2019t look. It\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201dAs Amethyst stuttered in embarrassment, Alexcent placed his lips on her inner thigh and licked at the warm fluid.\u201cHa\u2026hmm\u2026oh please.\u201d She moaned in pleasure, her words slowly drawled out and her voice loud.\u2018Ah, this is driving me crazy\u2026I feel like I am going to explode.\u2019As his breath tickled her thighs, he felt like it was burning her up. She wriggled her toes in exhilaration.Amethyst, unable to bear it any longer, lifted the hand covering her face, and gripped the bed sheet, trembling in pleasure. Subconsciously, she matched the pace of his breathing.\u201cHa\u2026.so sweet. It\u2019s like a drug, driving me crazy.\u201dHe lifted his head and smiled, discarding the gown he had been wearing, on to the floor.Oh my god.His wide shoulders and prominent collar bone. The toned muscles forming his tight ab, and\u2026Amethyst, unable to tear her eyes away from Alexcent\u2019s [email\u00a0protected] body, caught herself and lowered her gaze in surprise.\u201cAlec, wait\u2026.\u201dFeeling almost dizzy with nervousness, she tried to avoid the unavoidable. He, however, was far too excited to even consider slowing down, and showed no mercy. He took hold of her ankles and pulled her in towards him, immediately inserting himself deeply inside her.He was way too impatient to give her a chance to reject him. He let out a loud m0an as he felt himself engulfed by warm heat and its fluid.Amethyst felt like she had been struck by lightning as she felt him moving inside of her, and felt a strong wave of pain. She cried out as she felt her skin being torn.\u201cPlease, it hurts\u2026.stop\u201d She begged as she almost sobbed.This isn\u2019t my first time, but for Amethyst\u2019s body, it was different. Oh no! I can no longer distinguish who I mean by myself anymore.Alexcent, intoxicated by her sweet floral scent, came to a halt as he smelled blood in the air and looked down at her in surprise.\u201cWait\u2026.was this your first time?!\u201dShe looked up at him with tears in her eyes. Alexcent swore under his breath, before lifting her up and placing her on top of his thighs. He kissed her softly and hugged her as he patted her back soothingly.Slowly her sobbing died down.\u201cI am sorry. Are you alright now?\u201dAmethyst nodded with flushed cheeks, unable to look into his eyes. She was embraced by him for a long time; she sensed that he didn\u2019t seem to have any plans of letting her go.As soon as she calmed down, he immediately tried to touch her again. Alexcent carefully lay her back on the bed, and very slowly felt her deeply again.This time, it was soft and gentle with no hints of roughness like the previous time.He carefully scrutinised every expression of hers as he continued. He kissed her briefly on her lips to reassure her. As he slowly and gently carried on, her pain quickly changed to pleasure and she found herself m0aning out loud.\u201cHmmm. Ahhh, ahhh.\u201dHe entered her deeply and started to move his hips slowly against hers. Her m0ans matched the pace of his movement.His large hands pinched her n!pples, and his lips traced every inch of skin on her body. Their sweat covered bodies collided with each other as l3wd sounds echoed in the entire bedroom.A short while later, succumbing to her pleasure and reaching her climax, Amethyst let out a cry and let herself go, as Alec too let go and lay on top of her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 \u2013 A First (2) | 19The bedroom was filled with silence, the only audible sound was of their rough breathing. Alexcent kissed her tenderly on her forehead, and then turning her body over, made her lay on her front.Amethyst opened her eyes wide and looked at him before speaking, her voice hoarse with longing. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? You don\u2019t expect me to be satisfied by just once, do you? No way, it\u2019s our first night together,\u201dAlexcent smirked and kissed her back. She started to tremble. His lips traced her spine to her ass and licked downwards. She shuddered as her senses were heightened once more.Alexcent laughed as he opened up her thighs.Once they had reached the early hours of the next day, Alexcent finally allowed her to rest in his arms.More accurately, she had passed out in his arms.*By the time she opened her eyes, it was already past noon.\u201cAh\u2026.ouch!\u201d She tried to get up but her whole body ached. All over, it felt like her body was screaming at her not to get up. As though having awaited her cries, a maid immediately knocked at the door and asked.\u201cMadam, should I prepare the bath?\u201d They seemed to know exactly what a new bride needed after her first night.\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cWe will come and escort you once it is ready.\u201dShe didn\u2019t have to wait for long. Soon the maids came to fetch her, and Amethyst followed them to the adjoined bathroom and into the bath. She felt much better as she dipped herself in the hot bath. Then one of the maids relayed the message from the Prince.\u201cHe said you would be tired once you wake up and told us to serve you to the best of our abilities. He wanted us to inform you that he has gone to the palace to catch up on work that he had put off due to the wedding.\u201dWork that he had put off due to the wedding? What a lie. I did all the preparation for the wedding. And working all those late hours in his study wasn\u2019t enough? I can\u2019t barely lift a finger and yet he can already get to work. I don\u2019t know if he just has good stamina or is a complete workaholic.As she dipped herself in warm water, she felt her muscle ache easing away.Then she saw the red love bites all over her body. She had only read about these\u2026but to see them in real life was a very new experience.So, it was real. These kinds of marks. I thought it was just a phrase.Then it accidentally triggered the thoughts from the night before. For some reason, even though it wasn\u2019t, yesterday felt like her first time. Every moment she shared with him last night felt like a dream. It was ecstasy she had never experienced before. It was hard to resist him, when he hugged her gently, as though he truly loved her.Ha. No. Let\u2019s not think about it.She shook her head and tried to drive away her thoughts.But.What if the original owner of this body, Amethyst returns?She felt guilty as she hadn\u2019t been able to fight away her desires. \u00a0Weighed down by her guilt, she felt as though she had committed a mistake, entranced in her own desires.*Amethyst finally managed to collect herself and finished her bath. The maids immediately brought her a change of lingerie and a dress for her.The lingerie was an all-in-one underwear, tightly lined with laces combined with a bra and a waist nipper, making her feel like one of the models of the Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie show that she had seen on the Internet.She who had only ever worn hundred percent cotton underwear, touched the lingerie in awe. She wondered if it would be okay for her to wear something so soft and delicate.Then her eyes fell on the tight corset and dress, and she frowned.\u201cUmm\u2026 I was hoping to wear something more comfortable than a dress. Something not as tight. And i also don\u2019t need a corset.\u201d\u201cBut Madam. This is the only clothes that are ready/ The only comfortable dress is this thin evening dress \u2026.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll wear that.\u201d\u201cYes Madam but at least the undergarment\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh alright.\u201dAmethyst had never been a big fan of tight clothes. Whenever she got off work, she would wear a large boxy t-shirt and shorts over the whole weekend, so for her, the tight dresses were good enough to qualify as torture. When she was at home, she had never even worn a bra.Amethyst carefully lifted up the lingerie. Then she cautiously wore the flower lacy lingerie and put on the evening dress.It was a pale yellow cream coloured, simple and modern, high waist body dress. Then she put on an embroidered gown and covered herself.She went to her bed and had just lied down, when a thought suddenly struck her, making her get out of bed. When she walked the lacy and silk gown moved along with her pace. She secretly liked the feeling of the silk sleeves around her wrist.Amethyst\u2019s destination was the Prince\u2019s office.Even though it was called an office, it was far grander than the public library nearby.Books were tightly and concisely arranged. She looked around but couldn\u2019t find any book to suit her interest. After much contemplation she picked a few books and returned to her room.Once she returned, a maid asked.\u201cMadam, you\u2019ve not eaten anything yet. Shall I prepare something and a pot of tea?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 now that you mention it, I am rather hungry. I\u2019ll have it in the bedroom then.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 An Unplanned Seduction (1)Amethyst lay on her bed and began to leaf through the book on plants that she had picked from the library.After a year, she would have to leave this place. She would then desperately need to start looking for a way to make a living, and she didn\u2019t want to find herself lost along the journey to achieving her goal. Therefore, it was crucial to her, that she familiarise herself with all the possibilities that lay before her.The other reason why she chose that book was because it was the only one in Alec\u2019s office that had pictures in it and was perhaps, the easiest to read.\u201cHmm\u2026Bolvitart? This looks like a herb. I wonder if it is indeed edible? Since it isn\u2019t stated here that it\u2019s poisonous, maybe I can. Oh, this one looks like a pumpkin leaf!\u201cKonfrostart? What a name! Why can\u2019t they name it something easy like potato, barley, corn or spinach.\u201dKnock knock.A maid brought in a tray of food after knocking to notify her arrival. As she tried to carry it over to the table in a corner of the room, Amethyst stopped her.\u201cWill you bring it here instead?\u201dThe maid hesitated before bringing it to her. Amethyst told the maid to leave it on the bed and gestured for her to leave. There were all easily digestible kinds of food on the tray.\u201cOh man\u2026I really wanted to eat some meat.\u201dThe dishes in front of her lacked the meat dishes she liked so much. Her favourite lunch time menu consisted of cutlets, stir fried meat and previously on the weekends, she had eaten grilled pork belly for breakfast.\u2018Tomorrow I must put in a request for some meat.\u2019Putting her longings for meat aside, she enjoyed the warm buttery soup by dipping toasted breadsticks in it as she immersed herself into the book.She broke off a small piece of bread and flipped the page, sipped on her drink, and then flipped another. As she ate, breadcrumbs fell on the bed sheet, and the drink splattered onto its white expanse, but she found herself strangely unperturbed.Her old self would have jumped at the idea of breadcrumbs on the bed, but now she found that she couldn\u2019t be bothered about it. Simply changing her sitting position, she continued flipping the pages of the book.As she started to feel fuller, she felt somewhat suffocated. Amethyst sat up, crossed her knees, then looking around, took off her undergarments and threw it on the table next to the bed.\u201cHuh, finally now I can breathe! I guess not anybody can be a Victoria\u2019s Secret angel after all.\u201dShe lay back down and kicking her legs in the air, started humming a tune. She took a bite of the cookie, the maid had brought along with her breakfast and turned the page of her book.*\u201cWhere is Ash?\u201d Alexcent, who had barely managed to complete only the urgent pieces of work, returned to the mansion and asked Pon.\u201cMadam is in the bedroom.\u201d\u201cThe bedroom?\u201d\u201cYes. Well\u2026according to the maids she even ate in the bedroom and has not left since then. Perhaps she is not feeling well-\u201dAlexcent frowned at Pon\u2019s statement. He couldn\u2019t help but be concerned if it was because of yesterday and headed straight to her bedroom instead of his office.Knock knockAlexcent opened the door as he knocked and frowned at what he saw. Then lifted one of his eyebrows in part disdain and part amusement. On the bed, surrounding her, were plates, books, pieces of tissue, crumbs of biscuits and tea ware.\u201cWhat\u2026a scene.\u201dAmethyst sat up in surprise as she heard an unexpected voice. \u201cWhat are you doing home at this hour?\u201d\u201cI heard you weren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d\u201cNot feeling well? Who, me?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard you didn\u2019t leave the bedroom even once today. Were you here like this the whole day?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean the whole day, it\u2019s only noon. I can stay like this for a week!\u201dIgnoring Amethyst\u2019s reply, Alexcent let out a resigned sigh and walked towards the bed to picked up the book.\u201cBotany? I didn\u2019t know you were interested in such things.\u201d\u201cAh, well it\u2019s not that I\u2019m interested. I couldn\u2019t find any other interesting books in your office-\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you do something more productive and efficient.\u201d\u201cProductive?\u201d Amethyst asked.\u201cYes. Rather than dirty the bedroom\u2026!\u201dSuddenly Alexcent\u2019s ears turned red, and he was unable to continue his sentence.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAsh, you didn\u2019t go to my office like that, did you?\u201dAmethyst followed Alexcent\u2019s gaze and saw that her nipples, through her thin slip dress, were very prominently highlighted by the wrinkles of her dress.As she wore a see-through dress where the bright sun cast a backlight around her, she appeared very sensual. Amethyst quickly pulled at her gown and wrapped herself with it, flustered at the look in his eyes.\u201cNo, nobody saw me! And why are your ear turning red! You\u2019re\u2026making me embarrassed!\u201d\u201cAsh\u2026 Have you forgotten that we have male servants as well? What if\u2026.\u201d Just the thought of it put Alexcent in a bad mood; his ashen face betrayed it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 An Unplanned Seduction (2) | 19He was right. She may have promised herself that she would live doing whatever she liked, but there was a boundary that she shouldn\u2019t cross. And now that she was the wife of the prince, her rank was higher than that of a noble lady.Amethyst tried to appease him as she studied his darkened expression.\u201cAlec, I\u2019ll be careful from now on.\u201d\u201cAnd if you are going to seduce anyone, it\u2019ll only be me.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean, seduce? The undergarments were so suffocating I\u2014hmm!\u201dAlexcent swallowed her excuses by blocking her mouth with his lips. He bit on her fleshy lips and pushed his tongue inside. Her tongue drew back in surprise but as the thrilling sensation spread, she responded passionately by wrapping her tongue around his.Once he was assured of her consent, Alexcent placed his hand on her breasts.As he felt the soft sensation of the breasts beneath the silky dress with his hands, he felt aroused.He dived in, fondling her [email\u00a0protected] as she breathed roughly, his lips traced her neck where he could feel her heartbeat, then slid down her collar to her [email\u00a0protected] He opened his mouth and sucked on her [email\u00a0protected] over the dress.As Amethyst felt his lips and tongue through the dress, she held back her breath.\u201cHmm! Ale\u2026lec!\u201dAs she had been wearing nothing beneath her dress, she ended up inevitably wetting it. She felt foolish for beating herself up this morning for enjoying this sensation last night.This must be why people can\u2019t get over addictions easily. Everything about him was as sweet as a drug.With his large hands, Alexcent swiped everything away from the bed.Crash!Along with the sound of something breaking, all the items fell to the floor. He lay Amethyst down on the bed and was about to get a good taste of her.\u201cAlec\u2026it\u2019s only noon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already too late.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201dHis hand moved down to her centre. As he felt her wet dress, he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re dripping something as delicious as this and yet you deny seducing me.\u201d\u201cWell, no this is\u2026.hmmm!\u201dHe quickly raised her dress and inserted his finger. Feeling the wetness, he rubbed her with his large hand and soon she became intoxicated by the touch of him. The temptation of lu$t was irresistible to her as she had already tasted it once.At first it was difficult, but afterwards she succumbed to it so easily. Unlike her rational mind, her instincts were unsatisfied with just his hand. As she desired more sensation, she lifted her hips up against his hand and moved her hips.Alec too was at his limit.The moment he had entered the bedroom and set his eyes on her, he had felt the tightness in his pants. He recalled her supple skin and the softness of it. Then as his eyes fell on her exposed [email\u00a0protected] , he felt himself aroused beyond words.Alexcent\u2019s lips stayed connected to hers while his hands desperately ripped away at his clothes. He undid his belt, pulled down his pants, threw away his tie that had been suffocating his neck, undid his buttons and lastly took off his shirt.Amethyst wrapped her arms around his neck and clung onto him. As he felt the heat of his arousal, his hands felt her bare skin.\u201cMmmm\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs\u2026.sh.\u201dHis voice, mixed in with the sound of his breath, sounded desperate. He who couldn\u2019t hold himself back any longer, approached her centre. It seemed like he had long lost his rationale.As he was about to enter her, he heard Amethyst\u2019s voice.\u201cNo.\u201dHe looked up in surprise with his stiff body and wondered if she was rejecting him.\u201cNot\u2026.yet. A bit more\u2026.\u201dShe needed more. his display of affection had made her feel like she was on cloud nine and made her forget everything. Making her believe that she was the real Amethyst.She didn\u2019t want s3x that ended with just thrusting like with Heeyeon\u2019s husband, but the kind of affectionate and adoring sex that Amethyst\u2019s husband, Alexcent gave.Alexcent who had thought he was being rejected, smiled as she said \u2018more.\u2019\u201cOf course, as much as you want.\u201d Alexcent pecked her on the lip and buried his face in between her legs. He brought his desire to his lips. Starting with a short kiss, he stayed for a long and slow time. As she felt his hot breathing tingle her skin, she shuddered in pleasure.She combed her fingers through his hair and bit her lip to stop herself from moaning out loud.\u201cHa\u2026ah\u2026please!\u201dHis tongue was soft and yet firm, sharp and yet gentle. His continuous licking and movement of his tongue drove Amethyst into a blissful [email\u00a0protected] As the feeling of ecstasy tickled her entire body, her centre started dripping. His sweat, her liquid, wet the bed sheet.When she saw her ready for him, Alec inserted himself with a groan. His pace was unhurried, however, it escalated to a deep and brutal penetration as the minute grew. Hence, Amethyst found herself chasing after her breath, her walls squeezing his length, driving him to insanity.Their love making which had started in broad daylight, came to an end in the late hours of the night. As they cooled off the heat, Alexcent lay next to Amethyst and lovingly held her in his arms as they fell asleep together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 \u2013 The Noble Lady in a Simple Frock (1)Alexcent got up before her as usual. As soon as he woke up, he felt something tickling his nose. He rubbed at it sleepily and looked down to see what it was. He was surprised to see that he had been lying on top of Amethyst\u2019s pillow with her. He slowly sat up as to not wake her up and put on his gown without a sound before getting up from the bed.CLANG!Alexcent came to a sudden halt at the sound of his foot hitting something on the floor and quickly glanced behind at Amethyst lying on the bed.\u201cMmm\u2026Alec?\u201dHe had tried to be cautious but her sleep still had been disturbed. Alexcent clicked his tongue and approached her side of the bed, sat beside her and stroked her hair.\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\u201cWhat about\u2026you?\u201d\u201cIt is time for me to get up.\u201d\u201cThen I will too.\u201d Amethyst sat up barely able to open her eyes and lifted her arms to stretch. A groan left her when air popped from her joints and her muscles ached.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dAlexcent carefully massaged her shoulder.\u201cSleep a little more. You can\u2019t even open your eyes.\u201d\u201cI wanted to do something more productive today.\u201d\u201cProductive?\u201d\u201cYes, For example\u2026. shopping.\u201dAt the words shopping, the hand massaging Amethyst\u2019s shoulder stopped. Recalling the experience from the previous shopping trip for the wedding dress, he quickly shot up from the bed.\u201cWell then it\u2019s getting late. I should start getting ready for work.\u201d\u201cAlec.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d He distractedly asked while his eyes flitted from side to side.\u201cAre you trying to run away from here?\u201d She tilted her head and gazed at him.\u201cOf course not.\u201dAs Alexcent tried to avoid her eyes, Amethyst\u2019s eyes glimmered.\u201cAlec, do you want to go shopping with me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He replied bluntly.\u201cBut why? Let\u2019s go together, it\u2019ll be so much fun. Just like old\u2014\u201dAlexcent stopped her from talking with his mouth. Unlike the rough kisses like yesterday, it was a warm and gentle kiss. Amethyst instinctively closed her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll send Lunia with you. Enjoy yourself. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dHe then left the bedroom hurriedly before she could even reply. He couldn\u2019t believe he had actually considered her request for a minute. He let out a sigh of relief and ordered the maid who was standing in front of the door.\u201cClean up the room.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThen he spoke to Pon who was trailing behind him.\u201cGet rid of all male staff wherever Amethyst is. Rather, only allow female staff in the inner house.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d He looked taken aback by the unusual order from his master.\u201cIncluding yourself.\u201d\u201cIncluding m\u2014\u201d he cut himself off at a sharp glance from the prince. \u201cUnderstood sir.\u201dThis was a necessary precaution for Amethyst who didn\u2019t like to wear \u2018uncomfortable undergarments\u2019, but Pon could only understand the reason after hearing the gossip from the maids serving Amethyst.\u201cAlso, Amethystwants to go out today. Send Lunia to escort her.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dWith those orders he strode into his private bedroom to prepare for the day.*A soft knock sounded on the door.\u201cMa\u2019am, it\u2019s Lunia. I\u2019ve come to escort you for the day.\u201d\u201cOh! Come in Miss Lunia. long time no see.\u201d\u201cPlease call me Lunia, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dLunia, the second secretary of the Prince greeted her respectfully. She seemed to have been appointed as Amethyst\u2019s personal secretary for the day. Amethyst smiled and with the help of her maids, started getting ready.\u201cMmm, I don\u2019t like anything heavy. I prefer something lighter and simple that would be easy to move around in while shopping.\u201d She looked at her dresses but when she didn\u2019t find anything resembling what she wanted, she turned around to look at what they were wearing. \u201cAha! Something like what Lunia is wearing.\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am?!\u201d All the ladies around her gasped indignantly.\u201cIt\u2019s neat and simple, just what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\u201cBut, Ma\u2019am, noble ladies do not wear attires like these. This kind of dress is only worn by commoners or employees like mysel,.\u201d Lunia calmly explained.\u201cWell, that\u2019s not an issue for me and why care about what others say. Please prepare one for me.\u201d She said in a tone that left no room for argument.\u201cYes Ma\u2019am, understood.\u201dThe maids went back into the dressing room and came back with a simple dress, much to Amethyst\u2019s satisfaction. She quickly changed into the dress they had brought. After Lunia boarded the carriage Pon had prepared for them, it left the estate and began to speed up. They passed through the inner part of the city and across the park, a new road unfolded, as if it had just been constructed.As the carriage came to a stop, Amethyst got off it and exclaimed excitedly, taking in her surroundings. \u201cOh my! Where are we? This place is different from where we went before, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes Ma\u2019am. This is Newhenfield. His Highness designed this place himself.\u201d\u201cAlexcent? Alec did himself?\u201d\u201cYes. The reason why he was so busy recently is because of this city. The capital is vintage and most of its buildings are old, so it wasn\u2019t able to expand much in the tourism sector. Turns out people prefer luxurious and fancy places as compared to vintage ones. So, he had this section developed from his designs.\u201d\u201cWow, he must be the god of buildings.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dThey started walking and Amethyst couldn\u2019t help her gaze flitting around from building to building. Each and every building had its own unique character and style and looked like a piece of art. The streets were well-organized and clean. She couldn\u2019t close her mouth that was hanging open in awe of his talent.\u2018Alec made this!I should have asked for a building situated here as a wedding gift. After all, real estate is the best way to earn money.\u2019She silently laughed at her own musings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 \u2013 The Noble Lady in a Simple Frock (2)With Lunia\u2019s guidance, she explored the streets and shops, and her eyes roved over every single thing. Just like the luxurious city, the people in it were just as fancy. She spotted a pretty dress in the display of a boutique and decided to pay it a visit. Just by the look of the dress, it looked like a luxury collection shop. The pale coral pink dress on display had sparkling jewels that decorated the dress\u2019 neckline and waist.\u201cLunia, let\u2019s look here.\u201d Amethyst\u2019s eyes glistened brightly as she went inside without a minute of hesitation.As she had expected it was full of young noble ladies, clearly from the richer end of the population. A boutique clerk haughtily glanced at Amethyst and Lunia as they entered, her eyes falling to their plain clothes.\u201cWelcome. May I help you?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to take a look at that dress on the display.\u201d Amethyst gestured towards the dress.\u201cThat dress is a unique piece, so it is quite expensive.\u201d The clerk looked Amethyst up and down as if she was measuring her worth. Even though she spoke in an overly sweet tone, it was obvious that she was looking down on Amethyst.\u201cReally? How much is it?\u201dAt the word \u2018expensive\u2019, Amethyst felt disheartened. She had been the kind of person who couldn\u2019t afford to buy a single dress even when she was at an outlet sale that happened once or twice a year, let alone a department store sale. But even with the heavily applied discounts she couldn\u2019t even dream of buying something so expensive. She was used to putting down outfits that she liked.\u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely a price you can\u2019t afford to pay. But we do have other dresses besides that one. So please do take a look.\u201d\u201cExcuse me! Who do you think\u2014\u201dAmethyst finally understood that the clerk was serving them with a smile but definitely mocking them. Lunia tried to step in, but Amethyst stopped her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lunia. Let\u2019s just have a look around.\u201d\u201cBut ma\u2019am\u2014\u201dAmethyst took a hold of Lunia\u2019s arm and dragged her away to look at the other dresses.\u201cOh Lunia, look at this! Don\u2019t you think this yellow dress is so pretty? Look at these adorable small flower details, and the sleeves are decorated with lace! It looks like it is made for a romantic evening.\u201d\u201cIndeed Ma\u2019am. I think you will look beautiful in this as well. Why don\u2019t you try it on?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, should I?\u201d Amethyst looked around then approached the clerk from before and asked.\u201cCan I try on this dress?\u201d\u201cSorry dear, in our boutique you can\u2019t try on the dresses.\u201dNow Amethyst was starting to feel annoyed with the clerk as well. She could clearly see a fitting room in the corner. The clerk was just being petty by not letting her try on the beautiful dress, which was surely expensive, given all the small details on it.She felt like saying \u2018Give me everything in this shop! I will buy it all!\u2019, but she couldn\u2019t. So, she just turned her back on the clerk and thought about what she could do. After a moment, she came to a conclusion and turned to Lunia.\u201cBetween the pastel pink dress and this pale yellow one, I would like to buy one. Lunia which one do you think would suit me more?\u201d\u201cBoth of them will Ma\u2019am. Why don\u2019t you buy both of them?\u201d\u201cHow can I? The clerk said that they are very expensive.\u201dLunia was puzzled by her mistress. Did she really believe them to be out of her reach? She now knew for sure that the lady of the house had no interest in her husband\u2019s wealth. If that wasn\u2019t true, then why would she possibly be contemplating between two dresses because of their price. To Lunia, her simplistic mistress, was praise-worthy.Suddenly, there was a commotion outside which made both of them turn around; a noble household\u2019s young lady was coming towards them. The clerk quickly rushed towards them and greeted them.\u201cOh my, if it isn\u2019t the young Lady Keaton of the Granovia household? Welcome Milady.\u201d\u201cYou have a good memory if you remember me, for I have only been here once.\u201d\u201cOf course! How could I forget a beautiful lady like you? How is the marchioness? Please send her my regards, I would love to see her here again.\u201d\u201cI will. Anyways, I found the dress in the display very pretty and I came to take a closer look.\u201d\u201cAs expected of a fair lady, you have good taste.\u201d\u201cDo I?\u201d She asked in a tone that showed she very well knew she had good taste.\u201cYes! But I must inform you that this is a unique piece. So, the price of that dress is quite high.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dAmethyst noticed that the lady became a little tense. And she didn\u2019t blame her, because she was tense too. If the clerk could not readily recommend it to a noble lady then it was certainly an amount that she would not be able to afford. The wedding dress she had bought with Alec\u2019s money was a once in a lifetime experience. She had bought it after seeking Alec\u2019s permission as she wanted it to be grand. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to splurge on a luxury dress that she would only wear a few times. After listening to their conversation Amethyst was just about to let go of the hem of the pink dress when the clerk spoke again.\u201cYes. Which is why we don\u2019t recommend it to just anyone.\u201d The clerk let out a nauseating chuckle. \u201cBut for you it is perfect! Would you like to try it on? It\u2019s a beautiful dress definitely worth its price.\u201dAfter hearing the clerk\u2019s words, the last bit of Amethyst\u2019s patience snapped. The difference in her attitude with the lady and with her, made her feel enraged.She just said that I couldn\u2019t try it on! No matter where you go there are always these kinds of people that judge people by their appearances!\u201cExcuse me but I was looking at this first. I believe I have the right to buy it first as well?\u201dThe clerk seemed taken aback by Amethyst\u2019s unexpected sharp tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 Waste of Time (1)The clerk ignored Amethyst\u2019s statement and addressed the lady with the fake smile painted on her face. \u201cLady Keaton, would you like to look around for a while? We have some new dresses that are very beautiful as well. In the meantime, I will prepare the dress for you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe young Lady Keaton looked Amethyst up and down before smirking and walking away. After waiting for her to walk away, the clerk turned around to face Amethyst. \u201cLike I said earlier dear, this is a dress that you cannot afford. Why don\u2019t you give it to the lady instead? There are a lot of dresses on sale on the other side.\u201dEven though her words were poisonous, the smile never left her face. Amethyst decided to buy the pink dress no matter what, just to prove this clerk wrong.\u201cI will decide whether I buy it or not. And since I chose this dress first, I will try it first.\u201d\u201cOh dear, I wasn\u2019t going to say this, but do you really think with your plain looks you can handle a magnificent dress like this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026did you just say?!\u201d Lunia gasped infuriatedly.Just then another employee approached the clerk and whispered something in her ear. The clerk nodded and side-eyed them before walking away with the other employee.\u201cTsk! What kind of person is she?\u201d Amethyst bit out.\u201cMa\u2019am, please reveal your identity. There is a dire need to reprimand such a person.\u201d\u201cNo, never! There is no need to go to that extent for someone like that. They are not worthy.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s mood was completely spoiled, and she had half a mind to just let go of the dress and leave this place.\u201cReally, if you weren\u2019t so pretty, I would never have stepped into this place,\u201d She muttered to the dress.Meanwhile, she noticed that the direction in which the clerk had gone, there was complete silence. She peeked around the corner and saw that every single person in the shop only had eyes for one sight; the man who had just entered. He brushed his silky platinum hair back from his face and his glistening red eyes. His broad frame seemed to fill up the entire boutique with his presence. She was surprised by his sudden appearance and she wasn\u2019t the only one.The clerk was well aware of who the man was, and she stumbled in her haste to step forward.\u201cMy goodness! Your Highness please may I welcome you to our humble boutique! It is a great honour. I am Madam Brita, the manager of the store. It would be an honour to serve you\u2014\u201dMuch to her pleasure, Alexcent\u2019s eyes searched the shop while the clerk spoke with annoyance etched onto his face. As he looked around, the ladies who mistakenly thought that they had caught his eye, blushed and giggled. When they both finally locked eyes, he walked straight towards her; the woman who had caught his eye, cutting off the clerk without an excuse.Lunia sensed someone\u2019s presence behind her, she took her eyes away from Amethyst to look around. As she saw Alexcent, she bowed and moved aside.Alexcent wrapped his arms around Amethyst\u2019s waist and kissed her briefly on the lips. Amethyst was taken aback by his affection. She hadn\u2019t expected him to behave this way in public.\u201cAre you done with your shopping?\u201d\u2018Wasn\u2019t this the same person who tried to get himself out of going shopping together just this morning?\u2019\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI was in the area when I saw your carriage. Are you still far from done?\u201d Alexcent looked around her impatiently.Lunia glanced at the clerk who had served them earlier. As she saw the clerk unable to close her mouth and staring at the two in shock, Lunia couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of satisfaction.\u201cYou\u2019re just in time, Alec. Out of these two dresses which one do you think is prettier?\u201dAmethyst looked up at him with large sparkling eyes and took turns in bringing the dresses near her frame, asking him to choose one. Alec realized he was reliving the horrors of the other day and quickly called the clerk over, who finally seemed to come to her senses as she approached them rigidly.\u201cYes, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cPack everything from here to there,\u201d he waved his hand but then thought of something else. \u201cBetter yet, just pack everything here and send it to the palace. Including the ones that my wife is holding.\u201dThe madam looked ready to faint.\u201cAlec?!\u201d As Amethyst spoke in a surprised tone, Alexcent coolly met her gaze and continued.\u201cWhat are you contemplating about? If you like them, just buy them all. What a waste of time to choose between two.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026you\u2014\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d He rose an eyebrow, challenging her to speak something against him in public. But she was only impressed by him.\u201cNothing, you\u2019re awesome.\u201dAlexcent was as awesome as the main character in her favourite novel. She showed him a thumbs up and smiled widely.The clerk seemed deep in shock, as the person she had just looked down on was the wife of the prince. Then shocked again by the fact that the famous prince of blood had just bought the entire shop for his wife. She couldn\u2019t fathom which she found more surprising. Probably both.\u201cAre you still not done yet?\u201d Alexcent asked in an agitated voice.The clerk finally came to her senses and started to move hurriedly. Even though she was busy packing, she found the time to discreetly approach Amethyst and whisper to her.\u201cMy Lady, I am so sorry for my rudeness and not having recognized you earlier on. Please don\u2019t hold it against me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 Waste of Time (2)Amethyst didn\u2019t say anything and simply smiled, letting the clerk stew in uncertainty. She just watched as she quickly moved onto the dresses and moved around busily, packing the dresses into boxes. The number of boxes piling up increased, and just as the packing was nearly done, Amethyst hooked her arms around Alec and spoke.\u201cNow that I think about it, I don\u2019t think I will be needing them all Alec. I just want to purchase the two that I was torn between.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is it not the more dresses, the better with you ladies?\u201d\u201cI doubt I can carry these magnificent dresses with my plain looks.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say? Who dared to say such a thing to you?\u201d\u2018Unbelievable! He must have forgotten that he too had said something like that to me before.\u2019Alexcent\u2019s low voice sounded life-threatening and it seemed highly possible that if Amethyst were to point out who it was, that person would be beheaded on the spot. Madam Brita who had been busily packing, came to a stop, and the sound of her gulping could be heard across the room.\u201cWho would say such a thing to me. I\u2019m just thinking out loud.\u201d Amethyst withdrew her gaze from Alec and approached Madam Brita, who looked ready to blow over by the slightest gust of wind.\u201cI will only purchase the yellow and pastel pink dress I was looking at earlier.\u201dThe poor clerk could only nod.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you went through all the trouble to wrap them up. But I just changed my mind.\u201d\u201cNot a problem at all, my lady! Please don\u2019t concern yourself. Not a problem!\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? What a kind heart.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you! Please come again. I will personally serve you the best then.\u201d\u201cWell, I doubt there will be a next time. I find I\u2019m not compatible with people who judge others based on their appearance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026my lady please forgive me.\u201d\u201cExcuse me please.\u201dLeaving the miserable looking Madam Brita behind, Amethyst took Alexcent\u2019s arm and left the boutique.Why would I raise the sales of a shop owned by someone like her? Hmph.Thanks to Alexcent\u2019s unexpected appearance she felt much better with her small revenge. She couldn\u2019t help but feel touched by Alec who had fulfilled her dream of buying \u2018everything from here to there.\u2019*As they left the boutique, Alexcent led a beaming Amethyst towards the carriage.\u201cAlec.\u201dAlexcent felt nervous when she called out his name in a gentle voice, which was ridiculous. He was a prince! He didn\u2019t get nervous.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d\u201cWith what?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think. Shopping of course.\u201dHe groaned beneath his breath.\u201cCome on let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAmethyst.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI still have some work to do and then we have to return back to the palace.\u201d\u201cImpossible, nuh-uh, no way.\u201dAmethyst was not about to let him get away. She smiled cheekily and grabbed his strong arms and led him as far away from the carriage. Even though he was more than capable of pulling her back, he decided not to. But he did fuss and complain as Amethyst dragged him as she pleased.They looked at books in a large bookstore, passed by a small jewelry shop with cute jewelry on display. Rather, she stopped and looked, he would just stop where she stopped.\u201cWow! That looks delicious! Alec, look! Doesn\u2019t it look delicious? Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d Amethyst entered a dessert place that was exuding a sweet aroma and found an empty table. A polite server came over to take their order.\u201cWhat are you going to have Alec? Let\u2019s order one each and share. This and this, and\u2026 oh no, they all look sooo good.\u201dWhile Amethyst was absorbed in the menu, a firm voice spoke. \u201cBring everything on the menu.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d The server, who was aware of who he was, greeted them politely and left. \u201cAlec! That\u2019s too much. We won\u2019t be able to eat everything.\u201d\u201cLike I told you before, why waste your time contemplating?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean waste time? There\u2019s so much joy in choosing what you want.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you to save yourself the trouble and save that time.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s easy for rich people like you. But for me who earns a living on a daily\u2014\u201d\u201cDaily what?\u201d\u201cN-nothing. I was just feeling too happy.\u201d She said, followed by a nervous laugh.She then quickly closed her mouth, realizing she had nearly made a mistake. A brief awkward moment passed but thankfully the server brought the prepared cake, tarts and pie and lay it out on the table in front of them.\u201cWhat may I serve first?\u201d\u201cThe cake!\u201d Amethyst exclaimed excitedly. Then she eagerly took a fork and brought it to her mouth. As the soft texture and sweat taste exploded in her mouth, she savored the taste with her eyes closed.Next, she took a bite of the pie. The crispness of the pastry amazed her.\u201cIt\u2019s so crispy!\u201dWhatever she ate, she never fell short of compliments. Fascinated, Alexcent smiled. Then he brushed the crumbs from Amethyst\u2019s mouth who was focused on only the food in front of her.\u201cOthers will think that I don\u2019t feed you.\u201d\u201cAll the desert here is so good that I can eat it even though I\u2019m so full. You should try some too!\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, you should just enjoy yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why? You\u2019ll regret it later.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThey looked at each other for a moment before Alexcent sighed and looked at Amethyst disapprovingly.\u201cDo you\u2026perhaps not like sweet things?\u201d She asked slowly.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd what?\u201d\u201cYou keep looking at me like that.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cLike you don\u2019t want to be here?\u201d She guessed vaguely but was surprised by his answer.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Her voice raised slightly over his.\u201cIt is a waste of time sitting here like this.\u201d\u201cWaste of time?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2013 A Doting Husband (1)\u201cYes. It\u2019s not productive and it feels like you\u2019re meaninglessly wasting time.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of the man before her. He had actually answered. And that too, so truthfully, without fear of her bashing his head in. Maybe he didn\u2019t even realize that she was mad. She was so surprised that she actually calmed down.\u201cBloody hell! Are you possessed by a workaholic ghost or something? I mean how can someone work all the time?\u201d\u201cWorkaholic?\u201d\u201cYes! You should rest when you are resting and work when you are working to increase efficiency. If people work like you, they will never be able to date their entire life and die alone! Now tell me honestly.\u201d She leaned closer to him in curiosity. \u201cHave you ever dated anyone before?\u201d\u201cWhy would I do such a thing?\u201dShe fell back in the chair, her eyebrows raised and mouth open in shock. \u201cWow. Look at you\u2026no wonder you\u2019ve never dated anyone and gotten yourself into a contract marriage. You\u2019re a soloist.\u201d\u201cWhat? Soloist? What is that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cSolo! Someone who\u2019s never dated since they were born.\u201dAlexcent tilted his head and spoke as if it was bothersome. \u201cAmethyst, I don\u2019t have to do something as frivolous as dating. I am enough as I am.\u201dShe narrowed her eyes at him. The ideal guy who had it all; looks, brains, or wealth. He didn\u2019t need to try to look good for a woman, or ask someone on a date. He was a perfect guy and women fell at his feet no matter where he was. And the worst part was, he was well aware of it.\u2018Those who are pretty, always know they are.\u2019\u201cWhat an eyesore.\u201d She mumbled beneath her breath and went back to her cake.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said, the cake is delicious.\u201d She said and brought the fork to her lips, so she wouldn\u2019t have to speak anymore.After they were out of the caf\u00e9, she dragged Alec around the streets of Newhenfield, and went through almost every shop until he had had enough.*\u201cGo!\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAfter almost shoving Amethyst into the carriage, Alexcent ordered the coachman to move. Amethyst too was slightly tired. She had been devious and had done her best to annoy him, feeling satisfied as she saw his expressions turn into a deeper grimace. But once she was seated in the carriage, she realized how numb her feet and legs were. She moaned in pain as she felt the heat and soreness in her feet.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dShe considered not telling him, not wanting to admit that her venture had tired her too, but quickly gave in.\u201cMy feet hurt. I guess I walked too much today.\u201d\u201cTsk, I told you to take it easy.\u201dWhile Alexcent clicked his tongue and rebuked her, Amethyst fought the urge to poke her tongue out at him. The carriage came to a stop at the entrance of the mansion and Alexcent descended first. Amethyst went to follow suit when he lifted her up in his arms and carried her inside.\u201cAh! Alec!\u201d\u201cStop moving. Didn\u2019t you say your feet hurt?\u201d\u201cYes, but I can still walk on my own!\u201d\u201cStay still or I will drop you.\u201dEven though he spoke harshly, she knew he would never do it. She wrapped her arms around his neck and stopped squirming.\u201cIf you drop me, I will kick your butt.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d He looked down at her in shock. \u201cIf you do that, I will spank you.\u201d\u201cThen I will hit you until my handprint is on your back.\u201d\u201cReally? I will pinch your cheeks and shake your head.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare! I will\u2026\u201d\u201cWelcome back\u201dAs Pon approached and greeted them politely, Amethyst\u2019s flushed with embarrassment. But Pon didn\u2019t seem to notice and greeted them naturally with a carefree face.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s a little late but should I still ask them to prepare dinner?\u201dAt Pon\u2019s question, Alexcent looked towards Amethyst, asking her opinion in silence. Amethyst who was still in his arms, shook her head and spoke.\u201cNo. I ate so much just now, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cNeither am I. Just bring me some hot water and towels.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAlexcent entered the bedroom, and placed her down gently on the bed. There was a knock on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve brought the hot water and towel you asked for.\u201d\u201cLeave it here and go.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness\u201dAs instructed, the maids placed the basin of steaming warm water and clean towels on the table and left. Alexcent then brought the items to the bed and sat close to Amethyst. He then bent his knee and grabbed a hold of her foot hidden beneath her dress. Taking off her heels, his hands rose to her thighs to take off her stockings. Goosebumps rose on her skin and her hands bunched up her dress.\u201cAlec\u2026what are you doing?\u201d\u201cHold still.\u201dAt those words, Amethyst froze and simply watched him. Following his gentle movement, her stockings slowly descended her thighs and revealed her bare skin, showing her reddish little toe and slightly swollen feet.Alexcent let out a low sigh as he picked up the clean towel, wet it in hot water and wrapped it around her feet. Perhaps it was due to the warmth or the gentleness of his gesture, but she closed her eyes and relaxed as his hand massaged her feet over the hot towel.\u201cWhere did you learn to do something like this?\u201d\u201cDuring battle. There are times when your feet swell after a long march. How do you feel now?\u201d\u201cIt hurts less than before.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 A Doting Husband (2)Alexcent repeated the whole process when the towel cooled off, and wrapped her feet in a warm towel. Then he would massage her feet hoping the swelling would die down.\u201cAsh.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201da\u201cJust now, what did you mean when you said you are not compatible with people who judge others based on their appearances?\u201d As Alexcent asked nonchalantly, Amethyst tilted her head wondering what he was referring to. \u201cIn the afternoon, to the clerk at the boutique.\u201d\u201cOh! It\u2019s nothing for you to be bothered about. It was just\u2026a small misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cA small misunderstanding\u2026.\u201dAlexcent did not easily let her change the subject. When it seemed like she wasn\u2019t going to tell him, he increased the strength in his hand as he massaged her legs.\u201cAghh! Alec, that hurts!\u201d\u201cSo, tell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing. Ahhh, slower! Okay!\u201dAs he resumed massaging her gently, Amethyst told him what happened earlier on as she had no other choice. Alexcent\u2019s face stiffened as he listened to her story silently, but as he was someone who barely showed facial expressions, Amethyst didn\u2019t notice.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes, it was a small matter.\u201d\u201cIt is not small.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI planned every single detail when it comes to Newhenfield. There isn\u2019t a single place where I have not been involved in making. That\u2019s how perfectly I have planned it to be, so I don\u2019t want to miss out on anything no matter how small.\u201dAmethyst contemplated the matter for a while before opening her mouth to speak up.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, then reeducating the clerk might be good. Because for me, I had the title as your wife and received an apology. But I\u2019m sure there are far more cases where they don\u2019t. Also, you might want to consider the parallel scenario.\u201d\u201cParallel?\u201d\u201cYes. Where the customer says or behaves rudely, requesting for services beyond their obligation, or causing a situation. Clerks are employees who are paid for their services, they are not slaves. Unlike what happened today, I\u2019m sure there are cases where a customer acts out to the employees. Even I\u2019m not familiar with how to deal with such situations. So, wouldn\u2019t it help if there was a manual of some sort to refer to?\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 I will take note. What else?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026The buildings were grand and just beautiful. The streets were clean and-\u201dWait, is he doing a service monitoring? Am I a survey target?\u201cHold on, did you intentionally tell Lunia to guide me to Newhenfield? You did, right? No wonder, I thought it was odd the moment you showed up!\u201d\u201cMaybe I did.\u201d\u201cReally, you! You-\u201d\u201cFrom now on you can shop in the mansion. You can call on the vendors. Save yourself the trouble.\u201d\u201cEven though I had no intention to shop in the near future, I will!\u201dAlexcent inserted his fingers in between Amethyst\u2019s toes and turned her feet slowly. Then he massaged her calf and loosened her tense muscles. His hand then crept up and stayed on her thigh. Her cheeks blushed at the pressure of his grasp.With a strange change in the atmosphere, his red eyes looked at her with a burning gaze and as their eyes met, he raised his upper body and took his face close to her lips.His forehead met her forehead\u2026His nose brushed against her nose\u2026She felt his hot breath on her face\u2026Amethyst couldn\u2019t resist the intense gaze and closed her eyes.Alexcent gently placed his lips on top of hers. Soon the kiss grew heated as they sucked on one another\u2019s lips.His tongue searched her mouth fiercely, while her tongue stroked his. As the situation grew more intense, Amethyst tapped on his shoulder. It was a passionate kiss, and her instinct wanted him but she was too tired today. She cleared her throat lightly as he looked at her.\u201cUmm Alec\u2026today\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. You must be tired. You should rest.\u201dShe kissed him on the cheek and reclined back on the bed. Alexcent stroked her hair with his large hand. As she felt the soothing strokes, her eyelids felt heavy and soon she fell into darkness.*The minute Alexcent entered his office, he turned to Gen who had been waiting for his arrival.\u201cDismiss the boutique I was at today.\u201d\u201cWhat? But they still have a long term left as they just signed the contract\u2014\u201dAs Alexcent shot him a cold look, Gen shut his mouth, silently passing him the contracts that needed his review.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201d\u201cAnd make sure all the shop owners and employees in Newhenfield are aware of today\u2019s happening.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cAnd on the other hand, we need to find a way to set a protocol to deal with rampant customers, so make a manual and make sure they\u2019re educated.\u201dGen looked at him in utter confusion as to what was going on but said nothing.\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cIf there are any key nobles that need exclusive treatment, create a list and manage them separately. Tourism may be important, but I\u2019m not running a charity. It\u2019s a necessity to give the nobles exclusive treatment since they secure our profits. But don\u2019t make it obvious.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d He collected the files that had been signed. \u201cYour Highness, the high priest Celios has requested for funds again.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 Taste of Home\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe must have lost quite a large amount. Did he raise his request to the head of Alst?\u201d\u201cNo. This time it was to the Fidorun Bank.\u201dFidorun Bank was a private bank managed by the Skad family through the shadows. It was notoriously known for its considerable interest rates. Although it was a bank on the surface, it was more like a private loan business. Therefore, it was rare for people to visit unless they were in dire need of cash.For Celios to visit the bank, revealed how bad his situation was. His terrible gambling addiction was common knowledge. However, due to his high position in the large temple, it was hushed up. To Alexcent, he was a good prey. The temple was like a spring; full of donations collected every week, every month, and every year, that didn\u2019t dry up.\u201cThat old man, he must have been quite desperate.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cApprove it. It\u2019s not our loss if he loses even more.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cTell them to loan him plenty, and also tell Kairan to increase the bid for this round. We should reap as much as we can. He might end up selling the temple at this rate.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir. Would that be all?\u201d\u201cYes, you may leave.\u201dAs Gen disappeared from sight, Alexcent leaned back in his chair and got lost in his thoughts.\u2018Soloist\u2026 workaholic\u2026 eyesore\u2019He wondered where she\u2019d learnt such phrases that weren\u2019t commonly used by noble families. Even his sister and Emperor Belice did not dare use such words. Yet there she was, speaking them as if it was nothing. Not only that, she had been meticulous and made suggestions on details that he had not been able to catch.An ordinary noble lady?No! She really was a fascinating woman.But it was even more fascinating that he was letting her act as such.\u203bThe man lowered his head and greeted her first. \u201cPleased to meet you, my lady. I\u2019m Hilder Kurn, the Commander-in-Chief of the Knights of the Prince.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Knight Hilder.\u201d\u201cPlease call me Hill. His Lordship calls me that way as well.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dSeriously? I must not be the only one he addresses as he pleases!Then the knights standing side by side offered their greetings to Amethyst as well.\u201cGreetings Madam. I am Buer, Commander of the First Division.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI am Leyrian, Commander of the Second Division. It is an honor to meet you.\u201dAfter that, Garf, Commander of the Third Division, and Marcus, Chief Knight of the First Division, greeted her.Wow! Do they pick the knights based on looks?Hilder was a firm looking, well-built sort of man that left you with a strong impression. Buer and Leyrian were cold and city-style kind of men, but still warm towards her. While Garf and Marcus glistened with playfulness and youth.I feel like I\u2019m at a movie set. Surrounded by beautiful men, what a treat to my eyes!Even so, Alec still topped the list.\u201cAnyways, Madam, what are you doing all the way here without a maid?\u201d\u201cOh! I smelt something delicious. Is that \u2026 intestine?!\u201dBehind the bulky knights, she saw a familiar sight.\u201cPardon?!\u201d The knights turned to look behind them, in the direction of Amethyst\u2019s gaze. Some of the knights who had finished training were sizzling something on a large grill. To be exact, it was a dish of animal\u2019s organ meats, eaten when there was a shortage of supplies during the war. It was a body part people didn\u2019t normally eat, but it was considered a great dish in times of war.\u201cOh my, oh my! Looks so delicious!\u201dAs she saw the plump tripe being grilled on a hot iron plate, Amethyst\u2019s eyes gleamed while her mouth watered.\u201cMa-madam \u2026 this is not a dish fit for a noble lady.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is this all you have? If there isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ll share my portion of steak!\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that, how could a noble lady like yourself eat this dish made of leftover parts?\u201d one knight asked her incredulously.\u201cThat\u2019s prejudice. I love that dish very much! I can\u2019t eat it because there isn\u2019t enough of it!\u201d\u201cSorry? How would Madam have tried this dish that is common only during the war?\u201d Hill asked in disbelief while looking at Amethyst.\u201cAh, I \u2026 I saw the knights at my estate eating it.\u201d She laughed nervously, hoping to cover up her bad lie. \u201cAnyways, that piece is burning! Flip it quick!\u201dMarcus who had been standing next to Hill flipped the pieces. The knights stood awkwardly looking at each other as they found it strange for their lady to suddenly appear out of nowhere and take such an interest in their low-class dish.Meanwhile, Amethyst\u2019s attention was entirely focused on the grilling tripe, to take note of the awkward atmosphere.\u201cDon\u2019t you think we can eat it now? I think it\u2019s all cooked.\u201d\u201cWill you really\u2026 be okay, my lady?\u201dAs Hill asked in a worried tone, Amethyst quickly picked up the most golden looking piece and popped it in her mouth. She bit into it, the savory and greasy meat wrapped around her tongue, and the chewy texture of the intestines made her eyes close in pleasure.\u201cMmm. This is it! Taste of home!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 \u2013 Piglet In the House | 19The knights who had been tensed up laughed out loud. The wife of the prince, who was considered to be the most elite of the noble ladies, was enjoying the roast of the knights. The Prince of Blood and his eccentric wife were a perfect pair indeed.\u201cIs there more?\u201d\u201cYes. There is.\u201d\u201cThen what are you doing! Put it on the grill. I get dizzy if my rhythm stops while I eat.\u201d\u201cSorry, Madam! Understood. Please, enjoy.\u201d Marcus quickly topped up the pan. Then as he was about to cut it into small pieces \u2026\u201cHey, you don\u2019t know the right way to eat this, do you? If you cut it now, all the juices will escape and it won\u2019t be tasty anymore. Cut it when it\u2019s nearly all cooked.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood, Madam.\u201dForgetting her title and rank, Amethyst sat crouching amongst the crowd of knights and looking eagerly at the tripe to cook.\u201cYou are very\u2026 peculiar, Madam.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFor you to eat this kind of food without any hesitation or disgust\u2014 \u201d\u201cWhy would I be disgusted by something as delicious as this?! You\u2019re the peculiar one. By the way, do you guys eat this every day?\u201d\u201cNo. We were reminded of the olden days and brought it to eat after our training.\u201d\u201cI see. Then next time when you eat it, will you invite me?\u201d\u201c\u2014 Do you really mean that?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cWell then yes. If that\u2019s what you want. Next time I will bring some vegetables. It tastes better if you eat it together.\u201d\u201cSure, please do.\u201dThanks to the knights, Amethyst was able to taste one of her favorite dishes again. She only stopped eating once her jaw started to ache.\u203b\u201cArgh, my chin hurts\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust what did you do for your chin to hurt?\u201dAlexcent frowned as he saw Amethyst rubbing her cheeks with her hands. He was sitting on her bed in a gown without even drying himself and examining her face carefully.\u201cI \u2026 ate too much.\u201d She hesitantly told him.\u201cHa? Have you now decided to become a pig?\u201d Even as Amethyst glared at him, he continued on unaffected. \u201cI think you are. Just the other day you turned the bedroom into a mess, and now you eat to the extent your chin hurts. I guess we will soon have a piglet to raise in the mansion. A pet pig of the mansion \u2026 Not bad, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cWhat do you take me for Alec! Hmm!\u201dAs she opened her mouth to shout, she felt pain in her chin and ended up groaning in pain.\u201cCome here.\u201dEven as he frowned, Alexcent took his large hands and massaged her chin.At times like this, he seems caring\u2026 but his words are always so mean. Ah, is he what they call a Tsundere?\u201cI guess I can\u2019t eat you today.\u201dAt those words, Amethyst blushed. Beneath the loosely tied gown, she could see his firm muscular abs. Her eyes wandered below, and something seemed to spring up right under the knotted string. The thought of it made her body feel hot as though she was placed on top of a grill like the tripes she had eaten.\u201cThen\u2026 you should at least\u2026 get dressed.\u201d\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d he raised a brow as he asked.\u201cObviously!\u201d\u201cOh, the piglet speaks!\u201d\u201cSeriously, you!\u201d Amethyst clenched her fist mimicking a punch, Alexcent laughed as he grabbed a hold of her wrist and pulled her to bed.\u201cI won\u2019t eat you today, so go to sleep.\u201d\u201cUmm well, you can\u2026 eat me if you want.\u201d\u201cWow, this piglet is saying something dangerous.\u201dCarefully, she placed a hand on his toned muscles. As warmth spread from the firmness under her palm, she subconsciously brought her lips to his chest.Peck!At the same time, Alexcent who had been taking deep breaths stopped. \u201cWell\u2026 I guess a baby pig is tasty as well,\u201d he said raspily.Putting a finger under her chin, he brought it away from his chest and towards his lips before invading her mouth.\u201cHmmm\u2026 .\u201dHer aching jaw made her flinch but Alexcent paid it no mind and began to plunder her mouth arbitrarily, sweeping his tongue evenly from the inside of her cheeks to the bottom of her tongue.With just a kiss, her body was already wet. He bit her lip, peppered kisses as he moved downward and lingered around her neck.His hands had managed to rip her dainty undergarments and moved vigorously between her legs. He applied pressure as he touched her, the satisfying sensation travelled through her body making her moan.\u201cAh\u2026 mm. Ale\u2026c\u201dAt the sound of her moans, she felt his smile on her neck. She turned her head and brought his lips to hers as if to hurry him.Ahh, his wet and warm tongue. Even his breath is delicious.Their kisses moved from lips to cheeks, ears, and necks. As his fingers continued to play between her legs, the sensation must have teased her for she clenched them around his hand, urging him on.Then, his long thick finger entered her, she reflexively lifted her hips up high. His finger continued to pleasure her but it seemed insufficient. Amethyst lifted her hips higher and ground against his hand.\u201cHa\u2026 please\u2026 .\u201d She drawled out.\u201cOh my\u2026 I guess one isn\u2019t enough now.\u201d He inserted another finger inside her, it felt fuller than before.As the two fingers moved rapidly the sounds grew louder, and her heat leaked out. Even then, it still wasn\u2019t enough for her as she wrapped her arms around his neck.It\u2019s not enough!Yes, fullness! His fullness! I need that. Quickly. Please give it to me and make me forget everything else!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Nocturnal Escapades | 19\u201cNot yet,\u201d Alexcent said in a firm voice.Amethyst looked at him with dissatisfaction. Under the moonlight peeking through the window, Alexcent\u2019s platinum hair glistened, his red eyes shone brightly, heat steamed off from his back while his lips twitched into a smile.Really he was just too sexy.Then slowly, very slowly he placed his lips on her stomach making her flinch. Before she realized what he was up to, he buried his head between her parted legs.\u201cAhh! Alec!\u201dHer back arched, head tilted backward. His teeth teasingly nibbled on her sensitive spot.His tongue licked at her as though he was quenching his thirst, all the while fingering her.She felt a mixed sensation of pain and pleasure stemming from her core. Laced under the intense rapture was an unknown urge to let go. No, it was more like wanting to let herself free.\u201cAlec\u2026 I\u2026 can\u2019t hold back any more\u2014\u201d She whispered.\u201cHold it.\u201d The raspy voice commanded.Amethyst shook her head in negation.I don\u2019t want to hold back \u2026I don\u2019t want to hold back.No, I do. I want to feel him more\u2026 But I just can\u2019t hold back anymore!Engulfed by a dilemma, unable to choose between the immense pleasure surging and the pain deep within, unable to decide on as to what to do with it all\u2026 she crumbled, surrendering, allowing it to consume her. Now, awash with intense emotions, a river of tears burst forth her dewy eyes and streamed down her flushed cheeks.\u201cSniff \u2026 sniff.\u201dFeeling the delicate body under him quiver, Alexcent came to an abrupt pause. He straightened himself and wrapped the bundle of despair in his arms.\u201cIf it\u2019s difficult to hold back then you don\u2019t have to,\u201d he whispered softly by her ears.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201dAmethyst threw a fit saying she didn\u2019t understand what he meant by not to hold back. Seeing her huff and puff, tickled him silly, he broke into a hearty laugh.\u2018When she\u2019s sobbing like this she really is too cute. I wonder if she is really na\u00efve or bold.Alexcent kissed the corner of her eyes and asked playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t understand what?\u201dWhat does he mean\u2026what? Emelis looked up at him and shook her head. She felt embarrassed to say it out loud.Alexcent then placed a hand on her lower abdomen and stroked it as he asked. \u201cHow did it feel?\u201dHis hand seemed to be asking her how it felt inside. Amethyst\u2019s face turned bright red but her lips remained shut.\u201cOkay. Then don\u2019t hold back and you can go ahead first,\u201d he said mirthfully.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Amethyst blushed brighter at his words and hit his shoulder in jest.\u201cThis time I won\u2019t stop.\u201d He declared.\u201cHmm?!\u201dIn response, Alexcent plunged himself inside her while holding her in his arms.She let out a short cry and breathed loudly as she rode him while sitting on his knees.The entire room echoed with the sound of flesh slapping flesh as love nectar seeped and added to it all. The silent night was drowned in her lustful moans and his rough breaths.Ahh \u2026 This feeling \u2026 This fullness \u2026In this moment, Amethyst was unable to differentiate anything, and as always clung onto him as she reached her limits.\u203bAs a result of the intense nocturnal escapades, Amethyst woke up later than usual.\u2018Today I shall take the walk I missed out on yesterday.\u2019 She resolutely thought to herself as she lifted her aching body with all her might. She then let the maids know she was up.Wow I must really have gotten used to being cared for\u2026. They say humans are animals of adaptability. I guess it really is true. Ah, what a different side of me \u2026After filling her tummy with the simple breakfast the mains brought, she changed into \u00a0a dress. As always, it was a comfortable loose dress. Quickly she went towards the garden of the mansion. Even though it was late in the morning, the air was still refreshing.Ha, this is nice! Nothing to do, nothing to think about \u2026 Just eating, sleeping, eating, sleeping this is true healing! And of course, the steamy nights with him!The fellow was perfect like the main character out of a fairy tale. Well, except for his sharp tongue. From a certain point somewhere, she had stopped thinking of her past as Heeyeon. She wasn\u2019t too sure why but everytime she did her head seemed to throb. So eventually, she stopped thinking about it, and now acted naturally like Amethyst.And that was how she was behaving as she started her peaceful and comfortable morning when she was brought to a halt by a scream from nearby.\u201cKyaa! Please stop!\u201dWhat is this? It\u2019s a woman shouting! Amethyst headed towards the scream.A few knights were surrounding a maid and laughing.\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean please! We just want to play for a while so stop being so rigid.\u201d\u201cPlease no \u2026. don\u2019t do this.\u201d The maid earnestly pleaded\u201cWhat do you mean no? We know you all want to seduce a knight and live a better life, so don\u2019t put up a front!\u201d\u201cI\u2026.never!\u201d\u201cHahahaha! This one\u2019s pretty cute acting naive and all!\u201d One of the knights touched the maids ass and played around.The frightened maid tried to run away but the knights blocked and cornered her. From the looks of it, it really felt like something was about to happen. The maid screamed in fear and despair as she felt panicked.Ha, what should I do. I made it clear that I won\u2019t interfere with the things that happen in the mansion.A year from now she would no longer be the wife of the duke, so she had been trying hard to ignore all that was happening within the mansion so she could keep her side of the contract. She believed she should live as quietly as possible and disappear as quietly as possible. And in order to do so, she had to live like a ghost. This was why she spent her time isolated in the mansion and declined all sorts of social invitations. It was a decision she had made for her near future.What\u2019s more, she had even pretended to not care when Pon and Lunia informed her of her duties as the duke\u2019s wife, and had pushed them away. But this time it was something she simply couldn\u2019t ignore\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Amethyst contemplated for a while but she just couldn\u2019t stand by and do nothing. In the end, she headed towards their direction in the most authoritative manner.\u201cWhat is all this ruckus?\u201d She demanded when she got the scene.The knights withdrew their hands that had been harassing the maid and looked at Amethyst. They clearly appeared shocked.\u201cMa \u2026madam, it is nothing.\u201dThey are not the knights I met before. Well of course they were the top of the ranks and wouldn\u2019t be doing something like this. Then these people must be below them.\u201cIf it\u2019s nothing then why is that young lady crying?\u201d she said, pointing towards the sobbing maid.\u201cHahah, it\u2019s because she likes it. Right?\u201d The knight looked at the maid threateningly.The maid seemed to understand what the situation meant. If she claimed that it wasn\u2019t true she would need to pay a bigger price in the future. The maid continued to cower and tremble in fear as she barely managed a nod.A frown formed on Amethyst\u2019s forehead. \u201cShe likes it\u2026 I see. I must be mistaken then.\u201dSaying so she moved slowly towards the knights, and stood right in front of the one who had just been harassing the maid. Then, without a warning, reached and grabbed the knight\u2019s bottom with a hand.\u201cArgh! Ma\u2026madam!\u201d\u201cMadam!\u201dThe remaining knights and the sniffling maid were shocked; dumbstruck they looked at the duke\u2019s newly wedded wife.\u201cWhy? You said she likes it right? I was only doing the same? Did it offend you?\u201d Amethyst levelled her gaze at the man.The knight spoke with a flushed face, \u201cMa\u2026.madam you are a noble lady! Such acts are very\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat? Rude? Wrong?\u201d She retorted.\u201cBoth!\u201d the knight hurriedly replied.\u201cWhy? It\u2019s right for a man to harass a woman, but not right if a woman haresses a man?\u201dThe man was gobsmacked but soon managed to say, \u201cWell\u2026.! It\u2019s different!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so different!\u201d As Amethyst raised her voice suddenly, the knights flinched.\u201cDo you want to make women weaker than you kneel and beg since you are stronger than them? Why? Because they are weak? If they don\u2019t have any power, does that mean you can treat them poorly? If that\u2019s the case, then I truly haven\u2019t done anything wrong have I? I\u2019m sure you are not ignorant to be unable to differentiate between something someone likes and dislikes.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2014\u201dThe knight must have felt flustered as he scratched his head.\u201cIf you harass or bully a woman again, and can\u2019t differentiate between what they like and dislike, and if a knight, who should be protecting the weak bullies others again \u2026 I will deprive you of your knighthood!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cDo you think I won\u2019t be able to do that? I have the power and influence to do so!\u201dI wonder where my courage has stemmed from. It might be because of something I had heard in passing.\u201cAside from the Emperor, you are the highest ranked woman in the Sehar empire!\u201dThe threat must have worked as the knights stood around awkwardly.\u201cWhy are you standing around like that for? Where\u2019s my answer.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Yes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ever forget that I am always watching you!\u201d Amethyst finally looked at the maid and said, \u201cYou, follow me.\u201d\u201cYes \u2026 Madam.\u201dShe left the knights behind and walked on, then turned her head back slightly. She pointed a finger at them and gestured with two fingers that she will always be watching, and then drew her index finger across her neck as if saying \u2026\u2018I am watching you, you break the promise, you\u2019re dead.\u2019Ah, I\u2019d always wanted to try this gesture on my boss but it seems like I\u2019m using it like this.Amethyst turned her head back and looked at the maid. She was still trembling and all tensed up.Of course she is in shock. And scared. And also \u2026. embarrassed. I\u2019m sure these kinds of things happen. This too is a society, and such things can happen when and wherever.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cSorry? Yes, Madam. Th-thank you.\u201dIt was a simple question, but the maid must have been very surprised as she burst into tears.\u201cOh dear\u2014 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m so sorry. I just\u2014 \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201dAmethyst hugged the maid gently and patted her back. Then slowly the girl seemed to calm down.\u201cMadam\u2026.I am fine now.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dShe took a look at the maid who was stepping away from her, then grimaced as she caught sight of her sleeve. A sleeve could get tattered from working but hers was too much.\u201cThen\u2026I will go back now. I still have things to do\u2014 \u201d\u201cAll right. Then go back for now. But if something like this happens again, you must inform me immediately! All right?\u201d\u201cYo \u2026 you?\u201d The maid was startled.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cBut \u2026that is\u2014 \u201dAmethyst smiled at the maid who was hesitating.She finally came to a realization and said, \u201cYes\u2026.I will. Madam, thank you so much for today.\u201d\u201cGo on. I realised I have something to do.\u201d She urged her on, still wearing a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d The maid bowed her head and then returned, while Amethyst quickly returned to the mansion.Amethyst who had entered the mansion started calling out loud to the butler who wasn\u2019t visible in her line of sight these days. \u201cPon, Pon!\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dPon, who had been obeying Alexcent\u2019s direct orders to stay out of Amethyst\u2019s sight, appeared as the mistress looked around for him. Even though it was the duke\u2019s orders, he could not ignore things when it came to the affairs of the mansion. So he had been trying his best to carry out his business without getting in her way.\u201cPon, assemble all the maids who work in the mansion immediately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Without asking any question, Pon did as he was told.One, two, slowly the maids of the mansion started to appear. The maid she had met today didn\u2019t appear, but Amethyst started studying each and every one of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48As she took in the assembled entourage, she recognized the maids that tended to her every day. And then there were those she saw on rotation in the evening. They all stood upright and in a row.\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot.\u201d\u201cNormally the manpower averages around this much, Madam.\u201d Pon politely filled her in.\u201cI see.\u201dWell, I suppose the main mansion is pretty large, so to clean it they must require many. Amethyst slowly observed each of them from head to toe. As expected\u2026.! They are different from the maid I met earlier on.She paid close attention to the sleeves of the maids. It\u2019s the same. The uniform is the same but\u2026 Why are the clothes on this maid and the maid before so different?The maid she had met earlier had extremely frayed sleeves. The hem of her skirt seemed to have been patched up several times as well. Whereas the clothes of the maids that worked in the main mansion appeared brand new. To think that there would be such a big difference even in the same clothes.All the maids in front of her were the same as the first one she had inspected. After a while, she said, \u201cThank you, everyone. You are all busy, you may return to your duties now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The maids chorused.They tilted their heads and looked at one other as they didn\u2019t know the reason the new mistress had summoned them. Even though they were curious, none put much thought into it as the lady of the house had always acted in a rather peculiar manner, unlike a noble lady.\u201cPon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d\u201cAre you the one in charge of the employees in the main mansion?\u201d\u201cYes. That is correct, Madam.\u201d\u201cThen what about the side mansion?\u201d\u201cOh, I am not in charge of them. The ones outside of the main mansion are being managed by Dajal. I\u2019m afraid it is too much for me to manage on my own,\u201d he truthfully replied.\u201cI suppose that is true. Even those within are so many. Sorry, did you say Dajal?\u201dIt sounded like a name she had heard before, but she couldn\u2019t place a finger on it.\u201cYes. He used to manage this place even before the duke became the master and has served generations of the Skad family.\u201d\u201cI see. Then how many years has it been since you\u2019ve started working here? Did you come here with Alec as he became the duke?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve served His Highness since he was young. We moved after he received the title of Duke, it must be 7~8 years now.\u201d\u201cHmmm \u2026 I see. Thank you.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure. Please call on me if you need anything else,\u201d Pon sincerely said.\u201cYes. I will.\u201dAmethyst was lost in her thoughts as she made her way back to her bedroom. Since Pon had moved in with Alexcent, and Dajal was in-charge of the affairs outside of the main mansion, it meant the butler was not involved or aware.I didn\u2019t see the maid I saw earlier amongst the others working in the main mansion. So I suppose she is a maid that works outside of the main mansion. I suppose her clothes are a big proof. None of the maids in the mansion were wearing clothes of such a poor state.But that maid just now\u2026It had been frayed to the extent that it was hard to believe that they were the same livery. Even her hand had been rough and full of scars, whereas those in the mansion, although their hands weren\u2019t saved from the work, were not as bad as hers.Something\u2026 smells fishy.I wonder why I have an instinct for these things. I guess I must have watched too much CSI.As Amethyst entered her bedroom her head was caught in her chain of thoughts.Dajal \u2026 Dajal, huh \u2026 his name already sounds fishy.Sigh, but I promised not to get involved.I shall not get involved!But that maid \u2026 ah, she worries me.Thinking back to the group of knights that had sexually harassed the maid, she was reminded of her first job and the very first team-lead.At the very start of her work life, her first boss was the worst person ever. He would use his authority and title to bully female employees and was the kind you never wanted to meet ever again. He was especially cruel towards her who was new to the work atmosphere and taking her first steps.Dammit \u2026 I am going overboard. But my curiosity is just driving me crazy!In her bedroom, Amethyst walked around in circles then finally went out. Just as she exited her room she ran into Lunia.\u201cMadam, where are you going?\u201d she asked politely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49\u201cMm, that is, just somewhere\u2014 \u201d\u201cWhere, Madam?\u201d She reiterated.\u201c\u2014\u201dSeeing Amethyst\u2019s reluctance to divulge, Lunia was piqued and she badgered on. \u201cMadam? You lay all your work on me and now where are you headed?\u201d\u201cWell, I just wanted to check on the dormitory of the maids who work in the side mansion.\u201dSurprised by the unexpected reply, Lunia asked, \u201cWhy do you want to go there?\u201d\u201cI just have something to enquire\u2026\u201d\u201cThen let me escort you. I will guide you there.\u201d This was the only way to quell her curiosity she reckoned.\u201cAren\u2019t you busy Lunia?\u201d\u201cNo. Today I am not.\u201d\u201cThen okay. Let\u2019s go together. But please keep it a secret.\u201d Amethyst promptly requested.\u201cA secret?\u201d Lunia was puzzled.\u201cYes. I just want to enquire something discreetly.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dLunia was amused by how her mistress was acting all mysterious. She couldn\u2019t help the smile on her face and soon the two broke into a hearty laugh and were on their way.Amethyst was able to carry out this secret mission as she had always enjoyed being alone. Her maids did not pester her unless she seeked them out, and they must have gotten used to her as they no longer followed her around and stood guard. So she was able to roam around more freely than she could back home in the count\u2019s house. As such, she enjoyed taking strolls wherever she pleased.Back at the count\u2019s, Yellie had followed her like a shadow and pestered incessantly. This was one of the reasons she had left her behind. She had Lunia with her now.At the moment, she was able to exit the main mansion unnoticed and head towards the side mansion.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s here.\u201dOh, my godness!The other building that was far off from the main mansion looked like a haunted house. Lunia too seemed surprised, but carefully opened the door for her. For the first time, Amethyst felt relieved to have been in someone\u2019s company as she entered the building.Once inside, she met a few maids who were resting.\u201cMy goodness! Madam?! What brings you to a place like this\u2026!\u201d\u201cI hope I am not disturbing your rest?\u201d Amethyst said with a smile.\u201cWhat?! Oh no, not all!\u201dThe maids quickly stood up and bowed. \u201cWhat brings you all the way here Madam?\u201d\u201cMay I take a look around?\u201dThe maids seemed taken aback by her question.\u201cIt will only be a while.\u201d Amethyst added, noticing their hesitation.\u201cYou need not ask for our permission Madam.\u201d The maids bowed in response to Lunia\u2019s words.\u201cEven so\u2014 \u201d\u201cYes, Madam. Please don\u2019t mind us and take your time to look around,\u201d One of the maids hurriedly said.\u201cAll right then thank you, please pardon my intrusion.\u201d Amethyst gestured to the maids who were still bowing to stand comfortably and took a look around.The wallpapers were tearing off the wall and smudged. There were several cracks where wind was blowing in from making the entire building cold. The furniture being used by the maids were either broken or damaged, nothing was whole. It was a much poorer environment than she had imagined.Amethyst\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cMay I open the drawer?\u201dOne of the maids nodded.Amethyst was able to open the drawer albeit with Lunia\u2019s help. She found clothes that appeared to be their uniforms but even these were not in a good state. They were full of patchwork and yellow stained sleeves. In her past life, she had washed and ironed collared shirts every day, so she was well aware of how old these clothes must have been to be this way. She couldn\u2019t help but sigh out loud.She left the creaking drawer behind and looked around at the bedroom. A deep frown etched her face. She looked around before approaching the maids again.\u201cLet me see your hands,\u201d said she.\u201cSorry?\u201d The maid was dumbfounded by the request.\u201cQuickly.\u201dAt her words, the maid wasted no time and held her hands up while awash with embarrassment.As expected, even this maid\u2019s hands were covered in scars. What was going on?! Was the work in the mansion this rough and hard? It couldn\u2019t be \u2026 If so then the state of the maids in the main mansion should have been similar.\u2018Everything from here to there \u2026 no, in fact, send everything to the mansion. Including the ones that my wife is holding.\u2019Momentarily, Alexcent\u2019s words popped up in her head. Thinking back to his behaviour in Newhenfiled, he was not someone who would let something like this be. This only meant neither Pon nor Alexcent was aware of this.So, is Dajal the root cause of the problem?Amethyst turned her gaze back to the maids.Lunia too must have been surprised by the state of their living quarters as she questioned aloud. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d\u201c\u2014 \u201d\u201cFrom what I know, I believe the cost for maintenance, utilities, accommodation is paid every month\u2026so why!\u201d\u201cEvery month?\u201d Amethyst raised an eyebrow.\u201cYes, Madam. On the first day of every month, from what I know, they are sent the money for maintenance, the upkeep and accommodation of the maids, and other miscellaneous things they may need.\u201dAt Lunia\u2019s words, Amethyst turned to look at the maids. The maids whose eyes met with the lady of the house could only look down and keep silent.Then the youngest looking maid braved it. \u201c\u2014 We weren\u2019t even aware that there was money sent every month.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Someone gestured to her, she instantly shut up leaving Amethyst\u2019s question unanswered.Nobody seemed to be willing to speak up, so Amethyst tried to fish out the information. \u201cWell, this leaves me no choice. Since you weren\u2019t aware, I must punish you all for embezzlement.\u201d\u201cMadam! Please we know nothing about it!\u201d The few maids chorused.\u201cThis place is too worn down for you to be unaware.\u201d Amethyst sniggered.\u201cWe only know that the person in charge of this place is Sir Dajal.\u201d The most flustered one blurted out.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Even when we raised a request for maintenance he said that there were no funds \u2026 \u201d said another.\u201cIf not he would just brush us off and ignore us\u2014 \u201dThe word punishment must have scared them. As each of the maids added on to the other.So it really must be Dajal. Unless these ladies are lying \u2026 She couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion without gathering the facts and evidence, but something was fishy for sure. A woman\u2019s intuition is never wrong!\u201cI am not here to punish you all. I am here to help. If you do not tell me the truth then I cannot help you.\u201d She declared.\u201cYou will help us?!\u201d The maids thought they had misheard. No one had been bothered about their plight until now, so one couldn\u2019t blame them for being skeptical.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to.\u201d Someone dared to be forthright.\u201cWhy\u2026 do you think that?\u201d Amethyst was surprised.\u201cYou can only say that because you don\u2019t know Sir Dajal.\u201d There was some resentment and resignation in the voice.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAt first\u2026we weren\u2019t always like this.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWe tried to protest and rebuked but\u2014 \u201dNoticing the hesitation, Amethyst urged on. \u201cOh my\u2026. please tell me what happened in detail.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2014 \u201dAmethyst smiled compassionately and laid bare the truth of the matter. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t trust me yet because I am new to this place, but I don\u2019t think telling me what happened will put you in any situation worse than it is now.\u201dThe maids only looked at one another as if trying to come to a decision. Then finally the oldest of the lot opened her mouth.\u201cMadam, my name is Roman.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss Roman. Please can you tell me what happened?\u201d\u201cBefore I begin, I must tell you I\u2019ve worked here, body and soul, for the last 10 years,\u201d Roman said with feeling.\u201cI see. You\u2019ve worked for quite some time.\u201d Amethyst politely remarked.\u201cYes, Madam. When I first had my interview here, I had several batch mates. But now they all work in the main house.\u201dAmethyst acknowledged with a nod, urging her to continue.\u201cThe only factor that determines whether you work here or in the main house is money. I only found out later that the amount of work you get corresponds to the amount of money you bribe the interviewer with. And the interviewer is Sir Dajal. If he is unsatisfied with the amount he receives, he deducts it from that month\u2019s pay or allocates you to a different work location.Bribery. Ha, to think that such things exist even in this place!Amethyst felt her blood boil \u2026 No matter where it was all the same!\u201cSo according to you, that bastar\u2026 no, Dajal receives bribes and exercises his authority on personnel transfer.\u201d\u201cYes. Not only that but he is also embezzling all the money sent for the monthly maintenance, clothing, and accommodation.\u201d\u201cIt seems to be the case. Just by looking at the situation here\u2026 but why hasn\u2019t anybody said anything? That\u2019s what I\u2019m more curious about.\u201dA frown formed on Roman\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t help wonder \u2026 Was she another typical noble lady? Just how much would she be able to help us? Can we trust her?Since she had come all the way to visit them out here, she decided to bet on the small glimmer of hope.\u201cWe did.\u201d\u201cYou did?!\u201d Amethyst was taken aback. \u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cA year since coming here, a friend I had been working with couldn\u2019t tolerate it any longer and spoke to the higher-ups. But\u2026 the lord chose to believe Sir Dajal\u2019s words over us. Then Sir Dajal\u2026 fabricated a story, said she was an immoral woman and incriminating her as a thief who stole and sold goods from a noble family. He whipped and punished her until eventually kicking her out\u2026 And my friend\u2026 no longer could stand the injustice\u2026 and took her own life\u2014\u201dRoman seemed to recall this incident from a decade ago as though it was something that had happened only yesterday. As such, she was unable to continue any further.If it happened ten years ago, then it was definitely before Alexcent had become the owner of the mansion.\u201cWhat a bloody piece of trash!\u201d\u201cMadam?!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t stop myself\u2014\u201dLunia and the maids seemed astounded as they had never expected such words from a noblewoman and looked at her blankly. Amethyst blushed and apologized.Yet another maid seemed to have gained the courage and started to add on.\u201cMadam, actually that is not all.\u201d\u201cIs there something else?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51A vein popped up in Amethyst\u2019s forehead but disappeared in a flash.Another maid took off her outerwear. There were bruises on her arm, chest, stomach, and various other places. It differed from bruises that appeared quite old to new bluish ones. The sizes varied as well.\u201cOh my goodness! Did he beat you?\u201dThe maid put back her clothes and nodded.\u201cThis crazy bastard I will rip off his head.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2014\u201dThis time Lunia, who had been passive all this while, stepped in to stop her from swearing any further. She too thought Dajal was a bastard. To think that the man who had long been considered a loyalist of the Skad family, was in fact putting up an act before the prince and his aides while hiding his ugly true colors. And the fact that she hadn\u2019t realised made her mad.\u201cHe threatened to kill us if we reported it to the higher-ups \u2026 and, and\u2014\u201dThe maid trembled in shame.\u201c\u2014Did he violate you as well?\u201d asked Amethyst, no longer able to suppress her anger watching the maid unable to complete her sentence.The silence was enough for an answer.\u201cMy goodness\u2014!\u201d\u201cRecently we saw a maid who was impregnated and chased out.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s clenched fists started to shake with rage.What should I do with this piece of trash that deserves to be burnt in hell!Even though she felt like grabbing him by the collar and slapping him continuously, now was not the time. She was well aware that getting emotional in such situations was not helpful at all for she had experienced similar situations for a decade as a working adult \u2026Real occurrences where victims become perpetrators of false accusations. In the end, those vulnerable were the ones to receive punishment and appointed to the provinces, or placed on suspension or even asked to leave. Just like the maids in front of her right now \u2026Ha, I need to hold back. Let\u2019s hold back for now. Right now there\u2019s something else that is more important. Evidence, I need to find evidence.But how? Here they don\u2019t have any CCTV cameras or voice recorders!What should I do? I can\u2019t think straight\u2026.Right now she knew she would deal with things emotionally. I should go back and think about it calmly.\u201cI know\u2026 how this might sound to you right now, which is why I don\u2019t want to say it\u2014\u201d Amethyst chose her words carefully and spoke slowly. \u201cTrust me and wait for me.\u201d\u201c\u2014Madam?!\u201d\u201cAs you might already know, Dajal is a very agile and cautious man, so if I were to act rashly it may only end up harming you all more. So please, just hold on a little until I come up with a solution!\u201d Amethyst grabbed ahold of their hands to express solidarity. \u201cI won\u2019t\u2026 make you wait for long. I will definitely catch that bastard and beat the shit out of him! So please hold out just a little more.\u201dRather than being furious about wanting to take Dajal\u2019s neck right away like before, her calm and collected plea bought the sincerity of the maids. Because of that, they nodded in unison as they shed tears that they had held back for so long.Amethyst returned to the residence with a heavy heart and ordered Lunia to keep today\u2019s happenings a secret. The latter readily agreed to follow her mistress\u2019s will and solemnly promised she would try to come up with solutions of her own before going back to her duties.All alone now, Amethyst sat at a table and fell into her dilemma.To catch Dajal she needed proof. Of course, she could have the maids come forward and testify\u2026 but she knew how hard it was for victims, especially those that had been sexually assaulted, to testify for themselves which was why she didn\u2019t want to make them do such a thing.Ha. I really wish there was a CCTV. Or at least a voice recorder.Well\u2026 even if I had a CCTV or a voice recorder, what\u2019s the point.Those things would not be of much use anyways because those with power always found a way to get away one way or the other. Furthermore, if he was someone who had gotten his way thus far, he would be sure to retaliate and try to turn the tables.If so, to what extent would Alec believe me? How far would he go to support me? He\u2019s barely spent a month with me \u2026With Dajal, they have had a history of seven years. It was a past that couldn\u2019t be ignored which was why she couldn\u2019t dismiss his loyalty without any proof. As compared to him, she may be the wife of a duke but it was time-bound. She didn\u2019t know how far she could get involved either. Even if she tried to fire him for valid reasons, she would need enough evidence to substantiate her claim. So if she was able to gather evidence and fire him, Alec might support her decision.I guess that is the only way? \u2026 I should get involved directly.Thankfully the maids in the main mansion were not concerned about her whereabouts, so it would make things simpler.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52These days, Alec seemed very busy which came as a relief to Amethyst.She quickly left the mansion and went to the building where Roman and the others were.\u201cGood morning!\u201d\u201cMadam! What brings you here so early in the morning?\u201dThe maids were quite surprised to see their mistress here.\u201cWell\u2026 I couldn\u2019t think of any other solution than this.\u201d Amethyst declared somewhat resignedly.\u201cAny other solution\u2014?\u201d\u201cIs anyone not feeling well? Or does anyone want to take a day off today?\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly asking such a thing?\u201d One of the maids voiced everyone\u2019s puzzlement.\u201cI\u2019ll work on your behalf.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d They cried in unison. Then one of them said, \u201cWhat do you mean! Why would Madam\u2014!\u201d\u201cThis is all to catch that bastar\u2026no Dajal. This is a disguise of sorts, going undercover!\u201dThe maids looked at her blankly so Amethyst explained calmly.\u201cWell, you know there is a saying\u2026 to catch a tiger you need to go into the tiger\u2019s cave.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d The room echoed with the chorus yet again.\u201cHaha, I guess you wouldn\u2019t know. So basically I will reveal all of Dajal\u2019s misdeeds myself.\u201d\u201cMadam! That is too dangerous! What if something happened to you\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Before that, I will oof! Beat the shit out of him first.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf it isn\u2019t me then there is no justification to punish him. As you know he is a pro at making excuses. Even if I were to make all of you testify against him, he will find a way to escape. But with me as the \u2018victim\u2019, it\u2019ll be different. Even though I may appear so, I am still a noble lady \u2026 so getting revenge might be hard but firing him should be doable. So, cooperate with me.\u201dThe maids stared at her with mouths wide open. They had heard in passing from the maids in the mansion that the new lady of the house was peculiar but to think she was to this extent \u2026Roman stood rooted to the ground, and the only thought in her mind was \u2018how do I stop this unstoppable lady.\u2019 \u2026On the other hand, the younger maids were of a different opinion.\u201cI will lend you my clothes! We seem to have a similar figure so it should fit you perfectly.\u201d\u201cOh my, thank you!\u201d\u201cNo, right now that\u2019s not important\u2014\u201d\u201cRoman, don\u2019t worry. You should treat me comfortably\u2026 mm\u2026 Carol, yes call me Carol.\u201d\u201cCarol\u2026.? Why Carol?\u201d\u201cIf you call me Amethyst then it will reveal my identity. So think of it as a false name.\u201dCarol\u2026 Amethyst had no idea why that name came to mind. Most probably because it was the title of the last movie she had seen.\u201cReally must you go this far? What if you were to get hurt Madam\u2026.\u201d Roman was like a cat on a hot tin roof.\u201cYou know there is no other way.\u201d Amethyst countered.\u201cBut to go this far for us\u2014\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know about it then that\u2019s one thing, but now that I know how could I possibly look past it? I have a duty to protect my people!\u201dMy people \u2026 It was the first time Roman had heard such a phrase from someone of noble standing.She swallowed hard \u2026 if the mistress was willing to go all the way out for them \u2026 \u201cThen\u2026 let me fill you in on what to be careful about. Don\u2019t ever, ever, ever be alone with Dajal.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.!\u201dSo he must be doing those things when he\u2019s alone with them. Sly scum!Amethyst nodded her head.\u201cToday we need to clean the stables. It might be difficult.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m good at cleaning,\u201d Amethyst said cheerily.\u201cHow could a noble lady like you possibly be good with cleaning?\u201d\u201cAh! Back home \u2026 my father was very humble so I cleaned my own room\u2026 and a humble lifestyle made me\u2014\u201d\u201cI see. Understood. But if it gets difficult please take a rest in between.\u201d An apprehensive Roman implored.\u201cYes.\u201d Amethyst nodded and changed into the maid uniform that Roman handed to her.It felt like she had become an otaku\u2026 no, no what did they call it? Yes, costume \u2026? Cosplay?A maid\u2019s uniform! When else would she ever wear such a thing!It was a black A-line dress that reached her ankles with a white ribbon-bound shirt collar that contrasted against the black backdrop, topping it off was a white apron. She indeed looked like a maid.With Roman\u2019s help, she tied up her long hair and hid it beneath a white bonnet. Thankfully, Amethyst was not an astonishing beauty. It was an ordinary face that could be easily forgotten. Somehow she seemed to suit the ragged maid uniform than the new dresses she put on every morning.\u201cI know it may sound rude\u2026 but\u2026 it suits you.\u201d Roman seemed to have shared her thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53\u201cHaha, you are right. Somehow I fit right in, it\u2019s making me sappy.\u201d\u201cSappy?\u201d Roman asked in puzzlement.\u201cAh, sad and happy. Well, there is a slang like that. Roman, now let\u2019s go to the stables. I\u2019m sure we can\u2019t be late.\u201d\u201cYes. Please follow me, Madam.\u201d\u201cRoman, please talk comfortably with me. We might end up getting caught like this.\u201d\u201cBu\u2026 but!\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201dAs Amethyst made a serious expression and looked at her, Roman nodded unwillingly.Smiling, the mistress continued to follow the maid\u2019s lead.\u201cDammit\u2026 I can\u2019t help but want to swear.\u201d Amethyst muttered under her breath.\u201cSorry?\u201d Roman stilled and looked at the other.\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s only the two of us that need to clean this large stable?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cLast month I didn\u2019t pay my deposit.\u201d\u201cWhat, this crazy bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026 no, Carol!\u201d Roman hurrielded exclaimed.\u201cHaha\u2026 okay. I will watch what I say.\u201dThere seemed to be no end to the stable. It seemed to be at least a few thousand square feet. This Dajal guy was definitely a psycho.Amethyst started to brush the horses angrily.\u201cErm, Carol\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cApparently a few days later they have a riding training, so we must be careful and clean without stressing the horses\u2026 if you brush roughly it will scare them Mada\u2026 scare them.\u201dRoman seemed to be having a hard time talking informally.\u201cI understand\u2026\u201dAmethyst\u2019s responses were inadvertently funny as well.That\u2019s true, what have the horses done wrong! Amethyst smiled and started to brush them gently.It felt good to do some physical labor but Dajal was nowhere to be seen even as they came to finish cleaning up the stables.\u203bAn exhausted Amethyst fell asleep after quickly finishing her dinner as she heard Alexcent would be returning late from the palace. Normally, she would wait up for him and fall asleep together. But today she dozed off the moment she lied down in bed.After getting ready to sleep and only wearing his gown, Alec looked down at Amethyst who had fallen asleep first and was mumbling away.\u201cI wonder\u2026 what she\u2019s dreaming about.\u201dHer round forehead, tightly closed two eyes and lips that were slightly ajar \u2026 She had a child-like expression in her sleep, it somehow comforted him. He looked at her longingly before bending down to bring his lips to her forehead.He caught a whiff of hay and soil, followed by the smell of horses \u2026 he automatically frowned.Then he carefully lay next to her and brushed her hair to the side. Then listening to the sound of her rough breathing, he tried to fall asleep.\u203bOh no! Due to yesterday\u2019s sudden labour I woke up later than usual.Thankfully it seemed like Alexcent had gone ahead to enter the palace. Quickly, Amethyst rushed to get ready and headed down to the side building while avoiding all the eyes around her.Roman must have been worried as she got up from her seat as she saw Amethyst hurrying in.\u201cAre you all right? You must have been tired from yesterday?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m not\u2026 but I\u2019m fine. But more than that, are you okay Roman? You worked more than me yesterday.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s normal for me.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that such unfair treatment is normal. You\u2019re breaking my heart!\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s stay strong! So, what are we doing today?\u201d Amethyst flashed a bright smile.\u201cToday we are cleaning the garden.\u201d\u201cGarden?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre we by chance\u2026 cleaning the garden that looks like terrains of huge paddy fields?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what rice paddy fields look like but if you are referring to the garden in front of the mansion then you are right\u2014\u201d\u201cIs it just you and me today as well?\u201d\u201c\u2014Yes.\u201d\u201cAh, this crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cMadam, please calm\u2014\u201d Roman hastily urged.\u201cHow can I calm down? It\u2019s not once or twice that I got lost there, so for the two of us to\u2026!\u201dRoman must have felt apologetic as she looked down at the floor. After all, it was a consequence of her not paying the deposit. So she couldn\u2019t help but feel apologetic that the mistress had to suffer along with her.\u201cRoman, let\u2019s go! You just wait and see, I will pay him back double, no triple times!\u201dAmethyst huffed and puffed as she headed to the garden together with Roman.They started to sweep and gather the fallen leaves. For today, Amethystcouldn\u2019t help but resent the wind that kept blowing their way. Thanks to it, the leaves incessantly showered making her want to chop down all the trees in the garden.Let\u2019s be patient, patient. Those that are patient will be rewarded.\u201cGah!\u201dReward my ass!Amethyst threw her broom and shouted.\u201cMa\u2026no, Carol. If you are tired please take a rest\u2026 no rest. I will finish up\u2026.\u201d Roman panicked.\u201cWhat? Do you think you\u2019re made of steel? Are you superwoman?\u201d Amethyst looked her in the eye and retorted.\u201cWhat?\u201d Roman was dumbfounded.\u201cNo, I meant you should come over here and rest as well.\u201d\u201cBut I must finish this by today,\u201d said Roman. She didn\u2019t have the liberty the other had.\u201cHa\u2026I swear I will uproot these trees.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201d\u201cWhy? Why are you laughing.\u201d Amethyst looked at the laughing maid in puzzlement.\u201cHow can the wife of the prince say such a thing? Normally you can\u2019t do all this alone.\u201d\u201cI know. It was just empty words and me ranting.\u201dWhile they were taking a breather they heard footsteps.Rustle!The sound of leaves being stepped on. It was very fast.\u201cI see you still haven\u2019t come to your senses and still have the time to rest.\u201dAs she heard a hoarse voice, Amethyst turned to look behind. It was a man neither short nor tall with a paunch, and a head with barely any hair left. Just the looks of it, and his oily forehead seemed to say \u2018I am Dajal\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54\u201cSir Dajal.\u201dAs Roman bowed to formally greet him, Amethyst followed suit as well.\u201cTsk, tsk, you better finish up by today. These days the lady of the house likes to come out to the garden.\u201dHmm, that lady of the house is right here!What an idiot that can\u2019t even recognise the lady of the house! Do you have fish eyes? No, even fish eyes are a waste.\u201cYes.\u201d Roman bowed her head and answered.Dajal clicked his tongue and turned his gaze to the one next to her. with a look that said \u2018this is the first time I\u2019ve seen this girl\u2019.As he looked at Amethyst with lustful eyes, she felt goosebumps. She simply bowed her head even further.Dajal held his gaze as he spoke to Roman in an uninterested tone.\u201cTomorrow the bedsheets in the knights\u2019 dormitories need to be changed. You know what that means?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen hurry up and finish cleaning up. And you, are you new?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh yes.\u201d Amethyst answered\u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d\u201cCa\u2026rol.\u201d\u201cCarol? It\u2019s not a familiar name.\u201d\u201cShe came from the suburbs.\u201d Roman answered in Amethyst\u2019s stead.\u201cIs it\u2026 Well, I guess you\u2019re here since I picked you as well. So pay close attention and remember what happens when you go against me.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Yes.\u201dAmethyst answered through clenched teeth. She contemplated kicking his mouth but told herself to hold it in.But what should I do\u2026 They say people hold back three times before committing murder\u2026I feel like I won\u2019t be able to hold back the next time!\u203bAfter that Dajal didn\u2019t show up again. Every day Amethyst and Roman carried out an unbelievable amount of workload, and time flew by.\u201cRoman!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLook at this.\u201dAmethyst lifted up her sleeves and flexed her arms. \u201cDo you see that? Do you see that bulge in my biceps?\u201d\u201cPfft! Madam, even if we\u2019re both women you must uphold your modesty.\u201dReally, our Madam is a true character. Even now, here, she is flashing her bare skin! Even though she is in one of the highest positions, she bows the lowest. She carried out difficult tasks even as she swore on, but is resilient.\u201cWhat are we doing today?\u201d\u201cToday\u2026 a piece of new equipment has arrived. So we will clean the commodity warehouse\u2014\u201d\u201cWe have a problem!\u201dA maid opened the door suddenly and ran in while shouting.\u201cWhy what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSi-sir Dajal is looking for Carol\u2026 looking for Madam!\u201dOh my, the time has finally arrived!Roman stood up in surprise and looked at Amethyst. \u201cMadam\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right, don\u2019t worry. In fact, it\u2019s a good thing. But it took longer than I expected. I guess I\u2019m not that charming.\u201d\u201cMadam! No I should go along with you\u2014\u201d\u201cNo. This is an opportunity. In fact, it might be the last\u2026one.\u201d\u201cBut if the Prince finds out\u2026!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 then it is a good thing\u2026.\u201dEven as she said that aloud., she couldn\u2019t help worry. Will he support me when the time comes?There was no way he would believe her. She doubted that he would act out for his wife of one year. And they had only spent a month together so far so how could she win over a relationship of seven years?Until I find solid proof I must do my utmost. She told herself firmly but could feel her fingers turning cold.Then, Amethyst smiled at Roman and left.\u203bShe stood outside a smaller building but that seemed to have no damages like the one she had come from. It seemed to be the space used by Dajal.A space used by himself\u2026She felt her shoulders tense up.Knock, knock!She knocked before opening the door and entered the office. Surprisingly it was neat. The interior was modest and nothing appeared extravagant to the eyes.Tsk, just how much money is he hiding? I bet this too is to trick others.Then the balding man with his bulging tummy came into view.But why is this man only dressed in a gown?Even as these thoughts ran in her mind, due to the time she had spent with Roman she automatically bowed to greet him.\u201cYou sent for me Sir Dajal?\u201d\u201cWas it Carol?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe girl I\u2019ve been calling wasn\u2019t to my liking\u2026.\u201dThe girl he has been calling? He must have gotten sick of her!\u201cFrom today on I want you to be in charge of cleaning this place.\u201c\u2014 Yes.\u201dHa! What to do?!\u201cRight now I would like you to clean the living room. The girl before wasn\u2019t meticulous and I spotted many dusty areas.\u201cYes.\u201dSurprisingly he\u2019s pretty neat. Even though he looked like he would be dirty and messy.Amethyst quickly went to grab a bucket of water and started to mop the place. Everytime she mopped her body moved, and Dajal stared at her from the sofa in the living room. His filthy gaze followed her around.Perhaps it was due to the closed window, or from moving around, her body felt hot and she felt suffocated. Drops of sweat formed on her forehead, and the ribbon around her neck added onto the heat.Amethyst loosened the ribbon around her neck. She could breathe a little better but she still felt warm. She could feel the sweat on her and the disgusting gaze that followed her.By the time the living room was mopped, a fair bit of time had passed by. She held her hands tightly together out of nervousness. It was time to go back. If she was even slightly late, people would start looking for her. Also Alec would be returning.\u201cErm, Sir Dajal\u2026 I have finished.\u201dDajal slowly got up from the sofa and started to walk over to her side of the living room.Gulp! Amethyst swallowed hardDajal swiped a finger on the bookshelf she had last cleaned and looked around. Then he bent over and whispered in her ear.\u201cIt\u2019s clean. I like it. Good work today, I will see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir Dajal.\u201dAmethyst tried to bow as politely as possible and left his office.Yucks, that perverted bastard! My ear\u2026I want to wash my ear! Amethyst rubbed her ear in disgust. But soon she slowed down. I\u2019m sure Dajal is testing waters. I must be more careful from now on.She quickly changed out and headed back to the main mansion. Even then, Alexcent had not yet returned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55\u201cSir Dajal, it\u2019s Carol.\u201d Amethyst greeted as she entered his building, but the only response she received was silence. \u201cMay I begin my duties?\u201dThere were no signs of anyone being here, and she didn\u2019t feel Dajals\u2019 unpleasant gaze on her either.Perhaps he\u2019s gone out \u2026 That\u2019s good. I should look for evidence while he\u2019s not around.Hoping that she could find something in his absence, she entered a room that appeared to be his study. Just in case, she didn\u2019t forget to bring along the bucket, rag, and broom.She placed the bucket and the broom by the door and looked around with the rag in hand. She didn\u2019t forget to pay attention to the door lest he return.Thump! Thump! Thump!Her heart was beating rapidly. She tried to calm the throbbing that felt like it were a time bomb about to explode.Generally, the study was well kept. On top of his desk were neatly arranged files of account statements. She picked up the files and flipped through them.[Waterproofing of roof, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.][Planting of trees, Amoz Corporation, Marcezon Bank to be paid.][Painting works, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.][Repairing of walls, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.]Once the repair is completed by the subcontracted company, payment is made by the bank.\u203bQuotation, repair details, repair confirmation, invoice, payment confirmation. It was a very well-organised account. It looked perfect. And this was precisely that made it even more suspicious. Except for the tree plantation, all of the work was commissioned to Dijon Corporation and payment was made by Aran Bank.Well, if Dijon Corporation was a company that provided good service, then it was understandable. But given the size and scale of the mansion, it isn\u2019t possible.Also since it\u2019s a construction fee, it would require a large amount of money going back and forth, so it would be natural to use the bank rather than cash\u2026But why would they choose this bank? Was it the partnered bank of the prince\u2019s estate?I think it will be faster to look into Aran bank than Dijon Corporation.The fact that Dajal was commissioning all the work solely to Dijon Corporation, suggested that they had a close relationship. And if the two were in a transactional relationship, acting rashly could reveal that they were under scrutiny. Also, she had a hunch that the slush funds and Aran Bank had some sort of a link.All right, there\u2019s a need to look into this first.Amethyst placed the files back in their original position, picked up the bucket and broom she had placed by the door, and exited the study. Since Dajal was nowhere in sight, she returned to the building where the maids were quartered.As she entered the building, she saw Roman massaging her shoulders while seated in an old chair.\u201cRoman! Are you taking a rest?\u201d\u201cMadam! Are you all right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cI was so worried.\u201d She must have been worried since the time she left for Dajal\u2019s office yesterday.\u201cToday I didn\u2019t see Dajal.\u201d\u201cAh, once a week he goes out. Today must be the day.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Once a week? By chance do you know where he goes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that\u2026,\u201d said Roman shaking her head.I wonder where he goes once a week. Is it to Aran Bank? Or Dijon Corporation? Amethyst ruminated for a moment before asking Roman for a favour. \u201cI see. Also, tomorrow I might not be able to come. So if Dajal looks for me could you tell him I am on leave?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. All right. Are you by chance not feeling well or\u2026?\u201d Roman asked with a worried tone.Amethyst laughed and reassured her. \u201cNot at all! I\u2019m just being cautious in case I raise the suspicions of others. So don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dAssuming that Dajal wouldn\u2019t look for her today since he was out, Amethyst retired early to the main mansion and looked for Pon.\u201cPon.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d\u201cWhich bank is affiliated with the mansion?\u201dPon seemed taken aback by the sudden question and answered her by way of a question. \u201cMadam, may I enquire which affiliated bank you are looking for?\u201d\u201cWhich\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, Madam. In the mansion, we use different banks for different businesses.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. There are several banks owned by His Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cSeveral?\u201d\u201cYes. So depending on the nature of business the banks we use differ.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 see.\u201dHahaha. This is incredible! I knew Alec wasn\u2019t just some gold spoon\u2026 but to think he was a Vibranium spoon!\u201cThen is Aran Bank also owned by Alec?\u201d\u201cNo. As far as I am aware.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dPhew\u2026 that\u2019s a relief!I wonder why I\u2019m relieved that it\u2019s not owned by him. Perhaps because it means he has nothing to do with this \u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why?For now, I need to find out more on Aran Bank.And she knew just the person to ask about it. \u201cPon, tomorrow I\u2019m thinking of visiting my family. I miss my mother.\u201d\u201cYes. I will make the arrangements.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dReturning to her bedroom, Amethyst took a bath before settling herself on her bed. She decided to stay up until Alexcent came home, but her fatigue got the better of her and she soon fell asleep.In the middle of the night, Alexcent lay next to her to sleep.She used to get up even at the slightest sound. But these last few days she was dead asleep and wouldn\u2019t know even if someone were to carry her away. And he didn\u2019t like that.Well, I\u2019ll just wait and observe for a little longer.Sighing he breathed in her warm scent.As he breathed in the familiar and foreign scent, he swore under his breath and pulled her closer as he too fell into deep oblivion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56\u201cYoung Miss!\u201dAs Amethyst descended the carriage, Yellie greeted her loudly.\u201cYellie, watch your manners. She is now the wife of the prince.\u201d\u201cAh, I am so sorry. I was just so happy to see her\u2026.\u201d Yellie flushed as the butler of the count\u2019s mansion reprimanded her, but she didn\u2019t appear apologetic at all.\u201cHuhu, it\u2019s fine. And that\u2019s Yellie\u2019s charm. How have you been? Your complexion seems better. I guess you\u2019re enjoying my absence?\u201d\u201cNo way! I cried so much because you threw me away and left me behind.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean threw you away \u2026 Some people might think it\u2019s true!\u201d\u201cIt is true! I at least thought you would take me along with you!\u201d\u201cThat again? I already told you I can\u2019t bring anybody into the mansion due to security reasons.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not anybody.\u201d Yellie pouted.Amethyst tried to come up with various reasons to soothe her, but her grudge seemed to hold.As the two continued on and on at the front door, the butler stepped in.\u201cWelcome back Lady Skad.\u201d\u201cThank you. Is mother inside?\u201d\u201cYes. She has been waiting for you.\u201dAh, Pon said he would make the arrangements so he must have informed them.It was a place she had left after spending only a couple of days, but seeing how happy Yellie was to see her, it felt like home.Leaving the sad Yellie behind, she followed the butler to the count\u2019s drawing-room.\u201cWelcome, Amethyst.\u201d\u201cMother.\u201dCountess Lohikin who had the same coloured hair as her daughter greeted her with a smile. Subconsciously she approached Countess Lohikin and embraced her. It felt warm and nice.\u201cI was surprised by the sudden message. By chance did you fight with the prince?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief\u2026.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you go to work today?\u201d\u201cHow could I when my daughter is coming over to visit?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 you must be busy.\u201d\u201cNo worries, no worries at all. Now look at you, you\u2019ve become prettier!\u201d\u201cHaha, I doubt it.\u201dCountess Lohikin grabbed a hold of Amethyst\u2019s hand and patted it. As she could feel the concern and care of the mother who had sent her daughter off to get married, she couldn\u2019t help but feel bad.Maybe I should have visited more frequently\u2026No, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t become weak here.\u201cSo how is your newlywed period? Seeing how you\u2019ve become prettier\u2026 I\u2019m guessing the Prince is treating you well.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dHow should I respond\u2026 Amethyst\u2019s face flushed. That he is treating super well? No, I think that only applies to the events that happen at night.\u201cHuhu, seeing how you are all flushed\u2026 it seems like you\u2019re well.\u201d\u201cMother, that\u2019s not it\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Mother knows. No need to be shy.\u201dHaha. Of course. I\u2019m sure you know!I better change the topic. I can\u2019t hide from the elders. At this rate, I might end up giving away all the details!\u201cActually, I wanted to visit you because\u2026 I have something to ask.\u201d\u201cReally? What is my dear daughter curious about?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Have you heard of Aran Bank?\u201dCountess Lohikin carefully studied Amethyst\u2019s face. She had expected her na\u00efve daughter to have questions about married life but to think that her question was on Aran Bank\u2026 She couldn\u2019t help but feel concerned whether she was in urgent need of money.\u201cAmethyst, do you secretly have a debt with the prince?\u201d\u201cWhat? No!\u201d\u201cThen why are you suddenly asking about Aran Bank?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve been working on the management of the mansion and Aran Bank stood out. There were other banks too\u2026 but based on the butler I heard that this bank was not affiliated with the mansion.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cThat you found out about Aran Bank while managing the mansion?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s true. I saw that Aran Bank had paid for fixes and repairs.\u201dAmethyst felt nervous as Countess Lohikin turned solemn.Did I\u2026 say something wrong? No matter how odd and sudden her question about Aran Bank was, the other looked too serious and tense.\u201cPhew! All right then that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cYou scared me for a minute there! I thought you owed a big debt\u2026 but hold on! It\u2019s weird that a place like the Prince\u2019s Mansion would be affiliated with a place like Aran Bank\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy so?\u201d\u201cBecause Aran Bank is famously known for creating borrowed-name accounts or secret accounts in this field.\u201d\u201cA borrowed-name account?\u201d Amethyst was visibly surprised.\u201cYes. It\u2019s a place where black money comes and goes, such as slush funds and hidden assets\u2026 There must be a lot of banks owned by the Skad family, so I wonder why they are affiliated with them\u2026 I must say it is rather worrisome.\u201d\u201cI see. Slush funds and hidden assets \u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, so it may appear to be a bank\u2026 but it\u2019s famous for creating a separate special law and not disclosing their financial details.\u201d Countess Lohikin explained.\u201cAre banks allowed to do that?\u201d Amethyst queried.\u201cExactly. I was surprised to hear that they had been approved. But after them, there were no other banks that passed the bill, but it certainly is a legitimate bank that complies with the federal laws of the empire.\u201dHmm. So I guess that means Aran Bank is the only option, which must be why Dajal chose it.\u201cSince we are on the topic, there are three banks you must never ever make deals or be associated with.\u201d\u201cThree?\u201d Her eyebrows quirked.\u201cYes. Aran, Deutsche and Fidorun.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57\u201cAran is well-known for issuing borrowed name accounts, whereas Deutsche for money laundering. And Fidorun is infamous for its high-interest rates for their loans, it\u2019s a bank that sucks away the money from the citizens of the empire. It is the most notorious out of the three. If you ever have a need to go to Fidorun bank, no matter what, you must always come and find me before that! Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 .\u201dI guess they are like a private loan company? Aran, Deutsche, and Fidorun. I\u2019ll keep them in mind. As I expected, it was a good idea to come and find my mother about this.\u201cI am not sure why the prince\u2019s mansion is conducting transactions with Aran Bank\u2026 but if you are taking over the management as the lady of the house, I advise you to stop dealing with them.\u201d The countess advised.\u201cAre they that bad that I should cut ties?\u201d\u201cIf it really is purely transactional then it may not be a problem\u2026 but it is a place famous for money laundering and ill-gotten funds. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t happen but I worry just in case word spreads that you are dealing with them. And even us in the Banks Union don\u2019t know who the real owner of Aran Bank is, so it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry since you are the wife of the prince.\u201d\u201cBanks Union?\u201d\u201cYes. Every year all the heads of the banks come together to set the benchmarks for interest rates and never has the owner of Aran Bank shown up.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dBased on the information I have so far, it seems very likely that Dajal\u2019s embezzled money is in Aran Bank. But if they don\u2019t disclose transactions, it means I\u2019ve hit the wall. \u00a0An owner that doesn\u2019t reveal himself\u2026 Dajal can\u2019t be the owner, can he?I wonder why I feel so uncertain\u2026As Amethyst fell deep in thought, clear signs of worry were born on Countess Lohikin\u2019s face. She caught on to the change in expression, she had not intended to cause her mother to worry.Even in the previous world when she had lived with her parents before she had gotten married, the only topic she\u2019d ever discussed with them was about work as she didn\u2019t want them to worry. After she got married she told them even less. Instead of going on and on about her life, she was busy trying to reassure them that she was doing well. Since to them, her living well was something to be proud of.Realising that asking any more would cause her mother to worry, Amethyst decided to change the subject.\u201cHow is Father these days? And what about Merrild and Matin? Where are they? Do they still fight?\u201d\u201cYour father is busy as always, Merrild and Matin should be studying at the academy. Don\u2019t even mention the fighting. But these days Merrild is being patient with Matin.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Is Merrild 17 this year?\u201d\u201cNo silly. She\u2019s 18. Soon she\u2019ll need to have her coming of age party. Maybe that\u2019s why? She\u2019s a lot more collected and well-behaved these days. Oh, and since you are here why don\u2019t you stay the night. It\u2019ll make your father happy.\u201d\u201cAh, no. I need to go back soon,\u201d Amethyst said.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to stay and see your father? He will be very disappointed.\u201d Countess Lohikin urged\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 erm today Alec might come home early\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess I was being insensitive when you guys are newlyweds. These days your father has been coming home rather late. I thought he would be coming home earlier now that he is a vice-minister.\u201d\u201cReally? Do tell him not to overwork himself\u2026 and take care of his health. Next time, I\u2019ll come together with Alec.\u201d\u201cWill you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Amethyst smiled.Now that she thought of it because she had gone to sleep early these days she had barely seen Alexcent. Since she wasn\u2019t tired after a long day of labour and not exhausted as usual she was determined to wait up for him\u2026Since the busy Alec might come home earlier today.\u2929\u201cMadam, His Imperial Highness has arrived.\u201d\u201cReally? He really did come home earlier today.\u201dWhen she heard that Alexcent had returned home early just as she had wished, Amethyst got up from her seat in a hurry to greet him. She was about to eat dinner that was placed on the table in front of her.\u201cOh, you\u2019re not asleep today for a change.\u201dBut even before she could leave the bedroom, Alexcent appeared.He was still dressed in his court robes. He must have heard that she had not gone to bed yet and came straight to the bedroom without changing out of his clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s not time for bed yet.\u201d\u201cAh, you were having your meal. Good, I\u2019ve not eaten so let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go to the dining room\u2026 .\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dAlexcent turned his gaze and gave his orders. \u201cHave it prepared.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lord.\u201dThe maid bowed and exited the bedroom, then immediately as though they had been waiting, Pon and a maid entered with a tray of food.Since it was the butler\u2019s responsibility to prepare the meal of the prince, Pon took the liberty of setting the table even though it was Amethyst\u2019s bedroom. Then he bowed and quickly left.\u201cPlease let me know if you need anything else. Then, enjoy your evening.\u201dThe maids left as well and it was only the two of them in the room.Amethyst was appreciating that face she had long missed. Recently her eyes had been rotting away because she had only been looking at Dajal\u2019s face, so looking at the one before her felt like she was being revived mentally and physically.She had been appreciating his visage when their eyes met, so she quickly opened her mouth to talk.\u201cToday, I went to Lohikin Mansion.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Alexcent had already been briefed by Pon, but answered as though he wasn\u2019t aware.\u201cYes. I went to visit mother.\u201d\u201cYour mother?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58\u201cYes. She seemed to be worried that my father is coming home later than before.\u201dAlexcent must have been reminded of something as he opened his mouth. \u201cAh, Count Lohikin. Unexpectedly, he has an uptight side to him.\u201d\u201cReally? Are things too much for him\u2026 I can\u2019t help but worry if appointing him as the vice-minister was the right choice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that BAD. Being uptight in the financial department is a strength. He\u2019s doing well so you need not worry.\u201d Alexcent quickly added on as she showed signs of worry.\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWas it the only reason you went back to visit your mother?\u201d\u201cMmmm\u2026.\u201dOf course, that was not the only reason. Should I test him a little?Amethyst who had been chewing on a piece of meat swallowed it before she spoke. \u201cActually, I visited her because I was curious about something.\u201d\u201cCurious?\u201d Alexcent quirked his eyebrows.\u201cYes. I went to ask her about Aran Bank.\u201d\u201cAran Bank? What about it?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem taken aback or surprised.If he were guilty then he would have shown some change in expression\u2026 Does he really not have anything to do with it? Or is his expression a facade?Amethyst continued on. \u201cJust that\u2026 I heard of the banks affiliated with the mansion\u2026 and was curious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the banks I am affiliated with don\u2019t involve Aran Bank.\u201d\u201cRight? I must have heard wrongly.\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear it from?\u201d It was a sharp question, she could get busted if she pursued it any further.I don\u2019t have enough evidence to tell him the truth yet. For now, I should change the topic\u2026\u201cI think it was from that very thick stack of documents Pon gave me before. There were quite a many, so I was just flipping through\u2026 Perhaps I mistook it with another similar bank.\u201dAmethyst reinforced the thickness of the document by gesturing with her thumb and index finger.\u201cOh before I forget, Mother told me about the other banks. Alec, do you know which are the three banks you should avoid in the empire?\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cAran, Deutsche and Fidorun. And out of all three, Fidorun is the worst. They are the most blood-thirsty ones.\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026.\u201d Alexcent who had been drinking his wine coughed on it.\u201cHoney are you okay?\u201d Amethyst hurriedly asked.\u201cBlood-thirsty ones, huh?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre they really that\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why such banks with bad reputations exist. The banks that live on the blood, sweat, and tears of the citizens of the empire should disappear.\u201dIt was commonly known how people fell into debt after borrowing. A loan with an interest of 40% of the principal\u2026 It\u2019s in a blink of an eye before the interest adds up to more than the principal amount. It was a system that in the end, required you to sell out everything you have\u2026 Even your body.If Countess Lohikin had warned her to this extent, it must mean the Fidorun was one such.\u201cDon\u2019t you agree, Alec?\u201d\u201cI guess.\u201d\u201cSee, even you share the same thoughts as I. Those kinds of banks are the worst.\u201dAn engrossed Amethyst continued to cut into her steak and rambled on. Alexcent, who was quietly listening, thought to himself as he placed his wine glass back on the table.There\u2019s going to be a need to change the mood.Then, with intent, he looked at his wife longingly and spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t get all excited over other things, get excited only by me.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dHe answered her question with his lips.\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201dThrough joined lips, tongues intertwined. Amethyst could feel her heart pounding from the top of her head to the tip of her toes.Really, his kisses are the best. All the worries about the unsolved problems simply vanish from my mind.The ceaseless kissing rendered Amethyst breathless, she hit his shoulder lightly as an indication.\u201cMmmmmm!\u201dOnly then did he move his lips to her cheek, ear, and shoulder leaving red hickies behind, while Amethyst rubbed her face against his hair and whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re not done eating.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m eating right now.\u201dAs his naughty hands dove beneath her hips, she quickly grabbed them. \u201cNot yet\u2026 we need to clean up, no they will come in to clean this\u2026.\u201dAlexcent lifted his face from between her mounds and brought it up to her forehead. After planting a short kiss, he called out to the maids loudly, who quickly entered the bedroom.\u201cClean this quickly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe maids realised that there was a great emphasis placed in the lord\u2019s order as they caught sight of Amethyst who was standing awkwardly with a flushed face.The dinner was quickly cleared away and the retainers left the bedroom. Alexcent lifted her up and headed towards the bed.He had been holding back his patience for too long and it had reached rock bottom, so he had no intention of undressing her calmly. He simply ripped it off.Bzzzzr!As her skin peeped through the torn clothes, his large hands rubbed and touched her urgently. He was eager to feel her warmth and skin with no space in between them. Spreading his fingers wide, he grabbed her firmly until her skin turned red.Tomorrow she might be bruised but for now, he was desperately in need of her touch.Over and over, the two exchanged frantic kisses, and when they were breathless their lips collapsed on one another as they breathed in each other\u2019s scent\u2026 until the air in the room was steamy and hot.\u2929\u201cCarol.\u201dA voice mixed with warning and disappointment was calling out her name.\u201cYes, Sir Dajal.\u201d\u201cYesterday, did you come by my place when I wasn\u2019t there?\u201dAs usual, Amethyst was in Dajal\u2019s quarters to carry out her daily cleaning duties. But the man seemed unhappy about something and looked at her like a predator eyeing its prey. \u00a0His eyes were trained at her with a piercing gaze as though they were peering inside her in search of the truth.Due to the tension, she felt her stomach in a knot, her gaze was unfocused and heart pounding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59It occurred to Amethyst that if she were to falter in her fib here, it would be her neck on the chopping board. So, she let out one word calmly.\u201cYes.\u201dHow did he know? I didn\u2019t go through his stuff. All I did was look through his files. And I placed them right back on the table\u2026 he must be more sensitive than I thought.\u201cI saw you entered my office.\u201d\u201cYes, to clean up.\u201d\u201cClean.\u201d Dajal\u2019s face turned a shade darker.Have I been caught? How did he know that I had entered his office?\u201cTsk, did you think getting rid of the dust with your rag would do the trick?\u201dWhat is that supposed to mean? I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019ve been caught or not. Is he testing me?\u2026 For now, let\u2019s pretend like I have no idea.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. Yesterday, you weren\u2019t around so I took some shortcuts.\u201d Amethyst spoke in the softest tone she could muster.\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what happens if you don\u2019t do \u00a0your work diligently\u2026.\u201d His hawkish gaze was penetrating right to her bones.\u201cI-I am so sorry. Please forgive me this time. I will never do that again.\u201d\u201cFine. This time I will let you off but there won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dAm I off the hook? That\u2019s a relief! But he seems a lot more sensitive than I thought, so I had better be careful.Amethyst bowed her head and continued wiping the dust with her rag in front of Dajal. The suspicious gaze didn\u2019t disappear and constantly followed her. Then as if reminded of something, his eyes widened and he smirked.\u2929That afternoon, like any other day the maids were gathered at one place. Roman, Amethyst, and the other maids who knew her as Carol were all lined up in an orderly manner.Dajal walked up and down and called out.\u201cJane!\u201dThe maid that was called out stepped forward.\u201cCarin!\u201d\u201cHebe!\u201dAs Dajal swung the short, thin whip in his hand into the air, the leather tassels swung around dizzily. \u00a0The three maids must have known what was about to happen, as they were pale and shaking. The oblivious Amethyst simply stood in line like the rest.\u201cDo you know why you have been called out?\u201d Dajal\u2019s menacing tone rang in the air.\u201cYes.\u201dAs Dajal pointed the whip at the maid named Jane, she sobbed and finally mustered up an answer.\u201cDid you think you can just get away with it after doing such a crappy job cleaning?!\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201d Her sobs deepened.\u201cYes, you should be sorry. Right?\u201d Dajal tapped on Carin\u2019s shoulder and spoke gently.Carin\u2019s face appeared unusually uncomfortable and flushed. Dajal was groping her chest with his arms around her shoulders. From behind it would appear as two people on good terms. \u00a0As he pinched her nipples and harassed her, Carin\u2019s face expressed disgust, fear, and humiliation.\u201cThen what should I do? Hmm? Tell me.\u201d Dajal smoothly withdrew his hand and lifted up her chin.\u201cI deserve\u2026 deserve to be punished.\u201dDajal then moved over to Jane but not before pinching Carin\u2019s bottom.\u201cJane.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Dajal called on her, Jane\u2019s two calmly folded hands started to tremble.\u201cWhich type of punishment is the best fit?\u201d\u201c\u2026..!\u201dJane stood frozen to the spot unable to answer.Dajal lifted the whip and ran it across Jane\u2019s lower abdomen. She then closed her eyes and moved her lips.\u201cAs always\u2026 the punishment bestowed by Sir Dajal.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dWith that, he lifted the whip high up.\u201cI\u2026I am sorry.\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201dWhip! Whip! Whip!Even though there were loud sounds and clothes torn, the maids flinched momentarily before standing straight back up.Amethyst\u2019s eyes widened.I need to stop it. I need to stop it\u2026But her body was frozen and didn\u2019t listen to her. She who was already the recipient of his suspicion would be able to save them for now if she stepped in, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to get rid of him entirely. There was no choice since she had gathered no proof. If Dajal insisted that he was punishing them for doing a poor job cleaning, then there was no other way to argue back.Right now this is probably a warning to me.\u201cSorry? Because of you, do you know how much discomfort you\u2019ve caused to the Lady of the House? Because of you I was reprimanded by her.\u201dWhip!Once again the sound of the whip filled the room.\u201cI\u2026 will make\u2026 sure not to let it happen\u2026 again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a given! But based on what you\u2019ve said you deserve to be punished!\u201d\u201cPlease forgive\u2026 Aghhh!\u201dEven before the maid could beg for forgiveness, Dajal whipped her again.How dare he\u2026 use my name! Amethyst ground her teeth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60As nobody stepped in, Amethyst turned to look at them. As though they were used to the sight, and just waiting for it to quickly end, not one of them displayed any expression on their faces.For how long\u2026 for how long have these things happened repeatedly?Amethyst turned to face the maids being whipped. The maid name Hebe was down on her knees and was begging.\u201cPlease\u2026 I am sorry! Please forgive me!\u201d\u201cBe quiet!\u201d\u201cAghhh!\u201dWhip! Whip!The sound of the whip continued on. Then soon the thin whip started to cut into their flesh. Blood dripped from the tassels on the whip and brought about a grin on Dajal\u2019s face. His opaque pupils were filled with excitement and his lips rose into a sadistic smile.The sight of him made Amethyst shudder. He was going overboard to call this a warning. His act was going past excitement and more towards a frenzy. As she was about to step forward to stop him, a hand ceased her.Amethyst turned to face the owner of the hand.Roman!As their eyes met, Roman shook her head and whispered softly, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cThey are not being reprimanded for doing a poor job.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJane paid less bribes this month as she had to pay for her sister\u2019s wedding, Carin too as her mother is not well. Hebe had to bail out her brother who got himself in trouble.\u201d\u201cThen this means\u2026.!\u201d\u201cYes. This is a form of warning to everyone including you. If you get involved now, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 If we leave them like that then-\u201d Amethyst was flabbergasted at this atrocity.\u201cHe will stop soon. If you really want to reach your objective\u2026 you must hold out for now.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 .\u201dRoman looked desperately at Amethyst. Then they heard a sharp voice.\u201cWho is chit-chatting away! Huh?\u201d Dajal slowly made his way and stood in front of Roman. The leather tassels were now stuck together due to the blood, and with that, he poked at her chest.Romans tried hard to stand still as she was pushed off balance.\u201cHave you still not come to your senses?!\u201d\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d\u201cJust because I\u2019ve been letting you off lately you now think I\u2019m easy?\u201d\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d\u201cYa right. You always pretend to be upright but in truth, I know you\u2019re busy spreading your legs for those knights.\u201d\u201cI have never done such a thing.\u201d\u201cHa, everyone knows you are a prostitute so who will believe you!\u201dAs Roman glared at him like she could kill him, Dajal flinched. Then surprised at his own reaction he raised his hand.\u201cThis little wrench!\u201d\u201cSir Dajal! I am sorry!\u201dAt Amethyst\u2019s cries, Dajal stopped his hand that was inches away from Roman\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2026 was new and unsure, so I was asking Roman for help.\u201d\u201cYou should choose a better person to ask.\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dFor some reason, Dajal backed off. Then he spat on the floor and barked, \u201cI\u2019ll end it here for today. Everyone back to your stations!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDajal disappeared and the maids left the scene. Some maids supported Hebe, Jane, and Carin and returned with them.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Amethyst asked Roman.\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI wonder why he backed off. I thought I was going to get hit\u2026.\u201d It was bizarre how Dajal spared her.\u201cCarol\u2026 I think you should be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI think he has targeted\u2026 Carol as the next one.\u201d Roman blurted out.\u201cWhat do you\u2026 oh my?!\u201dSo just now that meant I was marked out.\u201cAs much as possible try not to be alone with him.\u201d She cautioned her mistress\u201cBut I have to clean Dajal\u2019s quarters.\u201d\u201cPrecisely\u2026 that\u2019s why I worry. Always be on your guard. And if anything happens\u2026 run immediately.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I will be careful. By the way, I have always been curious. Why doesn\u2019t Dajal fire you instead of harassing you so much? If I were him, I would fire those that opposed me. How do you get past it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.To them, I\u2019m the best example. To show what happens if you go against him. So he won\u2019t fire me. And I know that other places are not much different. And nowhere pays as high as the prince\u2019s mansion.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dOther noble households are not much different?I wonder why the unfairness of the world is the same wherever you go. I wonder if this is the unspoken rule of life.Similar patterns in societies, the unchanging history made Amethyst sick.\u201cI think it\u2019s best if you go back and rest for today. You don\u2019t look too well.\u201d Roman suggested.\u201cI\u2019m sure Dajal will look for me\u2026\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t look for you today. After causing a scene like this he will quieten down for some time.\u201d She reassured.\u201cReally?\u201d Amethyst was a tad unsure.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I will go back for today.\u201dOnly after returning to her bedroom, did Amethyst feel the tension loosen away. Then, she felt herself gag. The screaming of the maids rang in her ear. The sight of them being whipped was a traumatic experience in itself.For how long had these things happened and remained unsaid\u2026 For how long?She was overcome by shock and fear. She curled up under the sheets.Today, she didn\u2019t feel like running into Alexcent. She hated him for not knowing anything, not caring, and not doing anything. She hated him for even keeping Dajal by his side.Quickly, as quickly as possible I need to find the proof. Then I need to chase him out of this place.But what if\u2026 Alec doesn\u2019t take my side because I\u2019m only temporarily the Lady of the House? What if he corners me and tells me to know my place\u2026At the thought of such a possibility, the thought of his face pissed her off. She closed her eyes to fall asleep quickly before the man got back to the mansion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61\u201cBring this to the butler and get his signature.\u201d Dajal ordered dismissively.\u201cMay I know what I need his signature for?\u201d Amethyst asked upon receiving Dajal\u2019s ledgers.\u201cIt\u2019s this month\u2019s ledger.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dAh, I hoped it would be something I can use as evidence, but it\u2019s only the ledger. Since it needs to be approved by Pon I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a fake ledger.But if I run into Pon in this state then my secret undercover will be blown away.\u201cMay I ask why we need to show this to the butler? Shouldn\u2019t this be shown to the lady of the house\u2026\u201d\u201cHa, you sure have a lot of questions.\u201d\u201cI am sorry. It\u2019s just my first time working in such a big mansion so I\u2019m not familiar with things\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat would a daughter of a well-known noble know about running a mansion? I\u2019m sure all she knows is to sip tea all day or play dress up.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 that so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This must be why she left even the running of the main estate to the butler in charge and spends her time shopping. Well, that makes things easier for me.\u201dAt Dajal\u2019s words, Amethyst clenched her fist. If she hadn\u2019t tasked Pon to run everything then things might have been different. It felt like all of this was her fault.Just as her mind came to such a thought, Dajal shouted.\u201cWhat are you standing there for, go!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOnce Amethyst reached the main estate, she looked for Lunia instead of Pon.\u201cMadam?\u201d\u201cLunia, I need your help!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 I was wondering where you were these days. Was this what you were up to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. So please pretend you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be overlooked as long as I pretend not to know! The moment His Highness finds out, my head will no longer be attached to my neck!\u201d Lunia said in fluster.\u201cI will make sure no harm goes your way.\u201d\u201cYou are already causing me plenty.\u201d\u201cLunia\u2026\u201d Lunia took a step back as Amethyst looked at her with puppy dog eyes.\u201cFine. How can I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here on an errand. This is the ledger from Dajal that needs to be approved by Pon. It needs his signature but as you can see I am in no position to get it myself.\u201d\u201cThat is true\u2026 Since Sir Pon has an eye for detail you just need me to get it signed on your behalf?\u201d\u201cYes. I will be grateful if you will.\u201dLunia accepted the ledger and flipped through. \u201cDid you investigate it?\u201d\u201cYes. But I\u2019ve not made much progress. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019s nothing special on the ledger. Nothing seems illegitimate.\u201d\u201cPrecisely. Everything is too perfect.\u201d\u201cYes. I also think the real ledger must be elsewhere\u2026 which is what I need to find.\u201d\u201cIs that why you are going around in a maid\u2019s uniform?\u201dAmethyst shrugged in reply.\u201cI will investigate on my own as well.\u201d Lunia offered.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAnd also\u2026 Madam, since you asked me to pretend not to know, should you ever encounter a dangerous situation, just shout and ask someone to save you as loudly as you can. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cShout?\u201d Amethyst quirked an eyebrow.\u201cYes, shout asking for someone to save you.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dActually, Amethyst didn\u2019t quite understand what Lunia meant but promised that she would nonetheless.\u201cYou should rest for the day,\u201d Lunia said.\u201cBut I need to bring the ledger back to Dajal. If I don\u2019t he will get suspicious\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeave that to me. I will tell Sir Pon that I received it from a maid from the side estate, and that I asked that maid to run my errand so have another maid pass it back to Dajal.\u201d\u201cCarol.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d Lunia was taken aback.\u201cMy name. It\u2019s Carol. That is\u2026 among the employees I told them to call me Carol.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dLunia placed her hand on her forehead and let out a loud sigh.\u201cJust\u2026 how long have you been going around like that?\u201d\u201cFor some time.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 I\u2019m more surprised that no one found out.\u201dAmethyst let out a forced laugh, and just as Lunia advised retired to her bedroom. She quickly changed into a dress before the maids could see and sat down on the sofa.Phew! \u2026 For some reason, she couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud sigh.From the window she heard the sound of horse hooves and a carriage, so she leaned against the window and looked down.Alec?He\u2019s back earlier than I thought!I\u2019m glad I followed Lunia\u2019s advice and returned earlier. If not there might have been a big ruckus saying the prince\u2019s wife is missing. Or I would have been caught in my maid uniform.If her undercover mission was busted before she could find the evidence, then the already suspicious and extremely careful Dajal would raise up his barriers.She saw the figure that normally returned after dusk descend the carriage. Amethyst left her bedroom and made her way towards the entrance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Perhaps it was because she felt bad that she didn\u2019t manage to catch him yesterday as she was angry at him. For some reason, unlike most days, she wanted to greet him at the entrance.I guess surprising him like this from time to time is not too bad.\u201cAlec, how are you back so early today?\u201dAmethyst who was rushing towards Alexcent came to a stop as she spotted someone next to him.It was Dajal, greeting her with his head bowed.\u201cAh, Ash. I ended my tasks early today.\u201dAmethyst swallowed dryly and carefully approached Alexcent, when Dajal opened his mouth.\u201cI greet you for the first time Madam. I am Dajal in charge of the side estate.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn case she got caught, she kept her answers as short as possible.Damn, what is Dajal doing here?Her entire head was a blank sheet.\u201cWow, just like I\u2019ve heard you are beautiful, Madam.\u201d He continued to bow and kept at his insincere praises.Does he not recognise me? Or is he pretending not to know?Amethyst tried hard to read his thoughts.\u201cSo, the maintenance fee for the estate is not enough?\u201d Alexcent seemed unhappy with Dajal praising Amethyst as he stepped in before she could reply.\u201cYes, Sir. There was a heavy downpour recently and the ground collapse,\u201d He solemnly replied.\u201cThe rain was not to such extent.\u201d\u201cIt was a place with a weak foundation\u2026 so it has always been a weak spot.\u201d\u201cAll right, fine! Pon!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Pon said, \u201cI will have it put in the budget.\u201d\u201cThis time fix it properly,\u201d Alexcent said sharply.\u201cNot to worry, Sir.\u201dCollapse? In the side estate? Was there such a place? As she was deep in thought, she saw Lunia coming her way. Damn, why is Lunia here as well?Lunia must have had the same thoughts as her expression crumbled momentarily before becoming composed behind a poker face.Coincidentally Alexcent, Amethyst, Lunia, Pon, and Dajal were all gathered in one place at the entrance of the main mansion.Lunia quickly greeted Alec. \u201cSir, Madam. I didn\u2019t know you were both here.\u201d\u201cWhat brings you here\u201d\u201cI\u2026 was on my way to the side estate.\u201dLunia glanced at Amethyst at Alexcen\u2019t question.\u201cThe side estate? You? What for?\u201d\u201cI coincidentally ran into a maid from there and sent her on an errand\u2026 so on her behalf I was going to pass this to Sir Dajal.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Dajal asked incredulously.\u201cYes. I had to send her on an urgent errand. She asked me to pass this to you.\u201dLunia handed the ledger to Dajal.Dajal accepted it and asked, \u201cWhat was the name of the maid?\u201d\u201cCarol\u2026 I think she said her name was Carol.\u201dAmethyst felt her neck stiffen.\u201cCarol?\u201d Alexcent asked.Dajal, Lunia, Amethyst all instantly looked towards Alexcent. There was tension in the air and no one dared to breathe.\u201cYes\u2026 I think it was Carol.\u201d\u201cDo you know this child?\u201d The one to ask him that question was Dajal, but for some reason, Alexcent answered while looking at Amethyst.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cShe is new but unfamiliar with things\u2026 so I am teaching her everything one by one.\u201d\u201cUnfamiliar?\u201d Alexcent mused.\u201cYes. I heard she came from the countryside, so she is still too green and it takes time to teach her.\u201d Dajal explained.\u201cSo you are teaching her yourself?\u201d Alexcent\u2019s eyebrows quirked.\u201cYes. Since everyone in the estate is busy\u2026 I should, of course, teach her. It\u2019s nice and nostalgic, reminding me of the good old days. Hahaha.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dJust because of one word that Alexcent said, Dajal rambled on.Looking at how he was senselessly rambling on and on in front of Alexcent, he didn\u2019t seem to have found out that the maid Carol was in fact the Lady of the House. Since she wasn\u2019t one to catch people\u2019s eyes, he didn\u2019t seem to have made the connection that the woman next to Alexcent and the girl Carol were the one and the same. He was the shallow kind that judged people by their outward appearances.Should I be relieved or offended? Amethyst raged inwardly.Wait a minute! If he doesn\u2019t recognise me should I take things up a notch?\u201cCan I take a look at that ledger?\u201dLunia squinted at Amethyst\u2019s words. As if to ask secretly what she was up to. Amethyst tried her best to ignore Lunia and directed her gaze to Dajal.\u201cMy Lady?\u201d Dajal asked in surprise.\u201cYes. It\u2019s originally my task but I feel bad that I\u2019ve asked you to do it.\u201d\u201cOh, please don\u2019t say such things. I\u2019m sure you have so many things to do so how could you possibly pay attention to things like this?\u201d he hurriedly said.\u201cI don\u2019t have that many tasks. It\u2019s mainly shopping,\u201d Amethyst nonchalantly replied.\u201cHaha, But\u2026 .\u201dDajal must have been uncomfortable in front of the prince, as he seemed reluctant to share the ledger. Not only was he not using the affiliated banks of the prince but he also didn\u2019t seem to want to be caught choosing and trading with Aran Bank which had a bad reputation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63There\u2019s no way that Alexcent, who owned several banks, wouldn\u2019t notice it. This made it clear that there was something going on in Aran Bank.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing that I know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to have to see~\u201dShe snatched away the ledger that Dajal held in his hand.Flap, flap!She flipped through the pages one at a time.\u201cHmmm\u2026 I see\u2026 This is it.\u201d Amethyst muttered with an intentional strange nuance, she didn\u2019t miss the sweat pouring down Dajal\u2019s forehead.If she were to tell Alec to look at this, how would he react? Looking at the restless and sulking Dajal, she had an impulsive urge but in the end, held it in.\u201cLooks good. You\u2019ve done a perfect job at managing.\u201d\u201cTha-tha-thank you.\u201d\u201cFor what? I ought to thank you for doing such a thorough job.\u201d\u201cNo, not at all! That\u2019s too much.\u201dHe was a dimwit embezzling money. Amethyst couldn\u2019t tell if he was complimenting her or cursing. The shame of distinguishing a person only by appearance; she couldn\u2019t stand that cowering fool.\u201cIf you\u2019re finished, let\u2019s go,\u201d Alexcent said, turning to look at Lunia.The gaze was so sharp that it made Lunia hold her breath. The prince\u2019s eyes seemed to give off a warning of some sort. With his eyes still on the chamber-maid, he slid his hand around Amethyst\u2019s waist and pulled her in.When they stepped off into the hallway towards the bedroom, Amethyst insinuated\u2026\u201cIs the ground in this wing really weak?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the fact that the ground is weak?\u201d she queried.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNothing, just asking\u2026 I heard it\u2019s dangerous.\u201dWhat did he mean by \u2018why\u2019? Because he had never seen a building collapse before?But if the torn-down place that Dajal mention didn\u2019t exist\u2026 Then was this place a rip-off? Was he like this every time?If so, Alexcent had trust in him!\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about a thing. Even though you look at him like that, he\u2019s a useful guy.\u201d Alec broke her train of thought.\u201cIs that so? If you say so, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d Amethyst just smiled mournfully at him who had said Dajal was useful.It was clear that he really trusted him. She wondered if he were smiling inside.Alexcent kissed her temple and said, \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s an honor. You coming out to meet me at the door.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 only for today!\u201d\u2929Amethyst was in the middle of cleaning Dajal\u2019s residence today, too. Perhaps Lunia\u2019s lie had slipped through the cracks because the man didn\u2019t ask about yesterday. However, his persistent glare that seemed like he had a goal was unavoidable.Dajal still sat on the sofa wearing only a gown, looking at Amethyst with a subtle look of desire.Oh\u2026 my arm hurts, she thought. The place is clean, so why does he keep telling me to wipe what I\u2019ve already wiped down?Amethyst was constantly moving in Dajal\u2019s dirty, sludgy eyes. He had been continuously watching her, almost surveilling, from when she entered the house. The windows were still firmly shut, and she was sweating from mopping so much; her breathing was getting rougher and arms sorer.When the uncomfortable sweating and dirty air really pissed her off, she unknowingly let out a groan,\u201cUggghhhhh\u2026!\u201dDammit! I need to be more careful. He might hear me.While mopping, she carefully went in Dajal\u2019s direction, but when she turned slightly to look, he was gone.Where did he go?!!At that moment, a dark shadow appeared in front of her.Shit! How did that happen?\u201cOh, it must be pretty hot. Your face is flushed like you\u2019ve worked yourself up.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cYour clothes are looking a little soggy right now~\u201dWhen Dajal\u2019s hand reached the ribbon collar wrapped around her neck, goosebumps spread all over her body.\u201cIt\u2019s al\u2026 right.\u201d\u201cHow can you be all right when your face is burning from breathing in this hot air?\u201dHis hand then came above the ribbon and grazed Amethyst\u2019s red cheek.She lifted her arm to try to pull her arm back, but the shaky arm wouldn\u2019t move.\u2018\u2026!\u2019Dammit, that\u2019s it! My arm won\u2019t move. Is this what the bastard has been after this whole time?! Swoop in on me after rendering my arm useless. What now? It\u2019s clear that if I stay here any longer it could get dangerous. Should I run away\u2026?But Dajal\u2019s hand was already heading to her chest.Don\u2019t do that!\u201cThis\u2026 Please don\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cHaha, haha, haha! How can all of you say the same thing over and over again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dDajal gripped Amethyst\u2019s chin in his rough hand.\u201cAaarrgghh!\u201d\u201cListen up. What\u2019s gonna happen if you disobey me? You saw it, too!! Also, this place is kind of secluded, so no matter how much you scream no one\u2019s gonna hear you.\u201dHe pulled Amethyst\u2019s face closer as he puckered his lips. With all her might, she wrested herself, barely managing to break away from his grip. Then, she ran as fast as she could to the entrance, grabbed the door handle, and shook it frantically. But the door wouldn\u2019t budge\u2026 somehow it was locked tightly and wouldn\u2019t open.Dajal just stood there staring, amused.\u201cHee-hee, that\u2019s useless. Well, hello there! You\u2019re cute when you\u2019re all up in a fuss.\u201d\u201c~ You\u2019re crazy!\u201d\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s quite a foul mouth you got there. That turns me on even more. But there\u2019s no next time.\u201d He sniggered.Amethyst hurriedly scurried toward the window. She was about to open it and scream out loudly\u2026 but when she grabbed it, all it did was wiggle and rattle; just like the door, it was somehow locked. And when she went to check the window sill, she was shocked to find nail after nail after nail hammered in.I was too complacent.Now she had no choice but to wait for someone to come here to find her, the duchess.But who the hell would come all the way here looking for her? A duchess who enjoyed just being alone\u2026But still, she had to buy herself some time\u2026 At least until Alec returned to the mansion.\u201cHahaha! Isn\u2019t it time for you to give up now? You\u2019re running my patience.\u201d\u201cFuck off! See what happens when you lay a hand on me again.\u201d\u201cI said I liked you; that doesn\u2019t give you the right to talk to me so recklessly. I said I\u2019d let it slide only once. Now you\u2019re pissing me off.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Amethyst was raging mad at the man in front of her and, more importantly, at herself. She tried her best but didn\u2019t have the strength to handle Dajal\u2019s strong, healthy body in her debilitating condition. She now realized how weak she really was\u2026 And how dangerous a situation she had fallen into.No one was around. No one could save her.She was only able to guess what other nauseating things he\u2019d do to her in the future, and that stimulated the fear within even more. What she had seen on the news was happening to her right this moment. Her fingertips were shaking, and she could barely breathe. Tears welled up in her eyes.Dajal, who was staring at the woman frozen with fear in front of him, was approaching closely with a licentious, sinister smile. Stuck in a corner, Amethyst was a sitting duck with nowhere to go. She got goosebumps looking at his face drawing closer and closer.Scary man!!!At the sight of an Amethyst trapped without an escape route and helpless, Dajal stuck out his tongue, looking like a snake that just found its prey.Slither, slither\u2026She felt disgusted. She turned her head to avoid his eyes, but the man grabbed her jaw again and uttered, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to get a taste of you. I have to punish you for making me move around so much like this. What\u2019ll be good, eh? What do you like?\u201dFor a moment, things that would happen next unfolded in her head: Blue and yellow bruises on her shoulders, wrists, forearms, and abdomen; deep, red flesh seen under her torn collar that dyed the maid\u2019s black robe a thick red.Dammit!She nearly came close to fainting.No, get your head together!\u201cI\u2019m begging you\u2026 Someone, please help me! Argghh!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad being stuck in a body that\u2019s as limp as a corpse.\u201dDuring Amethyst\u2019s last-ditch effort, Dajal put more strength in his grip and slid his tongue up her cheek. As her breathing tightened, pale veins popped out and her face turned bright yellow.At this rate, she\u2019d lose consciousness soon. No\u2026!Scream! Scream out- save me!\u201cSa-sa\u2026 save me!!\u201dAfter the scream, her hand which had been scratching at Dajal\u2019s hand gripping her chin fell. The frustration of being unable to breathe and the fear of what was to come distracted her. Her red eyes with the small veins soon hid behind her eyelids.Oh, Alec!Will his face cross my mind\u2026Bang!Suddenly, \u00a0the door broke open with a roaring sound. Two armed men dressed in all-gray burst through in an instant; one of them pointed a knife tip at Dajal\u2019s neck.A red blood drop formed at the blade tip resting on the creep\u2019s neck.\u201cTake your hands off the lady!\u201d\u201cWh-what?!! What does that\u2026 Ugh!\u201d Dajal tried to speak.The knife was pressed harder on his neck, blood flowed down to the handle. He slowly took his hands off of the girl, raising them both in the air.Amethyst then fell to the ground gasping for air. When her strangled voice finally cleared up, she gasped and took a deep breath.The other armed man helped her up and asked, \u201cAre you all right, Madam?\u201d\u201cHa! Do I look like I\u2019m all right right now?\u201d\u201cN-n-no, Madam. We apologize for the delay.\u201dDajal had no idea what was going on right now.How could she, who was nothing but a maid\u2026 be a duchess?? Even worse, a duchess pretending to be a maid???F*ck! I\u2019m f*cked now! Rotten b*tch! How could that sneaky b*tch do this!?\u2019 Dajal frantically searched around for a way to escape.Amethyst, rubbing her stinging throat, took a deep breath and asked, \u201cI\u2019m all right now. But the important thing is\u2026 who are you two?\u201d\u201cWe are the bodyguards here to protect you, Madam.\u201d\u201cProtect me?!\u201d Amethyst was taken aback.\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cSince when?\u201d\u201cSince the moment you first arrived at the duke\u2019s mansion, Madam.\u201dDamn\u2026 She didn\u2019t even know that. How could knights be protecting her without her knowing? Without having to think twice over it, she already knew who had taken such measures. Alec! I thank you for saving me\u2026 Thanks to you, I can breathe again!However, she frowned when his face momentarily flashed in her mind.Not long after, another knight stepped over the pile of wood left by the broken door and said, \u201cI\u2019ve found Your Highness.\u201dBoth Amethyst and Dajal stiffened up at the knight\u2019s words. Today, one of them was going to be living corpse. No\u2026 Well, she hadn\u2019t died at least but wasn\u2019t relieved nonetheless.Not yet.She hadn\u2019t found any concrete evidence yet, but she\u2019d try to expose the misdeeds as much as she could. She managed to pull herself together. She was quivering with fear that Dajal still hadn\u2019t left. Even so, this wasn\u2019t the time when she could sit down and cry.She slowly flattened out the wrinkles on her dress, gathering her strength, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, to where His Highness is.\u201dShe put the incident from just now behind her and took a step towards the unknown. She didn\u2019t know what she was thinking when she decided to go to his office. However, when she came to her senses in the end, she was already there.Alexcent was leaning against a thick mahogany desk in front of her. \u00a0He seemed to be emanating a murderous warning to all those in the room. That cold gaze that was threatening to slice down at any moment, made it clear that even a single speck of dust was unacceptable.Amethyst finally lost it. At this moment, her thoughts were inexplicably away from normal. How could that seething rage, overflowing through every pore of his body, seem so sexy? How the heck can I find this image beautiful\u2026?The man was staring intently at her as if he were going to kill her.Amethyst, whose hair stood on end as she looked at the man that couldn\u2019t even be approached easily, \u00a0fell in love with him without even realizing it. However, she buried that thought the moment she glanced over to the side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65In front of Alexcent to the left stood Amethyst and to the right were Dajal, Pon, and Gen. Judging from their expression, it was evident that this wasn\u2019t going to go down well.\u201cSo, do you want to explain why you were dressed up as a maid at Dajal\u2019s residence?\u201d The low-pitched, cold voice froze Amethyst. Alexcent\u2019s voice was so sinister that it made the hairs on her hands stand up. She was scared. She could feel the tremors in her fingertips. She had to say something, anything. But the panic made her blank and tongue-tied. She could feel the dread ringing in her ears.A dull, slurred voice spoke. \u201cMy Honorable Master. I\u2019ve committed a heinous crime,\u201d said Dajal, on his knees as though pleading for his life.\u201cHeinous crime?\u201d said Alexcent dangerously.\u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d said Dajal in desperation. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was the Duchess! I just assumed she was a maid, trying to seduce me. Forgive me, Lord! My life is at your feet, you can put an end to it as a punishment for me not being able to overcome my temptation.\u201dAmethyst directed a glare at Dajal. What the hell is he even talking about? When did I ever seduce him? Dajal, however, was impervious to her glare. Neither did he care. He just said what he said to escape Alexcent\u2019s wrath.\u201cYour Excellency,\u201d pleaded Dajal, \u201cThat\u2019s the whole truth. I do not know why the respected lady came into my house. I can\u2019t understand why. How was I to know that the maid who was trying to seduce me was the Duchess in disguise? Please believe me!\u201d\u201cNo!,\u201d said Amethyst, exasperated, \u201cThat never happened. You filthy, vile cockroach. What are you even saying? Nobody here is going to believe your outrageous lies.\u201d She stared fiercely at Alexcent as she said this, searching his face.\u201cThen tell me why you were there, dressed as a maid?\u201d said Alexcent icily. She felt his frosty tone unnerve her. There was anger beneath it.Why does he not believe me? Amethyst gathered what was left of her courage and spoke, \u201cI\u2026 I was working undercover.\u201d\u201cUndercover?\u201d he asked, eyebrows raised.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, undaunted, \u201cI had heard about Dajal and his assaults on the maids. I had also heard about the embezzled maintenance fees that were supposed to be paid to them. I did what I had to do in order to gather evidence. Because nobody anywhere seems to care about the maids and their plight. I\u2014\u201d\u201cYou Excellency!,\u201d shouted Dajal, interrupting her. \u201cThat is not true! Duchess Amethyst is lying. I am innocent.\u201dAmethyst was appalled by his audacity. \u201cInnocent? You villainous, dirty liar!\u201d she shot back. \u201cI have seen with my own eyes the state in which the maids live. The living condition, their house, their clothes aren\u2019t fit for any human. I have all the evidence I need to convince me of your misconduct, you slimy roach!\u201d\u201cYour Excellency!\u201d begged Dajal, still on his knees, \u201cI never did anything wrong. She is lying. I have always been loyal and devoted to the Duke of Skad. I am sure you remember that there was a time when the maids were caught stealing the maintenance fees. They tried to frame me! The precious, well-respected Duke stood by my side and proved my innocence. History repeats itself, My Lord. The same injustice is being done to me now. Please do not doubt my loyalty, Your Excellency! This is greatly unfair.\u201dAmethyst took a deep breath. She calmed herself. Losing her head with this scum would not help anything. \u201cI have seen it for myself,\u201d she said, levelly, \u201cHe has been assaulting his employees. I have seen the condition they live in.\u201d\u201cThat is just corporal punishment!\u201d cried Dajal, justifying himself, \u201cWhen managing a huge group of people\u2026 one has to take matters into their own hands sometimes. It was inevitable. I used the cane on them because they broke the discipline of my mansion that I uphold with pride. Sometimes, a man needs to use force to keep his people in line. It was just a simple punishment meted out to the ones at fault.\u201d\u201cYou call splattering blood and ripping flesh a \u2018simple punishment\u2019?\u201d said Amethyst, incredulously.\u201cI admit I went a tad bit too far,\u201d said Dajal, \u201cBut it was only to prevent any such kind of reoccurrence. It had to be done.\u201d\u201cSo you do admit that trying to keep me locked up was \u2018going a tad bit too far\u2019?\u201d she snapped.\u201cThat!\u201d said Dajal, \u201cHow could I have known you were the Duchess? Why did you dress up as a maid and try to seduce me?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d she thundered, \u201cYou piece of shit! Every word out of your filthy mouth is about seduction. Stop lying or I will cut out your tongue!\u201dPon and Gen were taken aback by Amethyst\u2019s anger. They had never seen her cursing and had never expected her to do so. Dajal, on the other hand, used it to his advantage.\u201cYour Excellency!\u201d he cried, \u201cYou see this? It is very natural for the Duchess to utter such inappropriate words. The way she dresses is also a testament to it. Rumor has it, she is always trying to attract men! A behavior never to be expected from a respected lady. A few days ago, she let a driver touch her behind, I saw it!\u201d\u201cYou daft clodpole!\u201d said Amethyst, as she lunged at him. \u201cYour lies are getting outrageous by the second. I would never do such a\u2014\u201dPon had rushed over to hold her back from Dajal, who was just rising from where he knelt on the floor. \u201cMa\u2019am, calm down,\u201d said Pon.\u201cCalm down?\u201d she yelled with anger in her eyes, \u201cHow the hell do you supposed I can calm down while this man runs his mouth slandering me with his lies?\u201d\u201cYou are the one who is trying to frame me with false charges!\u201d said Dajal.\u201cI am going to end you,\u201d she glowered, \u201cYou sick fuck!\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d said Alexcent sharply. Everyone froze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66He looked at her with such anger in his eyes that she felt despondent. Dajal, with his flowery speech, fooled everyone. That was what he was good at doing. Getting under people\u2019s skin and ruining them and always getting away with it. Amethyst\u2019s righteous anger amounted to nothing. She was so angry and helpless that she felt like she would lose her mind.She had made mistakes in life and regretted them. But this wasn\u2019t a mistake. Helping those poor maids was her choice. She felt like she blew it again. Now everyone here seemed to think she was crazy and hysterical, completely losing the point she was trying to make, the truth she had tried to reveal. While Dajal stood there smugly, using his eloquent speech to fool people. It was all so unfair!Amethyst took one look into Alexcent\u2019s eyes and knew that he believed Dajal. Typical men, she scoffed internally. There was no choice, no opening where she could even try to make him understand how wrong Dajal was, how wrong this all was.She would not appear weak and whine. But what other choice did she have? She had to try everything she could, if not for herself, then for the sake of those poor maids. \u201cAlex\u2026 You seriously believe that bastard?\u201d she asked in a pitying voice, \u201cDo you think I would leave someone like you and seduce that cockroach? Really?\u201d\u201cEven if, say,\u201d began Dajal, \u201cthe Duchess\u2019 words are true. Let\u2019s just say for argument\u2019s sake that what she speaks is the truth. Where is the evidence of me trying to sexually assault you, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201cThere are evidences,\u201d she said, \u201cBecause this isn\u2019t the first time you have done something vile like this. The victims\u2019 statements can prove\u2014\u201d\u201cPray tell me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Dajal, \u201cWhere are these \u2018victims\u2019? Perhaps you could call them to testify. That way, you would prove yourself and I would have no way to accuse you of framing me for false charges.\u201dDajal stood there, arrogantly looking at her. She couldn\u2019t believe he had the audacity and things were on his side, despite being a monstrous pile of shit. He smirked. None of these tramps will testify, he thought. And it was true. Amethyst thought about the years of abused that they might have suffered at his hands. The fear that they lived with. She couldn\u2019t make them go through with this. It was not her story to tell.The same thing had happened ten years ago. Dajal had been accused of crimes like these, and none of the maids had testified because of the fear for their lives. Amethyst thought about them. These suffering women who had no choice but to swallow their sorrow and go on with their lives. She would not let them suffer the humiliation.\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d said Amethyst, dejectedly, \u201cThey have suffered enough at your hands. How much more trauma are you going to cause them? I won\u2019t add to their humiliation.\u201d\u201cBut ma\u2019am,\u201d said Dajal, with even more arrogance, \u201cYou have treated me like a criminal, a monster, with no proof, no testimony, no witness. This is surely an injustice.\u201d\u201cThe evidence is at Aran Bank,\u201d she said, playing her last card. She was certain that Dajal\u2019s secret fund was at Aran Bank, the money he had embezzled. \u201cIf it is investigated, all the money you stole will be there. It will be evidence enough.\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d said Dajal, shaking his head, \u201cIf you can bring me the evidence, I will oblige. I have nothing to hide.\u201dShit, Amethyst cursed. She had meant to catch him astonished or stunned. Aran Bank, under the Special Act, would never reveal their customer\u2019s data. They held their principle of confidentiality in a strict view. Even if Aran Bank did agree to provide the data, Dajal wasn\u2019t stupid enough to open a secret bank account in his own name.Her last hope was Alexcent. Alex, please\u2026 she pleaded with her eyes.His red eyes that looked back were stony, devoid of any emotion. While Dajal\u2019s eyes seemed to be mocking her, challenging her. He knew he had won this.Amethyst couldn\u2019t fight alone. She was pretty sure that the stolen funds were in the bank, but no matter however powerful a duchess she was, she couldn\u2019t force them to give her his data. Aran Bank would never agree. It was out of the question. Even if Dajal got fired, it didn\u2019t matter to him. He had enough money, that he had stolen for many years, to live a life of comfort.\u201cIt is embarrassing to hear any more of this,\u201d said a cold voice, which was like an ice pick stabbing at Amethyst\u2019s heart. She lowered her head, defeated and ashamed. She had made a promise to those poor women, and she had failed. How could she face them again? Among these men, who didn\u2019t understand a thing and used women as they pleased, even if she had been calm and rational and approached it differently, she doubted the results would have changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Amethyst\u2019s realizing that nothing would change, bowed her head despondently at Alexcent\u2019s words. While Dajal stood their smug knowing, he had won.\u201cGen,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cYes, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cTake care of it,\u201d he said in a low, deep voice.\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d said Gen and bowed.Gen made his way to the office door. He indicated for someone to come inside. They were the knights who had been standing outside, waiting for their master\u2019s orders. They entered the office and bowed respectfully.Amethyst looked at the knights nervously. What is Alexcent thinking? Is he going to arrest me? She looked at their faces and recognition dawned on her. It was Buerre and Riereia; she knew them! Alexcent nodded at them. A short, curt nod. Riereia from second division made his way towards Dajal and stood before him.\u201cDajal Dusty,\u201d he said, unsheathing his sword, \u201cAny last words?\u201d The metallic clink of the sword as it was pulled out of its scabbard made Amethyst apprehensive.\u201cWhat?!\u201d said Dajal, shocked. His smirk disappeared from his face. He had thought victory was his. He looked at Prince Skad in surprise. \u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cWhy are you so surprised, Dajal?\u201d asked Alexcent.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d said Dajal frantically, \u201cIt has already been established that this is false accusation!\u201d\u201cThis is truly disappointing,\u201d said Alexcent, solemnly, \u201cYou think me a fool, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201d said Dajal, \u201cI would never\u2026.\u201d\u201cI do not like repeating myself,\u201d said Alexcent stonily, \u201cSo listen closely. First, all affairs related to the mansion falls under the authority of the lady of the house. So, if she wants to fire you, you will be fired. She has the authority and nobody, not even me, can disobey her.\u201dDajal looked at him, stunned. Amethyst shared the same reaction. It was that easy? I could have ordered him gone, and it would have been done? She was lightheaded. She didn\u2019t have to disguise herself to gather evidence. She realized that she had trusted no one. She had assumed that nobody would believe her unless she had enough evidence of his wrongdoings. And she obviously hadn\u2019t trusted Alexcent enough to tell him. She sighed inwardly.\u201cIf you think I have been unaware of your stealth, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Alexcent continued, \u201cI kept quiet to see how far you would go, that was the only mistake on my part. I let you be because you weren\u2019t causing direct harm to me. But you have been found out, and I can no longer let this slide.\u201d\u201cBut I have served the Skad family for so long, I\u2014,\u201d trailed off Dajal, wilting under Alexcent\u2019s piercing gaze.\u201cIf you dare to interrupt me one more,\u201d said Alexcent dangerously, \u201cYou will lose your tongue. Do not test my patience.\u201d Dajal lowered his head and kept quiet.\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d said Alexcent. \u201cNow, even if Amethyst was dressed as a maid, it does not give you a right to touch her inappropriately. You have no right to treat a maid in such a manner. Besides, Amethyst might be dressed in rags for all she wanted. That would not change the fact that she is my wife. You offended her, looked down on her, lusted after her and laid your filthy hands on her. The punishment for that will be death.\u201d\u201cYour Highness,\u201d protested Dajal, and remembered Alexcent\u2019s threat.\u201cIn consideration of your generations\u2019 long service to the Skad family, I will grant you a painless death,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201cThat is the only extent of mercy I can show you.\u201d\u201cYou cannot do this without evidence!\u201d cried Dajal.\u201cAhhh,\u201d Alexcent said, smiling coldly, \u201cEvidence, you say.\u201d He turned around and picked a document from a pile on his desk. \u201cYou were so diligent, so shrewd in hiding your tracks, weren\u2019t you? So very smart on invoicing the estate. I am sure it is not a coincidence that the slush funds and leaking internal operating costs match the amount on your account. You fool. Did you know I own the Aran Bank?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be\u2026,\u201d stammered Dajal, stunned. He despaired at seeing no escape and begged. \u201cPlease, Your Highness, spare my life.\u201d\u201cYou told me you had committed a \u2018heinous crime\u2019. You offered your life at my feet, to do so as I pleased, didn\u2019t you?\u201d reminded Alexcent.\u201cPlease, My lord!\u201d pleaded Dajal, \u201cMy family has served you loyally. Please\u2026.\u201d\u201cI do so hate repeating myself,\u201d said Alexcent. He looked at Riereia. \u201cProceed.\u201dAran Bank belongs to Alexcent? Amethyst was dumbfounded. She had indeed wanted to expose the villainous monster and his deeds. But she had never really thought that he would be killed like this.\u201cWait!\u201d she shouted and stepped between Riereia and Dajal just as his blade lifted into the air. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said hurriedly, \u201cHe committed disgusting crimes worthy of death but you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d said Riereia awkwardly, lowering his blade to his side. Dajal, taking advantage of the situation as always, looked up at her with glistening eyes.\u201cAmethyst,\u201d Alexcent called to her, his voice dangerously low. Amethyst would do well not to cross him.She looked at him, straight in the face. \u201cHe has wronged me,\u201d she said, \u201cHe is my prisoner. I get to decide what to do with him.\u201d Alexcent narrowed his eyes at her. She looked at him, unwavering. \u201cDeath is just too lenient a punishment,\u201d she added.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Alexcent sighed. \u201cFine,\u201d he said finally, \u201cDo as you please.\u201d I can\u2019t believe I am relieved at saving this scum, thought Amethyst disgustedly.\u201cThank you, Madam,\u201d said Dajal, whimpering at her feet. His head bowed to the floor. \u201cThank you for saving my life.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me regret my decision,\u201d she said, anger flaring.\u201cNever, madam,\u201d said Dajal, \u201cThank you. I am eternally at your service.\u201d\u201cJust because I saved you from death doesn\u2019t mean I have forgiven you,\u201d said Amethyst distastefully, \u201cYou will receive a fair share of your punishment, I promise you that! In a certain country, the punishment for slush funds, bribery, and money laundering is to be boiled in a cauldron full of water.\u201d She made her way to Dajal. \u201cI have never seen that punishment executed before.\u201dAmethyst, grabbed him by his collar, and her hand swung towards his right cheek. \u201cThis is for all the maids you have assaulted, including me.\u201dThe slap sent him reeling to the floor. The sound rang through the office. Riereia, who stood a little to the side, scratched his own cheek as though he could feel the pain and whistled a low tune. Dajal cradled his right cheek and glared at Amethyst with arrogant eyes.\u201cThis is for Roman, who has tolerated you all this while,\u201d she retorted, as she grabbed him by the neck and swung her hands again, to land on his left cheek. He dropped to the floor, blood flying in spittle.Dajal, now covered both his cheeks in pain, a rivulet of blood escaping his lips. He looked at her so venomously, as though he wanted to pounce on her and beat her to death. Amethyst pulled all her might and kicked him between his legs.Dajal screamed in pain. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare show me those eyes,\u201d she yelled. \u201cThis is for what you tried to do to me, and what you have done to the maids all this while. You will, hereby, live like you are dead. You will not be permitted to speak to, or see anyone. You will rot in the dungeon for the rest of your life, repenting for your crimes.\u201d Amethyst looked at the knights. They obeyed. Buerre grabbed him by the hair and dragged him out of the office, and Riereia followed behind.\u201cEveryone out,\u201d commanded Alexcent. Pon and Gen left in silence. It was only Alexcent and Amethyst now.He was staring at her. She was unable to decide whether he was angry, amused, or annoyed. He finally spoke after a heartbeat, \u201cI will need some time to think\u2026 of your punishment.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Amethyst disbelievingly.\u201cDid you think I would let slide what happened today without consequence?\u201d he asked.Emile felt her anger flare. She had one or two things she needed clarified as well. She needed answers on why he let Dajal free, even when he knew everything. Didn\u2019t that make him as guilty?\u201cFine,\u201d she spat, \u201cI will take my time as well to think about your punishment.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Alexcent in a low voice. \u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d\u201cAs if you don\u2019t know!\u201d Amethyst threw her hands in the air. \u201cThe man I trusted. It was my folly to ever think you would amount to anything. I am so very mad at you I can\u2019t even look at you right now. I am going to go and change.\u201d She turned around and walked to the door.Amethyst quickly left the office. Thankfully, he did not attempt to stop her. After the taxing events of the day, she felt utterly exhausted that her legs started shaking. She was trembling. She steeled herself. She still would have to face and confront Alexcent later. His fury, his aggression, never seemed to end. He was never violent verbally or physically with her, but the sight of an angry man still scared her.Amethyst walked to her room and sat on her bed. She then headed to the bath when her legs and hand stopped shaking a little. She took off the maid uniform that she was still in. She wanted to get rid of these clothes that Dajal had touched. She wanted to scrub her skin raw, to forget his disgusting hands on her.The awful memory still caused goosebumps to rise on her skin. If he had arrived just a bit late\u2026. She shuddered, unwilling to think about it. Tears stung her eyes, and she wrapped her arms around herself for comfort. She rocked back and forth in the bath, trying to calm herself. It\u2019s okay now. Everything is fine now, she reminded herself, failing to believe it. Her nerves were frayed, and she felt on edge. She couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling of his cold, sharp, evil eyes. She turned the knob and warm water flowed in the bath.Dajal knew things about her he shouldn\u2019t have known. He had never come near the mansion, so it could only mean that there was a spy here. Maybe one of the maids acted as his source of information. I need to be more careful.He also seemed to be aware of the incident where Amethyst had reprimanded a knight from harassing a maid. Excluding the part of the mansion under Pon\u2019s care, Dajal seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere. In addition to all this, there was the matter of Aran Bank belonging to Alexcent. She felt betrayed and lied to. All the questions and thoughts and emotions raging in her mind made her feel nauseous.There was a knock on the bathroom door. \u201cYes?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d the maid said, from outside the bathroom door, \u201cHis Highness wishes to dine in the dining room tonight.\u201dUsually, she ate her food in her room. He had never commented or disapproved of it. The fact that he was informing her to have dinner in the dining room probably meant he was still angry and had no intention to come into their room tonight. She wasn\u2019t going to let it go. She was going to dress up and go have dinner with him in the dining room and have a calm conversation like rational adults.\u201cAlright,\u201d she said to the maid, \u201cWill you please lend me a hand? I am going to change and dine with him tonight.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said the maid. Amethyst got out of the bath and wore a robe. She went to her room where the maids had been waiting. They had laid out a simple, high-waisted dress that she preferred.\u201cNo, bring out the corset as well,\u201d she instructed. \u201cAs for the dress, I want something a little fancier tonight. The pale yellow one that I bought recently will do.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d replied the maid, as she brought out the dress Amethyst had indicatedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69She thought to herself as she soaked herself in.Dajal was aware of the fact that I don\u2019t enjoy wearing any undergarments. He who doesn\u2019t even come near the main mansion\u2026 Which could only mean that one of the maids acted as his source of information. I must pay more attention to my dressing and manner of speaking.He was also aware of the incident where she had reprimanded a knight for harassing a maid, so excluding the main mansion under Pon\u2019s care, there wasn\u2019t a part of the estate that didn\u2019t have Dajal\u2019s eyes and ears.And to add on, to think that Aran Bank belonged to Alec.The sound of water coming out from the showerhead failed to block out the noises in her head. Just when she started to feel nauseous from all the thoughts going on in her head.Knock, knock!She heard a knock on the door of the bathroom.\u201cYes.\u201dA maid relayed a message from outside of the bathroom.\u201cMadam, His Lordship wishes to dine in the dining room tonight.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dNormally, she ate at the table in her bedroom and he had never commented or disapproved of it. So for him to have dinner in the dining room could only mean that he was still angry, and had no intention of coming into the bedroom tonight.Let\u2019s not get emotional like before. And try to have a calm conversation\u2026She repeated to herself.\u201cAll right. I\u2019m done washing up and about to change so lend me a hand.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dThe maid called the other maids that were waiting and assisted Amethyst who had come out of the bathroom. They quickly prepared the usual high waisted silhouette and simple dress.\u201cNo, bring the corset as well. And for the dress, something more\u2026 fancy, right, the pale yellow dress I bought before will do.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dWith the help of the maids, Amethyst tightened the corset around her and wore the yellow dress she had recently bought. The dress tapered downwards, which accentuated the curves of her hips and waist.This should do, thought Amethyst. She was ready to face Alexcent a second time. She looked at Alexcent, who was already at the dining table looking comfortable. He was wearing black pants, and a white shirt with a few buttons undone, which revealed his Adam\u2019s apple and his collarbone.She felt her heart race. She tried to take her eyes off from his collarbone and looked at the whiskey in his hand. He was seated at the head of the long table. When he saw Amethyst approach, he seemed taken aback. But he took a sip from the glass he was holding and pretended to maintain a calm composure.The room was throbbing with tension, as though even a spark could make both explode at any time. Amethyst sat facing him at the other end of the table, instead of next to him. She thought she saw him attempting a smile, but it could have been her imagination. He indicated to Pon to serve the food.Pon served the food with all grace and elegance. Amethyst looked at the food in front of her. It was steak. He must have instructed the chef to prepare her favourite food, maybe to placate her and have the upper hand in this confrontation. It was prepared almost lovingly with her favorite sauce. Damn it, she cursed.Amethyst pretended to be unfazed. She took up the fork and the knife and sliced her meat. The aroma was irresistible, and it made some of her anxiety melt away. Alexcent was quick to notice this.\u201cSo, tell me,\u201d he said, taking advantage of the situation, \u201cWhat are you angry about?\u201d\u201cYou first,\u201d retorted Amethyst.Alexcent heaved a sigh. \u201cAsh,\u201d he said wearily, \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to provoke me. I am already holding back, as it is.\u201d\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped, \u201cWere you aware of all the tyranny that Dajal committed on the maids?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.\u201cAnd you had ample evidence of his crimes,\u201d she added.\u201cYes,\u201d he replied.\u201cThen why?\u201d asked Amethyst, \u201cTell me why you didn\u2019t take any action against him?\u201d\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201dAmethyst was stunned. \u201cHe was committing a crime, you daft dimbo,\u201d she retorted.\u201cHis crimes led him to keep the slush funds safe in my bank, where they belong,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cAh, in the end, it is all because of money!\u201d said Amethyst venomously, \u201cAran Bank and all its glorious black money. I am not even surprised that there is such a bank under your name. What about the maids? How could you keep quiet about that and do nothing?\u201d\u201cDid any of them find it important to report to me about it?\u201d asked Alexcent, coldly.How could he ask that? Amethyst thought in anger. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, unable to fathom his words.\u201cAll of them tolerated his tyranny,\u201d he said in a dead-pan voice, \u201cIf even one of them had reported it to me, I would have taken swift action. I couldn\u2019t punish him without receiving complaints or accusations. He would have just accused me of \u2018exploitation of power\u2019 instead. Without the victims coming forward, I had no reason to take action.\u201d\u201cBut you had the evidence!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cYou knew everything! Don\u2019t try the \u2018victim-blaming\u2019 with me. You think the maids had a choice. You saw what happened today. The same thing happened to them whenever they tried to report it! You had a choice. You had the authority, and you did nothing.\u201d Her voice was etched with disappointment.\u201cAsh\u2026,\u201d said Alexcent softly, \u201cWhy are you so worried about them? They are just employees on contract working beneath us. Don\u2019t get so sentimental.\u201d\u201cThen I suppose I am no different to you,\u201d she retorted, angrily, \u201cSince you and I have a similar contract.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026,\u201d he said, \u201cAsh, you are different from them.\u201d\u201cNo I am not,\u201d she snapped, \u201cI am also a woman who has nothing here except being tied to that contract so you have to protect me like you did today. You are the one responsible for me, as you are for them! Your \u2018employees\u2019 will be here longer than me. I will disappear in a year. You should pay attention and take up your responsibilities more seriously with them.\u201d\u201cDisappear?\u201d said Alexcent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Amethyst saw rage in his eyes. Now she had blurted it out, there was no going back. \u201cYes!\u201d she added, \u201cI am tied to you on a contract. Perhaps you will find it in your heart to dispose of me so coldly like your \u2018employees\u2019 then. This is what scares me. You being so cold and willing to brush the matter off. You scare me.\u201dIt was true. Amethyst was scared of Alexcent. She wasn\u2019t scared of him physically hurting her. But she was constantly scared that she meant nothing to him, that she was disposable as other people he was so indifferent towards. She couldn\u2019t bear looking at him anymore, so she looked down at the steak on her plate.Meanwhile, her words hit Alexcent like ice pricks through his heart. He flinched. He knew she would be gone by next year, and he wasn\u2019t able to comprehend why it affected him so much. Although one thing was perfectly clear, he didn\u2019t want her to be frightened of him. To her, at the least, he didn\u2019t want to appear a monster.\u201cAsh\u2026,\u201d he called. Only silence greeted him. \u201cAsh, please,\u201d he tried again.\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\u201cLook at me,\u201d he urged. She turned to face him with a massive effort on her part. \u201cI apologise,\u201d he said gently, \u201cI am sorry. It was wrong of me. I will take care if something like this happens in the future.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d said Amethyst, surprised.\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he said.Amethyst felt like a heavy weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She was about to smile but knew that there were other things they had to settle first. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, confused.\u201cYou were mad at me,\u201d she said in hesitation, \u201cYou said you wanted to punish me.\u201dShe wondered what kind of punishment he had in store for her. Somebody who didn\u2019t hesitate to kill could only have so many brutalities that he didn\u2019t mind committing. Is he going to end the contract? Amethyst was afraid.Alexcent looked at her trembling hands that she tried so hard to hide from his view. He could never \u2018punish\u2019 her. He had never meant it frighteningly. He had been furious that the bastard had tried to force himself on her. He had been infuriated with Amethyst too, for putting herself in danger like that. But seeing her bruised neck, still with imprints of the bastard\u2019s fingerprints and her sore wrist, his anger at her was replaced with an ache in his heart. How in hell can I punish her when none of it is her fault? He sighed.\u201cIf you ever put yourself in danger so recklessly,\u201d he began, thinking that it would be enough to just remind her how worried and helpless she had made him feel, \u201cI will crush your head myself.\u201d He looked at her levelly, not hiding how infuriated he was with her for being so impulsive.\u201cFine,\u201d she shot back, \u201cI will be careful if you will be more responsible. But if you ever try to crush my head, I will stab you with this same fork.\u201d She stabbed the meat for emphasis.Alexcent blinked and burst out laughing. She never fails to surprise me, he thought between his mirth. Amethyst wasn\u2019t joking, her eyes were determined and sincere. Pon swallowed dryly, hearing his master laugh like that. He wondered if anybody had ever survived after saying something so bold to him before. Nobody, in his opinion, had survived such kind of laughter.\u201cCome here,\u201d said Alexcent to Amethyst.\u201cNo,\u201d Amethyst shot back. She wasn\u2019t so easy that he would order her around and she would run to his arms. He needed to learn his lesson. She focused on cutting her meat.\u201cCome here, Ash,\u201d he said softly.\u201cNo,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cDon\u2019t order me around like I am your dog. You come here if you want to meet me so badly.\u201d She continued her attack at the meat on her plate, nonchalantly.Pon was terrified. But Alexcent smirked and got out of his seat. He walked slowly over to her and stood before her. She tried to focus more on the meat on her plate. He knelt down so he could look at her.\u201cAsh,\u201d he called her name softly. Amethyst put her cutlery down and turned to look at him. As her eyes met his, her fear melted away. The anxiety and helplessness she had felt after Dajal had tried to assault her, the fear she had felt from him. Everything melted away. She felt safe. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him to her in an embrace, tears pricking her eyes. Soon, she was crying, her tears streaming down in rivulets on her cheeks. She finally felt unburdened and relieved. It seemed like this was all she had needed. An embrace from him and everything was fine.\u201cI was so scared,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t arrived, I don\u2019t know what would have happened. I was so scared.\u201d\u201cAsh\u2026,\u201d he said softly, returning her hug.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2026,\u201d she sobbed, unable to continue.\u201cShhh,\u201d he said, tenderly, stroking her hair, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You are safe now.\u201d She snuggled deeper into his arms and he held her, gently. He lifted her into his arms and left the dining room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Alexcent took Amethyst, still in his arms, to their bedroom and laid her down on the bed tenderly. He wiped her tears and held her tightly. He then placed a gentle kiss on her lips. Amethyst, who had been too exhausted before, now kissed him with passion. As the kiss became deeper, Alexcent stripped off her dress only to be greeted with another obstruction on his way to her soft skin.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked, surprised.\u201cWell, as you can see,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cIt\u2019s a corset.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d he said, \u201cBut why?\u201d She never wore a corset because she didn\u2019t like them.\u201cI thought it would make me appear more demure for today,\u201d she said, smiling.\u201cAll of a sudden, you are trying to be \u2018demure\u2019\u201d he said, smirking.\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she said, embarrassed, \u201cYou suddenly took me to the bedroom, I didn\u2019t even get a time to change, did I?\u201d\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said. She hesitated. Alexcent, in his impatience, leaned over her, extended his arms and untied the corset which fell down, revealing her chest.Amethyst blushed and tried to cover her chest with her hands before looking up at him. His red eyes looked at her, full of desire. She felt her heart racing. Her embarrassment was forgotten, as it was replaced by the same desire he felt.She felt his eyes all over her. The feeling of danger that she had felt ever since she was almost assaulted, turned into lust when she looked at him. She pulled him to her and placed her lips against his. His tongue caressed her own and invaded the sides of her mouth. He placed tender kisses all over her body.\u201cHmm,\u201d she mumbled. She felt moans threatening to escape her throat as he became aggressive with his kisses.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold back,\u201d he whispered in her ears.\u201cBut it\u2019s embarrassing if anybody hears us,\u201d she responded with difficulty.\u201cNo one can hear us,\u201d he said, kissing her in her most intimate parts, which sent a shiver of pleasure through her body. He gently bit her inner thigh.\u201cWhat about the knight you posted outside to guard me?\u201d she asked, biting her lips.He laughed. \u201cOh, Ash,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with you sometimes.\u201d He pulled her down gently, so he was on top of her. He looked down at her face, eyes full of passion. \u201cWhen I am with you, they aren\u2019t guarding you anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused.\u201cWell, I am strong enough to protect you,\u201d he smirked. She wanted to wipe the smirk off his face. \u201cBut if you want, I can order them to stand guard outside, your moans are just too beautiful for my ears only,\u201d he said jokingly.Amethyst blushed to the roots of her hair. She bit the tip of his nose. \u201cOw, Ash!\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for teasing me,\u201d said Amethyst, pouting.\u201cI wasn\u2019t teasing. If you want, I\u2014\u201d\u201cAlec!\u201d she cut him off. She glared at him for a moment before she placed her lips on his. Their kiss grew frantic and soon Amethyst was crouching on her hands and knees, as Alexcent thrust from behind. She had nothing else to focus on, except the primal pleasure that she felt from the act and gave in to it.She felt the ripples of pleasure rising from where he entered her. He must have screamed in pleasure as she came. Her knees were tired, they felt sore. She heard him grunt in ecstasy. He seemed especially involved today.\u201cAlec, I can\u2019t anymore,\u201d she said, gasping.\u201cWe are far from done, sweetheart,\u201d he said in between irregular breaths.\u201cNo, Alec,\u201d she said, \u201cStop.\u201d He stopped his thrust and wrapped his arms around her as her knees gave way. Warm fluid flowed from between her legs. Normally, he would carry her to the bathroom and draw her a bath. But today, he let her lie down. He picked up some clothes from the floor and wiped her with it. He laid her down and buried his head in her neck.Amethyst was far from peaceful, her thoughts raged in her mind. She wondered if she had never seen that maid, would she ever have so recklessly done what she did? But she had no regrets. She needed to find someone new and capable to take up Dajal\u2019s place who would sincerely fulfill their duties and see to the neglected facilities. After all, she was the one that had dug up the mess. She would fix it.She determined to never let her inaction cause suffering for others. She wouldn\u2019t let history repeat itself. She had only known how to photocopy machines and sort out documents. She would have to learn a lot to fit the position of a manager. One step at a time, she thought.\u201cAlec,\u201d she called.\u201cHmm,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat can I even do in this place?\u201d she asked.\u201cAsh, you are my wife,\u201d he said softly, \u201cThis is our mansion. There is nothing you can\u2019t do here. Hush now and go to sleep.\u201d\u201cGoodnight, Alec,\u201d she said as she felt her eyes droop from exhaustion. She fell asleep in Alec\u2019s arms. But her sleep wasn\u2019t serene, many thoughts raged in her mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Pon and Lunia seemed a little shocked to see Amethyst in the office. She had decided that if she was to do a good job of managing everything, she needed help.\u201cPon,\u201d she said.\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Pon.\u201cCould you show me the documents that you showed me recently?\u201d she asked.\u201cOf course, Madam,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought you might look for them, so I already had them prepared.\u201dPon was a very efficient butler. After the incident with Dajal, he was certain that she would expect him to show her every information and oversee the matters of the household. He had prepared everything ahead of time.Amethyst scanned the documents he handed to her. Even at first glance, she could make out the problem and the numerous leakages. She had a habit of keeping a track of her expenses as a spending log; she had been doing it for the past ten years. Hence, it wasn\u2019t very difficult to skim through the pages and understand the problem.\u201cPon, and Lunia,\u201d she addressed them, \u201cI am sure you are aware about yesterday\u2019s incident. Dajal\u2019s post is vacant as of now and there are numerous flaws that need attention. Which is why, I will require your assistance in this matter.\u201d\u201cOf course, Madam,\u201d said Pon.\u201cAlways at your service,\u201d said Lunia.\u201cI am going to address a few issues present here,\u201d she indicated the document, \u201cBut I am not sure I am fully ready to take over the matters of the household. So your assistance and support will be much appreciated.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Madam,\u201d said Pon and Lunia, unanimously.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Amethyst. \u201cI see you issue new uniforms every week?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Pon, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cWhy so? It seems like a waste,\u201d she said.\u201cThe staff serve you and the Lord in close proximity,\u201d Pon explained, \u201cClean and fresh uniforms are of utmost importance.\u201d\u201cEven so, a new uniform once a week is very extravagant,\u201d she said, \u201cLet\u2019s provide three uniforms for a person when they join, with some extra clothes. That would be enough until the uniforms become worn or damaged. After that, I will pay for the new ones.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d\u201cOh, and this here,\u201d she said, pointing to a particular entry which showed a huge amount of expenses, \u201cThis is a very great amount for some bulk purchase. What is this for?\u201d\u201cWe bulk purchase our cleaning tools and equipment, Madam.\u201d\u201cWe spend this amount of money just for cleaning?\u201d she asked.\u201cCorrect, Madam.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d she said, stunned, \u201cI know that this is a Prince\u2019s Mansion, but to think we splurge so much on just cleaning\u2026.\u201d\u201cThank you, Madam,\u201d said Pon.\u201cPon, it wasn\u2019t a compliment!\u201d she said, \u201cThis is a waste.\u201dPon looked disappointed. \u201cMy apologies, Madam,\u201d he said, \u201cBut to maintain cleanliness, we dispose of the rags and tools after use.\u201d\u201cHow many rags and cleaning equipment could we possibly need?\u201d asked Amethyst, flabbergasted. She wanted to let out a curse, but she composed herself. \u201cWe can reuse the rags and other cleaning tools,\u201d she explained, \u201cAs for cleanliness, the tools and the rags can be boiled to sanitize them. Even better, we can use lemon while boiling, it has anti-bacterial as well as whitening effect. That way we can reduce wasting resources.\u201d\u201cSo, we boil the rags after use?\u201d asked Pon for confirmation.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cWe can prepare a large pot and mix in lemon or white vinegar with water, and boil the rags after use to sanitize them. Instruct the maids on this. It will be much more resourceful. We can buy new ones if the rags and tools become damaged or unusable.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Pon, \u201cUnderstood. I will do so.\u201d\u201cThis part is clearly a waste, so reduce the purchase of this,\u201d said Amethyst, indicating the unnecessary expenses. \u201cHere, and here as well.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Pon.Soon the huge pile of documents reduced to only several pages that needed to be attended to. \u201cI think that should do for now, regarding the household expenses,\u201d she said, picking up another file on the table marked \u2018Employees Welfare\u2019.\u201cI heard a maid was fired from her job because she was pregnant,\u201d she said, as she leafed through the document. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cThey leave voluntarily, Madam,\u201d said Pon, \u201cThey find it hard to continue the work in such circumstances, so they leave.\u201d\u201cIt is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 Pon,\u201d she said, \u201cI think the unfeasible circumstances implicitly force them to resign from their jobs. From this day forth, anyone pregnant will be given half a year of maternity leave which will, of course, be paid. They will also be allowed two years of postpartum parental leave. They will, of course, be paid during this time. If they choose to return to work, they will be given flexible working hours. It is hard as it is for working mothers.\u201d\u201cWill these all come under paid leave?\u201d asked Pon, surprised.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cWe will of course pay them the full wage for the maternity leave of half a year. They will be paid a full wage for the first year of their postpartum parental leave and 80% for the next year. I will pay them the remaining 20% if they are willing to return to work. Why do you ask? Do we not have enough budget for this?\u201d\u201cWe have ample budget, Madam,\u201d said Pon, respectfully, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 nobody has thought of the welfare of the employees in such a manner before.\u201d\u201cWell, someone having to leave their jobs just because they are pregnant seems very brutal, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, absentmindedly, still turning the pages of the document in her hand.\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d agreed Pon, wholeheartedly.\u201cWill you be so kind as to call Roman for me?\u201d she asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73\u201cShe works outside the main mansion. Bring her to me, I need her.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d Pon turned and left the office. He barked a short instruction to someone outside then returned to Amethyst to hear what else she had to say.\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Amethyst said in a serious tone, \u201cI want strict reinforcement for the punishment of any form of harassment. Sexual harassment in particular. I once saw a group of knights harassing a maid and it was this incident that Dajal used to soil my reputation.\u201d\u201cI understand that Knight-Commander Sir Wheel has already dealt with the situation,\u201d Pon said.Amethyst raised an eyebrow, \u201cDealt with?\u201d\u201cYes, he suspended the knight and reduced his pay.\u201d\u201cThen the punishment for dismissal will be enforced.\u201d\u201cDismissal?\u201d Pon tilted his head in question, \u201cBut that may cause a severe backlash.\u201d\u201cAmong all forms of violence, sexual violation is one of, if not the most serious crime. It is lowly and despicable. Such acts will not be tolerated within the walls of this mansion,\u201d Amethyst\u2019s voice was stony, the weight of her words heavy in the air. \u201cThis is not a matter of right or wrong, it\u2019s a matter of basic humanity and morality. Those that do not agree may leave.\u201d\u201cYes, Madame. Understood,\u201d Pon found he had to agree. Amethyst had a point.\u201cRegardless of status, staff or knights,\u201d Amethyst continued, \u201cif anyone is ever found harassing another who is in a weaker position, they will receive punishment that is swift and ruthless. Please see that this is known along with the welfare statement.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Pon asked in surprise.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dPon shook his head, \u201cNo, Madame. I just assumed you would be delivering this news yourself. Wouldn\u2019t that send a stronger message?\u201d\u201cAs you know, there are those who have seen me when I was disguised as a maid. Forgive me if I am hesitant to stand before them and act as the Lady of the House now. Just as there are those who think well of me, there are others who think otherwise. Anyway, I don\u2019t fancy being a topic of gossip as the lady who wore a maid\u2019s uniform,\u201d she waved her hand to dismiss her other thoughts. \u201cEven though I am certain they wouldn\u2019t pass their comments in front of me.\u201d\u201cMy apologised for my oversight,\u201d Pon dipped his head.\u201cAnd see to it that the rules apply to both genders. Punishment will be meted out to both men and women.\u201d\u201cExcuse my ignorance, but women\u2026?\u201d\u201cWoman can harass men just as well as men can harass women. It\u2019s called reverse discrimination,\u201d Amethyst explained patiently.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. The heavier the penalty, the more mindful they will be of their actions. It is important to ensure we give them no reason to disobey,\u201d Amethyst\u2019s voice trailed off, \u201cThis will require more thought. I would like a sort of manual, a rulebook to be exact. Do we have anyone well-versed in such a field? I feel it would be good to hold regular talks and training as one of the prevention methods.\u201d\u201cI will look into it,\u201d Pon replied.It was only once she\u2019d finished speaking that Emelis realized Pon had taken out a notepad and pen and started jotting down all the things she\u2019d said.Their attention was drawn to the door when two stiff knocks echoed through the room. Emelis knew who it was.\u201cRoman, please come in!\u201d she called.Roman entered and stood at attention, \u201cYes, Madame? You called?\u201d\u201cI have a favour to ask, do listen to it, please.\u201d Amethyst said.Roman gave a nod.For the first time since she\u2019d taken the position as Lady of the House, Amethyst\u2019s office was occupied with a very human warmth. It was pleasant.\u201cNow that Roman is here,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to discuss the operations of the main and separate quarters. I no longer wish for them to operate separately.\u201dRoman nodded again. Pon scribbled away on his notepad.\u201cI also intend to draw up a schedule so that you work in groups. 5 members per group will be placed in different locations that are to be rotated every three months. I am sure everyone is familiar with the way things work. I don\u2019t expect there to be any problems.\u201dAmethyst had been working for 10 years already. and even though this was a small company, she knew how to operate it efficiently. She picked up a piece of paper and started drawing up a plan.\u201cMadame,\u201d Pon said, breaking his attentive silence, \u201cyou said every three months. May I ask why?\u201d\u201cIf you work in one area long enough you become lazy, complacent and incompetent,\u201d Amethyst replied without looking up. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to make sure there is no confusion when it comes to the sudden absence of anyone. If someone is absent for a long period of time, whether the issues be health or personal, the vacancy must be filled to ensure maximum efficiency.\u201dPon nodded then remember she wasn\u2019t looking at him and replied with a respectful, \u201cUnderstood, Madame.\u201d\u201cI also want the members of the groups to be organized on a rotational basis. The same five group members cannot be grouped together too long. Yes, it will be complicated at first, but I am certain with time everyone will get used to it,\u201d finally, she looked up.Amethyst was met with the attentive eyes of the people before her, all waiting for what she would say next. \u201cLastly, I want to appoint a leader. No matter how strategically we split the groups and assign the people, there will always be problems. For this position of leader, Roman, I would like to appoint you,\u201d Amethyst nodded at Roman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Roman was stunned to silence. She blinked rapidly in surprise and worked her mouth like a fish out of water until she was finally able to utter a faint, \u201cSorry? Me?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Amethyst said without hesitation, \u201cDo you perhaps have someone else in mind?\u201dThe question was not a hard one to answer.\u201cNo, Madame,\u201d Roman managed.Lunia, who had been silent throughout the entire conversation, finally spoke up, \u201cI too think Roman is a good match for the position.\u201d\u201cMadame,\u201d Roman spluttered, \u201cI am not a suitable candidate. I beg of you to look for someone else.\u201dAmethyst fixed Roman with a contemplative look, \u201cPlease explain.\u201dRoman summoned her courage, \u201cFirstly, I am not familiar with the workings of the main mansion.\u201d\u201cPon will see to that. Right Pon?\u201d Amethyst glanced at him.\u201cOf course,\u201d Pon said with more enthusiasm than he felt. He\u2019d thought that with Amethyst finally stepping into her role of Lady of the House, his workload would lift somewhat. It appeared he was mistaken and he had to admit; he was disappointed.\u201cI\u2019ve only done cleaning in the past!\u201d Roman countered, \u201cI\u2019ve never been in charge of anyone before.\u201d\u201cLunia will teach you what you need to know,\u201d Amethyst replied calmly, never once giving any indication that she was going to back down.\u201cYes, Madame but,\u201d Lunia fumbled as she was drawn back to reality. She\u2019d been so caught up in her resentment she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been glaring. She already had enough to deal with being Amethyst\u2019s personal secretary, she didn\u2019t need to add to her burdens by mentoring Roman as well. She managed to swallow her protest and pass it off with a light shrug. \u201cOf course,\u201d she answered instead, internally berating herself for falling to such a petty trap.Roman refused to give in, \u201cEven so\u2026\u201d\u201cRoman,\u201d Amethyst cut in, her voice softened, \u201cI know how stressful it is to be responsible for others. It\u2019s hard knowing that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you work, you can never please everyone and it will never be enough.\u201d\u201cThen why me?\u201d Roman deflated a little, allowing her shoulders to slump forward.\u201cYou have the qualities of someone for this position. You are honest, you are responsible\u2026\u201dRoman shook her head slowly, \u201cJust because I\u2019m honest doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m good.\u201dAmethyst gave a small smile, \u201cAgreed, but you have shown me you can persevere through anything. For the last 10 years you relentlessly faced every hardship head-on. You never gave up, and that is reason enough. And anyway,\u201d she returned to her business-like manner, \u201cthe prince as agreed that honesty is one of the leading characteristics for this role.\u201dRoman looked up, \u201cSo you trust me?\u201d\u201cOf course. If I don\u2019t trust you, who can I trust? So, from now,\u201d Amethyst said formally, \u201cyou are the Appointed Manager of the side mansion. Do your best, please.\u201d\u201cMadame\u2026\u201d Roman trailed off as her words failed her again, \u201cThank you\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d she choked on the last word. Her emotion didn\u2019t stem from the fact that she had just been promoted, it was more that Madame trusted her. Madame\u2019s trust alone was compensation for the hardships she had faced for the last 10 years. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say thing else.\u201cI know you are going to do a wonderful job,\u201d Amethyst said in the comforting tone of someone who already knew what lay in wait, \u201cI have full faith in you.\u201dRoman left without another word.As Pon was making ready to leave, Amethyst called him, \u201cPon, I am thinking of shopping tomorrow. Call the merchants, will you?\u201dPon blinked in confusion, \u201cMerchants?\u201d\u201cYes, Alec said I should shop within the mansion.\u201dThis was an excuse. It was more for the sake of comfort than anything else. She was used to shopping online to accommodate her busy schedule.\u201cAh yes. Which should I call, Madame? There is a large variety of categories.\u201d\u201cFrom A to B. All of them,\u201d Amethyst said.\u201cI will contact only the best,\u201d Pon replied. He managed to cover his surprise at her request. He had thought the Lady of the House was uninterested in appearances, he must have been mistaken.\u201cAnd an arms dealer. Guns and swords to be precise.\u201dThis time Pon was unable to conceal his shock.Amethyst said no more, only gave him a smile and nod.Pon took this as his cue to leave.Amethyst was left alone in her office. She was starkly reminded of her workings day. Even though the company had had a welfare system, it had never been anything but a rumour to her back then. This was something that had to change. Here in her own company was a start, even if she couldn\u2019t change the entire social system.As she idly gazed around the room, her thoughts wondered to how being pregnant could make someone feel like one of the lowest ranked members of society. Being pregnant was meant to be a joyous, special time, not one fraught with fear and hardships. And this wasn\u2019t counting the stress one received from their manager and disapproving colleagues. Rotating between kindergartens, nurseries, one\u2019s mother-in-law and own mother was no way for a mother to raise money and no way for a child to live. For her, maternity had been nothing more than a dream and paid maternity leave nothing short of a miracle.This was Amethyst\u2019s driving force, this was what had inspired her to become the standard for the other nobles. She knew it was a process, things wouldn\u2019t change immediately but word would spread, as it is prone to do, especially through employees, and this would draw more people to work at the prince\u2019s mansion. By pure ripple effect, this would impact the other noble families who would have to do something to keep up.If such a small change was possible, if it could change the lives of some people even just a little, then it was enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Amethyst was doubtless there would be a phase of trial and error. She\u2019d gauged about a year for her plans to come to fruition. And then, when she wasn\u2019t around, things would run smoothly without her influence.She rested her hands on the table, her thoughts spinning themselves through her head. She had to get Alec to promise that he would never again neglect his people. He had an obligation to protect them.She slumped to imitate Alec\u2019s posture when he was in his own office.She had always held dear the saying, \u2018Those that do not work, deserve no food.\u2019 And she had worked, so it was time for her food. It was time for her reward.Then her thoughts turned to the time when she had taken a break from work to care for her newborn. Her life had changed then. The Americano coffee she used to buy from her favorite coffee shop had turned into instant coffee, which she stopped drinking anyway. Her chocolates and macarons changed to diapers and milk powders. Even though she didn\u2019t have much money left to spend on herself, she still found it selfish and wasteful to indulge in her own pleasures. She saved everything she had, reminding herself that a good cup of coffee was a pack of diapers for a few days. She made sure her children only had the best, ate only the best food, spared no expense on them while neglecting her own happiness.Whenever the money had run out, she\u2019d felt awful asking her husband for more.She was a mother; it was obligation to raise her children.She a housewife; it was her responsibility to do the housework.Even though raising a child and keeping a home was already a colossal task, she had lived in a society where being a housewife was seen as being free and jobless.Or perhaps the ideas had come from watching her own mother while she\u2019d been growing up, perhaps it had been the stereotypical mother roles portrayed in the dramas she\u2019d watched on TV that she\u2019d reinforced into her subconsciousness.After she\u2019d married, she\u2019d been shaped to fit the moulds of mother and wife which was why she\u2019d splurged on the luxuries in the mansion. But things were going to change.Amethyst knew she wasn\u2019t the perfect idea of what a Lady of the House should be, but she contented herself with the knowledge that she had done enough to deserve her reward.\u201cWell,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cmy reward isn\u2019t exactly grand. I am too humble with myself,\u201d she tapped her fingers against the desk then stood.She deserved her reward, she just had to go and fetch it.*\u201cGive it to me.\u201d Amethyst demanded as she barged into Alec\u2019s office.Alexcent sat up in his chair, then relaxed once he realized it was her, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She snapped, \u201cThe money Darla has been stealing all this time. You said it\u2019s all in that grand Aran Bank.\u201dAlec met her glare and acid words calmly, \u201cWhat do you plan to use all that money on?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean use?\u201d Amethyst spat, \u201cIt belongs to the employees and will be rightfully returned to them. Give it back.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d Alec muttered, \u201cHow would you like it then? Check? Cash? Gold?\u201dAmethyst was mute with fury. How could he be so brazen? How could he be so\u2026 detestable. Yes, he was detestable. Then again, he was someone who could turn a blind eye to all the corruption at Aran Bank.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do thing,\u201d she snapped, \u201cThe money will be used to repair the damaged facilities and paid back to the employees from which it was stolen. All you have to do is put it somewhere in your legally operated bank. Lunia is going to help Roman with that. Just give them the account.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Alec replied, his tone cool and level.\u201cAnd another thing. Now that you are in the position of duke, I want you to comply with all the moral obligations that come with it,\u201d Amethyst said.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d he said with feigned innocence.\u201cDon\u2019t you ever be a bystander when others are being debased and harassed. Don\u2019t you ever turn a blind eye to those that choose to remain silent,\u201d she seethed, \u201cYou will protect them. Don\u2019t forget it is your duty to protect them.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will,\u201d Alec replied, but his words were hollow and emotionless.With that said, Alexcent lifted his pen and continued with his paperwork.That\u2019s it? Is that all he has to say? she thought as the rage ebbed within her.She supposed he had no real reason to say anything more, he was under no obligation to.Is it too much for me to wish he would tell me more? Like why he owes Aran Bank? How much black money goes in and out of that place? How is he involved in such a business? For how long will be own that cursed place\u2026?Amethyst wanted to voice the questions that burned within her, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to voice them. She had no right to ask.She felt her heart constrict painfully. She couldn\u2019t understand why, which was what made her so angry. Instead of saying anything, she turned and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76After Amethyst left, Alexcent let out a sigh of relief and put down his pen. She\u2019d stared at him for such a long time.\u201cDammit\u2026!\u201d he said softly.Regarding Aran Bank, that had been a mistake. But then again, had it really?Amethyst didn\u2019t say Aran Bank was his. But she was right. While it was legal, it wasn\u2019t an honourable place. It wasn\u2019t dangerous for him and he didn\u2019t have to worry, even if the notorious Fidorun Bank found out Aran Bank was actually his\u2026Alexcent shook his head. He didn\u2019t want to worry about that either. \u201cI hope you can just move on and forget about it,\u201d he whispered to the place Amethyst had been standing at.It was this side of her personality that always made him wonder. He\u2019d already seen too much of it. No matter, someone had to be silenced.\u201cPon!\u201d Alexcent called out loudly.Soon, the butler entered the office and waited expectantly.\u201cSend Jen in,\u201d Alexcent said.\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Pon replied with a bow and left.Alexcent didn\u2019t have to wait long for Jen to arrive in his office.\u201cYou sent for me, Sir?\u201d Jen said.\u201cDid you slit his throat?\u201d\u201cYes, just as you said. I made it look like a simple accident.\u201d\u201cGood,\u201d Alexcent said sternly, \u201cI hope he\u2019s naturally disposed of.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Jen said with a dip of the head, \u201cNo one suspected any foul play.\u201dIt was the night before. After Alexcent left Amethyst\u2019s bedroom, he had summoned Jen to his office.\u201cBring me his head, now!\u201d His cold voice rang throughout the silent night.\u201cBeg your pardon, Sir, who? Do you mean\u2026 Dajal?\u201d Jen hesitantly asked.\u201cWhose else? Your own? Are you going to bring me your head? That will suffice as well.\u201dJen hurriedly replied before the duke got any ideas, \u201cNo! No, no Sir\u2026 No that, it\u2019s just\u2026 Didn\u2019t Lady Amethyst say she\u2019d spare him? I thought Your Imperial Highness gave permission to let him go?\u201d\u201cTake care of him,\u201d Alexcent said coldly.That was that. The duke couldn\u2019t simply let him go that easily.\u201cAnd how should I do it, Sir?\u201d Jen asked.Alexcent traced his finger over his desk, slowly and calmly, \u201cIt is a shame to just kill him\u2026 But there is no other choice. Make so that if his body is later discovered, it should seem like an accident. She mustn\u2019t suspect anything.\u201d\u201cRight. Understood, Sir.\u201dAlexcent\u2019s only regret was that he couldn\u2019t kill Dajal with his own two hands. He would just have to be satisfied with this. There was still a bruise on Amethyst\u2019s neck from the incident. It made his blood boil that he couldn\u2019t squeeze Dajal\u2019s neck until it was bruised as well, and then simply tear his head off his shoulders.Jen closed his eyes against the seething wrath once again bubbling within, \u201cYour Excellency, please take it easy.\u201d\u201cGet your ass out of here, if you\u2019re going to talk to me like that, Jen!\u201d Alexcent furiously roared. There was no room for negotiation, his decision was final.\u201cSir?\u201d Jen said, tilting his head in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Wring his neck! Now!\u201d Alexcent bellowed.Jen flinched, more to placate Alexcent\u2019s fury than anything else. \u201cYour Excellency, please\u2026 Lady Amethyst is not feeling well. If she sees you like this she will pass out.\u201d If he didn\u2019t calm this royalty down before the mistress came in, Jen feared the duke would snap his neck in front of everyone.As he stood there before the duke, it dawned on Jen that he probably shouldn\u2019t have listened to Alexcent in the first place.A few days before Dajal\u2019s confession of his crime, Alexcent had known of his wife\u2019s little mission. He discovered it through his loyal servant, Jen.That day, a noise of surprise escaped Alexcent as he finished rummaging Jen\u2019s mountain of papers. He found a note in a gap between the documents that were being approved\u2026\u201cYour Excellency, what are you doing?\u201d Jen asked.Alexcent\u2019s forehead creased with an unnamed emotion as he picked up the paper and unfolded it. The moment his eyes scanned over the words, he jumped up from his seat, leaving Jen to sit there looking at him in confusion. He made for the door, the note clutched tightly in his hand, but he didn\u2019t get far.Jen grabbed him from behind and held him. \u201cSir! Please wait! Just a second!\u201dAlexcent fought against him furiously, \u201cHow dare you say that! How dare you say that after what I\u2019ve just read!\u201d\u201cBut this\u2026 This is Lady Amethyst\u2019s decision!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexcent seethed, still trying to wrest himself from Jen\u2019s hold. \u201cThis is madness!\u201d\u201cSir,\u201d Jen said stubbornly, \u201cthe authority over the internal affairs of the duke\u2019s mansion is strictly Lady Amethyst\u2019s.\u201dAlexcent bristled. \u201cAre you\u2026 She\u2019s wearing a maid\u2019s uniform! Or were you unaware?\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Jen started to protest but flinched away from Alexcent\u2019s violent anger.\u201cGet out of my\u2026!\u201d\u201cFor what? What are you going to say?\u201d Jen stood before the furious duke.\u201cI\u2019m going there, I\u2019m going there right now!\u201d Alexcent tried to push past Jen.Jen stopped him with equal obstinacy. \u201cGoing there to say what? This maid is my lady, my wife?\u201dAlexcent\u2019s mouth formed as if to say something but it came out as a simple, \u201cWhat?\u201d instead.\u201cOr are you going to nit-pick over why Lady Amethyst can\u2019t call you her man and husband?\u201dAlexcent, who was beginning to calm, suddenly flared up again. \u201cWhat the hell is this!\u201dJen could see he\u2019d touched a nerve. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going there to do any of the above, leave her be, Sir. Lady Amethyst isn\u2019t asking for help. If you go there in this state, she, not you, will be disregarded and disobeyed by her subordinates.\u201d\u201cWho would dare to disregard the wife of a duke!\u201dJen raised his hands to placate the fuming royalty. \u201cThey\u2019re not disregarding her now\u2026 They\u2019re taking care of her. It\u2019s all in her hands, her power, of how this situation will pan out. And depending on the outcome of the said situation, the maids and servants might do their best to ignore her. So, I implore you, Your Excellency, please wait.\u201d He reasoned with his raging master.Alexcent gritted his teeth, biting back the fresh fury. \u201cWhat if she gets hurt\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve sent out the Shadows, did you not? If something were to happen, like today, they\u2019ll inform you.\u201d Jen lowered his voice, trying to calm the situation. \u201cNow please, focus on the approval of those documents.\u201dJust as things seemed to be settling, and the angry flush was receding from the duke\u2019s cheeks, came the news that Dajal was teaching her himself. It was all Jen could do to stop Alexcent from storming straight past him out the room.He flung himself forward and grabbed Alexcent\u2019s pants. \u201cPlease! Your Excellency!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77\u201cLet go!\u201d Alexcent roared.\u201cJust\u2014\u201d Jen knew a losing battle when he saw one. \u201cKeep your composure. Now is not the time. Only when she calls for help\u2026 Then\u2026 Then I won\u2019t try and stop you.\u201d\u201cYou know exactly what kind of sick bastard Dajal is!\u201dWithout thinking, Jen blurted out. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who has been overlooking him this entire time!\u201d And with that Officer Jen hit the nail on the head.Alexcent froze. \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Suddenly a cloud of frost rained on his rage. \u201cIs that the same as this?\u201d\u201cI know you want to give her strength, but\u2026 don\u2019t you want to see her reign before that?\u201dAlexcent stiffened but said nothing. His eyes were fixed on the door, the letter in his hand crumpled to beyond recognition.\u201cPlease, just wait a little bit longer. I\u2019m sure she will think of something.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how aristocratic women work,\u201d Alexcent said slowly. \u201cSince they\u2019re raised in nobility and comfort, they are oblivious to how the world works.\u201d\u201cYour Excellency, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re worried about,\u201d said Jen, \u201cbut please trust me and leave it to her. In the meantime, you can\u2019t let Lady Amethyst\u2019s efforts go to waste.\u201dAlexcent sighed loudly, trying to calm his raging mind. \u201cI dislike you,\u201d he said, looking down at Jen, \u201cas much as I do Lunia.\u201dJen felt some of the tension leave his body. \u201cI can understand me, but why Lunia?\u201dAlexcent carried on as though he hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that you know so much and say nothing. I hardly had to blink and here you are, sounding like Lunia.\u201d He scoffed. \u201cYou make me sick.\u201d\u201cThat is correct, but Lunia is not serving you right now, she is serving Lady Amethyst.\u201d Jen helpfully reminded.\u201cI know!\u201d Alexcent snapped.\u201cThat means her master is Lady Amethyst, not you, Sir. It is only natural that she is Lunia\u2019s number one priority. You know what Lunia is like.\u201d\u201cWhich is why she is disgraceful and repulsive, much like yourself.\u201d The duke hissed. He was disgruntled of Jen\u2019s indifference towards his wife\u2019s dangerous stunt. Right now, he was filled with anger, Jen knew he was saying things he didn\u2019t exactly mean.Jen reined in his urge to retort, agreeing was easier at this moment. \u201cI am aware, Sir. That is why I need your approval of those documents.\u201dLater, having barely calmed his liege, Jen exited the office, a bunch of papers in hand. The altercation with the duke had left him with thoughts that demanded answers. If that is the case, what is Lady Amethyst thinking? I wonder if it\u2019s right that you are stopped\u2026He shook his head slowly, giving way to the whims in his mind. Dajal, of all people\u2026 I thought it would be okay because I didn\u2019t notice his appearance\u2026 He just couldn\u2019t get rid of the nervous thoughts that cluttered his head.Once he\u2019d returned to his own office, he opened his desk drawer and took out a different document. It was Aran Bank\u2019s customer management list. As he stared down at it, more thoughts and questions bombarded him.Should he tell Lady Amethyst? Or take advantage of Lunia\u2026?I\u2019d surely hear no end to Alexcent\u2019s nagging, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m nervous\u2026Jen shook his head violently. Is the duke contagious? How is it that he too was worried about Lady Amethyst?Okay, he reasoned with himself, It\u2019s not that I\u2019m nervous. I just need a little bit of help\u2026This was because, the day something really did happen, the first head to roll wouldn\u2019t be Dajal\u2019s but his.Jen\u2019s body tensed. As much as he tried to convince himself he wasn\u2019t nervous, he was near certain it would be the death of him. He frowned and picked up the document. Before he could get the data he needed from the bank, the thing that he\u2019d been worried about, happened.Jen recalled the time and brought his hand up and fiddled idly with his neck. Relief that his neck was still intact washed over him. He was more concerned about Amethyst, even though she was only in a contractual marriage.\u203bThe mansion was busy all morning. Carriages rolled in one after another, and even though the banquet hall was already full, there was a line of carriages full of people still waiting to enter.Rather than shopping, Amethyst\u2019s goal had been to learn the currency value of the Kingodm of Sehar. If she were to live alone later, she had to somehow know the value of the money. And, she discovered that the best way to do that was buying things. She\u2019d compare her purchases to the value of things where she lived and work out the value of the \u2018ar\u2019, the monetary unit here.\u201cOne ar equals\u2026 one dollar?\u201d she whispered to herself.The price of a single apple hovered somewhere around two ars, however, it was said that five apples usually cost around ten dollars. She had to master probability calculations. If she made even the slightest mistake, she\u2019d lose money or get totally ripped off. While Amethyst ran calculations through her head, Lunia, along with several maids, started looking through the dresses.\u201cHow much is this one?\u201d\u201cEight thousand ars so\u2026 about eight-thousand dollars? For one dress! This is madness! Who the hell would buy this!\u201dHaving not seen each other for a long while, Lunia and the maids were making the best of their time together by chatting excitedly amongst themselves. They paid no attention to Amethyst\u2019s expression of disbelief and awe.\u201cMadam.\u201d Came the voice of one of the maids. \u201cHow about this dress? The soft cream and dark green ribbon will go wonderfully with your complexion, Lady Amethyst. You usually like light clothes.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s what I thought! I think it will go well with the colour of your eyes, Lady Amethyst.\u201d Chipped in a second maid.After seeing the prices, Lady Amethyst hurriedly shook her head. \u201cNo, no\u2026 it\u2019s okay.\u201d However, her eyes lingered on the garment before she tore her gaze away.\u201cThen how about this one? You\u2019ll look stunning in this seductive red, Madam.\u201d Offered a third maid.\u201cThe colour just about matches Master\u2019s eyes,\u201d said another, \u201cIf the two of you stand side by side in this dress, it would be perfect.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Amethyst scanned the dress, tempted by their comments.It was the most beautiful dress she\u2019d seen the entire day. Feathers ran along the chest line, embellished jewels glittering at the waistband. The wide, pleated skirt was reminiscent of a rose. Just as she was considering it, her eye caught sight of the price. Her awe quickly morphed into panic.This one had one more \u20180\u2019 on it than the last dress!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Huh, what the hell!! Is this a joke? Might as well buy a vehicle with that money.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d she blurted out, never one to hide her heart.\u201cWhat?! Madam, the dresses you possess in your closet are\u2026 No, way more than that one.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d She fired back with one word of surprise at Lunia\u2019s comment.\u201cCompared to one I bought a few days ago, this is rather cheap.\u201d\u201cOh, was it that expensive?\u201dDid they really know? That the dress was that expensive? How could they just buy without thinking twice? Wait, were they going to buy everything here? Seriously\u2026!?Amethyst, who hadn\u2019t known it\u2019d be this expensive, became flustered. Her heart was incessantly throbbing through her chest and she ended up not buying the dress.Lunia was upset with her mistress\u2019s strangely thrifty behaviour. She said, \u201cMadam, with all of the merchants at the mansion, if you don\u2019t purchase anything now\u2026 a bad rumor could probably spread.\u201d\u201cBad rumor?\u201d Amethyst quirked her eyebrow.\u201cCorrect. The duke\u2019s influence has declined, and it\u2019s not like what it used to be\u2026 There will be all sorts of stories floating around. And if those get around to the duke, he will be furious.\u201d Lunia explained.\u201cUmmm, yeah but\u2026 this is overkill. A dress that costs 90,000 ars\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the price, just choose one. Isn\u2019t what you like most important, Lady Amethyst?\u201dAmethyst couldn\u2019t easily abandon the habits she had formed through the years in her previous life. So she was unaware all of the time.My choice\u2026!All right, whatever I want. I\u2019m supposed to do whatever, as much as I like!It\u2019s not even my money anyway!As Alexcent\u2019s indifferent countenance floated through her mind, her chest flared up. The man had so much money, this will be just a tear in a bucket for him.No, not this. Let this be one big \u2018F*CK YOU\u2019!\u201cGood! I\u2019ll take that red dress.\u201d She declared resolutely.\u201cAll right, what a splendid choice.\u201d Lunia was relieved now.\u201cAnd that dress, this one, the light blue one, all of them!!\u201dA pleased smile spread across Lunia\u2019s face as she nodded. The merchant also bowed her head in delight.Amethyst found it difficult at first, but the next time she was sure it would be a cakewalk. Thanks to Lunia\u2019s assistance, she was able to grasp the nuances of it all. She went on to choose and buy with nary a care\u2026 accessories, hats, gloves, etc., whatever she liked.She was thrilled to have a shopping cart full of things she wanted on such a stressful day. Although she never made the payment herself, it still made her feel better.Amethyst had only just utilized her shopping skills\u2026 She couldn\u2019t believe she bought anything she wanted without having to worry about money. The exhilarating pleasure evoked a breathtaking relief. It seemed true that the rich really didn\u2019t look at price tags when they shopped.\u201cThese gloves go with this dress. How about them?\u201d\u201cHmmm, I think the gloves with the white lace look better than those. Wait, just give me everything!\u201d\u201cYes Madam. Then we\u2019ll buy all the gloves here.\u201d\u201cAll right. Splendid!\u201dNext up were shoes.In fact, Amethyst had loved dress shoes since even before her marriage. Since she was rather petite, she always wore at least a seven-inch heel; high heels were like pride. She changed them out for low heels and sneakers when she had a baby. Sandals in the summer were a luxury. And sandals she could easily slip on and off were the best.Not long after her gaze fell on the shoe section, her eyes began to shine and twinkle. She picked the shoes directly in front of her- a pink pair of open-toe shoes with a ribbon tied above the heel\u2026 bright red Mary Jane-style shoes with straps around the back\u2026 suede\u2026 dark rose brown slip-on with an ankle strap\u2026 And how could she miss the wedge shoes with natural beige-toned natural soles\u2026 D\u2019Orsay shoes with a low-cut front that showed part of a woman\u2019s toes looked the best in black. Every woman needed at least one pair!\u201cI\u2019ll take these!\u201dAnd then there was the long, leather boots she\u2019d yearned for so long\u2026Different from the \u2018old her\u2019, Amethyst was ecstatic to be able to buy whatever without having to worry.What in the world! I didn\u2019t expect there would be a day I can wear these long boots! I can\u2019t believe it!Really\u2026 \u00a0My legs will be killers in these!!!For someone who used to have thunder thighs, Amethyst now drooled over her own legs.\u201cLunia, I want every color and length of boots in this style.\u201d\u201cYes Madam.\u201d\u201cAnd comfy shoes, just in case you didn\u2019t know. Especially loafers!\u201dLunia steadily wrote down the items Amethyst had chosen and handed them to the merchant.\u201cNow, I want to see something else\u2014\u201dEveryone knows- if you\u2019re going to spend money like no tomorrow, you had better look at jewelry!\u201cWhich should I choose?\u201d Amethyst queried.\u201cIt\u2019d be best to see a jeweler.\u201d Lunia suggested.\u201cRight. I\u2019ll ask the merchant to ready them soon. Should I order you some tea while you wait?\u201d Lunia said.\u201cYes, that\u2019d be good.\u201dAfter she had taken a few sips of the tea brought in by a maid, a jeweler entered. There was only one small box in the merchant\u2019s hands.\u201cWelcome, My Lady. I\u2019m Dunph, a jeweler from Diana Jewels. It\u2019s such an honor to meet you like this.\u201d The man courteously greeted.She set the teacup on the table and replied, \u201cYes, pleased to meet you. Mr. Dunph.\u201d\u201cPlease, just call me Dunph.\u201d He smiled.\u201cWill do. Thank you. By the way, this is much less than what I thought you\u2019d prepare. I called you because I want to purchase some jewelry, but\u2014\u201d She spoke as she eyed the box in his hand.\u201cOh, actually\u2026 I brought this because it\u2019s only to be shown to the wife of a duke.\u201d\u201cFor me? But I\u2019ve never made a purchase before.\u201d Amethyst was flabbergasted.\u201cYes, and that\u2026 This necklace is a present from Lord du Skad.\u201d Dunph proceeded to open the box he was holding.In no time, the necklace sitting neatly atop of the high-end fabric caught everyone\u2019s attention. A red jewel the size of a baby\u2019s fist adorned between two smaller jewels on either sides was soon presented before the lady. It hung upon an elaborately carved palladium rope, a very rare metal more precious than platinum- transparent and bold, shining brilliantly.At this rate\u2026 shouldn\u2019t it be registered as a national treasure? Such a necklace is mine!? From Alex?!\u201cIs\u2026 Is this really for me?\u201d Amethyst meekly asked.\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dThe jewelry simply replied while Amethyst stood there with a dumbfounded look on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79A few hours ago\u2026Many of the merchants gathered before the duke\u2019s mansion were chatting, waiting for their turn. Dunph was just watching silently, not being caught in the various conversations.\u201cI heard the new duchess called him in today,\u201d someone said.\u201cI see. He\u2019ll see a lot of money today since it\u2019s the great duke\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019d be great and all, but not too long ago he went to the earl\u2019s residence and came back empty-handed.\u201d Another remarked.\u201cHey, don\u2019t put a jinx on him. Since when is the earl and duke the same?\u201d\u201cHaha, if you say so.\u201d\u201cJust wait and see. The maids passing by said they\u2019ll be buying a lot.\u201d\u201cThen should we get our hopes up today?\u201dThey were all owners of high-end shops but were only merchants. However, Dunph was simply waiting to see, not expecting much.All these merchants dealt in items that wives of aristocrats could purchase, but each was different.Who buys precious metals like they\u2019re shopping at a grocery store?It was Diana Jewels that dealt only with the most precious jewels in the kingdom. Thanks to that, many were used to leaving empty-handed.If it\u2019s a new duchess, you know it\u2019s going to be clich\u00e9\u2026 At best, maybe some earrings? Today will just end up being a fruitless attempt. So we can leave soon. It\u2019s boring to just wait around.Right then, someone found and interrupted Dunph\u2019s musings.\u203b\u201cWhy is it so chaotic?\u201dAlexcent was in the office taking care of business. He was sorting through documents and trying to remain focused, but the ruckus from outside was getting on his nerves.As he poured a cup of tea, Pon said, \u201cLady Amethyst called the shop merchants today.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201d Alexcent was visibly surrpised.\u201cYes Sir.\u201d\u201cHmmmm\u2014\u201dBut why? I can see the numbers clearly. Then she has to live up to it.Alexcent, who was thinking hard about something, asked with a smirk, \u201cAnd is a jeweler here?\u201d\u201cYes Sir. All the prestigious merchants of the kingdom, including Aarst, have been brought together.\u201d\u201cThen bring them in. Only the prestigious ones.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dA little while later, Butler Pon returned to the office with Dunph by his side.\u201cPleased to meet you, Your Excellency. I am Dunph, from Diana Jewels.\u201d The man greeted politely.\u201cDiana Jewels?\u201d\u201cYes Sir.\u201dAlexcent moved over to the meeting table and told him, \u201cCome have a seat.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u201cSo, do you have anything to present to me?\u201d\u201cBeg your pardon, Sir?\u201d Dunph was puzzled.\u201cYou said you\u2019re a jeweler. As a merchant, didn\u2019t you come here to sell stuff?\u201d Alexcent flatly said.\u201cThat is correct, Sir\u2026 I thought I\u2019d be meeting Lady Amethyst.\u201d\u201cObviously you\u2019ll be seeing her too, but you know who it\u2019s better to deal with.\u201d\u201cI see. Please wait a moment.\u201dDunph hurried his staff to display the items on the table he brought today.What a tyranny! I thought I\u2019d be seeing the duchess today, I didn\u2019t expect Duke du Skad! There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be leaving empty-handed today.However, no matter how aristocratic one may be, the head of the family never bought jewelry for his wife. Dunph had meticulously chosen only the items worth selling today- high-ranking, though not top-class.Alexcent studied the jewels on display, then said with great courage, \u201cDammit, this is disappointing. I can\u2019t believe this is all.\u201d\u201cBeg your pardon?!\u201dThe duke\u2019s reaction was beyond Dunph\u2019s imagination.\u201cI had quite the expectation because you are a prestigious merchant, but now I\u2019m quite disappointed. I am done here. You can go.\u201d\u201cHold on\u2026! Wait, please. I was unaware, my lord, that you\u2019d be here. My apologies.\u201d Dunph scurried to present a top-class jewel, all the while carefully reading the environment.\u201cNow we\u2019re talking!\u201d Alexcent said, feeling relieved.Dunph then steadily showed him more jewels. \u201cHow about these? They are the best items we have in our jewelry store. If there\u2019s something that meets your desire, please let me know.\u201dThe duke, after carefully looking through then, tossed out carelessly, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m ecstatic at your\u2026 collection. This is it?\u201d\u201cThese are all of our top-class items, Sir. It will be hard to find these kinds of jewels anywhere else in all of the kingdom.\u201dWhat the\u2026 Why are you being so picky and curious when you don\u2019t want to buy anything!? It won\u2019t be easy to buy these kinds of high-quality jewels anywhere else. Dunph was reminded by Alexcent\u2019s incessant comments that yes, this was a fruitless attempt.\u201cTo say these are top-class, they certainly are, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re real. Do you think I like playing games?\u201d\u201cPardon? How dare you say such a thing?\u201d Dunph took a short breather, then continued. \u201cCan you wait just a little longer?\u201dHe left the office for a while, seeking for the duke\u2019s cooperation. And when he returned, he was carrying a small safe.Perhaps Alexcent had been bored while waiting, he was toying around with the other jewels on the table that he had left unattended.\u201cDuke du Skad!\u201d Frightened, Dunph hurriedly collected the jewels rolling around on the table and neatly placed them in the box.Alexcent only shrugged his shoulders comically.\u201cThis has been passed down from generation to generation. The best of the\u2026 No, this jewel cannot be graded, so it\u2019s been rejected every year at the auction\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d\u201cRight. And\u2014\u201dHe opened the safe and pulled out a small box from inside. After carefully opening it, the gem, known as the Goddess\u2019s Eye, a fiery red color beyond any imagination, flaunted its masterful and brilliance.\u201cGood\u2026 good.

    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Alexcent did not hesitate in buying the necklace that held the jewel \u2018Eye of the Goddess\u2019. Dunph was surprised, shocked even, because Alexcent hadn\u2019t even asked for the price before he decided to buy it.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d asked Alexcent, noticing the dumbfounded expression of Dunph.\u201cNo, sire,\u201d he stammered, \u201cNothing at all.\u201d\u201cBring this in, when you come,\u201d said Alexcent indicating the necklace.\u201cUnderstood, sire,\u201d he said.Dunph had never, in his wildest dreams, thought that the Eye of the Goddess would be sold. He had thought it impossible because none had the wealth enough to buy it.\u201cLeave now,\u201d said Alexcent, dismissing the shopkeeper.\u201cYes, sire,\u201d he said bowing, \u201cIt has been a pleasure to serve you. Thank you for honoring our shop.\u201d\u201cWrap all the best things in your shop and bring it to wherever Pon will guide you,\u201d instructed Alexcent as Dunph was leaving.\u201cAll\u2026 all of them?\u201d asked Dunph, stunned.\u201cIs there a problem with it?\u201d asked Alexcent.\u201cNo problem at all, sire!\u201d said Dunph hurriedly, \u201cI will do as commanded.\u201dDunph was led by Pon to a reception room, while servants placed the jewel boxes on the table in the middle. He felt extremely blissful at having sold all his best and most precious jewels in a day!*\u201cIs this for me?\u201d asked Amethyst, holding the beautiful necklace in her hands like something delicate and fraglile.\u201cOf course, my lady\u201d said Dunph, \u201cThis particular jewel called the \u2018Eye of the Goddess\u2019 hadn\u2019t found its owner yet. I am honored to have met you today.\u201d Amethyst thought the name was most apt. The red jewel reminded her of Alexcent\u2019s eyes.\u201cI have had the rest placed in your reception room,\u201d he said.\u201cThe rest?!\u201d asked Amethyst incredulously. She had wanted to shop for only a small accessory.\u201cThe good sir bought all of my best jewels,\u201d he said.\u201cAll of them?\u201d asked Amethyst, stunned.Dunph nodded. Amethyst wondered how much it had cost Alexcent.\u201cIt is my honor to have met you today,\u201d said Dunph, bowing, \u201cI will leave you with your jewels.\u201d Dunph said and left her gazing at the necklace.\u201cDo you want to try it on, my lady?\u201d asked Lunia.\u201cLater,\u201d she said and placed the necklace in the box. \u201cI want to finish shopping first.\u201dAmethyst thought all of it was too much. She had been hoping for a small, nice accessory not the jewels of the earth that she couldn\u2019t carry. She needed a change of venue.\u201cWhere do you want to go next?\u201d asked Lunia.\u201cThe weapon shop,\u201d said Amethyst.\u201cWhy the weapon shop, my lady?\u201d asked Lunia, surprised.\u201cI thought I could learn how to protect myself after what happened with Dajal,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cAnd for that I need to learn to fight. I need a weapon to do so. I have already asked Pon to show me one.\u201dAmethyst could not tell Lunia the whole truth. She wouldn\u2019t be Alexcent\u2019s wife after a year and would have no knights stationed to guard and protect her. She would have to do so herself. \u201cOh, I will call the merchant, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Lunia.He entered at Lunia\u2019s call. \u201cThank you for having me, Ma\u2019am,\u201d said the man, \u201cI am Jerome, from Zest Weapon Shop.\u201d The man looked more like a knight than merchant. Even with the monocle on his eyes, he looked like he belonged in a fight than a shop. \u201cHow may I be of help?\u201d\u201cI want to buy a sword that I can wield and a gun that I can possess,\u201d said Amethyst. Jerome looked surprised.\u201cIs there a problem Jerome?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cJust a little rare. I have only ever sold weapons to women who mostly want to buy them as gifts for their husbands. Forgive me for saying so.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI need to have them so that I can defend myself.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have suitable weapons right now at my disposal made for your build,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cWould it be alright if you checked the items that you want so that I can have it customized for you?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you provided that.\u201d\u201cThere are, even if rare, some ladies who approach my shop to buy a weapon for themselves,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cI have them customized to suit their build.\u201d\u201cThat is indeed great,\u201d said Amethyst.\u201cI will show you the swords first,\u201d said Jerome and led her to the display. Lunia followed her a step behind.\u201cPerhaps, this\u2026,\u201d said Jerome, as he lifted out a sword and handed it to her.Amethyst lifted the sword. It was a bit longer than she had expected and a bit heavy but she could lift it well.\u201cHow is it?\u201d asked Jerome.\u201cIt is a bit heavy, but alright,\u201d she said.\u201cI thought it might work,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cThis sword is used by the beginners in fighting.\u201d\u201cI think I can swing it,\u201d said Amethyst, excitedly. But Jerome stalled her hand.\u201cBe careful, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cYou might hurt your wrist the first time.\u201d\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said Amethyst.\u201cI think we may have to reduce the weight a little to make it lighter to wield,\u201d he said.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that make it less effective for a fight?\u201d she asked.\u201cSword fighting is more about agility and skill than the weight of it, Ma\u2019am,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cBut if you feel hesitant, it won\u2019t pose a problem if it is imbued with magic.\u201d\u201cThat can be done?\u201d she asked, curious.\u201cOf course,\u201d said Jerome, \u201cWe use powdered magic stones and mix it with the steel.\u201d\u201cThat is fascinating!\u201d said Amethyst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81\u201cDo you have a particular design you prefer?\u201d asked Jerome.\u201cAnything will do,\u201d said Amethyst, waving her hand. \u201cI just want something simple but effective to fulfil its function.\u201d\u201cHow about your family crest, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be showy and extravagant than necessary.\u201d\u201cAs you wish,\u201d said Jerome, reluctantly.Amethyst knew that usually the sword held the family crest on the steel or the pommel but she also knew that she wouldn\u2019t be a member of the Skad family for long. It was no use having the Skad crest on her sword.Jerome showed her some of the guns that he kept in boxes. Every single one was elaborately carved and looked very pompous. She found one which was smaller than the others and looked old. She picked it up, prepared her stance, closed an eye and tried to aim.\u201cI will take this one,\u201d she said, \u201cIt looks like it would be easier to carry.\u201d\u201cDo you know how to use it?\u201d asked Jerome.\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, \u201cBut I will learn.\u201dEmeis\u2019 shopping ended with Jerome\u2019s departure. She found the boxes of jewels that Dunph had mentioned when she returned to her room. She sighed. She opened them one by one to see exorbitant accessories in all designs, ranging from hairpins, to bracelets to glittering earrings.\u201cDo you not like them?\u201d asked Lunia hesitantly.\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d said Amethyst.\u201cThen why do you look so down, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that he would want to shower you with gifts,\u201d said Lunia, trying to make her feel better. Amethyst forced herself to smile.\u201cDid you enjoy shopping?\u201d came a man\u2019s voice from the door. He was here.\u201cYes,\u201d said Amethyst, turning around.Alexcent walked towards her. \u201cThey why do you look so downcast?\u201d he asked.\u201cNothing like that,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201cThank you for the gifts.\u201d\u201cDo you like them?\u201d he asked, looking at her.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d asked Alexcent, eyebrows raised.\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d she said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel that way,\u201d he said softly.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and forced a smile. It didn\u2019t matter, he wouldn\u2019t understand.Amethyst felt bitter about it. She felt a burden in her heart. She wondered if all these expensive gifts, that she didn\u2019t ask for, made her uncomfortable or was it because of Aran Bank? While Alexcent owned Aran Bank which dealt with black money, she was here lavishing on the jewels it bought her. It left a bitter taste in her mouth.\u201cThese gifts cost money,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd Aran Bank\u2014\u201d\u201cI know Aran Bank is shady, but I don\u2019t own all of it,\u201d said Alexcent cutting her off, \u201cI am only the manager, so to speak. I do not make much profit from it.\u201dIt would make her feel lighter if only that were true, but she knew better. It still made her feel uncomfortable and unconvinced. Nothing good could come out of black money, only danger.\u201cDo you want the bank gone?\u201d he asked, looking at her forlorn expression.\u201cYou can do that?\u201d she asked, stunned.\u201cIf you want,\u201d he said.Amethyst felt a little relieved at his words, realizing that he had no love for black money. But it also made her feel a little guilty that he would go to such extent to please her. She knew she could not ask him to do that.\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright,\u201d she said, tiredly, \u201cI just wish you weren\u2019t involved in these shady dealings. I don\u2019t want you to be in danger.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be in any danger,\u201d he said, gently, \u201cBut if it is bothering you so much, I can turn Aran Bank into a normal bank, without any \u2018shady dealings\u2019.\u201d Amethyst felt her heart flutter. She didn\u2019t know if she could ask him to do that. And if she did, what would it entail? She just looked at him fondly.\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, taking her hand and pulling her over to stand in front of the mirror, \u201cYou haven\u2019t worn the necklace I bought you.\u201dAlexcent picked the necklace from the box and stood behind her. He swept her hair to the front to expose her neckline. There was still a faint bruise that hadn\u2019t completely healed and he furrowed his brows at the sight. He lowered the necklace on her neck and closed the clasp. She felt the cold weight of the metal on her collarbone. He placed his hand on her shoulders.\u201cIt suits you,\u201d he whispered in her ear.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, \u201cThe jewel reminds me of your eyes.\u201d She turned away from the mirror towards him. His red eyes gazed so tenderly down at her that color filled her world and made her heart flutter. Alexcent lowered his head and kissed her on the neck. His lips were hot, as though branding her neck with his mark.*Alexcent was in a meeting with his subordinates discussing on next year\u2019s budget when Pon came rushing into the room.\u201cMaster,\u201d he said, hurriedly, \u201cYou have to come with me to the training field now!\u201d\u201cPon, you can see that I am having a meeting,\u201d said Alexcent sternly.\u201cIt\u2019s Madam\u2026,\u201d said Pon, breathless from running.Alexcent\u2019s eyes flashed at his words. He stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s end the meeting here for today,\u201d he said.He rushed out with Pon to the training field. When they reached, they saw knights facing Amethyst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Amethyst was so determined that she had went to the knights\u2019 training field. She had promised herself that she wanted to learn to wield a sword, and she would do it. She needed to learn to defend herself after what had happened in the past. She found Hill a little further away from the knights who were training. He was taking a break.\u201cSir Hill,\u201d she said happily, \u201cHow have you been? I have been looking for you all over.\u201d\u201cMadam,\u201d acknowledged Hill. \u201cI am very well, thank you. How may I be of help?\u201d\u201cI want to learn to wield a sword,\u201d she said eagerly, \u201cI was hoping you could teach me.\u201dHill looked at her, shocked. \u201cWhat?!\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cI mean, I thought I should learn to defend myself,\u201d she continued, \u201cSeeing what happened that time. And who would be best suited for the job than you?\u201d She added hesitantly, with a mock smile.\u201cWasn\u2019t that what you brought upon yourself?\u201d asked Hill. She was surprised at the retort. Hill was always so polite. But it was true, if she had thought things through and not rushed like she did, things would have ended differently.\u201cAll the more reason to learn then,\u201d said Amethyst enthusiastically. \u201cI should learn to protect myself in any case.\u201dHill\u2019s stare was intense and she tried not to flinch. \u201cYou only need to do one thing for protection, my lady,\u201d he said firmly, \u201cRepeat after me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused.\u201c\u2019Save me\u2019, that\u2019s all you have to say,\u201d said Hill.\u201cSave me?\u201d she asked, confused more than before. Was he mocking her?The knights who had saved Amethyst before now circled her. Some of them who had been training appeared near her, hands on their swords. Others just stared at what was happening. Amethyst was wide-eyed.\u201cDo you see?\u201d asked Hill, \u201cYou just need to utter those words. These knights will always be near you, out of sight.\u201d\u201cBut what if I can\u2019t speak?\u201d she argued.Hill extended a hand lightning fast and grabbed her wrist. The space was cacophonous with the sound of sword being drawn from their sheath. The knights in grey glared at Hill, their sword inches from his chest. Hill let go of her hand and took a step back.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, my lady,\u201d said Hill, \u201cThey would have run me through, had they not known me. If I meant any harm to you, my head would be rolling on the floor and I would be dead. The Master has already taken all precautions for your safety.\u201dAmethyst really wanted to learn. Perhaps she had this protection now, since she was a Duchess. But she needed to learn in order to protect herself when she was no longer here. Besides, it would always be a handy skill and would give her a sense of comfort when faced with danger.\u201cThen will you teach me if I order you?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cMadam,\u201d said Hill, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cYou are a lady,\u201d he said, \u201cA small wound on you would mean death for us. These men would kill anyone who so much as brushed against you.\u201d\u201cI will tell them not to,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cPlease.\u201dHill looked like he was cornered, not knowing what to respond. He helplessly glanced at the Commander of the First Division, Buer, who was a few steps away to hear their conversation.Buer stepped forward. \u201cMadam, we do not have a sword suited for your build,\u201d he said, \u201cUsing a sword that is unsuitable could harm your wrist.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct!\u201d said Hill, relieved.\u201cI had one made especially for me,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cIt will be delivered soon. Will you teach me then?\u201dBuer tried to dissuade her with other reasons, but she would hear none of it. Hill looked defeated.Alexcent walked towards them, understanding the situation. The knights were reluctant to teach her sword fighting, understandably so, since she was a woman of power only second to the Emperor. If she got hurt, it would mean their deaths.\u201cAmethyst,\u201d he called.Amethyst turned around. She beamed at him like he was the best thing she could have asked for at that moment. \u201cAlec!\u201d she said happily, \u201cYou came at the perfect time. Can\u2019t you encourage them to teach me how to use a sword? Please! You told me there was nothing I couldn\u2019t do here.\u201dAlexcent remembered the night she had asked what she could even do in a place like this. He had told her that there was nothing she couldn\u2019t do here, before she had fallen asleep. She meant this? Alexcent thought she would never stop surprising him. He was amused. The knights, though, looked at him pleadingly.\u201cI will teach you,\u201d he said.\u201cYou?\u201d she narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou are always busy with your work. Why can\u2019t you ask any of them to teach me?\u201d The knights shook their heads at Alexcent when she wasn\u2019t looking.\u201cIt alright,\u201d he assured her, \u201cI can spare a few hours to teach you to use a sword.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Her suspicion was gone, only to be replaced by a rapturous smile that seemed like the sun shining through the clouds. Alexcent\u2019s heart thumped.\u201cIt\u2019s a promise,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cBut only if you wake up early in the morning.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she said incredulously, \u201cThat means you will never teach me.\u201d\u201cJust don\u2019t stay too late at night,\u201d he said laughing, \u201cYou will be alright.\u201d\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d said Amethyst, blushing. She turned to the knights. \u201cThank you, that will be all.\u201dAmethyst walked with him away from the training area. She thought she heard the knights\u2019 relieved sighs as she walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Alexcent tried to wake Amethyst at dawn the next morning. \u201cAmethyst,\u201d he said softly.\u201cMm,\u201d she mumbled.\u201cWake up,\u201d he said and nibbled at her lips, lightly.\u201cNo,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cA little bit more of sleep.\u201dShe snuggled into his arms and murmured something and fell asleep. Alexcent rose out of bed and stretched. He looked at her sleeping figure curled on the bed. It made him want to spend the day with her in bed. He shook his head and got dressed. He was going to walk out of the bedroom when he heard her voice.\u201cYou should have woken me,\u201d she said, as she yawned and got out of bed. Alexcent smirked.*Amethyst stood in the training area with Alexcent. He held a sword in his strong arms, his muscles taut. The sword was long and beautiful. She felt her nerves tingle. It was her first time seeing him with a sword. His eyes looked cold. He approached her and stood behind her.\u201cLet\u2019s teach you to hold it first,\u201d he said as he handed her the sword. \u201cLift it.\u201d\u201cIt seems so heavy,\u201d she said as she tried to lift it with all her might.\u201cIt will be alright,\u201d he said.It wasn\u2019t alright. The sword was made for someone larger and burlier than her. She tried to lift it above her head and trembled with the weight. Her hands shook before the blade dropped to the ground.\u201cCan you swing it?\u201d he asked. \u201cTry.\u201d\u201cYou have never taught anyone else before, have you?\u201d she asked, looking at him.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cBecause you are asking me to swing a sword that I can barely lift,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201cWhy are you trying to learn sword fighting when you can barely lift one?\u201d He smirked.\u201cWhose sword is this?\u201d she asked.\u201cMine, of course,\u201d he said.\u201cYour sword?\u201d she said, \u201cSo how in hell am I supposed to swing it? Have you seen yourself? You are thrice as large as me!\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t a good student if you insult your teacher so much,\u201d he said, jokingly.\u201cThat\u2019s because you are a bad teacher,\u201d she retorted.\u201cIt\u2019s child\u2019s play, Amethyst,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cIf you were in battle, you would already be dead without being able to lift a sword, much less swing it.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked, \u201cI will show you.\u201dAmethyst clenched her teeth and lifted the word to swing it. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said as he pretended to run.\u201cYou asked for it!\u201d she said, as she chased him. Eventually she got tired and stopped.\u201cIs that all you got?\u201d he asked, chuckling.\u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d she said, panting from all the running around.\u201cI won\u2019t, sorry,\u201d he said as he tried to hold his mirth.Amethyst tried to Lift the sword again to swing it. She lifted it up high and stumbled. It was just too heavy. She almost fell because of its weight and Alexcent rushed over to her.Alexcent grabbed Amethyst\u2019s sword with one hand and her wrist with the other, \u201cI said it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to swing,\u201d Amethyst shot back, \u201cI\u2019m just being a model student.\u201d\u201cYou always try to win,\u201d he said sternly, staring down at her.She stuck her tongue out. Alexcent couldn\u2019t help but smile, his heart beating a little faster. Before he had time to think, his body reacted\u2014he bent down to kiss her. The hand that had been holding the sword moved up to grab her chin, and the one that had been on her wrist snaked up to her neck to deepen the kiss.Amethyst went rigid in surprise, but her heart fluttered.His tongue ravished her mouth and lips thoroughly, only making her want more. The smell of her perfume hung heavy in the air. He didn\u2019t know why she wanted to learn how to use a sword, but he had no desire to stop her. He wanted her to give up on her own and so had given her his own sword that, in the past, he had kept only for himself. Amethyst had been adorable from the start of the training to the finish. Alexcent had kissed her to suppress his emotions.Hill, Buer and Leyrian stopped in their tracks when they saw the two lovers sharing a kiss.\u201cWhen did the training area become so flamboyant?\u201d Leyrian said to the others.\u201cI guess since now.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026 Is that our Master\u2019s sword?\u201d\u201cI think it is.\u201d\u201cThat sword holds a soul stone\u2026\u201d Buer couldn\u2019t finish his sentence.And Amethyst had no wish to stop her training.*\u201cThis is the budget proposal for our annual festival and the upcoming hunting competition,\u201d Alexcent said, \u201cThe budget for the former is the same as last year.\u201d\u201cSir, since you have just been married, might I suggest this year be a bit more festive?\u201cDo as you like,\u201d Alexcent said half-heartedly.\u201cIn that case, I will add an increase of 15% and add it to our supplementary budget. The hunting competition is that held by the royal family a few months later.\u201d\u201cSince our mistress will participate, we have allocated more funds to it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Alexcent said, \u201cShe won\u2019t participate.\u201d\u201cSir, this is the first event our mistress will participate in after becoming Duchess. Her Majesty will not let this slide.\u201d\u201cRemove it,\u201d Alexcent said firmly. He\u2019d been half listening to the proceedings of the budget meeting. It was only when Pone came rushing in that his attention piqued.Before Alexcent could ask why he was here, Pone blurted out, \u201cMadame has fallen from a horse!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Alexcent immediately abandoned the meeting and rushed to the riding field. He was met with the sight of a still excited horse and Amethyst sitting on the ground. Stable hands and maids milled around nervously. The stable hands could not touch Amethyst, while the maids could not carry her.\u201cAmethyst,\u201d Alexcent said in response to her questioning look, \u201cwhat are you doing!\u201d\u201cAh Alec, you came?\u201d Amethyst said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I merely plopped to the ground after a miscommunication with the horse, seeing as I am still a novice. I\u2019m alright, everyone is just too worried.\u201dAlexcent didn\u2019t listen to her excuses. He lifted her up to carry her off the field. As he walked, he shouted over his shoulder at the stable hands, \u201cGet rid of that horse!\u201d\u201cAlec, it\u2019s my fault!\u201d Amethyst protested, \u201cDon\u2019t blame the horse.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re hurt!\u201d Alexcent said angrily.Amethyst flinched at Alexcent\u2019s tone. Usually, he always lost arguments to her, but now he was scaring her. His strange, furious tone made her feel suddenly alone in the world and her eyes teared up.Alexcent\u2019s grip on her tightened, hugging her closer, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you, but a horse throwing its rider cannot be tolerated.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Amethyst said tearfully, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say you will get rid of the horse.\u201d\u201cI will. I\u2019m going to call a doctor to see to you.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Amethyst said quietly.Alexcent carried Amethyst to the bedroom and ordered Pon to bring a doctor. He didn\u2019t enjoy seeing Amethyst hurt in any way.For a while after this incident, he thought things had quietened down. But that was before Pon came to him again. Alexcent had been in his office looking over some documents.\u201cMaster!\u201d Pon\u2019s voice brought him running to the door.\u201cWhat is this time?\u201d Alexcent demanded.\u201cMadame and her gun\u2026\u201dShock overtook Alexcent and he bolted from his office to the shooting range. People were standing around pale faced and waiting for him. The marble statues that had decorated the space were now in pieces.\u201cAmethyst,\u201d Alexcent said patiently, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI wanted to learn how to shoot,\u201d she answered innocently.Alexcent drew a patient breath, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to hunt.\u201d\u201cAmethyst, give me that gun,\u201d Alexcent held out his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201dAmethyst ignored him, \u201cAlec, why can\u2019t I shoot straight? Is my stature wrong? This is right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she took up her position again.Alexcent sighed in defeat and went to her. He grabbed her lower abdomen and pulled her against him, pressing them tightly together.Amethyst could feel his chest against her shoulder and his warm breath over her head. The feelings stilled her.Alexcent closed his left hand over Amethyst\u2019s and slowly raised the gun, \u201cYou have to tighten your shoulder since there\u2019s a strong recoil. Then aim at the center of the target.\u201dAmethyst narrowed her eyes as she stared at the target\u2019s center.\u201cMatch your breathing with mine,\u201d Alexcent instructed, \u201cSlowly.\u201dAmethyst listened to his breathing, pacing hers with his until it seemed they had become one. Time seemed to stop. Her heartbeat was loud in ears, signalling her to shoot. She pulled the trigger and shot the target dead-on with a loud bang.\u201cDid you see that!\u201d she said excitedly.\u201cI did indeed,\u201d Alexcent said, his chest pulling tight at the sight of Amethyst\u2019s smiling face.\u201cAlec, if I practice harder, can I participate in the hunting competition?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexcent said in surprise, \u201cNo,\u201d he refused flatly.\u201cWhy?\u201d she said with a pout, \u201cI heard women could enter, and Her Majesty is hosting the competition.\u201d\u201cHer Majesty hosts all competitions. I can\u2019t let you participate.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Amethyst pressed.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Alexcent countered.\u201cI will practice hard and make sure I don\u2019t hurt anyone. Can\u2019t you trust me?\u201d she seemed a little hurt at his refusal.\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Alexcent said softly, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201dAmethyst was stunned to silence. That hadn\u2019t been the response she\u2019d been expecting.*Amethyst\u2019s final responsibility of the day was to greet Alexcent. Recently, he\u2019d been coming home earlier than usual and every night they supped together.Alexcent found it charming how Amethyst always carefully avoided the vegetables on her plate.Alexcent picked up his glass of wine, sipped it, then lowered it from his lips, \u201cWhat will you try and learn tomorrow?\u201dAmethyst nudged a spoonful of vegetables around her plate without looking up, \u201cI have something in mind\u2026 But I know I will not be permitted.\u201dAlexcent remained silent. He thought it best not to ask any further questions, considering what had already happened regarding Amethyst\u2019s other learning endeavours.At his continued silence, Amethyst looked up, \u201cWon\u2019t you ask me what I want to learn?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Alexcent said flatly.\u201cAsk me.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s cheeks coloured, \u201cIf you do not ask me, we shall eat separately.\u201dHis shoulders sagged in defeat, \u201cWhat do you want to learn?\u201d he said unenthusiastically.\u201cMagic.\u201dAlexcent whipped his head up and stared at Amethyst. He made no attempt to hide his surprise at her words, \u201cMagic?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she replied defiantly.If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!Patreon is not compulsory.

    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Alexcent couldn\u2019t believe what Amethyst had just said, \u201cBut why?\u201d he asked incredulously.\u201cYou can do anything with magic,\u201d Amethyst said, \u201cOnce you learn magic, you don\u2019t have to learn how to use a sword. And in any case, I thought I was rather talented with magic.\u201d\u201cWas there any Goddess\u2019 blood in the Lohikin family\u2026\u201d despite the glaringly obvious answer, Alexcent pretended to think hard as he asked her a question.\u201cNo. That\u2019s why I was unable to learn magic. Pretty unfortunate, if you ask me.\u201d She answered forlornly.Alexcent shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m grateful for it, I\u2019ll even have to thank you for it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Amethyst asked stunned.\u201cIf you had any magical talent, there would be nothing left of the mansion.\u201d\u201cAlec!\u201d her voice pitched upwards.Alexcent pushed a plate of salad in front of Amethyst, \u201cStop chasing fantasises and finish eating.\u201dAmethyst ignored the salad as well as Alexcent\u2019s request, \u201cCome to think of it\u2026 Alex, are you a wizard?\u201d\u201cA wizard?\u201d he arched an eyebrow in surprise.She nodded, \u201cYou told me that someone is capable of performing magic when they have the blood of a goddess. You have the blood of a goddess and it\u2019s extraordinarily strong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a wizard, but I can do magic.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Amethyst leaned forward curiously, \u201cCan you show me a little?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Alexcent said bluntly and continued eating his dinner.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Amethyst couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be space-shifting or anything extreme. Just a little, just make this water cup disappear or any other small thing. I just want to see it with my own eyes, please?\u201d\u201cAsh, I can\u2019t do it because my magic is more for fighting, an attack-type, if you please.\u201d\u201cAn attack-type? Care to explain?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Alexcent said casually, \u201cthere\u2019s property in magic too.\u201dThe only thing Amethyst could think of when it came to properties of magic was along the lines of earth, fire, wind, water and the mind. Sort of like the five forces uniting into one power. \u201cProperties?\u201d she asked eventually.\u201cI\u2019m an attack-type,\u201d Alexcent repeated, \u201ctherefore, I can only use magic to attack others. What you want to see is magic only wizards who practice defensive, or subsistence magic can do.\u201dAmethyst fell silent for a short time as she digested what Alexcent had said. So, simple everyday magic was not performed by an attack-type wizard. To her, it seemed that those who did not have strong Goddess blood, like Alexcent, were more likely to be defensive or subsistence-type wizards.Finally, she said, \u201cI see\u2026 That\u2019s too bad. Then am I correct in assuming that the attack-type is the strongest type of wizard?\u201d\u201cAmong performing magic tricks?\u201d Alexcent raised an eyebrow.Amethyst ignored his comment, \u201cI\u2019m assuming the attack-type would be the strongest, since the name hints at offensiveness.\u201d\u201cNo, the strongest type would be the eroding-type. Then it would be the attack-type.\u201dNow her curiosity had been stirred, \u201cEroding-type? What is that?\u201d\u201cTo eat into a man\u2019s soul,\u201d Alexcent said plainly.Amethyst stared at him, \u201cSo when that happens\u2026 do they get full control of the body?\u201d The thought that she could be manipulated by others against her own will was frightening.\u201cThat,\u201d Alexcent confirmed with a nod, \u201cbut they also have the power to destroy the soul.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat I said. Quite literally to destroy one\u2019s soul. They don\u2019t have to fight and kill to do such a thing.\u201dAmethyst didn\u2019t know whether to feel horrified or curious, \u201cDoes that mean they can enter your body as well?\u201dHe nodded again, \u201cCorrect, which is why it\u2019s the most dangerous property. Fortunately, not everyone can do it.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me there\u2019s someone capable of such magic? Surely it\u2019s dangerous to have someone like that roaming freely?\u201d\u201cThere is someone. Just one.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s skin felt suddenly chilled at the news, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cEmpress Belice.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s mouth opened slightly, and her eyes widened in surprise. So, it was Empress Belice who had inherited the strongest blood of the Goddess. The greatest wizard alive.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Alexcent\u2019s voice broke through her thoughts, \u201cyou can\u2019t use the magic as easily as you think. It\u2019s been blocked by the Temple for a very long time. No emperor actually ever used the magic. It was strictly prohibited by the Temple even then and would not have been allowed.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Amethyst ventured, \u201cAt the Temple?\u201d\u201cYes, the Temple has also been served as a Watcher.\u201d\u201cBut why didn\u2019t any emperor ever use the magic of Erosion?\u201dAlexcent gave a light shrug, \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cMeaning?\u2019 Amethyst pressed.\u201cIt means Emperors were capable of using Attack magic without using any type of Erosion magic. Damn it!\u201d Alexcent spat. He\u2019d said too much.Amethyst didn\u2019t miss Alexcent\u2019s sudden change in attitude, but it didn\u2019t stop her from asking another question, \u201cSo, Empress Belice knows how to use an Attack spell?\u201dAlexcent hesitated before he said, \u201cNo.\u201dAmethyst\u2019s face scrunched in confusion. She mentally went over everything Alexcent had just told her. Emperors could use both the magic of Erosion and Attack. But then he\u2019d just said that Empress Belice was an emperor who didn\u2019t know how to use an attack-type magic. It made no sense. If Empress Belice was an erosion-type wizard and Alex was an attack-type wizard\u2026\u201cAlex?\u201d she tried again.\u201cI mean,\u201d he started, \u201cWhat I meant was\u2026 was that\u2026\u201d he struggled to string a sentence together and was obviously greatly trouble by his mistake.Amethyst quickly asked another question before he could recover, \u201cAre you saying that an Emperor can use both erosion and attack-type magic?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Alexcent replied haltingly.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Amethyst frowned, \u201cEmpress Belice can use erosion-type magic only, right?\u201dAlexcent grunted in response.\u201cWhich means Empress Belice had to originally have been born with both magic powers, but was only born with one,\u201d at Alexcent\u2019s silence, Amethyst continued, \u201cYou, her twin, who was born when she was\u2026. Was given the attack-type magic?\u201dInstead of answering, Alexcent only nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Amethyst gasped.In the Sehar Kingdom, it was tradition that the empress become emperor of the kingdom. The reasoning behind it was that the blood of the Goddess was stronger in women than it was in men.Goddess blood meant magic. Which was then separated into Erosion and Attack type.Even if the Temple blocked erosion-type magic that was capable of controlling one\u2019s soul, it was natural for the emperor to lead the kingdom with just the attack-type magic. But Alexcent and Belice, born twins, had each inherited one of the magic types\u2026\u201cNo wonder you were so vulnerable to her,\u201d it made sense to Amethyst now, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just because you two were brother and sister.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Alexcent said, \u201cI owe Belice my life.\u201d\u201cYou owe her your life?\u201dAlexcent\u2019s voice lost all expression. He spoke with a kind of indifference that was nearly cold, \u201cIt was the first time a set of twins had ever been born in this kingdom. Sometimes a son was born, but that was only after the daughter had been born. And not only that, it was also the first time the magic ability was shared.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Amethyst asked.\u201cSo, at that time, the Senate and the Temples considered it a bad omen.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d just when things were starting to make sense to her, she started to feel a little lost again.\u201cA prophecy predicting the doom of the Kingdom,\u201d Alexcent continued, \u201cThe Temple said my magical abilities had to be taken away.\u201d\u201cIs that even possible to do?\u201dAlexcent smirked at the question, \u201cIt was possible to take them away\u2026 By getting rid of me.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Amethyst couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing, \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I was destined to die as soon as I was born.\u201d\u201cAnd there was no other way to just\u2026 take away your ability?\u201dAlexcent shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to separate magic from a soul whose only ability was to eat, cry and sleep.\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2026?\u201d Amethyst wanted to know more, he was alive right before her eyes right now.\u201cThe Temple prepared the ceremony and that day, Belice cried a lot.\u201d\u201cCried?\u201d Amethyst tiled her head.\u201cYes. When the priest held the sword against me, Belice wept bitterly. As you know the existence of an empress if sacred and noble. Everyone tried their best to calm her, but Belice cried every time the sword was pointed towards me,\u201d for a moment, it looked like he wanted to smile, \u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it? She was only an infant, but it seemed as though she were trying to save me.\u201d\u201cIs that how she saved your life?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they all said. The emperor back then came to the Temple and said that if they killed me, they would be killing Belice as well. And so, they decided to raise me as a sword, to protect her. I\u2019ve been holding a sword ever since I could hold things in my hand. I promised to become her sword and protect her\u2026 at all costs.\u201dHe\u2019d promised on that day, under the scared tree,\u2018I promise, Mother. I\u2019ll protect Belice. I\u2019ll never let anyone harm her in any way.\u2019\u2018My son, my Alex. You are the only one who can protect the Empress, your sister. Please, remember that.\u2019Amethyst\u2019s exasperated voice brought Alexcent back from the past and into the future, bringing his attention to her, \u201cThat\u2019s ruthless! I can\u2019t believe they were trying to kill a baby for such a thing! I can\u2019t believe secrecy about birth happens in either universe.\u201d\u201cAsh?\u201d\u201cI mean, think about it. It\u2019s not your choice to be born! You are not capable of choosing which property type to be born with. Why are you talking as though it\u2019s all your fault?\u201dAlexcent started laughing. Despite the frown on his face, he laughed.But Amethyst saw his sorrow. He acts as if he should not have been born and his life has no purpose, she thought. Trampling, pressuring himself to live his life in a way he didn\u2019t want, just to keep a duty he had promised. He denied his existence, living a life he does not own, as a property of another.Alexcent fell silent, but in his eyes was reflected his pain and sadness.Amethyst got up, approached Alexcent and hugged him gently. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone who should not have been born,\u201d she said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s the choices that you make after you\u2019re born that matter,\u201d her voice might have been soft, but she couldn\u2019t hide her bitterness.She found it quite ironic that she was saying all this to Alexcent. She was the one who wanted to disappear as if she didn\u2019t exist. What kind of contradiction was she making? It didn\u2019t matter, all she wanted to do was comfort him.\u201cYou are the main character of your life,\u201d she continued, \u201cNot Belice. Never let her be your master. Live a life you want to live, not the life someone else wants for you. Your life is your own. No one is going to live it for you\u2026 I hope from now on, you can do what you want,\u201d she spoke to him as though she were talking to and comforting herself.Alexcent slowly put his hand over hers, \u201cWhy are you saying all this?\u201d It had only been a few months since they\u2019d been together, why was she comforting him as though she knew what he\u2019d been through?And perhaps the most striking thought of all; how was it that he was comforted by her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Even though the comfort may seem clich\u00e9, something anyone could provide, each word seemed to touch Alexcent\u2019s heart with relief and calm. He smiled, though his eyes reflected the vast emptiness that he held within him. The smile passed a moment later and he hid his expression.\u201cDon\u2019t worry though,\u201d he said, \u201cI was able to get my revenge.\u201d\u201cRevenge?\u201d Amethyst was hesitant.\u201cDo you know what the first thing was that I did when I took up my sword?\u201d\u201cStarted a war? No?\u201d\u201cThat is true, but I exterminated, to be exact.\u201d\u201cExterminated?\u201d Amethyst didn\u2019t like where this was going.\u201cAll those people who were there that day. The Senate, the Temple\u2026 I killed them all,\u201d Alexcent said without feeling.Amethyst laughed humourlessly. Should she clap? Should she admire his drive or his cruelty? But then again, she didn\u2019t think she would be at peace to see people, who\u2019d tried to kill her in the crib, alive. \u201cI applaud you. If I were you, I would have done the same,\u201d Said her, out of spite.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026 different.\u201d\u201cDifferent?\u201dAlexcent looked up at her, \u201cYou weren\u2019t able to forgive what Dajal did, yet you compliment what I did.\u201d\u201cWhat you did is in the past now.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d he seemed genuinely curious.Amethyst sobered a little, \u201cBut did you really kill them all?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Alexcent shook his head, \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to kill one person.\u201dDared she even ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cJust an old man addicted to gambling,\u201d Alexcent said.Amethyst was confused, \u201cWhy\u2026 Why weren\u2019t you able to kill him?\u201d\u201cHe became the Hight Priest,\u201d Alexcent explained, \u201cEven I am not allowed to kill the High Priest. I was able to give him a taste of hell, which was much worse than death,\u201d judging by the expression on his face, he was displeased by the idea.Now it made sense to Amethyst. The High Priest was as high of a status as the Emperor, a position equal to the authority even. It was no wonder Belice wasn\u2019t able to do anything.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cif I should say his fate is good or bad\u2026 But is this a secret?\u201dAlexcent furrowed his brows, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Why?\u2019 You said you killed everyone who knew what happened back then except for one person. In other words, no one knows what had happened!\u201d\u201cCorrect, you are unexpectedly sharp-witted.\u201d\u201cThen I too will keep it as a secret.\u201d\u201cAmethyst\u2026 You don\u2019t have to,\u201d Alexcent said. When she made to protest, he carried on, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t kept as a secret.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d she asked innocently, \u201cIs it okay for me to recount what you just told to me to anyone?\u201dAlexcent\u2019s expression relaxed, \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019ll just have to kill anyone who hears about it.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Amethyst nearly shouted, \u201cNo\u2026 But if you end up killing people\u2026\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Alexcent supressed a smile, \u201cyou did compliment me a few moments ago\u2026\u201dAmethyst\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u2018He had to be joking about killing people.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll never tell anyone\u2026 So don\u2019t kill.\u201dHe pulled Amethyst onto his lap. He raised her chin slightly and gently kissed her on the lips.\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201dHer lips upon his matched as though two pieces of puzzle that fit together. The meal was no longer a priority as a thrill went through her tongue. She wrapped her arms around his neck and brought his face closer. Tilting her head, she pushed her tongue deeper. The kiss became frantic. It was only broken by Alexcent pulling away to speak.\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to continue\u2026,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI have something to show you.\u201dHe took her hand and got up, pulling her with him to the bedroom balcony. It was twilight, that blur of the light between night and day. The sky was darkening but not quite, it was full of different colors.\u201cWhy are we here all of a sudden?\u201d she asked.\u201cI can only use attack magic,\u201d he said, looking at her fondly, \u201cBut I can still make this for you.\u201d Alexcent flicked his wrist towards the darkening sky and lit it up. There was a sound of explosion. An enormous circle of light hovered in the sky before the flames bloomed and illuminated it with colors. Flames of so many colors reflected in Amethyst\u2019s eyes as she stared enraptured.\u201cAlex\u2026,\u201d she stammered, unable to fathom words to describe the beauty of what she saw. \u201cThis is attack magic?\u201d she asked.\u201cNot really,\u201d he said, looking at her, full of tenderness, \u201cIt is something we use as an alarm, to alert others of any surprise attacks. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d said Amethyst, breathless, \u201cIt is so beautiful.\u201dAlexcent smiled and flicked his finger once more to set off another explosion in the sky. The sky was lit up by flames, fiery and beautiful. Amethyst laughed and hugged him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Meanwhile, Gen was at his desk, still working. His work never seemed to end, instead whenever the Duke met his wife, his work increased. He tore at his hair angrily. The manual needed to be finished in order for him to be able to answer any question the Duke would ask.\u201cHm\u2026,\u201d said Gen to himself, \u201cI think this will do for now. I am going to go crazy over handling the budget for next year. Pon said Madam was taking care of the budgets and seemed to be quite skilled at it, perhaps I can slip this to her\u2026\u201dHe flipped through the documents, sorting them out, when he heard a loud explosion. Boom boom boom! Gen\u2019s hand at his chin slipped in shock. He got up from his desk and hurried to the window. What the\u2026. He donned his coat and rushed out of his office. His agents quickly got into step with him.\u201cMr. Gen,\u201d said the agent, \u201cI have multiple messages that needs your urgent attention. This is from Marquis of Gravia.\u201d He said shuffling the papers he had in his hands. \u201cThis one is from Duke of Rhoden, this one from Earl of Huam\u2014\u201d\u201cJust give them to me,\u201d he reached for them and walked in a hurry. He looked at the messages one at a time:[What does the flame mean? Is it an alarm? \u2013 Marquis of Gravia][Is this a declaration of war against the nobles? \u2013 Earl of Huam][Please report ASAP which the family this signal belongs to \u2013 Duke of Rhoden]\u201cShit!\u201d muttered Gen, \u201cThe nobles are going crazy.\u201d\u201cI will see the Duke and clarify,\u201d he said to his agent, \u201cWait for me.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d said the agent, \u201cBut you must hurry. The messages are constantly arriving.\u201dHe gave a curt nod and walked to the door of Amethyst\u2019s bedroom. He knocked twice and pushed the door open for he had no time to dally. Nobody had the authority to open and enter a lady\u2019s room without her explicit permission, but Gen was not there for formalities. This was a situation of great urgency. He saw the Duke\u2019s silhouette at the balcony, so he headed that way.\u201cYour Excellency!\u201d Gen addressed him with alarm.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Alexcent, looking annoyed at the interruption.Gen seemed taken aback at his indifference. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d he said hurriedly, \u201cThe nobles are frantic because of that signal. Why did you use your attack magic as though it was an alarm for an imminent war?\u201d Gen noticed, only after a moment, that Amethyst was standing by Alexcent\u2019s side. He faltered.\u201cDid you just\u2026,\u201d he muttered exasperated. \u201cWhich family is it this time?\u201d\u201cNone,\u201d he said, calmly.\u201cThen is this supposed to be a warning for something or someone?\u201d Gen asked, taking an effort to get to the bottom of this without losing his head.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, curtly.Gen felt his blood boiling at his short answers. His master acted as though nothing was amiss. \u201cWell, what the hell was that magic for then?\u201d he asked sharply.\u201cOh,\u201d Alexcent said, turning to look at Amethyst, smiling, \u201cI wanted to show her.\u201dGen was so flabbergasted that he laughed as if his words were so absurd to hear. \u201cJust because she wants to see some flames,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, \u201cYou use your attack magic?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\u201cAlexcent, are you drunk?\u201d Gen asked with brows furrowed.\u201cNo,\u201d he replied briskly.\u201cThen, pray tell me, is there something wrong with your head today?\u201d Gen asked mockingly.\u201cNo, I am fine,\u201d he said.No, I am fine, lingered in his ears and echoed to the deep part of his mind and his anger flared. \u201cWhat in hell is wrong with you?!\u201d exclaimed Gen, \u201cAre you out of your mind? Using your attack magic so lightly! Telegrams are coming from every corner of the kingdom, messages flooding in.\u201d He turned to him. \u201cTell me, what are you going to tell the nobles? If you don\u2019t prepare a decent response, they are going to take this as a declaration of war! Who is this hellhole will believe you when you say you were putting on a little show for your wife? Tell me honestly, you are doing this to push me to the brink, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI am not, Gen\u2026,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cThen what are you going to tell the nobles?\u201d Gen asked vehemently. \u201cThe Duke of Rhoden was asking which family the signal belongs to!\u201dAmethyst stepped forward. \u201cWhy would anyone blame the Duke for \u2018putting on a show\u2019 for his wife?\u201d she asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you overreacting? It was just fireworks.\u201d\u201cMe? I am overreacting?\u201d retorted Gen, \u201cHere, read these telegrams and tell me again if I am overreacting, my lady.\u201d He pushed the telegrams in Amethyst\u2019s hands. \u201cAnd please get it in your vain little head that these aren\u2019t just fireworks conjured for a little show for his wife. When the Duke uses Attack magic, it is either a signal for imminent attack, or a declaration of war.\u201d\u201cBut how\u2014\u201dGen cut her off. \u201cBecause the whole of the Empire made a pact to use such magic only in the face of war!\u201d He snapped.\u201cWhat\u2026,\u201d mumbled Amethyst, shuffling through the telegrams.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Gen said viciously, \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t! Try to get out of your little bedroom and learn a thing or two, why don\u2019t you? The Empire is divided into nobles and royals. Skad family is part of royalty. After the Great War, His Excellency\u2019s attack magic was limited to be used in the face of war only. An agreement was made between the nobles and the royals. His Excellency here has violated that agreement today. All the other families of importance will naturally protest and rally their armies if a war is going to take place. This is a very serious situation, and you call it \u2018just fireworks\u2019! How ignorant!\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is\u2026 Can\u2019t you just inform them that it was an act of love. That he did it for his wife,\u201d said Amethyst softly, \u201cThat it didn\u2019t mean anything offensive!\u201d\u201cLove?\u201d retorted Gen, \u201cWho would believe that? Tell me, how does \u2018the Duke used his Attack Magic for love\u2019 sound to you? You think that would make a strong enough argument?\u201d\u201cWell, that is the truth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Amethyst said.\u201cThe truth?\u201d said Gen, exasperated, \u201cYou really think that?\u201d\u201cI mean Alexcent loves me. I am his wife,\u201d Amethyst turned to Alexcent for support.\u201cDo you expect me to believe that?\u201d said Gen sharply.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d she asked helplessly.Alexcent scratched his head, thinking hard on what he should say, and if anything he said might be taken as a misunderstanding by both Gen and Amethyst. \u201cAsh, um,\u201d he said, after a long while.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Amethyst snapped at him. His silence was getting on her nerves.\u201cGen knows,\u201d he said, cautiously.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Amethyst, confused.\u201cHe knows about our contract marriage,\u201d he said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89\u201cHow?\u201d she asked, glaring at him. It was supposed to be a secret between me and him, thought Amethyst, helplessly. Why didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201cGen was the one who introduced you to me,\u201d he said, \u201cHe told me that you were the right person for it.\u201dAmethyst was stunned. No wonder he came to me at the ball, she thought, He knew I would agree to it because Gen told him so. And here I was, blabbering about \u2018love\u2019. How stupid can I be? I wish I could punch him right in his head!\u201cI see,\u201d said Amethyst, coldly.Gen shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat matters now is how we reply to the nobles.\u201d\u201cWell, Ash isn\u2019t wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cJust tell them I was stupid and made some flares for the sake of romance, for my beloved wife. Everybody marries for love. They don\u2019t have to know the whole truth.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d snapped Gen. \u201cAnd what if that doesn\u2019t work?\u201d\u201cThen I guess it will be a time for real war,\u201d he said, smirking.\u201cYour Excellency!\u201d exclaimed Gen wanting to wipe the smirk off his face. Many thoughts raged in his head. If it came to war, they would possibly win. But war was still fruitless and bloody. Perhaps for now I will just say that the Duke was so in love with his wife that he did it as a display of affection and pray it sways them.Gen sighed and pinched the middle of his forehead in exasperation. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cI will send the telegrams explaining the situation. I will also inform the newspapers on it. I will drop by at the palace and clarify the situation.\u201d\u201cYes, please do,\u201d he said, \u201cThank you.\u201dGen turned to leave. \u201cI will leave you two to it then.\u201d\u201cGen,\u201d called Alexcent. He turned. \u201cNo forgiveness next time.\u201dGen bowed. \u201cUnderstood, Sir.\u201d He left the room to prepare telegrams to be sent.Amethyst was confused about Alexcent\u2019s last words, then she remembered that it was a warning to Gen for entering her bedroom without her permission. Well, that wasn\u2019t going to sway her from the things he had clearly hidden from her.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d she snapped.\u201cAbout what?\u201d Alexcent asked, appearing sheepish.\u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cGen knows about the contract. And I made a fool of myself thinking he didn\u2019t. And about the attack magic.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask,\u201d replied Alexcent curtly.\u201cOh, how convenient for you!\u201d she shot back, \u201cGen arranged everything for you, including me and you excuse yourself from the fact you didn\u2019t mention it to me because I didn\u2019t ask! Who else knows?\u201d\u201cNo one,\u201d he said.\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that a relief!\u201d she said sarcastically and turned away from him.Aww, she is angry now, he thought. He approached her and wrapped her in his arms from behind, his chin above her head. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said softly, \u201cShould I make a flower for you this time as a token of my apology?\u201d\u201cAre those possible?\u201d she said, excitedly and remembered that she was supposed to be angry at him. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean I am not angry at you.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201canything is possible, if it is for you.\u201d He flicked his fingers and fiery flowers lit up the sky.\u201cDo animals!\u201d she yelped, \u201cMaybe a rabbit, or a lion.\u201dHe lit the sky with whatever she wanted to see. Amethyst cheered in his arms. There was distant voice shouting \u2018Your Excellency!\u2019, but soon it was buried by the explosion and cheers from Amethyst.Gen hurried over to the messengers after leaving Amethyst\u2019s chamber. He quickly wrote the responses and had the messengers carry it to the different estates. \u201cPlease deliver them, respectfully,\u201d he instructed them.Gen made his way to the carriage which was ready to take him to the palace. There were newer explosions lighting up the sky.\u201cYour Excellency! Please!\u201d he shouted at the Duke and Amethyst who were still there at the balcony. Either they couldn\u2019t hear her, or they were pointedly ignoring her. Gen sighed. He entered the carriage and indicated for the driver to start. He will have to hurry. Everybody in the palace might be waiting for a clarification.*The next day, all the headlines in the newspapers jarringly announced that the Duke Skad had overnight become the kingdom\u2019s most romantic person. Gen sighed, relieved but still stressed over the events that led to this:[Duke Skad, creating the one and only serenade for his loved one! Embroidered the night sky for his beloved wife][The absolute way how this man shows love. He will fight till the end for you!][According to a close aide to the Duchess, the nights are all reserved for her husband\u2026][Quite an event in the middle of the night! Duke Skad turns out to be the biggest romantic.][The cold-blooded Duke Skad, turns out to be the warmest lover to his wife][Now call me the master of events! The Duchess\u2019s number one fan\u2014 Duke Skad!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90\u201cPick it up,\u201d instructed Alexcent.\u201cWhat?!\u201d said Amethyst, trying to pick the mighty sword. \u201cAre you loose in the head? You can already see that I am trying and it\u2019s too heavy for me to pick up!\u201d\u201cJust trust me and pick it up,\u201d he said.Alexcent had dragged Amethyst from bed early the next morning for the supposed sword practice. She could barely pick it up, much less swing it. And, suspiciously, it seemed Alexcent was having too much fun seeing her struggle. She glared at him. Alexcent walked to her back and brought his hand on either side of her and gripped her hands which were on the sword. He frowned.\u201cWelcome your new master,\u201d he murmured, as though he was casting a magic spell.The dark red jewel embedded in the pommel glowed and suddenly the sword in her hands was feather light. Surprised, Amethyst lifted the sword and swung it around, feeling as though the sword was made especially for her.\u201cHow?\u201d she asked him, astonished.\u201cMagic,\u201d he said and winked.Amethyst rolled her eyes. She tried to swing and thrust with the sword. She quite liked the feel of it. \u201cI love this sword,\u201d she said, \u201cIt is so comfortable.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d he mumbled.\u201cSince you have used it so long, it must be very strong as well,\u201d she said.\u201cYes, it might be,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cYou can have it.\u201d\u201cWhat? No,\u201d she said hurriedly, \u201cBut it\u2019s your sword, you had it for the longest time. What will you use?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a sword,\u201d he said, \u201cI will have another made for me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d she said, \u201cI had one made for myself. It will arrive soon anyway.\u201d\u201cThat will be no more useful than a toy,\u201d he said.\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she said jokingly, \u201cThe weapon seller said he would put in a strong mana stone for me and imbue the steel with magic.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, raising an eyebrow.\u201cYes, and I will be mighty with it,\u201d she said.\u201cBut I will love it if you just use this sword instead,\u201d he insisted.\u201cWell, I could borrow it till mine arrives, if you insist,\u201d she said.\u201cJust keep it,\u201d he said, \u201cTwo swords are always better than one.\u201dShe looked at the sword carefully. The sword would indeed be better if it was handled by the mighty Alec himself, it even had a beautiful jewel! But she could hardly travel with a sword as important as this.\u201cShall we get started?\u201d he asked.His words broke her train of thoughts and she nodded seriously.\u201cIt is important to be able to handle a sword skillfully, but more important than that is to spot the weakness of your enemy,\u201d he said, \u201cSo your lesson will focus more on that.\u201d\u201cWeakness?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cEveryone has a weakness. If you spot that then you have the upper hand in the fight. If not, you will be the one who gets hurt.\u201d\u201cBut if I am very skilled in swordsmanship, do I really have to worry about their weakness?\u201d she asked, \u201cI can just focus on doing the most damage or deflecting the blows.\u201d\u201cMight be,\u201d he said, patiently, \u201cBut you can only last so much in a fight. When you tire, you will lose. You might have less physical strength than the other person, but if the other person is burly, they are bound to be slow. That would be their weakness that you can use to your advantage.\u201d\u201cOne could build one\u2019s stamina,\u201d she suggested.\u201cTrue,\u201d he said, \u201cBut Ash, this isn\u2019t like sparring. When sparring, no one is trying to fatally hurt the other. But in a fight, the other party seeks to harm you. Your stamina and your strength can only protect you so long. You need to be able to spot their weakness and defeat them.\u201dAmethyst nodded. \u201cSo how do we find out the weakness of an opponent?\u201d\u201cYou have to keep a close eye on them,\u201d he said.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s obvious,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd then what?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.Amethyst tried to figure out whether he was mocking her. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.\u201cI mean when you look at them,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you look at a person and detect their weakness at just one glance.\u201d\u201cWell, yes,\u201d he said, as surprised as her.\u201cIt must be a skill that only you have,\u201d she said.\u201cI think anyone is capable of doing that,\u201d he said, eyebrows furrowed.\u201cNo, Alec,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not something everyone can do.\u201d\u201cThen how do people fight?\u201d he asked, confused, \u201cWait. Is that why people are so weak when they fight me?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me?!\u201d exclaimed Amethyst, \u201cI hardly know anything about fighting.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, genuinely confused.Amethyst scoffed. \u201cShow off,\u201d she said.\u201cI thought everyone fought that way\u2026,\u201d said Alexcent mumbling to himself, \u201cWait, what did you call me?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d said Amethyst hastily, \u201cSo, you see your opponent\u2019s weakness at just a glance?\u201d\u201cSeems to be,\u201d he said.Amethyst jutted out her chin and stood defiantly.\u201cIf you are so confident,\u201d she said, \u201cTell me, what is my weakness?\u201dAlexcent narrowed his eyes. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cTo put it bluntly, your weakness is this.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her waist, tilted her head up and placed a kiss on her lips. Amethyst\u2019s mouth parted a little and his tongue found hers. He pulled her closer to him and deepened the kiss.Instantly, Amethyst\u2019s thoughts scattered. She felt weak in her knees. His kisses always undid her. She vaguely heard her sword drop from her hands as she wrapped them around his neck and pulled him closer.If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!Patreon is not compulsory.

    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 \u2013 Two Rascals\u201cWell, isn\u2019t today another amazing day\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bet so\u2026\u201dA few feet away, Leyrian and Buer were hiding from sight, watching Alexcent and Amethyst at their supposed \u2018sword practice\u2019.\u201cBy the way, when do you think those two will be over?\u201d Leyrian said as they watched the couple wrapped in each other\u2019s arms.\u201cHopefully soon.\u201d\u201cNot by the looks of it. Shall we make a bet?\u201d\u201cOn what?\u201d\u201cWhether it will be over soon or not.\u201dAt Leyrian\u2019s words, Buer thought for a moment and said, \u201cThen I bet it won\u2019t end at all.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t an option like that!\u201dInstead of answering, Buer hit Leyrian on the chest with his elbow, jokingly.*\u201cHm\u2026Alec,\u201d she said between kisses. \u201cYou should be teaching me.\u201dAlexcent pulled away. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said softly, \u201cWhy are you so eager to learn swordsmanship and shooting?\u201d\u201cBecause in a year, or maybe a few months, I will no longer be the Duchess,\u201d she said feeling drunk on his kiss that she had said aloud what was only in her thoughts.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Alexcent sharply.His steely voice brought her back to attention. \u201cWhat do I mean?\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cAlexcent, we are under a contract marriage. When the contract is over, I will no longer be a Duchess. I need to learn to protect myself! I can\u2019t spend my life depending on others for safety.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d he said bitterly. Then he went silent. It was true, but truth can be difficult to digest.Well, it\u2019s out in the open now, thought Amethyst, trying to gauge Alexcent\u2019s reaction. He seemed distant and aloof. She had expected this to develop into a scene but seeing Alexcent taking the news so silently unsettled her.\u201cWell,\u201d he said after a long silence, \u201cThat\u2019s it for today\u2019s lesson.\u201d He turned and walked away. Amethyst lifted the sword that had fallen to the ground.\u201cAlec!\u201d she called. He turned and their eyes met for a brief moment. \u201cYour sword,\u201d she said holding it forward.\u201cI told you,\u201d he said in a steely tone, \u201cYou can keep it.\u201d He then left the field.*Amethyst spent the afternoon resting in her bedroom. She lay down and tried to make herself not think too much on the coldness in Alexcent\u2019s tone when she had told him about her reasons for her eagerness to learn swordsmanship and shooting.His cold tone of voice pierced at her heart. No matter what she did, it bothered her. Her mind was in a state of disarray. What is up with him? She wondered. Usually, the heroine in the novels moved to the next level when they died or went into another body. She had thought she was trapped in space and would someday be able to go back. She also pondered if she went back, would she appear at the same moment she had disappeared from another world? She wanted to live a free life. She was so sure that it was only a matter of time till she could go back. So, she had agreed to Alexcent\u2019s conditional proposal, despite not wanting to marry. He knows about the one-year deadline, so why does he have to act so bitter?She sighed and traced the embroidery across her blanket. I can\u2019t take this anymore! Maybe if I move a bit, or do something, it will help me calm down. Alec does have a knack for making people nervous and disturbed!She got up from the bed and changed into something comfortable. She picked Alexcent\u2019s sword and headed outside. She walked to the field. She could see that the training was over and only a few knights were loitering in the field.Leyrian noticed Amethyst walking towards the field with sword in hand. He approached her. \u201cForgive me, Ma\u2019am, but why are you here at this hour,\u201d he said, \u201cDidn\u2019t the training end this morning?\u201d\u201cOh, I am just here to practice what I learnt today,\u201d said Amethyst, then frowned, \u201cWait, how do you know I was training this morning?\u201d\u201cWell, I had heard that you always train in the morning with his Lordship,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cI, too, train in the mornings.\u201dBut Amethyst saw his nervous reaction and sort of guessed what was happening. \u201cThat early?\u201d she asked, narrowing her eyes.Buer approached her too, sweating after his training. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd I would be right in assuming Sir Buer would have been present too?\u201dThey both looked guilty as sin. \u201cMadam,\u201d he said apologetically, \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to peek.\u201d\u201cPeek?!\u201d asked Amethyst, aghast, \u201cWhat did you see?\u201cWe are so sorry, Madam,\u201d said Leyrian.The way they looked, Amethyst could have forgiven them until she noticed Buer elbowing Leyrian on the ribs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 \u2013 A Rare WeaponWell, what can I do? They have already seen us. And technically, it is not their fault, not mine either. It\u2019s Alec\u2019s fault, wooing me every chance he gets! Amethyst thought.\u201cIt is not proper to peek,\u201d she said to them, \u201cBut it\u2019s alright if you didn\u2019t mean it deliberately.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding, Madam,\u201d said Leyrian, \u201cEver so grateful!\u201d\u201cDo you really feel grateful?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cOf course, Madam,\u201d said Buer.\u201cThen as a token of your gratitude,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cTeach me how to use the sword.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d exclaimed Leyrian, \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cFine then,\u201d interrupted Amethyst, \u201cI will just tell Alec about you two sneaking about and watching us practice in the morning.\u201d\u201cNo, please!\u201d said Buer, positively horrified.Leyrian seemed very displeased and trapped. If Alexcent found out about his knights peeking at the Duchess and himself \u2018practicing\u2019 their swords in the morning, the Duke will surely have their heads for it.\u201cI will teach you the basic posture and position,\u201d obliged Leyrian, reluctantly.\u201cThank you!\u201d said Amethyst and lifted her sword.Buer gasped. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the Duke\u2019s sword?\u201d he asked.\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Amethyst.\u201cHow were you able to get that precious thing?\u201d asked Buer aghast.\u201cPrecious?\u201d asked Amethyst confused. Alexcent had given it to her saying it was \u2018just a sword\u2019.\u201cYes!\u201d said Buer, \u201cThere is only one sword like that in the entire world, and at the moment it is in your hands. It is very rare, this sword.\u201d\u201cOnly one?\u201d asked Amethyst, surprised.\u201cYes,\u201d said Buer, \u201cForgive me, Madam. But can I hold it for a second?\u201dAmethyst placed the sword in his outstretched hand. He lifted it and swung it once. \u201cDo you see the dark red jewel here?\u201d he asked, indicating the jewel on the pommel, as he handed the sword back to her, reverently. \u201cThe jewel was supposedly held by the goddess herself when she descended to the earth. It is called the soulstone.\u201d\u201cThe soulstone?\u201d she asked.Buer nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, \u201cIt had great mana, incomparable to anything in the world. The sword is just like any other sword. But the gem gives it its power. It is almost a living being.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Alec\u2026,\u201d she trailed off.\u201cSorry,\u201d said Buer, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cAlec murmured something to it, and it became very light for me to lift and swing with it,\u201d she said recalling the incident.\u201cThat\u2019s only the surface of what the sword can do,\u201d Buer explained, \u201cBut the Duke had never allowed near the sword, much less touch it.\u201d He looked at Amethyst.\u201cHe let me borrow it until mine arrives,\u201d she said. Alec had so nonchalantly given it to me, Amethyst thought, what\u2019s he playing at, giving something as powerful and rare to me like a toy he couldn\u2019t care less about?\u201cI see,\u201d said Buer, \u201cWell the Duke is very skilled. He can wield any sword powerfully, whether magical or ordinary.\u201d\u201cIs he that good as swords?\u201d she asked.\u201cHe is extraordinary,\u201d Buer said, excitedly, \u201cYou should see him in a battle. He gauges the opponent\u2019s weakness at a glance. None can stand against him. The knights adore him.\u201d\u201cBuer!\u201d thundered Leyrian startling both Buer and Amethyst. \u201cMadam, please don\u2019t take his words to heart, Buer only means respect.\u201dAmethyst found Leyrian\u2019s outburst strange. Of course, Buer meant respect. He was practically drooling at the sword and Alexcent\u2019s fighting abilities. What else would it mean? Anyway, I will return Alec\u2019s sword once mine arrives, thought Amethyst, I can\u2019t possibly take this precious and rare thing.Leyrian walked to her and began instructing her on the posture and holding the sword and swinging it in a way that it could do most damage.*\u201cMr. Pon,\u201d Gen called, as he saw him walking through the hallway, \u201cI was just coming to visit you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d asked Pon.\u201cYes,\u201d said Gen, \u201cThis is the document for extra budget for the upcoming festival. Can you kindly pass it to the Duchess, please?\u201d\u201cTo the Duchess?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s her responsibility to greet the guests at the annual festival, she will need the extra budget to prepare for things.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Pon, but didn\u2019t take the document. He looked reluctant. He thought that if the Duchess put off her work, and it was a big festival, it would fall on him. Which would be too much work in addition to the work he was bogged down with.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Gen, \u201cI remember you saying that she was very good at handling budgets. Is there a problem?\u201d Gen had heard Pon commending the Duchess on her skills on handling the account book and cutting down on unnecessary expenses. She had hoped that she could slip this work to the Duchess so that she could get on with her other works. In the past, she had handled everything. But now, since the Duchess\u2019 position was no longer empty and she had been hearing of her capabilities, Gen thought it would be apt to let the Duchess handle the budget for the festival.\u201cNone at all,\u201d stammered Pon, \u201cI will pass it on.\u201d He took the document from Gen who then bid him goodbye and walked to his office. Pon made his way to Amethyst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 \u2013 Duties of a DuchessIt was a sunny day, serene and peaceful. But Amethyst felt far from it. After the incident at the training, things were a bit awkward between her and Alexcent. It wasn\u2019t very obvious though that might be because she barely met him. She vaguely remembered in her drowsy state from sleep that Alexcent came to her night late in night. Then she fell asleep. She hadn\u2019t met him in the morning again.Amethyst sat at a dainty table at the garden, drinking tea. She saw Pon walking towards her. \u201cPon!\u201d she called, \u201cJust in time. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cPease go ahead.\u201d\u201cIs your original name really Pon?\u201d she asked, distracted.\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cMy full name is actually Forte.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cWhy does everyone has such short names here? I notice that everyone\u2019s name is cut short. Is there a reason for it?\u201d\u201cWell, His Excellency had it shortened while addressing,\u201d said Pon, \u201cSince the names are long and time-consuming.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Amethyst, thinking, \u201cDoes that include Gen and Hill, and everyone else?\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d he said.\u201cThen by any chance, does Alec call the Empress\u2026 Bell?\u201d she asked, excited. Although, she didn\u2019t recall Alec ever calling the Empress \u2018Bell\u2019.\u201cI am afraid not,\u201d he said, \u201cIt would see rude to call the Empress in such a manner.\u201d Pon hesitated. \u201cBut when His Excellency was younger, he would address the Empress as \u2018Hey\u2019\u201dAmethyst laughed. It was strange to think of Alec, young and na\u00efve, calling his sister \u2018Hey\u2019.Their conversation was halted by the brisk arrival of the servant, Lunia, \u201cMadam,\u201d she addressed Amethyst.\u201cLunia,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cNo, Madam,\u201d said Lunia, looking Solemn. \u201cI am a little worried about Roman.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.\u201cI think she is having trouble managing the separate house,\u201d said Lunia.\u201cIn what manner?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cThe employees there tend to underestimate her as the manager, since she formerly worked there as a maid,\u201d she said, \u201cShe seems to be having a hard time controlling the workers.\u201d\u201cWhen Dajal was in charge, he ruled with an iron fist,\u201d said Lunia, \u201cNobody dared disobey.\u201d\u201cDajal used violence, he abused the workers,\u201d said Amethyst firmly.\u201cI think more discipline is needed,\u201d said Lunia, \u201cWork isn\u2019t getting completed because Roman\u2019s authority is being undermined. Time is running out to prepare for the annual festival.\u201d\u201cAnnual Festival?\u201d asked Amethyst.Pon chose this moment to speak up, as though he had been waiting for a chance. \u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Pon,\u201d There will be an annual festival soon enough. It is the reason I came to visit you. This is the extra budget added for the annual festival.\u201d He handed her the document.Amethyst took the document and looked at it. \u201cWhat is the Annual Festival?\u201d she asked.Pon began to talk in detail. \u201cThe Empire\u2019s parliament this year will soon be over. During the three months of the Congress\u2019s reopening, aristocratic households are holding a meeting to gather their heritages. That\u2019s the annual festival.\u201d\u201cA meeting?\u201d\u201cYes, until a new parliament is launched, indirect and direct heritage of the family will gather to discuss about next year\u2019s budget, taxes to collect, new projects to close, and will come to a consensus to submit them to the parliament next year. That\u2019s how Congress restarts, discussing approval and distribution of subsidies for new projects, conducting audits on projects that ended, and discussing national events. Before the new parliament begins, the annual festival is needed for the aristocratic families to consult and receive the budget for next year. And the indirect heritage families will soon be arriving to participate in the annual festival.\u201d\u201cAnd how long does this festival last?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201d It lasts about a month.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd greeting the guests is the responsibility of the Duchess,\u201d said Pon, \u201cWhich falls on you.\u201dAmethyst nodded. The Annual Festival is a big fancy family reunion of a sort, then. All the skad family or relatives will be gathered, she thought, damn it, I guess being a Duchess has its disadvantages. I hate family reunions.Amethyst also knew that that there were unfair expectations and responsibilities especially placed on women. The tables were prepared for a meal. The men in the family ate first, then the children and lastly, the women. Which was very unfair. Sitting at a table eating the cold leftovers. She wasn\u2019t really looking forward to it.The chores would be never-ending. Preparing food, setting the table, washing the dishes. Well, she deserved a rest before she dived into the work. And no matter how devotedly she accomplished it, a slight dissatisfaction would always be followed by nagging of \u2018insincerity\u2019 or being not very genuine for the families\u2019 presence. Sigh.Maybe the Skad family reunion will be different, she hoped, maybe it won\u2019t be as brutal and ruthless as what I went through. Or maybe they are petty. What if I prepare it extravagantly and they blame me for being wasteful, or if I am a little resourceful, then they will blame me for not upholding the glory of the family. This is terrifying!\u201cThen prepare the festival same as last year,\u201d suggested Amethyst.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Pon, shocked, \u201cBut this is your first time introducing yourself to the family\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure nothing I do will be enough,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cSo it is better to just stick to whatever had been going on in these festivals. I also need to figure out this festival before I begin to prepare for it. So please prepare this year\u2019s festival the same as last year. I will gather enough information to think of something for next year.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026would that be all right?\u201d Pon asked.\u201cYes,\u201d said Amethyst firmly, \u201cSo please do as I say.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 \u2013 A Little GamePon seemed to want to say something but caught himself in the middle of it and thought better. Amethyst, on her part, wanted to ask more about the event but chose not to dwell too much on it.\u201cBy the way, how many families are attending this time?\u201d asked Amethyst, nonchalantly.\u201cThere are seven families, including three Nobles,\u201d said Pon.\u201cJust seven?\u201d she muttered. She thought the number of families seemed very little compared to the size of the festival this was going to be.\u201cAfter your Excellency inherited the Duke of Skad, he excommunicated many families, and now there are only seven left,\u201d responded Pon, attentively, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that there were more families in the past.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll post the information on each family in a separate document,\u201d he said, \u201cIt might be helpful if you read it in the meantime.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, thank you,\u201d she said, gratefully, \u201cAnd\u2026 Lunia?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d asked Lunia.\u201cI have to prepare for the annual festival\u2026,\u201d she said, \u201cYou said the workers aren\u2019t obeying, did you?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cPunishing and using a stick might be faster\u2026but I\u2019d rather use the carrot.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you know\u2026 a compliment sticker board?\u201d\u201cCompliment\u2026 stickers?\u201d\u201cHaha, I guess you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cPon, can you lend me some paper and pen?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d said Pon, handing her a paper and a pen.Amethyst explained as well as she could by drawing on the paper to make it clearer. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a three-line table for each of the five spaces and stamp on it once a maid has done their work accurately and quickly,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cIf they can collect these stamps five times, they will get a reward\u2026.\u201dWhat would be good for a reward? Amethyst thought. Perhaps money!\u201cIf they collect it five times, they will get a 10 percent bonus,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cand the whole procedure will be repeated\u2026 once they reach to 10 times they can go on paid day vacation. If they do it 20 times, they get a 20 percent raise in their salary. There is no harm in trying. If this doesn\u2019t work, we will find some other way.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d said Lunia.\u201cPon, make a compliment sticker board for all the maids and distribute it,\u201d she instructed, \u201cAnd let\u2019s have Roman handle the stamps. It might be confusing at first but once one or two manage to receive the reward, others will follow.\u201d\u201cI think this is a great idea!\u201d said Pon.\u201cAnd\u2026I\u2019ll stamp Lunia and Pon myself!\u201d declared Amethyst.\u201cWhat? Us too?\u201d asked Lunia.\u201cOf course! We can\u2019t have one rule for a group of workers and another for someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be fair. You guys can\u2019t get stamps and stickers from Roman. Distribute the tables to Gen as well as the knights and all the employees who work for the Duke.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s like a surprise event,\u201d said Pon, excited.\u201cIt\u2019s meaningful if we all enjoy it together,\u201d said Lunia.Pon, the efficient butler that he was, made it happen in the blink of an eye. He handed out the compliment board into a card and distributed it with the Duke\u2019s seal engraved on each and every one of them.The confirmation stamps were delivered to Amethyst and Roman, who would be the ones stamping on the boards depending the efficiency of the ones working under them. Ponwas the first person to receive a complimentary stamp on his sticker board.\u201cGreat! I am very proud of your efficiency Pon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou even have delivered the stamps!\u201d\u201cIt was no problem, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.\u201cThen please give me your compliment board, please,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat? Mine?\u201d asked Pon, surprised.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, stamping his sticker board. \u201cIt\u2019s a job well done, and you deserve this.\u201d\u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, looking at his first stamp on the board with a certain sense of pride. He had always been efficient but no matter how silly this idea was, it made him feel seen. It made him feel validated.\u201cI will work harder, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, smiling in joy.*The compliment stickers or stamps were all the rage in the household. Anyone who worked for the Duke were seen conversing and inquiring about how many stamps they had received.\u201cHow many did you get?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be getting a bonus now if I get one more!\u201d\u201cLucky you! I still need two more.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s finish these chores and get a stamp from Roman!\u201d\u201cYes! You have to hurry, in order to get a stamp.\u201dThe workers under Roman were no longer in mutiny. The first thing they did was check the number of stamps they needed to receive in order to get a bonus. They worked harder than before.Meanwhile, the knights weren\u2019t immune to the charm to the sticker board as well. They were excited about this change, as silly as it was.\u201cLeyrian, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s my turn to teach the Duchess\u2019s!\u201d\u201cSir Buer, it\u2019s up to her to make the choice who is going to be her teacher. I can\u2019t help it if she chooses me.\u201d\u201cYou said you already have four stamps! I only have one. Make a concession!\u201d\u201cNo! Collecting one more means a bonus!\u201d\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you greedy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not being greedy! It\u2019s survival,\u201d said Leyrian, winking.The two knights\u2019 bickering was interrupted by Sir Marcua. \u201cBoth of you, shut up,\u201d he said, \u201cI should be the Knight to look over Madam today. You both promised last time\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re out of this, Marcua!\u201d protested Buer.\u201cYeah!\u201d echoed Sir Leyrian.\u201cYou both are evil. Plain evil,\u201d said Sir Marcua.The voices of the knights echoed across the field.If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!Patreon is not compulsory.

    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 \u2013 Where Is MineIt didn\u2019t take Alexcent long to notice the enthusiasm and excitement flowing in his household. He wasn\u2019t immune to it, just like Pon, Gen and Lunia.Gen and Pon, at the moment were waiting in the Duke\u2019s office to provide a business report to the Duke. \u201cGen, how many did you get?\u201d asked Pon.\u201cI got one today,\u201d Gen said, \u201cWhat about you?\u201cI have already completed the first five and got myself a bonus,\u201d said Pon, proudly.\u201cUgh, is it necessary to gloat?\u201d said Gen, \u201cI need to get a chance to meet the Duchess to even get the stamps. It\u2019s unfair to me, I never see her as much as you.\u201d\u201cI am not gloating,\u201d Pon said, \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to receive such praise and compliment. I thought it was silly and I was too old for this. But it feels very strange and pleasant.\u201d\u201cUgh, stop bragging, will you?\u201d said Gen. He thought it was true though. When he first received the compliment board, he was indifferent to it. He though it was foolish to be treated like a child. But when he came across Amethyst in the hallway, she had praised him for his hard work and stamped his board. It had made him feel strangely happy. It had made him feel seen and appreciated. Now, it was all he could focus on. It also made him less grumpy these days.Amidst their talk, the door to the office opened and Alexcent walked in. \u201cWhat\u2019s all the fuss?\u201d he asked. After what happened in the training field with Amethyst, he had been in a very bad mood.\u201cAh, nothing, Your Excellency,\u201d said Pon, hurriedly.\u201cSo, what\u2019s in today\u2019s report?\u201d asked Alexcent.\u201cNothing special,\u201d replied Gen, \u201cAlmost the end of Congress, so everyone has been quiet.\u201d\u201cClearly not everyone,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this fuss in the household? It annoying. The whispers are never-ending. What in the world has happened that had made everyone so excited?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026,\u201d said Pon, and looked at Gen, uncertainly. \u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026 the Duchess has held an event to boost employee morale.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of event?\u201d asked Alexcent.\u201cYes,\u201d continued Pon, \u201cIt\u2019s a complimentary stamp system. If you do your job well, you receive a stamp. If you receive five stamps, you get a reward.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201ca reward?\u201d\u201cThe first five stamps mean a 10 percent bonus,\u201d said Pon, \u201cTen stamps mean a one-day paid vacation leave and so on.\u201d\u201cAh, so this is what the fuss is about,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cEverybody in the household is participating, Your Excellency,\u201d said Pon.\u201cEveryone? Even you?\u201d asked Alexcent, surprised.\u201cYes,\u201d said Pon, \u201cMe, Gen, Lunia, everyone.\u201dGen gaped, shocked from having his name mentioned in something so petty of a game.\u201cEven Gen, huh?\u201d asked Alexcent, eyebrows raised.Gen broke into a cold sweat hearing his name uttered. \u201cYour Excellency, I only received one stamp so far!\u201d he said, hurriedly, \u201cPon had already received a bonus and he is waiting for one more stamp to be off on a vacation.\u201d\u201cMr. Gen!\u201d exclaimed Pon, wide eyed.\u201cGive it to me,\u201d said Alexcent, frowning.\u201cSorry?\u201d stammered Pon.\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Gen, at the same time.They both looked at each other nervously. They had no intention of losing their cards, they still had many more stamps to receive!\u201cGive me that complimentary card or whatever you call it,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cNo!\u201d exclaimed Pon. Gen gaped at Pon\u2019s boldness.\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Alexcent.\u201cBecause I need to receive just one more for a vacation,\u201d said Pon, miserably.\u201cSo, I can\u2019t take yours and use it?\u201d asked Alexcent.Pon realized, with some surprise, that the Duke wanted one for his own, to earn the stickers. \u201cIt does not work that way,\u201d he said, as he reluctantly took out his compliment board from his pocket and held it out to Alexcent.\u201cIt\u2019s specifically designed, and you put your name on it,\u201d said Pon. He seemed to have taken very good care of the card as it was still new and shiny after being stamped nine times. The card was filled with \u2018you did a great job\u2019 stamps.\u201cOh,\u201d murmured Alexcent, \u201cWhere\u2019s mine\u2026\u201dPon let out a sigh of relief as he was dismissed from the office. Fortunately, the Duke wasn\u2019t very inclined on taking away his card, so he had it back. He felt bad for Gen who was still stuck in the office with the Duke. Well, there was nothing he could do about it. And Gen had betrayed him inside. Let him suffer a little, thought Pon with glee.*It was a very strange day. Leyrian stopped Amethyst before she left the field after sword practice.\u201cExcuse me, Madam,\u201d he called.\u201cYes?\u201d responded Amethyst.\u201cUh\u2026 I just wanted to say\u2026 the Duke,\u201d stammered Leyrian, \u201cYou did very well today, I just wanted to say that.\u201d\u201cThank you so much, Sir Leyrian,\u201d said Amethyst, gratefully, \u201cYou are a good teacher.\u201dAs Amethyst entered the household, she came across Gen in the hallway. \u201cGen!\u201d she called.\u201cHello, Madam,\u201d said Gen, cheerfully, \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a long while.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too, Gen,\u201d she said, \u201cYou look tired. Seems you have been having it tough.\u201d\u201cDo I look that bad already?\u201d laughed Gen.\u201cTake it easy, Gen!\u201d she said, \u201cYou need to take care of your health.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d he said, \u201cThank you. I will. But\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d said Amethyst, urging Gen.\u201cThe thing is, um,\u201d said Gen, \u201cNever mind. If you will excuse me\u2026.\u201d Gen walked away.Amethyst was confused. Clearly, Gen had something to say but thought better of it. Leyrian had been the same as well. I wonder what is wrong, she thought as she made her way back to her bedroom. Back in her bedroom, Lunia greeted her.\u201cMadam,\u201d she said, \u201cHow was training today?\u201d\u201cAh, Lunia,\u201d she said, \u201cThank you for asking. It was the same old. Posture correction again.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Lunia.\u201cBut why have you been waiting for me,\u201d she asked, \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026,\u201d trailed off Lunia.\u201cEveryone is being weird today,\u201d she said, \u201cSo many people have approached me as though they have something to say, and then they falter and change the topic of conversation.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Lunia, hesitantly, \u201cEveryone?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI can sense that they have a request, but they can\u2019t say it. I didn\u2019t press them thinking it might be a difficult request that they are having a hard time asking for.\u201dLunia realized that she wasn\u2019t the only one afraid of the wrath of the Duke, many, apparently, were dealing with the same thing and trying to convey it to the Duchess. There was a knock on the bedroom door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 \u2013 Special Rewards (1)\u201cCome in,\u201d said Amethyst.Pon opened the door and made his way into the room. Pon never came to her room, not unless something is urgent. It made Amethyst worried. I have a bad feeling about this, she thought, everyone has been acting weird today. I knew something was wrong!\u201cPon, is something amiss?\u201d she asked him.\u201cMadam,\u201d said Pon, gravely, \u201cI need to talk about something.\u201d\u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d asked Amethyst, worried at his grim expression.\u201cForgive me, Madam,\u201d said Pon, \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you make a sticker board for the Duke as well?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d asked Amethyst, confused. \u201cThe Duke?\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d he said, \u201cAt this rate, he might end up killing everybody.\u201d\u201cWhy would Alec need a compliment board?\u201d asked Amethyst, incredulously, \u201cHe is the ultimate authority.\u201d\u201cWell, if he had one as well,\u201d added Lunia, timidly, \u201cHe would scare us a little bit less.\u201d\u201cScare you?\u201d asked Amethyst, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dPon and Lunia frowned. It seemed both of them didn\u2019t want to talk about whatever has happened.\u201cAnd why in the world would he need a compliment board though?\u201d asked Amethyst. \u201cI mean it\u2019s not like he can be given a bonus, or a vacation.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026,\u201d said Pon, \u201cmaybe the reward can be something different for the Duke.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam,\u201d said Lunia and clasped Amethyst\u2019 hand tightly. \u201cPlease allocate the Duke a compliment board as well.\u201dAmethyst looked at them, stunned. Is this what everyone was trying to tell me? Gen, Leyrian and the others, thought Amethyst. Alec wanted a compliment board too? Why would he want the stamps? And what would he even do with them anyway?What am I supposed to give as a reward to someone who has everything? Amethyst thought. However, Lunia and Pon had looked positively distressed. She couldn\u2019t ignore their requests.\u201cOkay,\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cI will think of something.\u201d Pon and Lunia looked relieved.At that moment, Roman arrived in the room. \u201cMadam!\u201d she called.\u201cRoman,\u201d Amethyst said, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cOh, thank the gods, you are all here,\u201d said Roman. She greeted Pon and Lunia too.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is something I did. I might have made a mistake,\u201d she said hurriedly, \u201cI thought of everything, but I don\u2019t know where I went wrong. Forgive me for intruding, but I need to ask you if I did anything that is not up to the expectation.\u201d\u201cRoman,\u201d Amethyst asked gently, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What mistake did you make?\u201d\u201cThat is what I am here to ask you,\u201d said Roman, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cBut you are doing great!\u201d said Amethyst, \u201cLunia told me about your accomplishment in your work. It is highly commendable.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes, of course,\u201d assured Amethyst.\u201cThen why did the Duke visit the establishment with a very scary face?\u201d asked Roman.\u201cWhat? Alec visited?\u201d asked Amethyst, surprised.\u201cYes, he came in person,\u201d said Roman, visibly terrified, \u201cHe looked around. I thought maybe I had made a big mistake because the Duke has never visited the place before.\u201dEveryone was terrified of Alec and his unpredictable new behavior. Pon, Lunis, Leyrian, Gen, and now\u2026 Roman. Pon nodded with understanding and handed Amethyst a blank and new compliment board.\u201cI had it made,\u201d said Pon, \u201cIt\u2019s blank. Maybe you can fill it in.\u201d\u201cDid you have it prepared in advance?\u201d asked Amethyst. How terrified were they?Pon nodded. He, along with Lunia and Roman left the room with a pleading look at Amethyst. She looked at the compliment board in her hands. For others, there was reward of bonus and vacation and such. Wat could she put in the reward section for Alexcent?First reward column, she wrote \u2018A massage\u2019. What should I put for the second one? Amethyst wondered. A kiss? \u201cI must be crazy,\u201d she muttered. Last time when I went to the front door to meet him after work, he seemed to love it. In the second reward column, she wrote \u2018Welcoming at the front door\u2019. What should I put in the third column? She thought, Maybe a hug? Amethyst shook her head. In the third reward column she wrote \u2018Granting a small wish\u2019. Well, that seemed good enough.*Amethyst awoke and opened her eyes at the rustling somewhere near. A dark shadow lingered in front of her.\u201cAlec\u2026,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are you so late to come to sleep these days?\u2019Instead of an answer, he caressed her head, fondly. Amethyst woke up fully and blinked her eyes to focus on him.\u201cI woke you,\u201d he said softly. His low-pitched voice ringing in the silence felt gloomy.She wondered if his workload had become too heavy these days. \u201cAre you busy?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\u201cI heard the Congress will be over soon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t overwork yourself.\u201d\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d\u201cYes, obviously.\u201d Alexcent caressed her cheek. She felt his fingers on her cheek, warm and gentle.\u201cI have something for you,\u201d she said, and reached under her pillow. She found the compliment board that she had filled with the reward prospects and gave it to him.\u201cFor me?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a bonus or a paid vacation, so there wasn\u2019t much I could give you.\u201dAlexcent stared at the small compliment board. There were three columns for rewards that were newly filled:A massage.Welcoming at the front door.Granting a small wish.The rewards seemed too small for anybody else, but for Alexcent, it was the most precious thing he had ever received. His heart was filled with joy. He leaned down and kissed her on the lips.To his surprise, his wife pushed him down on the bed, her kisses becoming frantic. She bit his lower lip gently and invaded his mouth. Her hands slid inside his robe and found his skin. It seemed ages since she had been this close to Alexcent. Her hands trailed over his skin and stroked his stomach.She was particularly aggressive today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 \u2013 Special Rewards (2) | 18He gasped. Amethyst kissed his neck and nibbled at his nape to which Alexcent let out a soft groan. She wanted him to want for more. She wanted him to feel what he always made her feel. She places kisses on his neck, then his collarbone, and down on his chest. He let out a choked breath. Amethyst was rather enjoying his every reaction, his every gasp of breath.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Alec,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t match your usual rhythm today. \u2018m in a bit of a hurry over here.\u201dAcknowledging the hint of a challenge in her voice, Alexcent grabbed her and swung her to lie below him, locking her in his arms. His lips on her lips, her neck, her chest. She could feel his heat. He pinned her to the bed and traced her with kisses. His fingers entered her soft place and she gasped.\u201cMm\u2026 Alec\u2026,\u201d she mumbled. She curled her toes at his sudden rough touch which sent pleasure through her body. He slid his head down between her legs and kissed her senseless. He is out of his mind, thought Amethyst. She could only cover her face in embarrassment.He pulled his torso up and she could feel him between her legs now, completely aroused. He kissed her as he slid into her. She stiffened a little. He noticed it and kissed her gently on the forehead as his hand stroked her back to soothe her. He then thrust into her, slowly. Amethyst moaned. His movements became more aggressive, thrusting into her with vigor. She could feel the heat building.\u201cAlec!\u201d she exclaimed. His hands were at her chest now, caressing her breasts, kissing them and nibbling on them. Amethyst couldn\u2019t hold back her moans. As he rubbed her breasts, he thrust inside her with force. Amethyst bit her lips but the moans escaped. The more he heard her moan, the more aggressive he became until it was all sweet frenzy and Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but scream in pleasure.Amethyst\u2019s body was moving violently, roughly, and harshly, too much that it seemed her small figure was about to break into pieces.I will love her to the point where she can\u2019t even leave the bed. So, she won\u2019t be able to leave me, thought Alexcent with a moan escaping his lips.*Alexcent, who seemed to be in a good mood for a while, was extremely upset now. After entering the palace, he was aloof and prone to slightest provocation. Marquis Gravia wasn\u2019t a fan of Alexcent\u2019s anger either. He knocked softly on the door to Alexcent\u2019s office.\u201cCome in,\u201d came the harsh and curt reply.Count Lohikin opened the door and entered the room. \u201cAre you free for a moment, Your Excellency?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh, welcome,\u201d said Alexcent softening his tone a little. \u201cOf course, please come in.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d said the Count.The servant brought in tea in a tray and served it to both of them. \u201cPlease help yourself,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lohikin.Both gentlemen were known for their reserved nature, so an awkward silence spread between them.\u201cYou seem rather upset,\u201d notice Count Lohikin.\u201cOh, there is nothing to worry about,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201cJust a personal matter.\u201dLohikin worried if his daughter had done something wrong. Did Amethyst make a mistake? He thought, worriedly. \u201cEveryone seems rather worried,\u201d he said.\u201cThey are just worried I might lose my cool and lash out at them,\u201d said Alexcent.Lohikin put down the teacup. He was a straightforward person and never knew how to ask question in indirect manner. \u201cDid my daughter do something wrong?\u201d he asked, \u201cIf she did, then I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive her.\u201dAlexcent looked at him and sighed. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not Amethyst. She could never do anything wrong.\u201dLohikin was still looking at Alexcent, unconvinced. \u201cShe is doing great, I am doing great as well,\u201d assured Alexcent, \u201cThings between us has been more than fine. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThen as a count, I will do everything in my power to help solve whatever problem you face,\u201d said Lohikin.\u201cI lost something precious, and I am unable to find it,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d said Lohikin, \u201cWas it very important?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexcent. \u201cIt is very important to me. I hope I can find it soon.\u201dLohikin thought that the item must have been very rare if Alexcent was this worried about it. \u201cI am sure you will find it,\u201d assured Lohikin. Alexcent nodded.After a few, simple small-talks, Gen announced that the parliament was about to begin. The two gentlemen left their seats for the meeting. But even after Congress, Alexcent\u2019s spirit did not improve.He had told Lohikin everything was alright, but it really was not. Alexcent didn\u2019t utter a single word in the meeting, just sat their slumping with a frown. The Duke was in a bad mood and nobody wanted to contest that. They looked at each other cautiously, hoping for the meeting to end as soon as possible.Gen, noticing this, stepped behind Alexcent\u2019s chair. He leaned down to whisper in his ear. \u201cHave you searched for it everywhere?\u201d he whispered.\u201cYes,\u201d said Alexcent.\u201cEverywhere? Your clothes? Drawers?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Alexcent replied.\u201cStill couldn\u2019t find it?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you tell from my mood?\u201d\u201cWell, I am glad that you are aware that you are in a bad mood. Everyone is at edge seeing you like this.\u201d\u201cI swear I had it on me this morning,\u201d said Alexcent, \u201cWhere could it possibly go?\u201d\u201cMaybe check back at your residence once again,\u201d suggested Gen.\u201cHm,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cYou think it will be there?\u201d\u201cMost likely,\u201d said Gen.Alexcent stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day. Meeting is dismissed.\u201dMembers of the Congress looked gratefully at Gen, for having saved them all from His Grumpiness. As Alexcent hurried out of the office to his residence, the people whispered among themselves.\u201cI heard him say that he lost something,\u201d one whispered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 \u2013 Flustered (1)Members of the Congress looked gratefully at Gen, for having saved them all from His Grumpiness. As Alexcent hurried out of the office to his residence, the people whispered among themselves.\u201cI heard him say that he lost something,\u201d one whispered.\u201cWell, seeing him rush like that, he should find it in no time,\u201d said another.\u201cI wonder what he\u2019s lost?\u201d said one of the people gathered.\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s probably very precious,\u201d said another.\u201cThe Marquis Gravia, who went to get approval for next year\u2019s regional business budget, had a hard time dealing with his upset mood,\u201d said yet another.\u201cI hope he finds it quickly\u2026Actually, I just pray it\u2019s at the Duke\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cWhat do you even think he is looking for? Wait, Count Lohikin, do you know anything?\u201d\u201cRight, didn\u2019t you come in with the Duke before the start of Parliament?\u201dThe attention focused suddenly on Count Lohikin. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, hurriedly, \u201cExcept that it is very precious to him.\u201d\u201cHuh, I wonder what is so precious to the Duke!\u201d\u201cOh, whatever it is\u2026If we all look for it don\u2019t you think it will come out eventually?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a secret budget book?\u201dThe Parliament was stirred up by the Duke\u2019s grumpy mood. And since nothing good came out of the Duke being in a bad mood, they debated whether they should help search for it. It made sense to them all that it might be a budget book that had been misplaced.Meanwhile, Alexcent returned to his residence searching frantically for the missing thing. His fury and frustration were slowly growing as he rummaged and upended things in the room but was unable to find what he was looking for. If anyone came to his attention right now, even god wouldn\u2019t be able to save them.Gen, for one, prayed he wouldn\u2019t be the one. He sighed. \u201cJust try and think where you might have put it,\u201d he suggested. He was already sweaty with all the searching and shifting furniture and the like.\u201cIf I knew it, I would have found it already!\u201d growled Alexcent.\u201cThen it\u2019s better to give up looking for it,\u201d suggested Gen.\u201cWhat?!\u201d exclaimed Alexcent, \u201cNo!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean no?\u201d\u201cYou have no idea how hard I tried to get it!\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d said Gen, \u201cYou saved several lawmakers by leaving the meeting early. Such hard work.\u201dGen remembered Alec being in a good mood and showering Amethyst with various gifts to earn a stamp on his compliment board. He bought her earrings, necklaces, bracelets, flowers, dresses\u2026. He had gotten a good scolding from Amethyst for that but no stamp. Alec had gotten a stamp when he had returned early from work one day, where she had commended him on his hard work and given him a stamp.After trying various methods, only that had worked. It had taken him so long and he had indeed worked hard to earn that first stamp on his compliment board.When he had arrived home that day, Amethyst had asked, \u201cAlec, can you give me your sticker board?\u201dHe had handed it over. Amethyst had stamped a \u2018great job\u2019 stamp on it. His very first stamp! His eyes had fixed on that one stamp and his heart hammered. Finally! He was overjoyed. Since that day, he had finished his work early and rushed home on time to receive another stamp, and another. Now he had five! Today was the day he would have been rewarded by Amethyst but he had gone and lost the whole damned compliment board.\u201cGive me yours,\u201d he turned to Gen.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Gen asked incredulously.\u201cJust give me yours!\u201d he said, desperately.Gen wondered if something was wrong with Alexcent\u2019s head. Maybe frustration and anger had driven him mad. \u201cMine has six stamps,\u201d Gen said, \u201cBesides the \u2018rewards\u2019 written on the board are completely different from yours.\u201d\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Alexcent, sighing. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Maybe I am going mad.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d said Gen, \u201cI have got a brilliant idea.\u201dAlexcent looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRoman has the stamp, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d said Gen, beaming, \u201cAsk for an extra compliment board from Pon, ask Roman to stamp it five times. Copy Madam\u2019s handwriting in the \u2018rewards\u2019 column.\u201dGen thought Alexcent would jump for joy at his idea, but he looked more sullen than ever. \u201cNo,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cI can\u2019t cheat her that way. Ash stamped them herself.\u201dGen frowned. \u201cWell, if you take an extra compliment board and ask you wife to fill it again, she might do it.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell her I lost it. We need to find it somehow!\u201dAlexcent began to check nook and cranny. Gen reluctantly slumped in a chair over a desk and began searching through the documents one by one. This was going to be a long day.*Amethyst was leaving her bedroom to go to the field to train when she found something stuck in the cracks of the door. She pulled it out. It was Alec\u2019s compliment board.I will give it to him later when he gets back, she thought and put it in her pocket. As she was walking, she passed Pon in the hallway.\u201cMadam,\u201d said Pon, \u201cLeaving for the field?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss my training.\u201dPon nodded. \u201cThere is a telegram for you,\u201d he said.\u201cFor me?\u201d she asked, surprised. There was no one close enough to her who would exchange messages.\u201cYes, from Count Lohikin,\u201d said Pon.\u201cAh,\u201d she said, \u201cMust be my mother.\u201d\u201cActually no,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s from the Count himself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u2013 Flustered (2)\u201cMy father?\u201d she asked surprised yet again. She took the envelope from Pon and opened it. It read:[Dear Amethyst,The Duke doesn\u2019t look very well today.I heard he lost something valuable\u2026 I think it would be nice if you could find it and help him.P.S. I\u2019d like for you to visit the mansion some time. We miss you very much.]It was a simple telegram without many details. Alec isn\u2019t well? she wondered. What did he lose that is bothering him so much? So much so that father had to send me a message personally. I will ask Alec when he gets back.\u201cForgive me, Madam, may I ask what it\u2019s about?\u201d asked Pon.\u201cIt isn\u2019t much. He just asked me to visit the mansion more often.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have to find time soon. Oh, I guess the annual festival is going to happen soon. I\u2019ll have to go after the festival.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAmethyst continued walking through the hall where she encountered Gen. \u201cMadam!\u201d he called.\u201cGen?\u201d asked Amethyst worriedly. He seemed flustered. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cPlease save me,\u201d he said. He looked ragged. Tangled hair, dusty clothes and flustered. She had never seen Gen in such a condition before.\u201cSave you?\u201d asked Amethyst, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\u201cHis Excellency is going to kill me!\u201d said Gen, miserably.\u201cWhat? Alec? Tell me what happened,\u201d she said.\u201cHe lost something,\u201d said Gen, \u201cOnly you can fix the problem now.\u201dAmethyst had just read the telegram from her father urging her to help the Duke because he had lost something, and now here was Gen saying the same thing. \u201cWhat did he lose?\u201d she asked, \u201cI will do my best to help you find it.\u201d\u201cYou will?\u201d asked Gen.\u201cYes, of course!\u201d\u201cThen please stamp this and fill in the reward section!\u201d he said handing her a blank compliment board. \u201cHe lost his. And now he is driving everyone crazy in his anger.\u201d\u201cSo, he lost his compliment board?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said in an urgent voice, \u201cPlease hurry and fill it.\u201dSo, this was the \u2018precious\u2019 thing Alec lost, she thought, not knowing how to react. It seemed so ridiculous but adorable as well. She took out the compliment board she had found and handed it to Gen. \u201cHere, give this to him.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get it?!\u201d Gen exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you stole it!\u201d\u201cOh, come on Gen!\u201d she said, \u201cWhy the hell would I steal it when I was the one who made it in the first place, I found it as I was heading out. Alec seems to have dropped it in my bedroom.\u201d\u201cOh, your bedroom,\u201d he said, \u201cWe were ransacking the office searching for this. Thank you so much! Please keep it a secret from the Duke that I was here. He will kill me if he knows I told you everything about his lost compliment board!\u201d\u201cAl\u2026alright,\u201d she said. Gen always seemed a little bit hysterical and always claimed he was going to die by the Duke\u2019s hands. His work was getting to him maybe. \u201cTell him you found it lying around.\u201d Amethyst suggested.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d said Gen, surprised. \u201cWill that be okay?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d said Amethyst with a smile.\u201cThank you so much, Madam!\u201d said Gen gratefully, \u201cI will never forget your kindness.\u201d Gen took her hands in his and squeezed it gratefully before turning around and heading away in the direction where he came from.I never knew Alec would make such a fuss about it, she though. So that was the most valuable thing he had lose? Oh, who am I kidding? It must be something else that he had lost as well.*In their room, Amethyst watched Alexcent. He was shaking the water from his wet hair. Well, he seems to be in a good mood now, she thought. Father was worried about nothing. Maybe father just wanted an excuse so that I would visit him.\u201cAlec, water is dripping on the blanket! Use a towel!\u201d she slid up to Alexcent who was sitting at the edge of her bed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t dry it, you will catch a cold.\u201dShe lifted a towel and patted his hair dry. Alexcent sat still and let her fuss over him, closing his eyes. Amethyst smiled looking at him be at peace.Alec, you collected 5 stamps now, right?\u201d\u201cHm, yes\u201d he said.\u201cWell then, you deserve your reward. Come and lie down,\u201d she said, lowering the towel, \u201cI will give you a massage.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d he asked.\u201cYeah, unless you don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d\u201cI do want it,\u201d he said and lay down on the bed on his stomach. He wanted that reward so bad anyhow.Amethyst climbed on top of him, her legs on either side of him and began to massage his shoulders. His shoulders are really stiff, she thought. She didn\u2019t know if it was naturally this way or he was indeed stressed.\u201cDoes it feel nice?\u201d she asked after a while.\u201cHm,\u201d he said.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asked.\u201cNo,\u201d he said.She trailed her palms lower to massage om his spine and surrounding area at the middle of his back. She went lower and held his waist with both hands and pressed his muscles with her thumb. Alec could feel her on his hips, and he flushed. He buried his face in the pillow so she wouldn\u2019t see him blush.\u201cAlec?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDid you find what you lost?\u201d\u201cHe lifted his face from the pillow. \u201cHow did you hear about it? Was it Gen?\u201d\u201cNo. My father sent a telegram urging me to help you find something precious that you lost. He said you were distressed.\u201d She kept Gen\u2019s secret as promised. She wanted to know what precious thing he had lost that her father mentioned, surely it wasn\u2019t just the compliment board.\u201cCount Lohikin told you?\u201d\u201cYes, he said you were searching for something valuable. You didn\u2019t find it?\u201d\u201cI found it.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great to hear.\u201d\u201cYes, I was lucky.\u201dShe continued massaging him. \u201cStop,\u201d he said as her hands reached his hips.\u201cWhy? I am not done yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Your arms hurt, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201cI am okay, really.\u201d Alex sat up and pulled her close. He buried his head onto her neck.\u201cAlec, give it to me,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat?\u201d he mumbled from her neck.\u201cThe compliment board.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\u201cJust give it here.\u201dHe took it out from his pocket and handed it to her. Amethyst opened the drawer from her side table and took out her stamp. In the last row in the first column, beneath the five stamps, she stamped \u2018complete\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s one mission accomplished,\u201d she said, handing it back to him.Alexcent chuckled. \u201cYou are very meticulous in this.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d she said, \u201cI have to be.\u201dWith Alexcent\u2019s first reward, the stamping event in the whole of the household was coming to an end. Most employees had at least earned 15 stamps now and three rewards. The annual festival was near. Only some, including Alexcent, had yet to finish earning all the stamps for their compliment board.If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!Patreon is not compulsory.

    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 \u2013 Greetings (1)In a carriage going up to the capital where the palace was located, a lady with pitch-black hair was smelling red roses handed over to her by a maid.\u201cThe prince\u2019s wife huh\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoes it bother you after all?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ve been mentioning the princes\u2019 wife constantly.\u201d\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m bothered by some naive daughter of an aristocrat?\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d The maid trailed off, puzzled by the lady\u2019s show of distress.\u201cI guess I\u2019m bothered by the fact that the Prince is married.\u201dThe maid nodded. The cold, unyielding man of the empire. The man who only cared about money and power had married less than a month after his engagement. The whole empire was stunned. It wasn\u2019t just the empire that was astonished.There were the members of the Skad family as well. The collateral relatives consisted of Count Citri, Count of Glacia, Count of Onslow, Count of Renove, Baroness Houres, Baron Piamon, and Baron Zephyr were very baffled.It took them about a month to arrange things to get to the capital. However, Alexcent, less than a month after the engagement, had gone through with the marriage and it had made the nobles reel.They weren\u2019t invited personally to the Duke\u2019s wedding, which left a bitter taste in their mouths. So, naturally, everyone looked forward to the annual festival to see his bride.Among them, there was a specific individual who had awaited more than anyone else.\u201cWhat in nine hells was the Duke thinking?\u201d The lady\u2019s brows were furrowed in disbelief.\u201cThe empire is abuzz and is full of rumors that he is quite the lover.\u201d Her maid piped in.\u201cHa, do you really believe that? You can manipulate newspapers as much as you want when you are rich.\u201d\u201cI guess you are right. That amount of manipulation is probably something easy for the Duke to do.\u201d\u201cI wonder what he is up to.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026we don\u2019t know. He is always unpredictable. No one knows what he might be thinking.\u201d\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m looking forward to this festival more than ever.\u201d\u201cYes. I wonder how the Prince\u2019s wife would have prepared it.\u201d\u201cThen, we must get there on time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThen breaking the stalk of the rose, she muttered.\u201cIf the flower isn\u2019t to my liking, I suppose I can just break it like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201dThe state of the broken flower stalk must have been satisfactory, for she smiled before throwing it out through the carriage window.The red petals blew away and scattered on the floor as the carriage rolled by.***\u201cMadam, I, Roman and three other maids will be assisting you for today,\u201d declared Roman.\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t need assistance. Also, why Roman?\u201d asked Amethyst. \u201cWhat about her work?\u201d\u201cMadam, soon the relatives will be arriving at the Duke\u2019s mansion. We can\u2019t have someone of high standing as yourself to greet them without a single maid at your service. Other noble ladies will have at least three of them trailing them so you should also make the necessary adjustments.\u201dLunia was right. Noble ladies usually had two or three maids at their sides at all times. \u201cAlright. But will Roman be okay? I\u2019m sure her hands are already full.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s taking care of it as we speak. She has learnt from you, so she will be efficient. She will make it so that a few days of absence from her work won\u2019t hamper the flow of work,\u201d said Lunia, \u201cBesides, there is no one as trustworthy as Roman to assist you.\u201d\u201cTrustworthy?\u201d\u201cYes. Previously, the annual festival was held without the presence of the lady of the house. This time it\u2019s different. If any unexpected situation occurs, we need trustworthy maids at your side to deal with it efficiently.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like a Chinese drama where there is always some sort of plot twist.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cNothing. Alright. I appreciate your help.\u201d\u201cOf course, Madam,\u201d said Lunia, \u201cI will serve you wholeheartedly.\u201dAmethyst thought nothing of the sort was necessary. But she could feel the pressure of it, as well. She had simply thought the annual festival to be a reunion of sorts but seeing Lunia all aflutter, Amethyst couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous.\u201cAlso this is the agenda for the festival. There are still some adjustments being made to minor details, but it is not much different from last year so it would be good for you to refer to it.\u201dAmethyst took the document that Lunia handed to her. I suppose it will be good to know a bit about it, she thought.\u201cWe\u2019re having the feast on the second day and not the first?\u201d asked Amethyst.\u201cYes. Since the guests will be tired from the long ride here. The first day normally ends off with a quiet greeting,\u201d explained Lunia.\u201cAh, I see. And their meetings run for two weeks? So long\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the estimated time. Sometimes it may take shorter or longer. Usually, it takes longer as we are discussing the whole business of next year and the taxes we\u2019re going to collect from the citizens of the country.\u201dAmethyst nodded and listened to Lunia patiently explaining the whole thing to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
