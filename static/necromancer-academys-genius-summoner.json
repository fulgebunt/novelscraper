Thud.On the other side of the forest, the village men were logging. A burst of laughter could be heard. Maybe the humorous Robert made another joke again.Every day in this small territory was a peaceful, slow life.Nonetheless, Simon was quite content with his life here.\u201cSimon, what do you think is the most important virtue that a lord should possess?\u201dWhile thinking about something else for a moment, Simon\u2019s father, Richard, who was walking side by side with him, asked a question.Bewildered by the sudden question, Simon quickly racked his brain.\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u00a0 Is it sympathy?\u201dRichard chuckled.\u201cNot a bad answer.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s a good answer?\u201dRichard slowly raised his arm and placed his hand on his chest.\u201cIt\u2019s a warm heart.\u201dSimon blinked at the unexpected answer.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cJust like how leaves change their clothes in each season, the virtues required for a lord also change depending on the situation.\u201dRichard smiled, stroking Simon\u2019s head gently.\u201cA lord should be able to be a friend, a parent, or even a villain. However, the lord who treats people with a warm heart gains the power to convey their feelings to people in any situation. That\u2019s the bond of the relationship between master and servant.\u201d\u201cSir!\u201dRichard and Simon turned their heads.Several adults were carrying large logs on their shoulders, and judging by their expressions, it seemed pretty heavy.\u201cSorry for disturbing your walk! If it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019ll count on you for \u2018that\u2019, please!\u201d\u201cGladly, Charles.\u201dSimon looked at his father with a slightly nervous expression on his face.Richard Polentia was an ordinary countryside lord, but there was one special thing about him.\u201cStep back, Simon.\u201dWith closed eyes, Richard quickly and quietly recited a few spells and spread his palms. A pool of light floated up into the sky and transformed into a magic circle.Simon looked around, on guard. The magic circle started to activate, and the trees and bushes around started shaking.\u2018Here it comes!\u2019The ground trembled, turning into a black swamp, and the arms that rose from it trembled, as if longing for the sun.Their arms were made of pure white bones, and were without a single piece of flesh.Undead.Monsters with unconditional aggression towards the living.However, the complete opposite of that common sense was happening in this territory.Rattle.Rattle.The skeletons that stood up on the floor ran and started to help up the logs that people were carrying.\u201cThank you, sir!\u201dEven the villagers. Rather than being afraid of the skeletons, they smiled broadly with expressions that said, \u2018That\u2019s a relief!\u2019.\u201cKeep up the good work.\u201dThat\u2019s right.Simon\u2019s father was a necromancer.* * *Necromancers had ruled half of the world for a long time.It started with the Talheren empire.When the Emperor of Talheren sent 50 thousand troops to the Necromancer\u2019s stronghold, \u2018Kizen\u2019, to avoid their influence, only 10 necromancers were dispatched from Kizen.Just 10.And here, a historical event called the \u2018Rose Retreat\u2019 took place. The 50 thousand troops headed for Kizen turned tail and returned to the Empire\u2019s capital.After everyone had become undead, the capital of the Talheren was destroyed and the emperor surrendered to Kizen.Afterwards, the Throne of the Talheren was occupied by a rotten, decayed corpse which \u2018used to be an emperor\u2019.The Empire\u2019s civil and military servants bowed their heads to the chunk of a corpse, and tens of millions of imperial citizens were played around by a puppet show of a rotten corpse for 30 years.A short history of the Necromancer\u2019s power and terror.Necromancers, who, in time, emerged as mainstream and gradually expanded their power. Now, they exercised their influence over half of the continent, and the other half was occupied by the \u2018Priests\u2019, their only antipode.Now, after the decades had passed since the 100-year war between those two factions who went face to face, the continent enjoyed a somewhat precarious peace.\u2018\u2026\u2026But I guess that has nothing to do with our territory.\u2019Simon felt like this war history belonged to a country from a far-away place.The most significant recent events in \u2018Les Hill\u2019, the territory he\u2019d rule one day, was the cow of Charles\u2019 place, that hardly had any news, gave birth to two young and healthy calves, and Carlon having three stitches on his forehead due to slipping while swabbing the floor.Simon arrived at the Lord\u2019s Castle with a silly smile.Ah. The villagers insist on calling it the Lord\u2019s Castle, but in fact, it was just an ordinary treehouse.Compared to the poor lords with a small castle for their dignity, Richard, the Lord of Les Hill, was a simple man.Creak.\u201cMom, I\u2019m home.\u201dAs soon as he opened the door and entered the house, a comfortable and relaxing woody smell was given off. The firewood in the fireplace on the wall was burning with a crackling sound.\u201cSimon! You\u2019re home?\u201dA gray-haired woman in an apron popped her head out of the kitchen. It was Simon\u2019s mother, Anna Polentia.\u201cYeah. I just got back from helping out with the logging of the village.\u201d\u201cHave you eaten already?\u201d\u201c\u2026I ate lunch a while ago.\u201d\u201cI baked some bread with the remaining dough. Spread some jelly on it and fill yourself up.\u201dShe must\u2019ve been possessed by a ghost who died because it couldn\u2019t feed its son. His mother, Anna, was a person who satisfied herself by constantly feeding the people around her.Simon pretended not to hear and pointed a tray on the table.\u201cMom, what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s water infused with the Lehark mushroom.\u201dLehark mushrooms were poisonous mushrooms that were often found in the southern mountains, and if you put them in water, a green-ish oil started to float up.If you ate it, you\u2019d suffer from stomach aches or diarrhea for a week, but it was a different story if it went through Anna\u2019s hands.She approached and placed her hand in the water infused with Lehark mushroom as she rolled up her sleeves.Whoooosh!\u201cWoah!\u201dSimon, who was watching, exclaimed slightly.As soon as a white light flashed from her hand, the poison was neutralized. The green substances floating around disappeared like a painting, leaving only the nutrients of the mushroom intact.The white aura emanated from her body when she purified the poison. This power. often called \u2018divinity\u2019, was a symbol of a priest.That\u2019s right.Simon was the son of a necromancer and a priest.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon didn\u2019t really know what exactly happened between his parents.He only knew that the two of them had a forbidden love that seemed like a fairy tale, and that he was born as a result.\u201cSimon!\u2019Anna\u2019s voice was heard without him knowing when she returned to the kitchen.\u201cI baked an apple pie. Have some!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I-I got it.\u201d* * *The day passed like usual. Simon dragged his tired body and laid down on the bed.Les Hill was silent today, and it\u2019d be silent tomorrow.Simon fell asleep while having no doubt that this peaceful daily life would forever be the same.However,Flutter!The change had already begun.A letter from outside the window stuck to Simon\u2019s face.\u201cKuhuff.\u201dSimon raised his arm and removed the letter as he opened his eyes.\u201cHello?\u201dSimon batted his eyes at the unfamiliar voice.Someone was sitting by the window where the moonlight shone.A girl with beautiful silver hair down to her legs and a mysterious atmosphere. It was like looking at a forest fairy that just popped out of a fairy tale.\u201cThe time has come.\u201dA voice, sweet like honey, woke him up.Simon, who had been making a gawking face for a moment, quietly picked up his blanket and covered his head.\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t see me!\u201dThe girl came down from the window with an angry expression on her face.\u201cYou saw me! Wake up right noow!\u201dSimon reluctantly removed the blanket and sat up after her scream.\u201c\u2026How did you get here? Are you lost? Do you know where your mom is?\u201dThe girl let out a small sigh and smiled as if she had regained her composure. The moonlight shone through the window, and her silver hair shone even more.\u201cI got the right person. I\u2019m here to see you, Simon Polentia.\u201dSimon made a surprised look.She\u2026 knew my name.\u201c\u2026\u2026Me? Why?\u201d\u201cRead that letter.\u201dIt was a solemn voice for her age.Simon carefully removed the seal and opened the envelope. A rustling sound and a stiff piece of paper folded in half appeared.Bang!\u201cSimon!\u201d\u201cSimon, what was that sound just now?\u201dThe door opened, and Richard and Anna came in. The two of them met eyes with the girl with silver hair.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cNefthis!\u201dAs if this weren\u2019t their first-time meeting, the couple\u2019s faces brightened up. The girl also smiled and waved her hand.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Richard, Anna!\u201dThe three of them started talking with excitement. Simon, suddenly excluded, looked at them.His father, Richard, had an excited face like a young boy, and his mother, Anna, was furious that she would have to prepare a meal right now.\u201cSimon, greet her politely,\u201d said Richard.\u201cShe\u2019s Nefthis Archbold.\u201dUh\u2026 Hold up.I think I\u2019ve heard that name before.Nefthis Archbold.No. Wait. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026!\u2018The Nefthis Archbold of Kizen!\u2019The pinnacle of all necromancers that ruled Kizen.The one who caused the \u2018Talheren incident\u2019 and turned an Emperor into a corpse puppet.The Witch of Death who\u2019d lived for 300 years.That girl?\u2018Then what\u2019s this?\u2019Simon trembled and pulled out the letter.\u201cI\u2019ll officially give you a proposal, Simon Polentia.\u201dThe girl\u2019s voice echoed in Simon\u2019s ear like a lyric as he read the letter.[Kizen admission notice \u2013 Simon Polentia]\u201cCome to Kizen.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said it was to create a \u2018Core\u2019, but Simon was not sure about it. It was just extremely painful.After spending sleepless nights building the core for around four days, Simon got into the carriage with Richard.It was a large and luxurious carriage that didn\u2019t fit the territory\u2019s circumstances. Simon\u2019s mouth opened wide at the comfortable cushioning he had never felt before.\u201cStay safe, Simon.\u201dAnna waved her hand with tears in her eyes after finally loading two weeks\u2019 worth of lunch in the carriage.\u201cIf you feel you can\u2019t handle it, come back to Les Hill anytime.\u201dRichard, known for his uxoriousness, got angry, asking how she could say that to the kid taking his first steps.Simon, who had never seen them fight in his life, realized that his daily life had really begun to change.\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll depart now.\u201dAs the coachman drew the reins, the carriage wheels started to roll.And just like that, Simon, who had lived only on Les Hill his whole life, began his adventure.Of course, it was far from a comfortable carriage trip. In the carriage, Richard and Simon had a quick session on dark magic.\u201cTry breathing.\u201dBy that, Richard meant to use the \u2018breathing technique\u2019 that he taught.Simon took a deep breath, drawing the mana in the atmosphere into his body. It wasn\u2019t too difficult as he\u2019d practiced it countless times.\u201cNow, slowly move the mana inside you and pass it through the core.\u201dRichart assisted, placing his hand on Simon\u2019s chest. Simon carefully passed the mana flowing like a river through the core below his heart.Something changed. It felt like the limp mana had become more viscous and hardened up.\u201cNow let the mana flow through your arms. Yes. Let it out of your hand.\u201dWith the feeling of a clogged meridian being wide open,A black liquid appeared from Simon\u2019s palm like drops of sweat.Richard smiled as Simon blinked his eyes and looked down at his palms.\u201cWell done, Simon. That is the source of the power of the Necromancer, \u2018jet-black\u2019.\u201dAccording to Richard, there was a time when knights and magicians ruled the continent.Of course, they\u2019re currently weakened since Necromancer became mainstream. Knights couldn\u2019t beat necromancers in numbers, and wizards were no match in casting speed and destructive power.\u201cThe biggest difference between a necromancer and a wizard is the presence of \u2018jet-black\u2019.\u201dRichard stretched out his left hand. On his palm, blue mana rose up like a heat haze.\u201cMana has the properties of a gas. Because of its low density, it\u2019s difficult to bind, and tends to disperse in the atmosphere.\u201dThis time he stretched out his right hand. A viscous black liquid gushed out like a fountain and dripped on the palm of his hand.\u201cOn the other hand, \u2018jet-black\u2019 has properties close to that of a solid or liquid. It\u2019s made of dense mana, so it\u2019s easy to bind and change its shape freely.\u201dThe viscous black liquid that had been flowing on his palm suddenly surged upwards. It regrouped in the air and turned into flowers, waves, snakes sticking their tongues out, or windmills that spun.\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhen Simon exclaimed at the splendid show that started all of a sudden, the jet-black changed its form to a \u2018magic circle\u2019. Red light leaked out from the dark magic circle made up of numerous runes, as if a bomb were about to explode.The hairs all over his body stood up with a chilling sensation.Something\u2014Something big was about to happen\u2026!Shatter!The magic circle broke as Richard clenched his fist. The ashes that had fallen to the floor slowly disappeared.\u201cPeople who cause miracles based on this jet-black are called necromancers.\u201dSimon nodded like he was possessed.\u201cThere\u2019s not much time left for me to teach. For the rest of the time, let\u2019s focus on practicing a basic technique. Drawing jet-black with the core.\u201d\u201cYes, Father!\u201dThe practice of creating jet-black was more fun than he expected.At first, it was just a few drops of bubbles on the palm of the hand, but as time passed, the size grew, and the shape changed.There were clear results, so Simon immersed himself in practice, losing track of time. Richard also led him to be content with his quick achievements, and to not become impatient.\u2018\u2026\u2026What monstrous speed.\u2019Richard didn\u2019t show it, but he couldn\u2019t repress his astonishment inside.Just three days from a simple release to shape changing.This was really not normal.Considering that it took around half to two years for the average person to achieve shape changing, it was no exaggeration to say that Simon was a boy born for jet-black. Although Simon was his son, he had goosebumps in the middle of teaching.In fact, Richard already knew about Simon\u2019s talent. The only reason why he didn\u2019t make \u2018Core\u2019 for him was that he was waiting for the right time.An explosive talent when the ego and sentiments weren\u2019t established yet. Richard was a person whose biggest regret in his childhood was acting like a tyrant, and he didn\u2019t want to pass on such a mistake to his son.But now, finally, the time has come for Simon to blossom his talents. The whole continent would be amazed by the appearance of this child.Just imagining it gave Richard a shiver that ran through his body, making it difficult for him to sit still.\u201cFather! Look!Simon raised a jet-black that waved over his palms. Richard looked at it with a serious face.\u201cDark Blue. It\u2019s a beautiful jet-black color with a slight blue tint.\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s a good thing, right? Am I a rare case or something? Do I have talent?\u201cIt just looks cooler. That\u2019s all.\u201dSimon resumed practice with a gloomy expression on his face. Richard turned his head and managed to stop the corners of his mouth from twitching up.\u2018It\u2019s not easy to control facial expression, huh.\u2019Time passed quickly.From Simon\u2019s point of view, a week had passed without him really noticing the passage of time.And\u2026\u201cI can only come with you up to here, Simon.\u201dRichard suddenly notified him of this. Simon felt his heart sink.\u201cI thought you were bringing me to Kizen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your father has some complicated circumstances, so I can\u2019t set my foot in the lands of the Dresden Kingdom. From here on, you have to decide everything and take action.\u201dSuddenly, a feeling of extreme pressure came over him and he swallowed down his saliva. He would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t afraid of this change, as he had lived in Les Hill for 17 years.At that moment, Richard tightly held Simon\u2019s hand.\u201cI promise, son. You can do better than anyone. And\u2026\u201dRichard smiled brightly.\u201cI\u2019m truly proud of you.\u201dFrom hearing recognition from his father for the first time in his life, Simon felt a part of his heart pounding.\u201cI\u2019ll get going now, Father.\u201dSimon, who parted with Richard like that, spent his time alone in a huge carriage. Instead of wasting the rest of his time, he focused on training the jet-black.And another week passed.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cWow\u2026!\u201dHe arrived at Langerstine, the capital of the Kingdom of Dresden.Simon\u2019s impression from seeing a huge city for the first time was simply overwhelming.All the buildings were tall and large, carriages frantically crossed the road, and there were even crowds of people. He almost went dizzy at the sight he saw for the first time in his life.\u201cOutta my way! Outta my way!\u201dSimon stepped back in surprise.A large carriage more than 5 meters wide was running down the steep slope. The carriage was led by a horse made of bare bones.\u2018Undead!\u2019The undead were roaming around in the middle of the city.From the simple labor of pulling a carriage or rickshaw, to chores such as distributing flyers in the square.It was a sight that could be seen because the necromancers became mainstream in the era.\u2018Pull yourself together.\u2019Simon lightly tapped his cheek, then unfolded a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.<239 Kemmelroad, Langerstine SL1E 6AJ.><Guide on standby>\u2018So, I have to go to this address, right?\u2019Simon strengthened his resolutionWhether it be Langerstine or Les Hill, it was all a place where people lived. He just had to go to this address and meet the guide who\u2019d guide him to Kizen. Then everything would be solved.But he had no idea from just looking at this information alone.Eventually, Simon spoke to a woman with a mass of blonde hair who was standing with her back to him.\u201cE-Excuse me. Can I ask you something, ma\u2019am?\u201dSimon freaked out the moment the woman looked back at him.One of her eyes popped out and swayed.\u201cWhat is it, Boy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019ll be rude if you freak out. It\u2019ll be rude if you freak out.\u201cI want to go to the address written on this paper\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAddress? Let me see.\u201dSimon had a cold sweat at the sight of the swaying eyes growing longer and scanning the paper. Fortunately, he was biting his lip, so he could avoid making a sound.\u201cOh, Kemmelroad? It\u2019s one of Langerstine\u2019s famous places. If you turn right after going through the square above, you\u2019ll see an alley with golden tiles.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026! Thank you very much!\u201dSimon thanked her with a deep bow.The woman spread out her fan in her hand and covered her mouth, laughing.\u201cYou\u2019re a well-mannered boy, which is rare these days. I wish you good luck in Langerstine.\u201dLuckily, things seemed to be working out!Simon, who once again thanked her, moved energetically towards the square pointed out by the woman.\u2018\u2026\u2019And after a while\u2026A man who had been silently watching the whole scene spoke to the woman, just like Simon did.* * *\u2018I\u2019m finally at Kemmelroad.\u2019Why in the world was this city so complicated? After 20 minutes of wandering, Simon managed to get to Kemmelroad. As the woman said, the floor tiles were painted in gold.\u2018239, 239\u2026\u2026\u2019He walked while holding a note and checking the addresses on each building.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dSomeone from the other side appeared and talked to Simon.He was a bald man with sweat on his forehead. He took out his handkerchief, wiped his forehead once, and said in a polite tone,\u201cAre you going to 239 Kemmelroad? SL1E 6AJ, to be precise?\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened.How did he know the details of the address?\u201cAh! Perhaps the guide that Howl sent was\u2026\u2026?!\u201dThe man nodded his head.\u201cYes. I\u2019m Howl\u2019s guide! You weren\u2019t coming even though some time had passed, so I was looking for you, wondering if you might have gotten lost.\u201dAt that, Simon was greatly relieved and said,\u201cI finally met you. My name is Simon Polentia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Rowley, the guide of Langerstine. Well, come this way. You must\u2019ve accumulated a lot of fatigue from the trip, so I\u2019ll guide you to the inn first.\u201dSimon nodded his head and followed him.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to walk for about 15 minutes. I\u2019ll get you there as quickly as possible with a shortcut.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dAfter getting out of Kemmelroad and walking down the winding alleyway, Simon looked around in wonder.Everywhere you looked, it was all houses. The amount of wasted space was almost non-existent due to how crowded it was.The number of people of this city alone seemed to be several times more than the people living throughout the entire Les hill territory.\u201cI was really worried, sir. It\u2019s dangerous for an outsider to roam alone without a guide in Langerstine.\u201dRowley started telling a story.\u201cYou know the old saying. A sitting duck. This city is swarming with people trying to skin innocent travelers. Pickpockets, robbers, and even wicked traders. When we get to the inn, I\u2019ll teach you a few dialects of the Langerstine. It\u2019s a temporary solution, but it\u2019s better than not being able to speak at all.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re trying to rob me too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dRowley stopped walking.\u201cS-Sir? What do you mea\u2014\u201d\u201cYou often unintentionally look downwards.\u201dSimon pointed out his index finger and said,\u201cYou checked if the items were in the right place when you tapped around the bottom pocket of your vest, right? Looking at the width of the pocket and the crease, it looks like something like a knife is in it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRowley turned to Simon in a cold sweat.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Yes, you\u2019re right.\u201dClack.He acquiesced and showed the knife handle in the lower pocket of his vest.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Langerstine is a dangerous place. You never know who you\u2019ll run into in this kind of a narrow alley.\u201d\u201cFinally, the person I mentioned earlier named Howl was actually a made-up name.\u201dSimon smiled and supported the back of his head with his arms.\u201cYou took the bait right away when I asked if you\u2019re a guide of Howl. Johnson\u2019s favorite goat in Les Hill is named Howl. Do you perhaps run errands for the goats?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRowley, who had a friendly smile on his face, stiffened up.\u201cTh-Then you followed me even though you knew everything?

The well-sharpened blade radiated of brilliance.Tup. Tup.At the same time, one from behind Simon and two from the front approached him with brisk steps.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, it doesn\u2019t really matter who you are. And that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you fell into a trap too.\u201dRowley, having a more relaxed expression on his face as his comrades joined, wagged his fingers.\u201cPut everything you have on the food. Including your bag, clothes, and even underwear.\u201d\u201cEven underwear?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be ashamed of? You just have to pick up new clothes from the market and wear them.\u201dRowley pointed at the pile of trash behind him. The other gangs also chipped in with giggles.\u201cMhm. That place is the specialty of Langerstine. Who knows? If you\u2019re lucky enough, you could find a chest.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to avoid being sent to prison if you cover your important parts.\u201dSimon answered with a smile on his face.\u201cI refuse.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRowley and his comrades\u2019 expression became ferocious.\u201c\u2026This bastard.\u201d\u201cLooks like you can\u2019t grasp the situation because you\u2019re a bumpkin. Do you think we\u2019re joking around right now?\u201dThe man to the right of Rowley strode towards Simon.\u201cThis kind of bastard needs a bit of a stab to get themselves together.\u201d\u201cHey, wait!\u201dThe man who ran off, ignoring Rowley\u2019s voice, pulled out a dagger from his waist and thrust it at Simon.Swish.Simon twisted his right shoulder, shifting the center of his body like flowing water.The dagger flashed through the air, while Simon, who moved to the side, quickly grabbed the man\u2019s wrist.Crack!When he applied the force, the man\u2019s hand bent in a direction it shouldn\u2019t.\u201cK-Kuaaaaaaaagh!\u201dThe man whose dagger missed fell to the floor and let out a terrible scream.While kicking him in the face, Simon said,\u201cIt also happens sometimes in our estate. Scums who mix with good people and do things like racketeering, you know.\u201c\u2026\u2026Y-You bastard!\u201dSimon lightly shook the dust off his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s the job of the heir of the lord to clean up such garbage in an estate. There seems to be many people like that in this city too, so I thought I\u2019d clean up a bit since I\u2019m up for doing the same job. \u201c\u201c\u2026\u2026So, you were noble.\u201dRowley raised his arm and signaled. Five more gangsters came from the end of the alley.\u201cThen I really can\u2019t let you get away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon calmly warmed himself up. He thought it would be two or three at most, but the gang was more numerous and organized than he thought.A situation where he alone had to deal with 8 men with weapons with just his bare hands.No matter how strong Simon was, the number of people he had to face was honestly a bit too much.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Father. Getting to Kizen might take longer.\u2019Simon lowered his stance with a serious expression, and the gang members also tensed and strengthened their grips on their daggers.A volatile situation.The moment when the fight was about to start, no matter who pounced in.\u201cI found you!\u201dThe voice of a third person, who shouldn\u2019t have been in this alley, echoed. Everyone\u2019s eyes moved to the place where the sound was coming from.Step. Step.Someone was walking out of the dark shade of the alley.It was a girl who still had a youthful look. Shiny black hair, as if she had painted the night sky, and wore a blood-red moon-shaped earring.Simon thought she was around his age or several years older than him.And what the hell was that now?Rowley bit his lip at the third person\u2019s appearance.What was the guy watching his back doing? He couldn\u2019t even see where they had gone.\u201c\u2026It has nothing to do with you. Get lost.\u201dDespite Rowley\u2019s warning, the black-haired girl snorted scornfully.As she got closer, the gang members took a step back, a tense expression on their faces.An instinctive and primitive sense of fear. They didn\u2019t know the exact reason, but the girl had a very dangerous aura.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201dRowley said as the gang members were shaken up.\u201cIt\u2019s 8 vs 2. We just need to get rid of them quickly and leave Langerstine before the guards arrive.\u201dHearing that, the girl smiled.\u201c8 vs 2? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dUp and down.As if reacting to the girl\u2019s movements, the garbage dumps and bags scattered all over the alley started moving like they were alive. Soon after, the trash bags\u2019 surfaces were torn and bones floated in the air.\u201cDid you guys know?\u201dRattle. Click.The bones began to put themselves together. Different sizes and types of bones creaked and slowly formed a body.\u201cThat the building in front of you is a skeleton tomb.\u201dRowley and his comrades\u2019 faces turned white.At this moment, the same word popped into everyone\u2019s mind simultaneously.\u2018\u2026\u2026Necromancer!\u2019Rattle! Rattle!Over 20 skeletons surrounded these gangs in an instant. Petrified, the gang members couldn\u2019t even breathe.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cKuhugh!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe approaching undead grabbed the gang members with their arms and legs to prevent them from moving.With a crackling sound, the dead swept the gang\u2019s faces down or held them up by their chins with their boneless hands.\u201cOh my goodness.\u201dThe girl let out an alluring smile.\u201cMy children need new friends, apparently.\u201dChatter!Chatter!The skeletons made a sound by clashing their top and bottom jaws in agreement. Some gangsters foamed their mouths, and others wet their pants.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dSimon was surprised too. It was less complete than Richard\u2019s skeletons, but it was a great feat to create more than 20 instant undead by restoring the remains of the bones lying around.\u201cI failed to recognize that you\u2019re a necromancer! Please have mercy just once!\u201dRowley lowered his head while trembling. The girl unfolded her arms and asked him with a slightly serious expression,\u201cTell me your affiliation.\u201dThe skeleton that grabbed Rowley started to scratch his neck slowly with its bony hand. Rowley screamed with his eyes shut as five drops of blood flowed down his neck.\u201cIt\u2019s Claven! We\u2019re from the Claven group!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard of it. That\u2019s a pretty big organization for the pickpocketing of poor outsiders.\u201dShe put her hand on her waist and said in an ice-cold voice,\u201cTell him directly. Crawl and go to the guards in the form of voluntary appearance with his head on the floor and hands on his back, crawling the moment he leaves the hideout.\u201dHearing that, Rowley\u2019s face turned white.\u201cP-Please have mercy\u2026! Just turn me into an undead instead!The girl\u2019s face contorted fiercely.[ Are you the one giving orders now? ]Rowley\u2019s body stiffened with fear at the sound of a foreign voice that sounded as if it were uttered by an inhumane existence.She let out a small sigh, returned to her original voice and said,\u201cPulling off petty tricks like sending a fake won\u2019t work. If that bastard\u2019s face isn\u2019t grinded enough when I check, then I\u2019ll erase your entire organization from the world in the name of Kizen.\u201dThe moment the name Kizen dropped from her mouth, all the organization members dropped their heads in shock. Rowley also responded as if he had accepted his fate.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll make sure to remember that.\u201d\u201cGet lost.\u201dAs the skeletons stepped back, the gang fled away, as if on cue. She clicked her tongue once, looking at them running as fast as they could.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201dSimon bowed his head in gratitude. The girl turned her head, saying \u201cAh,\u201d and looked at Simon.\u201cYou\u2019re Simon Polentia, right?\u201dFortunately, there was no sign of hostility in her tone of voice when she asked that with a smile. Simon nodded his head quickly.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, who are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho else would I be? I\u2019m your real guide.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened to the size of a lantern.So, this was the one?At that moment, she grabbed Simon\u2019s wrist.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Mother\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Mother?\u201d* * *\u201cMotheeerr!\u201dBehind the square of Langerstine,The girl who had brought Simon was squatting and wiping the cream off a child\u2019s mouth.The child made a \u2018Ooof\u2019 sound and moved her head like she hated it, but the girl was skillful.\u201cI told you to wait patiently! You always get lost!\u201d\u201cBuuut! Theeere was a free ice cream tasting event in the square over there!\u201dAnd the identity of the child whining while her mouth was wiped clean by the girl was none other than Nefthis Archbold, the apex of all necromancers and ruler of Kizen.To see a person called the Witch of Death with ice cream all over her mouth\u2026\u2026 Simon was very confused.And what was even more confusing was that the girl who saved him was calling Nefthis, \u2018Mother\u2019.The two of them were in a mother-daughter relationship? No matter how you looked at it, it only looked like an older and a younger sister.And if you had to choose the mother, it would be that girl rather than Nefthis, who looked like a 10-year-old child\u2026\u2026\u201cSimon?\u201dBefore he realized, the girl was looking his way.\u201cWere you thinking of something funny just now?\u201d\u201cN-No.\u201dThe girl, who had been glaring at Simon with suspicious eyes, quickly turned her head away.\u2026\u2026What a strong intuition.\u201cGood work on your long trip, Simon!\u201d Nefthis approached with quick short steps.Although she had the appearance of an innocent child, her identity was of a monster among monsters who had lived for over 300 years and terrorized the world.Simon bowed politely.\u201cI\u2019m humbly meeting the owner of the Kizen.\u201d\u201cWoah, you don\u2019t have to be so formal.\u201dShe giggled and waved her hand.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you since Les Hill. Did you learn anything from Richard?\u201d\u201cAh, yes! It\u2019s just a little, but\u2026\u201dSimon spread out his palm. He activated the core and flowed mana in to draw out the jet-black.The jet-black passed through Simon\u2019s arm and was immediately released there.Swoosh.Simon\u2019s unique jet-black with a slight blue tint surged like a fire.Nefthis and the girl came forward simultaneously and widened their eyes. Looking at them like this, it seemed that their mother-daughter relationship could be right.\u201cWow.\u201dBoth of their pairs of eyes lit up. They gazed like they were appreciating a beautiful work of art.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I saw a jet-black with a blueish color.\u201d\u201cBut it still has the properties of mana. To see it surging like fire means that it hasn\u2019t been able to get out of the gaseous state.\u201d\u201cHe needs to learn to use his core more effectively.\u201dThe mother and daughter exchanged their opinions briefly and then nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Simon.\u201dSimon released the jet-black and stood up straight.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be impatient. Since Kizen is clearly a school, you\u2019ll be able to learn a lot more in the future.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll keep that in mind!\u201d\u201cWell then. Lorain?\u201dNefthis slapped the girl\u2019s butt and said,\u201cI\u2019m counting on you as the guide for our new student.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You always use me like this, mother.\u201dThe girl pouted her lips and said sullen words, but Nefthis didn\u2019t even listen and turned her back.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll return to Kizen after eating one more ice cream. So, I\u2019ll be going on ahead!\u201d\u201cAh, for crying out loud! Mother!\u201dIn that way, Nefthis disappeared like she was running away, leaving only the two of them in the square.The girl let out a small sigh and turned her head to look at Simon.\u201cI guess I can\u2019t help it. Well, I\u2019ll introduce myself again. My name is Lorain Archbold. Just like you, I\u2019m a student from Kizen.\u201d\u201cMy name is Simon Polentia, from Les Hill! Nice to meet you again!\u201d\u201cOkay. Since we\u2019re running late, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cGet going for what?\u201dLorain replied as she brushed her hair back.\u201cIt\u2019s the new semester, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re going shopping.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySimon and Lorain returned to Kemmelroad.It turned out that Kemmelroad was a street dealing with items for Necromancers.The deeper you went, the more revealing the types of items on display became, such as skeletons, monster corpses, and organs that moved as if they were alive and were sold in liquid bottles.Simon felt as if he had entered a different world separated from the world that he had originally lived in.\u201cDo you know when the most exciting time of the entire school life is?\u201dAsked Lorain, who was walking with him side by side.\u201cUh, hm\u2026 When?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s when you\u2019re shopping for school uniforms, textbooks, and supplies with excitement before enrolling in school! Now is your happiest time, so enjoy, Simon.\u201dShe chuckled a little.\u201cThings will be really hectic after getting into Kizen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dThe first place they went to was the bookstore.Kizen\u2019s admission and tuition fees were all free, but textbooks had to be purchased as personal expenses.\u201cThere are a lot of books to buy. Do you still have the admission letter?\u201d\u201cYes! Here it is.\u201dBesides the admission letter, there was a list of necessary materials in the letter.Lorain glanced at only the pages on the list of books and returned the letter before saying,\u201cI remembered everything. This way.\u201dWhile Simon was following her from behind, something heavy suddenly dropped.Simon quickly stretched out his arms to catch it. It was a terribly thick book. On the cover, he could see the title, <Introduction to Summoning \u2013 by Elricmoore Trinble>\u2018Introduction to Summoning?\u2019Before Simon could think of anything, another new book was put on top. This time, it was <Introduction to Necromancy>.\u2018T-This one\u2019s heavy too!\u2019Lorain kept pulling books from the bookshelves and stacked them up.The books <Introduction to Curses>, <Introduction to Hemomancy>, <Introduction to Defense Against the Holy Arts>, and <Introduction to Combat Magic> were piled up. Simon\u2019s arms started to tremble.\u201cLorain! Don\u2019t tell me we have to learn all of this in the first year, do we?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dShe gave a fresh smile while turning around.\u201cWe\u2019re in Kizen, you know? It\u2019s a given to master this much in the 1st semester of 1st year.\u201d\u201cHere, take this \u2018Poisonous Alchemy\u2019 book too!\u201d\u2026\u2026I think I miss Les Hill already.She ran to find the book, <Introduction to the Epidemiology of Jet-Black> while frantically choosing a book.Left alone for a moment, Simon looked around.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019Most of the people who entered the bookstore were around his age.Judging from them holding the <Introduction to Summoning> or <Introduction to Necromancy> books, they must\u2019ve been students enrolling at Kizen.It was the first time he had seen so many of his peers in one place. At Les Hill, the only people he knew at his age were Carlon, who was one year older, and Sofia, who was two years younger.A new life with students of the same age. Little by little, Simon began to look forward to this thing called school life.\u201cYes! I\u2019m on my way!\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhile he was side-tracked, a female student was running by his side. Simon narrowed his eyes and observed her movements.In an instant, her body bent towards Simon.\u2018What?\u2019There was no reason for him to bump into her, so Simon turned his body to dodge her.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dShe hit the bookshelf just like that, and the books stacked on the bookshelf shook precariously.This was dangerous.Simon instinctively jumped to her and covered her.Rrruuumble!Books fell on Simon\u2019s back.It hurt a lot. The books felt like stones stabbing him.She looked up at Simon with an astonished face, and then bowed her head hurriedly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry! Because of me\u2014!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry for spacing out and getting in the way.\u201dSimon said while trying his best to smile.\u201cRather than that, let\u2019s put these back up. I think we\u2019re going to get scolded.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dThe two hurriedly picked up the fallen books. She handed up the books on the floor, and Simon tiptoed and placed them on the bookshelf.One of the clerks heard the noise and came to see what was going on, but when he saw the two of them putting the books back, luckily, he went back without saying anything.\u2018This is the last one.\u2019While Simon was putting the last book back where it was, the girl was organizing Simon\u2019s books that were scattered around.\u201cY-You\u2019re a freshman of Kizen, right?\u201dLooks like she saw the textbooks.Her face broke into a wide smile when Simon nodded.\u201cI-I\u2019m a freshman of Kizen too! My name is Cindy Vivace! What about you?\u201d\u201cSimon Polentia.\u201d\u201cI see. Nice to meet you! I\u2019m actually from Shahed, in the north, so I was a little scared because I didn\u2019t have any close friends here.\u201dSimon nodded his head.\u201cI guess we\u2019re in a similar situation.\u201d\u201cI-If it\u2019s alright with you, Simon\u2026\u2026\u201dWith her face dyed red, Cindy twiddled the tips of her two index fingers. Then she said in a scarcely audible voice,\u201cDo you mind\u2026 if I talked to you at school\u2026 in the future?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.Simon gave a little smile.\u201cOf course. I\u2019d like to ask you of something first though.\u201d\u201cThanks!\u201dShe jumped up from her seat.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going! Father\u2019s waiting for me outside.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cSee you in Kizen next time!\u201dShe waved her hand and walked away.\u201cWait a minute. Cindy?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dShe looked back. Simon was shaking something.\u201cCould you return my wallet now?\u201dIn Simon\u2019s hand was Cindy\u2019s wallet.In that instant, her eyes that only seemed innocent turned sharp. The pupils of her eyes split vertically like a cat\u2019s.\u2018No way.\u2019Cindy quickly rummaged through her pockets. They were empty.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Hah.\u201dShe was completely beaten.She raised the corner of her lips and looked back at Simon.\u201cI was confident that you would never find it out because I swiped it with Necromantic magic, but how did you know?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that, my wallet started floating all of a sudden, so\u2026\u201dCindy strode over and made eye contact with Simon.\u201cAnd you simply noticed that? Don\u2019t give me bullshit. You\u2019re also applying to major Necromancy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not yet sure abo\u2014\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201dCindy\u2019s eyes sparkled up.\u201cKizen is on a whole different level after all! Wow! My gosh! People like you would be swarming there, right? Ah, I\u2019m really looking forward to school life!\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you too confident for a pick-pocket?\u2019She chuckled before taking Simon\u2019s wallet out from an inner pocket and throwing it to him.\u201cIf you\u2019re also majoring in Necromancy, we might see each other for 3 years, right? Let\u2019s compete to the death, Simon!\u201dShe was the type of person who didn\u2019t really listen to people.Simon gave a little sigh and tried to return her wallet, but Cindy waved her hand this time.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I lost this time, so take that as a payment for victory.\u201dBeing cool in a weird situation.Simon thought that the myth that there are no normal people among the Necromancers was slowly coming true.\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to meeting you. Say hi if you see me at school!\u201dCindy walked and disappeared through the bookstore wall while waving.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019It felt like a storm had passed. Simon, who had been staring blankly at the wall where Cindy had disappeared, opened her wallet.There were only a few coins in it.\u2018Making a big deal out of it.\u2019Simon giggled.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cSimon!\u201dAt that moment, Lorain returned with her black hair waving.\u201c \u2018Introduction to the Epidemiology of Jet-Black\u2019 seems to be sold out now! The stock will arrive in two hours, so they said they would deliver it to the dorm along with the other books.\u201dLorain poked Simon\u2019s arm mischievously.\u201cBy the way, who was that girl a while ago? Are you close with her already?\u201dSimon sweated and avoided her gaze.\u201c\u2026W-Well, something like that.\u201d\u201cFufu. Why are you stuttering? Don\u2019t tell me you guys already exchanged your feelings?\u201dWell, we almost exchanged our wallets.\u201cAnyways. Since we decided to get the books delivered, let\u2019s get out. There are many other places to stop by other than here.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going next?\u201d\u201cA shop for bags.\u201dDo I have to buy a new bag too?\u201cWhat I\u2019m using right now isn\u2019t that bad though.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dNot understanding what he was saying, she blinked her eyes, and then\u2026\u201cAhaha!\u201dBurst out in loud laughter.\u201cAh. So cute. So you\u2019re really a bumpkin, huh?\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dSimon\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment.\u201cWhen we say bag for Necromancers, it usually means a \u2018Magical Inventory.\u2019 To put it simply, a subspace.\u201d* * *A large building set a few blocks away from the bookstore.Simon and Lorain were led downstairs. After going through several layers of dark security magic, the two were able to enter the shop lit up with soft lighting in the underground.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Wow.\u201dThis entire space was lined with items such as backpacks, pockets, and briefcases.Long coats, pocket watches. Even carts and living lizards.Things you wouldn\u2019t know what they were for were hanging on the wall or floating in the air through magic.\u201cWelcome, young lady Lorain!\u201dAn old woman in a luxurious mink coat appeared from the stairs.She had a thin body and a fastidious impression. Expensive gold crafts were hung all over her body.Lorain happily waved her hand.\u201cHave you been doing well, Stephanie?\u201dStephanie laughed while rubbing her hands.\u201cI wonder why our VVIP visited us without any notice? I\u2019m sure you bought a bag last month\u2026\u2026\u201dLorain gently placed her hand on Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI came to see this friend\u2019s bag today.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dStephanie suddenly appeared in front of Simon. Simon had to pull his head back slightly because of the hooked nose of the old woman that burst in.\u201cSo you\u2019re a freshman of Kizen! A pleasure to meet you! Necromancers are always our best customers.\u201d\u201cA-A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\u201cThen, what kind of product shall I show you?\u201dLorain answered instead.\u201cThe best and most expensive.\u201d\u201cUnbelievable!\u201dScreamed Stephanie.\u201cBoth VVIPs! I\u2019ll take you this way.\u201dStephanie brought the two of them into another room. The products were not hung on the wall, but stored in glass display cases. Stephanie tapped one of the shelves with her finger, and the window vanished as if it had evaporated.\u201cTry this, dear customer.\u201dWhat she handed over was a navy-blue glove featured with luxurious patterns.As Simon carefully put it on his right hand, he felt the expensive cushioning. It was enough to make him almost faint.\u201cThis product was created by \u2018Ellen Beiter\u2019, the subspace craftsman of the century. Could you please draw a rectangle with your finger on any wall?\u201dSimon nodded and drew a square on the wall as instructed.Shiing!Then a hole was opened up in the wall.When Simon looked inside in surprise, a huge space had spread out. It was big enough to fit an entire house.\u2018So, this is a subspace!\u2019While Simon\u2019s thoughts were filled with astonishment, Stephanie\u2019s explanation continued.\u201cAs expected from the masterpiece of Ellen Beiter, the loading capacity is a whopping 8,000UB! In addition, there\u2019s the convenience of bringing up the space at any time if you\u2019re wearing gloves! It\u2019s truly a product worth calling an innovation of inventories!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dOn the other hand, Lorain looked quite disappointed.\u201cIt does look convenient, but only being able to open a subspace when a wall exists is a strict limitation. There are many cases where there aren\u2019t any in battles on plains. And Simon is now a beginner as a necromancer, so he doesn\u2019t need a large capacity either.\u201d\u201cThat might be one way to say it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there something that\u2019s more versatile, even if the capacity is smaller?\u201dStephanie walked away with a grin instead of answering. Then, she removed the glass window of the display stand at the far end.\u201cThis is a product that hasn\u2019t yet been released to the market. The latest work of Eclipse, one of the next generation of young artisans!\u201dWhat she carefully lifted up was a ring. It was basically silver, but it changed to purple or green depending on the angle of the light.\u201cTry equipping it, dear customer.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dSimon carefully put on the ring. The soft prism\u2019s color was beautiful.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to use! Please flow jet-black into the ring.\u201dSimon moved his jet-black as instructed.The ring absorbed the jet-black like a sponge and changed its color from silver to dark blue.\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026It feels like something like a handle is under the ring.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s working properly! Think of it as a lever and pull it out.\u201dSimon grabbed the imaginary handle and pulled it back slowly.And then\u2026Rattle!With the sound of the stones interlocking each other,A vertical space opened on the floor. Something like white vapor flowed out from the gap in the space.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Woah!\u201dSimon\u2019s heart began to pound rapidly. This time, even Lorain had a slightly surprised expression on her face.\u201cThe loading capacity is 4,000UB, which is half of the product a while ago, but it\u2019s far superior in terms of practical usage! This subspace opens on the floor regardless of its slopes or uneven surfaces. There are 7 magics enchanted inside the space, including first-class preservation magic and temperature control magic.\u201d\u201cWhat about an eject function?\u201dAsked Lorain.\u201cOf course, there is! You may try it.\u201dStephanie was looking around for a suitable item when she found a little bunny doll lying in a corner.\u201cHm? Why is a doll here?\u201d\u201cMy playful granddaughter often visits the store.\u201dStephanie let out a bitter laugh and threw the doll into the subspace.\u201cDear customer, you\u2019re a freshman, right? To use the eject function in actual fights, you\u2019ll have to practice a lot. Now, feel like you\u2019re using the space\u2019s mana to wrap around it and\u2026\u201dAs Simon was told, he moved his mana to cover the rabbit doll.It wasn\u2019t difficult. Maybe because the ring was in contact with the body, the mana of the subspace moved freely, like the mana of his own body.\u201c\u2026Mana automatically activates the ejection magic inside the space just by surrounding it. Now, if you release the mana that was wrapping the object like popping it\u2026!\u201dPow!The rabbit doll came out of the subspace. It floated up in a gentle arc and fell on the floor while standing upright.Stephanie and Lorain exclaimed.\u201cWell done, dear customer!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good! Are you sure this is your first time?\u201dHis heart was racing, so he couldn\u2019t hear the two of them well. He seemed to understand why subspace was an essential item for a necromancer.Simon thought of himself opening a subspace in the near future and taking out the undead.\u201cSimon. Do you like it?\u201dLorain came close and smiled. Simon snapped out of it and nodded his head repeatedly.Of course he liked it. It was the first time he\u2019d ever wanted something this much.However\u2026Simon\u2019s eyes slowly turned to Stephanie.\u201c\u2026How much is this subspace?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stephanie made a bright smile with her lips, and the two began to move to checkout.\u201cWait!\u201dSimon exclaimed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cY-You don\u2019t have to do this! It\u2019s 5,000 gold! I can\u2019t receive such a huge gift like this!\u201dLorain tilted her head.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear from my mother? She\u2019s paying for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Nefthis?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure she said\u2026\u201dLorain put her hand to her lips and got lost in her thoughts for a while.\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, but my mother owes a lot to your parents, apparently. She said that, since they\u2019ve already come to an understanding, you don\u2019t have to feel burdened.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, after arguing about the payment for a while, Simon decided to receive the subspace.\u201cThank you, dear customer and young lady! Please visit us again next time!\u201dAt the back of Simon and Lorain leaving the store, Stephanie and the staff bowed their heads.Again, outside in the sun,Simon gazed at the gleaming ring between his fingers as if he were charmed by it.\u2018I can\u2019t believe this is mine.\u2019He was so happy that he couldn\u2019t hold back his expression.\u201cAre you that happy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dSimon let out an awkward laugh.\u201cI really owe Nefthis a huge one. I wonder how I can repay her\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. However, if there\u2019s one thing my mother wants, I think it\u2019s you keeping up with life in Kizen well.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll really do my best!\u201dAfter that, shopping with Loraine continued.In addition to future necessities such as pens, notebooks, and lights, he also purchased a skeleton set and materials for potion crafting, placing them in the subspace.According to Lorain, you could also buy the ingredients in the annexed town in front of Kizen, but it looked like it was much more expensive there.\u201cSimon! Let us go play that too!\u201d\u201c\u2026Is playing darts a part of prepping for school?\u201d\u201cJust having fun!\u201dWe sometimes strayed somewhere else\u2026 but she was an excellent guide nonetheless.\u201cThen I\u2019ll light it up.\u201d\u201cYes! Now\u2019s the time!\u201dAt the viewing tower of Langerstine, when Simon and Lorain released their hands simultaneously, the lantern flew towards the night sky.People around them were also flying their lanterns. The night sky was dyed with an enchanting scarlet red, and a beautiful party of lights stretched out.The people caught up in the mood gave cheers or clapped their hands, and couples began to kiss as if on cue.\u201cThis place is the Langerstine\u2019s must-see attraction, the Thousand Lights.\u201dLorain put her hands on her waist and smiled confidently.\u201cWhat do you think, Simon?\u201d\u201cCan I be honest?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSimon answered without taking his eyes off the lights that lit up the night sky.\u201cI\u2019m just pondering that there are thousands of stupid people who spend 200 silver on burning oil paper\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe gave a cold gaze.\u201cYou\u2019ll adjust really well in Kizen.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll also do my be\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a compliment!\u201dThe last place the two went was a restaurant with a good atmosphere overlooking the sea.Luxurious chandeliers hung on the ceiling, the tableware sparkled, and there were even waiters in ties and uniforms.It was the first time Simon ate in a restaurant like this.Needless to say, the food was delicious. The moment when the glossy steak entered his mouth, his body trembled with an indescribable sense of joy.In addition, when you turned your head, the picturesque night-sea spread out, and you could hear the sound of waves crashing in your ear. It was indeed just about a perfect place.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at handling difficult tablewares too, huh? A noble is noble after all.\u201dLorain rested her chin with her hand and laughed.\u201cBecause my father was strict with etiquette.\u201d\u201cYou learned it well. Ah! I\u2019m saying this just in case, but when you get in Kizen, about 30% of them are commoners, you see?\u201dShe continued to speak as she wiped her lips with the napkin.\u201cSo you shouldn\u2019t put people down with your status. Kizen\u2019s school tradition is an unconditional meritocracy. Even the daughter of a duke bows their head to a commoner of a higher grade. Just think of everyone in the first year as an equal.\u201dSimon said he would mark her words and nodded his head. In Les Hill, people harmonized well regardless of their status, so he wasn\u2019t worried about it.\u201cThe entrance ceremony will be held tomorrow. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u2026 Ah! This morning, I met an incoming freshman like me, and she talked about a major.\u201d\u201cA major? That\u2019s a good question.\u201dLorain smiled and continued to speak.\u201cIn the 1st semester of the 1st year, there are nine subjects, you know? From the 2nd semester, you can choose the class you want to take, and you\u2019ll have to choose a major when you go up to the 2nd year.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019d have to figure out what subjects I\u2019m good at quickly.\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201dShe spun the fork, and her eyes gleamed like a strategist.\u201cEven in the 1st semester, it\u2019s better to decide in advance the main subject that you\u2019re good at and study mainly in that area since people who\u2019re distinct with their main subjects are popular when group classes are conducted.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll definitely remember that.\u201d\u201cDo you perhaps have a major in your mind?\u201dSimon remembered what happened in the morning for a moment. The scene where the bone fragments from the garbage pile were put together and turned into an undead.It was so impressive that it was ingrained deeply in his mind.\u201c\u2026I think I\u2019m a little bit interested in studying Summoning.\u201d\u201cSummoning is good! So, you\u2019re planning to walk the path of the orthodox.\u201dLorain told stories of the different subjects, and Simon listened, his eyes shining.He could communicate with her well. Of course, Simon was the one who usually listened, but she also appreciated Simon\u2019s attitude, as he was eagerly attentive when she was speaking.Even after dinner, as if they felt lacking, the two of them talked at a nearby pub until the 2nd and 3rd round.And it was Simon\u2019s first time drinking.He was hesitant at first because he was a minor, but Lorain said that drinking alcohol was allowed for Kizen students. However, since the next day was the entrance ceremony, they only drank to be in a good mood.The talk got long, and Simon arrived at the inn just after midnight.\u201cThank you for bringing me home, Lorain\u201d\u201cNah. This much is nothing.\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon blushed and scratched his head.\u201cI should be the one taking you home, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dLorain blinked, wondering what Simon said, then let out a peculiar smile.\u201cSo you were aware of it, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ahem.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just accept the gesture. Langerstine is a complicated city. You won\u2019t be able to take me home, let alone get back here by yourself.He couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cGo in and get some rest. If my mother hears that you were late because of drinking, she\u2019ll beat me to death.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you for today! I really enjoyed it.\u201dSimon bowed his head and thanked her.Actually, it wasn\u2019t just enjoyable. Simon seemed like he could never forget his first day at Langerstine.Lorain, waving her hand while walking away, suddenly stopped and turned back to Simon.\u201cAh! Simon, I have one confession to make.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLorain ran her hand through her hair while being unusually shy.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to deceive you, but somehow I couldn\u2019t find the right timing to tell you. Uhm\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen their eyes met, she cutely crinkled her eyes.\u201cActually, I\u2019m a 1st-year freshman too!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Wait, what?\u201d\u201cSo the next time we meet at school, just talk casually. Bye!\u201dShe waved her hand and disappeared into the darkness.Dumbfounded, Simon, looking at the place where she disappeared, giggled and entered the inn.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The morning had come.Lorain told him to get a good night\u2019s sleep, but because of the excitement and expectation of a new life Simon couldn\u2019t sleep well. He got up early, got ready, and left the inn.Lorain was supposed to go to Kizen by a different route, so Simon had to go to the meeting point alone.Of course, he clearly remembered the meeting place.The spot seen from the restaurant he went to with Lorain yesterday. The pointy-shaped land that protruded towards the sea.As he got closer to the meeting point, more and more people were on the side of the road. Most of them looked the same age as Simon, but they all looked unique.A fairy girl was fixing her makeup while walking. A male student wore 20 swords as if his entire body was an inventory. A female student strolled with a large case bigger than her on her back.\u2018As expected. I\u2019m the normalest one here.\u2019Simon walked while thinking that, but in fact, everyone here had the same thought.He soon arrived at the meeting point. Dispatched \u2018Servants of Kizen\u2019 were restricting the surroundings, and a boat was anchored at the end of the protruding terrain.Maybe they were getting into Kizen with that.\u201cPlease hurry up. We\u2019ll be departing to Kizen soon!\u201dSimon also waited in line to board the boat. The unique part was that the hull faced the ground rather than the sea. He couldn\u2019t figure out why the boat was placed that way.\u201cPlease present your proof of admission.\u201dNow it was Simon\u2019s turn. He handed the servant the letter he had prepared in advance.The servant checked the letter and the list in hand, ticked it with a quill, and returned it.\u201cSimon Polentia. You\u2019re registered.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWhen Simon, who passed through safely, was about to get on board\u2026\u201cThere must be some kind of mistake!\u201dA violent complaint was heard from the next row.\u201cI\u2019m the 1st candidate for substitution, and not even a single one is backing out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Lucius isn\u2019t on the admissions list.\u201d\u201cFucking shit. Are you really going to do your jobs like this? Contact Kizen! There must be something wrong!\u201dA small commotion happened by the side. Some students whispered while getting on the boat.\u201cIt\u2019s an annual event, apparently.\u201d\u201cThere are always some people who can\u2019t accept the results.\u201d\u201c1st candidate? I do feel a little bad about him. Ahem.\u201dThe students boarded the boat while sneering.Wham!A problem broke out in the end. Out of agitation, Lucius knocked over the servant, letting them fall to the floor.\u201cI\u2019m Lucius Carol, heir to the count of Dresden! This is an order. Contact the headquarters of Kizen right now!\u201d\u201cPlease return. Lucius isn\u2019t on the admissions list.\u201dThe servant repeated the exact words in a firm tone. Purple with rage, Lucius finally grabbed the servant\u2019s hair.Clamor.The atmosphere became harsher. The students also stopped walking and looked at this scene, and some even pulled up jet-black.The moment when Lucius, bloodshot in his eyes, raised his right arm\u2026Grab.\u201cPlease stop it.\u201dLucius turned his head. Simon had already turned around and grabbed his arm.\u201cWho the hell are you? Let me go!\u201dSimon smiled and strengthened his grip.Crack!\u201cAaaagh!\u201dWith the unbelievable grip strength, Lucius screamed and twisted his body.It was impossible for a noble boy to handle the power of Simon, who had been training for a long time by working in his territory.Press. Press.His body gradually went down, and then he fell to the floor on one knee.In the end, the strength in his left hand , the one holding the servant\u2019s hair, was released, and Simon also released Lucius\u2019 right hand.\u201cWho the fuck are you?! Do you wanna die?\u201dShiing!He even drew the sword on his waist because Simon didn\u2019t answer.The whispers grew louder, and the situation grew more and more tense.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dIt was then.A man approached from the boat.His face was pale, like a patient battling a disease. His cheeks were hollow, hands yellow, and he had premature gray hairs on his head.The students who saw him made a hushed admiration.\u201cI-It\u2019s professor Silage!\u201d\u201c\u2026Silage is part of the teaching staff?! Kizen is Kizen after all\u2026\u201dAs he approached, even Lucius, who had been triumphant, staggered and stepped back.Silage moved his gaze slowly.One of the servants lay on the floor with his hair messed up. A student who jumped in to stop someone. And a noble who was shouting that he\u2019s the 1st candidate.Silage looked at Lucius with a flinty stare.\u201cAny last words?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you really think you people can treat me like th\u2014!\u201dPoof.And Lucius\u2019 body disappeared from the world.A few drops of liquid, assumed to be blood, fell to the floor.Just like that.Everyone was open mouthed and blinked their eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no time. All of you freshmen, board the boat.\u201dSaid Silage while folding his hands behind his back and turning around.\u201cYou too.\u201dSimon silently nodded and moved to the boat.Due to what just happened, the atmosphere of the incoming students was silent as a grave. However, some students couldn\u2019t hide their excitement and whispered among themselves.\u201cSo that\u2019s dark blood magic!\u2019\u201d\u201cI almost faltered even though I\u2019m planning to apply for curse studies.\u201d\u201c1st years can also attend that professor\u2019s class, right?\u201dAs Simon walked towards the boat, he glanced at Silage.Silage was also looking at Simon.When their eyes met, he smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, yes.\u201dWhen Simon got on the boat, Silage said,\u201cEveryone, fasten your seat belts.\u201dSilage waved his hand in the air.A reddish bubble spread out and covered the entire boat. Simon observed the situation with curiosity.\u2018How are we getting to Kizen with this boat?\u2019The bow pointed towards the shore, not to the sea. Simon wondered if they\u2019re planning to make a sternway, but the communicating servant made a report to Silage.\u201cProfessor, it\u2019ll arrive in 5 minutes.\u201d\u201cLure it as is.\u201dThe voices of the students grew louder. A huge spray of water was coming to them from the far horizon.Swooooooosh!The spray approached, inflating its size more and more, and after a while, a huge, indescribable whale appeared.\u201cWhoaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe whale opened its mouth, swallowed the boat, and went into the sea.* * *An underwater undead called the \u2018Nether Whale\u2019 that followed Kizen\u2019s orders.It was a monster that roamed the oceans of the world and devoured the ports of cities designated by Kizen.But only once a year. It also played the role of transferring new students of Kizen who had not received teleport permission to the school. To put it more simply, it was Kizen\u2019s high-speed \u2018transportation method\u2019.Although it was inside a whale, it was quite warm and comfortable. Kizen\u2019s servants who resided in the whale came to the boat to provide food and services to the students.The mood soon relaxed, and everyone started to laugh and talk about their future life.\u201cYou were so cool before.\u201dSimon was also talking with the student sitting next to him.The boy with green hair and his forehead exposed introduced himself as \u2018Rowen Oscar\u2019. He was so outgoing that he had already made friends with several people before coming to Simon.\u201cI mean, it\u2019s true! It was an atmosphere in which you couldn\u2019t simply just take action, but you jumped in, and his wrist went crack!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201dSimon shrugged it off and sliced the fish steak. The steak was gently cut, and he sprinkled lemon juice on it.While Rowen was mainly talking and Simon listened with a nod of his head, Rowen clapped his hands together and asked Simon a question.\u201cBy the way, what kind of exam did you take for the entrance exam?\u201d\u201cEntrance test?\u201dSimon tilted his head at the phrase he had heard for the first time.\u201cWas there something like that?\u201d\u201cOf course! Anyone who wants to enroll in Kizen must take one! In my case, I did a shape change of jet-black\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Rowen naturally moved on to his own story, Simon was immersed in doubt.A test? He had no memory of doing such a thing at all.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it cause trouble regarding fairness if I talk about my case carelessly?\u2019After finishing the heroic story full of exaggeration, Rowen asked with sparkling eyes,\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cUh, um\u2026 Mine was like yours. Changing the shape of jet-black.\u201d\u201cOh! What a coincidence!\u201d\u201cEveryone, take your seats. We\u2019ll be arriving soon.\u201dSilage\u2019s voice was heard. The students who had been chatting quickly returned to their seats.It seemed like it hadn\u2019t been long since the departure, but being told that they\u2019re arriving soon, the tension rushed in. Simon fastened his seat belt and adjusted his clothes.Silage came up on the deck, spread a reddish substance like a while ago, and covered the boat. Then the whale\u2019s belly began to fill with water.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to fall, hold on tight.\u201dSilage had a grim smile on his face as he said that, so Simon grabbed the handle in front of him as hard as he could.Swaaaaaaaaaaaa!As if a clogged dam was torn open, the water that filled up spurted out with great force. The screams of the students echoed from going at the speed where their legs were floating.A bright light was seen at the end of the tunnel in the hole where it was pitch black and the boat slipped out in an instant.Whiiish!They flew out.Thousands of meters above the sky, where the ground looked like a toy.The boat was aboard a stream of water spewed out by the nether whale.Shortly after, the power of the water gradually weakened and the bow turned downward. The students screamed in horror.Now, they\u2019d fall.\u201cKugh!\u201dSimon hugged the seat in front of him.Soon, the surroundings passed like a beam of light and they plummeted endlessly. The hem of Simon\u2019s clothes fluttered like crazy in the wind.Slice.At that moment, Silage cut his index finger with his fingernail. A drop of blood that spilled out was absorbed by the surface covering the boat, and the falling speed slowed little by little.When Simon carefully opened his eyes after a while, the boat was slowly descending like a hot air balloon.\u201cWhoaaaa\u2026!\u201dThe students were astonished.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The sun, which dyed the world in orange light over the blue horizon, presented a truly fantastic sunrise. Under the boat, the scenery of \u2018Roke island\u2019, where Kizen was located, drew attention.From lush jungles, to slick wilderness, to waterfalls with fallen leaves, to snow-capped mountains. You could look down at the four seasons at once on this island.\u201cRowen! Wake up!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, most of them, including Rowen, still had their heads shoved into the seats or were dry heaving.The boat finally landed safely on the ground after slowly landing as if it had opened a parachute.Sighs of relief could be heard from everywhere. Many students immediately covered their mouths and ran to the trees to vomit.\u201cCome out and stand in 4 columns.\u201dAfter a quick headcount, Silage moved his students.Kizen was a large castle that was difficult to estimate the size of. The giant gatekeeper opened the gates and they entered through several layers of dark security magic.Some students arrived through other routes besides Simon\u2019s party who had ridden the Nether Whale. Judging from their exhausted faces, it looked like they also had a \u2018dynamic\u2019 trip.\u201cWe\u2019ll fasten up the pace a little. Please come this way!\u201dUpon entering the castle, the servants that were waiting quickly guided them. The students went straight to a nearby building, were provided with uniforms, and then moved to the changing rooms, divided by men and women, to change their clothes.\u201cPlease finish changing clothes within 5 minutes and assemble outside.\u201dEverything was quick in this place. Simon quickly changed into the school uniform as he was swept away by the atmosphere.\u2018Even the uniform looks cool in Kizen.\u2019The seemingly tailor-fit stylish black pants were more like a suit than a school uniform. Even if it was clinging, moving wasn\u2019t uncomfortable in the slightest.He also wore a white dress shirt, red-tone tie and finally a stylish jacket with Kizen\u2019s insignia on it.He then walked up to the mirror.\u2018Wow.\u2019So this is how I look with a suit on.The appearance of himself well-dressed was so astonishing.The design was somewhere between a school uniform and a suit, but as is, it was sophisticated enough to go to a banquet.Feeling like he was walking on a cloud, Simon looked back and forth, enjoying his new outfit.\u201cLook at this! The jacket has magic enchanted on it!\u201d\u201cThey say that school uniforms are also used as battle uniforms. It\u2019s apparently stronger than any other decent armor.\u201dSimon gently touched the school uniform jacket as he heard the voice outside the changing room. Perhaps magic was really enchanted on it. Subtle mana flowed from his clothes.I wonder how expensive this would be.In fact, it was almost like he was dressed in gold nuggets.\u201cTwo minutes before the assembly!\u201dHearing the servant\u2019s rushing, Simon hurriedly put on his shoes and went outside.The male students who had changed into Kizen\u2019s suit-like uniforms were looking at themselves in the mirror, the corners of their mouths so raised that they almost ascended to the sky.\u201cPlease come out now! We\u2019ll start moving!\u201dSimon and the male students came out of the changing room, and the girls went out of their changing room on the other side too.The two groups paused as if they planned it beforehand. That included Simon.\u2018\u2026\u2026The girl\u2019s uniform looks prettier, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019A stylish black-tone jacket with the insignia of Kizen, a white blouse, a thin tie, and a skirt that was slightly above the knee\u2026The girl\u2019s uniform was also designed to be in between the school uniform and a suit, and they all fit neatly according to their body type. It also felt that they looked a little more mature than their age.\u201cThe male students and female students will each stand in two lines and head to the main hall.\u201dMaybe because they saw each other\u2019s wonderful looks, a strange atmosphere flowed between the two groups moving towards the main hall.While walking, they looked at each other\u2019s outfits, and when their eyes met, they would quickly turn their heads. He could hear the murmur of who\u2019s handsome or who\u2019s pretty already.\u2018So this is what school life feels like.\u2019They went down the stairs and finally entered the main hall where the entrance ceremony would begin. Many freshmen had already taken their seats, and Simon\u2019s party was almost the last.\u201cSimon! Is this real? We\u2019re at Kizen! Woah\u2026 Damn! This doesn\u2019t feel real!\u201dAfter parting in the locker room for a while, Rowen somehow found Simon and started chatting with him.Simon looked around once and asked him,\u201cAre all these people freshmen?\u201d\u201cOf course! There\u2019re 1,000 freshmen in the first year!\u201dSimon\u2019s jaw dropped. It was much more than he thought.\u201cAnd I heard that there are about 300 students in the 2nd year, and less than half of that in the 3rd year.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201cYou know what I mean, right?\u201dRowen let out a dark laugh.\u201cOut of these 1,000 people, only the top 30% can be promoted to the 2nd year. The competition for survival is that fierce.\u201dHaving to struggle to survive in school.Simon couldn\u2019t really understand it using common sense. How hard could a school be to have 700 students drop out?In the meantime, all the students were seated by the servants.Rowen did a quick scan around him and began to describe various people of interest.\u201cSerne Aindark! She enrolled this year after all. The official heir to the Ivory Tower.\u201dIn the direction where Rowen was pointing, a cold-looking female student was there with her ash-blonde hair hanging down.\u201cAll the prodigies from around the world are here! Darwin Kerradin! Jay Sanders\u2026 Wow! Who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cLook behind you.\u201dWhen Simon looked back, there was one person who stood out more than anyone else.A male student over 3 meters tall. The unfortunate students who sat behind him made a long face while moving their heads.\u201cChatelle Maerre, a half-giant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026He\u2019s big.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably going to major in magic fighting. Who could handle that physique?\u2019Rowen shook his head from side to side.\u201cAnd then\u2026\u2026 Hehe.\u201dThe corner of Rowen\u2019s lips went up as he looked to the left at a person who drew many eyes, not just Rowen\u2019s.A black-haired, red-eyed girl was sitting calmly.\u201cNo matter what anyone says, this year\u2019s top will be Lorain Archbold.\u201dSimon flinched, but nodded his head without showing his thoughts.\u201cShe\u2019s Nefthis\u2019s only daughter, so people thought she would be a special admission, but apparently, she just took the entrance exam with a moderate grade.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cShe wasn\u2019t really in first or second place, but in fact, everyone probably knows that she\u2019s the best freshman this year.\u201dSimon agreed. He knew her skills better than anyone because he had seen them right in front of his eyes.At that moment, a man\u2019s voice could be heard from the platform.\u201cThen we\u2019ll now start the entrance ceremony! All students, please stand up from your seats.\u201dA man who appeared to be the master of ceremonies conducted the event.He proceeded quickly and neatly, as expected from Kizen, and the Vice-president\u2019s speech and the manager\u2019s explanation of precautions were only as long as necessary. It was really comfortable as a listener.And the biggest cheers broke loose when the teachers appeared.Like Silage, they were top-class necromancers who still played active roles. They were so famous that even Simon, who wasn\u2019t really familiar with the continent\u2019s situation, had heard of them.When idols appeared that they\u2019d only heard of through words, the students\u2019 reactions almost resembled fanatics.While Rowen next to him was foaming his mouth and shouting, Simon observed the faculty\u2019s side.\u201cSo Nefthis isn\u2019t here.\u201dRowen chuckled after hearing Simon\u2019s muttering.\u201cWhy would that great necromancer come to the 1st year\u2019s entrance ceremony? Even if you were a 3rd year, you would barely see her face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so?\u201dEven if I told him, he wouldn\u2019t believe that such a person was lost in Langerstine with ice cream in her mouth.\u201cThere\u2019ll now be the oaths of student representatives. All students, please stand from your seats.\u201dFinally, the end of this entrance ceremony approached. Simon stood up with everyone else.According to Rowen, the student representative was composed of the best 1st year male and female students.\u201cStudents who are called, please come up to the platform.\u201dThe host spoke while opening the document.\u201cSpecial Admission #2, Serene Aindark.\u201dA huge cheer broke loose. The girl with ash-blonde hair got up from her seat and walked towards the front.He could hear people everywhere talking about her being the heir of the ivory tower.\u201cAnd Special Admission #1,\u201dWhen the host opened his mouth again, silence filled the room.\u201cSimon Polentia.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The gazes of thousands of peers were focused on him.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cNo clue at all.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the number 1?\u201dIt was his first time in a place with this many people, as well as receiving this much attention.Simon kept on gulping from the tension as he climbed up to the platform and stood next to Serene.\u201cPheww.\u201dAs Simon exhaled slowly, the host came and tapped Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cNo need to be nervous. You just have to follow what it says here.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dSerene was looking at Simon. She nodded her head, and Simon replied by nodding his head back.Both of them raised their right hands simultaneously.\u201cWe solemnly pledge.\u201d\u201cWe solemnly pledge.\u201dThen he heard the 998 students shouting the same \u2018oath\u2019 from behind.\u201cThat we the freshmen\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat we the freshmen\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s head spun as he moved his mouth.He didn\u2019t understand if he was saying it correctly or what it was about. He just did his best to read in line with Serene\u2019s voice and to avoid voice cracking.And just like that, since the first day of admission,Simon got everyone\u2019s attention.* * *\u201cNo way, this is crazy! Woah! You were the 1st special admission?\u201dAs soon as Simon returned to his seat, Rowen shouted in excitement.Simon wanted to explain his side of the story, but the tight class schedule forced him to immediately go to the lecture room.It was the entrance ceremony and the first day of school, but they didn\u2019t let the students pass just like that. The first class started right away.Simon was assigned to class A. The 1st semester of the 1st year was conducted without a major, and a total of 14 classes were held.At first, over 60 people were in each class, but later this number was often cut in half, and class was frequently abolished and amalgamated.There was no one Simon knew when he entered Class A. Not just Lorain, but Rowen wasn\u2019t here either. Cindy Vivace, whom he met at the bookstore just greeted him, saying, \u201cHey Special No. 1!\u201dStill, since it was a new class, everyone had an awkward atmosphere, so Simon somehow could be covered.\u2018The first class is Curses.\u2019Simon, who sat in the back, took out his textbook and looked up, seeing the students who\u2019d been looking at Simon hurriedly turning their heads away.Slide!Finally, the lecture room door opened and the professor entered. A thunderous cheer broke loose from the students who recognized the professor.\u201cBahil Amagar!\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201dWhen people thought of the word Necromancer, they usually thought of dark and gloomy people touching a corpse and hiding in the shade.But now, that was nothing but a story of the past.Modern necromancers who had risen to become mainstream were intelligent, practical, sophisticated, and trendy. Rather, the old-fashioned and conservative image was closer to the priests.And one of the representatives of this new generation of Necromancers was Bahil.Wearing a white suit from head to toe, Bahil showed off his model-like proportions.In addition to his outstanding looks, he was a young necromancer in his late twenties with star qualities and who belonged to Kizen\u2019s core force, the \u2018Crow\u2019.He was a target of absolute admiration for the students of Kizen.Bahil smiled and waved from the cheering of the students. You could hear some girls screaming.\u201cNice to meet you, freshmen. I\u2019m Bahil Amagar, who\u2019ll be taking the 1st year Curses subject this year.\u201dCheers broke loose once more. Bahil raised his hands and skillfully calmed the students, then set the porkpie hat from his head down on the table.\u201cThen shall we call the roll? Since it\u2019s also the first time for you all to meet each other, let\u2019s include a simple introduction one by one when the names are called.\u201dBahil called the roll.\u201cJamie Victoria.\u201d\u201cYes! Professor, I\u2019m so honored! I came to this school following you\u2014!\u201dBahil reached out and interrupted Jamie, then winked playfully.\u201cYou\u2019re not introducing yourself to me. You\u2019re introducing yourself to the friends here. Again.\u201dSmall laughter could be heard. Jamie Victoria blushed and said she hoped to get along well for the semester.After Jamie started off with a smooth start, everyone introduced themselves with the casual feeling of getting along well.There was nothing to be gained for Simon to stand out in this situation, so he passed it smoothly.Some students appealed to themselves in preparation for the group class while some gloated about themselves.\u201cLooks like there are a lot of unique students. Good.\u201dBahil, who put down the roll, rolled up his sleeves and walked over to the blackboard.\u201cThen, let\u2019s start the class.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Tap. Tap tap.He took the chalk and wrote the three words \u2018Studies on Curses\u2019. When he wrote the last word, \u2018Curses\u2019, the chalk broke and flew away from the force he applied.Bahil picked up a new chalk as if used to it.\u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question. Why should we learn curses?\u201dBahil had the power of pulling the crowd from the first word. All the students craned their necks and focused to not miss a single word from him.\u201cCan anyone define what a curse is?\u201dIn the seat right in front of Simon, a girl with glasses raised her hand.\u201cI\u2019m Claudia Menzies, sir! A curse is a dark magic that weakens the opponent while maintaining your own strength!\u201d\u201cExcellent, Claudia.\u201dThe girl\u2019s face lit up with Bahil\u2019s praise.\u201cHowever, there would be some students who wouldn\u2019t really get it by saying it\u2019s simply weakening the other person. Alright. Let\u2019s say there are two knights here at the same skill level.\u201dBahil moved the chalk and held it up like a sword.\u201cThe two knights clash their swords and begin to fight fiercely. They consume each other\u2019s stamina, waiting for the other to make mistakes or reveal weak points.\u201dBahil wrote Exhaust on the blackboard.\u201cThey exchanged about twenty blows, but they wouldn\u2019t fall down. At that time, the knight facing the other knight screams and looks at the opponent with killing intent. The knight on the other side flinched and has a petrified expression on his face.\u201dBahil wrote Pressure on the blackboard.\u201cFinally, the sword cuts through the opponent\u2019s shoulder. The opponent bleeds and begins to shake his movements. Little by little, he\u2019s seizing the chance of victory!\u201dBahil wrote Bleeding on the blackboard.As the battle between the two knights progressed, more and more words were written on the blackboard.All those words were a kind of Necromancer\u2019s curse magic.The students were sweating from their hands as Bahil\u2019s voice reached a climax.\u201cAnd finally, the knight cuts off the head of his opponent!\u201dBahil lowered his arm, holding the chalk, and there was a moment of silence in the lecture room.Bahil, who looked around the students without saying a word, smiled and wrote the word \u2018Doom\u2019 on the blackboard.Exclamations broke loose everywhere.\u201cDo you understand now? Even the most primitive and barbaric battles of human beings, simply clashing with weapons, is the series of steps of weakening the opponent to lead to victory.\u201dBahil picked up a new piece of chalk.\u201cNow, we\u2019ll look at the fight of the modern Necromancer.\u201dHe scribbled a person on a blackboard.\u201cHow will the Necromancer defeat this opponent?\u201dBahil drew a circle around all the curse magic words he had written down and then\u00a0dragged him to\u00a0the edge of the blackboard to touch the person.\u201cNecromancer won.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cCurses have a simple and light structure among many dark magics and can be deployed quickly. It\u2019s efficient enough to completely shake up an opponent with a little effort.\u201dBahil winked at the male student sitting in the front row. He then swung his arm, completed the exhaustion curse within a matter of seconds, and fired it at him.\u201cHuff!\u201dJust like that, the male student sprawled in his seat. He rolled his eyes as if he couldn\u2019t move. Bahil walked slowly towards him.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dThen he pulled out the magic sword from the male student\u2019s bag and pretended to hit him on the neck.\u201c\u2026how the modern necromancer\u2019s fight.\u201dWoooooooooh!Thrilled students jumped up from their seats and cheered.Bahil smiled and bowed his head in response, releasing the curse on the student.\u201cI don\u2019t know which major you\u2019ll choose, but I boldly expect that at least 80% of freshmen will take my class in the 2nd semester. Curses are a highly compatible study. While taking advantage of your skills, calmly place a curse into your opponent whenever you have a chance. That\u2019ll be the most effective way to secure the victory.\u201dHe walked back to the platform.\u201cThen let\u2019s talk a little bit about something you guys might find interesting.\u201dAnd then, under the \u2018Studies on Curses\u2019 written on the blackboard, he began to write new words.\u201cI personally believe that studies on curses are the core of modern Necromancer. The reason is\u2026\u201dHe wrote \u2018priest\u2019 on the blackboard.\u201cBecause it\u2019s the most effective means of dealing with our main enemy.\u201dFrom the first class, he touched a sensitive topic. A strong sense of hostility immediately arose in the eyes of the students.\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you all. If the Necromancer has a \u2018Curse\u2019, the Priest has a \u2018Blessing\u2019. The difference between strengthening magic and weakening magic. And right here.\u201dBahil chuckled.\u201cIs there any student who can explain what makes a curse better than a blessing?\u201dAll voices were hushed.While the students stole glances at one another, one raised a hand.It was Jamie Victoria, the first one to be called on the roll.\u201cJamie Victoria, sir. Curses have a faster casting speed than Blessings! You can stack up debuffs faster, even on the same opponent!\u201d\u201cInteresting opinion.\u201dBahil folded his arms.\u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. In terms of casting speed alone, It\u2019s the general opinion of the scholars that the blessing of a priest is slightly faster than a curse that has to be cast through the opponent\u2019s resistance.\u201dJamie bit her lips frustratedly and sat back down.\u201cAnyone else with a different opinion?\u201dThen there was a person who raised his arm.He was a male student with a defined face, thick eyebrows, tall height, and good physique.\u201cHector Moore, sir.\u201d\u201cPlease go on.\u201d\u201cThere is almost no one who trains themselves in a weakened state.\u201dIt was an enigmatic answer, but a deep smile crept on Bahil\u2019s lips.\u201cMister, what was your name again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Hector Moore.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201dWoah\u2026Voices full of envy resounded all around.There were a thousand freshmen. The chances of surviving increased if you were somehow favored by professor, so it was great merit to have your name remembered.\u201cHector is right. It\u2019s because weakening magic can\u2019t be stopped by training.\u201dHe looked at the students.\u201cEveryone trains on the premise that they\u2019re in a normal condition. The measure of your ability is the level of performance you can pull off when all environments are within your control.\u201dThe students nodded.\u201cHumans are much more delicate animals than they look, and even the smallest change can break them. Cutting out the arm of the archer who pointed the bow at me isn\u2019t the only answer. Obstructing their vision by eye inflammation, giving him motion sickness, confusing the sense of distance, or distracting him by other means. The arrow that should\u2019ve hit me may miss.\u201dBahil raised the corner of his lips.\u201cNecromancers have a variety of means to lower the enemy\u2019s condition. But think about it. There\u2019s no one who\u2019d train for a curse when they\u2019re tired or have a bad tummy that feels like their intestines are breaking, right? They\u2019d just take a day off.\u201dSmall laughter from the students could be heard.\u201cSo remember. Rather than strengthening ourselves, we need to figure out how to weaken them.\u201dThe students nodded and moved their quills. They started taking notes since it sounded like it would definitely appear on the exam.\u201cAnd now, we\u2019ll have some time to learn a curse.\u201dSimon, who was jotting down the notes with the others, suddenly raised his head.\u2018What? We\u2019re learning dark magic in our first class?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBahil\u2019s assistants showed up and prepared one practice set for each student.On the right side, a plant resembling a cactus was placed on a sandboard, and on the left side, a \u2018magic circle frame\u2019 that resembled a cast or a mold was placed. It was a magic circle rectifying tool for beginner necromancers.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for Kizen students to use the rectifying tool, but since it\u2019s our first class, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201dSaid Bahil.\u201cIt\u2019s good to get the hang of it, but please be careful not to rely too much on a rectifying tool as it can develop a bad habit. Now! Let\u2019s start practicing the fatigue curse, \u2018Exhaust\u2019!\u201dBahil kindly taught how to use the rectifying tool, and Simon followed him exactly as instructed.He grabbed both handles on the rectifying tool, squeezed the jet-black, and poured it into the handles.The jet-black flowed in the rectifying tool and gradually formed a magic circle.\u201cThe key is how well you establish the main rune.\u201dTo put it simply, \u2018Runes\u2019 were letters with magical power, and by writing these letters using jet-black, a magical effect could be created.Simon concentrated on writing the primary rune and the activation formula on the edge of the magic circle.Of course, since it was an operation done using a mold, he could draw the magic circle without understanding the structure in his head.\u201cNow, students who have completed it, please float the magic circle in the air.\u201dSimon swallowed his saliva and tried to raise the completed magic circle. A dark blue jet-black magic circle broke out of the mold and floated in the air.\u2018Woah!\u2019It was a real magic circle. He was able to create the same technique that his father, Richard, used at times too!He had some doubts about whether this would really activate dark magic, but he couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it.Looking around, about half of the students in the class had their magic circles floating in the air.\u2018Ah!\u2019While he was spacing out for a moment, one side of the magic circle that Simon had made turned into a liquid and flowed down.\u201cI can see some students whose shape of the magic circle breaks down.\u201dSaid Bahil immediately.\u201cIt happens when the jet-black isn\u2019t refined properly or when the solidarity of the magic circle is weakened. Try again.\u201dSimon clenched his teeth and started all over again.\u201cAnd for those students who can keep their magic circle in the air, let\u2019s get into the action right away! Use the curse on the plant in front of your desk!\u201dThe successful students took a deep breath and activated the magic circle all at once.Whish!The black gas fired from the magic circle was directed at the cactus-like plant.Half of them didn\u2019t show any change, and the other half had their plants droop.\u201cCongratulations. If there\u2019s any significant change to the plant, the magic circle is working properly.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe male student next to Simon clenched his fist.Simon held back his envy and resumed his magic circle work.\u201cThe gap can be observed already. For the successful students, please repeat it to increase the speed of magic circle completion, and for those who think that the speed is sufficient, let\u2019s practice creating a magic circle in the air without using a rectifying tool.\u201dTime passed quickly, and Simon tasted his fourth failure.There was no problem with creating the magic circle, but it turned into a mushy porridge and fell to the floor when he floated it in the air.\u2018What\u2019s the problem here?\u2019Simon became nervous as the number of successful students increased.Of course, Kizen was a gathering place for the best talents on the continent, and most of the students came after preparing the lessons in advance.It was natural for Simon to be at a loss\u2014it was his first time encountering dark magic\u2014but such self-justification didn\u2019t exist in Simon\u2019s head.Why did it fail?-But it still has the properties of mana. To see it surging like fire means that it hasn\u2019t been able to get out of the gaseous state.-He needs to learn to use his core more effectively.The moment he recalled the voices of Nefthis and Lorain, whom he met in Langerstine, Simon took his hand off from the rectifying tool. He then closed his eyes and focused on the mana in his body.\u2018Back to the basics.\u2019Drawing mana into the body through breathing and transferring that mana to the core below the heart.Same so far. However, Simon didn\u2019t drain his mana into his core right away, but first gathered as much as he could.\u2018Ugh!\u2019He felt a tingling pain in the lower part of his heart, but he clenched his teeth and endured it. Then, he shoved the lump of mana he had gathered to the limit into the core at once.When he powerfully inserted a large amount of mana at once, the jet-black became harder and flowed out of the core. It was a temporary measure that Simon, who had not yet learned how to use the core, came up with.\u2018Now, here I go!\u2019Simon opened his eyes and grabbed the handle of the rectifying tool.The jet-black color with increased purity was placed in the mold faster than before. Simon quickly finished working on the rune and formula before floating his magic circle in the air.\u2018It\u2019s working!\u2019Now it wouldn\u2019t break.Simon moved the magic circle and aimed at the plant on the sandboard. He wanted to succeed while he got the hang of it.\u2018Exhaust!\u2019When the magic circle was activated, the gray smoke from the center of the rune hit the plant.Swish.The stiff body of the plant drooped.\u2018It worked!\u2019\u201cNow, enough, everyone.\u201dBahil clapped his hands.\u201cFor the students who haven\u2019t succeeded until the end, please continue practicing in the dormitory.\u201dVoices of frustration could be heard from here and there. Bahil returned to the platform and held up the roll book.\u201cNow! We\u2019ll hold a practice match with the magic we learned today for the rest of the time. For the students who are called, please come forward.\u201dSuddenly, a huge tension struck the lecture room. The students were busy avoiding Bahil\u2019s eyes.Bahil smiled and looked at the roll book.\u201cOh? The Special Admission No.1 was in this class, huh?\u201dThe students looked back simultaneously.\u201cSimon Polentia. Please come forward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes sir.\u201dI was feeling kind of uneasy, but it ended up like this after all.Simon pulled himself together while going to the platform.There\u2019s no reason to be nervous since I succeeded in the end. Just keep the ball rolling.The students flinched, avoiding Bahil\u2019s gaze. Bahil browsed his roll book with a smile, as if seeing the students acting like that was fun.\u201cThere are two students with impressive entrance scores.\u201dBahil, who had been thinking about who to call between the two of them, finally opened his mouth.\u201cHector Moore. Please come forward.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dIt was that huge male student Bahil said he\u2019d remember. Hector got up and went up to the platform.Soon, the two of them stood facing each other on the platform.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon held his breath. This male student named Hector felt much bigger when face to face like this.\u201cI\u2019ll start explaining the rules.\u201dThe assistants put a stand desk in front of Simon and Hector. On top of that, there was the rectifying tool for Exhaust that they used in class.\u201cOnly Exhaust is allowed for the both of you. Complete the Exhaust and use it on your opponent! Whoever hits the floor with the knee or butt first loses.\u201dThe rules were simple.Simon strengthened his resolve. Since it came to this, standing up in front of everyone, he wanted to win.\u201cProfessor.\u201dAt that moment, Hector raised his hand.\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll battle without using the rectifying tool.\u201dWhew-You could hear whistle sounds from the room. The students were now relaxed and ready to enjoy the match between the two.\u201cWhat an excellent mindset.\u201dAt the beginning of the class, Bahil had a nuance that he wasn\u2019t happy with using a rectifying tool. As Hector observed this, he appealed his skills and confidence while earning a score with an offer that Bahil would like.He was clever, contrary to his rugged bear-like look.Bahil turned his head to look at Simon.\u201cHow about you, Simon?\u201dSimon\u2019s mouth went dry. Everyone here was watching him with eyes full of expectation.Honestly, it was a difficult atmosphere for him to refuse the offer, but\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll use the rectifying tool.\u201dIt\u2019s better to face reality than to be arrogant.It would be worse to accept that offer and diminish powerlessly without a single successful Exhaust.Bahil looked at Hector with a bitter smile, and Hector replied as if waiting,\u201cI have no intention of withdrawing what I said.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dHector completely grabbed the influence of the crowd.Hector imprinted the impression of Simon being the petty Special Admission No. 1 and him being honest and confident.It was obvious who people watching would cheer for.\u201cBegin the match on my cue. I hope that both of you\u2019ll show a great match in front of your classmates.\u201dHector lowered his posture and Simon grabbed the handle of the rectifying tool.\u201cStart the match!\u201dSimon raised the jet-black he had prepared and put it in the rectifying tool. Jet-black quickly spread and filled the magic circle mold.\u2018I can do it!\u2019Maybe because of the tension, the jet-black wouldn\u2019t extend as it did during the practice, but he patiently waited for the magic circle to be completed.Just when he was about to continue the detailed formula after the main rune in the center was written\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, Simon\u2019s body felt heavy, and his legs started to tremble.\u2018No way!\u2019Simon raised his head. Hector was smiling triumphantly, already completing his first spell.\u201cWooooooah!\u201d\u201cWay to go, Hector!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so fast.\u201dHector was riding on the momentum and started preparing a second spell immediately, while Simon clenched his teeth and tried to maintain his pace.\u2018My body feels heavy, even if it was just one shot!\u2019He was sweating and his legs shook.Simon could feel why the curse was threatening and an effective means to attack his whole body.The moment Simon floated the magic circle completed with the rectifying tool in the air, one side of the circle collapsed like porridge.Ah~ Groans could be heard from the room.Even if he could activate this, it wouldn\u2019t have any effect since the formula was damaged. Simon let go of it and prepared a new magic circle.\u2018Kugh!\u2019And Hector\u2019s second Exhaust burst on Simon. He felt his stamina draining, and his body got heavier.It was the worst. Even focusing on casting was already tough, and now standing upright was becoming exhausting.A situation where you inevitably couldn\u2019t concentrate.The progress of the battle flowed one-sidedly.Hector activated the 3rd, 4th, and 5th exhausts and fired them at Simon without mercy. Simon\u2019s knees trembled as if they were about to give away.The students liked Hector\u2019s fierce attack for a while, but now they were looking at Simon with pity.\u2018It\u2019s over. He\u2019s no match.\u2019\u2018He can\u2019t even hit a single strike?\u2019\u2018Is he really Special Admission No.1?\u2019Simon failed to build a magic circle twice in a row as his condition and concentration was extremely low.Hector spoke as he fired the 6th Exhaust on Simon.\u201cJust give up. You look pathetic.\u201dSimon became desperate and gave strength to his legs.I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t back off like this.\u2018One more time!\u2019Following the third attempt, Hector sighed and prepared his 7th Exhaust.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u2019Bahil was observing the battle of two students with his arms crossed.That boy named Hector was definitely the real deal. Aside from being talented in Curses, he had a great mindset as a student.A person who\u2019d survive up to the 3rd year. He thought that he\u2019d definitely take this guy.\u2018The Special admission No.1 on the other hand\u2026\u2026\u2019To be honest, he was terrible. Learning the lessons ahead was entry-level for Kizen, and there were students who\u2019d even gone through the actual fights.However, the student who had the title of Special admission No.1 didn\u2019t have any basic skills at all. As if it was his first time learning dark magic.\u2018Why did Nefthis choose this boy as the Special Admission No.1?\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The special admissions 1, 2, 3, and 4 that were formally invited to Kizen by skipping the cruel entrance exam were really the talented people of the century.Among them, the selection of special admission No.1 was the authority of Nefthis, the ruler and president of Kizen, and each one of them had grown into a big shot.However, for a student chosen by Nefthis herself, he was hopeless.If there was something special about him, maybe it was his physical strength.Usually, students knelt after taking 4 exhausts. But now, Simon was holding up even after being hit a whopping nine times.He was born gifted with physical strength. He must\u2019ve been training his body too. And seeing him still holding on to magic in a situation where it was difficult to even stand, his mental strength was pretty good too.However, that was it. If it was Professor Hong Feng of Combat Magic, she would\u2019ve been drooling, but it didn\u2019t really appeal to Bahil.\u201cKuhugh!\u201dSimon opened his eyes and floated his fourth magic circle above the mold. It was completely formed and didn\u2019t flow down in the air this time.Simon immediately activated the magic. A gray gas shot out and hit Hector\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHector, who was preparing a spell, stumbled massively. For instance, he almost lost his balance as his knees bent, but he barely managed to stay up by putting his hands to the floor.\u2018It finally worked!\u2019Simon clenched his fist. A look of bewilderment appeared on Hector\u2019s face for the first time as he raised his head.\u2018What? Why is this so heavy?\u2019Hector had experienced Exhaust as a preparation in advance.But was the curse this heavy? He almost got knocked out with just one shot.Still, the score was 9:1. He was undoubtedly in the position of advantage.But Hector, who had allowed Simon\u2019s first shot, felt an unknown nervousness. The opponent following him like a leech grabbing his trouser leg was supremely annoying.\u2018Just fall already!\u2019Hector pulled out all his concentration and activated the 10th magic circle floating in the air.Thud.Finally, Simon, who took the Exhaust 10 times, knelt down on one knee on the floor.\u201cStop. The match is over.\u201dBahil came forward and said,\u201cThe winner is Hector Moore.\u201dThe applause of the students filled the room.Hector looked away, wiping the sweat off his forehead.He saw Simon sitting there, sweating buckets.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t feel like he won.When Hector first hit his Exhaust, he could tell that his opponent was a beginner.A person who never learned dark magic. So, the fight should\u2019ve ended there.It should\u2019ve ended there, but\u2026He wouldn\u2019t fall down.Even after taking 9 shots of Exhaust, even if his legs trembled, he managed to complete the magic and hit Hector once.\u2018\u2026Creepy bastard.\u2019Before he got bigger.Before, one day, he became so huge that no one could stop him,Wouldn\u2019t it be better to crush him while I still can?Hector thought that to himself seriously.\u201cYou did a good job too, Simon. Please go back to your seat.\u201dWhen Bahil snapped his fingers, the 10 stacks of Exhaust curse that had been holding Simon down were lifted.The curse was lifted, but the tiredness he had endured in the meantime remained intact. A sour odor came out of his mouth.But still.\u2018Pheww.\u2019He had no regrets. Simon got up with a sense of relief.\u2018It was fun.\u2019He felt good about coming to this school.\u201cWell then. I\u2019ll dismiss the class today.\u201dBahil immediately declared the end of class. The students ebbed away from the lecture room, and Bahil sat back in his chair. Then he closed his eyes and stayed still, as if meditating.\u201cP-Professor.\u201dAt that moment, a female student reading Bahil\u2019s face came up to him.\u201cI have a question about the cla\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease wait a minute.\u201d\u201cCome to my lab after all the class for today is over, please. Then I\u2019ll answer all your questions.\u201d\u201cR-Really? T-Thank you so much!\u201dWhat a welcome windfall.The female student ran out of the lecture room with a small scream at the fact that she had been invited to Bahil\u2019s lab.Bahil was staring at her back with his bleary eyes.\u2018Gotta resist myself.\u2019Insults rose up his throat.This feeling.This emotion right now.He didn\u2019t want to waste his lingering feeling on a cheap thing like that.Bahil closed his eyes again and recalled the class, as if savoring it.\u2018\u2026\u2026Simon Polentia.\u2019He was thinking of none other than Simon.At first, he thought he was simply a guy with good physical strength, but that wasn\u2019t it.All the students in the class probably thought that Simon was destroyed one-sidedly by a score of 10:1.But that one strike of Exhaust he fired at Hector in the end.In the eyes of the professor, who read the talents and possibilities of the students, the single Exhaust that Simon cast was several times, no, at least ten times more valuable than the 10 Exhausts Hector had cast.Simon\u2019s Exhaust played over and over again in his head.\u2018This is the best!\u2019The side of Bahil\u2019s mouth tore open.\u201cI need to make a genius like that major in Curses no matter what!\u2019Bahil\u2019s inherent desire began to itch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe following classes were also a series of troubles.The 2nd period was Defense against the Holy Arts, and the 3rd period was Hemomancy, and every single professor tested Simon as the No.1 Special Admission by calling him out to the platform.It was like a yearly event. The truth was, in Kizen, obviously the competition between students was fierce, but it also was for the professors.Professors with poor performance were fired, even during the semester. Their salaries fluctuated according to performance, and their power of influence inside Kizen also changed.Therefore, the professors tried to secure as many students as possible in their majors and especially attract outstanding students as their direct disciples.As part of that, they were testing the skills of the best students in their first class, and it was natural for Simon, the No.1 Special Admission, to come up to the platform.In those two classes, Simon had to go against a female student named \u2018Meilyn Villenne\u2019.She was the top of class A and the holder of the highest entrance exam score in the whole first year. Judging from the written exam alone, she was practically a person with talent close to the top of the whole school.There was no way Simon, who had just begun to study dark magic, could win against her. In the battle against Hector, he somehow managed to return a single shot, but it was almost impossible to win against MeilynThe professor tilted their heads at this unexpected situation, and the students of Class A now noticed that Simon was a total beginner.\u2018Errrrgh\u2026\u2026\u2019They restlessly finished the third class too. Fortunately, the next class ended a little earlier, so they had some free time.Simon was resting alone on the empty cafeteria table.\u2018The classes are fun, but it\u2019s so hard.\u2019He didn\u2019t know that school classes would be this hard. The fact that he lost all his strength in the battle against Hector was a huge factor too.Simon groaned and rested his head on his arm.\u201cHi.\u201dWhile Simon was catching his breath, somebody came up and spoke to him.When he looked up, he saw a smiling young male student with short blonde hair and sunglasses on his forehead.\u201cI\u2019m in Class A, just like you. My name is Rick Hayward.\u201d\u201c\u2026Simon Polentia.\u201dThe two shook their hands lightly.\u201cYou\u2019ve become so famous already. Your name is on the lips of other classes too, you know?\u201dSimon shrugged.\u201cThey\u2019re probably talking about how overrated the No.1 Special Admission is.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dRick laughed and sat down opposite Simon.\u201cActually, you\u2019re perfectly normal. I wonder why everyone\u2019s acting rashly when we\u2019re still on our first day.\u201d\u201cThank you for your words.\u201dRick locked his fingers together with a slightly serious expression on his face.\u201cDid you know? Hector is already forming his own faction.\u201d\u201c\u2026Faction?\u201d\u201cSince he showed an impressive appearance in the first class. It\u2019s only natural for him to attract people. He\u2019s also the eldest son of a powerful family, so he\u2019s popular among the nobles too.\u201dSimon rested his chin on his hands with a sour face.\u201cI\u2019m not really interested.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, listen. \u2018Politics\u2019 are also important in Kizen! What do you think would happen if Class A falls to the hands of Hector like this? Those who gets marked by Hector would meet their end. It\u2019ll be difficult to find a team member to work with on group assignments too.\u201dThen it was a different story. Simon fixed his posture.\u201cYou seem to have a quick grasp of the situation. But why are you here instead of going to Hector?\u201dRick gave a surprised look, as if Simon hit the nail right on the head.\u2018He\u2019s pretty sharp, unlike his innocent looks.\u2019Rick smiled awkwardly and scratched the side of his head.\u201cActually, I\u2019m a commoner. From a merchant family.\u201dThen he got up and respectfully bowed his head.\u201cI apologize if a commoner like me was being rude, Sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026Stop that. I heard that we\u2019re all the same 1st-year students in Kizen.\u201dRick chuckled, pleased, and sat down.\u201cI know, but there are some kids who give themselves the air of a noble so\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t at least.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Actually, I have something to offer to you.\u201dRick held out his hand.\u201cCome to my faction, Simon.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhether you\u2019re lacking in skills or marked as overrated, it\u2019s unequivocally true that you\u2019re the No.1 Special Admission. The advance preparation for lessons might seem big now, but eventually, everything will be equal. Wouldn\u2019t Nefthis have brought you here as a special admission for a reason? You\u2019re worth it.\u201dSimon smiled.\u201cInstead of factions or anything like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSimon reached out his hand in front of Rick\u2019s.\u201cHow about we just become equal friends?\u201dRick let out a silly laugh.\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow. That sounded super awkward.\u201dTo think that there were still people who want to be friends rather than being \u2018allies\u2019 or \u2018faction members\u2019.Honestly, it was so out of style.It was cringe.However, Simon\u2019s approach felt special among all the people guided by self-interest.Rick reached out and grabbed Simon\u2019s hand firmly.\u201cThis kind of thing wouldn\u2019t be bad at times.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t bad for Simon to be friends with a student who knew Kizen well and had a sense for politics.The two got up from their seats after shaking hands.They had to move to the lecture room where the next class will be held soon.\u201cWhat\u2019s our next class again?\u201d\u201cGimme a sec.\u201dRick pulled a notebook out of his pocket and opened it.\u201cAh. It\u2019s summoning.\u201dHearing that, Simon\u2019s eyes lit up.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon and Rick got to the lecture room on time.Unlike in the first class, the air had loosened up. Everyone was sharing stories with classmates they became close with.And just as Rick said, four boys were chatting and laughing around Hector. Then, as Simon passed by, they let out a silent sneer.\u201cOh my, dear No.1 Special Admission is passing by.\u201d\u201cThe rare \u2018overrated\u2019 in the history of Kizen.\u201d\u201cDoes it make sense that someone like him beat Serne, Chatel, and Lorain?\u201dThey were ridiculing Simon, but Hector, who was in the group\u2019s center, was quiet. He just looked at Simon for a moment then turned his head.\u201cDon\u2019t mind them, Simon\u201dSaid Rick.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to listen to what wingmen are saying.\u201dSimon sat down with an expressionless face and took out the textbook for summoning class.\u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cFor the Summoning class.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes were sparkling. Without having to tell him, he looked like he didn\u2019t care at all.Rick giggled.\u2018He really is a different one after all.\u2019After a while, the bell rang to signal the start of class. The students hurriedly returned to their seats.Scuff. Scuff.They could hear foot-dragging outside the lecture room.Including \u2018Bahil Amagar\u2019 of Curses, all of the professors they\u2019d seen until now were amazing people. The students waited in high hopes of who would enter.Click.Finally, the lecture room door opened, and a man that looks like he was in his thirties entered.Messy hair, as if he had just woken up, a ragged beard that looked like he hadn\u2019t shaved for a long time, a baggy shirt and shorts, and old slippers.Simon wondered if a passing neighborhood old man had entered the lecture room by mistake.It was the same for the other students. Since they\u2019d only been seeing neat and smartly dressed professors until now, it was a bit shocking for them.The professor dragged his slippers and stood in front of the professor\u2019s desk.\u201cI\u2019m \u2018Aaron Deia\u2019, who\u2019ll be in charge of your Summoning class for the semester.\u201dA languid voice echoed through the lecture room.Aaron walked to the blackboard and slowly wrote down the word Summoning.You could feel his tiredness, with one hand in his pocket and writing with the other, but perhaps that was another charming point. Some female students babbled with their flushed faces.\u201cSummoning is the root of the Necromancer and can be said to be the history itself. Scholars are reluctant to admit it, but it\u2019s hard to deny that our origins come from the undertaker, grave robber, and Necrophilia.\u201dAaron put down the chalk with a gloomy smile.\u201cNow let us proceed. If you guys have ears, you\u2019ve probably heard a lot about the Summoning. As it\u2019s outdated, it\u2019s not treated well, or it\u2019s difficult to study, and there are too many handicaps.\u201dSome students nodded their heads sympathetically.\u201cThose kinds of prejudices that you all heard\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon felt his heart beating little by little. The other students gulped and waited for Aaron\u2019s next words.\u201cMost of them are true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201dSimon doubted his ears.What did this Summoning professor just say?Aaron continued explaining in a drowsy voice.\u201cIn the classes you took earlier, I believe there were a lot of talks on why their major is great and why you should take it. Personally, I\u2019m against it. We need to clearly state all the pros and cons so that students can make the right choice.\u201dAaron went back to the blackboard and took the chalk. Students also held their quills to take notes.\u201cThe first disadvantage of Summoning.\u201dSimon let out a bitter laugh.You\u2019re telling us the disadvantages first?\u201cSummoning is expensive.\u201dAfter Aaron had written it on the blackboard, he turned to the students.\u201cI\u2019m not just saying it. No matter how much you\u2019re imagining, Summoning is a study that costs a lot more than that.\u201dSuddenly there was silence in the lecture room.\u201cThe cost for the material of one summoning class may be higher than the material cost of all other subjects combined. That\u2019s natural. Are you going to kill the people next to you, raid the village, search for animals, and slaughter them one by one whenever you create a skeleton or a zombie? No. Necromancers these days use a skeleton set, or specially processed corpses that can be turned directly into zombies. Besides, most of the undead created this way are one-time use.\u201dSome students\u2019 faces sombered. In particular, the expression of commoner students noticeably worsened.\u201cIt\u2019s common that the cost of materials consumed during the battle is more than the reward of a mission. If you\u2019re going to major in Summoning, give up on making money. And secondly,\u201dAaron wrote the next statement.\u201cThe dependency on your Summons is high. Well, this is pretty much obvious too. Summoning is the study of fighting using your summons.\u201dAaron raised his hand holding the chalk and circled the word \u2018Dependency\u2019 several times.\u201cWhen the summoned creature is destroyed, the fighting power of a summoner drops by over 80%.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEspecially these days, there are many cases of using your own semi-permanent undead that has been modified and modified rather than a single-use undead. But what if this undead is destroyed during the battle?\u201dAaron raised the corner of his lips.\u201cIn an actual situation, imagine yourself sucking your thumb after losing your summon while your comrades spread the map and discuss their tactics diligently.\u201dSimon became more and more dumbfounded.Isn\u2019t this too much? Is this person really a professor for Summoning?\u201cAnd this dependency is in line with the first disadvantage.\u201dAaron drew a line around the circled word \u2018dependency\u2019 and connected it to \u2018expensive\u2019.\u201cIf you lose your primary summon, the Summoner suffers critical damage both financially and in fighting power. You\u2019ll have to spend a lot of time gathering money to restore the fighting power.\u201dA deep silence fell on the lecture room.\u201cAnd lastly, the third.\u201dAaron, who was writing on the blackboard, grinned a toothy grin.\u201cThis one is the most important.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Summoning is weak in battle against the priests.\u201dThis time, Simon also had to go wide-eyed.The dispute with the side of Priest has been the most sensitive issue for students recently, and all the professors so far have appealed with strength in this area.But Aaron was the complete opposite.\u201cI have said it like this, but to be exact, the study of summoning isn\u2019t suitable for the modern war itself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen summoning can play an active role is an \u2018all-out war\u2019. When tens of thousands collide in a large-scale battle, the summoner will receive an infinite supply of materials to summon an undead. However, the current battle where the armistice has been signed takes the form of a small wars against priests who\u2019re on a mission. It\u2019s an inevitable trend where the Cursing or Necromantic magics where you can do a quick hit and run are popular.Although he was saying, in other words, that his major was outdated, Aaron was emotionless.\u201cAnd it\u2019s also true that summoning magic is weak against Priests. Just imagine an undead army that you put a lot of money and effort into being shattered with a single Holy spell that the priests cast. You\u2019re just at a disadvantage to begin with.\u201dAaron put down his chalk and turned to his students.\u201cOther than these, there are countless disadvantages that I have not mentioned, but the decision is yours.\u201dAt that moment, someone raised a hand.It was the same student who first presented during the class of curses.\u201cI\u2019m Jamie Victoria! I\u2019d like to know the advantages of summoning!\u201dOther professors may have found it commendable to have a disciple who helped them appeal like this, but that wasn\u2019t the case for Aaron.\u201cI don\u2019t recall allowing questions yet.\u201dJamie felt goosebumps rising all over her body. The other relaxed students belatedly came to their senses and fixed their postures too.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201dJamie bowed her head.But as Aaron was a professor, he had an obligation to answer his students\u2019 questions.He kicked his tongue and opened his mouth.\u201cThe strength of summoning is quantity. Apart from fighting alone, you can get help from your summons. Through this, you can develop a variety of tactics, even with a necromancer alone. Did that answer your question?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAaron folded his arms.\u201cIt\u2019s your choice whether to take Summoning in the second semester or choose Summoning as your major. But just keep this in mind.\u201dAaron\u2019s voice became serious. He seemed to be a completely different person from when he was conducting the class loosely.\u201cDon\u2019t even think of stepping in this area if you aren\u2019t determined enough.\u201dAaron was really different from other professors.\u201cI\u2019m telling you that you shouldn\u2019t even think about majoring in this study with a soft mindset where you would get frustrated, complain, feel ashamed, and eventually ask for counselling to shift courses beyond your 2nd year.\u201dThe way Aaron spat his words sounded like he had some deep resentment as well.Aaron\u2019s assistants standing behind him were also sighing quietly.\u201cEspecially if there\u2019s anyone who wants to major in Summoning for survival because of the low competition. I\u2019ll expel them with my own hands. That\u2019s all.\u201dAt that, he declared to the students,\u201c\u2026\u2026Then I\u2019ll now start the class.\u201dWhen Aaron returned with his drowsy voice and gave a gesture, the assistants moved quickly and placed the skeleton sets on the students\u2019 desks.Simon drew a sigh and looked at the skeleton set on the desk.Pieces of bone were sorted inside the box. He noticed that, upon closer inspection, numbers were engraved on the bone.\u201cWhat you guys have there is the bones of \u2018Island Rat Man\u2019. They have a skeleton structure similar to a human but are simpler and cheaper. Most beginners who study summoning start with this one.\u201dThe assistant for summoning pasted a paper that consisted of the detailed bone structure and numbers for the Island Rat Men.\u201cWe\u2019ll begin. Take out No.1, the skull.\u201dSimon and the students lifted the skull, nervous, and placed them on the table.Some girls squinted their eyes a little as if it were disgusting, but no more. There was no hesitation in how they handled it, as expected from the girls who entered Kizen.\u201cThe skull is pre-assembled. There\u2019s a part where you can put your hand in the lower part and there\u2019s a magic circle rectifying frame inside the skull. Everyone put your hands on it and establish that magic circle.\u201dIt was true. It had a similar structure to the magic circle rectifying tool for the first Curses class, except it was engraved directly on the skull.Simon squeezed the jet black and let it flow through the magic circle rectifying frame.\u2018Alright.\u2019I\u2019m now pretty used to using the rectifying tool.\u201cAnd when the magic circle is complete\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cUwaah! Aaaaagh!\u201dThe screams of students broke loose from everywhere.When the magic circle was completed, the skull suddenly came to life, popping the jaw and making a clicking sound.One after another, students with skulls in their hands threw them away in surprise or fell from their chairs in shock. Even Rick, sitting next to Simon, was panting with his hand on his chest.\u201cI was going to say that when the magic circle is complete, the undead will start moving, so don\u2019t be surprised. But I guess I was a little too late.\u201dSaid Aaron, smiling mischievously.Some students looked at him with resentful eyes, but they didn\u2019t dare to complain.Meanwhile, Simon also completed the magic circle of the skull. The then skull popped around the table as if it were alive.\u201cStay still.\u201dSimon grabbed the skull that was about to fall off the desk and placed it on the desk. Then, the undead behaved as if it understood the words of Simon.\u201c\u2026Simon, are you used to these?\u201dRick in the seat next to him was in disgust, like he didn\u2019t want to touch the undead.Simon shrugged his shoulders. His father was a necromancer, so there were many instances of skeletons wandering around the house.\u201cGet used to it. You guys are necromancers.\u201dAaron continued to speak with his hands in his pockets.\u201cAnd with the magic circle you just activated, the undead is almost complete. Of course, it can\u2019t move because it doesn\u2019t have a body. Now it\u2019s your turn to make the body of the skeleton.\u201dAaron tapped the picture of the Island Rat Man\u2019s bone structure on the blackboard.\u201cA necromancer must have a complete understanding of the bone structure of the creature that\u2019ll be their summons. Normally, humans have 206 bones, but Island Rat Men have 53, so it\u2019s much easier. First, find No.2, the cervical vertebra.\u201dThe students rummaged through the skeleton set. Simon also found a bone with the words \u2018No.2\u2019 written on it.\u201cNow attach the No.2 bone to the skull.\u201dSimon turned his head.\u2018There\u2019s no tool for sticking it. How am I supposed to connect this?\u2019Simon unsurely placed the No.2 bone under the skull.Then, like the attraction of a magnet, the bones in his hands trembled and tried to stick. When Simon loosened the grip a little, the bones attached themselves with a loud tap.\u2018Oh, that\u2019s fascinating.\u2019Simon blinked his eyes.\u201cAgain, the entire magic that moves the skeleton was completed by activating the magic circle earlier. And skeletons have a tendency to turn back to their former body shape.\u201dAaron turned his head back to the picture of the bones.\u201cNext is the No.3 bone.\u201dSimon placed the skull on the desk, found the bones that matched the number, and connected them step by step.\u201cProceed till No. 11 in the same way.\u201d\u201cI-It worked!\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201dThe bones attached to each other by finding them and bringing them close to themselves. Simon\u2019s skeleton, completed up to the neck, moved its head up and down as if celebrating.Simon let out a laugh.\u2018It\u2019s so fun!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s not a human bone, but the discomfort and awkwardness disappeared.\u2019It felt like assembling a moving bone sculpture according to the blueprint, so Simon could fully immerse himself in the class.\u201cBe careful not to confuse the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Island Rat Men are animals that walks upright, and the completion of the spine that supports the back of the body is the most important.\u201d\u201cIf the sequence of bone assembly is wrong, the movement won\u2019t be smooth. It\u2019ll creak and cause movement problems, often breaking down at critical moments.\u201d\u201cNow immediately proceed up to No 16.\u201dThere were many students who were worried about Aaron\u2019s atmosphere at the beginning of the class, but in fact, the summoning class was fun enough to be liked by everyone.In a lively atmosphere, everyone showed off each other\u2019s finished work or asked questions. Aaron didn\u2019t particularly stop that kind of free atmosphere.\u201cWe\u2019re almost done. Proceed up to No 53. For those who are stuck, raise your hand.\u201d\u201cProfessor! I can\u2019t really attach the leg over here!\u201d\u201cWah, Professor! My skeleton keeps running away!\u201dSimon succeeded in creating the skeleton at once without any trial and error. A skeleton, slightly shorter than a human, formed with a pop.\u2018\u2026\u2026So this is the skeleton made with my jet-black.\u2019While he was watching it, emotional, the skeleton tilted its head.Simon couldn\u2019t help but smile at that sight.\u201cHey! Take care of your summon! He\u2019s hitting me!\u201d\u201cI did order it to hit you, though.\u201d\u201cKyah! Look at this! I can make it dance too!\u201d\u201c\u2026I wonder why this is cute?\u201dCheerful laughter could be heard everywhere. The students who successfully completed the skeleton were busy playing with their summons.Meanwhile,\u201cSimon! Please look at my skeleton!\u201dThere were some students who couldn\u2019t do it. Rick, sitting next to him, was tearing his hair out.\u201cWhy does this guy keep on attaching his legs to his arms!\u201dRick\u2019s skeleton had his right leg attached to his shoulder instead of his right arm, and he was walking with tottery steps. Seeing this, the other students held their sides with laughter.\u201cHm.\u201dSimon looked at the unipedal skeleton with serious eyes.\u201cI think you confused the leg and arm parts. That\u2019s why the skeleton is thinking that their legs are arms.\u201d\u201cR-Really?\u201d\u201cLook at this. Bone No.21 is a leg bone, not an arm bone.\u201d\u201cOh, right! Why do they all look so similar?\u201dTime passed faster than ever in the summoning class.\u201cEveryone, stop. Today\u2019s skeleton assembling ends here.\u201dDisappointed voices came out from everywhere. Aaron picked up the roll after returning to the lecture desk.\u201cFinally, I\u2019ll proceed with the participation class. For the students who are called, come forward.\u201dAn inevitable event. It had finally come.Simon gulped.\u2018But maybe I could somehow be overlooked this tim\u2014\u2019\u201cSimon Polentia. Come forward.\u201dHowever, it was an unavoidable role for the Special Admission No.1. Simon stood up with a resigned expression on his face.\u201cDo your best, Simon.\u201dRick cheered while patting Simon on the back.Hector\u2019s group was giggling and laughing from a short distance away.\u201cAnd the next one is\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile everyone was avoiding Aaron\u2019s gaze, Meilyn, seated in the front row, was sticking out her neck.After all, excluding the pressure, a stage where you could appeal to a professor of Kizen was like gold.However\u2026\u201cHector Moore. Come forward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meilyn slouched, pouting her lips in disappointment, and Hector slowly stood from his seat.Just like in the first class, Simon and Hector stood up, facing each other. The assistant placed the skeleton sets in front of them.\u201cWe have about 10 minutes left until the bell rings.\u201dSaid Aaron while looking at his watch. He then searched his pockets, pulled out a cheap-looking necklace, and hung it around the neck of the skeleton model standing in front of the lecture table.\u201cUse the skeleton to get this necklace. Whoever has the necklace at the end of class wins. I forbid you to move on your own or use other dark magic, but everything else is permitted. Then, get ready.\u201dAaron stretched out his arm. The two lowered their posture.\u201cBegin.\u201dSimon and Hector knelt in front of the skeleton set simultaneously.\u2018I can do it!\u2019Simon\u2019s eyes lit up and he pulled out the skull.\u2018I can win in this class!\u2019Simon awakened the undead by flowing the jet black into the magic circle inside the skull.The skull\u2019s eye socket shimmered in black light, making a popping sound as if it was alive.\u2018I\u2019ll assemble the spine at once. From No.2 to No.7\u2026\u2019Simon raised his head and looked at the blackboard. However,The assistant was tearing off the picture of the bone structure that had been pasted on the blackboard with an apologetic face.Aaron said,\u201cCheating isn\u2019t allowed in this match.\u201dSimon bit his lips. Hector\u2019s eyes shook a little like he was flustered, but he quickly turned his head to the skeleton set.Simon also started selecting bones, pulling himself together.\u2018Still, bones have numbers on it. I just have to assemble it step by step in order, starting from No.1!\u2019However,No matter how much he looked at the bones, no numbers were written on its surface.\u201cThe ones you used earlier are sets used for class. The assistants took the trouble to write the numbers one by one. No bone numbers are kindly written on a set of skeletons on the market.\u201dAaron\u2019s calm voice echoed.\u201cI\u2019m sure I said it. If you\u2019re a Necromancer, you should know everything.\u201dIt was like a sky was falling on Simon.Simon glanced at Hector\u2019s side.Hector, who had already completed studying in advance for all subjects, was smoothly assembling the Island Rat Man like he had memorized the order and structure of the bones of it.\u2018Don\u2019t give up. I\u2019ve also completed it once, so the important bone sequences would be in my head.\u2019Simon also found the No.2 neck bone and began to assemble it little by little. Aaron crossed his arms and observed him.\u2018It\u2019s the first time No.1 Special Admission touched a skeleton, huh?\u2019He turned his head and looked at Hector.\u2018On the other hand, that big guy memorized the order and structure. He\u2019s relying on knowledge and memory to assemble it.\u2019Aaron had his own reasons for not showing the bone structure and numbers that were the first class.Of course, in this case, the one who studied in advance would have an overwhelming advantage. But Aaron\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t about who\u2019d win the match.His goal was to find a student who has a flair for Summoning.\u2018Is he Hector? He has some talent.\u2019Although knowledge from studying in advance became the basis, it was his intuition to avoid making mistakes at crucial moments. When two options were conflicting, he was able to choose the correct option with very high probability.\u2018On the other hand, the No.1 special admission\u2026\u2019He was at a loss from the get-go. The order of important bones was wrong, and the overall assembly balance was shaking.Seeing him swapping the bones randomly\u2026 It seemed that he was having a meltdown.He wasn\u2019t really in favor of studying in advance, but you had to prepare well if your skills were poor.\u2018I guess the only student that\u2019s worth scooping in this class is Hector.\u2019Click. Click.Hector\u2019s skeleton stood up, straight, since both its legs were already completed.There was applause everywhere. In particular, the four people who offered to join the faction stood up and chanted Hector\u2019s name.\u2018I\u2019ll win.\u2019Hector began assembling the arms and glanced at Simon.Simon was stuck since the assembling of the torso. He looked like he was completely panicking.\u2018And now that I\u2019m winning, I\u2019ll trample you so thoroughly that you won\u2019t get up again.\u2019Hector finished assembling the right arm. He could go and grab the necklace, but while he was at it, he even started assembling the left arm in order to keep face.\u2018I need to turn him into a joke in this class. I need to break the confidence of being a special admission and drop it to the bottom.\u2019In the blink of an eye, he finished the left arm too.Hector completed a skeleton without even looking at the diagram.Hector\u2019s skeleton began to move. It was a little unstable, but it was definitely taking steps forward.The skeleton that had been circling around Simon, as if provoking him, had picked up the necklace hanging from the model and hung it around its neck.Hector raised his muscular right arm. At the same time, he showed a performance where his skeleton also raised his right arm up too. Students sitting in their seats burst into laughter.\u201cFive minutes left.\u201dAaron\u2019s cold voice was heard.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon was still at a loss assembling the body.Whether it was because he was nervous or conscious of his opponent, the sequence of bones that he seemed to remember had disappeared from his mind.\u2018Calm down.\u2019Simon put down the bones he was holding in his hands.Simon used his instinct or intuition to guess when he couldn\u2019t recall the sequence or numbers of bones he had learned in class.As a result, knowledge and intuition collided and tangled in his head.So Simon decided to give up.\u2018Unless my memory is at the level of a genius, it\u2019s impossible to memorize all the detailed sequences of bones in one lesson.\u2019\u2018Therefore, I\u2019ll give up the knowledge I learned in class.\u2019\u2018This time, I\u2019ll just assemble with my intuition. Make it just the way I want it.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon hit the skeleton that was being assembled with his arm and broke it. Surprised voices could be heard from the room.\u201cDid he give up?\u201d\u201cNo skills, no guts\u2026\u201d\u201cHow is he No.1 special admission?\u201dSimon didn\u2019t pay attention to those sounds. He didn\u2019t want to leave a single trace of regret until the very end within the given time.He lifted the No.1 skull. The sense and habit formed in that short time was unwittingly shouting to grab the No.2 Neckbone.\u2018Make it just the way I want it!\u2019Simon ignored this and connected the No.5, 7, and 10 to the skull one after another.\u201cUh, isn\u2019t that wrong from the start?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dSimon clenched his teeth.There was no reason to necessarily come up with a \u2018correct answer\u2019. Professor Aaron\u2019s instruction was that you just had to raise the skeleton and get the necklace, whatever the method was.\u2018There\u2019s not enough time. I\u2019ll discard difficult structures and simplify them.\u2018Make the forelegs, centering on No.20\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t remove No.27 since it\u2019s the key point. Instead, I\u2019ll take No.29.\u2019Aaron, who was silently watching Simon\u2019s work, widened his eyes.\u2018This is\u2026\u2026!\u2019What Simon was making wasn\u2019t an upright Island Rat Man.But a form of a four-legged beast with both legs and arms on the floor.\u2018Nonsense. It\u2019s absurd, but\u2026!\u2019There was no doubt. It has a similar bone structure to the large rat monster \u2018Gray Rat\u2019 that was said to be found in large cities in the western part of the continent.In fact, it fell within the same biological category and was known as the predecessor of the Island Rat Men.\u2018He\u2019s recreating the rat man\u2019s appearance before evolution by assembling the bones differently?\u2019Of course, the anatomical features, ecology, and internal organs were completely different, so it was impossible to create the same Gray Rat.However, what he was making now was an \u2018undead\u2019, something which worked without needing to follow the rules of living things. It was possible to make bones move with dark magic, whether they fit well or not.\u2018He attached the No.49 tailbone to the chest. That makes sense.\u2019\u2018How does he know that No.11 and No.16 are compatible?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s not acquainted with concepts and knowledge, but with natural insight?\u2019What was being made in front of him right now was a defective product that\u2019s infinitely far from the correct answer that Aaron wanted.Yet,Aaron was feeling a shudder as vast as a sea.\u2018Something\u2019s strange.\u2019On the other hand, Hector also felt that something strange was going on with Simon.With its arms and legs on the floor and its upper body lowered, Simon\u2019s work was a bizarre skeleton that couldn\u2019t be called an Island rat man.But he was certain that something was being built.\u201cWay to go Simon!\u201dCindy Vivace suddenly stood up in the silent classroom and raised her arm.\u201cThe shape is complete! I don\u2019t know what that is, but just complete it!\u201dRick also got up from his seat and shouted without even realising it.The other students looked at Simon\u2019s work with tense expressions. Even Meilyn, the top of Class A, was almost standing.Hector bit his lip.I\u2019m the one who finished the product. I even did it in the shortest time without looking at the diagram.I\u2019m the main character here.But why isn\u2019t everyone looking at me?Hector became nervous.Just like in the first class.\u2018You think I\u2019ll just sit by and let this happen?!\u2019Hector ordered the skeleton. Aaron said that it was forbidden to move directly or use other dark magic, but other actions were allowed.Hector\u2019s skeleton started dashing towards Simon, who was concentrating on assembling and didn\u2019t notice it. A loud shout like, \u201cDodge!\u201d broke loose.Slam!Finally.Hector\u2019s skeleton kicked and smashed Simon\u2019s skeleton.It crumbled down, starting from the torso, and bones scattered in the sky. The students covered their mouths and jumped up from their seats.\u2018I won, Simon Polentia!\u2019Hector smiled triumphantly while sweating profusely.However,\u2018\u2026\u2026Why?\u2019Simon was stretching his right arm with a smile on his face, as if he knew Hector would do that.Something was wrong.Time seemed to slow down endlessly and Hector\u2019s eyes moved in the direction Simon\u2019s right arm was pointing.Among the bones that flew from the kick just now, you could see an arm bone flying in an arc.It flew next to Hector\u2019s skeleton and performed a single simple, yet very precise movement.Rustle.The arm grabbed the necklace the skeleton was wearing and took it off. Then, it fell to the floor like it had lost its strength.Everyone\u2019s jaws dropped.And at the same time\u2026Ring!A clear bell rang to signal the end of class.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a deep silence in the classroom. No one could open their mouths.Even Aaron blankly stared at the arm of the skeleton grabbing the necklace that had fallen to the floor.\u201cT-This is\u2026\u2026 a mistake!\u201dDesperately shouted Hector.\u201cProfessor Aaron! You said to get the necklace with a skeleton! That\u2019s not a skeleton or anything. It\u2019s just a meaningless piece of bone!\u201dPft.Small laughter could be heard.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to where the laughter was heard.Simon, sitting on the floor sweating buckets, raised his head and looked straight at Hector.\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201dWhish!The arm bone holding the necklace flew away as if pulled by a magnet and collided with the collapsed body.Click!Clack!Click!Bone fragments lying on the floor began to stick to the body of the skeleton that had been lying down. The skeleton staggered and stood up, perfectly reconstructing the appearance before it was smashed.Hector\u2019s eyes trembled in disbelief.The skeleton grabbed the necklace and approached Simon. Then, he stood up on his two legs and hung the necklace around Simon\u2019s neck.Staring at Hector\u2019s sour face, Simon smiled.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter who started it.A fierce cheer broke loose in the lecture room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m talking about that No.1 Special Admission that Nefthis personally chose.\u201d\u201cIn my class, he lost 10:1 to his opponent. I still don\u2019t know if he has great talent.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm, that\u2019s surprising. Still, he\u2019s the so-called No.1 Special Admission. Wasn\u2019t there anything special about him?\u201dIt was a persistent question, but Bahil smiled softly.\u201cHe had good physical strength. He stood with nine exhausts in the first class.\u201d\u201cOh, nine times?\u201d\u201cPhysical strength is an important attribute, but it\u2019s a bit vague to be the No.1 Special Admission.\u201dClick.At that moment, the door to the professor\u2019s lounge opened. Aaron, a professor of Summoning, walked in with his disheveled hair and dragged his slippers.He slightly bowed down to the professors and went to pick up his coat hanging from his hanger, as if not caring what other professors were talking about.\u201cThat reminds me.\u201dBahil began to talk.\u201cYou also had a class in Class A today, Aaron.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to Aaron. Aaron grabbed his coat with an expressionless face.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cHow was the No.1 Special Admission for you?\u201dImmediately, all the professors in the lounge looked at Aaron with their eyes shining.A silent pressure was telling him to spit it out already.Aaron sighed quietly, and he answered in his unique drowsy voice.\u201cAn insensitive man of mediocrity. He had some creativity in making his own, original defective products.\u201dWhile the other professors exchanged their thoughts loudly, only Bahil had the corners of his lips massively raised.\u2018Did he just\u2026 put up a smokescreen?\u2019Bahil, who often acted with Aaron on the site, knew his tendency better than anyone. If he really didn\u2019t like the student, he wouldn\u2019t talk in a roundabout way like that.Insensitive man of mediocrity.Creativity in making defective products.In a way, that was the greatest compliment Aaron could give.\u2018\u2026\u2026This is getting more and more appealing.\u2019A boy chosen by Nefthis and marked by that picky Aaron.Bahil felt that his thoughts about Simon came closer and stronger with conviction.\u201cRight, Aaron.\u201dIf so, then the war had already begun.\u201cThe thing you said last year. A declaration that you will no longer have direct disciples. Can I consider that it\u2019s still valid?\u201dAaron, who was about to step out of the room, froze.The other professors also stopped talking and looked at Aaron.Suddenly, there was a strained atmosphere in the lounge.\u201c\u2026P-Professor Bahil.\u201dThe female professor sitting next to Bahil stopped him with a small voice, but Bahil waited for an answer with a smile on his face. As Aaron\u2019s mouth was about to open\u2026Click!\u201cHallo hallo everyone!\u201dA girl with silver hair walked up to the room out of nowhere.\u201cNefthis!\u201dWhen she appeared, the professors of Kaizen, who were said to be bossing the continent around, simultaneously bent their backs and greeted her formally.\u201cWelcome.\u201dBahil, who greeted her like a gentleman, was the first to approach her. Then. he pulled something out of his arms and held it out.It was chocolate ice cream.Bahil was the only person who carried ice cream in a subspace that\u2019d been enchanted with freezing magic in case he met Nefthis in this Kizen.\u201cAgh, honestly! I keep telling you not to treat me like a child!\u201dEven though she said that, she took the ice cream from Bahil\u2019s hand.\u201cIt\u2019s a virtue of a gentleman to prepare snacks for the Lady.\u201d\u201cHmph. What a smooth talker.\u201dNefthis took a bite of the ice cream. Soon, her cheeks flushed, and the expression on her face became soft, like that of a small girl.And some professors who saw her bit the insides of their cheeks. They couldn\u2019t bear the blasphemous thoughts of feeling that the great witch of death was cute.\u201cPlease sit here, Nefthis.\u201dA professor quickly prepared her a seat. Nefthis grabbed the armrests of the slightly bigger chair and climbed onto it while groaning.\u201cHeave-ho! How were the first-year students on the first day?\u201dShe asked while eating her ice cream and the professors scrambled to report what they felt.Rather than the verified special admission students such as Serene or Chatelle, students with excellent grades such as Meilyn and Hector from Class A, or Kaez from Class B were often brought up.Nefthis nodded and listened to their story.\u201cMm, alright, alright! Just tell me if there are any problems. Since today is the first day, go home early and rest.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cNefthis.\u201dIt was then. Aaron, who had been quiet all along, opened his mouth.\u201cI want to talk to you personally for a while.\u201dThe other professors widened their eyes.Of course, counseling with Nefthis was allowed if you were at the level of a professor in Kizen, but it wasn\u2019t common to have such a bold request for individual counseling.\u201cYeah, sure.\u201dNefthis smiled and came down from her seat. Aaron bowed his head once and followed her outside.\u2018He\u2019s so straightforward, as usual\u2026\u2019After Nefthis left, Bahil sat back down and crossed his legs, a smile being brought to his mouth.\u2018But Nefthis won\u2019t tell you that easily, Aaron.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *All classes for the first day of school in Kizen were over.Simon, Rick, and the whole of Class A moved to the dormitory under the guidance of the minion.But a small problem occurred.Because they took the three hours of summoning class to the end, Class A arrived late at the dormitory and most of the rooms were full.The capacity of the dormitory rooms was 3 people per room.Simon and Rick decided to share the same room, but the students who came in earlier occupied more than two slots.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. Even on the 2nd floor, there\u2019s no room with two empty slots.\u201dThe dormitory manager kept on bowing her head. Simon waved dismissively since she was sweating profusely and apologizing even though it wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, manager.\u201dSimon was a little uncomfortable that an older person was treating him respectfully.Of course, within Kizen, the rank of students was higher than the minions. Besides, most of the students were prominent nobles. It was natural for the minions to keep their low profile.Rick folded his arms like he was used to this kind of situation.\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a room with two vacant slots on the 3rd and 4th floors too, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah. The other floors must be in a similar situation.\u201dThe manager showed them the list on the 2nd floor. Some rooms had one slot left, but they were also far apart.Simon and Rick looked at each other.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan, Simon?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s decide after checking the other floors just in case.\u201dAt that moment, when the two were exchanging their opinions\u2026\u201cOutta my way!\u201dWham! There was a bumping sound and the manager collided with the luggage bag, falling to the floor.The brown-haired student who was pulling the cart frowned.\u201cAh, what the hell are you doing? I told you to get out of the way!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201dAs she fell, she quickly bowed her head, and the friend who was accompanying him giggled and laughed. The brown-haired student frowned as he touched the luggage.\u201cAh, dammit. This part is dented because of you. How are you going to pay for this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry my ass. Come after me.\u201dAs she was raising her body, head bowed like a criminal,\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201dSimon came forward.\u201cI\u2019m talking to her right now, you see.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dThe manager\u2019s eyes widened to a circle and the brown-haired student scoffed.\u201cAnd it was pretty obvious that you bumped into her on purpose.\u201dRick sneered and stood next to Simon.\u201c\u2026These bastards must be out of their minds. Who the fuck are you guys to interfere?\u201d\u201cHey, hey, wait!\u201dThe friend next to him hurriedly tapped his shoulder. He then whispered,\u201cIt\u2019s him! The No.1 Special Admission who took the oath as the student representative in the hall!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dThe student\u2019s expression, examining Simon\u2019s face carefully, turned pale.His eyes trembled, as if there was an earthquake, and he panicked. He looked at the innocent manager and said,\u201cH-Hmph! Please be careful next time! Let\u2019s go!\u201dWatching them leave the place like they were running, Rick grabbed his sides and laughed. Simon also smiled and offered his hand to the fallen manager.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dShe blushed, taking Simon\u2019s hand and standing up.\u201c\u2026\u2026T-Thank you for your help.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I just did the right thing.\u201d\u201cMy name is Lena! If you\u2019re planning to check upstairs, I\u2019ll guide you. Maybe I can help.\u201d\u201cAh, please. Thank you!\u201dThe three of them went upstairs together. She moved quickly, getting information from the other managers and headed straight to the 4th floor.\u201cThey said there\u2019s one room with two empty slots on the 4th floor!\u201dLena spoke as she ran. Simon and Rick were running close behind her.\u201cThere\u2019s an empty room?\u201d\u201cYes! How lucky! Room 409 was originally used as a four-person room, so it\u2019s a good large room with a great view, and close to the main stairway! I never imagined that there would be two empty slots there.\u201dSoon, the three of them arrived at the door of Room 409.Lena checked the name tag attached on the room and,\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHer face suddenly darkened.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShe turned, looked at the two of them, and said with a sheepish face,\u201cL-Let\u2019s just go somewhere else. Room 412 and 413 have one slot, but they\u2019re side by side so\u2014\u201d\u201cIs there a problem with this room?\u201dAt Simon\u2019s question, she nodded grimly. She then pointed to the name tag on the door.\u201c\u2026Kajann Edvalt. He\u2019s a student from last year.\u201dRick\u2019s eyes widened at those words.\u201cNo way! This is a first-year dormitory, isn\u2019t it? The second-years arrive next month.\u201d\u201cKajann is a repeater. As far as I know, he was delayed because he caused a big problem and he\u2019s starting from the first year again.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dIt was too strange for Rick to accept.Kizen was a place where they had no hesitation kicking out students.Usually, if they caused problems or they failed, they\u2019d be boldly expelled from school. But repeating? It was a rare case.Simon asked again,\u201cWhat caused his repeating?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a dormitory employee, so I don\u2019t know the specific reason. However, rumors of him spread among the management for causing troubles\u2026\u2026 There were many cases of bruises on the faces of students in the same room or appeals to change rooms.\u201dThere was a reason why two slots were vacant in this room. Rick, slightly frightened, glanced at Simon.\u201cSimon. Let us just go to another roo\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just go and say hello for a moment. That would be fine, right?\u201dAfter saying that, Simon knocked on the door and went inside. Rick freaked out and followed after Simon.As the manager said, it was originally a room for 4, so it was quite spacious. There was a bunk bed and two single beds as well as a personal desk and a wardrobe.Kizen\u2019s buildings, mountains, and valleys could be seen from the window. Indeed, it deserved to be called an ideal spot like Lena mentioned.And on one side of the wall, there was already a person lying on top of the bunk bed with all his luggage unpacked. He was covering his whole body with a white blanket.\u201cWait, Simon!\u201dRick lowered his voice and said,\u201cYou heard what Lena said! He must be temperamental!\u201dSimon took a deep breath and opened his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re sorry to disturb your sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no answer. Simon continued to speak.\u201cWe would like to use this room together. Would that be okay with you?\u201dStill, there was no answer. Lena, who followed in after them, grabbed Simon\u2019s hem while trembling.\u201cL-Let\u2019s just leave, Simon. After all, he\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that moment,Red bloodshot eyes glared at them through the blanket. Rick gulped and Lena stepped back with a frightened look on her face.\u201c\u2026A freshman.\u201dFinally, the blanket was lifted, and a man raised his upper body with a rustling sound.\u201cSo today is the entrance ceremony\u2026 Is it already time for that?\u201dAlthough he was skinny, he had an ideal muscular body and sharp eyes. A clear scar seemed to divide his bloodshot right eye in half. Moreover, he had small scars all over his upper body.A dangerous person.It was everyone\u2019s first impression of him. Rick and Lena grabbed Simon\u2019s arms from each side as he opened his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026No need to be so formal with me. I\u2019m also in the same first year.\u201d\u201cThen uhm\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust call me Kajann.\u201dAs he swept his hair up, you could see his frightening eyes.He had eyes that couldn\u2019t be said to be a teenager\u2019s at all, as if he would immediately grab a knife and stab a person to death.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long you guys will survive in this school, but keep these two things in mind. First, everything I do is none of your business. Second, don\u2019t be loud before I go to sleep. You can dance or sing or do whatever you want after I fall asleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah! So you\u2019re letting us in?\u201d\u201cWhether I let you in or not, since there\u2019s no vacant room, someone will occupy this place eventually.\u201dKajann laid back on the bed and covered himself with the blanket.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Kajann fell asleep, breathing regularly.Simon and Rick exchanged glances and went outside. Lena, who came out last, carefully closed the door.\u201cWe\u2019ll go with this room.\u201dIn the end, the two decided to go with room 409. Lena worriedly asked,\u201cAre you really sure about this?\u201d\u201cYes, we are. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that bad either.\u201dLena nodded and marked the check on the list. Then, she placed their name tags in the case of the front door.\u201cThen I\u2019ll confirm it as room 409! Please let me know if he happens to do something bad on the two of you. I\u2019ll report it to the dorm master immediately to have him take action.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thank you for your concern.\u201dAfter separating from Lena, Simon and Rick started unpacking their luggage in each place. Rick chose a space close to the door, and Simon took a place inside, relatively close to Kajann.There was a noise between them while unpacking their things, but Kajann didn\u2019t wake up. It was like he was dead. Only the tiny sound of breathing could be heard from time to time.\u201cIs he really not gonna wake up?\u201dSuddenly, Rick dared to drop the textbook on the floor.There was a huge\u00a0thud\u00a0on the floor, but Kajann was still dead asleep.\u201c\u2026\u2026He did mention that we can do whatever as long as he\u2019s asleep. I guess he really meant it.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like a bad person.\u201dThe two of them finished unpacking their luggage a lot more comfortably.\u201cSimon! Let\u2019s go take a shower. I saw a public bath on the 2nd floor on the way up.\u201d\u201cA public bath?\u201d* * *This was also Simon\u2019s first time in a public bath.This facility could accommodate more than a hundred people at a time, and it had the floors and walls glittering like gold while hot spring water flowed out of the bath.Simon relieved his fatigue by standing under the stream of water that came out when you pressed the button, and he soaked in the bubbling water.\u201cAh, that was a good one.\u201dOn the way out after bathing,Simon went up the stairs with a languid expression and a towel wrapped around his neck. Rick chuckled.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who gets surprised by a shower cubicle. Have you been living on a mountain or something?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dSimon replied, wiping his wet hair with the towel.\u201cKeke. Still, you should refrain from being in awe saying, \u2018Woah~ Woah~\u2019 while pressing the shower button, you know? Word spreads quickly among the students.\u201d\u201cDid I really do that?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking.\u201dThe two returned to their dorm room.Kajann was still asleep in the same position, as if time had stood still. When he looked out the window, it was pitch-black darkness.As Simon had gotten drowsy after the shower, he lied down on the soft bed.An exclamation came out in spite of himself. It felt like all the happiness in the world seemed to be there.\u201cAghhh. It was good to come to Kizen after all.\u201dHearing that, Rick giggled.\u201cEveryone wants to come to Kizen. Of course, it depends on our grades whether we can stay or not.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are only 300 students in the second-year.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019re still in the student protection period, so the professors are being gentle on us, but in a little while, they\u2019ll start expelling students for poor grades, violations of regulations, or even for being talentless. Life in Kizen is survival.\u201dRick supported the back of his head with his arms and looked up at the ceiling.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to survive even the first-year, you can get into almost anywhere. If you can overcome the crazy competition and become an official graduate, then well\u2026 You\u2019ll become mainstream in the era that moves the continent. Practically everything except being the royal family would be possible. Hm, no. If you\u2019re a graduate of Kizen, maybe a small or medium-sized country might offer you a princess.\u201dSimon giggled.\u201cDo you want to become a noble?\u201d\u201cNot really. Of course, becoming a noble would be comfortable since you won\u2019t be ignored and stuff, but that\u2019s not my ultimate goal.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s your goal?\u201dRick made a coin shape with his finger.\u201cThis.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRick\u2019s expression seemed too complicated to simply be saying, \u2018he wants to make money\u2019.However, Simon decided not to ask further questions since they\u2019d just met for the first time today.While Rick was contemplating for a moment, Simon poured his magic power into the ring on his finger.The ring was dyed in black and Simon pulled the handle. A subspace opened from the floor, and the skeleton set of Island Rat Man came out. It was the class materials that he had bought at Kemmelroad.\u201cOh! What\u2019s that? What was that just now?\u201d\u201cA subspace.\u201dSimon answered briefly and sat down in front of the skeleton set.He opened the case and took out the packed bones. When he examined the surface with his finger and sniffed it, it was clean, like it had been properly disinfected. A bone diagram was also enclosed on the bottom of the case.Rick put on a fed-up face.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re studying again when we just finished the class?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t want to forget the sensation of that moment.\u201dThe battle with Hector in the summoning class.So many things happened all at once that Simon wanted to relive the wonderful sensations of that time once more.He first awakened the undead by pouring jet-black into the magic circle drawn on the skull.Click. Clack.The skull came to life as it hit the jaw and roof of its mouth together.Undead created by summoning magic considered the jet-black user as their master.Simon slowly closed his eyes and raised his assimilation level with the undead. Countless thoughts began to settle in Simon\u2019s mind.\u2018With only my intuition this time too.\u2019Simon picked up bones No.5, No.7, and No.10, and attached them to the skull. It was fun that the bones stuck to themselves when you applied even a small force.He made the spine, formed the torso, and continued on to the legs. Rick watched Simon with his mouth open as Simon put the bones together smoothly.\u201c\u2026\u2026There we go!\u201dAfter 30 minutes, he could recreate the irregular four-legged skeleton he made in class.However, it took a lot of time, unlike in class. The way it walked was also creaky and unnatural, like there was a problem with the legs.It was a matter of concentration and immersion.When he assembled the skeleton in a comfortable space without stress, the results were not as good as during class.Nevertheless, Simon was satisfied that he had restored the product.While stroking the skull of the undead, Simon said,\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe then applied strength to his fingers, knocking the skeleton\u2019s body down.Clatter!The bones that had been assembled scattered all over the place and went into different places like the bed, the desk, by the window, and in the closet. Rick said in surprise,\u201cWhat? Why did you do that? What a waste after making it\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon closed his eyes and raised his concentration. Sweat trickled down from his clean, washed hair again.Skeletons formed by summoning magic had a tendency to restore their former bodies. It was officially called the \u2018restoring force\u2019, but, in the field, it was also known as \u2018attraction\u2019.Simon felt the jet-black contained in the 53 bones scattered throughout the room.\u2018Restore!\u2019When Simon opened his eyes, the bones scattered throughout the room flew all at once and began to attach themselves to the skeleton\u2019s body.It took 30 minutes to make it at first, but it only took 15 seconds to reassemble and return to its original shape.Simon let out his held breath and opened his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026It\u2019s hella amazing, even when seeing it again.\u201dMumbled Rick, smirking.After the restoration, the skeleton approached and rubbed its head on Simon\u2019s leg and fawned. Simon also smiled and stroked the undead.While he was at it, he started assembling the standard Island Rat Man skeleton shown in the diagram.Rather than simply looking at the diagram and following the numbers, he wrote down on his notebook what he realized while examining and thinking on his own. Why the No.11 bone had to come after the No.10. Why the assembly order the was way it was.This order has been the standard used by necromancers for a long time. But it must have taken a lot of trial error to get to this point.Every action had a reason and meaning behind it. Every time he realized that, he was thrilled, and he felt grateful for his predecessors\u2019 knowledge and hard work.Simon tried swapping bones No.25 and No.31.\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201dSimon did several experiments. The skeleton that had been moving its arm shook his head with a rattling sound.He realized that some arrangements were more effective for undead to move, even if there were more rational choices in terms of the human body structure.\u201c\u2026\u2026Mmmmm.\u201dRick, who had been dozing for a while, rubbed his eyes and got up.\u201cYou\u2019re still at it? Guess you really got interested in Summoning.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fun.\u201dSimon put a smile on his face.\u201cI already can\u2019t wait for the next session.\u201dRick yawned and went into bed, but Simon\u2019s night wasn\u2019t over yet. He pulled out the book, \u2018Introduction to Summoning\u2019, and started researching.\u2018The basics of the undead.\u2019Simon was still thirsty.The skeletons that my father used to help the people in my territory.The skeletons Lorain used to suppress the gangs.I wonder what I\u2019m lacking compared to those two.Click!Clack!Rattle.He kept on reassembling it while continuing to study. The skeleton restored in 15 seconds could now be restored within 10.But this time, something was different. A dark blue jet-black arose from the eyes of Simon\u2019s skeleton, which had been reassembled more than 70 times.This was something that didn\u2019t happen, even during the class.Swaaa\u2026The skeleton with burning eyes moved its head and looked at Simon.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon also made eye contact with the skeleton.Simon\u2019s first day of school continued like that until late at night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next morning, Simon\u2019s new day at Kizen had begun.They had three classes scheduled for today.Professor Eric Aura, who was in charge of the first class, Epidemiology of Jet-Black, was a middle-aged man.A neat beard, ideally positioned wrinkles, a dignified look that went well with a suit, and a laid-back attitude that came with age. Everyone liked him.\u201cJet-black is fundamental for Necromancers. Its importance cannot be overemphasized.Eric skillfully led the students.Easy to understand explanations and catchy interpretations. Although he had no flashy technique like Bahil of Curses, the class itself was neat and simple.Everyone in Class A was engrossed in Eric\u2019s lecture in no time.How jet-black created the miracle known as dark magic.The flow of jet-black.Understanding of the runes.And the working principle of the magic circle.\u201cThe origin of the rune can be found in the \u2018Eternally Burning Torch\u2019 in the Temple of Dell.\u201dEric did more than just explain the theory.\u201cPeople never questioned why the torch never extinguished. They considered the act of doubting God\u2019s miracles blasphemous.\u201dAt times, he even used history to explain the runes.\u201cEventually, they noticed that the ashes that had fallen from the torch took the form of some kind of letter. And they were shocked at the truth that nothing but letters were performing a miracle like the burning torch. This is the origin of the rune.\u201dEric drew the ancient runes on the blackboard and explained how the mages and necromancers researching them had improved the runes.Then, he smoothly moved to the solving of modern magic circles.Why does this magic circle work?And why doesn\u2019t this magic circle work?Eric carefully disassembled the magic circle and explained it. Up until now, Simon drew a magic circle with the rectifying tool without much thought, but now, he somehow realized how it worked.While Simon was taking notes and catching up with the class, the bell rang, announcing the end of class.\u201cWe\u2019ll end here for today.\u201dEric also announced the end of class.\u201cI have a task for you till the next class. Please take the magic circle you learnt as an example that doesn\u2019t work. Write down the correction method, calculation formula, and the formula fixed till it works, and submit it to the next class. The three people I\u2019ll call will come up to the front and present it in person.\u201dMaybe because epidemiology of jet-black was a required major class, fortunately, Simon wasn\u2019t called in front this time.Simon uttered yells of delight in his head.\u201cGah! This class is so hard.\u201dAmong the students leaving the classroom boisterously, Rick stretched his arms with an exhausted expression on his face.\u201cIt felt like I was studying arithmetic with my dad back in the day. Can\u2019t I just memorize the magic circle and use it just like normal? Why do I have to know all the details of invoking principles?\u201d\u201cIt was fine for me.\u201dArms crossed, Simon replied,\u201cI didn\u2019t understand half of it, but I liked how he explained it step-by-step from the beginning.\u201d\u201cYou like it as long as it\u2019s from Kizen. You even scratched the soap in the bath with your nail because it was interesti\u2014\u201dSimon hit Rick\u2019s chest with his elbow. He stepped back, saying, \u2018Ugh!\u2019 but even in the midst of that, the burst of laughter didn\u2019t stop.\u201cHah! Getting scared of the bubbles coming out from the bathtub pfft! \u2018Can I really go in here?\u2019 Pfffffft!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going ahead.\u201dSimon answered sulkily and walked first. Rick quickly followed after him, saying he was joking.Class A had to prepare for the next class right away without a break.After walking on foot for 20 minutes, they arrived at the location where the next class would be held. It was in the outskirts of Kizen, a plain, empty field.\u201cNo one\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cHuh? Over there\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhile the students of Class A were waiting while chatting, a cloud of thick dust was rising from the forest.Rrrrrrrumble!The ground shook as if an earthquake had occurred.What was approaching was none other than a herd of many dozens of hippos.The students stepped back while screaming in surprise.\u201cAhaha! Hello, new students!\u201dThen a man was seen riding on a hippopotamus.He had dark skin, thick lips, a slender body, was dressed in short sleeves and shorts, and was barefoot. He skilfully stopped the herd of hippos in front of the students and jumped off.\u201cProfessor Hong Feng has decided that today\u2019s class location would be Mountain Roke! Now, please get on the hippo!\u201dProfessor Hong Feng Tun Sokum Marerat, professor of Combat Magic, was a well-known freak in Kizen.Kizen provided her laboratory and home, but she spent her days wandering and camping on Roke island. Due to her tendencies, most of her Combat Magic classes were also outdoor classes.\u201c\u2026Are you telling us to ride on that right now?\u201dA male student put up a disgusted expression on his face looking at the hippos standing with their nostrils flaring.\u201cHey, minion! Don\u2019t you at least have to put a rug on that beast?\u201dHearing this, the man approached the student with a smile.And,\u201cAh! Aaaaaaaaagh!\u201dHe grabbed the student\u2019s face with one hand and lifted him up. A few surprised voices came out.\u201cWh-What do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\u201cHow dare you! We\u2019re the students of Kizen!\u201dA thick killing intent flowed out from the body of the man who was smiling innocently. The students who came to protest stopped in their tracks.\u201cWhy are the freshmen these days so disrespectful? It\u2019s supposed to be an assistant teacher, not a minion. Right?\u201dThe male student who grasped the situation only then hurriedly shouted,\u201cAagh! I-I\u2019m sorry, Senior!\u201dIf it was an assistant teacher, there was a high probability that he was a senior who had previously attended Kizen.Moreover, as they were the closest person who assisted the professor, they definitely weren\u2019t a person that a freshman could look down on.\u201cIt\u2019s not senior, but assistant teacher.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, assistant teacher!\u201dSeeing a huge commotion, Simon shook his head.\u201cWhy the hell are they doing that?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re nobles, after all.\u201dRick shrugged his shoulders and followed up on Simon\u2019s words.\u201cSince they grew up in a sheltered environment, they still have the habit of dealing with others as if they\u2019re their servants. This kind of situation will frequently happen at the beginning of the school term.\u201d\u201cAlright, we\u2019re running a little late. Everyone, please get on the hippo! Up to three people can ride on one hippo!\u201dThe students got on the hippo with a lot more hurried movements.Simon got on in one go with a skillful movement, followed by Rick slipping and whining a few times before finally getting on.\u201cPhew. The class hasn\u2019t even started yet, but it\u2019s already tough.\u201dBehind Rick wiping his sweat off with his sleeve,Simon saw a flustered female student hopping in place.\u201cEveryone onboard? Then we\u2019ll start going now!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The girl put on an urgent face when she heard the assistant. Simon willingly extended his hand towards her.\u201cDo you need help?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! Thank you.\u201dShe approached Simon looking like she\u2019d seen a benevolent being and took Simon\u2019s hand.As Simon pulled her with enough strength, her body was drawn like a paper doll, climbing onto the hippo\u2019s back at once.\u201cAlright, we\u2019re leaving now!\u201dAs soon as the female student came up, the assistant kicked the hippo\u2019s hip. The leading hippo started running with a roar, and the rest of the hippos ran in unison after the leading hippo.She sighed in relief as she was almost left behind and turned to Simon.\u201cThank you for helping! I\u2019m\u2014!\u201dShe was about to say something, but the sudden increase in the hippo\u2019s running speed interrupted the conversation. The other students also stuck to the hippos\u2019 backs in fright.The feeling of vibrations coming up all over the body made the riding not that comfortable.One student shouted out,\u201cA-Assistant teacher, I think I might fall! What should I hold on to?\u201d\u201cAnything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too fast!\u201d\u201cPersistence! Overcome with persistence! This is also part of training!\u201dSaid the assistant teacher while balancing with only two legs, raising his right arm.\u201cOf course, if you fall right now and get trampled on by a herd of hippos, you would die, right? I mean, one or two accidents happen every year, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dThe students couldn\u2019t believe what they\u2019d just heard.\u201cHold on! Hold on! Students who can\u2019t even ride a hippo properly aren\u2019t needed in Kizen!\u201d\u201cUwah! Uwaaaaaaagh!\u201d\u201cMamaaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cHey, stop this! Fucking stop this right now!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahaha!\u201dIt was indeed a crazy outdoor class.* * *They finally arrived at the location where the class would be held.They passed through the thickly grown trees, into a place where an open field spread out in the middle of the mountain. The sun was floating in the middle of the forest like it was welcoming everyone, and the chirping of birds and the sounds of insects played out harmoniously like an orchestra.It was an incredibly beautiful place.\u201cHufff\u2026 Huff\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, Huuuuuuuugh\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, that was only if the people were ready to appreciate the scenery.All the students were lying on the field with exhausted faces. The hippos went back down the mountain and the assistants handed out water bottles to the students lying around.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019It had a very strange flavor when Simon drank it.A drink with a sweet but slightly spicy aftertaste. But as soon as he drank it, his thirst was quenched and fatigue was relieved. The other students\u2019 expressions became more and more comfortable little by little.Flap flap!This time, a flock of white birds flew in and began to pass over the students\u2019 heads. Everyone blinked and stared at them.\u201cWelcome to my class, everyone.\u201dSimon turned his head. Beyond the flocks of soaring birds, a tall woman walked towards them with her arms outstretched.Healthy tan skin and a strong body with muscles exposed. Her hair was an unusual style, several layers tied by some kind of string.The students got off their butts.\u2018So that person is\u2026\u2026\u2019Hong Feng Tun Sokum Marerat.She was a legend in the world of necromancy who achieved a dramatic victory by breaking 100 necks in five days fighting alone against the super-larged undead monster \u2018Kundar Hydra\u2019 that devastated four territories.After that battle, Hong Feng was scouted by Kizen and taught Combat Magic to this day.She was a freak, but her skills were unquestionable, so her eccentricity was overlooked by the school.Flap!Forest birds flew and sat on her outstretched finger.\u201cThen, everyone, please stand up.\u201dShe used a slurred pronunciation that seemed slightly out of line with the official language.\u201cPlease gather up in four columns.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhen the students were spacing out from not being able to understand her, Hong Feng\u2019s assistants approached them and spoke like they were used to this situation.\u201cPlease gather up in four columns.\u201d\u201cQuickly.\u201dThe students lined up with puzzled looks on their faces. Hong Feng was at the front, and the assistant teachers were at the left and right of the students\u2019 lines.\u201cThen, we\u2019ll depart now.\u201dI mean, when are we gonna begin the class then?As soon as Simon thought that, Hong Feng started running forward. An unexpected running session started as the students in front also ran after her in a hurry.\u201cA healthy mind dwells in a healthy body! The basics of combat magic requires strong physical strength!\u201dHer tone was slurred like she had just learned the continental language, but what she was trying to say was pretty clear.As she increased her speed, the leading students also struggled to increase their speeds.And Simon, who was running in the third row, looked at her body in admiration.\u2018That\u2019s amazing.\u2019I\u2019ve never seen anyone run like that.The angle of the feet, the movement of the muscles, and the shaking of the shoulders and upper body while running. It was like a perfect, goosebump-inducing painting.She ran with the same arms and legs, but why did she feel like an alien from another dimension? It was so ideal that a sense of difference was felt.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201cHuuuuuh! Huuuh!\u201dWhile everyone was running frantically, Hong Feng started her lecture while slightly slowing down the running pace.The fundamentals, mindset, and significance of combat magic.To sum it up, Combat Magic was a class to learn combat techniques by wrapping your body with jet-black to strengthen it to the extreme and then using it to fight.If you reached a certain level of combat magic, you could wear a \u2018black robe\u2019 in which silk-like jet-black oozed out of your body to form a garment. It was like a symbol of battle among necromancers.It was a dream of many male students to use this skill, and there were many cases where they chose to major in Combat Magic for the sake of the black robe.\u201cThere are a lot of trees. Be careful!\u201dThe run continued over the thicket and dense forest terrain. As the 4 lines collapsed, everyone began to follow Hong Feng in their own way, avoiding the trees.While most of them rushed through the bushes, a few students even climbed up and jumped on through tree branches.All of those were aspirants of combat magic. They were showing off their forte as if waiting for it.One of the assistants jumped up to the tree and gave them a thumbs up. The faces of the aspirants brightened up.\u201cWhew! I envy those combat guys.\u201dGrumbled Rick as he was hit in the face by a branch of a tree.\u201cHmm.\u201dSimon was observing them carefully.He could feel himself getting interested in a dark magic specializing in combat that uses the body.\u201cUhugh! Huuff! Hey Simon! You doing fine?\u201dAsked Rick, face red. Simon blinked and answered,\u201cHm? Ah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cHufff! Huugh! What kind of physical strength do you\u2014! Cough cough!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone do this much running?\u201dIt was Simon who ran around all over the rugged southern mountains of Les Hill like it was a neighborhood trail.While sweat beads appeared on the assistants\u2019 foreheads, Simon\u2019s expression was as comfortable as ever.\u2018This class is fun too!\u2019While Simon was enjoying being in his element, Hong Feng watched him, her eyes shining.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You just need to get the hang of it. It\u2019s just like forming jet-black on your palms, but this time with the soles of your feet.\u201dShe jumped into the air, as if demonstrating.Black mist exploded under her feet, a boom sounding out, and she made double, even triple jumps in the air. Sounds of admiration broke loose from everywhere.\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to leap in the air.\u201dShe said as she landed back on the ground while rolling.\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re about to jump, shoot the jet black that you have gathered on your feet. It\u2019s like jumping by stepping on the jet black.\u201dHong Feng, at the front, ran past the students and leapt off the ground.With a\u00a0swish, she flew a few meters and easily crossed the valley, landing on the opposite side.\u201cCome!\u201dShe smiled while waving her arm. The thoughts of the student after her became more complicated.The valley\u2019s depth wasn\u2019t that deep, but no one wanted to become a laughing stock by falling into a valley at the beginning of the school term.The students who needed more time to motivate themselves slowed down, and the confident ones ran forward screaming.\u201cHryaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dSwish!They jumped.You could see a slight black mist flowing from all their feet.Three of the five landed nicely on the ground, one tumbled down on the ground, and the other, who lacked the jumping strength, barely reached out and grabbed the edge of the cliff.\u201cWell done!\u201dHong Feng came up to him and took him by the hand. The boy smiled awkwardly and climbed up the cliff.\u201cYour timing on releasing the jet-black was a bit late. Try releasing it faster next time!\u201d\u201cThank you, professor!\u201dAfterward, other students also jumped off the ground. As expected from the Kizen enrollees, around 20 jumped, and they all succeeded. Simon, who was watching from the back, got a little nervous.\u2018Like jumping by stepping on the jet-black, Jumping by stepping on the jet-black\u2026\u2026\u2019\u201cYou seem to be overthinking, aren\u2019t you, Simon?\u201dRick calmly wagged his finger.\u201cI\u2019ll go ahead!\u201dHe turned his back and ran. Then, he stamped on the ground, both his knees pressed to his chest, and he flew powerfully into the air.\u201cWooow!\u201dThe corner of Rick\u2019s lips rose at the cheers of the girls. But the cheers weren\u2019t directed towards him.When Rick raised his head, Hector spun his body a meter above him.Woooosh!He then put his feet on the ground and slid down.Even the landing was perfect.\u201cWell done!\u201dHong Feng gave a bright smile and a thumbs up.Hector also raised his thumb and ended with a polite bow.\u201cNice, Hector!\u201d\u201cAs expected!\u201dThen, he high-fived with his faction members that had jumped before him.\u201c\u2026In any case, I just don\u2019t like him.\u201dMurmured Rick, who had failed the landing and buried his face in the dirt.\u201cWooooah!\u201dAt that moment, a second cheer broke out from behind.Rick and Hector turned around in surprise.\u2018What the\u2026\u2026?!\u2019He flew.Simon was soaring in the air with both soles of his feet facing the sky. Shortly, his back was bent and his legs went down, scratching the ground, back turned to them.Woooosh!His body passed Rick and Hector and stopped right in front of a nearby rock.\u201cExcellent!\u201dHong Feng clapped her hands in delight.\u2018This bastard\u2026\u2026\u2019Hector\u2019s facial muscles wrinkled severely. Simon bowed to Hong Feng and returned to the students.Rick, acting cool by leaning his back against a tree before anyone noticed, put his palm up.Simon grinned and high-fived him loudly.\u2018He\u2019s starting to act like a No.1 Special Admission now.\u2019\u2018Was he planning to major in Combat Magic?\u2019The students murmured as they talked about Simon, and Hector\u2019s expression stiffened more and more. It was evident that his plans were going awry.\u201cNow, the other students, jump!\u201dUnlike how they hesitated at first, most of the students succeeded, and only two in the class failed. However, the assistants secretly waiting in the valley caught them, so they avoided drowning.\u201cMmmm.\u201dRick opened his notebook and was writing something down. Simon asked him, curious,\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201cRecruitment list for the group class. It\u2019ll be starting next week, so we need to start preparing.\u201dThe book was filled with the names of the Class A students to pay attention to, the subjects they\u2019re good at, their personalities, and more.To Simon, Rick was somehow different from the other students.Normally, it would be difficult to even take care of yourself catching up with the class, but looking at Rick, he was busy observing others.\u201cHow\u2019s the investigation so far?\u201d\u201cIn general, the class standard is high. They\u2019re all pretty good. However\u2026\u201dRick closed the notebook and shrugged.\u201cShe\u2019s kinda meh. It feels like she\u2019ll be dropped soon after the protection period is over.\u201dSimon looked in the direction Rick was looking. The girl who rode the hippo thanks to Simon was coming up in the arms of the assistant.\u201cEveryone\u2019s here, right? Then let\u2019s move to the next area!\u201dWhen all the students came up, Hong Feng started running again without a moment to breathe. The students also ran after her in surprise.\u2018Haha! What\u2019s this?\u2019It was different from the classes which stayed only in the classroom. The class felt really dynamic.After running for 20 minutes and getting out of the forest, an open hill stretched out. There was a slight incline, so it was easy to speed up.The moment when everyone was following Hong Feng\u2026Dududududududu!The same thing that happened just a few hours ago was happening.The hippos that had transferred the students came up the slope from the other side.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re coming to this side, Pr-Professor?!\u201dBut Hong Feng had disappeared all of a sudden. The same was true for other assistant teachers.The students paused in bewilderment, but the approaching herd of hippos seemed unwilling to slow down.\u2018This is dangerous!\u2019Simon also stopped walking and focused on his eyes. A hippo was running right in front of him, trying to ram him.\u2018The feeling of stepping on the jet-black!\u2019Pow!Simon soared into the sky and the herd of hippos passed beneath him, raising up a cloud of dust. Several other students near him were also floating in the air like Simon.\u2018I\u2019m falling!\u2019Simon tilted his body and landed as far away as possible, to where there were no hippos.As soon as he came down, he frantically rolled on the ground and had to dodge the hippos.\u201cKugh!\u201dThere were two more right in front of him.Simon raised his body and slammed hard on the ground, jumping a hair\u2019s width before they reached him.\u2018I-I almost died.\u2019The fear of death brought goosebumps to his body and made him shiver.Simon looked back with a cold sweat.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me this is also part of the class? At this rate, people will\u2014!\u2019Simon\u2019s eyes widened as he looked back. He thought total chaos would\u2019ve erupted, but the situation was pretty far from that.A female student built a wall in front of her by tripping hippos with the exhaust curse.A male student dug into the floor with dark magic and laid down in it.Other than that, there were students riding on hippos and roaring relaxedly, and students who shaped their jet-black like a rope and evacuated to the top of a tree.Everyone was escaping the crisis in their own way.\u201cKyahahahahaha!\u201dCindy Vivace was floating in the sky with Necromancy. Only then did Simon realize,\u2018I\u2019m not in a position to worry about anyone right now.\u2019It was indeed an unnecessary worry. And Simon had to compete with 1,000 of these kinds of students.\u201cYou alright, Simon?\u201dRick, who had been climbing up on a pole made of jet-black, came down, saying, \u2018heave-ho\u2019.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. All of those hippos are under professor Hong Feng\u2019s control. Some students fell, but the hippos were just avoiding them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh, really?\u201dThe fact that Hong Feng could use combat dark magic and the power of the druid family was pretty common knowledge.At that moment, the assistants who came down from the sky shouted while clapping their hands,\u201cNow, now, there\u2019s no time to sit around carelessly! Stand up!\u201d\u201cIn a little while, the hippos will take a turn and come down again! Everyone, stand up!\u201dWhen the students heard the word hippo, they got up in fright. The assistant pointed below and said,\u201cThe professor is already waiting down there! We\u2019ll depart right away!\u201dThe sprint began once more.As they passed through the dense trees, a picturesque mountain with colorful flowers was revealed and they could see Hong Feng waving on the flat terrain below.\u201cThere are no obstacles any more! Let\u2019s go to the professor at full speed!\u201d\u201cWhaaaaaah!\u201dThe students shouted a cheer of joy and went down the flowered hill. Simon and Rick also ran down the slope in excitement.The wind coming from the other side blew away the sweat refreshingly. Dandelion seeds in the field swayed in the wind, and the leaves fell down while dancing. Simon came down the hill with a strange sense of freedom.\u201cGreat work! We\u2019ll now take a break!\u201dShouted Hong Feng.The students sat on the floor as if on cue, and the assistant teachers were distributing drinks to the students.Their nervousness was relieved and laughter broke loose from everywhere. Thrilled students were eager to retell their heroic deeds from before.\u201cHuh? Look over there!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s food!\u201dWhile resting, Kizen\u2019s minions arrived with a food truck. Everyone\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou\u2019re actually supposed to eat after the class, but I thought you guys consumed a lot of physical strength, so I contacted Kizen in advance. Is that alright?\u201d\u201cKyaaaah!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the best, professor!\u201dNext up was the time for a meal.The menu was a high-protein diet that consisted mostly of meat.The taste of Kizen\u2019s food was famous to begin with and their serving size was generous. They even had soy meat for vegetarians.Everyone got their food, sat on the grass with a beautiful view, and enjoyed eating while looking at the mountains and lakes.Simon and Rick also sat under the shade of the tree. Maybe because it was an outdoor meal after exercising, the taste of the meal was incredibly delicious.\u201cWow. There\u2019s no other professor like this.\u201dWithout him knowing, Rick, just like the other students, was praising the Combat Magic class, as if he had fallen for the charm of it.\u201cUsing her own class time to feed her students. It\u2019s an impossible thing to happen in that strict Kizen.\u201dSimon smiled and nodded in agreement.\u201cBut it\u2019s a little different from what I heard.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cI heard that professor Hong Feng is actually a very Kizen-like professor.\u201dRick\u2019s face looked like he was wondering what the hell Simon was saying.\u201cThat pure water and natural-like person, professor Hong Feng is? Nahh. I don\u2019t know where you got that information from, but it\u2019s total nonsense, nonsense.\u201dSimon blinked. It was something he heard directly from Lorain.Clap clap.Hong Feng clapped her hands and got the attention of the students.\u201cStudents, finish it up. We\u2019ll be leaving again in 10 minutes.\u201dHearing those words, the assistant teachers jumped up to their feet and shouted,\u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving in 10 minutes!\u201d\u201cFinish your meal and get ready!\u201dThe assistant teachers went around to spread Hong Feng\u2019s words.The students, who had been leisurely relaxed, began to arrange their plates and loosen themselves.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this again?\u201d\u201cI thought we\u2019d go back, riding a hippo, after resting like this.\u201dThe students gathered while murmuring. As Simon watched the assistants busily moving, he thought,\u2018I think this is where it\u2019ll really begin.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen all the students gathered and lined up, the assistant teachers approached. Then, they hung a plain, featureless white bracelet directly on the students\u2019 arms.It was pretty heavy when Simon moved his arm.\u201cPlease flow the jet-black into your bracelets.\u201d\u201cHuuff!\u201d\u201cWh-What\u2019s this?\u201dThe students\u2019 bodies suddenly bent down.\u201cYou guys are all familiar with the exhaust curse, right?\u201dHong Feng smiled, putting her hand on her hips.\u201cThe next course is over there.\u201dShe pointed to the steep hill where the students had come from. At the top of the hill, the assistant teacher waved his hand, a flag fixed on the ground.\u201cYou\u2019re going to the top of the hill with an exhaust curse on you.\u201dThe faces of the students all turned pale.\u2018Wow, shit\u2026 Wait a minute\u2026\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t this too much?\u2019But no one dared to protest against the professor of Kizen. Hong Feng gave a radiant look.\u201cPlease prepare right away. I\u2019ll check who\u2019s dropping out of the line.\u201dOnly then did students grasp the situation and stand at the starting line with serious faces. Simon was already sweating profusely behind them. It was difficult enough to reach the start line with the curse on, and he was worried about whether he\u2019d be able to climb that steep hill.\u201cAlright. Then, go!\u201dOn cue with Hong Feng\u2019s shout, all the students in Class A rushed out.At first, everyone stood up and walked for dignity, even though the curse was heavy, but there were no exceptions as the incline got steeper and steeper from the middle part. Both commoners and nobles alike had to crawl while lying on the dirt.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201d\u201cKuuugh!\u201dPainful breaths and moans broke loose from everywhere. Their whole bodies were covered in dirt, but they had to keep on moving forward since Hong Feng and her assistants were watching.\u2018Phewww\u2026\u2019Simon touched the ground with his bloody hands torn by the rocks and inched forward.Every step was heavy. His vision was spinning and the sky turned yellow.\u2018I\u2019ll finish, no matter what.\u2019Studying in advance or whatever. This was the area of pure physical strength and will.If I fall behind other peers from here, I won\u2019t be able to catch up with them in the future either.Simon somehow squeezed his strength out and climbed up while others were resting. He made his own pace and didn\u2019t compromise on maintaining it.Tremble tremble.His arms trembled beyond the control of his brain, but he moved, trying his best.He could see the end. The assistant teacher and Hong Feng were standing where the flag marking the end was waving.\u2018Just a little bit more!\u2019Simon was in the lead. Although he wasn\u2019t far from Rick and the other runners below, Simon was definitely ahead of the other Class A students.But there was someone next to him.Hector was climbing the hill at about the same pace as Simon.\u2018\u2026\u2026Dammit. So it\u2019s you again.\u2019Hector looked at Simon while grinding his teeth.He was getting sick of Simon. Simon kept on being an eyesore for him since the first class.What was worse was that Hector was climbing up by reducing the effect of the curse of exhaust in his own way, yet Simon was equal to him while climbing up using his bare body, without using such tricks.At this point, his pride didn\u2019t let him lose. Hector also exploded his fighting will.The slope of the hill became steeper as the flag got closer. The two, who\u2019d place 1st and 2nd, increased their pace and distanced themselves from the runners below.\u201cHang in there!\u201dHong Feng clenched her fists and shouted. The assistant teachers also clapped and cheered.\u2018I\u2019ll be the 1st!\u2019\u2018I\u2019m going to be the 1st!\u2019At that moment when Simon and Hector stretched out their arms,Step.Above their arms, someone walked, standing straight.Unlike the two of them, who were all covered in dirt, a girl with light blue hair passed by with her skirt fluttering and walking with a gentle gait.1st of Class A, Meilyn Vilenne.She was the first to step to the top of the hill.\u201cCongratulations. You\u2019re the 1st.\u201d\u201cThank you, professor.\u201dThe assistant teacher standing next to her ticked her name on the list. Simon and Hector paused for a moment as they were gawking out.\u201cHow did you do that?\u201dMeilyn raised her head and answered Hong Feng\u2019s question.\u201cI climbed up after breaking the curse by calculating the resistance formula.\u201dHearing this, Simon felt as if he\u2019d been hit in the head with a hammer.To think that you could just lift the curse instead of struggling with all your might?!\u201cWell done. Go ahead and rest.\u201dMeilyn, who politely received the drink from the assistant teacher, sat in the shade of a tree and leaned back.This time again, 1st place was hers.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cProfessor Hong Feng!\u201dThen an assistant teacher came up from the bottom of the hill.\u201cThere\u2019s an injured person! I think he hurt his ankle a little.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go check it out.\u201dShe gleaned back towards Simon and Hector and followed the assistant down the hill.\u201c\u2026Hah, I can\u2019t believe this.\u201dAnd as soon as Hong Feng had disappeared, Hector, who finally ended up completely lifting the curse, got up. Simon\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.Tap. Tap.Hector strode up the hill and reached the top. As he was registered as 2nd place, he took the drink and looked at Meilyn.\u201cHey, you.\u201dShe turned her head.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing lifting the curse and climbing in a Combat Magic class? Do you think I\u2019ve been through this because I can\u2019t do that?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dMeilyn snorted and acted like it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201cBut then again, why would a young lady who was caged up inside the Ivory Tower understand the ways of the world?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time, her eyebrows twitched.\u201cAre you picking a fight with me right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speaking the truth, not picking a fight. In any case, they can\u2019t evaluate our grades during the student protection period. The key here is to appeal to the professor with a sincere class attitude. The foolish act you just did would never score anything towards her.\u201dHer eyes turned ferocious.\u201cYou have such a distorted personality. Why are you provoking someone who hasn\u2019t done anything? Was ranking 2nd that frustrating?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just telling you not to ruin the class of Class A. And let me make this clear. I don\u2019t give a shit about someone like you.\u201dHector said so and turned his head. Simon was just climbing up to the high ground while whimpering. The assistant teacher smiled and handed him the drink.\u201cSimon Polentia, you ranked 3rd.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you.\u201dSimon staggered and sat down in front of the shade of a tree out of his extreme exhaustion. He then gulped down the drink.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn and Hector\u2019s attention lingered on him for a moment.The three of them held their breath together in the shade of a tree, not saying a word for a while.* * *As time passed, the students came up to the high ground one by one.Even those students who had difficulty in climbing hills due to lack of stamina were able to climb up slowly since the effectiveness of the curse began to decrease as time went by.\u201cI-I think I\u2019m going to die, Simon.\u201dRick also got pretty high results, but after a while, he joined the group of students vomiting from afar. Simon also went and patted him on the back.Most of the students made it to the top except for those few people who showed signs of exhaustion, but the fatigue accumulated from this class was enormous.When all the students were lying down, unable to lift a finger, Simon felt at a loss as to how to get back to Kizen. Half of Class A would likely fall behind if they had to ride the hippos again.But fortunately, Hong Feng contacted Kizen and was given permission to use the simple teleportation magic circle.\u201cWoaaah!\u201dA magic circle spread out in the area where they had the class, and all you had to do was step on the magic circle to arrive at Kizen. The minions who brought the meal also came using this method.The students were greatly relieved and headed to Kizen with the magic circle. Simon, waiting in line with Rick, also walked through the magic circle.Whirrr!The brilliant ink emitted from the magic circle wrapped around Simon\u2019s body.The moment when the teleportation was about to happen and he felt the sensation of both legs rising\u2026There was a huge thud!He felt like something was blocked. Simon fell to the ground in pain, like he had hit a wall.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dWhen he looked up, the surrounding environment around him had also changed.Simon was alone in a small hut, while Rick, who had walked through the magic circle together with him, was nowhere to be seen.\u2018This isn\u2019t Kizen\u2026\u2026 right?\u2019Simon stood up.It had a familiar atmosphere, similar to the house he had previously lived in at Les Hill. It\u2019s just that the hut was smaller and had a wilder feeling here.The walls and the floors had unprocessed rough wood grains. There were also hammocks instead of beds and animal skins instead of carpets. And on one side of the wall, you could see salted meat being dried in the sun.Click.The door of the hut opened, and a tall woman entered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to startle you, Simon.\u201d\u201cProfessor Hong Feng!\u201dShe smiled and offered Simon a seat.Simon sat down on the chair with a puzzled look, and she brought out some tea. She then briefly explained the whole story.There was some suspicious formula in the teleport magic circle, so she assigned the assistants to investigate it. There was a formula that sent a person to another place by resonating with their unique jet black. And the target of that formula\u2026Was Simon.\u201cDo you have any idea who would do this?\u201dSimon, who had no clue at all, shook his head.Hong Feng folded her arms.\u201cHmm.\u201dUnlike Simon, it looked like she had a guess.\u201cSo, I interfered with the magic circle and turned the coordinates towards my house.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also my role to protect the students from unknown threats. And\u2026\u201dHer eyes sparkled.\u201cActually, I also wanted to talk with just the two of us, Simon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Me?\u201d\u201cOriginally, it\u2019s against the rules to have contact with students during the protection period, but it seems like there are people who already violated the rules, judging by the circumstances.\u201dHer expression, which was always smiling, became a little serious.\u201cSimon Polentia, why don\u2019t you major in Combat Magic?\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened rapidly, and she continued speaking.\u201cI\u2019m willing to accept you as my disciple if you want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dA direct disciple.It referred to students who were directly raised by the professors of Kizen, not anyone else.A professor could have three direct disciples in one student year, and a student could only be directly taught by only one professor.In fact, the benefits that Kizen students received from becoming direct disciples were innumerable. Above all, since the professors themselves had the absolute responsibility and guided the students 1:1, everyone wanted to become a direct disciple.Professors also approached the selection of direct disciples very carefully, as they were directly related to their performance level, and there was a limit on how many disciples they could have.However, Hong Feng said that she would make Simon her direct disciple from the first day of class.\u201cI\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t really get it.\u201dSimon was a bit confused.Of course, he was grateful and appreciative towards Hong Feng\u2019s direct disciple recommendation, but Simon thought that he didn\u2019t show much in this first class.He was merely following the class like other students, and even on the hill-climbing, he lost against Meilyn and Hector.Besides, it was only the second day of school. Hong Feng chose him even though she could meet more students in the future.Regardless of whether he liked it or not, he didn\u2019t quite understand this situation.\u201cYou guys may look at the rankings, but I look at the talent.\u201dHong Feng continued with a sip of tea.\u201cThe operation where you bounced off the jet black when jumping over the valley a while ago. That was your first time, right?\u201d\u201cNevertheless, your jumping power was the best in Class A. This was no longer a matter of talent or coincidence. And you also proved your stamina and patience by climbing the hill this time. Do you need any other compliments?\u201dSimon held his breath and swallowed his saliva.In fact, it was still hard to believe, but it was hard to deny it when a professor from Kizen was putting it like that.\u201cThat stamina, that mentality, and above all, a tremendous talent for jet-black. If you major in Combat Magic, you\u2019ll show and develop your best talent.\u201dHong Feng became terribly serious while locking her fingers. Her pronunciation in the continental language had also become more accurate.\u201cIn a few years, I\u2019ll make you stronger than me. No. Stronger than anyone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon thought about it.He knew that Hong Feng was serious about the direct disciple recommendation, but what about Simon himself?Majoring in Combat Magic.There was no doubt in the fun of Hong Feng\u2019s class.A curriculum which took place outdoors, crises that emerged one after another, and even the outdoor meal and intense competition.There were difficult parts, but if he thought of all of them as part of his training to become stronger, he could endure it.However,\u201cThank you for your proposal. It\u2019s more than I deserve. But\u2026 to be honest, I\u2019d prefer not to.\u201dSimon got up from his seat and bowed his head. She nodded her head with enthusiasm like she wasn\u2019t that surprised.\u201cMay I ask the reason why?\u201d\u201cRight now, there\u2019s another study that I want to deeply indulge in.\u201dHer eyes curved in a half-moon shape.\u201cAlright. Thank you for telling me clearly so that I won\u2019t leave any lingering feelings behind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to give up on you like this, Simon.\u201dHer brown hair fluttered slowly in the wind.\u201cYou still have a year left before you can pick your major, right? I\u2019ll try harder to change your heart, Simon.\u201dSimon was just dumbfounded.\u2018What\u2019s so special to me that you\u2019d go to that extent\u2026\u2026?\u2019\u201cAnd, personally, I became curious to see how far you\u2019ll be able to go.\u201dShe got up from her seat and swung her hand. A jet-black teleport magic circle spread across the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not my disciple. If you need my help, come to me anytime.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you, professor.\u201d\u201cI want you to keep what happened here confidential. You can go now.\u201dSimon bowed his head once again and stepped on the magic circle.Whirr!As Simon disappeared, a wind blew and shook the decorations in the house.She sat on a creaky wooden chair and looked outside the window with a light smile.\u201cProfessor Hong Feng!\u201dThe door burst open and an assistant teacher came in.\u201cHow did it go? Where\u2019s Simon?\u201dShe smiled and shook her head. The assistant bit his lip with a bitter face.\u201cHow dare he decline your proposal\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Brett.\u201dShe tapped the assistant\u2019s shoulder and looked outside the window. Brett fumed, saying,\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you suddenly got your eye on that student! Why don\u2019t you give this proposal to Hector, who\u2019s more gifted with combat magic? Other than him, there are four other aspiring combat magic students with plenty of possibili\u2014!\u201d\u201cA genius.\u201dShe spoke softly.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of geniuses in Kizen, but I\u2019ve never seen \u2018that kind of genius\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dShe smiled without answering.* * *Simon was the last one in Class A to arrive at Kizen.He was exhausted from the arduous class, but fortunately, he still had more than two hours left until the afternoon one.He returned to the dormitory, entrusted his uniform to the minions to do the laundry, and headed to the bathroom to wash off his sweaty body.\u201cSimon!\u201dWhen Simon met Rick, it was in the bathroom. Simon had arrived a little earlier than him, but he had a somewhat excited expression on his face.\u201cHeheheh! You won\u2019t believe it when you hear what happened to me a while ago.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRick took a glance around before whispering in a quiet voice,\u201cI was being teleported after stepping on the magic circle, and it abruptly got almost stuck or something with a\u00a0bam!\u00a0When I woke up, I was in Professor Bahil\u2019s lab all of a sudden!\u201dSimon blinked his eyes.\u201cProfessor Bahil of Curses?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cDid anything happen there?\u201d\u201cHe just got me cleaned up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon made a wry smile.\u201cI heard from the seniors who used to be in Kizen before! Teleport scout! This means Professor Bahil marked me, right? Am I going to be a direct disciple too?\u201dSimon looked away while sweating.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u2026 Maybe, yeah.\u201d\u201cWoah shit, I can\u2019t believe I bridged with a big shot of Kizen like this! You know what direct disciple means, too, right? It basically means your school life will be a piece of cake! Even disciplinary action or expulsion is overlooked most of the time thanks to the professor in charge!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve heard this year.\u201dSimon and Rick turned their heads at the sudden interruption. Hector and two of his faction members stood upright.\u201cA fucking useless commoner as Professor Bahil\u2019s direct disciple? Even a passing dog would laugh.\u201dTheir friends giggled and laughed. Rick stood up slowly, a smile on his lips.\u201cOh my. Was our little master a bit upset because Professor Bahil paid more attention to me than you when you have to be the best at everything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHector took a step closer. Looking at him again, he wasn\u2019t only huge in height or size, but he also had a strong, muscular body.\u201cWatch your mouth, petty merchant.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m a petty merchant, I know guys like you very well.\u201dRick swung his wrist and remarked,\u201cI heard that you also slagged Meilyn off in the Combat Magic class. You fucking think you\u2019re the only one with backstory and hardship? You\u2019re a fucking weakshit too, you bastard. Acting like you\u2019re something special because you went through the education of the Moore family.\u201dIgnited by the insult, Hector stretched out his right arm violently. A jet-black magic circle was drawn on his palm and Rick\u2019s body twisted before roughly slamming against a pillar.\u201cK-Kuhugh!\u201d\u201cThere are things that a lowly being like you can\u2019t say.\u201dHector drew a line with his arm to the side, eyes bloodshot.\u201cJust die here, you bastard.\u201dCreak!It was a curse. As Rick grabbed his neck in pain, the students around him got up and screamed.\u201cKugh! Kuhehe!\u201dDespite his situation, Rick smiled and held out his middle finger. Hector\u2019s expression turned cold, hardening.\u201cC-Calm down, Hector!\u201d\u201cHey! Isn\u2019t this crossing the line? If you use a curse outside of class\u2026!\u201dTwo friends approached to stop him, but they fell on their backs from a single swing of Hector\u2019s annoyed arm.The moment Hector was about to draw a magic circle on the palm of his other hand\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dA foot suddenly appeared in front of him.Slam!Hector narrowly blocked it by crossing his arms. Then, he slipped on the wet bathroom floor and went down to a knee.The curse that was being cast was canceled by the impact, and Rick, freed from the pain, backed off while coughing.Ta-tap.Simon came down to the floor, eyes radiating a brutal glare.\u201cYeah. I was wondering when you\u2019d step in.\u201dHector stood up while grinning. He spewed jet-black from both hands and Simon grabbed the imaginary lever as he flowed the jet-black into the ring on his hand.As the situation was reaching its climax\u2026Bang!A bucket flew under Hector\u2019s feet and shattered, sending the parts all around.Hector and Simon flinched while the other students let out screams of surprise.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s noisy.\u201dSwaaaaaa.The man who was sitting in the bath got up. A stream of water ran down his back, showing countless terrifying scars.\u201cDo you all really want to die?\u201dAnd he was someone that Simon knew. Simon\u2019s eyes widened rapidly.\u2018Kajann!\u2019It was none other than that person who lived in deathly silence in their room.\u201c\u2026\u2026Kajann Edvalt.\u201dHector lowered his arms and looked at him.\u201cI heard the rumors. So you were still in school, huh?\u201dKajann cracked his neck without saying a word. Every time he cracked his neck, you could hear a popping sound so loud that it was hard to believe that it came from a human.\u201cHector!\u201d\u201cB-Be careful. His eyes have gone completely mad!\u201dHis friends ran and stood in front of Hector, as if escorting him.But\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s stop this.\u201dThe words that came out of Hector\u2019s mouth were unexpected. The two friends looked at him in bewilderment.\u201cIt would be better for you to behave well. There\u2019s no second chance.\u201dHector walked out of the bathroom with big strides. His friends, who had been spacing out for a moment, followed Hector like they were running away.\u201cRick!\u201dSimon quickly checked on the condition of Rick, who was lying down on the floor.\u201cYou alright?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dRick chuckled.\u201cThe curse he placed on me was also just to scare me. He doesn\u2019t have the balls.\u201dSwaaaa.Kajann went back into the bath and closed his eyes as the situation wrapped up. You could see the students in the same bath slowly moving away while checking on him.Simon stood up and said,\u201cKajann, thanks for the\u2014\u201d\u201cYou guys are noisy too.\u201dBack turned, he said,\u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon had a faint smile on his lips. He thought that Kajann wasn\u2019t a bad person after all.* * *There were a few events, but they ended without any major problems.Rick revealed that he was actually provoking Hector to get him punished. Of course, since Simon attacked Hector, both of them would be punished as, even if the punishment was issued, Simon had still struck Hector. So, he neatly abandoned the plan.Rick smiled brightly while Simon felt embarrassed and apologized after hearing the story.\u201cIt\u2019s much better that you stepped in! It felt so refreshing when you kicked Hector.\u201dHe\u2019d also done the provocation because he was carried away by the emotion. After all, in the end, they were on student protection period. Even disciplinary action wouldn\u2019t do significant damage. Of course, Hector must\u2019ve known that.When they came out of the shower, the school uniform cleaned by washing magic was delivered in the front of the dorm room.The two quickly changed into school uniforms and safely finished the one remaining class in the afternoon.When they finished all the scheduled classes, it was already dark. Simon and Rick were on their way back to the dormitory after having dinner.\u201cUaaah! It\u2019s finally the weekend!\u201dShouted Rick as he stretched.\u201cSimon, what are your plans for the weekend?\u201d\u201cThe weekend? I don\u2019t really have any plans in particular.\u201d\u201cHey~ you shouldn\u2019t do that! In Kizen, how you spend your weekends is really important.\u201d\u201cSaying it like that\u2026 You must have some plans.\u201dRick nodded.\u201cActually, the weekend schedule is more important to me than the weekday classes. I\u2019m going down to Rochest.\u201dRochest. A city affiliated with Kizen. It was a medium-small-sized city that became active by the visits of employees, students, and minions of Kizen.It was famous as a resting place for Necromancers and a student city. It consisted of countless restaurants, inns, and shops related to necromancers, and you could often see students of Kizen working part-time to earn money for class materials.In particular, on the weekends, students flocked and made for a huge floating population. Usually, what students meant by \u2018let\u2019s hang out on the weekend\u2019 was the same as saying that they should go to Rochest.\u201cBut what are you going to do in Rochest?\u201d\u201cDrawing up a business plan.\u201dRick answered quite seriously.\u201cThe money that Kizen provides for living expenses every month isn\u2019t enough to live on. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m overwhelmingly amazing at my studies, letting me get a scholarship. Gotta make use of my skills.\u201dSimon nodded his head. It was a fast movement by Rick, as expected from him.\u201cSimon, you also better set up some kind of way to make some money too. It\u2019s only during the student protection period that the professors provide materials as they are now. The monthly living expenses can\u2019t cover the enormous cost of materials for Kizen\u2019s classes. The seniors have their own unique income route.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 Really?\u201dHaving to be independent, with even things other than the class, wasn\u2019t an easy life. Plus, Simon was interested in Summoning, which cost a lot of money, so he had to come up with a countermeasure.\u201cHeheh. Or, wait for me till I establish something in Rochest. I might even provide you a job.\u201d\u201cNah. I should earn the money that I need.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, you\u2019re quite aware of what it takes when it comes to money. I see.\u201dBefore returning to the dormitory, Rick secretly sneaked out, heading to Rochest, saying he would prepare for tomorrow\u2019s schedule.Of course, going out of Kizen on weekdays was prohibited, but there weren\u2019t any big problems if you weren\u2019t caught since the school\u2019s tradition was very free.Simon returned to the dormitory alone. He bought some snacks in the cafeteria before returning to treat himself for the weekend.He was going to thank Kajann properly if he was there, but he\u2019d left the room today as well.Left alone, Simon sat on the spacious floor and opened his snack. It was a fluffy mini chiffon cake cut into six slices.Simon put one of the cakes in his mouth.It was delicious. As he was enjoying and munching the rich flavor of butter\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe could feel a gaze.Simon carefully turned his eyes and looked towards the window. He saw a girl hanging from the window, her eyes wide open.\u2018N-Nefthis\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u2019By the way, he was on the 4th floor.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18He didn\u2019t want to keep pretending that he didn\u2019t see her, so Simon turned his head to the window. The girl\u2019s face swung down as well.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDid she not want to get caught?Simon turned his head back and took out a new chiffon cake. Her face then slowly rose to the window.Blink blink.The girl\u2019s blue eyes blinked. Every time the chiffon cake came closer to Simon\u2019s mouth, the speed of her blinking increased.Simon laughed in his sleeve and opened his mouth.\u201cNefthis, please come here and have some too.\u201dWith those words, the girl stuck her face out.\u201cAh. How did you know? Can I?\u201dNefthis jumped over the window expectantly, hurriedly approached, and sat down with her knees together. Then, she opened her eyes and looked up at Simon.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It looked like a puppy waiting, its tail waving.\u201cOf course. Help yourself.\u201d\u201cHehe. Thank you for the food!\u201dShe took the chiffon cake with her cute little hands and began to eat it.Nom nom nom.Seeing her two small fluffy cheeks moving, Simon felt a strong urge to stroke her head, regardless of her being the ruler of Kizen or whatever.\u201cWould you like to eat this too?\u201dSimon took out more snacks he had bought from the cafeteria, and Nefthis\u2019 eyes twinkled each time.\u201cI wub it!\u201dAs she chewed the jam sandwich, she said,\u201cThey always don\u2019t let me eat sweets at home!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ahaha.\u201dSuddenly, Simon happened to have dessert time with the great necromancer who was hard to even see once in your entire life. The two talked while sharing the snacks, starting from the appreciation for buying the subspace and the story of Lorain.And the topic naturally shifted to school life.\u201cYou said this is your first time going to school, right? How was it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun!\u201dSimon answered immediately.\u201cThe professors are cool, friends are kind, the classes are fun\u2026 I think I\u2019m more suited for this than I thought.\u201dShe smiled broadly and nodded her head.\u201cHyaah~ It\u2019s great. Talking with you at Kizen like this reminds me of Richard.\u201d\u201cMy father?\u201d\u201cYeah! Your dad was a Kizen student too. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201dIt was Simon\u2019s first time hearing that story. She giggled and wagged her finger.\u201cRichard was no joke. Unlike you, who\u2019s mature, he was an extraordinarily troublesome child who brought a lot of trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026My father was?\u201dSimon\u2019s jaw dropped.To hear that the gentle and strict Father was a troublemaker when he was in school. The images of Father and a troublemaker did not overlap.\u201cOn that, he was so smart. While causing all the trouble, he got professors wrapped around his finger. It\u2019s not just once or twice that I chased and caught Richard trying to run away and skip the class.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026T-That\u2019s hard to believe. Then did my father safely graduate from Kizen?\u201dShe shook her head.\u201cNope. He dropped out when he was in the 2nd year.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cHe suddenly dropped out of the school, saying it\u2019s too small. There was no such student at Kizen until now. Richard was a special case in many ways.\u201dNefthis leaned back on her arms and looked up at the ceiling.A deep yet faint emotion passed across her face, unlike her youthful appearance.\u201cYeah. I was also young back then.\u201dSimon wanted to point something out, but he didn\u2019t since it felt like he shouldn\u2019t.\u201cAnyway! There\u2019s probably no place on Roke Island that Richard hasn\u2019t been to. You might find traces of your father all over the school if you look closely!\u201d\u201cAh! It will be fun if something like that exists.\u201dShe got up from her seat and dusted off her clothes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going ahead since I have dinner plans! I might get scolded again if I be late. Hehe.\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201dSimon surprised himself, saying words that contained a hint of sadness.The time with her felt so fun and short that he unwittingly confided in her.\u201cWe\u2019ll soon be able to see each other again, Simon.\u201dNefthis smiled.\u201cThank you for the snacks! Bye!\u201dWhen Nefthis was about to jump over the window, something like a small note fell from the clothes she was wearing.Simon picked up the note and hurriedly ran towards the window.\u201cNefthis! You left this\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhiiish.She had already disappeared without a trace.Simon scratched his head and checked the outside of the folded in half note top to bottom.\u201cGiven the circumstances\u2026\u2026 she\u2019s giving it to me, right?\u201dSimon muttered to himself and sat down on the bed. Then, he unfolded the piece of paper.It was a map.The map pointed to a spot outside the Kizen passing through the inside, but the destination was marked with a skull.\u2018A skull, huh? Shouldn\u2019t there usually be some sort of treasure chest mark at the destination?\u2019Simon carefully looked through the map. There was no information other than the destination.\u2018Why did Nefthis give me this location?\u2019\u2013 You might find traces of your father all over the school if you look closely!Simon made up his mind and clenched his fists.He decided to depart the next day.The morning of the first weekend in Kizen came.The place marked on Nefthis\u2019 map was a forest that was forbidden to enter, so he decided to leave when the day was turning dark.Rick and Kajann left the room early and Simon had opened up his Summoning textbook, immersing himself in catching up with the prior learning.He tried to study other subjects besides Summoning, but he couldn\u2019t concentrate well.Since he had to choose one major subject before the upcoming group activity anyway, Simon decided to go all-in on Summoning this weekend.The difference between a skeleton and a zombie. The first is obedience in commands. While skeletons obey the necromancer\u2019s commands well, zombies are hard to control as their instincts and hatred for the living are amplified.\u2019\u2018So the next step after the zombies is ghouls. Although the population is small, they\u2019re strong and incomparable to zombies. Woah! They can move up to 300 meters in a single leap?\u2019\u2018There\u2019s this thing called an Abomination too! When can I make this kind of thing?\u2019He didn\u2019t know studying could be so fun. Time flew rapidly, and Simon had to gulp down the frustration every time he looked at the clock.After spending a full day studying Summoning, Simon finally sprung into action as the sun went down.On the list of exeats, he wrote \u2018Visit to Rochest for 2 days and 1 night.\u2019Rustle.He left the main gate of Kizen and arrived at the Forbidden Forest as it was getting dark. The reason why Kizen banned this forest was simple.\u2018Monsters frequently show up in the area.\u2019Monsters were also present in the mountainside of Les Hill, but it was still unknown what kind of monsters were roaming on Roke Island.Simon moved cautiously.\u2018I can see a creek flowing to the East, and the walls of Kizen can be seen on the West. I\u2019m going in the correct direction.\u2019Traveling was smooth so far as he was checking the map carefully.However, as he went deeper into the forest, the cry of animals were heard more frequently and he also found their excrement. He could find out that it was recently formed as it was wet and sticky when he poked it with a branch.\u2018\u2026\u2026Hup. I just wanna go back.\u2019He\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t scared, but Simon pulled himself together. Although it was a little slow, he walked as quietly as possible.And then,Grrrrrrr.A cry was heard nearby.Simon\u2019s body stiffened. He covered his mouth and lowered his posture.His eyes, used to the darkness, caught the black shadow standing under the shade of the trees. It was sniffling and flaring its nostrils.\u2018It\u2019s a monster.\u2019At that moment, the monster\u2019s head, which had been flaring its nostrils, turned. Eyes glistening in the darkness stared at Simon.Ta ta tap!\u2018It\u2019s fast!\u2019Simon urgently placed his hand on the dagger on his waist. The eyes sparkled in the dark and the silver trail zoomed closer.Simon drew the dagger and swung it towards the trace.Clang!His body flew over with the sound of metal clanging. Its claws swung again, leaving long scars on the tree.\u2018A werewolf!\u2019Most ordinary people would say that meeting it would be a death sentence. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t look like an adult since it was small.\u2018I would\u2019ve run away if it was before I came to Kizen, but\u2026\u2026!\u2019Simon adjusted his grip on the dagger and raised his body. With his left hand, he directed jet-black into the ring and pulled the imaginary lever.Slide.A subspace opened on the ground and bones projected out from it.\u2018Restore!\u2019The bones scattered in the air began to assemble in an orderly manner around the skull. Soon, two skeletons completed in front of Simon and stepped on the ground.\u2018It worked!\u2019Simon clenched his fists.A Necromancer\u2019s skill that he was using in an actual fight for the first time.It was very assuring. Aside from the battle strength, the fact that he wasn\u2019t alone gave him psychological relief.With this, it became a 3:1 in the blink of an eye. The werewolf flinched a bit as it was lacking in numbers, but soon exposed its fangs, showing its will to fight.Pow. Pow.Simon made two old short swords project out from the subspace again. The skeletons caught the swords flying in the air and\u2026Kyaaaaaarrgh!The werewolf jumped in, and the battle began.Slash!The attack from the skeleton\u2019s sword left a long gash on the werewolf\u2019s abdomen. However, it jumped right back in and smashed the skeleton\u2019s upper body with its right arm.Slam!Half of the upper body, made of bones, was blown away in a single blow. Simon, who was connected to the undead, felt a tingling pain in his head.However, taking the chance formed by that moment, the skeleton that encircled it pierced the werewolf\u2019s side with their short sword.Kryaaaaagh!The werewolf let out a scream of pain. Simon stretched his right arm out harshly.\u2018Restore!\u2019The shattered bones wobbled and formed a skeleton again, as if time had reverted. The restored skeleton immediately stabbed the short sword into the werewolf\u2019s chest.\u201cNow\u2019s the time! Charge!\u201dThe two skeletons pushed the werewolf to the tree behind them with the swords embedded in it.With a huge thud, the tree shook loudly and leaves fell.\u2018This is the time!\u2019Simon charged in last with the dagger. The werewolf pinned on the tree swung his arms wildly, smashing the skeletons, but\u2026Stab!Simon\u2019s sword pierced the werewolf\u2019s neck faster than the skeletons lost their strength.A terrible sensation of flesh and muscle splitting ran through his wrist, but it was a life or death moment.Simon tenaciously applied strength to the handleThwump. Ssshhhuk.Finally, the werewolf\u2019s body collapsed, dead. Simon, who was taking a step back and exhaling his rough breath, soon had his legs give in and fell to the side.\u2018\u2026\u2026T-That was close.\u2019His lips trembled from the remaining tension of battle.\u2018I don\u2019t have time to space out. Gotta clean the mess up first.\u2019It would be difficult if other monsters flocked here because of the fuss just now and the smell of blood.Simon barely got up from his seat and cast \u2018restore\u2019. One skeleton failed because the damage level was too high, and the other could barely move.Simon placed the restored skeleton in the subspace and walked again.\u2018Come to think of it, this is my first battle since I\u2019ve entered Kizen.\u2019In just three days, Simon\u2019s power had greatly increased.How much stronger could he get if he managed to survive here for a year? No, three years? He couldn\u2019t help but to imagine it.And after walking another 20 minutes or so,\u2018This is the place.\u2019He arrived at the area marked with the skull mark on the map. Looking around, there was nothing.The only strange thing was that trees and grass weren\u2019t growing there.\u2018I have to dig in the ground after all, right?\u2019Simon opened the subspace and took out a shovel he borrowed from the dormitory gardener.After nicely catching the shovel that arced through the air, he rolled up his sleeves and started digging the ground.Thwack! Thwack!It was such skillful shoveling that anyone watching would be astonished.The work didn\u2019t last long. Something hard hit the tip of the shovel. Simon squatted down and swept the ground.\u2018It\u2019s a paving stone.\u2019It was a stone made of a special rock with black color.Simon, who was clearing out the dirt and going through the floor, soon found a groove in the middle of the floor. On that, the groove had the shape of a human hand.When he placed his right hand on it, the size was about the same. However, it wouldn\u2019t be an artifact that opened just like this.Simon activated his core and spewed jet-black from his palm with his eyes closed.Whirrrrrrr!As Simon\u2019s jet-black flowed into the artifact, it lit up. Then, the floor rattled open.\u2018It\u2019s a staircase!\u2019Simon wore a content smile.I wonder what kind of secret is hidden here? Why did Nefthis bring me to this place?Simon moved forward, his heart beating powerfully.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Simon took out two lanterns from the subspace. He held one and made the skeleton hold the other.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe skeleton took the lead, and Simon followed.When he entered the ruins, there was only darkness. The chill from the stone floor seemed to work its way through the feet into the legs.There was no such thing as railings, so he moved carefully, thinking that it\u2019d be instant death if he fell.\u2018This is\u2026\u2026\u2019As he went down the stairs, he saw indecipherable characters carved on the wall.But somehow, the letters were familiar.\u2018Have I seen it recently?\u2019Simon thoroughly retraced his memory.\u2018Right, the ancient rune!\u2019It was similar to the ancient rune that Eric explained during the Epidemiology of Jet-Black class.\u2018Then is this an ancient ruin? Why is a place like this located near Kizen?\u2019Bringing up the countless unanswered questions, Simon continued to descend.Tap.Finally, he went down all the stairs and hit the floor. He must\u2019ve descended quite deep as he couldn\u2019t see the ceiling, even if he held up the lantern.There was a need to broaden the scope of the search. Simon summoned a second skeleton, gave it a lantern, and ordered it to explore the area.Simon himself also walked with a lantern, illuminating the surroundings. Ancient runes were engraved all over the floor and walls.\u2018If there are this many runes\u2026\u2026\u2019This whole ruin itself was basically a gigantic magical device.Rattle! Rattle!The skeleton signaled that it had found something. Simon quickly ran towards it.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019There was an altar in the middle of the ruins full of runes, and a skull was placed on it.Simon put the lantern down on the altar and carefully brushed off the skull.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019A strange shiver ran up his arm.Simon didn\u2019t know much about the undead, but for this one, he could instinctively understand.This was the remains of an innumerably old and terribly dangerous undead.Simon carefully lifted the skull.Crumble!\u201cWoah!\u201dAs he lifted the skull, bones fell from the ceiling. Simon quickly backed away and dodged.\u201cT-That startled me.\u201dHis skeletons approached and lit the floor with their lanterns. Simon, who was staring at the bottom, picked up a bone that had fallen to the floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026No.2?\u201dMuttered Simon to himself before putting the bone under the skull.They fit perfectly, like pieces of a puzzle.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA strange feeling of excitement began to rise from the depths of his chest.He wanted to assemble that undead. He didn\u2019t know how the undead would act towards him or what harm it\u2019d do when it woke up.Nevertheless, he felt that, if there was a time in life when he had to boldly bet on something, then now was the time.Having made up his mind, Simon put the skull down on the altar and placed his hand on the palm mark underneath it. Then, he channeled the jet-black as he did a while ago.Whirrrrrrrr!\u201cKugh!\u201dHe only used a little bit of jet-black, but he felt like the jet-black inside his body was being sucked into the altar too.The altar emitted a dark blue light, and a blue, thread-like fire appeared in the skull\u2019s eye socket.\u2018Hm. So this isn\u2019t complete yet?\u2019Simon tried putting the No.2 bone close to the skull.With a tap, it stuck like a magnet. The unique \u2018attraction\u2019 of skeleton-type undead was working.\u2018Great.\u2019Simon put down the skull before knuckling down and starting to work.He matched the bones together as if possessed, and it was more fun than ever.Form a spine by connecting the Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar, Sacrum, and Coccyx in sequence. Connect the scapula and clavicle in front of it, and lastly, add ribs to form an upper body.He formed the pelvis on the bottom by picking up gluteal bones and adding them under the caudate vertebrae. The shape of the leg gradually appeared as the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella were connected.\u2018It was worth studying Summoning since morning after all!\u2019He wasn\u2019t 100% sure, but this skeleton had a skeletal structure of a \u2018human\u2019. With Simon\u2019s intuition and knowledge of Summoning, he could assemble the bones smoothly.But this skeleton was too tall.Simon had to assemble it in different positions, like kneeling, squatting, standing upright, tiptoeing, and climbing onto the altar, struggling.It would\u2019ve been nice if the skeleton bent its body, but it didn\u2019t move at Simon\u2019s commands. As soon as the legs were completed, he got up on his own accord.\u2018I should\u2019ve assembled the arms first instead!\u2019Simon finished the rest of the arms while whining. He looked at the skeleton from a distance, feeling overwhelmed.\u201cWoaaah\u2026\u201dA huge skeleton over 2 meters tall was standing in front of him. It was an astonishing sight, but it still didn\u2019t move.\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201dWhaaaeep!A dazzling moonlight fell from the ceiling like a curtain of light.The moment the moonlight shone on the skeleton\u2019s skull, the eye socket started to burn like a torch.[Fwahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!]The ruin\u2019s floor and walls made of sand shook from the massive laughter. Soon, the runes on the wall\u2019s surface came off and formed a stream, covering the skeleton\u2019s body like silk.The runes were being sucked in and were absorbed into the bones of the skeleton.[Finally! Finally I have returned!]Simon covered his ears at the loud shout. The jet-black radiating from the skeleton\u2019s body reminded him of harsh waves.[Who woke me up?!]The skeleton\u2019s head moved while creaking. Then, he saw Simon standing nearby, holding onto the wall.Step. Step.The huge being approached Simon. Then, he stuck his head out right in front of Simon and observed him.Simon had to try his best not to scream.[Name yourself, Human.]\u201cI-It\u2019s Simon Polentia.\u201dThe skeleton\u2019s skull tilted to the side.[You\u2019re Polentia\u2026\u2026?]Kuhahahaahahahahaha!A burst of loud laughter echoed throughout the ruins. Simon broke into a cold sweat.[I see! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re Richard\u2019s grandson?!]\u201cNo.\u201dSimon spoke while calming down his pounding heart.\u201cI\u2019m his son.\u201d[Hahahahaha! I see! I see! So that\u2019s how it is! No wonder why the jet-black seemed familiar! It\u2019d be impossible to wake me up unless it\u2019s Richard!]The skeleton turned his back. You could see the shadowless cloak fluttering around him.\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201dThis time, it was Simon who asked a question. The skeleton stopped walking, turned his head, and smiled.It was strange that a skeleton had a facial expression, but he certainly had one.He could open his mouth, he could flare his nostrils, and his glaring eyes were filled with strong curiosity. He was like a living human being.[I\u2019m Pier. Marshall of the Legion.]Pier spoke.[I once tore up the continent with Richard, your father!]The light in Simon\u2019s eyes changed.\u2018That\u2019s my father\u2019s undead!!\u2019Pier, who was laughing broadly, stuck his head out and continued to speak.[But let me ask you first. Who led you here?]His voice somehow felt sharp.Due to the sensation of being tested, Simon gulped and answered,\u201cNefthis Archbold.\u201d[Ahh.]A smile lifted his mouth.[Uhehe. So that\u2019s how it happened! I guess it\u2019s possible if it was that woman! Good!]Whiiiiiiiiish!A strong wind blew like a storm inside. Light flooded the ruins, and the air screamed.[Make a contract with me, Simon Polentia! And lead the \u2018Legion\u2019!]Shouted his father\u2019s undead with open arms.[The Legion will be your will, trampling down everything that stands in your way! The whole world will kneel at your feet and bow their heads!]A voice filled with excitement echoed throughout the ruins.[But you\u2019ll inevitably walk the road filled with the smell of blood! That\u2019s also fate! Son of Richard, are you ready to lead the Legion?!]Simon bit his lip, concerned. Pier laughed as he walked around Simon.[Are you afraid? Are you frightened? What are you considering in front of strength, Boy?!]It was still an unknown ability, even if it was once said to be his father\u2019s power.Simon didn\u2019t know what the Legion was, what the road filled with blood meant, the terms of the contract, or what kind of handicap he\u2019d carry.However,\u201cI want to ask you something.\u201dA question came back instead of an answer. Pier\u2019s face wrinkled in displeasure.[Speak.]\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of use you\u2019ll be. Is that thing called the Legion strong?Halt.Pier\u2019s steps stopped.[P\u2026 Puhuhuhuhuhu! Puhuh! Buhuhu! Bwahahahahahahaha!]Blare!The air reverberated and dirt was falling from the ceiling.Usefulness! A usefulness!This boy wasn\u2019t lost because of doubts and fears. How dare he \u2018evaluate\u2019 the Legion?![That\u2019s a great question, Human! Strong? Shall I destroy the Kizen if you wish?]Grooooooooow!The mournful cries of the dead resounded everywhere. It was a terrible sight, but Simon\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change an inch.[Alright! I\u2019ll answer your question!]Pier withdrew his strength and said,[Your father has already disbanded the Legion once! And I was sealed here! And by waking me, the keeper, up again, the Legion experienced the \u2018first moment\u2019.\u201cFirst moment?\u201d[That\u2019s right! But if we gather the forces of the scattered Legion and restore the former forces again,]The corner of Pier\u2019s lips rose.[No one on this continent would be able to stop you.]\u201cAlright.\u201dSimon nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019ll make a contract with you.\u201d[Kuhehehehehe!]Pier wrapped his arm around Simon\u2019s waist and jumped up to the top of the altar.[Put your hands on my \u2018core\u2019!]Pier\u2019s ribs opened and a mass of jet-black mana appeared from within, beating like a heart.Simon obediently placed his hands on it.[When this contract is made, your life will completely be changed! Are you not afraid?!]\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201dSimon spoke calmly.\u201cIf you people really are the Legion of my father, then it\u2019s natural for me to retrieve you.\u201d[Kuhahahahahahaha! Great! That\u2019s the spirit!]On the surface, he was an ordinary boy who seemed calm and humble, but the qualities of an overlord were shown at times.\u2018You raised a son well, Richard! This guy is different from you!\u2019His dark magic proficiency at the moment seemed low, but he had tremendous potential. And, unlike Richard, his consciousness and emotion were established well. A completed being in the mental aspect.Pier was quite satisfied with this boy.[I\u2019ll proceed with the contract now! Don\u2019t die, Simon Polentia!]\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re back to your senses!]And what he saw as soon as he opened his eyes was a tall skeleton with burning eyes. Simon sat up quickly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Pier! W-What just happened?\u201d[The contract has been successfully made. Feel the change in your body!]Simon blinked his eyes and placed a hand on his chest.\u2018The core got\u2026\u2026!\u2019The size of the core had increased. Not just that, but the jet-black, which used to burden the body if even a small amount remained, now felt comfortable, like a warm object.It felt like something fundamental had changed in him.[Congratulations on becoming one of the \u2018Commanders\u2019 of the Legion, something of which there are only seven of, Boy!]Pier grinned. Simon, who was about to get up, rested his forehead on his palms out of a rushing dizziness.[Don\u2019t overdo it! Your body went through a huge change.]\u201cAh. Understood.\u201dSimon almost blacked out several times while the contract was being formed.It was a terrible feeling, that of your entire body feeling some unknown sensation. It was such a painful time that he often thought that it\u2019d be better to bite off his tongue and die.\u2018I guess I won\u2019t be able to move for a while. I have no choice but to stay here tonight.\u2019Simon sighed and looked at Pier.\u201cI have a question, Pier.\u201d[Speak it, Boy!]Pier folded his arms and spoke solemnly.\u201cWhat\u2019s a Legion?\u201d[\u2026\u2026\u2026]A thick silence fell in ruins for a moment.[What?! Did you make a contract with me without even knowing that?!]\u201cYes.\u201dHe came here because Nefthis, his father\u2019s comrade, had informed him of the place. Then, he met his father\u2019s undead, Pier, taking him in. That was it.Pier laughed dumbfoundedly.[It may take quite some time for me to fully understand a human being like you! Alright, let me explain!]Pier\u2019s eyes became serious.[Before that, how much do you know about the undead?]\u201cUm\u2026 Just as much as a freshman from Kizen.\u201d[Hah! Coming all the way here by yourself fearlessly as a freshman! As expected from Richard\u2019s son!]Pier began to explain.According to him, there were three types of undead in this world.The first was the Summon-type undead.All undead that necromancers controlled fell here. They were artificially created from a corpse through dark magic and moved according to the orders of the necromancer.They disappeared if the dark-magic-induced effects expired or after a certain period.And the second was the Natural-type undead.They were naturally generated undead, not needing a necromancer or dark magic. These were the ones commonly known to people, and they were feared on the continent because of their blind hatred for the living and extreme aggression. It was in the \u2018Monster\u2019 category, designated by humans.And the third was\u2026[The Legion!]Pier raised his voice.[The Legion is located in the middle of \u2018summon-type undead\u2019 and the \u2018natural-type undead\u2019! It\u2019s a natural undead that\u2019s independent with its own core, but it\u2019s also a summon undead that obeys the orders of necromancers and higher-level entities!]\u201cLegion-type undead\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon chewed over it again by muttering and nodded slowly.[There are only 7 Legions in the world. In other words, there are only 7 necromancers in the world who can control a Legion. This includes you, Boy!]The usual Summoning necromancers were said to lead the undead at the Platoon level.There were necromancers that led a company of undead. And also, high-ranking necromancers that were around the Kizen level could operate in a battalion, although it was somewhat inefficient.There was a limit to the number because the undead led by the necromancers were all \u2018summon-type undead\u2019.Summoning them and controlling them all consumed jet-black and mental strength.However, the Legion, which moved with its own mana, was completely free from these restrictions.[The Legion has no limits! Whether it\u2019s a hundred thousand troops or a million troops, they can be infinitely operated! If you have heard the story of a necromancer who leads a large army of undead, then it must\u2019ve been the story of a Legion Commander!]\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon was happy, but, at the same time, a little confused.\u2018I became one of the seven necromancers in the world with no limit to their number of troops?\u2019It was hard to believe.[Are all your questions answered now?]\u201cYes.\u201d[Good! The contract ended successfully, and whether we like it or not, our eggs are in the same basket. Shall we talk about our plans from now on?]\u201cSure, Pier.\u201dPier, who was sitting with improper posture, fixed it. Simon, who saw this, straightened his back as well and sat down.[You and I belong in a special situation. Is that correct?]\u201cYes. I\u2019m enrolled in Kizen.\u201d[Do you not wish to come out from Kizen?]\u201cNot at the moment. It\u2019s against my father\u2019s will, and above all, I still have a lot to learn at Kizen.\u201d[Mhm. Good! I also agree that Kizen has value in use!]Spoke Pier as he tapped Simon\u2019s forehead with his finger.[Then, let\u2019s talk about the special situation that the Legion is in at this time.]\u201cYou mean how the Legion was once disbanded?\u201d[That\u2019s a given. If the Legion had not been disbanded, there would\u2019ve been no reason to contract with you in the first place.]The blue flames rising from Pier\u2019s eye socket grew stronger.[Currently, we\u2019re the common enemies of the Necromancers. It would be easier to say that we\u2019re wanted.]\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d[Because of the crime that your father, Richard, the ex-Legion Commander, committed.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Upon hearing that, Simon\u2019s body trembled slightly.\u2018My father committed a crime?\u2019[Richard committed an unforgivable crime to the world of dark magic. The Legion also helped commit that crime as an accomplice.]\u201cWhat in the world is that unforgivable crime\u2026?\u201dPier closed his eyes.[An act of treachery. Richard loved a priest.]\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSimon felt like he had been hit in the head hard with a hammer.\u2018I\u2019m hearing this story now?\u2019[At that time, the Hundred Year war was going on between the Necromancers and the Priests. It was a very delicate movement! Nevertheless, Richard ordered the Legion to protect her beloved Priest. He made the Legions attack his fellow Necromancers who came to kill her.]Simon tensed up.[Many casualties occurred. An Annihilation order was issued against Richard and his Legion, which I assume remains in effect, even after Richard disbanded the Legion. This is the reason why the Legion cannot appear in the outside.]\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter hearing Pier\u2019s story, Simon felt a much stronger sense of responsibility towards the Legion.He felt that it was his fate as a son of Richard and Anna to accept Piere and the Legion, bearing their risks together.[Boy, there is no need for you to feel guilty!]Pier laughed with his mouth wide open.[The Legion moves strictly according to the will of the Legion Commander! Richard\u2019s Legion and Simon\u2019s Legion are different. I believe the Necromancers are also aware of that.]\u201cThen\u2014!\u201d[But you\u2019re Richard\u2019s son, not a complete 3rd party. The elders have no choice but to doubt you. And, above all\u2026\u2026\u2026]Pier poked Simon\u2019s forehead with his bony finger.[How do you think the necromancers will act if they hear that a freshman of a Kizen owns a Legion?]Simon\u2019s eyes filled with might.\u2018I can\u2019t let anyone take my father\u2019s power.\u2019\u201cI need to be stronger.\u201d[That\u2019s right.]Pier clenched his fists.[For now, be obedient, obtain the knowledge of Kizen, and become strong! The Legion will gradually recover its former strength. And when the time comes\u2026]\u201cYes.\u201dThere was no need to say more.Simon and Pier nodded simultaneously.[Going back to our main point, we\u2019re in a special situation. That\u2019s why I, the Marshall, propose to you a new way to manage the Legion!]\u201cHow\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dPier raised his arm and signaled.The skeleton that Simon had summoned earlier and was holding the lantern walked near.\u201cHuh. So you can also control my skeletons, Pier?\u201d[Of course! Now we share jet-black. All undead summoned with your jet-black belong to the Legion. You have the highest command authority as the Legion Commander, and I have the 2nd highest. However\u2026\u2026]Pier rubbed his chin.[This undead hasn\u2019t yet gone through \u2018conscription\u2019.]\u201cConscription?\u201dThe skeleton approached Pier. Pier raised his arm and touched the skeleton\u2019s skull.Whaaaaap!Simon\u2019s unique dark blue jet-black soared like a flame, and the skeleton\u2019s body floated into the air.The jet-black that had roamed around the air in a huddle was sucked into the skull at once and formed a sphere resembling a \u2018brain\u2019.After a while, the skeleton fell to the floor.[This is the conscripted undead!]The skeleton slowly began to rise. There was no difference in its appearance, but dark blue flames like Pier\u2019s were surging from its eye sockets.To put it simply, the conscription that Pier was talking about was the process of \u2018summon-type undead\u2019 becoming a \u2018natural-type undead\u2019.Since these undead moved with their own cores, the summoning time limit disappeared, and they could exist forever without Simon having to even lift a finger.\u201cBut it\u2019s kinda obvious.\u201d[That\u2019s right.]Simon put on a worried expression.If he brought these back to Kizen, he\u2019d get caught right away.[So there\u2019s no need to \u2018conscript\u2019 all the undead! Unless it\u2019s an undead that has existed for a long time like me, it\u2019s common knowledge that the summoning type has better combat efficiency. So Boy, just keep utilizing the summon type undead as usual. Then, when the skeleton\u2019s holding time is over or it\u2019s so damaged that you can\u2019t use it, bring it to me. I\u2019ll conscript it and station it here.]\u201cAh. I like that kind of operation method!\u201dCommon undead such as skeletons and zombies were usually single-use, but Simon could now permanently preserve undead like a warehouse.In addition, if it wasn\u2019t seriously damaged, it could self-renew through conscription.[Therefore, get stronger, Boy! If you can summon better undead, the strength of the Legion will also increase!]\u201cYes. Of course.\u201dWhile he was at it, Simon also incorporated to Pier\u2019s side the two skeletons that were damaged from fighting the werewolf.The skeleton, who became a natural undead, also changed its behaviors.Originally, they spaced out like a broken doll without Simon\u2019s command, but now, they showed a bit of animal-like behavior, scratching their heads or running around involuntarily. Then, when Simon called, they came running.It was proof that the power of a Commander was working properly.Even after the serious talk about the Legion\u2019s operation plan was over, the night was far from over. Simon and Pier, who sat next to each other, started chatting.[Boy. How long has it been since you enrolled in Kizen?]\u201cIt\u2019s been three days now.\u201d[I see. Hold it out just a bit more! After a little while, it\u2019ll be possible to receive the \u2018mission\u2019 that comes down from Kizen, even if you\u2019re 1st year. Of course, you can travel all over the continent with the teleport magic circle, not just Roke Island!]The corner of Pier\u2019s lips raised and he continued.[When that time comes, I\u2019ll go with you! You\u2019ll also be able to operate your Legion as much as you want! And, under the pretext of the mission, gather the old forces of the Legion scattered across the continent! Everyone would be happy to join under Richard\u2019s son!]Simon\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cI see you know quite a lot about Kizen, Pier.\u201d[Heheheh! Of course! I\u2019ve been watching your father\u2019s life in Kizen! He was a notorious and problematic kid in Kizen.]This overlapped with what Nefthis said. And on Pier\u2019s face, as he was telling Richard\u2019s story, a deep yet faint emotion flowed.[Yeah. It was fun back then.]This feeling also overlapped with Nefthis\u2019. Simon carefully asked,\u201c\u2026\u2026Pier, don\u2019t you resent my father?\u201d[Resent? Are you talking about resentment? Hahahaha! A weak feeling like resentment doesn\u2019t exist in the Legion! The Legion only moves at the order of the commander, and even if your father chooses the priest and uses us as a sacrificial lamb, we\u2019ll gladly accept that order! That\u2019s the Legion!]After saying that, Pier paused and rubbed his chin.[But if the son of that guy repeats the same bullshit again, it could anger us. Don\u2019t you agree?]\u201c\u2026\u2026ahaha.\u201dSimon talked with Pier until late in the morning. There were many topics, but the story about his father was the most memorable.It was far more candid than what he had heard from Nefthis.[Why would I hide it? Your father was notorious garbage!]Pier chuckled loudly.[In front of a female student who followed him because she liked him, Richard had played with the underwear of a girl he went out with the day before!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cAren\u2019t you exaggerating? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d[\u2026\u2026Exaggerating? Bwahahahahaha! I\u2019m only talking about moderate-level episodes now to save Richard\u2019s face! Do you know how many women he made cry?\u2018No way.\u2019Simon shook his head in denial.[Yeah. Such a damn asshole\u2026\u2026]A strange lingering sound mixed in with Pier\u2019s voice.[The scumbag that even the professors of Kizen gave up on\u2026 Everything changed after meeting a woman. He was like a different person. It wasn\u2019t a change that could be expressed in terms like the \u2018power of love\u2019 that is commonly spoken of in the world. It was like\u2014]At that moment, the Pier\u2019s voice stopped all of a sudden. Then, he turned his head and looked closely at Simon.[Wait, wait, wait! No! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Y-You said you were Richard\u2019s son, right? Then, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026!]Simon smiled with delight.\u201cYeap. My mother is Anna Polentia.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A son born between my friend and an enemy! How in the world\u2026\u2026?!]It was the first time he had seen Pier so bewildered.Simon, who suddenly wanted to play a prank, loosened up his neck and mimicked Anna\u2019s voice.\u201cDarling\u2026 It\u2019s time for you to eat!\u201d[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop! Stop it!! A nightmare! A nightmare is resurfacing! Get out of my head right now!]Seeing Pier in pain, Simon held his side with laughter.With this, he took revenge for hearing the dark history of his father that he didn\u2019t even want to know.\u201cI look forward to working with you, Pier\u201d[Don\u2019t smile like Anna, dammit!]\u201cHahaha!\u201d* * *The next morning had come.Simon had stayed with Pier and learned about the operation of the Legion till the last afternoon of the weekend.[You\u2019re hugely mistaken if you think undead are creatures that follow common sense! The reason why undead under the control of the necromancer often eat people is because the caster didn\u2019t fully understand the undead!]And Pier\u2019s education was conducted from the point of view of an undead. It was a different kind of the point of view to Kizen\u2019s professors, so it was fun for the one learning.[What makes the undead move is a strong will of death! Of all the things that a human can do, the closest thing to it would be \u2018determination\u2019.]Simon tilted his head.\u201cDetermination?\u201d[Yes! Let me give you an example to make it easier to understand. Let\u2019s say you, a Kizen student, met an annoying senior. You think you want to kill him several times a day. Then the undead next to you will remember that determination.]Simon, who was listening while nodding his head, suddenly felt the hairs all over his body stand on end.\u201cWait. Then don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026!\u201d[Yes. That undead will now try to eat up the senior while you\u2019re away!]Flames swirled in Pier\u2019s eyes.[Even if your feelings for him are relieved! Even if time passes and he disappears from your memory! The undead will forever seek his life.]\u201cTh-That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201dPier chuckled.[Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tell you about these kinds of precautions from time to time! Going back to the main topic, the most important thing when controlling the undead is a strong determination! Boy, try ordering that skeleton standing in front of the wall to attack it!]\u201cAh, sure.\u201dSimon stood up from his seat and stretched out his right arm.\u201cAttack that wall.\u201dRattle.The skeleton ran and started scratching the wall with his hands and kicking it.[That won\u2019t cut it.]Pier shook his head side to side.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Then how should I do it?\u201d[Watch closely.]The expression of Pier\u2019s eyes became horrid.[As long as you\u2019re giving an attack order to the undead, place hatred on whatever the target is! Think of it as the enemy of your parents! The devil who killed your lover! Put more hatred on that wall than anything else in the world! Destroy it! Tear it up! Shower yourself with its blood!]The movement of the skeleton that was hitting the wall began to gradually change. He scratched hard enough to leave a mark on the wall and smashed it with his whole body.At the same time, Pier\u2019s voice grew louder and louder too.Bang!Wham!Ba-ba-bang!The attack grew stronger and stronger. In the end, the skeleton started smashing its skull into the wall while letting out a horrifying shout.Seeing that fierce spirit terrified Simon.[Do you now understand, Boy?! The stronger your determination is, the higher you can raise the potential power and initiative of the undead!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026While cursing at your opponent?\u201d[I merely explained it from the perspective of you, humans. Language isn\u2019t important here! A first-class necromancer can express sincere determination even when giving orders to chop some wood! And even with the same determination, negative emotions such as anger, hatred, and killing intent have a greater effect on the undead!]However, Pier\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t be heard well in Simon\u2019s ears.The body of the skeleton attacking the wall was being destroyed and shattered beyond control.\u201cP-Pier! At this rate\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201d[Try making it stop. You have the highest authority in the Legion.]Simon nodded and looked at the skeleton.\u201cStop! Stop it now!\u201dSlam! Slam!But the skeleton didn\u2019t stop. Although its skull was cracked and its hands were trembling, it screamed frantically and pounded the wall.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear what I\u2019m saying? I said stop it!\u201dThe skeleton didn\u2019t even pretend to be listening. It even had seizures and began to become more and more aggressive.Pier watched the whole thing silently. It may\u2019ve been a bit of a traumatizing scene for Simon, who was still young, but he needed to firmly embed and understand it. This could be used as an opportunity.The power of determination, and the weight that a necromancer\u2019s order carries.That skeleton wouldn\u2019t stop until it turned to dust.Even if its body crumbled and only its hands and feet remained, it\u2019d beat the wall until its existence was erased.Because that\u2019s what undead were.\u201cS-T-O-P!!!\u201dAt that moment, Simon shouted out while glaring.The air trembled and the ceiling rumbled. It was a booming shout, one that made even Pier flinch.And then\u2026Step!Finally, the skeleton stopped.Its eyes were glancing at the wall, but he couldn\u2019t dare to refuse Simon\u2019s command.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hey.\u201dSimon breathed heavily and glared at the skeleton.\u201cIf you disobey my order one more time, I\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to see the summon that he had created injure itself any longer.Seeing Simon\u2019s ferocious gaze, the skeleton hurriedly looked away from the wall and stood up straight.Looking at that scene, Pier let out a silent exclamation.\u2018\u2026\u2026That kid is already capable of using an absolute order?\u2019It wasn\u2019t the level that could be accomplished by just telling them to put their determination in. It was really outside of Pier\u2019s expectations.\u2018What kind of monster were you raising in the countryside, Richard?\u2019Simon wiped his lips on his sleeve and straightened his posture. Then, he scratched his head with an embarrassed face, as though nothing had happened.\u201cPathetic, right? I can\u2019t even properly control my own undead.\u201d[No, you did well.]Of course, it was a compliment that came from the heart.[In actual fights, there\u2019s no time to curse or scold them like you just did. Keep training so that you can move the undead by squeezing in your determination with one command!]\u201cUnderstoo\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Simon staggered and placed his hand on his forehead. One side of his head was throbbing and hurting.[It\u2019s because you used up all your mental strength. A necromancer always suffers from mental illness. Get enough rest!]\u201cUgh\u2026 Got it.\u201dRest was also important, but he hadn\u2019t eaten anything since last night yet.Simon said he should return to Kizen soon.[We\u2019ll need a means of communication if you\u2019re going back to Kizen!]Pier threw a small skull out of who knows where.[That\u2019s my clone. If something happens in Kizen, use this and call me.]\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dIt was a skeleton with a squishy texture. Simon took a pin out of his bag and hung it there, like the other students decorating their uniforms. It wasn\u2019t bad, so it could be considered to be fashion.\u201cThen see you again next weekend, Pier.\u201d[Huehe! I\u2019ll look forward to your new achievements in the coming week!]\u201cSure thing!\u201dSimon packed his things and left the ruins.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It was about to get dark when he arrived at Kizen.Simon returned to the dorm after reporting his safe return.[Kuhahah! It\u2019s been so long\u2026 Kizen!]Pier\u2019s clone hanging on Simon\u2019s school uniform spoke while twitching. Of course, that voice could only be heard by Simon.[You mentioned that the student protection period isn\u2019t over yet, right?]\u201cYeah. It\u2019ll finish next week.\u201d[Very well! I\u2019ll be able to see a lot of fun in the future! Kuhehe!]Simon opened the door to room 409 and entered.Rick was lying in bed and Kajann was nowhere to be seen all weekend.\u201cOh, Simon! You\u2019re back!\u201dRick got up from the bed with a glow on his face.\u201cHello Rick. Did you have a good weekend?\u201d\u201cIt was so-so. It\u2019s the first day, so I just got to know the merchants and made some investment promises. How about you?\u201dSimon placed Pier\u2019s clone down on the desk before taking off his uniform jacket and handing it in his closet.\u201cI just met someone I know. I guess I spent it well.\u201dActually, it wasn\u2019t just spent well. Simon became the Commander of the Legion, a title which only seven people held in the world.Pier\u2019s clone, who was placed on the desk, grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you spent it well. Ah! By the way, did you see the updated class schedule for next week?\u201d\u201cNah, not yet.\u201dThe faculty staff in Kizen were necromancers who were in active service. The schedule was always flexible since the student\u2019s schedules fluctuated a lot due to their missions and other matters.All students had to check the changed schedule once a week.\u201cWe have \u2018Beginner Dark Magic\u2019 for both tomorrow\u2019s morning and afternoon.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Beginner Dark Magic\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s that class with the group activity, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dKizen\u2019s freshmen took a total of nine classes.<Curses>, <Mechanics of Jet-Black>, <Summoning>, <Necromancy>, <Hemomancy>, <Poisonous Alchemy>, <Combat Magic>, <Defense Against the Holy Arts>, and <Beginner Dark Magic>.Among them, a class that was slightly unusual compared to the rest was <Beginner Dark Magic>, and the professor of this class became the professor in charge of Class A. Classes were conducted in groups, and all of the other 8 subjects were tested.\u201cI hope Professor Bahil is in charge of Class A.\u201dWith the recent teleportation incident, Rick seemed to be hooked on Bahil.\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not important. Looking at the schedule, I think the group will be made during tomorrow\u2019s \u2018Beginner Dark Magic\u2019 class. And once a group is decided, it stays that way for the whole semester. This is a matter of our life and death in Kizen.\u201d\u201cLooks like it.\u201dA group composition for the whole semester. It was undoubtedly important. Simon also tilted his head with a serious face.\u201cThe composition of the group has to be very well-strategized.\u201dRick\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s advantageous if the four members of the group are good at different subjects, you see? I\u2019m pretty average at everything, but the highest score on my entrance exam was Mechanics of Jet-Black, so I\u2019m gonna go this way.\u201dSimon thought for a moment and said,\u201cI haven\u2019t taken any exam yet\u2026\u2026 but I think Summoning would be the best for me.\u201d\u201cOkay! Then one Summoning, and one Mechanics of Jet-Black, huh? It\u2019s really well balanced!\u201dRick continued to speak as he looked through the pocket notebook with the profiles of the Class A students.\u201cThen our next number one priority recruitment target is unquestionably an aspirant in Curses.\u201d\u201cCurses? How come?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain. Look closely.\u201dRick put the pocket notebook down and took a notebook and quill out of the desk drawer.\u201cThe subjects with the highest credibility points in Kizen, what\u2019s known as the \u2018three studies of a Necromancer\u2019, are Curses, the Mechanics of Jet-Black, and Summoning. The students call it \u2018C.M.S.\u2019 for short.\u201dRick nicely wrote Curses, Mechanics of Jet-Black, and Summoning in the notebook and tied them together with a circle.While looking down at the notebook with careful eyes, Simon said,\u201cWe\u2019ve completed \u2018M.S.\u2019. That\u2019s why we need a curse specialist.\u201d\u201cAs expected from you, Simon! You\u2019re catching on quick! Well, these days, the proportion of Summoning has lowered, so some people call it \u2018C.M.S.N.\u2019 or \u2018C.M.N.\u2019, putting Necromancy instead of Summoning but\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s a fact that these three subjects are the most widely known ones.\u201dSimon nodded his head.\u201cAnd after the C.M.S., there\u2019s a thing known as the \u2018four majors\u2019, <Necromancy>, <Hemomancy>, <Poisons>, and <Combat Magic>. In short, \u2018N.H.P.C.\u2019. These subjects are also important, but there are many cases where people choose it as their major and dig in deep rather than feeling like they need to learn everything to begin with.\u201dRick wrote down all seven subjects in the notebook and wrote the last two subjects below.\u201cAnd the supplementary subject, <Defense Against the Holy Arts>, and the general compulsory subject, <Beginner Dark Magic>. People call it \u2018D.B.\u2019, combining those two. It\u2019s impossible to choose these subjects as your major.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dSimon organized it in his head while counting on his fingers.\u201cC.M.S., N.H.P.C., D.B., for a total of 9 subjects.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cFour people in a group, right? If we bring in an aspirant for Curses and complete the \u2018C.M.S\u2019, who should we recruit for the one remaining member?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to put our heads together for and think about right now!\u201dRick got excited and turned the notebook to the next page.\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s good to skip Combat Magic students among the N.H.P.C, you know? People from combat magic are only good at combat magic. They tend to be bad at the other subjects. I checked everything in Professor Hong Feng\u2019s class last time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So we have to consider those kinds of things too?\u201d\u201cYes. And generally, students who want to major in Curses have high grades in Defense Against the Holy Arts and students who\u2019re into Hemomancy tend to have high grades in Poison as a lot of things are compatible between them. We need to understand all these kinds of things.\u201dSimon and Rick pondered the plan to recruit for the group until late at night.Rick, who had a lot of knowledge, led the plan, and Simon, who was listening quietly, also sharply pointed out some things. Rick immediately agreed and changed direction too.As a result,\u201cPerfect! Then, we\u2019re finalizing this, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe recruitment targets, prioritized from No.1 to No.10, were decided for tomorrow\u2019s group class.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe recruitment targets, prioritized from No.1 to No.10, were decided for tomorrow\u2019s group class.The No.1 target was \u2018Jamie Victoria\u2019.She was a student aspiring for Curses and had excellent grades. Having a cheerful personality and the ability to take the initiative were favorable factors too.No.2 was \u2018Claudia Menzies\u2019.She was the ideal talent who was mainly good at hemomancy and pretty good at poisonous alchemy. If they could recruit her, things would be comfortable throughout the 1st semester.Other than her, they\u2019ve created a list up to 10th place.\u201cEven if we can\u2019t recruit Jamie or Claudia, it\u2019s important to let go of them and move on to the next students quickly. Ah! When recruiting, I\u2019m going to appeal that you, the special admission No.1, is in my group. Would that be okay with you?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s okay.\u201dThe two lay down on the bed after making a lot of plans.Simon was feeling somewhat proud.\u2018Would there be any other group that prepared this strategy like us?\u2019He was inwardly looking forward to their class tomorrow.* * *The next morning,A new week at Kizen had begun.When Simon entered the lecture room for the first period, Beginner Dark magic, it was completely different from last week, where it was deadly silent. Now people were babbling with the ones they knew.When Simon sat quietly and pulled out his textbook, Rick placed his hand on Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cJust came back from talking to Jamie!! I guess I\u2019m done making everyone remember my face.\u201dSimon gave a look of admiration.\u201cYou\u2019re really good at this.\u201d\u201cHehe. Managing personal connections is essential for business. This was originally my job.\u201dJust then, footsteps were heard outside the lecture room. The students ran and sat on their seats.It was finally the moment where they\u2019d find out who the professor in charge of Class A was.\u201cPlease be Bahil!\u201dMuttered Rick. Simon also thought that it would be nice if Aaron of Summoning became the professor in charge of Class A.Other than him, Hong Feng from Combat Magic was fine, and Eric seemed like he could teach dark magic in a kind and caring way.In the moment when the door opened\u2026\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dEveryone\u2019s jaw dropped.\u201cY-You gotta be kidding me, right?\u201dRick\u2019s eyes were shaking too, as if there was an earthquake.The professor broke through the silence and stood in front of the platform.A cold and sharp impression, short hair giving a highly restrained feeling, and charismatic purple eyes.Kizen\u2019s deputy president and a person who held the title of vice-president.\u201cI\u2019m Jane Olivia.\u201dShe was Kizen\u2019s second-in-command.\u201cI have the title of vice-president, but during class, you can freely address me as Professor.\u201dThe closest confidant of Nefthis, and a big shot who wielded the power of Kizen on her behalf.She was close to the pinnacle when compared to the professors that they\u2019d seen.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why is that person in the 1st year\u2019s class?\u201dSilently muttered Rick.As he said, she didn\u2019t usually teach students by herself as she was the deputy president, and even if she did, it was mostly the 3rd year classes.\u201cWell\u2026 as you go through life, you may encounter unexpected situations, Rick Hayward.\u201dRick got startled and stiffened, as if he had seen a frightening image.\u2018H-How does she know my name?\u2019The back of Rick\u2019s head was drenched in a cold sweat. Jane turned her head to look at the students.\u201cI\u2019ll be in charge of Class A\u2019s Beginner Dark Magic class for one semester. As Rick mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve only been in charge of 3rd-year classes, so\u2026\u2026\u201dHer eyes narrowed.\u201cI want you to give enough effort so I won\u2019t feel much difference in level.\u201dThe sound of students gulping was heard all over the place.Actually, it was great luck to attend a class of Kizen\u2019s vice president, but they couldn\u2019t just smile. Not with the rumors about her.Jane was the person most suited to the slang term commonly used among students of \u2018Kizen-ish\u2019.She was famous for daringly expelling students from school if they didn\u2019t show any talent or if she didn\u2019t like their attitude.Even the powerhouse of Kizen, the 3rd years, couldn\u2019t avoid the blade of expulsion, so it was understandable that the Class A students were already in fear.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be beginning the class.\u201dThrough the silence, Jane opened her mouth.\u201cAs everyone probably knows, Beginner Dark Magic is a class that oversees eight subjects and supplements the basics of Necromancers that those subjects cannot teach.\u201dAs she signaled, the assistants took up a thick bundle of papers and handed them out to the students.\u201cBefore that, you must know what your skill levels are in the eight subjects.\u201dSimon and Rick\u2019s shoulders trembled.A test for all subjects from the first class! It was a completely unexpected situation.\u201cThe test duration is 22 minutes per subject. We\u2019ll first take four subjects, then take a 4-minute break to take the remaining four subjects in succession. If I catch someone cheating, I\u2019ll remember the name and expel the student from school when the student protection period ends.\u201dThey didn\u2019t even have time to take a breather.Jane, who had simply put the students under pressure, declared with her arms crossed,\u201cThen, we\u2019ll begin the test.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It was the first-ever school test for Simon.At the same time, it was one of the toughest and most painful three hours in his entire life.Of course, it was more mentally painful than physically exhausting.[7. After the paralysis curse was cast, the target\u2019s body showed symptoms of muscular stiffness and myotonia before becoming petrified 20 minutes later. Assuming that the target\u2019s internal mana loss rate is 0, which of the following is the correct jet-black value to add to the target\u2019s curse resistance and paralysis magic circle?]\u2018\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t solve it at all.\u2019The black parts are letters, and the white ones are paper. It was also clearly written in a continental language. However, Simon couldn\u2019t understand the questions at all.He was frustrated.It must\u2019ve been a solvable problem, but the situation where he had to sit spacing out while other students were moving their quills was frustrating.A feeling of helplessness that he had never felt took over his body.It was arrogant to think that he would adapt to Kizen well just because things had been going well recently or he had acquired his father\u2019s undead Legion.\u2018Yeah, this is the reality.\u2019As he hadn\u2019t done any prior learning, he had to work harder than others.Simon didn\u2019t give up and became more desperate as he faced problems beyond his reach.The three hours passed, feeling like an eternity.\u201cEuuuu.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so hard.\u201dAfter the tests were all over, the expressions of the other students weren\u2019t that good either.Rick turned his head as he passed his test paper to the student behind him.\u201cHow was it, Simon?\u201dSimon put on a bitter smile.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I guess I really have to study hard.\u201d\u201cSame.\u201dAfter retrieving all the papers, Jane spoke, looking at the students.\u201cGood job with the test. Enjoy your lunch, and I\u2019ll see you in two hours.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dNo matter how terrible their moods were, their body standing up when hearing the word \u2018lunch\u2019 was the same.As the Class A students ebbed away from the lecture room\u2026\u201cLet us begin.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJane and her assistants\u2019 work had just begun. They divided and distributed the test papers, scoring in their own seats.Among them, Jane was the absolute fastest.Her hands were moving so fast that it couldn\u2019t be seen with the naked eye. Her quill went all the way down and straight to the next page.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut at some point, a girl\u2019s face appeared next to Jane\u2019s desk.She was placing her cheeks on the edge of the desk and blinking big blue eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026You must be busy, why did you come here, Nefthis?\u201dHearing Jane\u2019s cold question, the girl smiled innocently and said,\u201cTo play!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJane ignored her and went back to scoring the papers.As Nefthis got annoyed, she played pranks, grabbing onto the desk, and waving her legs. Jane struck Nefthis on the top of her head with the edge of her hand, unable to take it anymore.\u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t disturb.\u201d\u201cWaaaaaaah! You always hit me, Janeee!\u201dHolding the crown of her head, she burst into tears, ran, and grabbed the hem of a nearby assistant\u2019s robe.At the sudden appearance of the ruler of Kizen, the color of the assistant\u2019s face also turned white.\u201cPhew.\u2019Jane sighed.\u201cPlease don\u2019t bother my poor subordinates and come this way.\u201d\u201cNo! I don\u2019t wanna! You\u2019re gonna hit me again if I go!\u201d\u201cHurry up.\u201dAs Jane spoke coldly, Nefthis approached, pouting her lips.\u201cEveryone, please go to the empty lecture room next to this and finish scoring.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAs if waiting for it, the assistants took the test papers and evacuated out of the lecture room in a hurry.Nefthis put tension on her eyes and inflated her cheeks.\u201cJane! I think you\u2019re too cold towards me these days!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the same as usual\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph. You really have changed! When I picked you up from the slums, you were an innocent child holding my hand tightly with frightened eyes while trembling!\u201d\u201cThis is what happened to that innocent child suffering from overwork and work-related stress 24/7.\u201dJane told her flat and passed half of the test papers to Nefthis. She blinked her eyes.\u201cHm? What\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by what? While you\u2019re here, help me score these papers rather than disturbing me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter grasping the situation too late, Nefthis stepped back while laughing. She turned her back to try to run, but Jane, who moved faster, grabbed Nefthis and wrapped her arm around Nefthis\u2019 waist.\u201cUwaaah! No! Let me go! I don\u2019t wanna work!\u201dJane calmed down the struggling Nefthis with one more strike to her head, then made her sit properly and handed her the test papers and a quill.\u201cJane, do you know that this is child abuse and violation of the labor law?\u201d\u201cWho the hell is the damn child here? Stop complaining and do it.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dAnd for a while, there was only the sound of the quill moving in silence. Jane, who had finished five test papers at once, glanced at Nefthis.Nefthis, scoring the test paper with her cheeks inflating, wrote \u2018Dumb\u2019 on the wrong question.\u201cWhat are you doing? Please stop fooling around.\u201dOnce again, a merciless attack on the head was made.Nefthis covered where she was hit with both hands and teared up.\u201cBuuuut he\u2019s actually dumb! He got the Question.2 component problem on Poisonous Alchemy correct but made a mistake on the comparison problem right beneath it!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dJane looked at the problem and smiled.\u201cHe solved Question 2 using a formula, and Question 3 was solved with only common sense, without passing it through the brain. It\u2019s a common mistake students make.\u201d\u201cWhat a dumb! What\u2019s his name?\u201dNefthis turned over the paper and looked at the front side.\u201cHm?\u201dThe name was hidden.\u201cIt\u2019s a blind evaluation. If you grade by looking at the name, it might become biased.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You\u2019re going this far for just a test? How thorough.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s just a test, there are a lot of interesting specimens.\u201dJane pulled out a sheet of paper from which she had finished scoring.\u201cAnd this is the opposite of what you graded, Nefthis.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cFrom Question 1 to Question 15, they got all the basic questions wrong, which are basically free points. However.\u201dShe turned over the test paper.\u201cQuestion 20. He challenged the most difficult problem.\u201dQuestion 20 on the last page.The whole test paper was filled with formulas that could make someone dizzy.\u201cWhat are all these?\u201d\u201cAncient runes of the Mechanics of Jet-Black, formulas of an instant skeleton from Summoning, and exhaust calculation method from Curses.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cYes. This student hasn\u2019t prepared any lessons in advance. He deduced the answer by carefully combining only the contents of last week\u2019s class.\u201dNefthis read through the test paper.\u201cWhat? He used a summoning formula when it\u2019s a problem that requires calculating the amount of jet-black? So he solved it by assuming that the resistance is proportional to the jet-black loss rate.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo did he get it right?\u201d\u201cUsing the Theron formula, the answer is 1,200,000.\u201d\u201cThen what answer did this student write?\u201d\u201c1,200,146.\u201dJane\u2019s expression became frighteningly serious.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the answer that was intended by the question, but he gave an answer that was closer to the correct answer.\u201dNefthis glanced at the test paper.She could see that the strict Jane had marked Question 20 correct.\u201cNefthis, there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhy did you assign me to the 1st year\u2019s class? And\u2026\u201dShe tore the white paper covering the student\u2019s name.[Simon Polentia]\u201cIn Class A, where is this boy?\u201dNefthis rested her chin on both hands and smiled softly.\u201cHehe. I don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dJane sighed inwardly.\u2018\u2026\u2026You\u2019re like a 300-year-old fox after all.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are the results already out?\u201dAnd as soon as they entered the lecture room, all hell broke loose. The test results of all the Class A students were posted on a wall.\u201cWoah, that was really fast!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dRumble!As soon as the students entered the lecture room, they threw away their bags and ran.Not only their grades, but also the grades of other students were all publicly shown.\u201cKyaaah! 85 on curses!\u201d\u201cUgh, Hemomancy got all my average chopped away.\u201d\u201cShould I change my major for real?\u201d\u201cSee? Didn\u2019t I tell you to just pick option 5 for Combat Magic!\u201d\u201cYour hypocrisy disgusts me. You cried saying you fucked up in Curses. Why is it 80?\u201dIt was so boisterous that it felt like a public market.Simon didn\u2019t want to check his grades, but he wasn\u2019t so stupid as to run away from reality\u2026He opened his eyes wide and checked his grades.[Simon Polentia]Curses: 40Mechanics of Jet-Black: 33Summoning: 76Necromancy: 35Hemomancy: 20Poisonous Alchemy: 20Combat Magic: 43Defense Against the Holy Arts: 40\u2018\u2026\u2026I guess I\u2019m not too surprised.\u2019He was prepared mentally, but it was a disastrous grade.The only consolation was that his Summoning grade had reached 70 points. Perhaps thanks to studying over the weekend, it seems that the grade came out well.\u201cSimon! Simon! How were your grades for the test?\u201dAsked Rick as he hurriedly ran towards Simon.\u201c76 in Summoning. Everything else is doomed.\u201d\u201cWow! 76?\u201dRick tapped Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cGood job! To be honest, it exceeded my expectations for a person who didn\u2019t have any prior learning! It\u2019s way better to have one subject that you\u2019re good at than to have a decent average grade!\u201d\u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cMy highest grade is 74 in Mechanics of Jet-Black, and the rest are in the 60-70 range. I guess I\u2019ll get around 70 as my average.\u201dSimon blinked his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re also good at studying, huh?\u201d\u201cI just studied to the point where I won\u2019t be expelled.\u201dRick\u2019s face slightly hardened as he said that with a shrug.\u201cBy the way, this is something we didn\u2019t expect. The other students\u2019 grades are all revealed from the first class\u201dRick\u2019s plan was to quickly recruit talented group members in a situation where information about each other was lacking.However, if everyone\u2019s grades were revealed in this way, the students would select their members based on clear and visible criteria.\u201cU-Uhm, everyone!\u201dThe students who went wild with their grades revealed were out of control. The female assistant said while flustered,\u201cPlease return to your seats! Professor will be arriving soon\u2014!\u201d\u201cLeave them be.\u201dSlide.Just then, the lecture room door opened, and Jane entered.At her appearance, the shouts of the students were cut off. Still, their gazes were reluctantly directed towards the grades.\u201cI\u2019ll give you 30 minutes from now.\u201dSaid Jane as she put her bag down on her desk.\u201cAfter checking your grades, make a group of four people. Except under special circumstances, this group will be maintained throughout the semester.\u201dThe expressions of all of Class A hardened.She was starting right away?\u201cHenceforth, Basic Dark Magic will be conducted as a group class, and tasks that can be solved only when each team member works together will be given. Individual and group grades are calculated separately. Of course, even if an individual excels, points will be deducted if teamwork isn\u2019t achieved between the members.\u201dPhew. After letting out a breath, she swung her tie and straightened it before raising the corners of her lips.\u201cSo, you\u2019ll have to choose good members, right?\u201dAt that statement, the emergency switch turned on in the minds of all the students.\u201cIt\u2019s 30 minutes. Students who couldn\u2019t form a group by then will be grouped together to form a separate group. Now, begin.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, the students\u2019 voices poured out.\u201cJasmine! Who\u2019s Jasmine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, why?\u201d\u201cYou had a pretty good grade in Curses! Wanna join us?

Above 60!\u201d\u201cAny group looking for high-ranking Necromancy?\u201dThe race to recruit members has already started fiercely. Simon and Rick also nodded and split apart.\u2018Rick will go directly to Jamie, the highest priority recruit.\u2019Simon moved in search of Claudia, the 2nd priority recruit.But unfortunately, she was already talking to the other two students. Seeing her talking with a flushed expression, it seemed that she had been completely taken in.Rosenthal, a Curses aspirant who was the 3rd priority, acted as the leader herself and looked for members.And the 4th priority, Catherine, a Hemomancy aspirant, was being persuaded by Rosenthal.In the blink of an eye, groups were being formed one by one.\u2018This won\u2019t do.\u2019Rick, who went to Jamie, was also struggling.Students who performed well in this test were given some kind of power. They wanted to form a group around themselves.In particular, as all groups tried to fill the three studies of a Necromancer, \u2018C.M.S.\u2019, as a top priority, Curses aspirants were running out rapidly.This was a crisis. The blank was too big if they couldn\u2019t fill up the Curses spot, which had high credit.\u2018Calm down.\u2019Simon erased the anxiousness that filled his head and calmly analyzed the situation.\u2018It\u2019s still early, and there\u2019s not a single group that has four people.\u2019\u2018They aren\u2019t really searching. Everyone\u2019s in a hurry because there\u2019s a time limit. They tend to combine as long as they have similar grades or different majors.\u2019\u2018The students with average grades are forming groups quickly, and those with the highest grades are observing the situation for now.\u2019\u2018In that case, what I can do here is\u2026\u2019Finally, Simon set a goal and started moving.While numerous students were talking and exchanging stories, Simon steadily walked between them.Occasionally, some students tried to talk to Simon, but Simon refused them euphemistically, saying that they could talk later.He only had one target.\u2018I found you.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Finally, the target came into Simon\u2019s eyes.Unlike the other students who were rushing about, she was like a person from another world.She sat with her arms and legs crossed and sat quietly while observing the situation.Other students around her glanced at her while trying to read her countenance, but they couldn\u2019t take the initiative to talk to her.It was probably because it was nearly impossible to convince her to bring you in with a mid-range grade in the 60-70 region.Simon daringly dug through such a gap of hesitation and finally came to her.\u201cMeilyn Villenne\u201dThe top of Class A.Ranked 1st in the entrance exam grade.And the only one with an average grade of 90 in all subjects on this test.\u201cI want you to join our group.\u201dSimon was aiming to recruit the top from the beginning.The students, reading the situation around them, began to whisper after seeing Simon.\u201cHey! Hey Simon!\u201dRick, who broke through the students before Simon knew, mouthed, \u2018That\u2019s reckless.\u2019In fact, Meilyn wasn\u2019t the No.1 priority recruit because Rick concluded that it was impossible to bring her in.Simon raised his hand a bit to signal Rick to count on him.\u201c\u2026\u2026How funny.\u201dHer eyes, reminiscent of a cold glacier, scanned Simon\u2019s face.\u201cDo you think being a special admission means something?\u201dA voice like a cold blizzard blew.\u201cEven if you\u2019re a special admission, it\u2019s just that you had some sort of personal connection, isn\u2019t it? I only believe in what I see, clear numerical values.\u201dA firm and defensive attitude.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, but an average grade of 30 like yours is a little bit off.\u201dLastly, reality coldly digging into the heart.But Simon endured it. Negotiations to recruit the top started now.First of all, throw in the bait.\u201cYou had a pretty low grade on summoning. 85.\u201dHer eyebrows twitched.Summoning was Meilyn\u2019s only subject in the 80s, and it was her provoking point.But she didn\u2019t budge and fought back.\u201cAre you in a position to say such a thing? Still, my Summoning grade is higher than yours, you know?\u201dOf course he knew. Simon took a deep breath.\u201cI promise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cOne month. In just one month, I\u2019ll surpass you in Summoning.\u201dHer eyes widened sharply with the whispers around her.\u201cAre you crazy? Such bluff, anyone can\u2014!\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t,\u201dSimon interrupted her and said,\u201cI\u2019ll drop out of Kizen.\u201dA shocking declaration from the Special Admission No.1. You could hear bated breaths from everywhere.So far, there had never been a single case in the history of Kizen that a Special Admission No. 1 left the school on their own accord.Meilyn let out a laugh, but the corners of her lips were trembling slightly.\u201cYou must be really crazy, huh? If you don\u2019t want to be humiliated, quickly take back what you said!\u201d\u201cI just said what I can do.\u201dSimon was speaking very calmly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn slightly bit her lips.Simon seized the initiative in an instant, and a strange mood was flowing.\u2018He\u2019ll surpass me? How arrogant. Know your place.\u2019Her eyes turned to Hector, who was mixed among the onlookers.\u2018But\u2026\u2026\u2019Apart from the war of nerves with Simon, she also had her own calculations.Meilyn had to maintain her position as the top of Class A through the whole first semester, no matter what.And the biggest hindrance to this was Hector. His test results were good, and above anything else, he was a person who was better at practicals than written exams. If the duel assessment and performance assessment, which\u2019d be happening soon, were reflected in the grades, she may lose her place at the top of Class A.\u2018Therefore, I need to crush him in the group class.\u2019One problem was that Hector was strong in Summoning, getting a grade of 88 on this test.From the eight subjects, it was the only subject that Meilyn was falling behind in, even in the performance assessment.That was why Meilyn thought of reinforcing an ace of Summoning to help her in this group class.However, Hector moved faster than anyone else and succeeded in recruiting the only person in Class A who scored a 90 in Summoning, Pierre Berkeley.Except for Pierre, the rest of the summoning aspirants were just average.Their Summoning grades weren\u2019t that different from hers.\u2018\u2026\u2026Simon Polentia.\u2019Although he didn\u2019t have any prior learnings, he proudly defeated Hector in the first Summoning class. Like many Class A students, Simon left a strong impression on Meilyn.Meilyn was placed in a situation to make a choice between the two.Recruit other Summoning aspirants with scores in the 80s.Or, carry a wild card named Simon, who has defeated Hector head-on.In that sense, Simon\u2019s statement that he would surpass Meilyn wasn\u2019t provocative or bluffing.It was an appeal of the latter option, which she was concerned about.He talked as if he could read her mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sigh.\u201dFinally, after a long time,Meilyn organized her thoughts, uncrossed her legs, and stood up from her seat.\u201cThat promise. You can really keep it, right?\u201dSimon smiled and held out his hand.\u201cDefinitely.\u201dMeilyn grabbed Simon\u2019s hand reluctantly.It was the moment when Meilyn, the top of Class A and the only student with average grades of 90, joined Simon\u2019s group.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rumors spread quickly, and the students around them began to whisper.\u201cWoah, the two of them are in the same group?\u201d\u201cThe Special Admission No.1 and top of Class A in the same group? That\u2019s too OP.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that. From what I saw earlier, Simon didn\u2019t even have high grades.\u201dWhile the students who observed Simon recruit Meilyn went back into their own competition, some furtively approached Simon and Meilyn.\u201cDo you still have space in your group? I\u2019m an aspirant for the Mechanics of Jet-Black. Can you let me in?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you need a Combat Magic aspirant?\u201d\u201cSimon! Simon! You remember me, right? I\u2019m the one who talked to you in class last time\u2026!\u201dSimon tilted his head back in surprise as the students suddenly rushed in.\u201cWait now! Let me pass through! Thanks!\u201dAt that moment, Rick, who skillfully penetrated through the students, smiled nicely and waved his hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t have any vacancies right now! We\u2019re negotiating for one remaining member, so to be honest, it\u2019ll be quicker for you guys to just find another group!\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dAsked Meilyn, narrowing her eyes.Rick smiled confidently and placed a hand on his chest.\u201cI\u2019m Simon\u2019s groupmate too! Rick Hayward.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMeilyn turned her head.\u201cHey Simon, I never heard that a clumsy one like him was part of us.\u201dSimon scratched the side of his head and smiled.\u201cI told you. That I want you to join \u2018our group\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo there was a burden.Meilyn sighed silently and opened her eyes.\u201cWhat aspirant are you then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an aspirant of the mechanics of jet black with a grade of 74 and a general average of 70.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Pretty average.\u201dActually, from Meilyn\u2019s point of view, as long as she was able to reinforce her weakness, Summoning, the rest of the subjects didn\u2019t matter.A minimum of 90 in all subjects except for Summoning. No one could surpass her.And an average score of 70 and 74 on his major subject meant he was relatively good in all subjects. It didn\u2019t completely satisfy her, but an all-round player who could support her was an acceptable selection.\u201cOkay, got it.\u201dAs Meilyn moved on without saying much, Rick clenched his fists. Then, he turned his head and looked at Simon.\u201cKyahah. For real? You?!\u201dHe was looking at Simon like looking at a hero who returned. The two lightly bumped fists.\u201cYou\u2019re an excellent problem solver! How did you just bring Meilyn in?!\u201d\u201cThe timing was just good, I suppose.\u201d\u201cBut are you really okay with the deal you made earlier?\u201dSimon nodded. He thought that, if he only studied Summoning from now on till he almost died, it would somehow be fine during the midterm tests.\u201cPlease save the tearful friendship between boys for later.\u201dMeilyn spoke sullenly as she rested her chin on her hands.\u201cWho\u2019ll be our last member then?\u201d\u201cWe can bring in anyone you want! Just say the word!\u201dRick was really confident that he could bring in anyone.Who would decline the group with the best ace card, Meilyn?He could also probably pull out even the students who had already decided on a group if he spoke well. But of course, if he did that, they\u2019d be making enemies for the rest of their school life.\u201cHmm.\u201dMeilyn closed her eyes and pondered.\u201cFirst, we need to prioritize putting C.M.S. together. I\u2019ll take Curses.\u201d\u201cThat would be great! Then do you have any subjects that you\u2019re weak at among the four subjects of N.H.P.C.?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing. I\u2019m good at everything.\u201dShe answered as she flicked her light blue hair behind her ear. She was a little bit full of herself, but Rick laughed it off because of the halo effect from being top of Class A.\u201cBut if you had to pick one?\u201d\u201cIf I had to pick one, I think it would be better to find a specialist for Hemomancy, which has a lot of calculations and takes a long time to solve.\u201d\u201cHemomancy? Okay, I\u2019ll bring one! You guys just relax and rest here!\u201dRick left for the battlefield, where countless students were entangled.The ones left, Simon and Meilyn, sat quietly and passed the time.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAbout 10 minutes passed without a word. Meilyn, who pretended to be trimming her nails out of awkwardness, glanced at Simon and said,\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWas it Simon Polentia? I\u2019ve never heard of it. From what family are you?\u201d\u201cA Baron of Baldwin Kingdom. We manage Les Hill.\u201dShe nodded her head.\u2018So he\u2019s from Baldwin.\u2019She had never heard of a territory named Les Hill.\u201cHow about you?\u201dHer eyes widened at Simon\u2019s question.\u201cHuh? Don\u2019t you know me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dKugh. It hurt her pride a little, but she couldn\u2019t get mad when she also couldn\u2019t recognize Simon\u2019s family.She spoke while forcing her smile.\u201cI\u2019m from the family of the Ivory Tower\u2019s side.\u201dSimon recalled his knowledge of the Ivory Tower in his head.He knew one thing. The ash-blonde-haired girl who took the oath with him at the entrance ceremony was the successor of the Ivory Tower.\u201cAh, Ivory tower, you mean where that Special Admission No.2, Serne, is fr\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but,\u201dMeilyn\u2019s smile thickened frighteningly.\u201cCan you not say anything more? Thanks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026A-Alright.\u201dShe coldly looked away.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019Simon was confused. Meilyn didn\u2019t get angrier because she knew Simon didn\u2019t deliberately bring up the topic, but she had a very uncomfortable expression on her face.Looks like he said something that he wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u2018Noble families are complicated after all.\u2019Still, he just had to learn slowly, one by one, and be careful.Simon filed away the topic that the new member was sensitive to, and in the distance, Rick was returning with an imposing gait.\u201cDid you wait long?\u201dA female student was standing next to him.\u2018\u2026\u2026Huh?\u2019Her face was familiar to Simon.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A small height and an innocent, puppy-like face. She stared directly at the floor like she was shy.He wondered where he saw her. She was the same girl that Simon helped because she couldn\u2019t get on the hippo on her own during the Combat Magic class.\u201cI was wrong.\u201dRick waved her notebook and looked at Simon. Then, he introduced the female student to the two of them.\u201cThis is Camibarez Ursula, a Hemomancy aspirant with a grade of 87.\u201d87!Meilyn whistled, and Simon smiled too.Camibarez bowed her head.\u201cI-I\u2019m Camibarez Ursula! If my name is too long, just call me Cami. I still have a lot to learn, but I\u2019ll do my best, so I won\u2019t drag you guys down!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in the same grade. You can talk more comfortably, can\u2019t you?\u201dSimon\u2019s question turned her face red.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah. I\u2019m still 16, yet I enrolled in Kizen\u2026\u2026 and uhm\u2026\u2026\u201dRick also chipped in.\u201cAge doesn\u2019t matter. I heard that there\u2019s 20-year-olds in the 1st year too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Ah, yes. If you guys wish, I\u2019ll talk more in a comfortable way\u2026\u201dIt seemed that she was more comfortable talking politely. Simon and his group members decided not to force it.Having successfully formed the group, the four of them sat around a desk.15 minutes had passed from the 30 minutes Jane mentioned. It was just halfway through.\u201cUghh, I can finally put my mind at ease now! I thought I was gonna get a stress-related disease.\u201dMuttered Rick as he stretched. Simon\u2019s head was aching from the short period of concern.Camibarez was also chatting with Meilyn like she was relieved from the stress of group selection.\u201cWoah, I knew it! You\u2019re from the Ursula I know, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really amazing!\u201dExclaimed Meilyn.\u201cIf it\u2019s Ursula, then it\u2019s that famous vampire family!\u201dSimon looked at Camibarez in surprise.This girl was a vampire?Looking at her again, Simon could see the unique protruding fangs on her innocent face.\u201cI also have wings. It just can\u2019t be seen because it\u2019s covered with the uniform.\u201dHer back wiggled and moved.\u201cIsn\u2019t it uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cIt was, a little, so I asked the administrative office to mend the uniform! By next week, I\u2019ll be able to get the wings out of the clothes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a relief that they\u2019ll fix it.\u201dRick, who was quietly listening to their conversation, folded his arms.\u201cBut it\u2019s a little odd. The daughter of the Ursula family has come to Kizen, but why aren\u2019t there many rumors about her?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dHer face turned red, and she hunched her shoulders. Meilyn glared at Rick and scolded him.\u201cHey, how could you just ask something like that?\u201d\u201cHm? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cUgh. For real\u2026 You\u2019re not a noble, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a commoner.\u201d\u201cThis is why we aren\u2019t on the same wavelength.\u201dShe folded her arms and shook her head. This time, Rick\u2019s expression turned cold.\u201cOnce again, the pride of the nobles starts. Thanks for helping a commoner like me understand.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re annoying. Don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d\u201cP-Please don\u2019t fight!\u201dShouted Camibarez. As everyone suddenly looked at her, she covered her mouth, thinking her voice was too loud, and lowered her head.\u201cI-I\u2019ll tell you. Actually\u2026\u2026 My mother is an ordinary human, so\u2026\u2026\u201dWith that one statement, Simon immediately finished grasping the situation.A daughter born of a concubine in a vampire family.Her father may\u2019ve been the Great Vampire of the Ursula family, but her mother would be a human concubine.Simon, born to a Necromancer and a Priest, also had the same family problems as her, so he could fully understand her feelings.\u201c\u2026\u2026I-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRick scratched the back of his head with an awkward expression.\u201cI didn\u2019t intend that when I asked.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine, really! Hehe.\u201d\u201cNot trying to make up for it, but since you told us your family background, I\u2019ll share mine too. I\u2019m the son of the owner of the White Cow Merchant Association.\u201dRick said that and observed the others with secretly expecting eyes.Camibarez covered her mouth in amazement, but the other two didn\u2019t react much.In fact, Simon just really didn\u2019t know as he lacked background knowledge, and Meilyn was a little surprised on the inside, but she turned her head because she didn\u2019t want to show it.\u201cTo be exact though, I\u2019m the third of the eight sons of the owner.\u201dThere was a trace of bitterness at the end of Rick\u2019s statement as he said that.\u201cMy father is trying to pass the business to my eldest brother. All the educational capabilities of the family are being concentrated on him. Me and the rest of the sons\u2026 are nothing but a Plan B, so we\u2019re just being used as they like.\u201d\u201cAs they like?\u201d\u201cYeah. In my case, I was sent to Kizen because I had a talent for dark magic. I was told to find out the needs of dark magicians and conduct market research.\u201dThat was why Rick said going to Rochester on weekends was more important than having classes on weekdays.\u201cOf course, I haven\u2019t given up yet! I\u2019ll properly graduate Kizen too. And I\u2019m thinking of making a huge merchant association with my name on it in Rochester instead of \u2018The White Cow Merchant Association\u2019. Then maybe my father will look at me again.\u201dSimon chuckled.\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201dCamibarez also clapped her hands.\u201cI\u2019ll cheer you, Rick!\u201dMeilyn mumbled with a sullen attitude,\u201cDo your best or whatever.\u201dSimon and Camibarez laughed audibly.\u201cOh my, the vibe in this group already feels good~\u201dThe assistant teacher approached with a smile. When the four of them were about to stand up, the assistant told them that it was fine and put a piece of paper down on the table.\u201cYou guys are Group 7. Please write the members\u2019 names here and the majoring subjects next to them.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cAnd you have to decide the group name and the group leader too.\u201dSimon blinked.\u201cGroup name?\u201d\u201cYeah. Actually, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Professor Jane will just call you Group 7. There\u2019s still some time left, so think about it carefully.\u201dThe assistant teacher left, and the four of them looked at each other. Meilyn said,\u201cI\u2019ll be the leader. Any objections?\u201dThere were no objections. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that half of Group 7\u2019s power came from Meilyn.As the three nodded, Meilyn wrote her name in the Group Leader column in stylish handwriting.\u201cThen what should we name our group as?\u201d\u201cShe said it isn\u2019t anything important, so let\u2019s just put anything.\u201dRick giggled as he placed his arm behind his head.\u201cHow about something like this? \u2018Hard Carried by Meilyn\u2019.\u201dWhen Meilyn was about to really write it with a delightful expression, Rick stopped her, shouting that it was a joke.\u201cS-Simon! Do you have any ideas?\u201dAsked Rick urgently. Simon uttered without thinking,\u201cTeam Seven.\u201d\u201cThat lacks sincerity!\u201d\u201cHow about this? \u2018Pink Rabbit Girls\u2019\u2014\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re a mixed group! Please consider our place too!\u201dAgain, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to Meilyn.As she blushed slightly, she cleared her throat and said while pretending to give in,\u201cW-Wasn\u2019t the name that Rick mentioned good? Hard carried by Mei\u2014\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just go with Team Seven.\u201d\u201cHey!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The competition among the remaining students was fierce and bloody.Now, there were only a few students who were moving individually. The students mostly gathered the rest of the group members after forming 2-3 people.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we just merged?

What the hell is that combination of two Jet-Blacks?\u201dIf you made a group with your friends or close people, this was a problem.They got to know each other quickly because they had the same field of interest or major they wanted to pursue, but it was bad to stick together with the same major aspirants in a group class.The Beginner Dark Magic class evaluated a whopping eight subjects.When having different majors for all four members of the group wouldn\u2019t be enough, it was a huge loss if they had overlapping majors. Those who still couldn\u2019t make a group usually had that problem.\u201cI\u2019ll save only one person from your group.\u201dA blonde female student walked up with an arrogant expression on her face and raised her finger. She had already found two members.\u201cGet lost!\u201d\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t taken Lucy, we\u2019d already be a four!\u201dA female student stepped forward as the other group members growled displeased faces.\u201cL-Leader?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone.\u201dShe said it even without looking back.\u201cI\u2019m an aspirant of Hemomancy. It\u2019s fine, right, since it doesn\u2019t overlap?\u201d\u201cWelcome! You\u2019re quick-witted after all. Assistant teacher! We\u2019ll submit!\u201dThe leader, who made the group herself, left and became the fourth person in the other group.The remaining students trembled with anger, feeling the sense of betrayal.\u2018\u2026\u2026That\u2019s cruel.\u2019This was what happened during the student protection period.Simon seemed to vaguely understand why only three hundred could survive out of a thousand.\u201cThere\u2019s no time to worry about others, Simon.\u201dSaid Rick.\u201cIf we don\u2019t move forward relentlessly, we too will be eliminated. And elimination in Kizen means farewell.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even find them that pitiful.\u201dMeilyn put her fingers together and blew on them.\u201cLack of effort, lack of preparation, and lack of skills. It\u2019s been four days since they came to Kizen, and what have they been doing? If their grades were lacking, they could\u2019ve tried looking for other ways to find groups.\u201dRick and Meilyn seemed used to this kind of atmosphere.Finally, the 30 minutes that Jane said had passed.A total of eight people remained. They feuded in groups of 2, 3, and 3, and in the end, no one was able to complete the group.\u201cFor those students who haven\u2019t decided on a group, please come forward.\u201dJane randomly created two groups.Group 15: Jet-Black, Jet-Black, Poison, Combat MagicGroup 16: Jet-Black, Jet-Black, Jet-Black, Combat Magic.There were relatively many Mechanics of Jet-Black aspirants because, as it was a compulsory subject, other aspirants also had relatively high grades in Jet-Black.Because of this, the demand for Mechanics of Jet-Black students in the market plummeted, and they ended up remaining till the end.The students who had been called to the platform sank their heads with hardened expressions, and some students who had formed a group already sneered at them.\u201cWoah, three Jet-Blacks on Group 16? Is that for real?\u201d\u201cPfft, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see them next week.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll be doomed if there\u2019s even one problem about Curses.\u201dAt the sounds of other students sneering, the 15th and 16th groups became even more depressed and hunched their shoulders.After choosing the leaders, Jane looked at them and said in a quiet voice,\u201cAre you frustrated?\u201dThe students nodded slightly. Some even shed small tears.\u201cThere\u2019s no rule that your end will still be off because your start was slightly off. Remember this frustration now and try harder. Even if you\u2019re Jet-Black aspirants, divide yourselves up and study other subjects to raise your average grade. Then you\u2019ll see the light.\u201dThe students nodded their heads with a desperate faces.\u201cThen I\u2019ll make a major announcement first. Next week, after the student protection period ends, we plan to conduct a \u2018group performance assessment\u2019 in the first class of Beginner Dark Magic next week.\u201dHushed exclamations could be heard from around the room.The performance assessment was a test that was directly reflected in grades. This was the real deal.\u201cThen I\u2019ll explain the contents of the performance assessment.\u201dWhen she gave the signal, her assistant triggered the mana projector. A picture of a certain large monster appeared in front of the students, projected with light.\u201cThis is\u2026!\u201dIt was a monster that even Simon knew.A Cyclops.A medium-sized one-eyed monster with monstrous power. It was a monster that lived mainly in the mountains of the western part of the continent and reigned as king there.\u201cYes, your next opponent will be the Cyclops.\u201dThe students\u2019 mouths opened wide.Aren\u2019t we skipping too much?\u201cI\u2019ll explain the rules. You and your groupmates must enter the underground dungeon in Kizen and work together to defeat the Cyclops.\u201dSounds of relief could be heard at the fact that at least they\u2019re going in with the group members.\u201cBut only one student will directly encounter Cyclops. The other three can stand in a set position to support your groupmate or weaken the monster. You aren\u2019t allowed to attack directly with dark magic.\u201dClamor.The three in the set position couldn\u2019t use offensive dark magic. Then it couldn\u2019t be said that it was completely a 4:1.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Jane continued her explanation.\u201cYou\u2019re obviously allowed to use disruptive skills such as Exhaust, Bind, and Blind. Therefore, we\u2019ll allow the injuries of monsters out of that kind of judgment. Bleeding of Hemomancy and Poisoning of Poisonous Alchemy are also allowed. Of course, attacks by summons are allowed too.\u201d\u201cHowever, you aren\u2019t allowed to use \u2018direct offensive magic\u2019 such as Smite of Combat magic or Blood Arrow of Hemomancy. You\u2019ll know the exact standard when you receive the handouts distributed by the assistant teachers after class.\u201dThe students nodded with serious faces.\u201cThe one student will wear powerful defensive magic under the participation of Kizen\u2019s safety guard. The grading criteria are the success or failure of the Cyclops hunting, hunting speed, stability, teamwork, creativity, and the perfection of dark magic used.\u201dShe continued after looking around the students, who went silent.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to push your skills to the limit this week to face the Cyclops. Instead of taking class carelessly, make it your own and use it for the performance assessment. That\u2019s all. Any questions?\u201dCountless hands rose from all over the place. Jane pointed at the student in front of her first.\u201cI\u2019m Jamie Victoria! W-We aren\u2019t dealing with a real Cyclops, right? I heard that Kizen also has a virtual battle simulation system, so with that\u2014!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fresh, living Cyclops just caught from the western part of the continent.\u201dColdly asserted Jane.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sign a life waiver before you take the performance assessment.\u201dWith that statement, Jamie\u2019s face darkened rapidly.\u201cStill, it\u2019s probably weaker than a Cyclops you\u2019d meet in the wild because of the curse and potion treatment for capturing. Next question.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Scott Snyder! You mentioned that the hunting of the Cyclops is also a criteria for grading, but what happens if we can\u2019t hunt them?\u201d\u201cFailure to Hunt is the lowest score independent of the other criteria. If there are other failed groups, you\u2019ll compete with them based on criteria to determine the ranking.\u201dA deep silence dropped in the classroom.\u201cThere are three cases in which the \u2018Failure to Hunt\u2019 judgment is made. First, when an entering member becomes incapable of combat. Second, a professor or safety guard judges that combat is no longer possible. Third, if at least one of the group members raises their hand and declares that you\u2019re giving up the test. Next question.\u201dThe students raised their hands in succession and asked questions. Jane answered all of them smoothly.In fact, the parts that the students were curious about were mostly similar, so after five more questions, all of the other students\u2019 raised hands were down.\u201cI believe that Class A has two more Beginner Dark Magic classes left this week. Each group will have time to present their Cyclops hunting strategy in the first class. As Jamie said earlier, in the second class, we\u2019ll have time to adjust and tune our sense of action through a virtual battle with a Cyclops. And the third class will be the real fight.\u201dThe words \u2018real fight\u2019 created a tense atmosphere in the classroom. Jane looked at her wristwatch.\u201cFor the rest of the time, you\u2019ll be able to discuss the Cyclops hunting strategy with your members. First of all, decide the group member to battle the Cyclops and prepare a way that draws 100% of the strength of the other three support members. I\u2019ll be here if you have any questions.\u201dJane sat down on the chair as she had finished speaking. The assistants clapped their hands.\u201cNow, students, please begin!\u201dAs if waiting for it, clamors broke loose from everywhere. Rick and Meilyn also leaned towards the table with their eyes shining.\u201c\u2026\u2026As expected from Professor Jane, A real fight with a monster as soon as the protection period is over? So intense.\u201dSaid Rick. Meilyn had a twinkle in her eyes too.\u201cI like it though. My heart is just racing! Now I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m in Kizen.\u201dSimon looked around once and said,\u201cLet\u2019s also make a plan already. Is there anyone who wants to be the participant?\u201dMeilyn raised her hand. Rick, who was sitting next to her, cried out as he got hit, but her eyes were shining like she didn\u2019t notice.\u201cMe! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cAre you confident?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the strongest one here. Of course I should be the one to do it.\u201dRick stroked his cheek and glanced at Meilyn,\u201cHey, hey! This isn\u2019t something that you can decide that simply. You have to approach it strategically! In my opinion, this performance assessment is so advantageous to the team with Combat Magic aspirants. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re trying to support Combat Magic.\u201d\u201cI agree too.\u201dCamibarez quietly agreed with Rick\u2019s statement.\u201cThe attacks of Cyclopes are heavy, making it difficult to block it with defensive dark magic, and it also consumes a lot of jet-black. Dodging would be best.\u201dSimon slightly turned his head to look at how other groups were doing.Like they had the same thoughts, he could see the Combat Magic aspirants, who struggled to find a group, confidently bringing out their opinions. Most of the groups with Combat Magic aspirants seemed to make them the entering member.\u201cNope. I beg to differ.\u201dMeilyn returned to her calm face again and folded her arms.\u201cDid you forget it already? Only the entering member can attack the Cyclops directly. What are the methods of attack for the Combat Magic aspirants right now? Beating them randomly with Jet-Black reinforced fists? How can you use that to hunt the thick-skinned Cyclops?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cYeah, that is a problem.\u201dAs Camibarez and Simon agreed, Meilyn smirked and leaned back on her chair.\u201cThen do you have a means of hunting the Cyclops, Meilyn?\u201d\u201cOf course, Cami.\u201dShe smiled confidently and spread her palms out.A magic circle was drawn on the palm of her hand before black flames blazed and rose up. Camibarez exclaimed,\u201cDark Flare of jet-black elemental magic! Is this enough?\u201d\u201cAmazing! Being able to use this magic already\u2026\u2026!\u201dRick was displeased with Meilyn acting arrogantly, but he had to acknowledge the Dark Flare.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll explain my plan.\u201dMeilyn stopped the Black Flame and said while leaning forward,\u201cI\u2019ll burn the Cyclops with Dark Flare, and the three of you just go with cursing! If you guys keep stacking the exhaust curse to slow the Cyclops, I can cleanly burn it to ashes!\u201dRick crossed his arms and clicked his tongue.\u201cWith that plan, you\u2019ll be able to shine, but we\u2019re completely useless, aren\u2019t we? You, who\u2019s in charge of Curses, is set as the person entering, and you want us to only use curses like a machine behind you?\u201d\u201cThen what could be a better plan than this? Tell me.\u201dRick was speechless because he couldn\u2019t think of one right away, but he twisted the direction and attacked.\u201cTo begin with, that plan\u2019s prerequisite is that you can cast Dark Flare while dodging the Cyclops\u2019 attacks. Can you really dodge it?\u201d\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I dodge it?\u201d\u201cFrom what I saw, your physical strength was pretty damn poor. When we were running in Combat Magic, you were on the very end while huffing and puffing, and Professor Hong Feng had to help you because you couldn\u2019t even jump over the valley properly.\u201dThis time, Meilyn blushed.\u201cT-That\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026! No! Shouldn\u2019t you, who is in charge of the cursing, make sure to not let there be a chance of me being attacked in the first place? If I get beaten, your curses are just bad!\u201d\u201cCurses aren\u2019t our specialty to begin with!\u201dAs Meilyn and Rick were fighting like cats and dogs, Camibarez, who was caught in the middle, moved her head as she was flustered.Bam!The two flinched and turned their heads.Simon, who hit the desk with his hand, had a serious expression on his face.\u201cThen let\u2019s do it this way.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySimon gave an opinion.\u201cSo the problem is that Meilyn can\u2019t dodge the Cyclops\u2019 attacks, right? Then I can help her with Summoning magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How?\u201d\u201cSkeletons. I\u2019ll take out the undead to distract the Cyclops while Meilyn prepares a Dark Flare and attacks it.\u201dIt was undisputed that Meilyn\u2019s \u2018Dark Flare\u2019 was the most effective means of attacking in Group 7 right now.And if protecting Meilyn was a problem, Simon could make a move in terms of Summoning. Not only could he attract attention, but he could also receive the attacks directed towards her with his undead instead.\u201cOhh.\u201dMeilyn smiled a content smile.\u201cNow you\u2019re talking. So a special admission is a special admission, huh?\u201d\u201cNgh.\u201dA solution to the most important problem of Meilyn\u2019s survival seemed to be showing. There were no other good ideas, so Rick had to accept his role too.Meilyn turned her head, face lit-up.\u201cWhat about you, Cami? Are there any binding skills in Hemomancy?\u201dCamibarez scratched the side of her head and smiled.\u201cBlood magic is a versatile study, absolutely focused on offense so\u2026 I think it would be better for me to just use curses.Meilyn nodded, satisfied, and looked at Rick this time. Rick, who was squeezing out the idea, finally sighed profoundly and resigned,\u201cI\u2019ll train exhaust for a week.\u201d\u201cMhm, mhm. That\u2019s for the best of the team!\u201dSaid Meilyn as she became high-spirited. Simon comforted Rick with a smile.\u201cWe haven\u2019t finalized the strategy yet. We still have time until our next strategy assessment class, so let\u2019s keep thinking.\u201d\u201cY-Yeah.\u201dAfter answering with that, Rick saw Simon in a new light.The group leader was Meilyn, but it was Simon who coordinated the differences between the members and brought up the atmosphere like a real leader. And all the while, he also took what he could.If he could protect Meilyn, who was the core of the attack, with his undead, high evaluation in the teamwork grade was definitely guaranteed.As they discussed the specifics, the bell rang, announcing the end of the class. Jane got up and said,\u201cBy next class, prepare a 10-minute presentation on how to hunt the Cyclops. The role of each member and the dark magic used must be clearly stated in the document. That\u2019s all. \u201c\u201cThank you for the class!\u201dSimon\u2019s face, which was serious from the discussion, finally broke into a wide grin. The moment of a class ending was pleasant no matter how many times he enjoyed it.\u201cRun, Simon!\u201dSaid Rick while reaching into his bag.\u201cThere\u2019s a limited hamburger steak at restaurant 3!\u201dSimon smiled and stood up.\u201cI can\u2019t miss that.\u201d* * *After finishing the meal, Simon and Rick arrived at the lecture room for Poisonous Alchemy, where the last class of the day would be held.To be precise, it wasn\u2019t a lecture room, but a place called \u2018Poisonous Alchemy 2nd Lab\u2019, and large magic pots were placed under the writing desks.When Simon and Rick were unpacking their things while sitting somewhere in the middle\u2026\u201cHey! Merchant!\u201dMeilyn entered the lecture room wide-eyed. Camibarez was following next to her while smiling.\u201cYour information was wrong! You said there\u2019s a hamburger steak in restaurant 3, didn\u2019t you? It wasn\u2019t even on the menu!\u201dRick giggled.\u201cThat sold out in 5 minutes and was removed from the menu right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, so annoying.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you should\u2019ve run like crazy to the shortcut like me and Simon.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know such a way! Would it kill you if we moved together?\u201dRick waved his hand.\u201cWhat? You want to eat together with us too? That\u2019s too much. Let\u2019s not act like we know each other except in Beginner Dark Magic.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201dMeilyn said so and unpacked her things on the seat next to Simon.\u201cBut\u2026 there\u2019s nothing I can do until the Cyclops performance assessment. I\u2019ll make it clear. If you guys are uncooperative and drag down my grade, I won\u2019t just sit back.\u201d\u201cWoah, how frightening. You won\u2019t just sit back and what?\u201dAs she stood still speechlessly, Rick came over and pricked up his ears.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you closely! So what? What are you going to do? Calm down and say it.\u201dWhile snarling, she said,\u201cI-I\u2019ll curse you! I\u2019m going to place 100 cursed dolls in your room!\u201dRick laughed.\u201cBefore that, you\u2019ll either get caught in my information network and get arrested for breaking into the men\u2019s dormitory, or be found dead because of an angry Kajann Edvalt.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Kajann Edvalt?\u201d\u201cA certain someone.\u201dRick grinned and supported the back of his head with his arms.\u201cWho are they?!\u201dMeilyn was shouting at Rick to tell her, and Rick was teasing her that he won\u2019t. While they were quarreling like children, Camibarez and Simon\u2019s eyes met.She gave a smile with her eyes.\u201cHello~\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dAfter a while, other students came in, and the lecture room became full. Then, the professor of the Poisonous Alchemy entered the classroom too.\u201cEh- Who\u2019s the class president in this class?\u201dThe professor\u2019s name was Lang Strauss, an old necromancer with a skinny body, a bent back, and a wrinkled appearance.\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet!\u201d\u201cThen you do the greeting from now on.\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201dJamie Victoria stood up.\u201cEveryone, stand up! Bow to the professor!\u201d\u201cHello sir!\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Welcome.\u201dLang was the only professor in Kizen who made the students stand at attention and bow towards him. He slowly climbed up to the platform with his cane.\u201cSo what\u2019s your class\u2026 again?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re Class A!\u201d\u201cOh, right. Was this the first class for class A?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right!\u201dLang said as he opened the textbook,\u201cEh- Then everyone, please turn to page 1 of the textbook.\u201dLang then began to read the textbook in a slow tone.The impact was great. 10 minutes after class started, the eyes of the students started to droop.The destructive power of his way of speaking and slow class tension was truly outstanding. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that he almost liked spraying sleeping gas from his mouth.\u201c\u2026Eh- therefore- Poisonous Alchemy isn\u2019t just about handling the poison. Combining and arranging various potions to\u2026\u201dDozing.Rick\u2019s head dropped down all of a sudden. Simon let out a wry laugh and hit Rick with his elbow to wake him up.He got up in shock, but his head went down again in five minutes, making Simon\u2019s efforts be in vain.Under the guise of reading a textbook, a boring theoretical explanation continued for 40 minutes. Half of the students were resting their heads on their desks.Lang raised his head and said, \u201cEh- Then we\u2019ll try to make the low-grade poison potion written in the textbook\u2026\u2026\u201dAt last, a practical exercise! The students who were dozing off raised their heads one by one.The teaching assistants, who started working for the first time ever since the class began, moved quickly and put the potion ingredients in front of the students\u2019 desks.\u201cEh- Then we\u2019ll begin\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s see. Brewing a potion requires- a thorough- measuring and\u2026\u2026\u201dQuantitative regulation with a thorough measuring and putting order were the most important. Students accurately measured the materials with a gauger on one side.The assistants filled the pot with water and sliced in \u201cPoisonous Gurodan Mushroom\u201d and \u201cfrog\u2019s tongue\u201d.\u201cAnd the next is\u2014 Cough! Cough!\u201dSuddenly, Lang bent his back and began to cough violently.\u201cCough! Cough! Keeeeeeeugh! Kuegh! Kough!\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes popped out of their sockets from the surprise, and the assistant teachers rushed in to check Lang\u2019s condition. There was something like purple blood on his hand as he coughed.\u201cProfessor, you overstrained yourself. You should get some rest.\u201dSaid the assistant. Lang shook his head even though he was coughing.\u201cNo. That can\u2019t be. The class wouldn\u2019t run without me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be practical exercise now. We can conduct it under our control. You need to take care of your health.\u201dAfter being earnestly persuaded by the assistant teacher repeatedly, in the end, Lang went out of the classroom with the support of other assistant teachers.The students blinked their eyes, wondering what was actually going on.And instead of Lang, an assistant with red hair stood up on the platform. She let out a small sigh and found a male student who was still dozing off among the students.She lightly lifted the heavy textbook with one hand and threw it at the student.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Slam!The textbook crashed into the male student\u2019s desk, and he woke up in shock.\u201cEveryone, stand up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cStand up!\u201dThe students recovered their senses and jumped to their feet. The red-haired assistant folded her arms and glared at the students.\u201cWhat kind of rude attitude are you showing to the professor, Class A?\u201d\u201cSleeping on the desk because the class is boring? How can a rotten bastard like you guys be students of Kizen?!\u201dA tremendous force.Everyone stood up straight with a tense face. She stayed silent and put her hand on her forehead as if trying to cool herself.\u201cLet\u2019s keep the common courtesy to each other. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dThe students who were all of a sudden behaving took their seats. She let out a deep sigh and tied her hair up with a hairband.\u201cI\u2019m Professor Lang\u2019s assistant, \u2018Francesca Velmond\u2019. Starting now, I\u2019ll conduct the class on behalf of Professor Lang. The product for this exercise will be a low-grade poison potion. Please close your textbooks.\u201dStudents closed their textbooks with bewildered faces. She took the chalk and walked to the blackboard.\u201cThe most important factor in brewing a low-grade potion is the brewer\u2019s flexible response, not the variable control with the thorough measure and unification of steps. The water should be boiling in the pot by now. Add salamander power and barley power from the ingredient pack on your left.\u201dOne student raised their hand.\u201cHow much should we put in?\u201d\u201cThe quantity doesn\u2019t matter. Add as much as you want.\u201dSimon and the students freely put the materials in, following Francesca\u2019s instruction. Soon, Simon\u2019s magic pot turned green and started to smell bitter.\u201cNow, for the students who see blue smoke coming out from the pot, please raise your hand.\u201dAround half of the students raised their hands.\u201cThese students will make a poison potion with a paralyzing effect. What about the students with green smoke from the pot?The rest, including Simon, raised their hands.\u201cThe students with green smoke will brew a poison potion with an acute headache and hallucinogenic effects. It\u2019s useful against magicians or necromancers.\u201dThe students blinked and looked at each other. Indeed, this was know-how that wasn\u2019t found in textbooks or prior learnings.She stepped down from the platform and moved around the students, pouring out information like a rapid-fire cannon.\u201cStudents with green smoke, please take off your uniform jackets and hang them on your chairs. The assistants will prepare additional materials.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, it\u2019ll be the same steps for everyone. Use a ladle to remove the oil that\u2019s spreading in a light layer on the surface of the liquid. Vegetable fatty acids make the poison less potent.\u201d\u201cKeep stirring. You need to stir continuously until the potion develops some viscous consistency. If the heat is too strong, the potion may harden, so please be careful about controlling the fire.\u201dPerhaps because it was after Lang\u2019s class that just made the students sleepy, Francesca\u2019s class was colorful and even dynamic. She also passionately taught her students while dripping with sweat.Perhaps influenced by her skills and efforts, the students began to follow her, their eyes twinkling.\u201cMy potion has a yellowish color. Is this okay?\u201d\u201cA job very well done, Student. The slightly yellowish color is a special product among poison potions. That would be enough to be sold at Rochester.\u201dA potion that could be sold! Hearing the unexpected compliment, the student\u2019s face brightened up. Friends next to her congratulated her by tapping her with their forearms.\u201cI-I\u2019m Catherine Meyer! My pot had blue smoke at first, but it turned into green smoke!\u201cIt\u2019s because the ingredients on the floor rose up and the effect changed as you stirred with the ladle. I guess you\u2019ll have to change towards the hallucinatory effect. Teacher Hesse, please prepare the ingredients for the green smoke here.\u201dFrancesca began to look after the pots while walking around the students. Then, a female student raised her hand.\u201cI\u2019m Claudia Menzies! Professor, my potion seems a bit\u2014\u201dFrancesca\u2019s expression hardened up. Claudia soon realized that she had made a mistake and quickly covered her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m not a professor, Claudia.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Assistant Teacher!\u201d\u201cYeah, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201dHer anger didn\u2019t last any longer than that moment. Francesca instructed Claudia with her potion, a gentle smile on her face.When Claudia heard the explanation and added more Salamander power, Francesca even stroked her hair, saying she did well.\u201cHey, hey. Simon.\u201dRick leaned his head towards Simon and whispered quietly in his ear.\u201cI think I now know why the old geezer professor Lang survived in Kizen. The assistant is insanely capable!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dClaudia even started consulting about her major as she got hooked on Poisonous Alchemy.Simon was looking at Francesca softly answering Claudia, feeling an odd mix of emotions.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dThe class was now reaching its end.Francesca gave free time to the students who successfully completed the potion and taught the students who failed by giving them another chance.Simon, who succeeded in making the poison potion, was browsing through his textbook.\u201cSimon! Wanna prepare some of this for the Cyclops battle? Don\u2019t you think the poison potion will have some effect?\u201dSimon laughed because he was thinking the same thing.\u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to push your skills to the limit this week to face the Cyclops. Instead of taking class carelessly, make it your own and use it for the performance assessment.\u201dHe felt that all the class contents could be combined with reality.Certainly, Jane\u2019s skill in class was great.\u201cIdiot. Something like this won\u2019t work.\u201dThen, Meilyn approached with her arms folded. Camibarez also stood next to Simon with a smile on her face.\u201cLow-grade poison won\u2019t work starting from medium-sized monsters, let alone a cyclops.\u201cIs that so?\u201dSimon was browsing through the textbook without saying a word, but his hand stopped on a certain page.\u2018The ingredient is Lehark Mushroom?\u2019It was the mushroom that Anna Polentia sometimes used for cooking after neutralizing the poison.Simon kept his head down and read through the text.\u201cMeilyn, how about this?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dMeilyn came close and looked at the part Simon was pointing at.After being silent for a while, Meilyn lifted her head and ran to her seat.\u201cSimon! What page is this again?\u201d\u201c254.\u201dMeilyn hurriedly opened her textbook and began to read the contents seriously.\u201cGuys! If we can actually make this, I think it\u2019ll work!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the page Simon opened up, there was a description of the potion. It temporarily paralyzed the functions of the tendons and contracted the muscles.\u201cIt\u2019s named Nervie, apparently.\u201dMeilyn roughly circled the name of the potion.\u201cLooking at the symptoms, it\u2019s a neuroparalytic poison that weakens muscle strength, and it\u2019s written that it works equally well on small and medium-sized monsters of class 3 or higher. It won\u2019t show a dramatic effect, but it\u2019s going to slow down the Cyclops\u2019 movement for sure.\u201d\u201cHow do you apply it?\u201d\u201cEither let them drink or use it on the wounded area. I think it\u2019s going to work somehow if we throw the glass that contains the potion after making a wound.\u201dEveryone nodded with serious faces. It was good to have something ready to help them hunt the Cyclops.\u201cFor the magic pot, we just need to reserve a lab. The problem here is the materials\u2026\u201dMeilyn slightly bit her thumb as she looked through the list of ingredients written in the textbook.\u201cWe can obtain the basic ingredients easily at Kizen. The tricky ones are Lehark Mushrooms, Blood Slimes, and Silk Vines.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dRick glanced through the ingredients.\u201cIf I go down to Rochester and do some legwork, I might be able to obtain it somehow.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes widened. Rick nodded his head confidently.\u201cLet\u2019s just finish it while we\u2019re at it. I\u2019ll go down to Rochester later, after class.\u201dSimon, looking through the list of ingredients, pointed to an item with his finger.\u201cThis, I\u2019ve seen Lehark Mushrooms in Kizen.\u201d\u201cHm? Where?\u201d\u201cIn the Forbidden Forest.\u201dHe saw this mushroom when he went into the forest to find Pier. Many of them were growing under a large oak tree on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest.Meilyn and Camibarez\u2019 expressions slightly hardened up.\u201cHow do you know that\u2026? No, that\u2019s not the problem here! Are you planning to go to the Forbidden Forest?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long. Rick\u2019s also going to Rochester with the risk of getting himself into disciplinary action. I also have to do this much. I\u2019ll collect it before it gets dark.\u201d\u201cMmmm.\u201dMeilyn furrowed her brow.\u201cAren\u2019t there monsters too? Rochester might be fine, but the Forbidden Forest is too dangerous.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll follow him too!\u201dCamibarez raised her hand. Simon looked back at her with a bewildered face.\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, and you\u2019ll be breaking the school rules.\u201d\u201cAll the more reason why you shouldn\u2019t go alone! I can\u2019t just let you go to the Forest by yourself, Simon!\u201dSimon pondered deeply, but he couldn\u2019t come up with any excuses against a groupmate who wanted to tag along in the group activity.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s get out right away if it seems dangerous.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOkay, so I only need to get Blood Slimes and Silk Vines in Rochester, right? Lehark Mushrooms were the most difficult ones to obtain, so that\u2019ll save me some time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring basic ingredients and wait in the lab.\u201dAt that moment, the bell rang, announcing the end of class. Francesca, the Poisonous Alchemy assistant teacher, announced,\u201cOkay, today\u2019s class is up to here.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dThe students rushed out of the lecture room.Team 7 moved in a rush. They had a job to do. Rick to Rochester, Meilyn to the lab, Simon and Camibarez to the Forbidden Forest.While everyone was leaving the lecture room, a student who had been lying down in silence quietly got up from his seat.Then, he walked towards someone.\u201cHey, Hector.\u201dHector, who was quietly packing his things, looked up.\u201cI got some good information in. Would you like to hear it?\u201d* * *\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous if we go out from the front door. Follow me.\u201dRick took Simon and Camibarez to a stable on the outskirts of Kizen.\u201cKevin! You here?\u201dRick knocked on the door of the stable. The door opened after a while, and a middle-aged man with a tanned face stuck his head out.\u201cOh, Rick! You\u2019re going out today too?\u201d\u201cYeah, turns out to be like that. With these friends too, for today.\u201dRick flicked his fingers to toss a coin. Kevin smiled broadly and caught the coin in a skilled movement.\u201cPlease follow me, dear customers!\u201dSimon wondered why there was a stable in Kizen, but they were raising not only normal horses, but large skeleton horses too.As the skeleton horse roamed around while snorting and stared at them, Camibarez hid behind Simon in startlement.\u201cIt\u2019s right over here. Have a great time!\u201dWhere Kevin guided them to was the corner of the stable. It was just an ordinary space covered with straw, but there were no horses in this place.\u201cI\u2019ll be going ahead!\u201dRick walked towards the wall. Suddenly, the straw-covered floor sank down and Rick disappeared.\u201cHuh? What? Rick!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A voice saying, \u2018Over here!\u2019 was heard from under the floor.Simon and Camibarez\u2019 eyes met, and they walked to the spot where Rick walked up to.Soon, the bottom of the floor sank, and the two fell into the tunnel.Rick smiled with his arms wide open.\u201cWelcome to the secret route out of school!\u201dSimon looked around.\u201cA place like this existed, huh?\u201d\u201cHehe. Only a few people know this route.\u201d\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s hurry before it gets late.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRick, Camibarez, and Simon walked down the tunnel in that order. Rick, the leader, took out a lantern from his subspace and lit up the darkness, then guided them as if used to it.\u201cWatch your head!\u201dAt first, they could walk by bending their backs a little, but the passage became narrower as they proceeded. Soon, they came to a section where they had to lie on the floor and crawl on their knees.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Cami.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cW-Wanna swap positions?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dShe looked back at him with wide eyes as she was going ahead.As she was ahead, she looked back at Simon with wide eyes.After meeting eyes with her, Simon quickly turned his head and replied in a faint voice,\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201c??\u201dA rather embarrassing situation would occur if he looked ahead, so Simon quietly ducked his head and kept moving.Rick giggled as he noticed what was going on, but Camibarez didn\u2019t notice at all and tilted her head.It didn\u2019t take long before they reached their destination.Rick stood straight and tapped the ceiling. The ground opened after shaking like a lid.He climbed out skillfully and grabbed the hands of Camibarez and Simon, who were following him, and pulled them out.\u201cWoah, we\u2019re really outside.\u201dIn the distance, he could see the walls of Kizen. Rick put the lid back on and covered it with nearby soil so it wouldn\u2019t be obvious.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s separate from here. I\u2019ll go to Rochester now.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cTake care!\u201dRick headed for Rochester, and Simon and Camibarez walked towards the Forbidden Forest.Night in the forest came quickly. With a large full moon, darkness subsided through the leaves and the sounds of grass bugs and owls were heard. It was quite a spooky atmosphere, so Simon was worried that Camibarez would be frightened. However\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026Why does it look like she likes it?\u2019She was looking around freely with a twinkle in her eyes.She squatted, shaking the bloomed flowers in the field or sniffing the soil. She had a brighter and livelier atmosphere than when she was at Kizen.\u201cWalking at night is so much fun!\u201dSimon soon remembered that she was a vampire.\u201cSo, you like the night?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dShe looked back and smiled with her hands clasped behind her back.\u201cNights are cozy.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Are they?\u2019He couldn\u2019t really relate, but he decided to respect it as it could be a tendency of her race.Camibarez spoke to Simon like she had started feeling better.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit late for this, but thank you for helping me in the last Combat Magic class.\u201d\u201cAh, when you were trying to get on the back of a hippo?\u201d\u201cYes! I couldn\u2019t possibly go up on my own. I looked around because I was at a loss, but everyone turned their heads and pretended not to see me. It can\u2019t be helped since it\u2019s a competitive class, but only Simon willingly reached out at that time.\u201d\u201cI was just doing the right thing.\u201dShe put tension on her eyes and looked at Simon.\u201cThe fact that you can do the right thing is what makes it amazing!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I-Is that so?\u201dAs they were talking, they were already getting closer to the destination.A forest path like this was familiar for Simon, who ran through the rough mountains of Les Hill several times a day. Once he went there, he could remember it for a long time.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dSimon stretched out his hand. You could see mushrooms growing in abundance under the oak tree.\u201cAh, it\u2019s actually Lehark Mushrooms! There\u2019s so many!\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much we\u2019ll need, so let\u2019s just get everything.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dSimon took out an empty box and the two of them picked mushrooms and stacked them in the box.Within minutes of starting work, the box was full. Simon closed the lid and safely put the box back in the subspace.\u201cIt ended sooner than I thought.\u201d\u201cI know, right?\u201dThere was too much time left to wait for Rick. The two started moving after deciding to return to Kizen first and meet with Meilyn.\u201cAh! Come to think of it, why did you come to Kizen?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dSimon thought for a moment and said,\u201cWell, at first, I came here because of my parents.\u201cAh. Well, usually it\u2019s like that.\u201d\u201cAnd while going to school like that, little by little, I developed my personal consciousness and goals.\u201dHe was introduced to Summoning at school, and for the first time, he had the idea of wanting to become a Necromancer.On that, he found out about his father\u2019s secret and signed a contract with his father\u2019s undead Legion. He also made close friends.\u201cThen Cami, how about y\u2014\u201dAt that moment, Simon stopped talking. He also stopped Camibarez beside him with his arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cHide!\u201dSimon grabbed her wrist and led her behind the tree.In the distance, the light of a lantern was lighting up the forest\u2019s darkness. At the same time, the sound of rushing footsteps could be heard.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dCamibarez\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cIt\u2019s the Keepers of Kizen\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cKeepers?\u201d\u201cYes, they are the ones in ch-charge of guarding the surroundings of Kizen! They also manage the forest and reduce the number of monsters by hunting them. If we get caught by those people\u2026\u2026!\u201dShe gulped down her saliva.\u201cEven if we\u2019re in student protection period\u2026\u2026 we won\u2019t just get away without any consequences.\u201dWoof! Woof!You could even see hunting dogs. They were sniffing with their nose on the floor. As the light got closer and closer, you could also see people with bows on their backs.Simon\u2019s brow furrowed.\u2018That\u2019s strange.\u2019The timing was too good to think that a large-scale search by the Keepers started shortly after they entered the Forbidden Forest.Plus, Rick knew all the guards\u2019 schedules and he said that he only uses the times when their schedule is empty.In other words, this wasn\u2019t a regular search but a sudden one.\u2018Well, I\u2019ll think about it later.\u2019First, they had to focus on getting out of here.As Simon turned his head, he saw Camibarez trembling with a white face. She was muttering, \u201cWhat should we do, what should we do, what should we do,\u201d over and over again.\u201cCami. Look at me.\u201dSimon grabbed her shoulders tightly and made her turn towards him. He could see her terrified eyes.\u201cWe can get out of here. Just trust me and follow me. Keep running while looking at my back. You can do it, right?\u201dShe bit her lip and slightly nodded her head. Simon let her go and patted the skull-shaped badge hanging on his school uniform.\u2018Pier. Answer me.\u2019After a while, a blue flame rose up on the skull\u2019s eye sockets.[Hm? Did you call me, Boy!]\u2018Things got a little bit complicated.\u2019Simon, who was staring at the countless lights of the lanterns approaching, said to Pier with a determined face,\u2018It looks like the Legion will have to step in.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hunting dogs sticking their noses to the floor were closing on them.\u2018Come out.\u2019Simon took out a skeleton from the subspace. He gave it an order to stop and made it lie down on the grass.\u201cCami, this way.\u201dSimon grabbed Camibarez\u2019 trembling wrist and lowered his posture. After the lantern light passed them once, he ran, taking her towards a huge rock behind a tree.He then took out a new skeleton from the subspace and made it lie down. Currently, Simon was able to control up to two skeletons.\u2018I need to make use of everything I can.\u2019Simon picked up the stones on the floor and placed them into the subspace. He glanced around diligently to put as much situational information in his head as possible.Information such as how many Keepers there were, how many of them were carrying lanterns, the weapon used, the breed of the hunting dog, the habits, the terrain features, the direction of the wind, the sound of the river flowing.The dogs were still searching for now as Simon was upwind, but they never knew when or how the direction of the wind would change.Now was the time to decide.\u2018Now!\u2019Simon opened his eyes. The skeleton, lying under the tree, stood up and started running.\u201cThat way!\u201dThe Keepers responded immediately and the hunting dogs barked loudly, following the skeleton.\u201cOnly half chase! The other half, keep moving forward!\u201d\u201cThe other dogs are still sniffing!\u201dAs expected of a hunting expert, they didn\u2019t fall for the trick the first time. This time, Simon made the skeleton crouching on the rock run.\u201cThat\u2019s the real one!\u201d\u201cGet him!\u201dThe Keepers and hunters rushed to the side.\u201cCami, run!\u201dThat was the time. Simon and Camibarez, hiding behind the rock, turned their backs and ran.\u2018We couldn\u2019t completely get them off our trail. There are some on us!\u2019Simon looked back while running away. Some of the Keepers were chasing after them.\u201cHang in there, Cami!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWoof! Woof!The hunting dogs who caught the smell approached through the grass. No matter how fast a person was, they couldn\u2019t run faster than a dog.\u201cCami! Spray blood magic in the direction the dogs are coming from. Anything will do!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201dCamibarez cast dark magic while running. Fresh blood gushed out of the small magic circle that bloomed on the tip of her index finger.She twisted her waist and swung her arms back. Blood mixed with jet-black flew along with the wind and wet the grass.Woof! Woof woof woof!Grrrrrrr!The smell of vampire blood was strong enough to be used as a material for high-end perfumes.The dogs were excited by the strong scent of blood and started raging through the grass. During this time, Simon and Camibarez increased their speed and widened the distance.Thump! Thump!His heart raced like crazy because of the nervousness. He was a bit worried about Camibarez\u2019s stamina, but she too was running as fast as she could and followed Simon.\u201cOver there!\u201dThe lantern\u2019s light flashed over Simon and Camibarez\u2019 backs once.At the same time, the sound of the bowstring being pulled taut was heard.Thunk!Thud!As the arrows flew out of nowhere and hit the ground, Camibarez let out a short scream.\u201cTh-They really shot us! What should we do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dReplied Simon calmly.They saw our uniforms. There\u2019s no way the servants would hurt Kizen students.\u201dAs Simon said, the arrows were being shot far from the direction the two were running. It was prominent that they were firing a warning shot.\u201cThose bastards\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cStop! I told you to stop!\u201dWould you stop if it were you? Simon grinned and pulled the imaginary lever.Pow!A subspace opened from the floor, and the stones placed in earlier were poured out with maximum power. It was just a stone, but the Keepers running stopped, worried that it was dark magic.\u201cCami! This way!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThanks to Simon\u2019s wits, they earned a little more time.It seems that they ran haphazardly without any sense of direction, but in fact, Simon followed the sound of water. They finally reached the valley.\u2018Oh no.\u2019But of all the places, a cliff was there. A valley was flowing with a rippling sound below the distant cliff and the distance to the other side of the cliff was quite long.\u201cCami, do you remember that leaping technique you learned in Combat Magic? Can you use it?\u201dWith a pale face, she screwed her eyes shut and shook her head.She was one of two people who couldn\u2019t jump over the cliff in the Combat Magic class.Woof! Woof!But there was no time to hesitate. Even now, the barking of dogs and the lights of the lanterns was getting closer and closer.\u201cSimon, I\u2019m fine.\u201dCamibarez made a bitter smile and pushed Simon\u2019s chest away.\u201cPlease go ahead. I won\u2019t spill anything about you, Simon, even if I get cau\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201dSimon, who approached like lightning and picked her up, turned before running through the grass.\u2018The feeling of stepping on the jet-black!!\u2019Pooooooooow!Black smoke exploded from his tip of feet, and Simon flew through the sky.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A cliff\u00a0below, a large rising full moon above.The cold headwind and the thrill of having nothing under your two legs.Feeling a perfect sensation for a moment, Simon\u2019s body descended.Sliiiiide!He landed on the opposite side of the hill with a short gap, scratching the floor.Simon quickly ran down the ramp of the hill and put Camibarez down. Both of them pressed their bodies as close as possible to the floor.\u201cWhere are they?\u201d\u201cThey disappeared!\u201dA lantern light could be seen moving back and forth above their heads. The light that had been scanning the surroundings thoroughly for a few minutes soon disappeared.\u201cLet\u2019s try going that way.\u201d\u201cMove! They probably didn\u2019t run that far!\u201dWoof! Woof! Woof!The lights and the barking of the dogs went farther away, and soon, the presence of people disappeared completely. Simon could finally let out a sigh of relief.\u201cPhewww\u2026\u2026 Cami, Are you alright?\u201dSomehow, Camibarez had a completely blank face. Then, when she met her eyes with Simon, tears began to well up in her eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt anywhere\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI thought I really was going to be caught. Thank you. Thank you for saving me!\u201dSoon, she burst out crying. Simon patted her on the shoulder without saying anything.\u2018She said she\u2019s fine being caught even though she\u2019s this afraid?\u2019He could see a little bit of what kind of person she was.Camibarez calmed down after some time. The two got up and brushed off the dirt from their uniforms.\u201cLet\u2019s return. We\u2019ll have to walk around a bit to avoid the Keepers. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe two walked back into the dark forest.They decided not to turn on the lantern out of worry of being caught by monsters or Keepers.At least the moon in the sky was bright.About an hour had passed since they walked through the forest like that.\u2018\u2026\u2026And where the hell are we?\u2019As they walked frantically, it seemed that they had gone deeper into the forest than they had expected.The surrounding area was so spooky that it made him wonder if there was something like this in the forest. The trees that grew taller covered the night sky with their dense leaves, and eyes that could\u2019ve been beast or monster kept on appearing and disappearing.Their shoulders twitched at the frightening cries and their nerves were on edge.As if it would\u2019ve been better to just go to the Keepers, there was something in the midnight forest that stimulated the primordial fear of humans.Camibarez, a vampire, was also so frightened that she was looking around while slightly holding onto Simon\u2019s sleeve.\u2018I\u2019m sure I have the map in my head, but even I don\u2019t know where this place is.\u2019\u2018Have I been possessed by a ghost?\u2019No matter how much they walked, it felt as if they were going in circles.\u2018We\u2019re exhausted and we\u2019re getting colder and colder. What should I do?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201dSaid Camibarez, face pale.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear something?\u201d\u201cScreams of an owl?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dShe leaned closer to Simon and spoke in a voice drenched in fear.\u201cA sound of\u2026 a person\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon closed his mouth and focused his hearing.Certainly.It was vague, but audible.It was unclear if it was just a wild beast, a monster, or a human, but an indistinguishable voice could be heard repeatedly.\u201cLet\u2019s try going.\u201dHe heard that there were people who lived in the forest of Roke Island. If it was a person, they might be able to seek help. The two nodded and moved forward in search of that voice.\u201c#$#@%@^@.\u201dAs he walked, he concentrated on his ears. Little, little by little, the voice could be made out.\u201c@$%@^ pity us.\u201d\u201c$i+ remove the fat, @%#$^ almighty @ [email\u00a0protected] % mother.\u201dThe voice was cold, monotonous, and dry.\u201c [email\u00a0protected] ^ We worship you, oh holy @%@$$^.\u201dWhat kind of language was this?When he was focusing on the voice while frowning\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201dSimon was surprised.Camibarez had tears streaming down her face, drenched in fear, and still, the corners of her mouth were trembling while raised, which made her appearance a bit eerie.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Cami?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Run.\u201d\u201c#$^$#*# Glory to none other than mother @# [email\u00a0protected] #$^\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026We need to run.\u201d\u201cRun? What does that mean all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cUuh. Agh. Ahh. Aghhhhu\u2026\u2026!\u201dShe began to have seizures and floundered around. Simon grabbed her and ran to the opposite side of where the voice could be heard.But the voice just kept getting closer.\u201c@# [email\u00a0protected] # have mercy. Forgive the sins of the world #@$%@#.\u201dSimon, who was frantically walking through the bushes, finally arrived at the source of the voice.He could see an altar.Someone in a long gray robe was on the ground.Their arms were on the ground, palms facing the sky.Above the altar, unidentified objects and the internal organs of a beast were hung, and below it, a beast writhing with a dagger stabbed in its chest was offered as a sacrifice. All around it was colored red by the dripping blood.And, in the center of the altar, there was something big lying there.Simon knew what it was, but he couldn\u2019t believe it. Something that should never be on Roke Island.Something that should never be in Kizen.A cross.It was a cross. Why was a cross here?A naked woman was hung on the cross in a grotesque figure, thorn vines covering her body.The one who was prostrating under the altar lifted their upper body, recited the prayer, bowed down their body to the floor again, and raised their palms to the sky.Simon felt his blood all over his body run cold.\u2018\u2026\u2026A priest!\u2019A priest in Kizen.It was kneeling, bowing, and reciting prayers in the territory of Kizen.\u2018We need to run.\u2019They saw things they shouldn\u2019t have.It\u2019d be over if they got caught.Seeing this scene, Camibarez couldn\u2019t move out of sheer terror. Fortunately, she covered her mouth with both hands, so the sound didn\u2019t leak.At that moment, when Simon wrapped his arms around her shoulders and was about to return\u2026Rustle.There was a sound as the grass on the ground was trampled on. The movement of the praying priest came to a halt.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile feeling his throat going dry, Simon slowly turned his head to look back.The priest was staring at Simon\u2019s side while standing.The light in their eyes seemed to gleam in the darkness formed from their robe.Simon placed strength in his legs.\u201cRun!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, the horrifying swoosh of air ripping was heard from behind them.Thuud!Thunk!A series of black crosses nailed the ground, creating a large pit. Simon\u2019s eyes widened sharply.\u2018\u2026\u2026A priest is using jet-black?\u2019Simon felt that the situation had gotten much worse.It wasn\u2019t just that a Priest had sneaked into Roke Island.\u2018\u2026\u2026There\u2019s a traitor inside Kizen!\u2019Simon had two reasons for deducing that.First, divinity and jet-black were forces that collided with each other, so only one of them could be used.Second. The Priest was using jet-black instead of divinity.That meant that the Priest wasn\u2019t from outside, but was a person working inside Kizen.Most likely a spy from the Union of Divinity who was trying to steal the information of Kizen.No one prayed to God in Kizen. Therefore, that Priest had to go to the depths of the Forbidden Forest, where no one could see them make their prayer.And unfortunately, Simon and Camibarez happened to witness it.In other words, to draw one clear conclusion,\u2018We\u2019ll definitely be killed if we get caught!\u2019Swoooosh!Swoooooosh!The crosses made of jet-black poured down indiscriminately. The pain surged up as blood splattered on Simon\u2019s arms and legs\u2018Huff! Huff!\u2019Simon\u2019s eyes widened as he ran while exhaling a rough breath. Out of nowhere, he saw something in front of him that moved like a snake.\u201cWatch out!\u201dSimon shouted and bent his back. A black chain made of jet-black suddenly appeared and grazed Simon\u2019s hair.Simon raised his back again and looked to his side.\u201cAre you alr\u2014!\u201dShe was being taken away.\u201cS-Simon!\u201dHer legs were chained. The two quickly stretched out their arms, but they couldn\u2019t reach each other and just waved their arms in the air.\u201cKugh!\u201dSimon panicked and dashed out.When he went close, she was out of cold as she bumped into a tree and black chains tightly bound her body.\u2018Cami has been caught!\u2019Simon clenched his teeth and looked back.A priest in a robe was slowly approaching. The darkness of the pressed hood was too thick to see their face.Because of the baggy robe, gender or body information couldn\u2019t be inferred. There was very little information that could be gleaned from their appearance.That moment, the Priest raised their left arm.Rush!Immediately, Simon ran with jet-black and hid behind the tree. The storm of chains hit a tree and bounced off.Bwoong! Bwoong! Bwoong!Perhaps the Priest was quite powerful. More than a dozen crosses spread out in the air simultaneously this time.To materialize the cross, which symbolizes the Priest, with the power of jet-black, which symbolizes the necromancer. Simon felt a sense of difference that couldn\u2019t be explained.As the Priest turned their palms to the ground, the crosses poured out in unison.\u2018Ugh!\u2019Simon pulled out the skeleton\u2019s short sword from the subspace and dashed.Crosses hammered themselves to the floor like tombstones. And, at the unavoidable timing, a black trail crashed towards Simon\u2019s side.Clang!Simon immediately swung his short sword and struck the cross away. The short sword shattered as a tingling sensation hit his wrist.Flutter!This time, the chains flew from the left and right at the same time.Simon immediately lowered himself to the point where he was about to kiss the ground to dodge, and then grabbed a stone.\u2018Jet-Black Enchantment!\u2019Wooosh!Simon, who had dyed the stone black by flowing in jet-black, raised his upper body and threw it with all his might.Whiiish!Simon looked at the flying stone with an eager heart.\u2018Please reach! Reveal your face!\u2019Perhaps they didn\u2019t expect Simon to fight back. The Priest moved their head a little late. The hem of the hood on the right was slightly torn, but unfortunately, that was it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough you couldn\u2019t see their face, it felt like you could feel a wave of deep anger from the Priest.More crosses floated in the air. Simon stood up to dodge them, but the spread of the crosses went past his front and reached the top of Simon\u2019s head.I can\u2019t\u2026 dodge this.\u201cPhewww.\u201dSimon closed his eyes and raised his arms in resignation. And then\u2026\u2018Now!\u2019A huge greatsword appeared from behind the Priest.Slaaaaaaaaaaaam!With a deafening roar, the Priest\u2019s body was pushed away.It avoided being cut in two by encircling the jet-black like a shield, but all the crosses being cast were scattered or fell on the floor, leaving some ashes.[Kuhehehehe! Are you okay, Boy?!]Pier appeared, emitting ferocious blue flames from both of his eye sockets.A huge height of over 2 meters tall, a shapeless cape that flapped around his back, and a pure white greatsword in his hand.The Priest seemed to be utterly perplexed with the sudden appearance of the ancient-level undead.\u2018Pier!\u2019[Stay back! It\u2019s a tough opponent for the current you!]Pier took a stance where he put his huge greatsword to the side of his face. Simon obediently nodded his head.\u2018I\u2019m counting on you!\u2019[Kuhahahaha! It\u2019s been so long since I had a battle! Now, here I come!]Pier stepped on the ground.The ground shattered, and his body dashed in like a bullet. The Priest also formed a shield made out of jet-black in front.Tuuuuuuuuuuung!!As the shield and greatsword clashed, the air howled, and the ground turned over. The surrounding trees flew up to their roots.It wasn\u2019t a battle at the level where Simon could intervene yet.After giving up, he turned his back and ran to Camibarez. She was sitting down on the ground, as if Pier\u2019s surprise attack canceled not just the cross, but the chain too.\u201cCami!\u201dFortunately, she had just lost consciousness from the shock. There were no apparent wounds.Simon carried her into his arms. He\u2019d felt it the whole time, but her body was light enough to make him worry.Stooomp!As large rock debris fell to his side, Simon inched a little further back. The surrounding terrain was changing every time Pier and the Priest clashed.\u2018Pier! How is it?\u2019[Kugh! It\u2019s not easy!]Pier\u2019s voice was shaking.[This bastard! He\u2019s absurdly strong, even with jet-black magic alone! They might be at a professor level!]Even if it was an ancient undead, his strength was greatly reduced since he had only just been released from the seal.Above all else, Pier was a Marshall of the Legion, not combat personnel. If the opponent was indeed a Professor of Kizen, It would inevitably become a difficult battle.\u2018There\u2026\u2019Simon bit his lip. He couldn\u2019t afford to just lose his father\u2019s undead in vain like this.\u2018There must be some way\u2026!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon, who was looking for a way to overcome this situation, widened his eyes for a moment.\u2018Pier! Stay away from the Priest! And buy some time while making some noise!\u2019[What?]\u2018There\u2019s no time to explain! Hurry!\u2019As if he trusted Simon, Pier didn\u2019t give any comment and started to distance himself from Priest. Then, he swung his greatsword, causing the ground to roar and he slit the air, an explosive bang ringing out.From the Priest\u2019s point of view, it would seem like he was wasting his power, but this was the only way to live right now.And, soon after,\u201cOver there! I heard a sound from there!\u201d\u201cIt sounded like an explosion, didn\u2019t it?\u201dA light could be seen in the distance. Simon clenched his fist.\u2018It worked!\u2019Hearing the noise, the Keepers arrived.They were to be feared a few hours ago, but at least for now, Simon was so glad to meet them.The Priest, who was cornering Pier, also found the lights of the Keepers.From the Priest\u2019s point of view, the more eyewitnesses there were, the more complicated the situation would be. The Priest stopped the fight with Pier and, in the end, ran into the forest.\u201cDon\u2019t chase, Pier!\u201dSimon came running. Pier grinned as he gasped for breath with his greatsword sticking on the ground.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d[This much isn\u2019t even a problem! Other than that, I think we\u2019ll get into another problem if we stay here.]\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201dThe sound of footsteps of the hounds and the lights of the Keepers were drawing near.Pier picked up Simon and Camibarez at once.[We\u2019re going to get out of here! Hold on tight!]Pier flew off the floor.The surrounding terrain disappeared beneath them at a tremendous speed.* * *Pier took the two out of the Forbidden Forest to a point where they could see the walls of Kizen.[I can\u2019t go further from here on out.]Said Pier as he put the two of them down.[This uncomfortable smell\u2026 It looks like they have wide-range detection magic.]Simon nodded his head. Camibarez was still unconscious and hadn\u2019t woken up.\u201cThank you, Pier. You saved our lives.\u201d[Kuhehe! It hasn\u2019t been that long yet since I got a new contractor. I can\u2019t afford to lose you right away! Be careful on your way back!]\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dPier disappeared into the darkness.If he entered through the main gate, he had to explain the situation to the guards, so Simon went through the stable\u2019s tunnel and passed through the wall, just like he did when he first set out.Simon soon climbed the ladder, pushed away the straw from the ceiling, and raised his head.\u201cOh, you\u2019re back?\u201dKevin, who happened to be giving water to the horses in the stable, saw Simon and smiled.\u201cIs Rick back already?\u201d\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t come this way because Keepers were suddenly swarming. If it\u2019s Rick, he might be looking for another route to go around.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you for telling me.\u201d\u201cIs that missus alright?\u201d\u201cShe just strained herself a little because of being chased by the Keepers. She\u2019s alright.\u201dSimon gave a tip by flicking a coin from his pocket like Rick did. It was a tip meant to keep this a secret.Kevin smiled broadly and bowed his head.Simon came out of the stable and thought of where he should go.Should I go to the central ward? However, I\u2019ll be questioned about how I got hurt, and if I tell the truth, it\u2019ll eventually reach the ears of professors and officials.A battle at midnight. The Priest may have Simon\u2019s face, but it was possible that they hadn\u2019t seen Camibarez\u2019 yet.In order not to put her in danger again, the person who could treat her had to be trustworthy.\u2018A trustworthy person\u2026\u2026\u2019It would be safest for him to go to Nefthis, but he didn\u2019t even know where she was now.After much deliberation, Simon started to walk.* * *Kizen Male Student Dormitory Building 1, night-duty room.\u201cYaaawn\u201dLena, the dormitory manager, was lying on her stomach with her arms on the desk, yawning.\u201cI hate doing night dutyyyyyyyyyy\u2026\u2026\u201dCleaning and laundry, cleaning and laundry, cleaning and laundry. Of course, her main job was managing the dormitory, but she could never get used to taking care of the noble young masters, no matter what.She made a wry laugh as she looked at one document that was left lying about.\u201cBringing female students to the dorm room and three-on-three to do what? Ugh, these crazy bastards\u2026\u2026\u201dKids these days had nothing cute about them.It was also absurd to see them threatening her while mentioning their family when she said that she\u2019d report it to the professor in charge rather than overlooking the incident.\u201cAh, I just wanna quit everything nowww\u2026\u2026\u201dKnock Knock.At that moment, a knock was heard at the door.While rubbing her eyes, she said,\u201cI wonder what it is at this late hour.\u201d\u201cPlease come in.\u201dClick!When the door opened, a boy came in with a girl in his arms. Lena jumped up from her seat with her eyes wide open.\u201cA-Again, a female student on male dormitory! What do you think you\u2019re\u2014!\u201dLena, who was shouting in agitation, realized that the male student was familiar in her eyes. Besides, his uniform was covered in dirt and bloody wounds.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 S-Simon?\u201d\u201cPlease help me.\u201dSaid Simon in a labored voice. Lena rushed over and cleared the items off the bed of the duty room. Simon put Camibarez down on the bed.\u201cHow did this happen? You should\u2019ve brought her to the ward instead of here\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit complicated.\u201dSimon\u2019s face hardened.\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you the details, but I can\u2019t take her to the ward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d4 years of being the dormitory manager of Kizen.She survived 4 years in this infamous place where 95% of people come in after seeing the high salary of being a servant and escape within a month.During those times, Lena really went through all sorts of things, and she knew about the darkness of Kizen. The students did everything they could to survive in Kizen.Yes. Really. Everything they could.It was very common in Kizen to not go to the ward to avoid consequences, even if they were injured.She let out a deep sigh.\u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLena pushed Simon\u2019s back. Simon spoke in bewilderment.\u201cW-Wait Lena! I\u2019m\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI need to treat the female student, so get out!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Simon was scratching his head awkwardly, Lena grabbed the emergency first-aid kit, placed it next to the bed, and drew the curtain so Simon couldn\u2019t see.After a while, the sound of Camibarez\u2019s uniform being taken off could be heard.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sigh.\u201d\u201cBe honest. What happened? There are wounds like scrapes and skinned knees, but this wound on her thigh\u2026\u2026\u201dHer voice went cold.\u201cIt looks like a cut from a sharp object.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lena spoke calmly after looking at Camibarez\u2019s wound once again.\u201cYou fought with other students, didn\u2019t you? It\u2019d be better to deal while you\u2019re still on the student protection period if you have a problem. It\u2019s not something to be brooding over by yourse\u2014\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t fight with a student.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t tell the truth. That they were attacked by a Priest who betrayed the Kizen. It was a secret that could shake the entire organization called Kizen and could put Lena in danger because of it.\u201cThen what was it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you everything because it\u2019s a little bit complicated. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLena pressed her hand to her forehead with a hard face. She could see Simon\u2019s silhouette bowing down his head.In fact, she knew it from her long experience. Nothing would change, even if a servant interfered with the students\u2019 affairs.\u2018For now, treatment comes first.\u2019She pulled out a first aid kit and several medications from the drawer. She wiped off the blood with gauze and skillfully disinfected the wound.Camibarez, still asleep, groaned while frowning. After disinfecting, Lena applied the slime ointment that regenerated wounds so scars wouldn\u2019t remain and placed the band-aid.Fortunately, she had no huge injuries. The most severe injury, her thigh, was covered with bandages. Her sleeping expression became more relaxed.\u201cSimon.\u201dLena came out after pulling the curtains open.\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Yes? What?\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes shook. She folded her arms with an expressionless face.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a look at your wound, right? Take off your top.\u201d\u201cAh. Okay!\u201dSimon took his school uniform off while thinking that he was getting startled quite a lot today. He took off his jacket and shirt and rolled his school pants up to his knees.\u201cI\u2019ll disinfect you first.\u201dLena crouched in front of Simon after putting disinfectant on the cotton.\u2018Mmm.\u2019Blood flushed to her face when she saw Simon\u2019s naked body.\u2018I mean, why does a student have this great body.\u2019\u2018What are those abs at that age?\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Ugh. So embarrassing. Calm down, heart.\u2019There was this thing called an adult\u2019s pride. She couldn\u2019t have indecent desires against a minor who was still wet behind the ears.After pulling herself together, she disinfected the wounds in a professional manner. During that, Simon groaned in pain and twisted his body.\u201cUggh! It hurts so much!\u201d\u201cBear with it.\u201dSaid Lena while slapping Simon\u2019s leg. Looks like a kid is a kid, judging from his whines.After disinfecting the wound, she spread the ointment well and wrapped it with a bandage.\u201cThe wound might get infected, so it would be best not to overdo yourself for a while.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dSimon bowed down respectfully.A student bowing towards a servant. Lena took a step back in slight surprise and then cleared her throat.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to you today\u2026\u2026 but there\u2019s nothing more important than your health. Your body needs to be healthy to survive in Kizen. You get what I mean, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThe female student is also fine. I\u2019ll ask the people I can trust in the female dormitory and take her silently.\u201cThank you very much! I\u2019ll never forget what you\u2019ve done for me.\u201dSimon once again bowed down respectfully.After Simon went out of the night-duty room, Lena sighed and sat down on the chair.\u2018\u2026\u2026I might be able to see him for a long time.\u2019She thought that he was a down to earth boy. That was rare in Kizen.A strange feeling lingered on her.* * *\u201cS-Simon! So you were alright!\u201dAs Simon entered the dormitory room, Rick, who had been anxiously roaming around the same place, ran up to him.\u201cWhat in the world happened?! How\u2019s Cami?\u201dSimon calmly explained what had happened.The story where they were chased by Keepers, went deep into the forest, and got lost.Of course, he didn\u2019t share the part about the Priest. He thought that he should discuss this matter with Camibarez separately.Rick also arrived a little late to get past the Keepers, and he said that Meilyn, who was left alone in the lab, was shaking with anger and sadness. Of course, she seemed to understand when he explained that Keepers were around.In the end, Rick was also able to acquire the ingredients in Rochester, so it seemed like they could make the potion tomorrow.Thud!\u201cWhoa, that startled me!\u201dThe door opened roughly and Kajann Edvalt came in.A towel was placed over his wet head like he\u2019d been to the bathroom.\u201cYou\u2019re back, Kajann?\u201dSimon greeted him with a smile.He tossed off his uniform without answering, climbed up to the bunk bed, and laid down with the blanket covering up his head.And within a minute, you could hear snoring.\u201c\u2026\u2026I really don\u2019t understand him at all.\u201dRick shrugged and went to his bed. Simon also grabbed his blanket and went to his bed after looking at Kajann sleeping.The day was extremely tiring.* * *The next morning.Simon was waiting at the building entrance, leaning his back against the wall after telling Rick to go to the lecture room first.As the familiar Class A students passed by, he saw Hector and his faction walking. They looked at Simon with slightly surprised faces and talked in whispers.\u2018She\u2019s late.\u2019Simon\u2019s face started to fill with anxiousness as he looked at the wall clock. The time for class was drawing near, but Camibarez wasn\u2019t showing up.\u2018What\u2019s happening? Is she that hurt? Or is she not coming to the class because she\u2019s so shocked by what happened yesterday?\u2019In fact, it was so frightening that his hair stood on end when he recalled the Priest praying in the Forbidden Forest last night. He also had some nightmares.At least Simon was used to looking at someone praying since his mother was a priest, but it had to have been a much larger psychological shock for Camibarez.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll have to pass by the girl\u2019s dormitory after class\u2026 Hm?\u2019At that moment, He saw a female student with a bag passing next to him. She had a really familiar face. She smiled broadly as she met her eyes with Simon\u2019s.\u201cAh, Simon! Good morning!\u201dCamibarez trotted towards Simon. Compared to what Simon expected, she looked energetic.\u201c\u2026\u2026Let me see you for a second. Cami.\u201dThe two moved to a quiet, vacant park behind the building.\u201cYou must\u2019ve been surprised yesterday. Are you really okay?\u201dShe slightly nodded her head.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. It just feels like\u2026 I was dreaming.\u201d\u201cDreaming?\u201dA pleasant night walk after a long time.That time when she was picking mushrooms with Simon in peace.That time when they were running away after being chased by the Keepers.That time when Simon carried her and jumped off the cliff.And lastly, that moment when she faced that indescribably terrible Priest.\u201cIt feels like I woke up after the memory was cut off when the dream turned into a nightmare\u2026\u2026 How should I put this? Like I can\u2019t feel the sense of reality.\u201d\u2018Is the shock less because she perceived it like she was dreaming?\u2019Whatever the case was, Simon was relieved that she looked okay. Simon went straight to the point.\u201cThe Priest ran away after seeing the keepers. There\u2019s a high chance that they haven\u2019t seen your face yet.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else and just act as usual. I\u2019ll find out who the Priest is.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, she came closer to Simon and stood on her tiptoes.\u201cI want to help too, Simon!\u201d\u201cH-Hm?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too mean to put me out of this case because my face wasn\u2019t discovered! This is for both of us!\u201dSimon was a little startled by her spirit and leant back.\u201cR-Right. Okay. I\u2019ll ask for your help when that time comes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJust then, the bell rang, announcing the start of class. The two ran to the lecture room in a hurry.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The first class was Bahil\u2019s Curses. The class was so hectic that he\u2019d completely forgotten about what happened last night in the Forbidden Forest. Bahil finished explaining the theory and went straight to practical exercises.\u201cI saw a lot of students depending on the rectifying tool in our Exhaust class the other day, so this time, we\u2019ll practice with an easier curse.\u201dThe \u2018Curse of Transmitting\u2019 used the formula that was the basis of all curses, which attached the jet-black to the target creature. The objective of this class was to make the magic circle of this curse float in the air without the rectifying tool.\u2018Hrrrrrrf.\u2019Simon raised his concentration and spread his palms facing each other.Like holding a large fruit in your hands.Now, he had to draw a magic circle in the air by flowing jet-black in from both palms.Simon\u2019s dark-blue jet-black flowed out and drew a \u2018circle\u2019, the basic step of the magic circle.\u2018\u2026\u2026Even the beginning is tough.\u2019After, with difficulty, placing the circle that later would be the base, he drew a rune in its center.Of course, it didn\u2019t go as well as he had planned. The base repulsed and trembled as he tried to add the rune, and his hands shook as if he had tremors.Even though it was quite inept, Simon wrote the runes and formulas. Originally, it was supposed to look like a picture from a copy machine, but Simon\u2019s magic circle was a shape where the letters were wriggling as if alive.\u2018Ugh.\u2019He decided to try casting the magic with it first. A tall vertical plant was placed on his desk.It was a plant that grew by consuming jet-black, and it\u2019s said that, if the Curse of Transmitting succeeded, flower buds bloomed from its body. Simon activated the magic circle eagerly.\u201cBoom!\u201dHowever, the magic circle dispersed instead of activating.Simon sighed in frustration.\u2018It\u2019s not easy after all.\u2019He had no time for this when they had to hunt the Cyclops next week right away. Simon clenched his teeth and spread the palms of his hands again.\u201cHow is it? Is it doable?\u201dSimon felt a warm hand on his shoulder at that moment.When he turned his head, Bahil was there, smiling. Simon replied tensely.\u201cAh, yes! I\u2019m trying my bes\u2014\u201d\u201cManagement of the core.\u201dSimon stopped speaking.\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re inexperienced with managing the core. The concentration of jet-black is lowered, and therefore the magic circle isn\u2019t constructed properly.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s heart started racing. It was a part where he kept feeling his limits, but it was a completely different feeling to hear it directly from a Professor of Kizen compared to thinking it by himself.\u201cThere\u2019ll be no place to learn how to properly manage the core. It\u2019s too basic to be taught at Kizen, and each person has a different management method.\u201dBahil raised his index finger from the hand that was touching Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201dHe then pressed Simon\u2019s shoulder with his index finger.Drop.In an instant, his mind went blank, and he could hear the sound of water dripping. The noise of the surrounding students disappeared like magic, and Simon\u2019s body drifted to the empty world, far from the classroom.\u201cThere\u2019s a prejudice that curses are only harmful. As a person who\u2019s in this field, it saddens me.\u201dSaid Bahil with a bitter laugh.Perhaps it was because the noise around him had disappeared. His voice could be heard very clearly.\u201cProfessor, this is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t be surprised. With the modification of the Sense Curse, I simply maximized your senses. Now, focus again.\u201dWith Bahil\u2019s voice resounding softly, Simon somehow felt at ease. He didn\u2019t seem like Bahil was going to do anything bad.\u201cTake a deep breath and try to collect the mana from the air into your body.\u201dAs instructed, Simon drew the mana into his body. This time, Bahil also placed his left hand on Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cNow, we\u2019re going to pass the mana through the core. First, take a look at how I do it.\u201dAmong the mana in his body, he felt a string of mana that he couldn\u2019t control. It went into the core under the heart.However, it didn\u2019t pass through the core as is. The mana rotated along his core and underwent a profound process of change.\u201cSimon, your jet-black is different from ordinary people\u2019s. The image of simply extracting it will inevitably lower the efficiency.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCirculation.\u201dThe mana rotating in the core naturally turned into jet-black and was discharged to the outside. It was an image reminiscent of the corona of a black hole.\u201cAbandon the image of transformation, modification, and falsification. Think of the core as a living creature and lead it gently. Wait for the jet-black to fall outside naturally.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, Simon.\u201dSimon nodded his head and focused on the mana in his body.Circulation, not transformation. An image of circulation.Simon imaged the words that repeated in his head over and over again with mana. As if responding to his will, mana streamed into his core and began to flow.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to strain yourself to control the core. Just relax, and contemplate. Let this child do whatever it wants.\u201dJust like Bahil said, the core really moved with its own power. As the core circulated the jet-black, it drew in the mana around it, and the jet-black got stronger as well. Soon, the inside of the core became full and emitted jet-black to the outside.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026!\u2019Finally.The black sun\u00a0was completed in Simon\u2019s body.\u201cGood job! Then, shall we try dropping the senses to 50% this time?\u201dThe blurred vision came back to normal. From a feeling of complete isolation, he could now hear the noisy voices of the students sitting next to him.\u201cNow, try again.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSimon repeated it over and over again. The first attempt was unsuccessful as the jet-black didn\u2019t move as freely as when his senses and concentration were maximized, but he got the hang of it on the second and succeeded on the third try.\u201cJet-black has a tendency to remember.\u201dSaid Bahil while tapping his forehead.\u201cJust like the hands and feet of humans. If you repeat the same movements hundreds of thousands of times, the jet-black tries to reproduce the acquired flow without realizing it. Isn\u2019t it amazing? That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to practice repeatedly and develop the right habits.\u201dSimon felt great.A feeling of enlightenment being engraved in your head.He thought Bahil was just a cold and calculating person. Simon thought that he was seeing a new side of Bahil.\u201cNow then, while we\u2019re at it, shall we try performing the curse too?\u201dSimon\u2019s senses were maximized again with Bahil\u2019s voice. All other distractions disappeared, and he was able to focus on himself, the jet-black, and the plant in front of him.\u201cTry stirring up the jet-black.\u201dWith Bahil\u2019s voice, Simon raised his hands facing each other. Jet-black flew out of his fingertips like paint.\u201cRest assured. I\u2019m assisting you. Please complete the magic circle the way you like it.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dIt was a completely different feeling than when he was doing it alone. Since the magic circle floating in the air was perfectly centered without being shaken, Simon was able to create as much jet-black as he wanted in peace.It was a wonderful feeling. The magic circle was completed in an instant, to the point that him struggling a few minutes ago seemed ridiculous.\u201cAnd then, activate it!\u201dAs soon as his senses returned, Simon opened his eyes and activated the magic circle.A single ray of jet-black, resembling a lightning strike, went out with a flash and hit the plant.Fwaaaaah!Then, a spectacular view spread out.Numerous flower buds bloomed profusely like an explosion from the plant\u2019s body.The flowers already covered Simon\u2019s desk and spread out around him. It was like Simon was instantly buried in the middle of a flower bed.\u201cWoaaaah!\u201d\u201cWhat, what is this?\u201dExclamations of students broke loose everywhere.\u201cP-Professor, this is\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cThis is the potential that you have.\u201dBahil spoke in a low voice that only Simon could hear.\u201cPlease don\u2019t get me wrong. I was only assisting you in making a stable output. This is a level that you\u2019ll be able to do by yourself in no distant future.\u201dWhat he\u2019s saying was true. It was indeed Simon\u2019s power that made the flowers bloom.\u201cYour jet-black is special, Simon Polentia.\u201dBahils\u2019 fingers, which were resting on Simon\u2019s shoulder, trembled. The blue flower that was growing even now was already covering Simon\u2019s entire torso.\u201cPlease think about it carefully.\u201dBahil\u2019s face turned serious.\u201cOn what would be the best way to blossom your talents. And in what direction to proceed to get 200% the advantage of this unique jet-black.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Very well. If I had to say something, you need to put more emotions in your curse.\u201d\u201cAh. Like when you\u2019re commanding your undead?\u201dFor an instant\u2026Was it his imagination that Bahil\u2019s expression turned cold?Simon blinked his eyes to see if he was seeing things, and Bahil had returned to his softly smiling face.\u201cYes, it\u2019s similar. Emotions are a crucial element of all dark magic after all.\u201dBahil put back down his hand on Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget what I told you earlier.\u201dWith the snap of Bahil\u2019s fingers, Simon could clearly hear the clamor of the surrounding students.Bahil patted Simon\u2019s head gently and turned away.\u201cProfessor Bahil!\u201dRick raised his hand. Bahil stopped and asked him,\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cC-Can you please assist me too? It\u2019s quite hard to bloom the flowers so\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an inferior\u2019s mindset to rely on luck and make things easier. Keep trying over and over again.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 yes.\u201dAs Rick lowered his hand, Meilyn, who was sitting next to him, smirked before snorting.Simon, who was filled with the aftertaste for a moment, strained his eyes and made his hands face each other.\u2018Alright. This time, by myself\u2026\u2026!\u2019And just like that, before the bell announcing the end of the class rang,Simon was able to perfectly master the \u2018Curse of Transmitting\u2019.* * *The next class was Hong Feng\u2019s Combat Magic.They were headed somewhere after riding the hippos again. The place Hong Feng chose for today\u2019s class was an open, empty park of bamboo forest.After warming up with hard running like usual, Hong Feng taught the students basic combat techniques such as punches and kicks.Everyone was stretching their jet-black-infused fists or feet, keeping a distance from each other. The assistant teachers went around and corrected the students\u2019 postures or taught them some know-hows on infusing the jet-black.And\u2026\u201cHere!\u201dSlap! Slap!\u201cPlace more force over here!\u201dSimon\u2019s face was flushed red as he took a stance. Hong Feng was hitting Simon\u2019s thigh with her palm.\u201cYour arm\u2019s position should be here! The opposite arm will become an axis when you stretch out your foot! Hold in your stomach! Hold in your stomach!\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dIt was a tough situation for Simon.It was natural for a professor to guide their students while touching them, but it wasn\u2019t easy to pocket his feelings in the situation where a beautiful woman like Hong Feng stuck close to a young boy in full vigor.\u201cSimon! Are you going to keep on relaxing your toes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dSimon quickly adjusted his posture to avoid being hit again. Hong Feng folded her arms and nodded her head as though she didn\u2019t find it that bad.\u201cAlright. Prepare for the spin kick.\u201dSimon moved his legs. The left foot came forward.\u201cJet-black management.\u201dHe rotated his body as the jet-black moved towards the center of his waist.His heel naturally lifted up, and the waist and body turned into the ideal posture. The folded right foot stretched out and\u2026Whooooosh!His leg passed through the air. The jet-black that flowed out from his feet left a long, black trail like paint.It was indeed a picturesque kick.\u201cWell done!\u201dHong Feng clapped her hands and smiled broadly. Simon bowed his head despite sweating profusely.\u201cYou\u2019ve succeeded in performing the spin kick, but four basic postures were ruined. You were looking in the wrong direction, you couldn\u2019t use the power in your waist, and you needed to spin your heels more. And\u2026 the timing in releasing the jet-black was too fast when hitting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d\u201cMhm! But still, you\u2019re doing good enough, Simon. Practice more!\u201dHong Feng tapped Simon on the shoulder and left to look after the other students.A short break was given.\u201cMmmmm.\u201dRick, who had been carelessly sitting on the grass, blearily opened his eyes.\u201cCami.\u201d\u201cYes, Rick?\u201d\u201cLike the Curses class, don\u2019t you think the professors seem to favor Simon these days?\u201dCami, who was modestly sitting next to Rick, covered her mouth and smiled.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much, is it?\u201d\u201cMmmm- Anyway, something\u2019s strange.\u201d\u201cGosh. You loser.\u201dMeilyn, in a gym uniform, approached, clicking her tongue.She had her sky-blue hair tied up with a string today, when it had been always down on her back.\u201cAnd you call yourself a Kizen student? Try to get yourself in the eyes of the professor by yourself if you have time to be unsightly jealous of others.\u201dRick chuckled.\u201cWhat do you mean jealous? I\u2019m just expressing my doubts. And you\u2019re not in a position to say that, are you, Meilyn who proudly lifted the curse and climbed up the hill during the Combat Magic class.\u201dMeilyn\u2019s face reddened.\u201cAgh! Stop bringing that up again and again. Honestly!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t wanna~ I\u2019m gonna keep bringing this up until it rots~ And have you talked to Professor Hong Feng during the class today? You\u2019re definitely out of her favor.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you be careful of being out of my favor before that?\u201dAs Meilyn raised her foot and threatened Rick, he laughed and rolled down the grass to run away.\u201cGood grief.\u201dAfter letting out a big sigh, she turned her head and looked at Simon.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou try teaching me.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon put on an expression asking where that suddenly came from. Meilyn blushed before clearing her throat.\u201cYou\u2019re good at Combat Magic. I\u2019m asking you to look at my posture since Professor Hong isn\u2019t coming to me.\u201d\u2018So that\u2019s what she meant.\u2019Meilyn got flustered and quickly added as Simon smiled without saying anything,\u201cY-You know that I\u2019m dealing with Cyclops during the performance assessment, right? My movements will improve with your cooperation, and so our performance assessment score will\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll teach you even if you don\u2019t say those things, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dSimon stood in front of her with a kind smile.\u201cTry taking the stance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn kept on clearing her throat in embarrassment and then muttered, \u201cThank you,\u201d so quietly that no one could hear it.Soon, she awkwardly took up the kicking posture. Simon squatted down and scanned her body up and down.\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u201cI-I know!\u201dYelled Meilyn.Simon stretched out his finger.\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re too stiff. Just by looking at your posture, it can clearly be seen that you\u2019re lacking in self-confidence. Relax your body a bit and try taking the stance again as naturally as possible.She nodded and stood comfortably. The stiff feeling disappeared slightly.\u201cPut your left foot a little further back, and both fists lightly clenched in front\u2026\u2026 No, that\u2019s your right foot. The left foot is the foot opposite to the hand you use when you\u2019re eating.\u201d\u201cI-I know that, dumbass! I was just confused because I\u2019m nervous!\u201dShe retorted, but she quickly changed her posture.\u201cStandby after gathering the jet-black around your waist. Yeah, that\u2019s right. And then, you put your strength in the ball of your foot and turn it.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cNo no. I\u2019m not telling you to turn it like you whirl a top. You have to turn it like you\u2019re twisting with your waist muscles. And when you turn, your jet-black should be on the back of your thigh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHere?\u201dSimon shook his head as she put her hand on her leg.\u201cA little higher.\u201d\u201cHere?\u201d\u201cNo, you went too much. A little bit lower.\u201d\u201cThis one, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just a knee.\u201d\u201cAh. Gosh! It\u2019s not even bare legs. I\u2019m in my gym uniform! Just touch it!\u201dShe burst out. However, in the fit of anger, her shout was too loud.Meilyn\u2019s voice echoed riding the mountain ridge, saying \u201cTouch it\u2026 Touch it\u2026 Touch it\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEars pricked up everywhere.The female students who were obsessed with love stories began to whisper. You could even see Camibarez covering her mouth gently.Meilyn blushed and flailed her arms violently.\u201cNo, no! That\u2019s not it! I\u2019m asking him to position me! Position!\u201dBut the truth didn\u2019t matter at this point.Watching the rumors spread rapidly, starting from the female students, Meilyn\u2019s expression went vacant.Then, she turned to Simon hurriedly.\u201cWh-What should we do? Go say something!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyways, I\u2019m gonna touch you since you told me to.\u201dSimon approached with big strides and precisely placed his hand on Meilyn\u2019s gym uniform.\u201cYou gather and place your jet-black here,\u201dHe then grabbed her ankle.\u201cand move it here while turning your body.\u201d\u2018You crazy bastard!\u2019Now wasn\u2019t the time for this!Simon spoke in a low voice as Meilyn\u2019s face had turned as red as it could and her lips started trembling.\u201cJust do as you\u2019re told.\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll cause the opposite effect if you are hopping mad. You need to show that it\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201dSimon stood up with a nonchalant face and grabbed her arms and shoulders, correcting her posture.Meilyn nodded with the confusion of the moment and fixed her posture. Those who came to see after hearing the rumors saw Meilyn.\u201cSo he was really fixing her posture, huh?\u201d\u201cMeilyn is quite odd after all.\u201d\u201cSimon\u2019s so kind~\u201dFinally, after correcting her posture, Meilyn turned and kicked her legs up to the sky. Her legs rose up with her strength, but she lost her balance and fell to the grass, landing on her butt.\u201cHahaha!\u201dA roar of laughter could be heard around them. Simon also smiled and placed his hand on his hips.\u201cYou still have a long way to go, but well done.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, yeah.\u201dAt that moment, the female students, who were observing them nearby, spoke to Simon. They were also asking Simon to teach them how to kick.Simon smiled kindly and corrected their posture.\u2018\u2026\u2026What\u2019s with this guy?\u2019Meilyn slightly bit her lips.The Combat Magic class ended after some time. Kizen had prepared the teleport magic circle this time too for the students, who had used up their stamina and lay down, exhausted.\u201cMeilyn! I heard the rumors!\u201dRick showed up giggling, resting the back of his head on his head. Meilyn, who was talking to Camibarez, glared at Rick.\u201cHey, don\u2019t do it. I swear.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not about you, but it\u2019s a story about my friend. So, we were talking about what kind of conversation a man and a woman would have had if words like \u2018touch\u2019 and \u2018posture\u2019 were being discu\u2014\u201d\u201cI told you not to do it!!\u201dMeilyn took out her bag from the subspace and began to beat Rick up.Rick screamed as he tripped into the grass as he tried to run away, and Simon and Camibarez laughed.\u201cUwaah! Uwaah! Don\u2019t just stand there and stop her!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Cami.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dThe two turned away from Rick and quickly went to line up for the teleport magic circle.\u201cBy the way, Cami, do you remember what our next class was?\u201d\u201cAh!

It was a class on destroying and restoring the Island Rat Man skeleton they made last time.\u201cThe greatest strength of the skeleton is its restorative ability.\u201dAaron, who\u2014as usual\u2014went to school in loose shorts with frizzy hair, raised his finger.Swish!Whoosh!The bones scattered around the lecture room gathered in the air at a tremendous speed.The skeleton assembled in the air landed on the floor in a span of a few seconds and even greeted them nicely, breaking loose cheers and applause from students.\u201cThe principle of restoration isn\u2019t hard. Even if the skeleton\u2019s body is shattered by a strong impact, some residual jet-black remains on the bones.\u201dAaron pulled out one of the skeleton\u2019s bones with his hand.\u201cYou just have to energize this jet-black to maximize the nature of the attraction to return to its original form.\u201dThen, when he loosened the grip of his hand, the bone flew away again and stuck to its original place like a magnet.\u201cNow, let\u2019s begin the practice.\u201dSince the content of the class was about restoration, Simon happened to be ready for it.While other students were practicing the restoration by separating the torso, arms, and legs, Simon succeeded in restoring the entire skeleton in one go.Not only Meilyn, but Hector also had difficulties in restoration.A field of thorough talent where you couldn\u2019t reach 100% with practice and training alone. Simon was unrivaled in Class A in terms of skeleton restoration.So Simon, who was always busy keeping up with the class, enjoyed the leisurely time. He was jotting down notes on his textbook because he still had some time left, even after accommodating Rick and Camibarez\u2019s restoration.\u201cHey, are you sure you can just loaf around like that?\u201dGrumpily complained Meilyn.Instead of answering her, Simon waved his hand in the air. The bones scattered on the desk were put together and completed the skeleton\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026\u2026P-Pretty good.\u201dCat got Meilyn\u2019s tongue just like that. Rick, who was sitting behind her, laughed gloatingly before going quiet when he was warned by an assistant teacher passing by.\u201cD-Don\u2019t be so cocky just because you\u2019re good at restoration!\u201dSaid Meilyn, all guns blazing with her competitive spirit. She was the type of person who had to be 1st in every class to be satisfied.\u201cYou said you\u2019ll leave Kizen if you don\u2019t surpass my Summoning score next month, right? If you think I\u2019ll go easy because we\u2019re in the same group, you\u2019re hugely mist\u2014!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely surpass you.\u201dAnswered Simon while resting his chin on his hand and flipping through the textbook.She clenched her fists in frustration, but she wasn\u2019t in a position to say anything to Simon, at least not in this restoration class.\u201cSigh. If I had solved question 20, I\u2019d have a score of 90s in summoning too\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing her talking to herself, Simon raised his head.\u201cQuestion 20? You mean the problem on the last page?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThat was easy.\u201dHer middle of the forehead narrowed.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hey. Why are you acting so arrogant all of a sudden? Are you better than me at Summoning?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThen how did you solve question 20? Did you use the formula?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know such a thing.\u201dIt made no sense.Number 20 was a question to be solved by applying Theron\u2019s formula. Meilyn, who got the problem wrong, went to Aaron directly to hear the explanation.But Simon, who never had any prior learning, solved number 20 without knowing the Theron formula?\u201cWhat was your answer then?\u201d\u201c1,200,146.\u201dMeilyn\u2019s eyes widened sharply. The answer was 1,200,000 so he was practically correct.\u201cSpill it quickly! How the hell did you solve it?!\u201d\u201cI combined the formulas I learned in Kizen as much as possible. Mmmm, I can\u2019t explain it because I can\u2019t remember exactly what the problem was.\u201dShe bit her lip. She thought to herself that she\u2019ll make sure to make a copy of the problem and make Simon solve it again.As Meilyn became quiet, Simon\u2019s attention shifted back to the textbook.Introduction to Summoning had so much interesting content every time he read it. His heart pounded as he glanced at the new undead and dark magics to be dealt with in the future.\u2018I wanna try making a golem as soon as possible. Would it be possible to learn it by myself if I buy the materials at Rochester?\u2019\u201cSimon Polentia.\u201dSimon got startled and looked back at the voice that suddenly pierced through his ear.\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201dAaron was looking down at Simon with a ferocious gaze.Simon\u2019s face turned white.\u2018I got caught doing something else!\u2019There was no room for excuses since he was on a completely different page to the other students.\u201cAnswer me.\u201dAaron asked in a cold voice. He looked really angry, so Simon decided to be honest.\u201cSince the restoration was successful, I was looking at the topic of the next class for a while.\u201dOf course, Aaron knew that too.After all, Simon was the only student in this class who succeeded in completing whole restoration in 10 seconds.But, contrary to that, Aaron\u2019s face gave a really menacing atmosphere.\u201cRemain in the lecture room after the class.\u201dAaron turned his back and left after saying those words. A deep fear entangled Simon\u2019s body.\u201cS-Simon\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re marked.\u201dMuttered Rick with a hardened face. Meilyn folded her arms while pouting her lips.\u201cI warned you, okay? About just loafing around like that.\u201dEven if she said so, she seemed worried, walking on eggshells when looking at Simon.Of course, Simon couldn\u2019t hear any of his friends\u2019 voices.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The Summoning class ended.It was time for him to eat dinner and return to the dorm to wrap up the day, but Simon had to remain in the lecture room.In front of Simon, who was worried about what would happen to him in the empty lecture room, Aaron approached with his hands in his pockets.\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe two left the lecture room. Simon sank his head to his chest and walked behind Aaron.\u2018\u2026\u2026I should\u2019ve just kept practicing restoration.\u2019Aaron didn\u2019t say anything.Simon could accept any kind of reproach, as he was clearly at fault, but Aaron was treating Simon as if he didn\u2019t exist. This silence was even more painful for Simon.The two passed the building and entered an empty park. A spacious space surrounded by trees, with no one around.\u201cThere is something I cannot stand.\u201dAaron took out an old cigar from his pocket and put it into his mouth. When he snapped his finger, a spark splattered and ignited the cigar\u2019s tip.Aaron\u2019s eyes turned serious after taking a sip of smoke.Simon felt himself shrinking even more and lowered his head.\u201cStudents who have the will, but who are not learning in my class.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cTake out your skeleton.\u201dWhat did that mean? Simon was confused, but he took out the skeleton from the subspace as instructed.\u201cTry restoring it in front of me.\u201dWhen Aaron snapped the opposite hand of the hand holding the cigar, the skeleton flew away with a popping sound.Simon felt a headache and staggered as the connection was cut off, but he reflexively stretched out his right arm.\u2018Restoration!\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay. I got that you\u2019re unrivaled in the field of restoration. Then I\u2019ll teach you the advanced techniques of restoration.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cW-Weren\u2019t you planning to scold me?\u201d\u201cThis is an extra lesson.\u201dSaid Aaron while taking the cigar out of his mouth and holding it in his fingers.\u201cI\u2019m saying this just in case you perceive it wrong, but it\u2019s also the professor\u2019s job to provide additional classes to students who have exceeded the level of regular classes.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes were filled with tears from being touched so deeply.\u201c\u2026\u2026Professor Aaron!\u201d\u201cHurry up and take your stance. Don\u2019t waste my time even more.\u201cAh, yes!\u201dSimon raised his concentration with a lit-up face, and Aaron took out a skeleton from his subspace.\u2018Woah.\u2019It was a skeleton that looked much bigger and more sophisticated than Simon\u2019s.The bones were black and were more numerous and exquisite. It couldn\u2019t be compared with the Island Rat Man. It had a red cape on its back and was carrying various weapons.\u201cIt\u2019s a skeleton made out of demon\u2019s bone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so cool!\u201dA fine sword, gorgeous armor, beautiful horses. Simon was always placid in front of any riches or wealth, but he felt a tremendous desire to possess that skeleton.\u201cI won\u2019t show you twice, so watch carefully.\u201dAaron snapped his fingers and broke the skeleton. Then, he raised his arm and pointed to a nearby tree.Shake shake!The bones scattered randomly on the floor shook and flew into the air.Stab stab stab stab stab!Hundreds of bones pierced the tree like a skewer.\u201cAn offensive skill using restoration. Bone Piercing.\u201dYou could see a squirrel gnawing on the fruit nearby and running away in surprise. Aaron swung his thin arms and pointed at the squirrel.Wooooosh!Bones that flew like beams of light tightly shut around the squirrel.\u201cA binding skill using restoration. Bone Prison.\u201dThe prison flew upward and scattered when Aaron raised his index finger up. The squirrel ran away in the meantime.\u201cLastly.\u201dAaron clenched his fist. This time, the skeleton bones scattering in the sky flew towards Aaron\u2019s body.Click!Clack!Aaron\u2019s body started to be covered with bones. It was as if he was changing into a suit made of bones.The empty fittings started to piece together, jet-black flowed out of the empty space between the bones, filling it up like a fiber, and a red cape was placed on its back. Finally, the skull of the skeleton covered Aaron\u2019s head like a helmet.\u201cA defensive skill using restoration. Bone Armor.\u201d\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201dA shiver ran down Simon\u2019s spine. Aaron\u2019s appearance when wearing a skeleton was truly dazzling.\u2018It\u2019s so cool!\u2019Aaron stretched out his right arm. Then, his armor was taken off like a living garment, and it returned to the form of a skeleton down on one knee.\u201cA skeleton can be a weapon, a prison, or an armor depending on the Necromancer\u2019s capabilities. These are all dark magics that apply restoration. Did you understand?\u201dSimon nodded his head frantically.\u201cOf course, these restoration techniques can be learned in 2nd year\u2026\u2026 But you\u2019re excellent in learning restoration. I\u2019ll arrange it a little and teach you how to use it.\u201d\u201cTh-Thank you!\u201d\u201cFor now, the only technique you could at least imitate would be bone piercing. Get ready.\u201dAaron once again made Simon perform restoration and analyzed it.\u201cSo you start the restoration by putting the skull as the center.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCorrect that habit from this moment on. The key is to induce the skeleton to go in the desired direction. I\u2019ll give you a tip.\u201dSimon could understand Aaron\u2019s explanation immediately, as he had the experience of training his determination with the help of Pier.\u2018Gather in front of me!\u2019After several trials and errors, the scattered skeleton bones gathered in front of Simon. Of course, the speed of the subsequent bones were determined by the speed at which the skull, the core of the skeleton arrived, but for now, it was a great result just to be able to perform a restoration from a distance.\u201cRestoration and bone piercing are completely different skills. Think of it as an application of the power of restoration, but a completely different skill.\u201d\u201cDevelop a habit of tilting your bones to the side when you\u2019re calling it with restoration. That way, the sharp part will pierce the enemy\u2019s flesh.\u201d\u201cIf you focus the-jet black that stays on your bone in one direction, you can turn it like a sharp knife. For the bones without a proper place to stab, you can just place the bones on the target\u2019s body with a feeling of attaching it onto them. That alone has a significant binding effect on the opponent.\u201dSimon absorbed Aaron\u2019s teachings like a sponge. Then, he went straight to the actual training.Thump thump thump thump!Skeleton bones were attached to the nearby bamboo. The sharp edges of the bones pierced through the wood, and the other bones stuck like magnets.\u2018Restoration!\u2019As Simon clenched his fist in that state, the bones compressed the bamboo more and more.And finally,Clench!He succeeded in breaking the bamboo.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSimon clenched his fists tightly and shouted delightfully.He was able to learn a new skill in only a few hours.\u2018Ahhh, I\u2019m so happy!\u2019A huge sense of accomplishment made his whole body tremble.It was indeed an addictive sensation, like a drug.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Keep training so you could use it in actual fights.\u201d\u201cThank you, Professor!\u201dSimon, soaked in happiness, quickly bowed his head.Aaron said while shaking off the cigar in his fingers,\u201cI heard that Professor Jane added Cyclops Hunting as a performance assessment?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cAre you the participant?\u201dSimon shook his head.\u201cA student named Meilyn from the same group is our participating member.\u201d\u201cWise move.\u201dAaron spoke after taking a puff of the cigar.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to focus on the support of a team member. You\u2019ll see a lot of things to learn.\u201cYes sir!\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201dAaron turned his back, throwing his burnt cigars into a nearby trash bin.\u201cThis is just an extra lesson, nothing more, nothing less.\u201dAaron left after saying those words. Simon bowed his head once more.* * *After Aaron\u2019s lesson, Simon arrived at the lab where he was supposed to meet with his group mates.From the looks of it, they had already begun. The contents of the cauldron were boiling.The three of them, each sitting around the cauldron, saw Simon and stood up simultaneously.\u201cSimon!\u201d\u201cHow did it go?\u201dEveryone approached hurriedly. Simon answered with a smile.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any big d\u2014\u201d\u201cDid he hit you? Did he? I knew it\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cGiving you a punishment when we\u2019re still on our student protection period. That\u2019s so mean!\u201d\u201cKizen\u2019s punishment is known to be brutal. Like they tie the students in chains, take off their shirts, and with a long whip\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon started sweating.\u2018What in the world were they talking about?\u2019\u201cHe just gave me an extra lesson.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe gaze of the three of them gathered in the middle.\u201cThat Professor Aaron gave you a private lesson? No way!\u201dMeilyn denied it.\u201cMaybe he was hit hard in the head with a whip.\u201dRick placed his hand on his chin.\u201cSimon, are you really okay?\u201dCamibarez clasped her hands with tearful eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSince even trying to explain it felt like talking to a wall, Simon just walked past the three of them and went near the cauldron.\u201cHow\u2019s the potion going?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s perfect! Who do you think made it?\u201dMeilyn, who instantly returned to her usual confident face, wagged her finger.\u201cThe amount of water, the measurement of ingredients, the boiling time, and the skimming off of impure substances is perfect! Now, all we have to do is boil it down for another 20 minutes on low heat, and it\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cGreat work.\u201d\u201cHmph! Do you guys get it now? You just have to trust and follow me!\u201dRick sat down and tapped his legs.\u201cAgh. My legs are stiff after standing in this \u2018posture\u2019. Guess I gotta \u2018touch\u2019 my legs a little.\u201d\u201cHey!!\u201dWhile Meilyn and Rick were having a back and forth, shouting at each other, Simon and Camibarez had a conversation about potions in peace.Meilyn, who pushed Rick with the edge of the textbook, looked at the two with a strange look on her face.\u201cHmm. You guys look kinda closer now, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dSimon shrugged it off lightly, but Camibarez\u2019s ears were burning red.\u201cTell me honestly. Aside from being chased by the Keepers, did something happen between you guys on that night?\u201dRick, who had been knocked to the floor, lifted his head.\u201cIt takes one to know one after al\u2014 Ugh!\u201dMeilyn threw the textbook as if expecting it. Rick groaned and rolled around the floor.\u201cAfter all, all commoners are vulgar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026H-Having that kind of prejudice isn\u2019t good, Meilyn.\u201dMeilyn turned her head again to look at the two.\u201cSo, you won\u2019t tell me?\u201dCamibarez tried to read Simon\u2019s face, and Simon answered in a complete poker face,\u201cNothing happened, really. It just took us a long time because we got lost in the woods.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dMeilyn sighed as she saw the bandages all over the bodies of Simon and Camibarez.\u201cFine.\u201dThankfully, Meilyn moved on without asking any further questions. Then, Rick came with empty bottles.\u201cThe potion is ready. Let\u2019s bottle it up!\u201dRick titled the cauldron by holding the handle attached to it, carefully putting it near the bottle, and filling it with the liquid. Everyone watched him in silence.\u201cI hope it\u2019s effective with how everyone worked so hard to make it!\u201dSaid Camibarez. Rick handed a fully filled bottle to Meilyn.\u201cYou\u2019re curious if it\u2019s effective? Well then, we\u2019ll take a moment for our group leader to sample the potion as the representative!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You keep fooling around like that, I\u2019ll actually beat you to death, okay?\u201dWhen Meilyn started glaring at him, Rick quickly bowed his head and resumed his job.\u201cUgh. If only we weren\u2019t in Kizen, I\u2019d have you arrested for contempt of nobles.\u201d\u201cContempt? I\u2019m uneducated, so I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cStop fighting, the two of you!\u201dWhile talking about this and that, five bottles were filled with the potion.Meilyn decided to keep three, and left the remaining two bottles with Simon, in his subspace.\u201cWith this, we have something to present in our next Beginner Dark Magic class.\u201d\u201cWhile we\u2019re here, let\u2019s decide on how to answer Professor Jane tomorrow!\u201d\u201cSure thing!\u201dThe four of them cleaned up their surroundings and immediately left in search of an empty lecture room.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Life in Kizen was hectic, to the point where the Priest incident was utterly forgotten in Simon\u2019s mind for a while. In their second Beginner Dark Magic class, each group was given time to present their strategy to Jane.\u201cOne main attacker, one summoner, and two cursers.\u201dJane, who was examining the document of Group 7, raised her head. Simon and his group mates stood in front of her with nervous faces.\u201cAll of the members have different majors, but I see that the roles aren\u2019t that diverse.\u201dHere it comes.Meilyn put her hand on her chest and spoke in a confident voice.\u201cOf course, it would be great if the roles of the group members were clearly divided, but we decided to go with this because we thought that hunting the Cyclops quickly and efficiently was the top priority.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that this positioning is the best?\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s right.\u201dJane turned her head.\u201cWhat do you think, Simon Polentia?\u201d\u2018Urk.\u2019Coming in all of a sudden, huh?Simon got lost in thought with a nervous face. He has a rough idea of what kind of answer Jane wanted. However,\u201cWe\u2019re aware that our group lacks creativity in the combination of dark magics.\u201dAfter all, it was the student protection period. This presentation was a time to correct students\u2019 strategies, not to grade them.Then, it was more important to maintain the current teamwork and mood than to be swayed by the professor\u2019s opinion.\u201cI think there\u2019s nothing more important than safety. We\u2019ll hunt Cyclops more stably than any other group, and we\u2019ll make up for the deductions in creativity by scoring high with our own strengths.\u201dMeilyn, who shouted \u2018nice\u2019 inwardly, clenched her fist. Jane grinned and nodded her head.\u201cSure, if you put it that way.\u201dHer gaze shifted.\u201cCamibarez Ursula.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dCamibarez answered with a tense face.\u201cI\u2019d like to hear your opinion on this situation where a Hemomancy aspirant, who should be the core of the attack, is yielding the participation to a Curses aspirant and taking the role of curse support instead.\u201d\u2026\u2026This one\u2019s tough.Simon thought that the question might be too tough for a timid person like Camibarez to handle.When Simon glanced at her, her eyes were shaking, as expected.\u2018Cami, you really need to answer well on this one.\u2019If she answered in a way that suggested she yielded her participation because Meilyn was better, then she\u2019d be disqualified as a student of Kizen.Even if it was the truth, it should never be said in front of Jane.At that moment, Camibarez\u2019s eyes glanced towards Simon. Her eager eyes seemed to be asking, \u2018What should I do?\u2019.He couldn\u2019t answer her while the professor was in front of her.There was no time to give her the answer either.But this much would be fine.Simon gave her a word with the shape of his mouth.\u2018Cyclops.\u2019Then her eyes widened. She soon turned his gaze back to Jane.\u201cI-It\u2019s because of the special nature of the monster called Cyclops that we\u2019re going to deal with!\u201d\u2018Good!\u2019This time, Simon clenched his fist.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cTh-The tough and hard leather of Cyclops is difficult to attack with Hemomancy. We made this decision because we thought that Meilyn\u2019s Dark Flare, which can burn a monster alive, would be more suitable for hunting a Cyclops!\u201dThe expressions of Meilyn and Rick, who were watching anxiously, also lit up.\u201cIs that so?\u201dJane rested her chin on her hands and gave a strange smile.\u201cThen, if a monster other than Cyclops becomes your group\u2019s target?\u201d\u201cTh-Th-Then\u2026\u2026!\u201dHer hands trembled with nervousness.Camibarez had a timid personality, but she had to win the fight on her own in times like this. She shouted, closing her eyes tight.\u201cThen, at that time, I\u2019ll become the main attacker!\u201dHer voice was loud. It even cracked at the end.The assistant teachers around them blinked their eyes in surprise as the quiet girl shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll remember your statement.\u201dJane gave a smirk.She looked more satisfied with that than with Meilyn\u2019s or Simon\u2019s answers.In a way, it was the best result.\u2018Well done, Cami!\u2019She couldn\u2019t stand the embarrassment and covered her face with her hands. Simon thought that she was a girl that couldn\u2019t be hated.\u201cLastly, Rick Hayward.\u201dRick, standing at the end, answered vigorously with Jane\u2019s call.\u201cYes, Professor!\u201dRick stiffened up.Last night, he prepared three hundred possible question patterns and answers to them. He was confident that he could answer anything, no matter what was asked\u2026\u2026\u201cStop chit-chatting with your seatmate during lectures.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201dShe tapped the pile of papers and handed it to the assistant.\u201cI believe there\u2019s no need to ask questions that overlap with Camibarez\u2019. Well done, Group 7. Group 8, please come forward.\u201dThe nerve-wracking presentation time was over in an instant.Group 7 followed the assistant teacher\u2019s guidance and left the lecture room.Only the group that would soon present was stuck to a schedule, and the groups who had finished their presentations had free time afterward. It was indeed a Kizen-like freedom.And,\u201cOh my. Simon? You\u2019re seated next to me?\u201dMeilyn gave a signal with a wink, and Simon nodded. Soon, both of them said at the same time,\u201cStop chit-chatting with your seatmate!\u201d\u201cKyahahahahah!\u201dMeilyn, who after a long time, found Rick\u2019s weakness, diligently gave back what she had suffered in the past as revenge. Rick said with a sour face,\u201cHey, you think that\u2019s funny? It\u2019s not even that funny.\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s extremely funny! Ohohoho!\u201dSimon smiled as he looked at the two of them arguing.In fact, he knew that Meilyn\u2019s teasing and Rick\u2019s taking blame was to take care of Camibarez\u2019s feelings.Because Camibarez was still burying her face in her hands, as if she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the mistake she made in front of Jane.\u201cCami.\u201dSimon silently talked to her.\u201cSmoked chicken or steak for lunch. Which one would you like?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dShe gently lowered her hands and revealed her face.\u201cI-I\u2026\u2026 want chicken, since it\u2019s been a while\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cChicken! Our lunch today is chicken!\u201dShouted Rick, and he took the lead. The four of them headed to the restaurant, laughing and chatting with a friendly atmosphere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The building where his next class would be held was quite far, so he could be late if he wasted more time.\u2018Mm. Should I come back tomorrow?\u2019As he was wandering in front of the lecture room nervously, someone was walking past him.It was a pretty female student with a pink ribbon in her hair who was holding a textbook in her arms.\u201cHey. Sorry, but excuse me.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe female student blinked her eyes and stopped walking.\u201cThere\u2019s a girl named Lorain in Class L, right?\u201d\u201cYep yep. That\u2019s right. Lorain is in our class. Why?\u201dSimon carefully took an envelope out of his pocket.\u201cI wanted you to hand this to Lorain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201dThe female student stopped with her mouth wide open, as if someone pressed pause.And then,\u201cKyaaaaaaaah!\u201dShe suddenly screamed.\u2018Why the hell is she screaming?!\u2019Simon got startled and looked around. Luckily, they didn\u2019t attract much attention as there weren\u2019t many people around.\u201cRight, I remembered!\u201dLooking excitedly, she stood up on tiptoe and examined Simon\u2019s face thoroughly.\u201cYou\u2019re the Special Admission No.1 who took an oath as a freshman representative, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRight? Right? Kyaaaah! Oh my goodness! You guys are elites after all. Birds of a feather flock together!\u201dShe took the letter like she was snatching it from Simon\u2019s hand.\u201cMhm, mhm! I got it! I\u2019ll make sure to deliver this to Lorain if it kills me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You don\u2019t really have to go that far, you see.\u201dShe let out a naughty smile.\u201cThis is a very obvious question, but I shouldn\u2019t tell Lorain who you are, should I?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cOh, really? Can I tell her?\u201dHer eyes twinkled to the point of making Simon uncomfortable. He suddenly felt a shuddering sense of danger.\u201cN-Nah. Never mind about that. Just deliver the letter without saying anything else, please!\u201d\u201cHohoho! Alright! I thought you\u2019re quite daring, but I guess you\u2019re shy after all?\u201dShe slapped Simon\u2019s forearm and laughed like an elegant lady.Her reaction was like she was having so much fun with the topic right now.\u201c\u2026\u2026Say you.\u201dSimon squinted his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re not misunderstanding in a strange way, right?\u201d\u201cYes! Yes! Of course not!\u201dWhy the hell are you winking with that answer?This messenger had all of a sudden become unreliable, but Simon didn\u2019t have much time left before his class. He could barely make it if he sprinted the whole way.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well then, I\u2019m counting on you with that letter.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me!\u201dAs soon as Simon turned his back with an anxious mind, the female student ran into the classroom with tremendous speed.\u201cKyaaaaaaah! Guys! Guys! Guess what I got from outside?\u201dSimon sighed while pressing his hand into his forehead.* * *After finishing all the class for the day, Simon visited the campus cafe by himself.\u2018This is my first time here.\u2019As he grabbed the doorknob of the cafe and opened it, he heard a rattling bell. There were so many people when he entered, causing his eyes to widen in surprise.Students, seated at tables big and small, were chit-chatting noisily.The students seated by the wall were completely engrossed in studying. They were flipping through textbooks with one hand and taking notes with the other hand while drinking coffee with the straw in their mouth.It was also surprising to see them keep their concentration when people were roaming around like that.\u2018\u2026\u2026That\u2019s amazing. And they say that this place is more flooded during exam period, huh?\u2019It was at that moment that Simon, who sat down after searching for an empty seat, looked around.Clamor.The surroundings suddenly got noisy.A female student with her black hair hanging down was coming from the door where Simon had just entered.\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cRight, right?\u201dShe had a different atmosphere from the other students.An aloof gait, red eyes that seem to transcend the world, and a cold, expressionless face.She had an aura that made it hard to talk to her, to the point where it was hard to think she was actually a student like the others.Lorain Archbold.The only daughter of Nefthis, the Witch of Death who ruled over half the world for 300 years.With the appearance of a big name, people started crowding to see her. Lorain let out a small sigh and raised her brows.\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201dWith those words, the students within the tens of meters disappeared cleanly. The students sitting in the distance couldn\u2019t even make eye contact and bowed their heads.After creating a miracle of turning the surroundings cold in an instant, she started moving.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd the place where her steps stopped was in front of Simon.Simon gulped. All of a sudden, an extreme nervousness had rushed over him.\u2018Wh-Why does she feel so unfamiliar?\u2019He thought they became close after eating and shopping together. It was difficult to deal with her in a Kizen school uniform when he hadn\u2019t seen her in a long time.\u201cI-It\u2019s been a while. Haha\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe mustered up the courage to talk to her, But Lorain was still cold and expressionless.While Simon, who was bewildered, thought about if he did something wrong, Lorain\u2019s eyes slowly curved into half-moons, and the corners of her lips became arcs.\u201cHey Simon.\u201dIt was the smile that Simon knew well.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The two took the coffee they ordered and went up to the third floor of the cafe.The owner of the cafe, who seemed very nervous, took the order by themselves, and when Lorain said that she wanted a quiet place, they immediately opened the closed 3rd floor.Thanks to this, the two could sit in a spacious outdoor window seat. A cool breeze blew, and it felt great.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen each other since Langerstine.\u201dLorain, sitting opposite Simon, stroked down her night-sky-like hair. Simon, still nervous, nodded his head with a stiff smile.\u201cY-You surprisingly look good with your uniform.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dShe looked down at her school uniform once and then stared at Simon with a sullen face.\u201cHey, what are you trying to say? Are you telling me that I look old or something?\u201dSimon, whose face turned red, immediately waved his hand dismissively.\u2018How come she\u2019s interpreting it like that?\u2019\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026! It\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t imagine how you would look with the uniform when we met at Langerstine\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you imagine? Is it because I look old?\u201d\u2018I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that!\u2019From Simon\u2019s point of view, Lorain\u2019s force that drove the gangs away when they first met was really more than a professional Necromancer.He only felt a strange sensation because such a girl was now sitting in front of him wearing the same uniform.\u2018But why is it so hard to explain this in words?\u2019Simon sighed inwardly.\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201dShe drank her coffee with a straw and winked. Realizing that he was being played with, Simon let out a bitter laugh.\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dAs she narrowed her eyes, Lorain slowly crossed her legs and said,\u201cWhy did you ask to meet me?\u201dThe atmosphere changed.This was it. The atmosphere of a hard-to-approach older person.Simon also instinctively felt that it was about time to get to the point.After checking once again that no one was around, he opened his mouth with a serious tone.\u201c\u2026\u2026There\u2019s a traitor inside Kizen.\u201dSimon calmly told her the story of how he got lost in the Forbidden Forest after being chased by the Keepers, and of him seeing a priest laying a cross and praying.Of course, he removed the part where they escaped with the help of Pier. He said that he was in a crisis, but they survived thanks to Keepers appearing at the right time.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the story, Lorain got lost in thought with a serious face.\u201cLorain. It may be hard to believe, but I\u2014\u201d\u201cI believe you.\u201dShe raised her head.\u201cOther than that, could you describe the appearance of the cross you saw in detail?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh, hmm. As far as I remember, a woman was carved on the largest cross in the center. A naked woman surrounded by vines or something?\u201d\u201cThat narrows it down.\u201dLorain\u2019s red eyes gleamed.\u201cThat\u2019s Goddess Deva, the only god the priests of Efnel believe in.\u201dThe Divine College \u2018Efnel\u2019, under the direct control of the Pope.As the antithesis of Kizen, which trained Necromancers. This was where Priests were trained.Within the Holy Federation, it was an institution that had around the same level of recognition and power as Kizen. The \u2018Saintess\u2019, who was considered the most powerful, monopolizes all the power, to the extent where they are only selected among the female students of Efnel.Kizen and Efnel.Efnel and Kizen.Which one was stronger? Which students were better?These questions had long been a topic of discussion among the people of the continent.\u201c\u2026\u2026How dare.\u201dCrack!The coffee leaked out as Lorain shattered the glass cup she was holding with her grip.\u201cHow dare a damned priest get into Kizen like this!\u201dShe looked genuinely angry. Simon couldn\u2019t help but be nervous, even though he knew that the murderous spirit flowing from her body wasn\u2019t aimed at him.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWho knows about this other than you?\u201d\u201cCamibarez, who went to the forest with me. It\u2019s just the two of us.\u201dShe nodded her head.\u201cThank you for telling me. I\u2019ll report it to my mom right away.\u201dSimon had a reason for keeping this a secret.The professors at Kizen were also the suspects in this case. Only Nefthis should know, so that investigations from various directions could be made.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Simon!\u201dLorain got up from her seat.\u201cWh-Where to?\u201d\u201cTo the Forbidden Forest. There may be some clues left at the scene where you saw the Priest.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u2026\u2026Right now?\u201d* * *Clip clop clip clop!Late in the evening, Simon rode a skeleton horse for the first time in his life.It\u2019s said that one skeleton horse was the price of one house, but it being so expensive was understandable. Skeleton horses were obviously faster than horses\u2014they didn\u2019t tire\u2014and the ride was comfortable.\u201cYou\u2019re better at this than I thought. Did you take riding lessons?\u201dAsked Lorain, who was riding a skeleton horse to his side.\u201cA little bit, back in my hometown.\u201dIn fact, regardless of riding skills, Simon and the skeleton horse got along very well.Above all, the skeleton horse was keeping up with Simon well. As soon as Simon held out his hand, the skeleton horse gently rubbed his face, acting cute.\u201cThis way, Lorain.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe could navigate easily since it was a road he had been through once. Using the skeleton horse, he jumped over the valley he had crossed with Camibarez and entered the depths of the forest.\u201cAround this place.\u201d\u201cThanks for the guide. Let\u2019s walk in from here.\u201dThe two jumped off the skeleton horses. When Lorain opened the subspace in the air, the skeleton horses ran into it and disappeared.Simon smacked his lips.\u2018I wanted to ride a little bit more.\u2019He had two items on his bucket list that he wanted to accomplish when he soon made money. The first was a skeleton made of demon bones, and the second was a skeleton horse.Now, the two of them walked sneakily through the Forbidden Forest. Simon thought he could see the forest road much better than when he first came with Camibarez.They got to the place where he encountered the Priest without wandering long.\u201cIs this the place?\u201cYeah, I\u2019m certain.\u201dThe two began to search around with serious faces.\u2018\u2026\u2026The traces are gone.\u2019He was confident that this was the place where he saw the Priest. However, the altar, the decorations, the cross, and even the battle scars in the ground, where it was turned over during the battle between Pier and Priest, were completely gone.It was as if nothing had happened.Simon felt like he was possessed by a ghost.\u201cHow is it going, Lorain?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was kneeling on the ground and running her palms down the grass. Soon, she shook her head.\u201cOddly enough, there are no traces at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Mmm.\u201d\u201cBut they certainly erased the traces.\u201dShe stood up and folded her arms.\u201cSimon, judging from your story, they\u2019re quite skilled. The combat power and also that they were able to hide the traces of a wide area. The most shocking thing is that they entered Kizen with a core in their body while serving God. After all, they think that core is the power that denies God.\u201d\u201cBut if you open the core, you can\u2019t use the priest\u2019s Divinity, right?\u201dLorain nodded her head.\u201cI don\u2019t know how it works either, but according to their logic, jet-black is the power of a cursed demon, and divinity is a power that comes from the belief in God. Whatever it is, the two powers do indeed conflict with each other.\u201dShe turned her back.\u201cThe situation is serious. Let\u2019s go back to Kizen. I think I need to go see my mom. Now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We don\u2019t know when and where that Priest would try to take your life. Maybe it would be better for you to take a break from class for a wh\u2014\u201d\u201cNah.\u201dSimon shook his head.\u201cI\u2019ll just act like normal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Wouldn\u2019t it be too dangerous?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. That person may not have seen my face, and even if they were after me, they would somehow leave a clue.\u201dLorain\u2019s red eyes flashed for a while.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I don\u2019t need a clue made by risking your life.\u201d\u201cJust listen to me, Lorain. If I take a break from class or show odd behavior that I didn\u2019t make before, the Priest will be certain of my identity. What would they think if they saw Kizen\u2019s security roaming around me? They\u2019ll find out that I\u2019ve given the information to the higher-ups, and they\u2019ll realize that they\u2019re cornered.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2014!\u201d\u201cCan you predict what a fanatic will do if they get cornered?\u201dLorain bit her lip.The opponent was so loyal that they entered Kizen with a core considered a terrible sin in their body to carry out their mission. The behavior of fanatics couldn\u2019t be understood by an average person.Large-scale hostage-taking and suicide terrorisms were incidents commonly caused by the fanatics.If the same thing happened in Kizen, the organization\u2019s external image would be seriously damaged, and it\u2019d provide a reason for those who have questioned Kizen\u2019s governing system to unite.After giving it a thought, Lorain spoke while sighing.\u201c\u2026\u2026Fine. But if there\u2019s anything fishy going on, I\u2019ll protect you, even if it limits your freedom. Remember that there\u2019s no need to sacrifice yourself for everyone\u2019s well-being.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dOf course, Simon didn\u2019t think of it as a sacrifice at all.\u2018I can\u2019t stop my school life just because of that.\u2019If you failed to attend class, the gap between you and other students would widen.Then, what if the time came when you had to leave Kizen due to lack of grades or skill?Kizen was never a flexible institution to take care of an individual\u2019s circumstances, and it was your loss if you sat on your hands.It was Simon\u2019s judgment that it\u2019d be better to boldly keep the school life if he had to bear the risk one way or another. There was still a lot to learn at the school.The two of them parted after arriving in Kizen, and Simon returned to the dormitory as if nothing had happened.* * *The next morning.Class A students were waiting to enter the building with excited faces.\u201cIt\u2019s finally today!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dToday was Jane\u2019s Beginner Dark Magic class.Within it was the long-awaited Cyclops simulation scheduled for today. Everyone was wearing special training uniforms, not school uniforms.\u201cAs expected from Professor Jane.\u201dSaid Rick while rubbing his nose.\u201cI heard that, originally, you barely get to try the simulation in the 2nd semester, and we\u2019re here trying it before the protection period ends.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026 I struggled to fall asleep yesterday.\u201dMuttered Camibarez. Meilyn laughed.\u201cCome on, it\u2019s just a simulation battle, you see?\u201d\u201cNow, now. Everyone in Class A, please get into your groups!\u201dJane\u2019s assistant teachers took control of the students. The students lined up and entered the building.The hallways were clean. It looked like a new building. Everyone was talking in anticipation of the Simulation, but for Simon, every time he took a step, he felt his hair stand on end with a strange sensation.\u201cGroups 1 to 8, over here.\u201d\u201cGroups 9 to 16, this way.\u201dThen, when they went down via magic circle elevator, an open space stretched out.\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201dKizen\u2019s virtual battle simulation system, \u2018Avalon\u2019.The system couldn\u2019t be found anywhere else in the whole continent. Any monster could be reproduced as a magical creature to perform a virtual battle.It was the result of moving the ancient ruins of \u2018Hallucina\u2019, a fortress of illusions and hallucinations, to Kizen and modifying it repeatedly.\u201cGood to see you, Class A.\u201dJane and her assistants came down from the magic circle elevator on the opposite side. The students bowed their heads in unison.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, so I\u2019ll get straight to the explanation.\u201dIt progressed neatly, as expected from her.As Jane pressed the button of the control device in her hand, the magic projector on the ceiling activated, and a screen appeared.\u201cGroups 1 to 4 will take the simulation on the left, and Groups 5 to 8 will take the one on the right. All rules are exactly the same as performance assessment. One participant and three supporters. Support team members can\u2019t move from the set position, and only the participant can use direct offensive attacks. The Cyclops will only recognize the participant as an enemy and attack them.\u201dJane reached out her hand and tapped the vest that her assistant was holding.\u201cBut there\u2019s no need to worry too much. The attacks of the virtual Cyclops are absorbed by this vest\u2019s barrier magic. Each time damage is absorbed, the barrier gauge on the screen shown above will go down. Training ends when the gauge reaches 0. Return to the waiting room.\u201dThe students nodded with nervous faces.\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to experience up to 3 sets of virtual battles. I hope that it\u2019ll be a valuable time to evaluate how well the strategy you made last time fits and to raise the practical application to the maximum.\u201dAfter Jane\u2019s explanation, the simulation immediately began. Groups 1 and 5 entered the training room, and the rest were guided to the waiting room.The waiting room was a resting place with spacious sofas all over the place and a refreshment area. There was a mana projector installed on the ceiling, and with this screen, you could check on the situation of the other groups.Simon and his party decided to watch the tests of the other groups first before working on their own strategy.\u2018Ah, so Cindi Vivace is participating.\u2019Group 5 was the group of Necromancy aspirant Cindy Vivace, the purse snatcher he met in Langerstine.She was the participating member, and her group was composed of aspirants of Curses, the Mechanics of Jet-Black, and Poisonous Alchemy.The balance wasn\u2019t so bad, in Simon\u2019s opinion.[Then, we will now begin the simulation battle.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Jane\u2019s voice was heard from the loudspeaker.Woooooooooosh!The whole area seemed to fill with mana, and the training room suddenly turned into a forest.The surroundings were filled with trees, as if you\u2019d fallen into the middle of the forest. Birds chirped and even winds blew. Exclamations broke loose from the students who were watching.Thump! Thump! Thump!Ringing footsteps were heard in the distance and the birds flew away.The sound of footsteps got closer and closer, and soon after passing through the bushes, a massive turquoise monster with a height surpassing 2 meters appeared.Its body was lined with muscles. One eye was contorted like it was squashed, and the other eye was moving up and down frantically.[Kwooooouuuuugh!]As he roared with his mouth wide open, the faces of the students who entered the training room hardened simultaneously.\u201cAlright!\u201dCindy reached her arms behind her back. A sleek black scythe was summoned in her hands.\u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201dThe battle began with a thunderous roar.And\u2026[Simulation failed]Time Spent: 1 minute and 16 secondsDamage Inflicted: 22%Barrier Gauge: 0%Overall Rating: FThe information measured from the simulation was projected on the screen of the mana projector.Everyone opened their mouths at the one-sided result. Simon was also surprised.\u2018It\u2019s no joke, huh?\u2019The groupmates ran towards Cindy, who was lying down on the floor. After sitting up, she smiled awkwardly while scratching her head.\u201cSorry, my timing for ghosting was a bit off. I\u2019ll make sure to avoid it next time!\u201dGroup 1, who were beside them, finished faster than Group 5.They had the same reason. The participant couldn\u2019t correctly respond to the fierce attacks of the Cyclops and was knocked out. Just one shot was enough to drop the barrier gauge down to less than half.On that, both groups brought \u2018curses\u2019 as their means of sealing the Cyclops, but the participants were knocked out before they cast the curse, so there was no time to cast it.\u201cThe movements of the participants were all frozen.\u201dSaid Rick. Simon also nodded.\u201cThere must be some psychological factors too.\u201dEven if the three group members were standing behind them, the fear and tension from facing the Cyclops themselves wouldn\u2019t be easily overcome.Simon turned his head.\u201cMeilyn, will you really be alright?\u201cHuh? Hm?\u201dWith her face as white as a sheet of paper, she quickly nodded.\u201cI-I\u2019ll be alright, of course!\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem alright, judging from the nervousness and trembling in her voice.In the end, she left to go to the bathroom. Not only her, but many other students were going straight to the bathroom.Group 2 and Group 6\u2019s battle followed. Simon didn\u2019t even blink to see if he could get a hint, but this time too, the participants were knocked out after getting directly hit by the attack of the Cyclops.[Group 3 and Group 7. Please come into the training room.]Group 7\u2019s turn came much sooner than he expected. When Simon was getting up from his seat, a group of students was heading to the opposite training room too.\u2018Ah, so Group 3 was Hector\u2019s group.\u2019Group leader Hector acted as the center, with Class A\u2019s ace summoner, Pierre Berkeley, and the two others who were skilled, with over 90 points in the Mechanics of Jet-Black and Necromancy. In fact, they were the group that received the best evaluation in Class A.At that moment, Hector and Simon\u2019s eyes met. The corners of Hector\u2019s mouth rose up.\u201cObviously, you\u2019re the participant of Group 7, right?\u201dSimon shook his head.\u201cNot me. It\u2019s Meilyn.\u201d\u201cThat lady who doesn\u2019t understand the ways of the world as a participant, huh? Did you back off to boost her morale?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that the best person participated.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so boring, Simon Polentia.\u201dHector\u2019s eyes gleamed.\u201cGive it all you got. I\u2019ll make sure to break you properly this time.\u201d[Group 3, Group 7! Hurry up and get into the training room.]With the pushing voice of the assistant teacher, the two turned their backs and headed for their respective training rooms.Simon entered the training room. Rick and Camibarez were stretching while waiting. The assistant with the clipboard looked around and said,\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d\u201cSorry I\u2019m late!\u201dFinally, Meilyn came in while panting. As the assistant pressed the controller in their hand, the countless magic signals on the wall turned on, and the door closed.\u201cParticipating member, to the front.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMeilyn came forward with a hardened expression.\u201cI\u2019ll indicate the location of the support positions.\u201dThe light on the ceiling signal flickered, and circles of mana were drawn on the floor. The three of them walked to their respective set positions. Camibarez on the left, Simon in the center, and Rick on the right. And Meilyn stood in front of them.\u201cThe Cyclops can\u2019t see the supporting members, so rest assured. Of course, taking even one step outside of this circle will result in disqualification.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cParticipant, are you ready?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Yes!\u201dMeilyn, who had been spacing out for a moment, answered.\u201cMeilyn, get the hang of yourself. Are you really okay?\u201dAsked Rick.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, I said I\u2019m fine!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tense up too much, Meilyn! It\u2019s just a simulation battle after all! Cheer up!\u201d\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201dEveryone took their positions. The assistant stepped back and said,\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll commence the first simulation battle of the 7th group.The assistant teacher\u2019s body disappeared as if it had melted into the air, and a strong wind blew in. Simon\u2019s eyes shone sharply.\u2018To feel the wind indoors\u2026 It\u2019s not just a simple hallucination after all.\u2019As the floor turned green, the surrounding area turned into a forest and a swamp spread out.A leaf flew in the wind and hit Simon\u2019s forearm. When he touched it with his hand, he could feel the texture of the leaves as they were.Looking at it from the outside and experiencing it in person was definitely different. Simon couldn\u2019t think of anything else in front of the overwhelming sense of reality.And\u2026Thump! Thump!You could feel the floor vibrating. Rick shouted,\u201cEveryone get ready! It\u2019s coming!\u201dThump! Thump! Thump! Thump!With the loud echo of footsteps, a massive Cyclops rushed in and made its way through the thick leaves.[Gwooooooough!!]The hairs all over his body stood on end and his heart started beating rapidly. It really felt like he ran into a monster in the forest.\u2018You can feel this much pressure in the just set position. How much worse is it for Meilyn, who has to face it from the front\u2026\u2026?\u2019\u201cPheww.\u201dThen, he saw her taking a deep breath. Her expression changed to something more serious.\u201cAlright, just do what you always do.\u201dHer trembling subsided.Simon smiled. She quickly adjusted to the situation, unlike what he expected.\u2018Yeah. Who am I worried about? There\u2019s no need to worry about anyone here.\u201dSimon pulled down the imaginary lever.\u2018Let\u2019s just focus on my role 200%!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stepped back with a ghastly face.\u2018Come out.\u2019Simon pulled the imaginary lever. The subspace opened on the floor, and two skeletons came out.\u2018Forward!\u2019The skeletons ran forward at a frightening speed. Looking at this, the Cyclops lifted the log in his hands.Cyclopes were monsters that used tools, and their main means of attack was uprooting trees and wielding them like clubs.Whoooosh!With a horrifying air-shattering sound, a skeleton got smashed into pieces by the wooden club. At the same time, the skeleton that walked up from the side thrust its shortsword.Slaaaash!The sword passed by, but only a slight scratch was made on the skin.Enraged, the Cyclops twisted its back once more and swung its club.\u2018After all, it\u2019s better to use only one in this situation.\u2019Simon clenched his teeth and stretched out his arms. He concentrated all his focus only on one skeleton\u2019s thought.\u2018Duck!\u2019Simon\u2019s absolute command was imposed. The skeleton reacted immediately, lowering its waist to avoid the club, and ran to the side in a nimble movement.\u201cNice, Simon!\u201dRick\u2019s shout was heard.Simon was able to control two undead units at once, but he was the type that showed his true powers when he focused solely on one skeleton. The enraged Cyclops started swinging his club frantically.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!The skeleton dodged the attack as if playing jump rope. Jaws dropped from the three people behind him along with the students watching.Simon\u2019s role was originally to buy some time with the undead, but he was doing better than everyone expected.\u201cHurry up! I can\u2019t last long!\u201d\u201cOn it!\u201dRick and Camibarez prepared Exhaust and Meilyn prepared Dark Flare, a jet-black elemental spell.The three magic circles were being quickly completed.Slam!The skeleton that had barely been buying time eventually got shattered by the club.The Cyclops, fuming and scanning the surroundings with its scorching eyes, found Meilyn and jumped in.\u201cKugh!\u201dSimon took two additional skeletons out from the subspace and sent them forth. However, he hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the damage caused by the impact of the destruction of his summons, and the skeletons were penetrated by the Cyclops\u2019 chariot-like charge.\u201cIt\u2019s ready!\u201dShouted Rick. You could also see Camibarez raising her arms.\u201cExhaust!\u201d\u201cExhaust!\u201dThe two\u2019s magic circles flashed and activated at the same time.The curses hit the target accurately! The Cyclops\u2019 movement slowed down.\u201cIt worked!\u201dThe faces of Rick and Camibarez lit up, but Simon\u2019s face didn\u2019t get any better.\u2018It\u2019s still fast!\u2019The decrease in speed due to the curse was smaller than he thought. The Cyclops kept running, and Meilyn completed the blazing Black Flame on her right hand.The distance between the monster and Meilyn was three meters. She let out a powerful shout and swung her right hand. The dark flame flew away while pouring out smoke.Roooaaaar!The dark flame exploded and covered the Cyclops\u2019 body. That moment when everyone cheered and clenched their fists\u2026Swiish!Through the flames, a wildly swung club struck her head.Beep![Simulation failed]Time Spent: 2 minutes and 11 secondsDamage Inflicted: 26%Barrier Gauge: 0%Overall Rating: F\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe thick forest returned back to the training room as if the next page had been turned.Meilyn was knocked out on the floor after being hit by the Cyclops\u2019 club and flying several meters away.\u201cMeilyn!\u201d\u201cA-Are you alright?\u201dEveryone freaked out and ran towards her. Fortunately, she seemed fine. She lifted her front up with her hands on the floor while frowning.\u201cMeilyn! Meilyn! Are you really alright?\u201dCamibarez held Meilyn\u2019s hand with tears in her eyes. Meilyn forced a smile and said that nothing hurt.[Good work, Group 7.]Jane\u2019s voice was heard from the loudspeaker in the ceiling. Rick, startled, sprang to his feet. Simon and Camibarez supported Meilyn from both of her sides.[Group 7, you pulled off the initial plan to some extent. The performance of the Summoner who distracted the Cyclops with the skeleton was especially impressive.]\u201cThank you.\u201dSimon bowed his head.[However, the rest of the members were unsatisfactory overall. Blocking the movement with Exhaust and using Dark Flare to defeat the Cyclops in the meantime. It might sound plausible in theory, but you must\u2019ve realized that in practice it is a little different.]Everyone nodded with stiff faces.[The biggest problem is the lack of proficiency. Try to minimize missing when casting Dark Flare or Exhaust. That\u2019s all.]\u201cThank you!\u201dGroup 7 followed the assistant teacher\u2019s guide and ploddingly came out of the training room.And then\u2026\u201cWoooooaaaaaah!\u201dAs soon as they got into the waiting room, loud cheers broke loose.\u201c\u2026\u2026Th-That startled me.\u201dOf course, the cheers weren\u2019t directed toward Group 7.The training room of Group 3 right next to them\u2026You could see the Cyclops knocked out on the floor, bleeding, and Hector, proudly standing on top of it, letting out a deep breath.Black smoke was constantly flowing from the surrounding floor.[Simulation succeeded]Time Spent: 4 minutes and 2 secondsDamage Inflicted: 100%Barrier Gauge: 98%Overall Rating: A* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026Th-They managed to hunt that?\u201d\u201cThe barrier gauge is at 98%. It practically means he didn\u2019t receive a single hit, right?\u201dThe mood of Group 3, the only group that hunted the Cyclops in the first attempt, was at its peak. The group members approached Hector and gave a high-five.[Well done, Group 3.]The first compliment from the vice-president of Kizen, Jane.Students burst out in envy, and even that calm Hector smiled at this moment.After Jane\u2019s detailed comments, they finally came out of the training room.\u201cWoooaaah!\u201d\u201cNice, Hector!\u201dHector\u2019s faction echoed his name. Other students also clapped and congratulated them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, the eyes of Hector and Simon met. Hector raised his eyes to see the result of Group 7 and scoffed. He wore an expression as if telling Simon, \u2018Look at you.\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026\u201dSimon looked back at Meilyn\u2019s voice. Her eyes were blazing so hot sparks they were sparking\u201cDefinitely win.\u201dEveryone nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right! There\u2019s no time to be disappointed. We still have two games left!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take it slow and determine what the problem is.\u201dGroup 7 started an emergency strategy meeting.\u201cFirst of all, as Professor Jane pointed out, the biggest problem is our proficiency.\u201dSaid Rick.\u201cWhile Simon buys time with the skeleton, Cami and I need to activate Exhaust quickly without making any mistakes.\u201dSimon opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s that, but\u2026 Exhaust is a curse that grows stronger as it stacks. Even when the first curses from you two hit, the Cyclops didn\u2019t slow down that much.\u201dHaving said that, Simon turned his head and looked at Meilyn.\u201cMeilyn, you have to dodge.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think about whether an attack will come from behind, but watch the Cyclops\u2019 movements with the thought that an attack will definitely come at you. I\u2019ll also do my best to protect you.\u201dMeilyn nodded her head with a firm face. Simon stood up from his seat.\u201cYou know how to do that thing we learned in combat magic, right? That feeling of stepping on the jet-black.\u201d\u201cStepping on\u2026\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cStand up. I\u2019ll teach you again.\u201dSimon gave Meilyn some tips and tricks, and Rick and Camibarez discussed the Exhaust magic circles together.\u201cLet\u2019s take the persistence formula out.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t that lower the stability too much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s high-risk, high-reward. It\u2019s important to stack up the curses quickly. After all, if Meilyn gets hit even once, it\u2019s game over.\u201dThe cycle came back soon, and it was the turns of groups 3 and 7 again. Simon and his party entered the training room.\u201cNow, let\u2019s do our best!\u201d\u201cGo team!\u201dEveryone lifted the mood and cleared up the uneasy feeling.After a while, the surroundings changed to grass, and the Cyclops appeared with a roar. The nervous feeling toned down after experiencing it once.The battle began as the Cyclops found Meilyn and jumped in.\u2018Forward!\u2019Like they were waiting, Simon\u2019s skeleton also rushed in. This time too, it unfolded in a way where one skeleton was knocked out first and the other one was persistently holding back the Cyclops.\u2018Without a doubt, its movement is becoming familiar little by little.\u2019The Cyclops\u2019 attack pattern wasn\u2019t difficult. It had power and speed, but its movements were simple. You could tell whether it was a swing or a smash by just looking at the movements of its shoulder and arm muscles.However, no matter how great Simon\u2019s abilities were, there was a limit to avoiding all attacks with the stiff body of a skeleton. Eventually, the skeleton was shattered, and the Cyclops rushed to Meilyn.\u201cExhaust!\u201d\u201cExhaust!\u201dThis time again, the two curses successfully hit, and the movement of the Cyclops dulled. Meilyn also completed the Dark Flare.In general, they had more time than the first attempt.\u201cHup!\u201dShe took a deep breath and shot her black flames. The Cyclops paused and raised the club, but the fireball that exploded on the club spread out and stuck to its skin.\u2018Alright! It went in perfectly!\u2019Dark Flare was definitely an effective means of attack. You could see the health gauge of Cyclops displayed on the mana project rapidly decreasing.\u201cMeilyn! We\u2019re just getting started!\u201d\u201cI know that too!\u201dCyclops fixed its eye on Meilyn from the tremendous pain that burned its skin. Then, it started rushing toward her frantically.Simon sent out the skeletons, but the Cyclops was seeing red due to the pain, no longer paying any attention to the undead.Taking the attacks of the skeleton with its body, it rushed in to kill Meilyn, who caused this terrible pain.And at this moment, Meilyn was preparing for the second Dark Flare.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Meilyn canceled the spell and knelt down. The Cyclops\u2019 club soared into the sky and descended, slashing through the air.\u2018The feeling of\u2026\u2026 stepping on it!\u2019Poooooooooow!The club hit the floor. Meilyn, who had dodged it properly by raising the jet-black, roughly tumbled across the grass.\u201cThe next attack is coming! Dodge it!\u201dAs Meilyn hurriedly got up after hearing Simon\u2019s shout, a raging demon swung its club while fire embraced its whole body.Creak!The club grazed past Meilyn\u2019s leg. A sign that said, \u2018Right leg fractured,\u2019 appeared on the mana projector.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cMeilyn!\u201dMeilyn tried to run away again, but her legs felt weak.The training uniform she was wearing reproduced the symptoms of a broken leg.\u201cExhaust!\u201d\u201cExhaust!\u201dThe next Exhausts were fired. This time, the Cyclops\u2019 movement visibly slowed down, but Meilyn couldn\u2019t dodge its attack because of her injured leg.\u201cA-Ahh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe Cyclops\u2019 club, which was persistently chasing her, fell on her head as she was crawling and running away.[Simulation failed]Time Spent: 3 minutes and 45 secondsDamage Inflicted: 42%Barrier Gauge: 0%Overall Rating: E\u201cThat was close!\u201dAs the forest turned back into the room, Rick let out an exclamation.Simon also bit his lip and nodded. If it wasn\u2019t for the broken leg, it would\u2019ve been easier to defeat Cyclops seeing as its movements were slowed by the curses.After hearing Jane\u2019s comments and coming out of the training room, Hector\u2019s Group 3 successfully hunted the Cyclops this time too. They also manage to shorten the time by about 20 seconds.Camibarez muttered,\u201c\u2026\u2026Next one will be our last.\u201dRick and Meilyn nodded bitterly, their morale sinking.\u201cGather up for a sec.\u201dSaid Simon. Everyone turned to look at him.\u201cWe can definitely clear it on our next try.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes were burning like a fire, like he didn\u2019t even care about their previous defeat.No.\u201cI have a plan for guaranteed victory.\u201dHe looked like he was having so much fun with the difficulty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In particular, Meilyn, the participant, was standing as she seriously warmed up, and got ready.\u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u201dWith Rick\u2019s shout, the Cyclops appeared through the thick trees and roared. This time too, Simon\u2019s skeleton was the first to rush out.\u2018I\u2019ll hold it up no matter what!\u2019While Simon\u2019s skeletons attracted the attention of Cyclops, Meilyn prepared Dark Flare and Rick and Camibarez prepared their Exhausts.So far, it was the same as the previous battle.Crack!One skeleton couldn\u2019t withstand the Cyclops\u2019 combo and was shattered. Immediately, Simon ordered the command to attack by connecting to the thoughts of the skeleton standing behind the Cyclops.Slash!The Cyclops, with its back slashed, attacked the skeleton in a fiery rage.\u201cDark Flare is 80% complete!\u201dShouted Meilyn.\u201cMy first Exhaust is completed!\u201d\u201cMe too! I\u2019ll get to the next step right away!\u201dThey placed the finished Exhaust in their right hand and started casting a new one with their left.This is the main point of their new plan.The only time Simon\u2019s skeleton could hold the Cyclops was at the beginning, when the Cyclops recognized the skeleton as the only enemy, before Meilyn and other members started attacking it.By extending the first part of the fight, the possible benefits at the start were maximized.Even after completing the Dark Flare, Meilyn stood still and waited, and the remaining two were preparing for the second Exhaust.Since it was almost their first time doing multi-casting, both of them made many mistakes, but Simon held up miraculously well in controlling the undead enough to cover them.\u2018Seventh skeleton in. Go!\u2019Of course, Simon\u2019s role that sustained the early stage was the most important in this strategy.This was because the Cyclops would head straight to Meilyn if Simon\u2019s concentration faltered even a little.\u201cSimon! It\u2019s done!\u201dFinally, Rick and Camibarez completed the four Exhausts.Upon hearing that, Simon disassembled the skeleton without hesitation.Skeletons scattered on the floor, and the Cyclops, who had lost its opponent, looked around and found Meilyn.Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!The monster ran while ringing the floor. At the same time, it came within the range of the curse.\u201cExhaust!\u201d\u201cExhaust!\u201dThe magic circles of Rick and Camibarez lit up, and the curses hit the Cyclops\u2019 body.The Cyclops slowed down. Meilyn took this chance and threw the Dark Flare.The black flame began to burn its skin, and a terrifying smell of burning pierced through the nose.[Kyaaaaaaaaaaagh!]The Cyclops floundered and raised its club. Simon, who was observing this scene, shouted,\u201cAt the front, a smash!\u201dMeilyn stepped on the jet-black and jumped away. The club fell where she was and left a dent on the floor.\u201cBack off! It\u2019s going to fold its body as it is and proceed to uppercut!\u201dSwing!The Cyclops, who hit the floor, twisted flexibly and raised the club, but Meilyn avoided even that too.\u201cFrontal charge!\u201dSimon, who figured out the movements of the Cyclops, gave instructions, and Meilyn dodged accordingly.The opponent was affected by four stacks of Exhaust, so even Meilyn, who lacked the athletic ability, could avoid it. The Exhaust curse was very effective for monsters who moved a lot, such as Cyclopes.\u201cHere comes another one!\u201dRick and Camibarez added a pair of Exhausts.That was the sixth Exhaust in total!That violent Cyclops, who swung its club recklessly, looked like it was out of stamina for the first time.\u201cI\u2019ll use blood magic!\u201dCamibarez drew blood from the tip of her finger, creating a red magic circle.Blood magic \u2018Blood silk\u2019, a carpet woven with blood, rushed forward at a frightening speed and passed in front of the Cyclops\u2019 face.Although it was magic with no lethality, the Cyclops flinched and stopped walking at the strong scent of blood.\u201cNow! Simon!\u201dBefore anyone knew it, two skeletons hanging on the back of the Cyclops placed a chain around its neck. The chain was borrowed from Rick\u2019s subspace.The monster roared and tried to charge at Meilyn, but the chain pulled tight and stopped it from moving. Both ends of the chain had already been anchored to a tree by the skeletons.[Kyaaaaaaaaaaaagh]The Cyclops struggled from the pain from the remaining fires of Dark Flare. Meilyn got around to speeding up her preparations for the next Dark Flare.\u2018H-He actually pulled it off?\u2019A strategy formed in that short time that used the terrain.When she first heard Simon\u2019s plan, she thought he was overplaying it, but Simon carried the plan into practice too easily.Meilyn shot her second Dark Flare while being astonished by Simon\u2019s plan.Roar!The flame that had been extinguished over time blazed fiercely once more.Small veins on Cyclops\u2019 eyes burst open and it screamed madly. It looked like a prisoner in hell struggling with brimstone fire.\u201cHere goes the seventh one!\u201dRick continued to stack up the Exhausts. Now, followed by Camibarez, Simon also joined stacking Exhausts.Creak! Creeaaak!The Cyclops violently struggled. The two trees chained ended up being uprooted.It began to approach while dragging the chains and trees.\u201cLeave it to me!\u201dWhen Rick saw that, he cleverly enchanted the chain with jet-black.Rick\u2019s main specialty was enchantment-based jet-black usage.All the jet-black in the chain was substituted as weight. It was like the Cyclops was crawling with heavy tools.And\u2026\u201cJust die alreadyyyyyyyyyyyy!\u201dWith a shout unlike her usual self, Meilyn\u2019s third Dark Flare exploded on the Cyclops\u2019 body.Thud!Only then did it kneel on the floor. The Cyclops was swallowed whole in the blazing flames, and a disgusting smell of something burning spread throughout the forest.Soon, a pile of ashes was seen falling to the floor.[Simulation succeeded]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Time Spent: 6 minutes and 48 secondsDamage Inflicted: 100%Barrier Gauge: 97%Overall Rating: B\u201cIt wooorked!\u201dMeilyn clenched her fists and shouted.\u201cWoah, woah!

Group 7 embraced each other and ran all over the place, savoring the joy.[Congratulations on clearing, Group 7.]Jane\u2019s comments continued.She pointed out that there was a strong tendency to rely on the ability of one summoner, and the length of hunting time was too long, but overall, it was favorable comments.They decided to raise the mastery of Dark Flare and Curses as much as possible during the rest of the time and the weekend.\u201cThank you, Professor!\u201dAs they walked out of the training room, some students applauded them. There were a lot of envious stares too.It took quite a while, but at least they hunted the Cyclops.\u201cWooh, Simon! As expected from my rival! Well done!\u201dCindy Vivace came over and raised her hand. As Simon also spread his fingers with a smiling face, she high-fived him loudly.\u2018That hurts.\u2019Simon asked while shaking his hands off,\u201cDid your group make it?\u201d\u201cOf course! It was easy after I got the feeling of ghosting!\u201dIf Group 7 was to the extent where Meilyn was the core, Group 5 was really all-in on Cindy Vivace.She turned into a ghosting state that was immune to any physical attacks, dodging the Cyclops\u2019 attacks, and then returned and repeated slashing with the jet-black scythe that her teammates had made.They succeeded in hunting the Cyclops without difficulty.\u201cBy the way, Simon, weren\u2019t you a Necromancy aspirant?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I said I\u2019m not.\u201dWhile everyone was exchanging stories in a friendly atmosphere, only Hector, who was taking a break after finishing the simulation, had a turbulent glow light up in his eyes.* * *Contrary to the popular notoriety about Kizen, Simon was enjoying the best days in his life at Kizen.The classes of Kizen\u2019s professors were tough, but it was without a doubt fun.Talking about performance assessment while chatting with friends during break time, running to eat the limited menu Rick found during lunch break, going to the library in spare time, and getting tutored by Pier about undead management was all just fun.In Curses, the frequency of Professor Bahil accommodating Simon increased significantly. Meilyn now had second thoughts about what Rick said.\u2018Is Professor Bahil actually in favor of Simon?\u2019Of course, Simon shook his head.He had poor grades in Curses, and he fell behind in practical activities because he had no prior learning. He couldn\u2019t find any reason why a person like Bahil, a fan of meritocracy, would favor him.\u201cToday\u2019s class ends here. Have a great weekend.\u201d\u201cThank you for your work!\u201dWith Eric\u2019s Mechanics of Jet-Black as their last class, another week ended safely.PR/n: We\u2019ve changed \u2018Epidemiology of Jet-Black\u2019 to \u2018Mechanics of Jet-Black\u2019 after learning more about the class and finding the latter name more fitting.Tomorrow was finally the weekend!The students were making plans to hang out at Rochest with excited faces.\u201cHow pathetic.\u201dSeeing the students in a cheerful atmosphere, Meilyn grumbled while packing her things.\u201cHow can they think of hanging out in Rochest when the Cyclops performance assessment is next week? They\u2019re hopeless idiots.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dRick, who was sitting down in a chair, giggled as he supported the back of his head with his hands.\u201cAren\u2019t you actually just being petulant because Cami got asked out, but no one\u2019s asking the ace of the Ivory tower to hang out?\u201d\u201cHey!!\u201dThe two started arguing today too, and as Rick said, Camibarez was asked to go out of the classroom by a male student.Even Simon thought she deserved a lot of popularity.A cute appearance, a gentle personality, being kind, and smiling at everyone. There\u2019s no way that male students would just leave her be.Just then, Camibarez, who had just been asked out, ran back into the classroom.\u201cCami! How did it go?\u201dQuickly asked Rick.\u201cUhm\u2026\u2026\u201dShe spoke in a faint voice with her face flushed red.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for him\u2026\u2026 But I refused\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected!\u201dMeilyn\u2019s agitated face became 200% brighter.\u201cCami is thoughtful after all! You\u2019ll stay with us on weekends to practice, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes! I realized that I fell short during the simulation, so\u2026\u2026 I want to practice with you all.\u201dAfter answering like that, Camibarez moved her eyes and looked at Simon\u2019s face.Then, when she met Simon\u2019s eyes, she was startled and quickly looked down.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but~ I\u2019ll pass. Quite busy with my business schedule.\u201dSaid Rick while shrugging.Meilyn glared at him, but she didn\u2019t say anything more than that. For Rick, who aimed to become a merchant, the weekend schedule was as important as a class.Meilyn, with her arms folded, turned toward Simon this time.\u201cSimon, don\u2019t tell me that you also have plans on your weekend like that idiot there?\u201dSimon felt a prick of conscience with Meilyn\u2019s question. He planned to go to the ruins to see Pier on the weekend.\u201c\u2026\u2026Tomorrow might be hard, but I\u2019ll participate in the training the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh, gee! Even you? Don\u2019t you know that your role is the most important in this performance assessment?\u201dSimon quickly waved his hand in denial.\u201cI\u2019m not just going there to play. I\u2019m gonna do my personal training.\u201d\u201cPersonal training?\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s someone in Rochest who looks after my Summoning studies.\u201dMeilyn blinked in surprise.\u201cOh, you got a weekend tutor? So you were aware that you\u2019re lacking in prior learning, huh?\u201d\u201cW-Well, yeah.\u201dCamibarez, who had been lowering her head sullenly, suddenly raised her head.\u201cSt-Still, you\u2019ll see us at Kizen the day after tomorrow, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I still have to sync with you guys.\u201d\u201cWhat a relief!\u201d\u201cHey, Rick! At least come that night too.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll turn out, but I\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cYou really act so busy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a sad woman for being so free on the weekend, Meilyn.\u201d\u201cJust die!\u201dSeeing the two of them fighting, Simon laughed out loud. At the same time, he was contemplating the weekend plans in his head.\u2018There are only a few days left until the actual battle.\u2019Simon was going to train really hard with Pier this weekend.Actually, he didn\u2019t tell the other members of the group, but Simon\u2019s goal this time wasn\u2019t at the level of buying time with the undead.\u2018Defeat the Cyclops with a skeleton.\u2019Simon was planning something that none of the Summoning aspirants of Class A could even dare to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rick personally recommended this store, saying they have the lowest prices.As soon as he opened the door, a young employee greeted him warmly.\u201cWelco\u2014 Uhh?\u201dThe employee smiled brightly.\u201cSimon! It\u2019s you, Simon, right?\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Who\u2019s this again?\u2019Simon was putting his brain to work because of the employee who suddenly pretended to know him, but thankfully, he revealed himself first.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Rowen, the guy you met on the first day of school!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThat great, chatty person who rode the Nether Whale along with him. He was the first friend Simon made after coming to Kizen.\u201cHi! I didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d\u201cGood to see you again! You\u2019re Class A, right? I\u2019m in Class D! Class D is also super tough! I never thought that the half-giant Chatelle Maerre would be part of my class! But there\u2019s Special Admission No.1 is in Class A\u2026 Oh, right! You\u2019re the Special Admission No.1! Woah, right. Yeah! That moment when your identity was revealed at the entrance ceremony, I could feel a shiver go through my entire body\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt started again.Simon quickly changed the topic before it got even more complicated.\u201cBy the way, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m doing my part-time job.\u201dRowen shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI need to earn some pocket money. Part-time jobs at Rochest are great because their pay is pretty high.\u201d\u2018A part-time job, huh? Not bad.\u2019Simon was also starting to get worried about his wallet. It was too much for him to prepare the materials for classes with the monthly allowance that the school provided.\u201cCould I get a part-time job too?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 To be honest, you\u2019re a little bit late now! I think the vacant part-time jobs were all filled last week because there are so many people who want to do it.\u201d\u201cBummer.\u201dNeedless to say, money was important, but he didn\u2019t come here to talk about that.As Simon told Rowen that he came to buy a skeleton set, Rowen kindly showed him where they were.\u201820 sets of Island Rat Man skeletons.\u2019A huge sum of money was used from the start, but he had no other choice. He needed a lot of skeletons for next week\u2019s Cyclops performance assessment.Of course, even if the skeleton\u2019s lifespan expired, he could incorporate them into the Legion\u2019s power, so there was no real loss either.After buying some other undead materials he wanted for practice, Simon left the Necromancer shop.\u2018Now, next is\u2026\u2019Simon rustled and took out the note on the things he needed.\u2018Weapons that skeletons will use.\u2019This time he headed to the weapon shop.You could also buy weapons at the Necromancer shop, but Rick had a clever tip that it\u2019d be expensive to buy them there.\u201cWelcome!\u201dA middle-aged man who ran the weapon shop greeted Simon with a bright smile. As he quickly glanced over Simon\u2019s uniform, his smile deepened even further.\u201cWhat are you looking for? A new model of a jet-black sword made of obsidian was recently released!\u201dThe shop owner handed a sword hanging on the wall in Simon\u2019s hand and told him to remove the scabbard.When Simon applied a little force, the scabbard opened with a clicking sword, revealing a black and shiny blade.\u201cTh-This is a great sword, but I don\u2019t need this much\u2014\u201d\u201cThen what about this! Battle gloves for Combat Magic! Since it\u2019s the latest model, its firepower is\u2014!\u201d\u201cI came to buy weapons for a skeleton!\u201dSaid Simon quickly. The shop owner\u2019s face quickly cooled, and he sat down and pointed to the corner of the store with a nonchalant face.There were a lot of cheap swords on the shelf.\u201cThank you!\u201dRegardless of the shop owner, Simon happily ran towards the shelf. Most of them were failures or secondhand products, but it was perfect for the undead to use.Simon checked the quality by carefully unsheathing the sword, touching the blade, and bouncing it with his fingertips.So he bought five swords, five spears, and two shields.\u201cI\u2019ll have all these, please!\u201dSimon dropped all the weapons on the counter. The shop owner, who was sitting while resting his chin on his hand, asked in surprise,\u201cY-You\u2019re going to buy all of these?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe shop owner started adding up the weapon\u2019s price with a much more loosened-up face. Still, he asked as though he was worried,\u201cWhere are you going to use all this? Aren\u2019t you a first-year? Even if it\u2019s for a skeleton, operating two or three simultaneously would be the maximum.\u201d\u201cJust preparing in advance, since the blade gets damaged very easily.\u201dA smile appeared on the lips of the shop owner, who was examining the weapons Simon had chosen.\u201cYou still picked the ones that are in good condition at least. Looks like you\u2019ve been handling a sword quite often before coming to Kizen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. My father just taught me how to pick good weapons.\u201d\u201cWoah, you have a great father!\u201dThe shop owner let out a hearty laugh.\u201cEven though it\u2019s the era of Necromancers and Priests these days, there\u2019s something called fundamentals, you see. Fundamentals! If you\u2019re a man, you should carry a good-looking sword on your waist and, you know? Be able to protect yourself with that!\u201d\u201cAbsolutely.\u201dApparently, this old man had a great sense of duty in his job.As Simon chimed in with him, the shop owner kept on bursting into laughter as though he felt great.\u201c250 silver on five swords of skeleton-exclusive weapon set, 200 silver on five spears, and 100 silver on wooden shields. It\u2019s 550 silver in total, but I\u2019ll just have 500 silver.\u201d\u201cThank you so much!\u201d\u201cI should be the one to thank you. A young noble is trying to please commoners like us. Ah! Please wait here a moment.\u201dThe equipment merchant went to the back and brought out a bow, arrows, and quivers after a while.\u201cIt\u2019s a bow and arrow set with high jet-black efficiency because it\u2019s made of ebony wood. Originally, I should get 1 gold for this, but this time, I\u2019ll just give it to you.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened rapidly.\u201cF-For free? I can\u2019t receive expensive things like this!\u201d\u201cOh! This isn\u2019t my first time doing business in Rochest. Even though I\u2019m a commoner, I have a good judge of character. Just by looking at people, I can figure out if they\u2019re going home soon, or if they\u2019ll survive through to the third year.\u201dSaid the shop owner while putting the bow on Simon\u2019s pile of weapons.\u201cI\u2019m giving it in a sense for you to be a regular at our store if you\u2019re going to come to buy weapons for 3 years. Even better if you introduce our store to your friends.\u201d\u201cBut still, 1 gold is too\u2014\u201d\u201cBows don\u2019t even sell well in Kizen anyway. Don\u2019t be too pressured to take them. You know how it is, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I know, but\u2026\u2026\u201dIt would be rude not to receive it if he went this far. Simon bowed his head in gratitude.\u201cPlease come again!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon headed to the next place in a cheery mood as he finished his thrifty shopping.He also purchased some materials needed for other classes, like Poisonous Alchemy, and placed them in the subspace.\u2018Pier, I\u2019ll be on my way now.\u2019[Got it!]Then, he headed to the ruins to train with Pier.He was a little afraid to go back to the Forbidden Forest, but Pier was kind enough to pick him up in the forest. As Simon rode on Pier\u2019s back, they reached the ruins in minutes.Click!Clack!\u201cWere you doing well?\u201dAs Simon entered, the conscripted skeletons approached him like puppies greeting their owner. Simon smiled and patted their heads.\u201cPier, here. Skeletons for conscription.\u201dSimon took out the broken skeletons from the subspace.Pier clicked his tongue.[There are a lot of injured ones, huh?]\u201cA lot shattered from the last simulation battle, you see.\u201dAs Pier put his hands on the skulls of the broken skeletons, dark blue flames burned like torches in their eye sockets. Now, the Legion had eight skeletons.[Now it feels a lot more boisterous!]\u201cNice.\u201dAfter the conscription of the damaged skeletons was finished, the two sat down facing each other.[As I said before, training this time will be pretty tough! Are you ready for it?]\u201cYes, of course!\u201dThere was not much time left until the Cyclops performance assessment. Simon was planning on maximizing his skeleton-operating abilities.First, Simon assembled the skeletons he had bought from the Necromancer shop.Soon enough, six skeletons stood in front of Simon with their weapons, and six conscripted skeletons stood on the other side.Simon\u2019s summoned type and Pier\u2019s natural type each formed a team. The skeletons also started a war of nerves with each other, making a rattling sound as though they were aware of it.[You said that the number of skeletons you can control simultaneously is two, right?]\u201cYes.\u201dIf he tried to control more than three units simultaneously, the thoughts in his head got entangled, and the command system fell into disarray.Most of all, he couldn\u2019t bear it as his mental strength rapidly went down, and a bad headache occurred.[Hehehe, there\u2019s no need to rush things! What matters isn\u2019t how many units you can control simultaneously, but how well you can handle them, even if it\u2019s just one or two!]\u201cUnderstood.\u201d[I\u2019ll also control up to two units at the same time! Come at me, Boy!]\u201cYes!\u201dSimon stretched out his right arm.\u2018Charge!\u2019Two skeletons with swords jumped off the floor. Pier also made his two sword-wielding skeletons charge in.Clang!Kang!A continuous clash. The harsh sound of iron hitting iron resounded as the swords collided.As Simon was contemplating on what move to make next, Pier\u2019s two skeletons with spears thrust their weapons from behind.\u2018\u2026\u2026Ugh, step back!\u2019Simon\u2019s skeletons withdrew by a whisker. Then, Pier\u2019s skeletons with swords in front pushed back the skeletons who lost their balance.Clang! Clash!Simon\u2019s skeletons took the sword strikes in a precarious position with their backs bent.Then, as if they were waiting, the skeletons with spears returned and hit the legs with their spears, and Simon\u2019s skeletons fell to the floor, suppressed.\u2018\u2026\u2026I lost.\u2019Swallowing his frustration, Simon lowered his arms and turned his head.\u201cYou\u2019re cheating, Pier! You said you\u2019ll only use two units at once!\u201dThere\u2019s no way he could win since it was 4:2. Pier chuckled at Simon\u2019s complaint.[What are you saying! I also controlled only two units, just like you!]\u201cHuh? What do you m\u2014 Ah!\u201dHe did, actually.Pier first moved the skeletons with the swords, then the skeletons with the spears.He then returned to the skeletons with the swords again, crossed to the spears, and repeated the movement.[Well, it\u2019s not much of a big deal. It\u2019s called cross-operation! It\u2019s to expand the scope of limited control by quickly moving the control of the skeletons.]\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d[If you can\u2019t connect to multiple skeletons simultaneously, the key is to operate two at a time and make all the skeletons move! Did you understand that?]Step step.No sooner said than done, two skeletons with spears came forward among Simon\u2019s skeletons.\u2018Concentrate.\u2019He made the skeletons with swords spread their palms. Then, he went to the skeletons with the spears and high-fived the spread palms.\u201cLike this, right?\u201d[\u2026\u2026]The corners of Pier\u2019s lips, who had stood still for a moment, rose up.[Bwehehehe! You\u2019re certainly fun to teach!]\u201cWhat?\u201d[It\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s move on to the real deal if you got the hang of it!\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Please come!\u201d* * *On the first day of the weekend, Simon practiced undead control and cross-operation with Pier. As his skills had improved, Simon could now control up to 3 units.The next afternoon, he returned to Kizen. He kept in tune alongside Meilyn, Camibarez, and Rick to practice for the actual fight.Simon would try to buy some time with the undeads and the battle would start after striking the Cyclops with four Exhausts and one Dark Flare at the same time.They\u2019d gradually weaken the Cyclops, and the battle will end in victory after giving it two additional Dark Flares.In order to reduce mistakes, they\u2019d only practiced the same pattern repeatedly.It wasn\u2019t an Avalon simulation, and it was nothing but an imaginary battle fought in empty air, but that alone was exhausting. Everyone was sitting on the floor, chugging down some freshwater.\u201cSimon! That tutor you had in Rochest on the weekend\u2026 Who was it?\u201dSimon felt a sting at Camibarez\u2019s question.\u201cI-It\u2019s just someone I met through my father\u2019s help. Why?\u201d\u201cI think Simon\u2019s undead control has improved by a lot!\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s actually true.\u201dRick, who was lying on his back in the vacant lot, sat up.\u201cNow he\u2019s using three skeletons at the same time. Is it even possible to improve your skill in such a short time?\u201dMeilyn also pushed her head in as if she was interested.\u201cWhat kind of person are they? A professional Necromancer? From Kizen?\u201dAll of a sudden, the eyes of the three people were focused at once. Simon smiled awkwardly.\u2018\u2026\u2026What kind of excuse should I make?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pier\u2019s clone hanging on Simon\u2019s school uniform as a decoration grinned as though he enjoyed the situation.[Kwahahahahaha! I\u2019m pretty popular among the kids!]\u2018\u2026\u2026My head is ringing, so please be quiet, Pier.\u2019[Tell them that I\u2019m willing to teach! If they die and become a member of the Legion!]\u2018You see, in Kizen, it\u2019s forbidden to turn a living person into an undead.\u2019Simon forced himself to put a smile on his face and opened his mouth.\u201cSorry. He\u2019s a person who\u2019s really reluctant to reveal his identity. And he\u2019s really busy too. Teaching me alone is already a huge hindrance to his work.\u201dMeilyn made a sullen face.\u201cSo you\u2019re not telling us, huh? How petty.\u201dRick giggled while leaning back into his hands behind his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not being petty, but it\u2019s something natural. Simon might have to leave the school if your Summoning grade goes up, you know? Would you share if you were in Simon\u2019s position?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Th-That\u2019s true, but\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. I can\u2019t share because he\u2019s just really busy.\u201d\u201cNow, now!\u201dIt was always Camibarez who arbitrated quarrels. She jumped up to her feet and clenched her fists.\u201cWe rested for 10 minutes already! Let\u2019s get back to practicing!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s already been that long?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s quickly do one more round!\u201dThe practice for the performance assessment continued till late at night.* * *The weekend had passed, and a new week came with the scheduled Cyclops performance assessment.At the same time, there was one big change in Kizen\u2019s school life from this week on.Which was\u2026\u201cScott Snyder, I\u2019m deducting you 10 points.\u201dThat the student protection period had completely ended.The professors could officially evaluate and grade the students now, and they could also punish or take disciplinary action.\u201cDid you bring this garbage as an assignment?\u201d\u201cToo slow! Too slow! Everyone\u2019s so damn slow! Assistants! Deduct 20 points to all students who aren\u2019t keeping up with the progress right now!\u201d\u201cGet out of my class right now.\u201dThe professors of Kizen revealed their true colors as if they were waiting for it.Their attitudes had completely flipped, to the point that it almost made the students doubt if they were the same professors who treated them with kindness.Classes became harder, and students who couldn\u2019t keep up with the classes were mercilessly deducted. Students who were judged to be underperforming were also expelled from class.Students were weeping at the changed attitude of the professors, but only now could they feel the reality that they were in Kizen.Weaklings weren\u2019t needed in Kizen.As proof of that statement, 20 people packed their things after the student protection period was lifted for two days.Despite the midterm exam, performance assessment, and duel assessment not yet being conducted, the dropout rate was this high.Simon also had a hard time adjusting to the changed atmosphere during the two days when the student protection period was lifted.If there was a professor who treated students the same as before\u2026\u201cCome on, run!\u201d\u201cYes Miss!\u201dIt was Hong Feng of Combat Magic.To speak the truth, she didn\u2019t really care about the student protection period at all, as she made the students hang on a running hippo and climb a hill with a curse on since the beginning of the class. She even recklessly bumped them into a herd of hippos.So, unlike other professors\u2019 classes, where their difficulty jumped, Hong Feng\u2019s classes were the same. The students came to a point where they felt relatively comfortable with the Combat Magic class.Of course, Hong Feng wasn\u2019t really a professor who nitpicked students and gave them deductions or put pressure on them mentally either.\u201cHuff! Huff! Still, it\u2019s way better to run thoughtlessly like this!\u201dRick, who was running next to Simon, said this while breathing heavily.\u201cI still remember the eyes of Professor Bahil, who gave me 10 point deductions in a row! Huff! Huff! Hurray to Combat Magic, fucker! I\u2019m going to take it in the 2nd semester too!\u201dSimon giggled.\u201cHah hah! You guys are so relaxed!\u201dSimon and Rick turned their heads.\u201cHuh? Meilyn?\u201dMeilyn, who was always behind in every running session, was catching up with the two today. She was running frantically even though she looked like she was out of breath and panicking.\u201cHuff! Phew! What\u2019s gotten into you? Can you just raise your pace recklessly like that?\u201dInstead of answering, Meilyn bit her lip and ran past the two of them in the end. Rick\u2019s eyes shook.\u201c\u2026\u2026How desperate. Huff! By the way, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\u201cTomorrow is the Cyclops performance assessment, you see.\u201dAs the leader of Group 7 and the participating member, she felt a strong sense of responsibility for this Cyclops performance assessment, more so than anyone else.Meilyn\u2019s biggest weakness was her lack of stamina and slow movements, making it hard for her to dodge the Cyclops\u2019 attacks properly. So, she focused more on training her stamina than Dark Flare for the rest of her time.\u2018Honestly, she\u2019s really amazing.\u2019Ranking 1st in the written entrance exam.1st in Class A.The only person with an average score of 90\u2019s on Jane\u2019s test.Simon thought that Meilyn was only a genius, but in reality, she was an extremely hard worker.According to Camibarez, Meilyn didn\u2019t even sleep properly so she could study.They studied together until late at night in the female dormitory lounge, and when she went back after sleeping the next morning, she could still see Meilyn studying with a tissue in her nose.She said that she overcame her fatigue and drowsiness with drugs and potions so that it wouldn\u2019t interfere with her during class.From morning until she fell asleep, study, study, study, study.Simon had no idea as to what made her so persistent.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNow, rest!\u201dAs soon as Hong Feng\u2019s instructions were given, the students laid on the grass as though they were waiting for it. The assistant teachers went around and distributed stamina recovering drinks.\u201cErrrgh.\u201dRick, who emptied his drink at one go, sprawled out on the ground.\u201cOne thing I\u2019m sure of is that, if you take Combat Magic classes for 3 years, you\u2019ll be so buff by the time you graduate. I\u2019m certain about this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing Rick\u2019s joke, Camibarez touched her leg.Simon saw that and giggled a little.\u201cDoing some running in combat classes won\u2019t get you muscles, Cami.\u201d\u201cWhat? What?! No! It\u2019s not like that!\u201cCami\u2019s quite slender, so it\u2019s okay for her to be a little thicker.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s nothing like that!\u201dMeilyn approached at a quick pace at that moment when the sound of friendly laughter lingered between the three of them.\u201cSimon! Please take a look at me.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThat thing where you step on the jet-black\u2026\u201dShe bent her knees and jumped in place. It was considerably high, and jet-black was formed properly under her legs.Woooosh!While sliding over the grass, she came down and looked back at Simon with her eyes shining.\u201cWhat do you think? What do you think?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Mm.\u201dSimon scratched his head.\u201cYou\u2019re really good. I mean it.\u201d\u201cReally? Really? Fufu! I kept on practicing for tomorrow, you see!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really amazing, Meilyn!\u201dTo overcome a weakness in such a short time. As Camibarez said, it was an amazing achievement.Of course, she must\u2019ve put in a near unimaginable amount of effort behind the scenes.She looked like she abused her feet till now. The state of them didn\u2019t look that good when she was landing.\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard, Meilyn.\u201dWorriedly said Simon.\u201cWe were able to hunt the Cyclops during the simulation, you see? The success of the performance assessment is somewhat in our reach.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, but I won\u2019t be satisfied with just success.\u201dA fire lit up in Meilyn\u2019s eyes.\u201c1st place. I\u2019m trying my best to get 1st place.\u201dWhen Simon was about to open his mouth to say something, the assistant teachers clapped their hands.\u201cCome on everyone, get up! We\u2019ll run to the next destination now!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe students, who had become accustomed to Hong Feng\u2019s class now, quickly got up and stood in line.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dWith Hong Feng\u2019s shout, everyone went down the hill while enjoying the cool breeze.This place where yellow grape blossoms were in full bloom looked like the whole mountain covered in gold.Simon couldn\u2019t help but admire Hong Feng\u2019s eye for choosing only the places with beautiful natural scenery as a class location.\u201cSimon!\u201dJust then, Hong Feng came out of nowhere. Simon replied in surprise,\u201cAh, yes Professor?!\u201d\u201cAre you practicing the jet-black operation I taught you properly?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dHong Feng had taught Simon the technique of temporarily increasing the body\u2019s capability by activating the jet-black in the body.\u201cOh, as expected, you learn it really fast! No matter how much I think about it, Combat Magic would suit you so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Ahaha.\u201d\u201cProfessor!\u201dIt was then. Brett, a Combat Magic assistant teacher, came running.Brett glanced at Simon once, then quickly turned his head to report to Hong Feng.\u201cSomebody got hurt in the back row. A student seemed to have cut their leg a bit.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019ll go check it out.\u201dHong Feng patted Simon on the shoulder and ran after Brett. Another assistant teacher then led the students down the hill and called a break.Everyone sat on the grass and drank the refreshments.\u201cCami, where\u2019s Meilyn?\u201dWith Rick\u2019s question, Camibarez shrugged her shoulders.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I thought she\u2019s with you guys because I kept on falling behind.\u201dAt that moment, crowds talking could be heard from behind.After looking back, Simon jumped to his feet and Camibarez covered her mouth with both hands.\u201cHey, Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u201dRick\u2019s complexion turned pale as ashes. A female student was seen on an assistant teacher\u2019s back among the whispering students.A bandage was wrapped around her ankle.\u201cMeilyn!\u201d* * *Kizen\u2019s central ward.Meilyn was lying down in the bed like a soulless person.Simon, Rick, and Camibarez were standing around her with hardened faces.\u201cMeilyn Villenne.\u201dThe doctor in white robes said while turning through the documents,\u201cYou sprained your leg badly. For the time being, make use of crutches, and going to classes is fine, but make sure to skip all classes with physical activities for around a week.\u201dThe news struck like a lightning bolt from the blue. Meilyn raised her upper body with reddened eyes.\u201cN-No! I can walk if it\u2019s just this much of an injury!\u201d\u201cMs. Villenne.\u201dThe doctor smiled and tapped the profile.\u201cThis is an order, not a recommendation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn strongly bit her lip.\u201cI get that you\u2019re passionate about the class, but there are things without exceptions. I\u2019m going to exclude you from all classes that require walking.\u201dThis was the reason why Kizen students didn\u2019t want to go to the ward, even if they got sick or hurt.Doctors prioritized the patient\u2019s recovery, and students had survival in Kizen as their priority.These two values have always been in conflict with each other.It was natural for doctors to give students a break for a few weeks when they were seriously injured in class, but in time, the absence strains the student\u2019s necks.It was your own loss if you got injured.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe doctor who gave a one-sided notice went out, and a thick silence dropped in the ward with only the four of them left.Everyone prepared so much for the performance assessment, but the participating member injured her leg on the eve of the actual battle.But no one blamed Meilyn.It was an accident, and everyone knew that Meilyn worked harder on this group activity than anyone else.\u201c\u2026\u2026Meilyn.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. Please leave.\u201dMeilyn lowered her head and said,\u201cI want to be alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer face was of a complete meltdown. It didn\u2019t seem like any kind of comfort would work at the moment.Rick and Camibarez looked at each other and nodded.\u201cS-Simon.\u201dCamibarez called Simon in a low voice and grabbed his sleeve. But Simon didn\u2019t move.\u201cNothing\u2019s going to change, even if you cry here like this.\u201dCamibarez and Rick were surprised. It was a very cold statement that was unlike the usual Simon.Meilyn bit her lip even harder and lifted her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Then what?\u201d\u201cWe have to find another way.\u201d\u201cA way? Hah.\u201dShe laughed. It was a very self-mocking and hysterical laugh.\u201cYou know it too, right? This is the tactic that we worked hard and planned on for a week! We practiced desperately only in this position, and tomorrow is the actual battle against the living Cyclops! What the hell do you mean by a way? Ah~ I see! Are you being sarcastic to me right now? Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s all because of me! The reason why you guys will get the lowest score in the performance assessment! Even if this score will be a hindrance later and drop you guys out of Kizen! It\u2019s all my fault! If only I didn\u2019t hurt my leg by pushing my se\u2014\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes gleamed. The three of them suddenly felt goosebumps rising up their backs. Was that really Simon? It almost felt like he was a different person.As the surroundings became quiet, Simon let out a small sigh and said,\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you guys, I\u2019ll go out as the participating member tomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Class A students were moving to the underground dungeon in carriages.\u201cIsn\u2019t it fascinating?\u201dSaid Camibarez while looking out the window inside the carriage.\u201cTo think that this many dungeons and ruins are gathered on the small Roke Island\u2026\u2026\u201dRick shrugged his shoulders.\u201cFrom what I heard, Nefthis is a manic collector. If she finds these kinds of ancient ruins, she apparently transfers the whole thing to Roke Island.\u201d\u201cWoah! The whole ruins?\u201dRick and Camibarez chatted and tried to loosen the uncomfortable atmosphere, but Simon and Meilyn didn\u2019t speak a word until they reached the dungeon.\u201cCome on, we\u2019re here! Everyone, get off!\u201dFinally, the carriages stopped, and the students came down.The eyes of the students who were making a lot of noise before the actual battle turned to Meilyn, who got off the carriage with crutches.\u201c\u2026\u2026They\u2019re doomed.\u201d\u201cI heard that she\u2019s the participating member and injured herself.\u201dThe students whispered.\u201cIf the participating member is in that state, they can\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s all screwed up from the start till the end.\u201d\u201cWell, it helps us.\u201d\u201cShh! Shh! Hey, your voice is too loud!\u201dMeilyn firmly moved forward while trying her best to ignore the whispers.The members of Group 7 followed right behind her.Kizen\u2019s underground dungeon was some sort of supersized prison that kept the monsters from the continent captured. Not only monsters, but all kinds of terrible criminals in the continent were also said to be imprisoned at the bottom of the dungeon.Following the assistant teacher, the students moved their eyes with fear. Terrible screams and monster roars were heard from everywhere.\u201cIt\u2019s an unconfirmed rumor, but they say that an angel is chained and sealed on the bottom floor of this dungeon.\u201dWith Rick\u2019s words, Camibarez flinched, and her shoulders shuddered.\u201cP-Please don\u2019t scare me! There\u2019s no way an angel exists!\u201d\u201cHehehe. You think there are no angels when there are devils too?\u201dFortunately, they didn\u2019t go deep into the dungeon.The destination was a place tightly surrounded by bricks carved out of rocks. Like in the training room, a mana projector was hanging on the ceiling.\u201cThis way.\u201dWhen they entered, they saw Jane and her assistants, who arrived first and were waiting inside. It was Jane\u2019s first class after the student protection period had ended, so everyone stood up with nervous faces.She opened her mouth.\u201cNow, attention.\u201d\u201cAttention!\u201d\u201cIn the morning, we\u2019ll conduct a performance assessment from groups 1 to 8. When you enter the dungeon, you\u2019ll face a living Cyclops.\u201dThe assistant teachers went around and handed out paperboards and pens to the students.The life waiver that Jane mentioned in the first class, that no matter what happened in the dungeon, Kizen wouldn\u2019t be held responsible.\u201cOf course, you can put down the life waiver and leave if your life is more important than anything else.\u201dIt was something that everyone was prepared for from the moment they entered Kizen. All the students signed the life waiver, and the assistant teachers distributed training uniforms.\u201cAgain, there are three instances in which the performance assessment will be stopped. When the participating member is incapable of combat, when any team member raises their hand and declares abandonment of the test, and when a professor or safety guard determines that further battle is impossible. And Andrew, a personnel dispatched from Kizen headquarters, will be in charge of the safety guard.\u201dStanding next to Jane, a man heavily armed with different kinds of equipment bowed his head. He looked taciturn.\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll start the performance assessment with Group 1.\u201d* * *Group 1 remained, and the other members were guided to the room upstairs. It was a place to take a rest like the waiting room, but one wall was transparent like glass, so you could directly watch the other groups fighting.\u201cI-It\u2019s a real Cyclops!\u201d\u201cThe scale\u2026 It\u2019s no joke.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t believe that it was a real battle until the very end.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do? For real\u2026\u2026\u201dThe waiting room was noisy with students watching the Cyclops, but Simon and his group didn\u2019t have time to leisurely watch the other groups fight.The four of them sat in a quiet corner on the opposite side and discussed plans.\u201cNow now. Let\u2019s loosen up the mood a bit! We still have a winning shot!\u201dRick clapped and proceeded with the meeting.Everyone exchanged opinions in a serious atmosphere. Cheering and screaming was occasionally heard from the students.You could also know which teams won and which teams failed. Of course, Hector and Group 3 succeeded in hunting.Time passed faster than light, and finally\u2026\u201cGroup 7, to the front.\u201dNot knowing how an hour or two had passed, it was already Group 7\u2019s turn.All of the members of Group 7 went down with the guidance of the assistant teacher. The students, who had been quiet until Meilyn went down, rushed to the transparent wall.\u201cMeilyn injured her leg, but it looks like they\u2019re gonna continue.\u201d\u201cIs that allowed? I\u2019m sure the doctor put a restriction on her.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Wait a second!\u201dSomeone pointed at one side of the wall. Simon was wearing the protective vest that was worn by the participating member.\u201cIt\u2019s Simon! They changed the participating member to Simon Polentia!\u201d\u201cWould that be okay?\u201d\u201cOf course not! They\u2019ve been relying on Meilyn\u2019s Dark Flare all this time. All their plans are screwed up at this point.\u201d\u201cBut how will a Summoning aspirant hunt down a Cyclops?\u2019\u201cI guess they\u2019re just trying to show that they tried their best till the end.\u201dHector, who was sitting on the two seats, had a sharp shine go across his eyes.\u201cSimon Polentia is the participating member?\u201d\u201cA-Apparently, yeah?\u201dSaid a male student from Hector\u2019s faction while forcing himself to smile.\u201cIsn\u2019t he someone that got on your nerves? Is it alright for you not to watch them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHector closed his eyes without answering.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cPhewwww.\u201dSimon took a deep breath, calming his trembling heart. As he put on the vest, a barrier gauge appeared from the mana projector on the ceiling.When this gauge reached 0%, the participating member was automatically judged as incapable of combat, and the test would immediately be stopped. Behind Simon was Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez standing in their set positions. Fortunately, Meilyn persuaded the doctor, allowing her to play a support role that didn\u2019t move from its position.\u201cNothing big has changed.\u201dSaid Simon while turning back to the members.\u201cEven if the situation has changed a little, it\u2019s not like our efforts disappeared. Let\u2019s do our best until the end.\u201dThe three nodded.Meilyn, who had been dazed for a while, had a terribly serious expression on her face, as though she came to her senses when the performance assessment started.Safety Guard Andrew looked at his watch and said,\u201cPlease send in the next Cyclops.\u201dRattle!The iron bars of the dungeon went up. The real Cyclops in chains showed itself from the pitch-black darkness. Four Keepers were whining and pulling the chains, leading the Cyclops.Gulp.As he faced the monster, Simon\u2019s throat went dry.Its appearance was the same as he had seen in the simulation, but the real thing was definitely something different. Its stench stung his nose, and the unpleasant breathing was heard irregularly.His heart was beating like crazy with the tension. It was terrifying to think of\u2026 meeting that kind of monster in the mountains.And above the Cyclops\u2019 head, a jet-black magic circle was seen floating around.He has lost his focus because of the curse in that magic circle, but as soon as the curse was lifted, he\u2019d regain consciousness and begin to attack the opponent in front of him.Click! Clack!The keepers removed the chains and fled from the dungeon in a hurry.[Then, we\u2019ll start the performance assessment of Group 7.]Jane\u2019s voice could be heard from the ceiling.[There\u2019s no need to overdo it. If you think you can\u2019t do it, anyone can raise their hand and ask to stop the assessment\u2026]\u201cYes, Professor!\u201dAndrew, the safety guard, went invisible and disappeared at some point too.Now, only the four people of Group 7 and the Cyclops were left in this place.[Removing the curse. We\u2019ll commence with the assessment.]The magic circle floating above the Cyclops\u2019 head shattered with a clank. At the same time, the monster\u2019s eyes, which had lost all focus, flashed and returned.[Gwooooooooooooooooooaaagh!]It let out a huge roar. Simon felt like his body would blow away from just the blast of the wind.\u201cSimon! Hang in there!\u201dThe battle started immediately. Simon pulled the imaginary lever and took out the skeletons.Three armed skeletons ran in from different directions.\u2018Just do as practiced, just do as practiced!\u2019Although the participating member changed, the framework of the strategy hadn\u2019t changed significantly.While Simon buys time with the skeletons, Rick, Camibarez, and Meilyn go cursing. It was a strategy to neutralize the Cyclops by stacking up Exhausts to the limit and Simon stabbing the vitals of the Cyclops to knock it down.However\u2026Bang!The Cyclops didn\u2019t deal with the skeletons. It charged like a chariot and smashed the skeletons with his body and rushed toward Simon right away.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cWh-What\u2019s going on?\u201dWith bloodshot eyes, the Cyclops swung its club wildly.Thump!Simon hurriedly threw his body to the side. The club fell where he was, and the dungeon shook violently.\u201cRick! Why is this happening?\u201dAsked Camibarez in bewilderment as she prepared the curse.\u201cIt\u2019s different from the simulation!\u201d\u201cAre they trying to show that simulations and reality are different? No, but this is\u2026\u2026\u201dRick slightly bit his lips.\u2018It\u2019s as if it\u2019s coming after Simon from the beginning!\u2019Bam! Bam! Bam!The Cyclops swung its club frantically while drooling from its mouth.Simon had to avoid it by rolling on the ground like a ball against the brutal offense.\u201cUgh!\u201dHis back hurt because of the bumpy stone ground. After dodging all the attacks, Simon jumped up and stretched out his right arm.Rattle!The skeleton who grabbed the Cyclops\u2019 back slashed it with a sword.\u2018Kugh! It\u2019s a lot harder than the simulation!\u2019There wasn\u2019t even a scratch on its skin. Perhaps because it didn\u2019t do much damage, the Cyclops still ignored the skeleton and only attacked Simon.\u2018Calm down.\u2019Simon\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2018Smashing down diagonally.\u2019Simon bent his legs and momentarily leaned to the side. The club just crossed above the direction where he leaned.\u2018Side swing with a wide breadth!\u2019The Cyclops\u2019 attack missed again as Simon took a short step and slipped back. The students watching from upstairs exclaimed at Simon\u2019s splendid movements.Of course, Simon, who was doing it, felt like dying.\u2018To think that I ended up using the analysis I did to help Meilyn!\u2019[Gwooooooooooah!]At that time, when the enraged Cyclops was about to turn around and rush in\u2026\u201cExhaust!\u201dThe three people standing in the set position finally activated the Exhausts. The movement of the Cyclops briefly slowed down, and Simon dug into that moment.Simon, who jumped on the jet-black, stretched his arm out behind him. The spear thrown by the skeleton went into Simon\u2019s hand.\u2018A chance!\u2019Whish!Simon\u2019s spear flashed like lightning towards the Cyclops\u2019 eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The infuriated Cyclops swung its club like crazy.Thummp! Thummp! Thuuuuuuump!Every time the club hit the ground and wall, the dungeon shook. Simon\u2019s movements in responding and avoiding these attacks looked truly amazing, but in reality, he was in a very precarious state.\u2018Th-Thank you, Professor Hong Feng\u2026\u2026!\u2019If it wasn\u2019t for the jet-black operation that she taught him. He would\u2019ve been knocked out a while ago.

It was all grazes, but what in the world\u2026\u2026?!\u2019Thud! Thud!

She had a scoring sheet in her hand, and even at this moment, she was moving her quill quickly.\u201cProfessor Jane! I think there\u2019s something wrong with the Cyclops!\u201dSaid the assistant teacher standing right next to her with a hardened face.\u201cIt far exceeds the stats of the Cyclopes that other groups faced!! It\u2019s enraged and doesn\u2019t even get affected with Curses that well!

Everyone succeeded in hunting with Exhaust, but why are we the only ones\u2014!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know why either.\u201dSimon raised his head and observed the Cyclops carefully.Bloodshot eyes, explosive muscles, and strangely bulging tendons.Was it that we were unlucky to meet the one in good shape?\u201cI also agree with Simon. It\u2019s a matter of the fact that the Exhausts aren\u2019t working right now.\u201dRick also put in a word. Meilyn was only one reluctant to give up with the Exhaust strategy, but it was hard to deny that the Cyclops wasn\u2019t affected.Simon spoke again..\u201cSo we have to hunt it down in a different way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How?\u201dMeilyn looked like she was about to cry.Honestly, it even felt a little unfair. Everything was getting screwed up too much.The participating member, the drawing of attention with the undead, and even the cursing didn\u2019t work.Everything they had planned was in vain. What more were they supposed to do here?\u201cJust, do whatever you want.\u201dSwiiiing!Simon, who had avoided the Cyclops\u2019 club falling on him diagonally, continued.\u201cCancel all the strategies we\u2019ve made up until now, and just help me as you please.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?!\u201dThump!Simon slightly lost his posture after dodging the third attack. As the Cyclops, who seized the chance, was about to swing the club again\u2026Slide!A red wave with a strong scent of blood passed by in front of the Cyclops\u2019 face. As his vision suddenly turned red, the bewildered monster took a step back.\u201cGot it!\u201dCamibarez, who had cast the blood magic \u2018Blood Silk\u2019, winked.\u201cI just have to help you as I want, right?\u201d\u201cSimon!\u201dRick enchanted the sword he took out of the subspace and threw it.\u201cUse this!\u201dThe sword that Rick threw was flying behind the Cyclops\u2019 back. When everyone who saw this realized where he threw it, a skeleton appeared like a wind and grabbed the sword.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Slaaaash!It turned its back and swung the sword. A long scar formed on the thick skin near the Cyclops\u2019 waist, and blood gushed out. The Cyclops looked at the skeleton in anger.\u201cRick! Nice enchant!\u201dWhile skeletons lured the Cyclops\u2019 attack, Simon gave it a little more distance.Rick pulled out a bunch of weapons from the subspace and started throwing them with enchants, and Camibarez annoyed the Cyclops by obscuring its vision with the Blood Silk.\u2018Now, focus.\u2019There were still too many miscellaneous thoughts. As the fierce battle continued\u2026 It might\u2019ve been insane, but Simon closed his eyes. The noise in the field subsided in an instant.His consciousness expanded and his spirit was enhanced.\u2018Phewwwwwww.\u2019The sound disappeared, and time slowed. It was the world that Bahil showed him in the Curses class.With one experience, Simon was able to partially reproduce the image.\u2018Thank you, Professor Bahil!\u2019Simon opened his eyes. Twenty skeletons burst out at once from the subspace on the ground.\u2018Thank you, Pier!\u2019He sent three skeletons at a time to the Cyclops through cross operation. Soon, the skeletons densely surrounded the Cyclops.The enraged Cyclops swung its club. In one blow, several skeletons were broken and scattered on the ground. Bones flew in all directions and rolled around on the ground.Of course, it didn\u2019t really matter.\u2018Restore!\u201dIn an instant, a skeleton that returned to its original shape picked up a sword that had fallen to the ground and swung it.Slaaaash!Cyclops\u2019 heel was slashed, and a chunk of flesh was sliced off.Clink!A skeleton on the ground raised its spear and stabbed the Cyclops, who staggered as its heels were cut.Slash!Another skeleton swung his sword and left a long gash on the Cyclops\u2019 back.\u201cHere comes two more spears!\u201dRick placed jet-black enchantments on the weapons and scattered them randomly around the Cyclops. Simon then moved the skeletons.The remains of the skeletons scattered on the ground were restored, and they attacked the Cyclops with the dropped weapons.No matter how fast and strong it was, it couldn\u2019t block attacks coming from all sides.The Cyclops could hardly come to its senses. When it looked to its front, its back was slashed. When it looked back, a spear came up from the ground. When it stomped the ground, its sides were suddenly attacked.The Cyclops was like a beast caught in a trap. Its body started to get covered with wounds as it struggled.\u201cWooooooaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cGo for it!\u201dThe students of Class A, who were watching from upstairs, stuck themselves against the transparent wall and burst into cheers. It was a different, out-of-the-box kind of strategy, unlike the ones that had been monotonously conducted so far. Engulfed in exaltation, Simon swung his arms like a conductor and controlled the skeletons.Still, it wasn\u2019t enough. The tip of his nose was itchy.Something was lacking. It felt like he could do better than this.[Do you now understand, Boy?! The stronger your determination is, the higher you can raise the potential power and initiative of the undead!]Determination.A determination stronger than anything.Simon opened his eyes wide.\u2018Kill it!\u2019The restoration speed of damaged skeletons became faster.\u2018Kill it!\u2019The skeletons\u2019 limbs flew around chaotically and slashed the Cyclops.\u2018Kill it!!!\u2019The undead roared. The weapons danced.At this moment, under Simon\u2019s Absolute Order, the Legion existed to destroy the Cyclops.A tireless offense.A striking route without a pattern.A mixture of irregular and regular.It was a scene that really showed the essence of a Necromancer.[Kyaaaaaaaaagh!]The Cyclops burst into anger from the countless wounds all over its body, pierced through the skeletons, and rushed at Simon.\u201cDodge it! Simon!\u201dSimon was now in a state of complete immersion beyond concentration. His reaction was late. Before Simon could be ready, the Cyclops\u2019 club was falling on his head.<Jet-black elemental magic: Dark Ice \u2014 Wall of Ice>Pooow!The black ice wall that rose from the magic circle on the ground deflected the Cyclops\u2019 club. Startled, Simon looked back.\u201cGo on, Simon!\u201dMeilyn clenched her teeth and shouted,\u201cSince it came to this, don\u2019t lose!\u201dThe ice wall continued to rise, obstructing the movement of the Cyclops. It tried to break out of the wall, and the blood from his wounds soaked the black glacier.Simon, who could take a breath thanks to this, stared at the Cyclops breaking the ice wall and prepared for the next dark spell.Slaaaaaam!In the end, the enraged Cyclops broke down all the walls and jumped at Simon.\u2018\u2026\u2026This is dangerous.\u2019Safety Guard Andrew, who had been watching in silence, stretched out his arm.That attack was strong enough to pierce the barrier of Simon\u2019s vest with one blow. He could get crippled if he received a direct hit.\u2018For goodness sake. This professor and these students\u2026\u2026!\u2019I need to stop this insanity right now.The moment Andrew decided to shoot down the Cyclops, he saw a magic circle.A blood-red magic circle was drawn in the middle of the Cyclops\u2019 abdomen.\u201cNow\u2019s the time, Cami!\u201dHearing Simon\u2019s shout, Andrew hurriedly withdrew his arm.Whaaaap!Jet-black blazed like flames from all over Camibarez\u2019s body, who was standing in the set position. Her hair surged up, and jet-black resembling tears of blood flowed from her eyes.The blood magic that only vampires of the Ursula family could use.The flower among flowers in blood magic.<Hemorrhage \u2014 Overflow>Woooooooosh!Forearms, chest, shoulders, thighs, and heels. Fountains of blood gushed out all at once from the countless wounds that Simon\u2019s skeletons had inflicted until now.Bleeding and Poisoning spells were the most powerful means of support that a member in the set position could provide.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026!!\u201dThe scene where that large monster bled from the wounds all over its body was both terrifying and surprising. In an instant, the inside of the dungeon was dyed red. Simon, who was watching from behind, also showed admiration.\u2018So this is Hemorrhage magic!\u2019While talking about each other\u2019s powers, everyone in Group 7 knew that Camibarez could use Hemorrhage magic.However, it was nothing but a plan B because it wasn\u2019t stable enough to use in actual battle, and there was a build-up problem where you had to somehow create a lot of wounds on the Cyclops\u2019 body.But now that Meilyn\u2019s Dark Flare was sealed, it was definitely the main plan.Camibarez was the main attacker in this fight.\u201c\u2026\u2026Urk!\u201dCamibarez, who had poured out too much energy, flopped on the ground while staggering with anemia. Her job was now done.\u201cI\u2019m counting on you, Simon!\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dThis time, Simon raised his arms up.A skill that he had been practicing over and over until now. In fact, it was a secret skill that, across the entirety of Kizen\u2019s first-years, was only known by Simon.Skeleton bones scattered all over the dungeon ground soared into the air.\u2018Thank you, Professor Aaron!\u2019Everything I learned in Kizen became my strength.Simon clenched his fist.<Simon Polentia Original \u2014 Bone Nail>Numerous bones that floated in the air flew forward and dug into the wounds of the Cyclops opened by Camibarez\u2019 Hemorrhage magic.[Kieeeeeeeeegh!!]A secret technique to attack over a hundred wounds at once.The Cyclops went berserk from the pain. It screamed, knocked itself over, and started recklessly banging its head against the wall.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not over yet.\u2019Simon clenched his fist and twisted his right arm to the side.\u2018Restore!\u2019The bones penetrated into the wounds and started gathering towards the center to carry out the \u2018Restore\u2019 order. It cut off blood vessels, ripped organs, and penetrated through muscles.[Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!]The Cyclops was getting destroyed.\u201c\u2026\u2026For real?\u201dA male student who was watching through the glass wall in the waiting room opened his mouth.A painful loss called Meilyn\u2019s injury. No one could\u2019ve imagined such an overwhelming scene from Group 7.But\u2026\u201cFuck! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cWay to go, Simon!\u201d\u201cWooooooaaaaaah!\u201dEveryone\u2019s expectations were turned upside down.The people who jeered, the people who clicked their tongues, and the people who showed sympathy. They all cheered while banging on the wall.There was something that heated up their hearts as Necromancers in the performance that Simon and Group 7 showed, to the point where they completely forgot that they were competing with each other.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dSimon\u2019s right arm went limp. It was impossible to order further restorations, since he had used up all the remaining jet-black on his bones.Meanwhile, Rick and Meilyn took out the Nervie potions and threw them at the wounded Cyclops. You could see its muscles twisting and contracting as soon as the potion liquid entered the wound.\u201cNice!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201dSimon was panting while on one knee.They\u2019d now done everything that they could.\u2018Please, just stay like that.\u2019Thump!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *But\u2026The Cyclops, covered in blood, began to lift itself back up. Camibarez, who was flopped on the ground, gave a look of terror on her face.\u201cI-It can\u2026\u2026 still stand?\u201dEven though the bones of its body were twisted, its blood was drained, and its organs were smashed, the Cyclops was approaching Simon like a living corpse. In its gleaming eyes, he could feel a desperate will to kill him.\u2018So it\u2019s meaningless unless it\u2019s instant death, huh?\u2019Receiving those glares, Simon calmly said,\u201cRick.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all ready! Take it!\u201dRick threw the enchanted claymore in front of Simon. The sword body was dyed in jet-black.\u201cI have put all my jet-black in there! The duration is just 10 minutes!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSimon grabbed the handle of the claymore and took a stance. He could no longer use the activation technique that he learned from Hong Feng either.A situation in which both monster and Simon ran out of strength. From now on, it was a battle of will.Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!The Cyclops, resembling a living corpse, came running.Dash!Simon also rushed forward, holding the claymore. The Cyclops swung its club first.Wooooosh!Simon twisted his body sideways to dodge it.The movement of the Cyclops was incomparably slow and sluggish compared to how it was at first. And when Simon was about to catch its weakness\u2026\u2018Huh?\u2019His vision flickered. Because he was pushing the Cyclops, he didn\u2019t even realize that his power, both physically and mentally, was at the limit.His right leg gave up and slipped, making Simon\u2019s body roll on the ground.\u201cSimon!\u201d\u201cGet up!!\u201dSimon clenched his teeth and stood up. The Cyclops ran toward him again and swung its club. Simon lowered his body to avoid it.\u201cGo Simon!\u201d\u201cDodge it!!\u201dClass A students were sticking to the glass wall and shouting at the top of their lungs.Even Hector, who had already approached, violently pushing the students away, was fuming while looking down at Simon.\u2018No way.\u2019The assistant teacher who was watching this scene from the monitor room was in shock.Of course, Simon\u2019s performance was also surprising, but\u2026\u2018Professor Jane\u2026\u2026 stood up?\u2019She even dropped the scoring sheet she was holding, staring intently at the screen.He had her as his boss for five years, but this was his first time seeing her acting like this.Inside the dungeon, Andrew, who\u2019d been on standby while hiding his body, looked at his palm.It was brimming with sweat.\u2018How lame.\u2019A pro getting excited with the battle of a student. Andrew thought to himself that he was getting old before wiping the sweat off on his pants.Wooooosh!Simon took a step back and leaned out of the way to avoid the club.Even if he could close the distance, the opponent was too tall to pierce Rick\u2019s claymore precisely into the heart or head.\u201cSimon!\u201dAt that moment, Meilyn shouted,\u201cI\u2019ll make a Wall of Ice under your feet! Step on it and thrust your sword at once!! You can do it, right?\u201dGood decision! Simon nodded quickly.The Cyclops, unable to understand the human language, swung its club sideways.Simon kept his knees on the ground without dodging it, and Meilyn\u2019s Wall of Ice rose from the magic circle on the ground.Sliide!The club hit the ice wall. Simon, who had instantly soared 2 meters into the air, stepped on the ice wall and jumped.\u2018It worked.\u2019Time still passed slowly, and he hadn\u2019t lost his concentration yet. The Cyclops\u2019 nape could be seen in front of him.Simon put strength into his arm. The moment when the firm tip of the claymore went straight toward the Cyclops\u2019 neck\u2026Whack!\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dSomeone\u2019s scream split the air. The Cyclops struck Simon with its opposite fist. Simon\u2019s body flew far and crashed into a wall.\u201cSimon!!\u201d\u201cAre you alright? Simon!\u201dA sad voice broke loose from the set position. Simon opened his eyes in excruciating pain.[Barrier Gauge: 7%]But\u2026Time was still slow.Above the punching Cyclops, he saw the claymore, which had slipped out of his fingers, falling in a circular motion.\u2018After all\u2026\u2019Simon raised the corner of his lips and stretched out his arms.\u2018Ending it like this wouldn\u2019t feel like a Necromancer.\u2019A move that he had been saving until the end.Simon gave a restore order.Click Click!Above the shoulder blade of the skeleton that had been pierced between the wounds on Cyclops\u2019 chest, bones on the ground flew like lightning and fit together to form an arm.Clunk!Soon, the skeleton arm grabbed the claymore, which was falling through the air in a circle.And\u2026Pshhk!Without a moment of hesitation, it pierced the Cyclops\u2019 neck.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dA huge silence fell on the dungeon.Simon stood up with his trembling legs.And at the same time\u2026Thuuud!The Cyclops fell to the floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huff! Phew! Haaah!\u201dSimon let out a rough breath and tilted his head arduously.\u2018Finally!\u2019His heart felt so full, and it felt like he was going to go insane. Simon raised his right arm and clenched his bloody fist.\u201cWoooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dThunderous cheers broke loose from everywhere.Hector turned his back, and Jane in the monitor room sat down. Andrew appeared from the air and said while wiping the sweat from his forehead,\u201cGroup 7. Successfully hunted the Cyclops.\u201d\u201cWe did iiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!\u201dThe three people standing in the set position burst into shouts and rushed to Simon.\u201cSimooooooon!\u201dCamibarez, who came to Simon first, hugged Simon with all her might.\u201cWow! Wow! You\u2026 For real?!\u201dShouted Rick in a hoard voice after coming in after her and ruffling Simon\u2019s head.\u201cYou did well! You really did well! Wahahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cWhat a relief! It\u2019s a huge relief!\u201dAs Simon was choking and coughing while smiling, Meilyn, who had left the set position, was approaching Simon.Meilyn had a face containing a lot of emotions passing through her head. After wiping her face once with her hand, she returned to her usual arrogant expression and raised an open hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmph. W-Well done! I guess I owe you for this one.\u201dAs she finished saying that, her voice started trembling. Simon came to her with a smile and gave her a high-five.\u201cYou did well too, Meilyn.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for yeste\u2014\u201dWithout having the time to hear her voice, Rick and Camibarez embraced them both from each side. Once again, everyone burst into cheers and rejoiced.\u201cLet me be serious for once, you idiots!\u201dWhile shouting like that, Meilyn had a smile brighter than ever before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter all the performance assessments for the morning and afternoon teams were finished, everyone in Class A gathered in the Beginner Dark Magic lecture room.\u201cYou did a good job today, everyone.\u201dSaid Jane.\u201cRegardless of the results and scores, I\u2019m satisfied as the professor in charge that all members of Class A carried out an actual battle without any accidents.\u201d\u201cThank you, Professor!\u201dVigorously exclaimed the students while finally freed from the pressure.\u201cBut in Kizen, results are the most important thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJane naturally poured cold water after creating a warm atmosphere. Now that they were all used to her, they waited for her to continue while slightly chuckling.\u201cI\u2019ll start evaluation with Group 1. Please come forward, Group 1.\u201dSimon sat down on his seat and listened to the other group\u2019s evaluations.As expected from Jane, she analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each group and made suggestions for improvements that\u2019d almost give you goosebumps. Her comments were logical and analytical, to the point where people who knew nothing about that certain group were nodding their heads without even realizing it.And\u2026\u201cCarrel Oxara and Yona Kasumi.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cShake hands with each other.\u201d\u2026\u2026What was with the sudden handshake?As the two of them were blinking out of bewilderment, the assistant next to them hinted for the two to do it. The two of them did as they were told.\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin the teamwork like an amateur, but it\u2019d be better to blow off the steam right away if you have problems with each other.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cNext group, please come forward.\u201dJane was also able to see through the relationships and mentality of students. It wasn\u2019t enough to say that her skills were out of the world.Other than that, if there was one thing that Simon thought was unexpected, there were more groups who hunted the Cyclops than he thought.In the first simulation, the proportion of successful groups was slightly over 40%, but in actual battle, 13 out of the 16 groups succeeded in hunting the Cyclops.Even considering the difference in practice time, they were exceedingly strong in actual fights. It was a time when he could feel the potential of Kizen students once again.And in this case, the scores they received were more important than whether or not the Cyclops was hunted.\u201cThe final grade of Group 3 is an A+. Well done.\u201dGroup 3, led by Hector, was overwhelming. Cheers, applause, and gazes of envy were directed at them.\u201cGroup 3 was flawless.\u201dHector\u2019s outstanding fighting power and leadership, the clear roles, and the teamwork between each member. They were also the only ones with 3-minute hunting time. They even had stability, as the barrier gauge exceeded 90%.It was no exaggeration to say that they\u2019re the group that truly represented Class A.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the growth of each one of you. Well done.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dOther than them, Cindy Vivace\u2019s Group 5 was considered a strong team.The hunting time was no worse than Group 3\u2019s, but the fact that it was a team all-in on Cindy Vivace backfired. Scores were greatly reduced in teamwork and stability.And\u2026\u201cGroup 7, please come forward.\u201dFinally, the problematic Group 7 was called out in front of Jane. Group 3 had a high score, but in fact, it was Simon\u2019s Group 7 that became a hot issue.They showed overwhelming performances and thrilled everyone.\u201cGroup 7 was\u2026\u2026\u201dShe rustled and held the scoring sheet. The surroundings became as silent as a grave.\u201cTerrible.\u201dBoom!Simon felt his heart sinking. Meilyn shut her eyes tight, and Camibarez\u2019 lips quivered.\u201cTime spent: 13 minutes and 58 seconds. The barrier gauge of the participating member is also in the single digits at 7%. There were even haphazard and improvised actions that didn\u2019t match the originally planned strategies.\u201dAfter putting down the documents, she looked at Group 7 with expressionless eyes.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey had nothing to say since she presented clear, numerical values.The four were silent, and Jane opened her mouth.\u201cThe grade of Group 7 is a D.\u201dGroups with a grade of less than F were the ones who failed in hunting the Cyclops. It was practically the lowest grade among the groups that hunted the Cyclops.When everyone was about to solemnly go back to their places\u2026\u201cOf course,\u201dThe assistant teacher was handing over new documents to Jane. Jane said, putting it on the top of the scoring sheet,\u201cthat\u2019s if this information wasn\u2019t considered.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe members of Group 7 stopped in their tracks with confused looks.\u201cAfter an autopsy of the corpse of the Cyclops that Group 7 hunted, we found traces that the curse and drugs used at the time of capture caused unusual side effects.\u201dOf course, there was also seriously suspicious information in the autopsy results, but this was classified as a second-degree secret in Kizen.That was the only thing she could tell the students.\u201cThe Cyclops exhibited extreme aggression. As soon as the curse was lifted, it became enraged and its physical abilities were temporarily strengthened. It\u2019s the upper classes\u2019 judgment that the test\u2019s difficulty was significantly different from that of the Cyclopes hunted by other groups.\u201dThe upper classes of Kizen! You could hear the students whispering throughout the lecture room.Jane waved the report bearing the seal of Kizen headquarters to the student and said,\u201cAs a result of comprehensively judging the Cyclops\u2019 aggression, physical strength, and curse resistance, we\u2019ll apply the new scoring rubrics on the premise that Group 7 hunted an upper-rank Cyclops, one with the level of a Red Cyclops. Perhaps that,\u201dJane\u2019s gaze turned to Hector.\u201cwould make it fair, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHector\u2019s expression hardened.If it was the decision of the upper class of Kizen, it wasn\u2019t an issue that students could argue with. Of course, it was also true that all the Class A students had the same question about the Cyclops that Simon faced.Wasn\u2019t Group 7\u2019s Cyclops\u2026 too strong?\u201cI\u2019ll announce the corrected results.\u201dJane read through the document.\u201cMeilyn Villenne.\u201dMeilyn answered while startled,\u201cYes, Professor!\u201d\u201cYou played the key role in protecting the participating member with the jet-black elemental magic that far exceeded the average of 1st-year students of Kizen. You\u2019re given a score of 80.\u201d\u201cWooaah!\u201dCheers broke loose from everywhere.The current highest score was Hector, with 90 out of 100. Considering that she didn\u2019t get the bonus points from being the participating member, scoring 80 was pretty good.Meilyn trembled with effervescence.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a mistake to get injured due to overtraining and poor-self management. However\u2026\u201dJane\u2019s eyes turned to Meilyn\u2019s leg wrapped in bandages.\u201cWorking hard despite your injury was impressive.\u201dMeilyn couldn\u2019t answer right away and her shoulders trembled slightly. She was probably the one who suffered through the most internal struggle.\u201cNext, Rick Hayward.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cUtilizing the high-performance jet-black enchantment in the right time and right place, you played a role as a lubricant of Group 7 in hunting the Cyclops. Likewise, You\u2019re given a score of 80.\u201dA burst of cheers once again. Rick raised his hands and shouted out in joy.\u201cCamibarez Ursula.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\u201cAs an aspiring Hemomancy student, you did a good job as the main attacker of Group 7.\u201dJane smiled.\u201cEven among the Necromancers working in the field, it\u2019s hard to see such a level of excessive bleeding magic. You\u2019re given a score of 85.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dCamibarez\u2019s eyes teared up at the emotion that rushed in like a wave.\u201cCami!\u201d\u201cAs expected!\u201dMeilyn and Rick hugged her and repeatedly said, \u201cGood job!\u201d\u201cLastly, Simon Polentia.\u201dSilence instantly fell in the lecture room.Hector, anxiously watching Group 7 performing well, turned pale and he slipped slightly off his chair.\u201cYou did your part as a participating member. You took care of the team members despite the unexpected variables and made time by avoiding the attacks of the Cyclops by yourself. You\u2019ve accomplished the prerequisite for Hemorrhage by injuring the monster\u2019s body with your dramatic operation of the summons, and the use of the Restoration skill was impressive. In the end, you finished the Cyclops off too.\u201dAfter reading the scoring sheet, she exhaled lightly and opened her mouth.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026It was perfect. You\u2019re given a score of 100 for the personal score.\u201dA score of 100! An explosive cheer shook the lecture room.The other students in Class A had no choice but to acknowledge Simon\u2019s achievement. Group 7\u2019s performance was an excellent stimulus for everyone to that extent.And just like that, the total evaluation grade of the Group 7 was an A+, the highest grade. The score went up a few steps and stood shoulder to shoulder with the score of Group 3, the strongest group in Class A.And,\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that there\u2019s no grade higher than A+.\u201dBy Jane saying that, she hinted that the best in class A was Group 7, driving the wedge in.Hector closed his eyes and leaned deep into the backrest.\u201cHector\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up before I rip your mouth open.\u201dThe members of Group 3 had no choice but to keep their mouths shut and tread carefully because of Hector.* * *\u201cCheers for an A+!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dBeer glasses clinked, and loud laughter broke loose. With the setting night sky in the background, a bonfire burned in front of a small hut.Simon, Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez were sitting in a circle around it, and in front of the bonfire, delicious grilled skewers were dripping oil, cooking well.\u201cPwhaaa. The performance assessment this time was carried by me, Rick!!\u201dSaid Rick while red-faced and chuckling.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t have even hurt the Cyclops! Right? Don\u2019t y\u2019all agree on this one?\u201d\u201cOh here we go. You\u2019re being cocky again.\u201dMeilyn rolled her eyes and scolded him. Still, with a smile on her lips, she didn\u2019t have that usual edge in her voice.\u201cSimply, we would\u2019ve lost if even a single person couldn\u2019t do their part, you dumbass. And to tell the truth, you were the one with the least to do! All you did was drop some weapons!\u201d\u201cWow! I\u2019m so dumbfounded! Is it really okay to condemn the one who carried like this?\u201d\u201cAh, get away from me! You smell like liquor!\u201d\u201cEh? For real? I\u2019ve just finished drinking a glass, though.\u201dRick took a breath in the palm of his hand and sniffed it. Meilyn shook her head, disgusted.On the other hand, Camibarez was looking down on the glass of beer in her hands with a very serious expression.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drink it if you don\u2019t like it.\u201dSaid Simon as he laughed.\u201cN-No! It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026! It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a little nervous because this is my first time drinking\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Cami! It\u2019s fine!\u201dRick waved his hand.\u201cAs long as you can take responsibility for your actions, anything is okay for students of Kizen! Besides, it\u2019s not just us who came to this place, but we also have a \u2018guardian\u2019, right? It\u2019s a legal drinking party! A legal drinking party!\u201dLooking at Rick being upbeat, Camibarez cautiously asked Simon,\u201cIf I drink this, will I become like Rick too?\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t stand it in the end, bursting into laughter.Meilyn, on the opposite side, was shrieking with laughter. Rick looked like he was about to cry.\u201cEt tu, Cami\u2026\u2026\u201dJust as Rick was livening up the mood with his odd pronunciation, someone appeared from the hut.\u201cCome on, eat this one too!\u201dIt was none other than Combat Magic Professor Hong Feng. She placed the pot on a support in front of the bonfire. The steaming pot contained meat soup.\u201cWooaaah!\u201dEveryone was excited by the delicious smell and flocked to the front of the pot. Hong Feng offered each disciple a bowl of soup by herself.\u201cThank you for the food!\u201dIt was Hong Feng who invited everyone to the hut. Hearing that Simon had received the highest grade this time, she invited Simon\u2019s groupmates to a celebration party. The grilled skewers and meat soup were made from prey she hunted herself.Simon ate a spoonful of soup.\u2018\u2026\u2026I-It\u2019s so delicious!\u2019He\u2019d never tried something like this. It was just delicious, enough to make your jaw drop. It had a mild and natural taste without any spices, but it was surprising how it could come out with such a deep flavor.\u201cAwesome!\u201d\u201cProfessor, you\u2019re the best!\u201d\u201cFufu! Eat as much as you want!\u201dHong Feng also sat down.It was originally hard to dream of having this kind of a drinking party among students in Kizen, but they were able to spend this kind of time thanks to the fact that she provided a place and that she took responsibility as a guardian.Rick quickly poured a beer out from the oak barrel and handed it to her.\u201cThank you, Rick.\u201d\u201cWahah! I never expected to see myself being invited somewhere by a professor of Kizen! As expected\u2026!\u201dRick looked at Simon with sly eyes.\u201cProfessor Hong Feng, don\u2019t you show some favoritism toward Simon\u2026\u2026?\u201dMeilyn, who was eating the soup, raised her head in a flash.\u201cHey! Rick!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dSaid Hong Feng as she smiled softly. Everyone stopped and looked at her.\u201cWe\u2019re all people. Wouldn\u2019t we likely have students we like and students we don\u2019t?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ahaha! Now that you mention it, you\u2019re right! Cheers!\u201dRick quickly shouted for a toast.Simon, feeling somewhat embarrassed, clinked the glass while blushing. Hong Feng laughed.\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m proud of all my students, and I love them!\u201dHong Feng tenderly stroked Simon\u2019s head while saying that.Rick and Meilyn\u2019s envious gazes fell on Simon. Camibarez looked at Simon and Hong Feng in turn, then quickly lowered her head.\u201cIt must be tough these days now that the student protection period is over, but the Kizen professors aren\u2019t doing things because they hate you. Hang in there just a little bit longer! Okay?\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dYou couldn\u2019t find anything like the authority of a Kizen\u2019s professor with Hong Feng on a private occasion. The way she treated them with infinite kindness and comfort felt like a neighborly older sister.Thanks to that, everyone was able to quickly adapt to the atmosphere of the drinking party.\u201cNext week\u2026\u201dSaid Hong Fend in the heated atmosphere, stretching her legs.Rick said, while pretending to be listening closely,\u201cYes, professor? We\u2019re listening!\u201d\u201cNext week, you\u2019ll finally be on a \u2018mission\u2019.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMissions.One of the core elements of Kizen\u2019s unique system.After the student protection period was over, Kizen\u2019s students were given a time called the \u2018mission period\u2019.It lasted around two or three days, including weekends, so around five days were designated as the mission period, and in this time, students could perform various missions commissioned from outside.From simple chores and part-time jobs to monster elimination, body guarding, assassination of key figures, and even proxy wars.There were various kinds of missions. Even the missions performed by active Necromancers were released to Kizen students.Depending on the difficulty and success or failure of the mission received, \u2018Evaluation Points\u2019 were given, and the commission fee could be formally received. It was also the fastest way for Kizen students to earn money, as they lacked funds due to the huge material costs.And, as Hong Feng mentioned last night, Kizen set the next five days, including the weekend, as the mission period.\u201cAll students have different strategies for the missions.\u201dAt lunchtime, Rick was laying out the information in the cafeteria.\u201cYou need to complete at least one mission during this period, you see? There are people who just clear simple missions on Roke Island and study hard for the rest of the time to raise their grades, while there are people who ride the teleportation circle and go out of the island to accomplish a big mission and earn both money and mission points.\u201cMm.\u201dSimon took a sip of his soft drink and nodded.\u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t get to clear the mission within those five days?\u201d\u201cOf course, the mission will be a failure. It does nothing for both your score and wealth.\u201dRick shrugged his shoulders and continued.\u201cIn special cases, you can write a letter of explanation and continue on your mission, but in the end, it\u2019s your loss since you\u2019ll miss all the classes you could\u2019ve taken.\u201d\u201cSo there\u2019s a risk, huh?\u201dRick nodded with a serious face.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to grab one that can be accomplished within Rochest, benefit from it, and focus on the expansion of business.\u201d[For us, there\u2019s nothing to be concerned about!]Pier\u2019s clone hanging on Simon\u2019s school uniform spoke to him. Of course, only Simon could hear his voice.[We\u2019re departing to the continent using the mission as an excuse! It\u2019s urgent to gather the forces of the Legion scattered across the continent and restore our former prestige!]Simon felt the same way.If the ancient undeads under his father\u2019s control were scattered somewhere on the continent, he had to obtain them.After all, it was the biggest power-up that Simon could try.\u2018By the way, are there stronger undeads than you, Pier?\u2019Pier\u2019s clone grinned.[Kuhehe! I\u2019m a Marshall of the Legion! No one dares go against me. But in terms of combat ability, there are some real monsters among the ones who served as captains under the Legion.]\u2018Captains under the Legion?\u2019It was the first time Simon had heard of this.[The Legion was originally divided into several undead units, and the ancient undead with intelligence commanded their forces! If all the captains and the undead they led were united, it wouldn\u2019t be too long before the Legion regained its former prestige!]To think that he could have new ancient undead besides Pier!!Simon\u2019s eyes twinkled. He felt that he should definitely do this.\u2018But how do we know where the captains are?\u2019[Kuhehe! There\u2019s no way those crazy bastards are living quietly without trouble. They must be causing some troubles all over the continent. And there\u2019s a high chance it would be in Kizen\u2019s missions!]`We should definitely check them out, even with a trivial clue.\u2019\u201cSimon.\u201dRick was looking at Simon with a puzzled look while Simon was too absorbed in talking to Pier.\u201cWhy are you suddenly laughing to yourself?\u201d\u201cH-Huh? Ahaha! No, I suddenly had a funny thought\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon quickly laughed it off.\u201cAnyway, filling up with easy missions is also problematic.\u201dSaid Rick, waving his fork.\u201cThe mission grade is at stake. If you keep on doing easy tasks and procrastinate it more and more, you may have to take on a dangerous task later, such as the assassination of a key person.\u201d\u201cSo procrastination isn\u2019t a good idea. I see.\u201d\u201cYeap.\u201dSimon felt his determination resolve itself even further.* * *The next morning.Mission bulletin boards were installed throughout key facilities, including the male and female dormitories in Kizen. Students were flocking in front of the bulletin boards.\u201cAnyone wants to get rid of werewolves on Roke Island? It\u2019s a party of three!\u201d\u201cA Langerstine mission on a blue request form! These things are easy peasy.\u201d\u201cThe commission fee for Langerstine is too cheap. Might as well go further if you\u2019re going out.\u201dWhite \u2013 Within Roke Island. No possibility of encountering a Priest.Blue \u2013 Within the Dark Alliance. Very low possibility of encountering a Priest.Red \u2013 Within the Neutral Area. High possibility of encountering a Priest.Black \u2013 Within the Holy Federation. Will encounter a Priest.Naturally, the more dangerous the mission, the higher the commission fee and mission score. Even within the blue request forms, the commission fee varied greatly depending on the content of the mission.As he was watching, the white request forms started to disappear.First-year students were still in the stage of adjusting to Kizen, and there was a strong tendency to focus more on school life than on tasks. The mentality of avoiding difficult things on the first mission also applied.Of course, Simon had a different thought.\u2018There\u2019s no way my father\u2019s other undeads would be on Roke Island.\u2019Simon immediately skipped the white request forms and looked at the bulletin board with the blue ones.The blue request forms were also popular because they were close and easier on the mind. Students who had some greed for wealth while wanting a moderately safe mission chose this one.\u2018Pier.\u2019[Mm. I\u2019m looking.]Pier\u2019s clone attached to Simon\u2019s school uniform was looking around diligently.[There\u2019s nothing specific that catches my attention.]\u2018Then, I\u2019ll move on to the next one.\u2019Simon took a step forward and headed to the bulletin board with the red request forms. From here on, the number of students viewing had drastically decreased.As Simon tried to get closer to see the small text, he accidentally bumped into the shoulder of someone next to him.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sor\u2014\u201dA male student with a huge physique.It was none other than Hector.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After confirming who the opponent was, Simon jumped back. He also knew that Hector didn\u2019t really like him.\u201cSimon Polentia.\u201dHector opened his mouth.\u201cSo you\u2019re also planning to go to the Neutral Area, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m just taking a look.\u201dHector scoffed.\u201cThe Neutral area is a lawless zone outside of Kizen\u2019s influence. Even if you get into trouble or die while you\u2019re on your mission there, there\u2019s no way that Kizen could find it out.\u201dA deep smile formed on his face.\u201cI really hope we\u2019ll encounter each other on the mission.\u201dHector tore off one of the red request forms on the bulletin board and strode away.\u201cHector.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dSimon smiled as Hector turned around.\u201cBe careful out there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dFor a moment, a horrible frown appeared on Hector\u2019s face. Thick veins stood out on his neck and his knuckles turned white.Simon straightened his shoulders and met his gaze with a calm face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA brief war of nerves ensued.Eventually, Hector whipped around and stormed up the stairs. Simon turned his head too and looked at the bulletin board.[Hehehehe! What\u2019s wrong with that kid?]\u2018I don\u2019t know either.\u2019Simon couldn\u2019t figure out why Hector hated him, no matter how much he thought about it.\u2018Is it because I embarrassed him in the first Summoning class? But I was embarrassed in the first Curses class, so that should make it even.\u2019\u2018That fight in the public bath? But it was covered up before the real fight even took place because of Kajann\u2019s intrusion.\u2019Simon couldn\u2019t explain it, no matter how hard he thought about it, so he forgot about Hector and concentrated on the red request forms again.\u2018Pier, what about this one? A swarm of infected zombies attacked the village.\u2019[Infection is too common.]\u2018Then what about this? Damage to buildings and crops due to an attack by a swarm of red snakes that suddenly appeared.\u2019[It\u2019s interesting. However, there\u2019s no one with that kind of ability among the captains.]It was then when Simon and Pier were meticulously looking at the request forms.\u2018Why is this here?\u2019In the corner of the request forms that were attached to the bulletin board in clusters, there was one that stood out in particular.Because it was a blue request form attached to a board for red ones.\u2018Is it some kind of mistake?\u2019The moment Simon approached to look at the request form, someone took it away.\u201cOh, so this was still here. Please ignore this.\u201dIt was the servant who managed the mission bulletin board. Simon quickly asked,\u201cWhat kind of mission is that?\u2019\u201cAh, this is a mission from several months ago\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a mission where the Necromancer subcontracted by Kizen went missing.\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened. Not even a student, but a Necromancer went missing?\u201cCan I take a look too?\u201d\u201cWhat? B-But this isn\u2019t a mission that a student can do\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease?\u201dThe manager presented the request form with an uneasy face. Simon and Pier quickly looked at the request form.Request: Resolution of disappearance caseRequest Rank: D -> BRequest Reward: 50 gold.Location: Territory of Arnish.Details: Young women were found desiccated.Special note: Mission recipient missing.Simon was surprised to see the picture enclosed in the request form. Women were really dried up like raisins.[Found it!]The side of Pier\u2019s mouth tore open.[This trace is her! Elizabeth!]\u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019[An ancient undead leading the spider troops. When Elizabeth or the spiders she leads suck up a human body\u2019s fluids, they turn like this. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s her!]Simon carefully put the request form in his pocket.Perhaps because of its high rank, the reward was a whopping 50 gold.\u201c\u2026\u2026Mister, are you really going to do that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI doubt the professor in charge will allow you.\u201dSimon smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll try to persuade them.\u201d* * *Anyone could freely take a white mission, but from the red forms up or missions with a rank of B or higher, you had to go through counseling with the professor in charge.\u201cProfessor Jane, it\u2019s me, Simon Polentia.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dJane\u2019s voice was heard through the door. Simon caustiously went inside.There was a bookcase packed so tightly that you couldn\u2019t see the empty space on the wall, and every corner contained boxes holding towers of countless documents.Still, it was overall a well-organized room. The only messy part was the documents cluttering her desk.Simon knew that those were something she had to deal with today.\u201cDid you come here for a mission?\u201dJane, who was looking through the documents, was wearing glasses with her hair up, unlike usual. As she asked her question, her eyes were still fixed on the papers, and the quill in her hand was moving with tremendous speed.\u201cYes, Professor!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201dSimon approached her at a quiet pace to not disturb her and carefully placed the request form on the edge of the desk.Jane scanned the request form once by moving only her eyes before writing out her papers again.\u2018D-Did she check it?\u2019As Simon was hesitatingly standing still, she opened her mouth.\u201cPlease change to another request. It\u2019s not something a freshman could do.\u201dLooks like she saw it right.Simon gulped and said,\u201cI\u2019m confident, Professor. I really want to take on this request and accomplish it.\u201dHer quill stopped. He could feel Jane\u2019s eyes behind her glasses piercing through him.Simon\u2019s back stiffened as he was filled with some strange tension.\u201cYou\u2019re confident?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m confident.\u201dAnd as soon as Simon said that, Jane picked up the quill and signed the request form.\u201cYou may leave now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026O-Okay?\u201dSimon felt the countless excuses he had prepared in his head become useless.She\u2019s really allowing me, just like this?\u201cThere must be a reason for you to say that you\u2019re confident in front of a Kizen professor. You don\u2019t have to convince me. You\u2019re Kizen. You only have to take responsibility for the results.\u201dHer gaze turned frightening.\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t tricking me, Simon Polentia.\u201dSimon\u2019s expression hardened as he received her gaze head on, but he didn\u2019t falter any further. Simon bowed his head.\u201cThank you for trusting me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer quill stopped for a moment, but soon resumed.\u201cPlease be safe out there.\u201dIt sounded like a throwaway line, but Simon felt as though her voice was somehow warm.* * *Simon was really busy as soon as he got back to the dormitory.\u201cRick! I\u2019m planning to go down to Rochest for a while. Is there a safe route?\u201d\u201cHuh? Today?\u201dSimon went down to Rochest through the route he had heard of from Rick.There he bought some equipment, as well as a robe and clothes for an adventurer to hide their identity.Then he went straight to the Forbidden Forest and stopped at Pier\u2019s ruins.\u201cPier! Isn\u2019t this perfect?\u201dWhat Simon gladly offered was plate armor that could\u2019ve been found inside a medieval castle.Pier\u2019s expression turned sour.[You\u2019re not telling me to get inside that armor, are you?]\u201cYou said you wanted to stick around me during the mission, didn\u2019t you? You can\u2019t roam around looking like that.\u201d[\u2026\u2026Tsk.]Eventually, Pier went inside the armor. It was more appropriate to say that he went in it than to say he wore it.After a while, the armor started to rattle unnaturally and move.[\u2026\u2026Are you really telling me to move around like this?]\u201cLooks good on you, Pier!\u201dSimon clapped his hands with a wide smile. Pier shuddered and looked back.[Dammit! I told you not to laugh like Anna!]\u201cHahaha!\u201dAfter putting the conscripted skeletons into the subspace, Simon returned to Kizen.When he entered the dorm room, Rick was asleep and Kajann was nowhere to be seen.Simon packed his things and prepared for the trip. He was leaving for the mission through teleportation early tomorrow morning.\u2018It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been outside Roke Island.\u2019Simon closed his eyes, excited.* * *The dawn of the next day.Simon packed his things and moved to the location that he was informed of. A long-distance teleportation device was installed on the hill behind Kizen, and many students were already waiting for their turn.\u201cSimon!\u201dTurning around after hearing his name, he saw Meilyn running toward him while waving. She seemed to be using the teleportation device too.\u201cHey Meilyn.\u201d\u201cHi! By the way, are you seriously going to take that mission?\u201dMeilyn folded her arms with a frown.\u201cI told you it\u2019s difficult to complete an investigation mission in 5 days. Don\u2019t tell me that I didn\u2019t tell you to get something easier, okay?\u201dSimon replied, smiling,\u201cThank you for worrying about me.\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing like that!\u201dShe let out a shriek. Simon laughed it off and asked,\u201cHow about you? Where are you going?\u201d\u201cA merchant escort mission going up near Langerstine.\u201dShe laughed boastfully.\u201cIsn\u2019t it great? It\u2019s a carriage trip that starts from Langerstine.\u201d\u201cStill, be careful. If you ever run into a band of thieves\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPfft. You think it\u2019s still like the old days? And even if thieves come\u2026\u2026\u201dShe took off a bit of the adventurer\u2019s robe she was wearing.Underneath was a black jacket, a white shirt, and a skirt. Kizen\u2019s female school uniform.\u201cI just have to tell them to get lost after showing them this. Even a bunch of stupid bandits would know what happens if they lay a hand on Kizen.\u201dSimon feigned a smile.When he faced the gangs in Langerstine the day before school, he remembered that they all lost their will to fight the moment Lorain revealed the name of Kizen.\u201c\u2026\u2026That kinda feels like cheating.\u201d\u201cThe merchants request Kizen students for this purpose too.\u201dAt that moment, the teleporter managers started calling the students by name. Meilyn waved her hand when she heard her name.\u201cWell then, bye! See you next week.\u201d\u201cYeah, take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cWorry about yourself more. The place you\u2019re going, Kallos, is at the forefront of the Dark Alliance.\u201dAfter leaving those words, Meilyn ran off.There seemed to be quite a few students moving to Langerstine. A lot of students were clustering on the teleportation device. Langerstine was a popular destination because it was close to Kizen, and because you could also hang around after the mission was over.After a while, Meilyn and the students were teleported, and the manager called the names of Simon and several other students. Simon walked toward them.\u201cPlease present your ID and request form.\u201dThe manager politely bowed their head. Simon presented the student ID from Kizen and the request form signed by Jane.\u201cTo the Arnish territory in the Kallos Kingdom. Is this correct?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cPlease sign here.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dUpon receiving the document with Simon\u2019s signature, the manager smiled brightly and stepped aside.\u201cConfirmed. You may go up now.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSimon got up onto the teleporter. Then, he saw a student who had gotten there first.\u201cAh.\u201dIt was a familiar face.She even took the oath as the student representative. At that time, Simon was the male representative, and she was the female representative.With her beautiful, ivory hair fluttering away, she was putting on a white coat over her Kizen school uniform and was using her neat-looking parasol gracefully.She also curtsied and greeted Simon when their eyes met.\u201cWe ran to each other again.\u201dThe official successor of the Ivory Tower, Special Admission No. 2 Serene Aindark.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Somehow, there was a tension forming, not because of her background, but because of a foreign energy flowing from her.\u2018\u2026\u2026It\u2019s suffocating.\u2019Among the many students of Kizen, Lorain was the only other one with such a unique aura.Lorain had a strong feeling of coerciveness and roughness, but in the case of Serene, you could feel a far higher class of dignity.The monarch\u2019s dignity that humbles and embarrasses their opponents while showing them up. It made him wonder if she was really the same age as him.Then, her mouth opened.\u201cI heard that our Meilyn is being taken care of.\u201dShe knew that Simon and Meilyn were in the same class and group.\u201cShe\u2019s a little bit of a whiner, but she\u2019s kind and tender on the inside. Please take good care of her.\u201dSimon took a slow, deep breath. Little by little, the trembling, the tension in his body, and the trivial thoughts in his head all flew away.Finally, a relaxed smile appeared on Simon\u2019s lips.\u201cWhy are you telling me that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cMeilyn isn\u2019t a person under your protection. She\u2019s a freshman at Kizen, just like you.\u201dSimon noticed the meaning in her words and intonation.Serene was treating Meilyn as someone naturally inferior to her.And that fact\u2026 was very much irritating Simon.\u201cMeilyn is doing well without you needing to worry about her.\u201dA deep smile appeared on Serene\u2019s lips.\u201cI see.\u201dIt was the first time he had drained his mental strength like this by just talking to someone.Simon turned his head, not wanting to deal with her anymore, but Serene looked at Simon while blinking her jade-colored eyes. Drops of sweat started to appear on Simon\u2019s brow.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll activate the device!\u201dThankfully, the manager picked the right time to say they were operating the device.Wooooooosh!The teleportation device activated, and a dazzling light engulfed Simon and Serene\u2019s bodies.Serene said with a smile,\u201cSee you again next time.\u201dI don\u2019t want to see you again!With that thought in mind, Simon completely entrusted himself to the sensations floating in his legs.* * *In the office of the castle lord from the Kallos Kingdom\u2019s territory of Arnish and an area under the domain of the Dark Alliance,\u201c\u2026\u2026It happened again?\u201dA middle-aged man with a long brown beard was sighing with a grimace.He was Count Raymond, the person in charge of Arnish.\u201cYes sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe guard captain bowed his head with a hardened face. Next to him was a corpse on a stretcher, covered with a white cloth. Its face was hidden by the cloth, but its droopy hands were twisted and dried up like a mummy\u2019s.\u201cThese incidents are happening more and more frequently. This is already the third case this month!\u201dThe Count hit the table. He then undid his shirt collar and let out a sigh.\u201cI can\u2019t live with this feeling of anxiety anymore! What about the mercenaries we hired from outside?\u201d\u201cThey are still on the search, but even after scouring the territory, there was nothing\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Count frowned.\u201cEating up the money without being able to work properly! Send them back too!\u201d\u201cYes sir! And I\u2019m sorry to ask, but was there any news from Kizen\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still no news from Kizen.\u201dThe Count ground his teeth.It had been three months since he placed the request. The number of victims continued to increase due to the unknown situation, but there has been no response from Kizen.The guard captain bowed his head.\u201cAfter all, maybe we should put this as a formal request to the HQ of Kizen instead of as a general reque\u2014\u201d\u201cYou want to call a Necromancer from HQ? Do you want to blow the entire budget of our territory on a commission fee?\u201d\u201cI-I misspoke!\u201dThe Count spoke while leaning deeply into his chair.\u201cYou may leave now.\u201d\u201cYes sir. Rest well, sir!\u201dThe guard captain and the guards took the corpse and left the room. The Count sighed and filled an empty glass with wine.\u201cWould you like a glass?\u201dSaid the Count, raising his glass. Then, he heard someone\u2019s voice from behind the curtain.\u201cThank you for your offer, but I\u2019ll decline as I\u2019m still in training.\u201dThe curtain lifted, revealing someone sitting in a chair.She was dressed in a robe, her hood was pressed far down, and you could see whitish hair visible under the hood.The Count drank the wine at once.\u201cI apologize for calling a special guest like you all the way here, but as you can see, the situation is quite urgent.\u201dThe Crown Prince was scheduled to visit the territory just next month.It\u2019d be bothersome to have a shady thing happening at such an important time. The Count\u2019s eyes gleamed.\u201cAre you really sure that you can solve it?\u201dThe person sitting on the chair slowly got up. As the wand in her hand pushed up the end of her hood, her plentiful hair flew down, revealing the face of a young girl.\u201cDo you not trust in the Efnel?\u201dThe Count flinched.\u201cTh-That\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Count. It\u2019s the will of the great Goddess to save the people of the continent from the evil acts of the undead.\u201dA bright smile formed on her lips.\u201cOn the honor of His Holiness, I, Ellen Zile, a 2nd-year student at Divine University Efnel, will surely solve the case.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Simon could feel some kind of strange affection for it.\u2018I love this kind of neighborhood more than a big city after all.\u2019[It\u2019s! So! Suffocating! Dammit!]At that moment, Pier, who was inside the armor, coughed out a complaint. You could hear the rattling sound of metal clashing as he moved.\u201cHang in there just a little, Pier.\u201d[Buy a bigger one next time! This size isn\u2019t right after all!]\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that.\u201dTo say that the size was small when he didn\u2019t even have the flesh. Simon thought that Pier was being such a baby, but he just laughed it off.The two walked around the streets, talking about different things.Perhaps the street wasn\u2019t so lively due to the recent uneasy happenings. Doors were firmly shut in every house, and curtains were drawn on the windows. It felt like everyone was sparing themselves.\u201cMm. We\u2019re at a loss. How do we find the undead here?\u201d[Kuhehe! I did a lot of missions like this while I was traveling with Richard. There are three main methods.]Pier raised his fingers with the stiff gauntlet, making it creak.[The first is to meet the client. Since it was mentioned that the client is a lord, reveal that you\u2019re from Kizen and ask for all the information they have so far! Perhaps we can also get some financial or physical support!]\u201cOh, that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d[But if the client hasn\u2019t been able to solve this problem till now, there\u2019s always a reason for that around them!]Simon could understand the meaning behind Pier\u2019s words. He was saying that, if you contacted the client, there\u2019d be a factor of that variable intervening.[The second is an investigation by questioning. Borrowing Richard\u2019s words, it\u2019s basically legwork!]\u201cMmm. That\u2019s a bit\u2026\u2026\u201d[But in my experience, surprisingly, there have been times when this was the quickest shortcut to the truth. And lastly!]Pier raised a third finger.[Buying information from the Thieves Guild.]\u201cThe Thieves Guild?\u201d[Are they called differently these days? Think of it as an information guild. There are always informants in a city of decent size who buy and sell information. No one is as sensitive to issues as them!]\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter hearing Pier\u2019s advice, Simon closed his eyes for a moment and pondered.\u201cAlright. Then let\u2019s find a place to stay first and find the Thieves Guild.\u201d[That\u2019s great news! I want to take this fucking armor off already!]Simon and Pier wandered the streets around the square. Because of the rough terrain, the number of inns was small when compared to the size of the city.However, they managed to find an inn by asking around.\u201cWelcome!\u201dAs soon as Simon opened the door, the innkeeper greeted them. He was a man in his mid-40s who looked like a native of this region that knew a lot about this place.\u201cOne large and clean room, please.\u201d\u201cSure, got it! It\u2019s gonna be 300 silver per night. Do you need a meal too? If you eat wheat bread and soup, it\u2019s gonna be 50 silver, and a meat dish is an extra 150 silver.\u201d\u2018Inns are quite pricey. Must be because there aren\u2019t many inns around, huh?\u2019With that thought in mind, Simon searched through his pockets, pulled out 1 gold coin, and flicked it with his finger.\u201cWheat bread is enough for our breakfast tomorrow.\u201dThe innkeeper grabbed the coin with wide eyes. It was 1,000 silver per gold coin.\u201cShall I provide you with the change?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. But instead, I\u2019m curious about the location of the Thieves Guild.\u201dThe innkeeper\u2019s expression changed strangely.\u201cA-Aha! So you want to buy some information. You seem to be an outsider. How did you get h\u2014\u201dSimon slowly raised an open hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re randomly asking for the identity of the customer. I think I should receive 1 gold for that information.\u201dGiggles!Standing next to Simon, Pier laughed out loud while twisting his sides.[A little kid who\u2019s still wet behind the ears is playing around with an old man!]The innkeeper\u2019s face froze.He could tell. The gold wasn\u2019t the problem. He had an uneasy feeling that his head would go flying if he returned the 1 gold and asked for his identity.What were these outsiders?The innkeeper put the coin in his pocket with that thought in mind.\u201cS-So you\u2019re curious about the location of Thieves Guild, right?\u201dTing!Simon flicked his finger again. Another gold coin flew into the innkeeper\u2019s hand.\u201cAnd all the information you have about the \u2018disappearance case\u2019 too.\u201dSimon shone his penetrating eyes.\u201cYou seem to know something. Am I right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe innkeeper gulped with an obviously nervous face. Simon felt like he could hear him putting his brain to work.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll return the 1 gold.\u201dThe moment the innkeeper was about to approach Simon\u2026Shing!Before he knew it, a pure-white greatsword was aimed at his neck.His face turned pale, and you could hear a dark laugh sounding from the helm of the armored man pointing the greatsword.It was a terrible laugh that couldn\u2019t exist in reality.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dSimon still held out his palm and smiled kindly.\u201cWeren\u2019t you gonna return it?\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026K-Kugh!\u2019After shaking for a moment, the innkeeper fell to the floor.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I\u2019ll do as you say. In return, please keep the fact that I was the one who provided the information\u2026\u2026 a secret.\u201dSimon nodded at Pier. Pier retrieved his greatsword and carried it on his shoulder.\u201cPlease stand up. I\u2019ll do that.\u201dThe time allotted for solving the case was only 5 days. There wasn\u2019t much time for measured approaches to different things.Simon and Pier decided to go tough for this mission.Simon heard everything from the innkeeper. He was able to check all the detailed information about the disappearances so far.\u201cAfter the disappearance of the people of the territory, a skinny mummy is found a few months later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThe victims of the disappearances are mostly young men, but the ones found as mummies are mostly women.\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s right.\u201dSimon put on an agonized look. There wasn\u2019t enough evidence to get the hang of the situation.\u201cFor the female victims\u2026 Uhm\u2026\u2026 Was there by any chance traces of abuse?\u201d\u201cThe lord also suspected that the gangs in the territory were committing sexual assaults, but he said that there were no such traces.\u201dSimon\u2019s head started to hurt more and more, but Pier, who was listening next to Simon with his arms folded, was giggling over and over, making Simon think about what was making him so happy.\u201c\u2026\u2026Pier?\u201d[Heheheheh! I\u2019m sure! I\u2019m sure of it!]Pier smirked.[Elizabeth. She must be somewhere in this city! It\u2019s certain! To think that we found her this easily! Kuhahahaha!]Pier certainly seemed to get the hang of it. Then there was no reason for us to be here any longer. Simon stood from his seat.\u201cWe\u2019ll come back in the evening.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Please be careful out there. The territory is unsettled these days.\u201dSimon and Pier came out. The next destination was the Thieves\u2019 Guild, which they knew from the innkeeper.\u201cPier. How can you be sure that this case is the work of that ancient undead?\u201d[That\u2019s obvious!]Pier grinned.[Toying with young men and draining up and killing the women since she doesn\u2019t really care about them! It\u2019s exactly what that devil of a woman would do!]\u201c\u2026\u2026An undead does that? Isn\u2019t she human?\u201d[Didn\u2019t I tell you? Undead are beings that can\u2019t be understood by a human\u2019s common sense! The ancient undead, who have lived for a long time, are even more eccentric!]\u201cMm.\u201dSimon rested his chin and pondered.[What are you thinking so hard about?]\u201cWell, I\u2019m also a young man, you see. Why don\u2019t I use myself as bait to pull that devil of a woman out?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Pier burst out laughing through the helm.[What is this kid who\u2019s still wet behind the ears blabbering about?! Hahahaha!]Pier ruffled Simon\u2019s hair with his palm. Simon pouted his lips.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is there something wrong with me?\u201d[What I\u2019m telling you is that you\u2019re too far from her taste! The chances are still small, even if you put on a beard.]\u201cUgh.\u201dAfter talking about different things, the two finally arrived in front of the Thieves Guild. At first glance, it looked like an ordinary pub.The two opened the door and went inside.A bar-style pub. A handsome middle-aged bartender was wiping the glasses, and the bearded men occupying the table were drenched in alcohol. Unlike the empty streets, this place was crawling with people.\u2018But the atmosphere of selling information is nowhere to be found. It just looks like a local pub.\u2019Simon and Pier sat down at the bar\u2019s side.\u201cWhat can I give you?\u201dSimon stretched out his finger at the bartender\u2019s question and drew a T in the air before holding out a silver coin.\u201cPlease, this way.\u201d\u2018Ah, it really worked!\u2019It was easy when just following what the innkeeper had told them.Simon and Pier followed the bartender\u2019s guidance. As they exited the store\u2019s back door, he saw a door and a staircase leading to the basement. The bartender bowed his head politely and went back right away.\u201cPhew.\u201dSimon took a deep breath and went down the stairs. The sound of the stone floor resonating was particularly loud, and the moldy smell of the basement stung the nose.As he went down the stairs, two men wearing masks carrying crossbows stood in front of the door. Without saying a word, they stepped aside and opened the door.Creeeaaak.The door opened with the sound of an old hinge.The atmosphere here was quite different from upstairs. People with robes drawn over their faces or masks sat quietly at the tables.Three middle-aged men were sitting face to face playing poker, two young men glanced up, and an elderly man and a young woman were drinking beer alone.Behind the bar, there were several doors that seemed to be places to purchase the information. For now, Simon and Pier sat down at a table in a quiet corner against the wall.\u201cWelcome.\u201dA young hostess approached the two.She was dressed in a tight, wine-colored dress clinging to her body, and her voluminous blonde hair was tangled into bubbles.Tap. Tap.A black band was worn on her white legs that could be seen through her dress, and beside the band, you could see blades secretly shining.Simon gulped.\u201cWell, then,\u201dSitting in the chair opposite to them, she said with a business smile,\u201cwhat brings you to our Guild, dear outsiders?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Pretty obvious.\u201d\u201cWe came to buy some information.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of information do you want?\u201d\u201cAbout people who\u2019re missing from the territory and dead bodies that have dried up like mummies. Everything you know about this case.\u201dThe hostess smiled.\u201cEverything? It\u2019s going to be very costly. Can a first-year from Kizen really afford it?\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026!!\u2019Simon was flabbergasted inside, but asked back expressionlessly,\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple deduction.\u201dShe continued to speak in a relaxed tone.Everyone knows that the lord is desperate to solve this case. In fact, he has commissioned the case to many kinds of people, and there\u2019s no way that Kizen\u2019s not part of them. However, a small territory like this wouldn\u2019t be able to call the Necromancers of Kizen\u2019s HQ, so he would\u2019ve chosen to place a request on the students.\u201dHer body leaned towards Simon. One knee came up on the chair, and the scent of dense roses wafted through her. A narrow curve could be seen behind her smiling face.\u201cAnd at this time, there are only first-year students in Kizen. The students who received the mission are first-year students whose student protection period has been lifted. And a young-looking outsider\u2026\u2026\u201dShe removed Simon\u2019s hood with a furtive hand.\u201cappeared in our territory in good time.\u201dShe lifted Simon\u2019s chin with her fingertips and smiled.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\u2026\u2026How disrespectful.But he shouldn\u2019t be so obvious. It was just a matter of offering the information that he came from Kizen to the information guild.\u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t have enough money, you could also reveal your identity. Get us on our knees right now and grab the information by force. The name Kizen is that great, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSimon didn\u2019t falter.Instead, he grabbed her slender hands grabbing his chin.\u201cInteresting deduction. Then shall I try it this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dSimon leaned over, pulling her hand slowly.\u201cA grave incident occurred that is shaking up the entire territory. The lord was in crisis, and as you\u2019ve said, he asked for help from numerous organizations.\u201dThe grip of the hand holding her became stronger and stronger. Her smile stiffened slightly.\u201cAnd the only information guild that exists in this territory. Whether it was the lord\u2019s side or the commissioned people\u2019s, everyone must\u2019ve stopped by here to get information. In conclusion, no one has been able to solve it.\u201dSimon approached her little by little, and this time, she was the one who moved away from him.\u201cThe same incident has been happening for several years, yet the culprit hasn\u2019t been found, let alone the case being solved. Don\u2019t you think that there\u2019s strangely too little information? If it\u2019s this much, the information wasn\u2019t really controlled, but everyone was getting lost because of the clever lies mixed with the given truth.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what kind of recognition and influence this Thieves Guild had in this territory, but for Simon, an outsider, they were defying common sense.Looking at her hardened face, Simon coldly said,\u201cAm I wrong? There\u2019s no way that the Thieves Guild, located in the middle of the crime scene, hasn\u2019t known the key information until now. Incompetence? Nah, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, looking at you.\u201dRevealing her true character, Simon\u2019s palm touched the back of her head.Then, he whispered as he slowly pulled her toward his face,\u201cBefore I flip everything on its head, give me the truth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Be careful!]Pier\u2019s seemingly nervous voice echoed in his head.Simon focused all his attention on the hostess\u2019 legs exposed through the dress because of the dagger on the band tied to her thigh.But in the end, her hand didn\u2019t head towards the dagger. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you please release my arm?\u201dSimon belatedly realized that he had put too much force on his hand holding her wrist.As Simon let her go, the hostess sat back down and combed back her disheveled hair.\u201cVery well.\u201dShe nodded.\u201cIf you want the truth that badly, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. However, you\u2019ll have to bear all the risks that come with the information. Are you okay with that?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d\u201cThen please wait here for a moment.\u201dThe hostess got up and walked to another room. The war-like atmosphere eased up, and Simon let out a small sigh.\u2018Pier, it was just a hunch, but it looks like there\u2019s actually something here. If we\u2019re lucky, we might be able to find out the whereabouts of Elizabe\u2014\u2019[Uhehehehehe!]Pier sitting next to Simon heaved his shoulders with laughter.[Hahahahahahahahahahah!]Simon frowned and covered his ears. Of course, that didn\u2019t really make the voice ringing in his head any weaker, though.\u2018Wh-What\u2019s so suddenly wrong?\u2019[I was dubious about it, but now I\u2019m certain. Stay alert, Boy!]Pier\u2019s eyes gleamed inside the helm.[That woman is Elizabeth!]\u201c\u2026\u2026Whaaaat?!\u201dThe moment Simon uttered a surprised voice without knowing, a change began to take place inside the Thieves Guild.The bodies of people sitting, drinking, or playing poker swelled up with cracking noises.[Kuhahahahaha! You\u2019re really a bold one, Boy! To threaten an ancient undead right in front of you! If I hadn\u2019t emitted bloodthirst from your side, your neck would\u2019ve been blown away already!]Zzzzip!Riip!The skins of the people were torn, and spiders with dozens of eyes popped out from within them.Simon stepped back in terror.[Shhhhhhhk!][Shhk! Shhhhhhhhhkl!]A type of undead known as a \u2018Corpse Spider\u2019.They were Elizabeth\u2019s kin. Simon and Pier were surrounded by spiders in an instant.\u201cThat was a great force, Kid of Kizen.\u201dThe footsteps of the hostess rang out as she reentered. Then, she crossed her legs after getting on the table with a voluptuous figure.As she dropped her forehead down with the tip of her index finger, the flesh flowed down like a garment, revealing her foreign crimson eyes.[Kill everyone.]Her voice turned dark.Using it as a signal, the corpse spiders began to jump in from all sides.[Boy!]Shouted Pier. Simon quickly activated the subspace equipped on his finger and called out Pier\u2019s greatsword.Lightly grasping that heavy weapon with both hands, Pier stepped forward with his right foot and made a wide sideways swing with it.Bwaaaaaaaaaaaash!A huge line split the air, and the bodies of the corpse spiders that entered the gap were split in half. Green blood splattered into the air, wetting the floor and ceiling.[Elizabeth!]Pier\u2019s loud cry resounded as though it would destroy the basement.[Oh my, so it was you after all, Pier.]Elizabeth crossed the other leg and smiled.[What kind of wicked plan are you plotting in a village like this?! The Legion has revived! Stop this nonsense and come back immediately!]She smiled with her eyes and stretched out her arm.[I refuse.]The ceiling was destroyed with a loud noise, and the corpse spiders dangling on spider webs attacked them.Simon quickly noticed it and ducked down, and Pier swung his greatsword to slash them. Blood and entrails splattered across floor.[Pier, you\u2019re stupid. Richard used us to his liking and kicked us to the curb. Do you still have lingering attachments for the Legion even after that shuddering experience?][You idiot!]Shouted Pier after piercing through the body of a rushing spider with his greatsword.[Did your mind rot while living along with humans? Legion is \u2018strength\u2019 and \u2018will\u2019! Blabbering things like kicking us to the curb or a shuddering experience\u2026 How could a captain of the Legion be swayed by such trivial emotions?!][How could I not?]There was a great hatred in her crimson eyes.[I hate Richard to the point of death with how he pushed his comrades that shared sorrows and joys for decades to a deadly place just because of a woman.]The undead spiders rushed in endlessly. In fact, this basement was full of corpse spiders.[And\u2026]Her gaze turned to Simon.[Pier, I pity you too. A 1st-year boy in Kizen, just like when you and Richard met. So you wheedled a kiddo who\u2019ll behave well instead of him to\u2014]Whaaaaap!In an instant, the white greatsword ripped through the air and flew in front of Elizabeth. She urgently grabbed the greatsword with both her hands.Poooooow!The shockwave alone blew away objects and shattered glass.[That\u2019s it! You\u2019re being too arrogant now!]Pier stretched out his hand.The handle of the greatsword flickered with jet-black and returned to Pier\u2019s hand at a tremendous speed.Seeing that, Simon\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2018The attraction of a skeleton!\u2019Pier twisted his waist like a combination lock and swung his greatsword. The slash shot out like a tsunami and once again struck Elizabeth\u2019s body.Whaaaaaaaam!She frowned and received the slash with both arms.[Have you already forgotten the time you crawled like a dog under me? How dare you try to walk over a Marshall of the Legion!]At that moment, jet-black as red as blood gathered on Elizabeth\u2019s fingernails. The slash pushing Elizabeth to the end of the wall cracked with a loud noise, and then shattered like pieces of glass.[And you\u2019ve weakened a lot, Pier. It seems like it hasn\u2019t been long since your seal has been released.]She stepped on the crumbled debris and climbed to the ground.[Are you running away?!]With his greatsword raised, Pier tried to chase her, but the corpse spiders blocked his way. Pier\u2019s face contorted.[You small fries!][See you next time, Pier. And\u2026]Waving from above, Elizabeth\u2019s gaze focused on Simon.[Boy of Kizen.]After leaving those words, she disappeared along with a spider waiting above.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018\u2026\u2026So that\u2019s how it is.\u2019The only Thieves Guild remaining in this territory was actually Elizabeth and her group.Controlling and modifying information would\u2019ve been a piece of cake. No wonder why the Lord couldn\u2019t solve the case, no matter how much time and money he invested.[Shhhhhhhhhhhk!]Other than that, there were disgustingly high numbers of spiders, even after Elizabeth left. Pier was struggling, but at this rate, they might lose Elizabeth.\u201cOh, what a shame.\u201dSimon got goosebumps for an instant. A 3rd person\u2019s voice was heard at an unexpected moment.When he turned his head quickly, he saw someone from right behind him standing up.It was that woman wearing a robe, drinking alone in the Thieves Guild. The spiders noticed her and jumped at her.\u201cWell~ there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I guess I\u2019ll just get rid of everyone here and chase her.\u201dFlash!A pure white flash of light erupted from the end of the staff she lifted above her head. Simon couldn\u2019t help but be terrified after realizing what that power was.[Kieeeeeeeh!][Shhk! Shhk!]The spiders twisted and suffered like vampires who were exposed to sunlight. The white light at the end of the staff grew brighter and became big enough to swallow the entire Thieves Guild.\u2018Pier! Let\u2019s run, using this as a chance!\u2019[What?]\u2018Hurry!\u2019She lowered her staff.\u201cFarewell, everyone!\u201dWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!The divine explosion exploded, turning all undead spiders within range into dust. The entire Thieves Guild was coiled in a pure white light.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter using her divine magic and placing her staff over her shoulder, she looked around her.\u201cLooks like I lost that huge skeleton and the boy. Guess I can\u2019t help it.\u201dShe turned her head and jumped into the crumbled debris in the direction Elizabeth had fled.* * *[Kuhehe! A priest is breaking in at this moment, huh? The situation is going crazy!]Pier was running shoulder to shoulder with Simon.\u2018\u2026\u2026A priest.\u2019Simon was lost in deep thought.He chose the blue request form and came to the country of the Dark Alliance, but he never imagined that he\u2019d meet a priest here like this.\u201cShe seemed to have the skills too, right? Since she wiped out that many at once.\u201d[I saw white clothes in that woman\u2019s robe. It\u2019s definitely the uniform of Efnel.]\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dShe wasn\u2019t just a Priest, but a student belonging to Efnel, the antipode of Kizen!By the standards of Kizen, it was like she was taking on a mission from a black request form.[Considering that she came all the way to Dark Alliance, she must be a 2nd-year student. Be careful, Boy! She\u2019s a tough opponent for you to deal with now!]\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be careful.\u201dJust like Simon, she seemed to be chasing Elizabeth.Then that meant the Lord of Arnish had commissioned this mission to both Kizen and Efnel.\u2018Double request. I\u2019ll have to quibble about that next time. By the way\u2026\u2019The scale was becoming too large for a blue request form.An ancient undead opposing the Legion, and even a student from Efnel.Simon started to wonder what the best way was to untangle this twisted thread.\u201cPier.\u201d[What is it?]\u201cTell me more about Elizabeth, please.\u201d[What I told you while on the way here was everything.]\u201cNo. Not about her abilities or physical strength, but more personal things.\u201dSimon gulped.\u201cWhat happened between my father and Elizabeth?\u201dPier let out a feigned laugh.[Kuhehehe! What happened my ass! Dammit!]\u201cWhat?\u201d[\u2026\u2026Fine, I\u2019ll tell you. Elizabeth loved Richard.]Simon\u2019s jaw dropped.[An undead to a human. An entity belonging to the Legion ended up having feelings toward the Commander.]Pier had a displeased look while saying that.[She was unusual from the beginning when she joined the Legion. She was emotional, unlike an undead, and she was often swayed too much by those emotions.]Pier lined up the stories related to Elizabeth.Elizabeth\u2019s love, her obsession with Richard, and even her jealousy toward Anna.Simon closed his eyes and pondered.[We\u2019re here, Boy!]The place that Pier dropped Simon off was somewhere in the forest near the Arnish territory. Simon looked around him, looking at the dense coniferous forest.\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing here.\u201d[Step back!]Pier swung his greatsword and cut through the air. Then, the space split apart as though it was torn, and an old ruined castle surrounded by cobwebs was revealed.[Kuhehe! This is their main base.]\u201cLet\u2019s head in.\u201dSimon and Pier opened the door and entered the abandoned castle.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026!\u2019And as soon as they entered, a quite explicit scene was laid out in front of their eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looks like these were the people who had disappeared from the territory.A corpse was also found on the floor, and it was the same kind of desiccated corpse as the ones found at the scenes of the incidents.It seemed inevitable that Elizabeth was, as expected, behind the missing cases.\u201cPerson! It\u2019s a person!\u201dSome people in the territory found Simon at that moment.\u201cH-Help me! Please let me out of this!!\u201d\u201cThe spider monsters are trying to eat us!\u201dLarge amounts of clamor broke loose.Simon nodded calmly, pulled out his sword from the subspace, and cut the cobwebs.\u201cPlease help too, Pier.\u201d[Heh. What a bunch of useless bastards.]As Pier clicked his tongue and swung his greatsword, the five people hanging from the spider\u2019s web fell.Because they fell while hanging upside down, groans could be heard from everywhere.Simon said while making a wry smile,\u201cPier, be gentle.\u201d[I don\u2019t want to waste my time on such pathetic bastards!]Still, Pier swung his sword once more and dropped the people to the floor.After using his shortsword to cut the spider\u2019s web binding a person, Simon handed the sword to them.\u201cPlease release the rest of them with this. We\u2019ll go hunt those spider monsters.\u201d\u201cTh-Thank you so much!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll never forget what you have done for us!\u201dWhile they freed each other from the webs, Simon and Pier started moving back into the abandoned castle.[Boy! Aren\u2019t you too merciful towards captives for a Necromancer?]Simon asked, tilting his head,\u201cThen what should a Necromancer do?\u201d[Obviously, you should kill them every time you see them! Raise them up as a skeleton to use as your power!]\u201c\u2026\u2026I told you that, in Kizen, killing people to turn them into undead is prohibited.\u201d[This place is the site of an accident, and there\u2019ll be no witnesses. So what\u2019s wrong with it? Aren\u2019t you the type of person who\u2019s not bound by such notions?]Simon scratched the side of his head and smiled bitterly.\u201cThe truth is, there\u2019s a saying that my father always told me, you see.\u201d[What is it?]\u201cDo not turn into a monster.\u201dPier shut his mouth after getting startled by those words.\u201cAnd he said that it\u2019s very important to set a line to not become a monster.\u201dThe corners of Pier\u2019s lips rose up terribly.[An advice that can be given because it\u2019s Richard, huh?]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Kuhehehe! No, it\u2019s nothing! If that\u2019s your will, I, as the Marshall of the Legion, will gladly respect it!]The two passed through the hallway and entered the spacious area of the old castle.The windows were a destroyed mess, and the moonlight shone through them. It was a place full of dust and cobwebs.And\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYou could see Elizabeth sitting on a large chair and drinking tea in the distance.[Kuhehe! Did you give up on running away?]Pier spoke while raising his sword. She took a light sip of her tea and smiled with her eyes.[Not really, Pier. Since you have sensed my jet-black, you would chase me to the ends of the continent no matter where I run, right?][You know it very well!][Then I just thought I\u2019d have to get rid of you here.]She snapped her fingers.Spiders rushed in through the ceiling and broken windows. Simon and Pier quickly stood back-to-back.[And now that you\u2019ve released my toys, I think I\u2019ll need a new one.]She licked her lips and looked at Simon.[I think it\u2019ll be a pleasant entertainment if I tease that Kid of Kizen you\u2019re taking care of in front of you, don\u2019t you think?]The moment Pier frowned and was about to open his mouth, Simon reached out and stopped him.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Pier.\u201d[Boy!]\u201cI\u2019m the Commander of the Legion. I\u2019ll try to talk to her from now on.\u201dSimon strode forward.The spiders made screeching sounds and prepared to jump at any moment, but Simon didn\u2019t mind them.\u201cCaptain of the former Legion, Elizabeth.\u201d[\u2026\u2026?]She looked at Simon with curious eyes.\u201cI\u2019m making a formal proposal. Please join my Legion.\u201d[Hah.]She let out a small laugh.[Didn\u2019t you hear what I was talking about with Pier? I have no intention of re-joining the Legion that had already abandoned me once. Furthermore\u2026]The tip of her index finger pointed at Simon.[You\u2019re telling me to work under a Necromancer who has no fundamentals like you, and was just chosen by Pier getting nostalgic of his past? I hate such vulgar jokes.][Pft! Bwahahahahahahah!]Suddenly, Pier\u2019s loud laughter broke loose from behind. Elizabeth\u2019s expression stiffened up terribly.[What\u2019s so funny, Pier?][Hehehehehe! I chose him because he resembled Richard? How ridiculous! You don\u2019t know anything about him!]A question mark appeared on her face.\u201cI guess there\u2019s no need to hide it anymore.\u201dSimon put his hand on his chest and continued.\u201cI\u2019m the son of Richard Polentia and Anna Polentia, Simon Polentia.\u201d[\u2026\u2026!!]Her face distorted beyond expression.[Richard and Anna\u2019s\u2026\u2026!]The worst enemy who had forsaken her, and the woman she hated more than anyone else.The child born between the two.The traces of the two uniting.\u201cI\u2019m saying it again, Elizabeth.\u201dAs if adding fuel to a burning fire, Simon coldly said,\u201cYou once belonged to my father.\u201d[\u2026\u2026Stop.]\u201cSo, as his son and as Commander of the Legion, it would be natural for me to retrieve you.\u201d[Stoooooooooop!]Something that she hid somewhere in her heart.Something she wanted to keep buried, the thought that she \u2018forgot\u2019 about already.Those rotting emotions exploded and took over her head.[Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!]Elizabeth twisted her entire body painfully.Her fingernails scratched and tore at her neck and shoulders, blood gushing out. Her body spread out, and six huge legs protruded from her thighs and side, stepping down to the floor.The mask covering her face disappeared, a woman with monster-like eyes taking its place.Her upper body was a human\u2019s, and her lower body was a spider\u2019s. This was the true form of Elizabeth as an undead.[Die! Dieeeeeeeeeeeeeee!]Elizabeth, who lost her mind and went out of control, jumped straight at Simon.If she couldn\u2019t get rid of this terrible remnant right now, she thought she\u2019d go crazy. Her nails formed up with jet-black grew longer, going straight at Simon\u2019s neck.And Simon just stood there expressionlessly.[Well done, Boy!]Flap!In an instant, Simon\u2019s vision was covered by Pier\u2019s back and his cape. A loud and clear sound of something being slashed was heard through the cape.Soon, the cape went down, and revealing Pier wielding a greatsword and Elizabeth falling to the floor with four of her legs severed.\u2018A chance!\u2019This time, Simon moved. He held a spear that came out from the subspace in his hand.\u2018Jet-Black Enchantment.\u2019The tip of the spear was dyed in jet-black. Pier smiled before stepping aside, and Simon leaped out like lightning, thrusting his spear.Pssshk!But it didn\u2019t fully penetrate. Elizabeth held the tip of the spear with her right arm to hold it. Simon brutishly trampled on Elizabeth\u2019s face and put more force on the spear.\u201cThis is the last chance.\u201dSimon said in a cold voice,\u201cAre you going to join the Legion, or are you going to perish?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[Hmph!]She stretched out her still remaining legs like a gimlet. Pier quickly jumped in front of Simon.Slaaaash![Kuugh!]It was so powerful that Pier\u2019s plate armor ripped like a piece of paper. Simon clenched his teeth and put strength on the tip of his spear.The corpse spiders were approaching to rescue their master between the human and two undeads fighting.And right above that\u2026Whiiirr!A white light emerged. Seeing that, Pier shouted,[Dammit! Dodge!]Soon, the light expanded at an incredible speed and landed on the floor.A dazzling scattering of light spread out and tore apart the surrounding.Ruuuuumble![Tsk!]Pier, retreating from the explosion\u2019s radius, went to a knee and put Simon down.The spiders caught in the explosion disappeared without a trace. Elizabeth was leaning against the wall gasping for breath. Looks like she somehow dodged, even with half of her legs slashed.\u201cWhat a waste~ That was perfect timing, though!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned. A girl with staff was seen from behind the collapsed wall.[How dare a priest like you\u2026!]Elizabeth stretched out her hand violently. The spiders on the ceiling jumped straight at her.\u201cWell, I guess I can\u2019t help it~\u201dAs she swung her staff lightly, daggers of light flew and lodged themselves in the spiders\u2019 bodies. The spiders twisted and screamed as though in pain.\u2018She\u2019s strong after all.\u2019Simon\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cThe old evil spirits, and disgusting swarms of spiders. I shall annihilate all of you in this place!\u201dShe took something like a jewel from her pocket, threw it over her head, and hit it with her staff right as it dropped.As the jewel broke, a huge amount of divinity erupted like an explosion.\u201cGoodbye!\u201dWhaaaaaaaaaap!The expanding white light soon turned into countless daggers of light and scattered in all directions. Simon and Pier quickly escaped by hiding behind the pillar.Heavy daggers of light indiscriminately stabbed down on the floor, and the corpse spiders splattered into blood.\u2018\u2026\u2026This is hard.\u2019Simon bit his lip.Elizabeth should be captured, not killed. Dealing with her alone was already difficult, but the spiders kept on flocking, and there was even the Efnel student.[Boy! Now that it has come to this, we need to deal with that priest first!]\u201cCan we win?\u201d[Heh! The divinity just gets in the way, but one strike is enough for that level!]Simon nodded.Elizabeth was basically captured. They\u2019d cut off her legs and sealed her mobility.Pier hid behind the pillar.\u201cOh my!\u201dAt that moment, the priest spun her staff and smiled. Her gaze was directed at Elizabeth.\u201cLooks like your legs are in pain!\u201dElizabeth had daggers of light stabbed all over her body, unable to dodge them with her injured legs.As the priest stretched out her staff, a pure-white magic circle came into sight, and a spear made of divinity appeared from within.\u201cMission accomplished!\u201dWhiiish!The spear of divinity flew at a frightening speed. While Elizabeth was staring blankly at it\u2026Staaaab![Ah\u2026\u2026?]It was something that shouldn\u2019t have happened. Simon stood in front of her with his arms outstretched. Elizabeth\u2019s eyes shook frantically.\u201cKugh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe divine spear went straight through Simon\u2019s back and out his chest.There was no physical damage, but for something with a core in its body, like a Necromancer or natural undead, divinity was more lethal than a deadly poison.[Wh-Why did you\u2026?]Elizabeth was still in shock.Simon fell to his knees. His vision flickered with the excruciating pain.Slowly, his vision darkened, and Simon collapsed.* * *Crackle crackle.Simon slowly opened his eyes to the sound of a bonfire burning.\u2018\u2026\u2026?\u2019The atmosphere was so quiet, the chaos a while ago felt awkward. As he moved his head, he suddenly saw a multi-eyed corpse spider right in front of him.Simon sat up in surprise.[Shh. Shhhhk\u2026\u2026!]But the spider didn\u2019t attack. Rather, it rubbed its face on Simon\u2019s arm and looked up at him as if asking if he was okay.[Oh! Are you awake, Boy?]Pier, who was sitting on the floor with his greatsword sticking on the ground, smiled.Simon got up with blank eyes and looked around.They were still inside that abandoned castle.Those terrifying spiders were quietly crawling around the floor. Pier also didn\u2019t seem to attack the spiders.And\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026Elizabeth.\u2019She had returned to her human form. She turned her head away as soon as she made eye contact with Simon.Simon remembered that she was badly injured, but fortunately, she appeared okay.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dThe sounds of coughing rang out from above.When he raised his head, that priest was hanging upside down from the ceiling, bound in a spider\u2019s web.\u201cY-Young master!\u201dBecause of the smoke from the bonfire coming from below, she was gushing out tears and snot.\u201cPlease save me! Uhuhuhuhu!\u00a0Cough! Cough!\u201dSimon let out a silly laugh.What the hell was going on\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to Pier, it was a very boring battle.\u201cLet her down first.\u201dSimon decided to listen to her story first.Before dying from suffocation by the smoke from the bonfire, the priest came down from the ceiling and knelt, tied in a cobweb.\u201cThank you! Thank you! Uhuhuhuhuh! I was so scared!\u201dMelting in tears, she looked as young as expected. She clearly looked like she was Simon\u2019s age, or a year or two older.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to say thank you yet. Answer the questions that I\u2019ll be asking from now on.\u201d\u201cYes!\u00a0Sniffle!\u201d\u201cAre you a student of Efnel?\u201dIt was quite an important question. Kizen and Efnel were on an armistice, but they were definitely in a hostile relationship, and Simon letting her go could be a problem.But she frantically shook her head and denied it.\u201cD-Definitely not!\u201d[Kuhehe! You\u2019re lying from the first question.]Pier grinned and pointed his greatsword at her. The priest\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth! Please trust me!\u201d[Stand.]She jumped to her feet, terrified. Pier cut off her robe from bottom to top with his greatsword.White legs were exposed through the cut robes, and a pure white skirt was visible. As it went to the top, you could see an outfit anyone would know.Efnel\u2019s school uniform made with Holy Shroud, said to surpass that of Kizen\u2019s, armed with advanced defenses against dark magic.Even the pattern of Efnel attached to the school uniform was exactly the same.[Sly priests always lie through their teeth anyway.]Elizabeth placed her hand on the priest\u2019s shoulder and moved her tongue.\u201cHiek!\u201dThe priest shut her eyes tight.[There\u2019s no need to listen anymore. Let\u2019s kill her right now and continue our talk.]\u201cTrust me! The truth is, I-I\u2026\u2026!\u201dShe blushed and lowered her head. She then gently bit her lip and opened her mouth carefully.\u201cI was expelled from Efnel two years ago.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Hm?\u2019So she wasn\u2019t a second-year? Simon blinked at her unexpected answer.Pier and Elizabeth looked uninterested, but Simon had a reaction. She looked at Simon with desperate eyes.\u201cPlease trust me! I was indeed in Efnel for a while! However, I\u2019m just a mediocre commoner like anyone else and couldn\u2019t hold out in their 1st year, getting kicked out! Killing someone like me won\u2019t bring any benefit to Kizen!\u201cThen why are you still wearing the uniform of Efnel? I\u2019m sure they retrieve it when someone gets expelled.\u201dHer face turned even redder.\u201c\u2026\u2026I-I impersonated. Them.\u201d\u201cImpersonated?\u201d\u201cYes. Times were really tough back then, and I also couldn\u2019t accept the fact that I was kicked out of Efnel\u2026\u2026 So I forged a fake student ID and school uniform, took missions, and made money as an Efnel student! That\u2019s it!\u201dHer expression contorted with shame and sorrow.\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find any mission with rumors spreading in the Holy Federation\u2026\u2026 so I took missions in the dangerous Dark Alliance\u2026\u2026\u201d[Are you telling us to believe such an obvious lie?]Elizabeth smirked at her and grabbed the hem of her top.Elizabeth ripped her clothes as the girl looked up with a puzzled face.Riiiip!\u201cKyaaaaaah!\u201dShe screamed and shrank back in surprise. Elizabeth frowned as she looked at the torn pieces of clothing in her hand.[\u2026\u2026It\u2019s really nothing but fabric?]The girl sobbed and lowered her head more.\u201cDon\u2019t be too harsh on her.\u201dSimon got up from his seat and moved toward her.She shrank even more, turning her body away so that the torn part couldn\u2019t be seen.Rustle.Simon took off the robe he was wearing and covered her body.\u201cAre you okay? Cover yourself with this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Thank you!\u201dThe priest\u2019s eyes welled up with tears.And\u2026[\u2026\u2026]Elizabeth, who was watching that, immediately felt a mixture of complex emotions.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again.\u201dSimon returned to his seat at a leisurely pace and sat down.\u201cFirst of all\u2026 Hm. What\u2019s your name?\u201dIt was a very kind tone.She answered, quickly sitting on her knees, facing Simon.\u201cI-It\u2019s Ellen Zile!\u201d\u201cHow did you get this mission?\u201d\u201cThrough a middleman that goes in and out of the border\u2026\u2026 I was told that there was a high-paying job eliminating undead in the Dark Alliance.\u201dNot a word of Simon\u2019s interrogation could enter Elizabeth\u2019s head.\u201cHave you seen the Lord of Arnish?\u201d\u201cAh, yes! I heard the details of the mission from him.\u201d\u201cDo you have any evidence to prove that you received the mission from the Lord? Like documents or down payments.\u201dEverything\u2026 was very annoying.Simon treating the priest kindly.The priest looking at Simon with interest and talking.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019Purple petals were fluttering.Elizabeth felt something overlapping between the two of them talking.The memory was still clear. The image of man and woman whispering their love to each other in a field full of violets.The man she once loved more than anyone, Richard Polentia.The woman who stole such a man from her, Anna Cross.It was like this at that time too. Elizabeth, who followed after Richard on a hunch, hid in the grass and witnessed the two of them hugging each other.She saw the necromancer and the priest kissing each other.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[\u2026\u2026]I thought I had forgotten it already.This feeling\u2026 This terrible thing called feeling was once again forming an eternal nightmare in her heart.\u201cOkay, this should do.\u201dSimon obtained the documents provided by the middleman, the down payment from the Lord, and even the forged Efnel student ID.Ellen also didn\u2019t care about the money as long as she could save her life. Whatever it was, she just wanted to live.[Boy. What are you going to use all that for?]\u201cI\u2019m going to visit the Lord later.\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cI need to extort everything I can.\u201d[Kuhahahaha! Very well, very well. As expected from Richard\u2019s son!]\u201cU-Uhm\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen carefully asked while reading Simon\u2019s countenance,\u201cThen, can I now\u2014\u201d[Simon Polentia, was it?]Elizabeth spoke, cutting off Ellen.[Sure, I\u2019ll accept your offer to join the Legion.]Simon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cReally?\u201d[Yes, but I have one condition.]Her eyes gleamed fiercely.[Suffocate that priest to death with your own hands. Right now.]Ellen\u2019s face turned pale.[That\u2019s my only condition.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon raised his head and looked straight at Elizabeth.As their eyes met, Elizabeth felt her heart beating rapidly.He really looked like him.That man\u2026She thought it was going to be disgusting. The child born between Richard and the woman she didn\u2019t even want to mention.But it wasn\u2019t.That expressionless face made her heart race frantically.It broke down the nightmares of the heart and made warm springs appear.She couldn\u2019t understand her own feelings either.Was it Richard again?You couldn\u2019t forget him in the end?Was hating him just words?Don\u2019t you have pride or anything?Half of him has that woman\u2019s blood flowing, you know?\u2018But.\u2019Elizabeth wrenched her eyes closed.She really didn\u2019t want to admit it, but\u2026He was already irresistible to her.\u201cFormer Captain of the Spider Troops, Elizabeth.\u201dFinally, Simon\u2019s mouth opened.\u201cTell me why I have to strangle Ellen to death.\u201d[It\u2019s to prove if\u2026 I want to know if you\u2019re worthy of being my master.]\u201cI know.\u201dSimon\u2019s voice was weighty.\u201cI\u2019m asking why I have to prove my worth to you.\u201d[\u2026\u2026What?]\u201cYou seem to be misunderstanding something.\u201dSimon slowly rose from his seat.\u201cIt\u2019s true that you once belonged to my father\u2019s Legion, but he\u2019s him, and I\u2019m me. I\u2019ll form the Legion with my own judgment and standards. But after observing you for a while, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s cold voice\u2026\u201cDisqualified.\u201d\u2026pierced her chest.He broke her heart and set loose the nightmare of her feelings once more.\u201cEven though you\u2019re undead, you have too many emotions in your thoughts. You don\u2019t even know what\u2019s important after being swayed by your emotions. What in the world can I prove by strangling that woman?\u201dHer heart sank with the feeling of a guilty conscience.It felt like she was naked.\u201cTelling me to prove it must also be an excuse.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just doing what you want to do. You want to manipulate me according to your impulsive and vulgar desires. I can\u2019t believe or trust you like that. There\u2019s no value in an uneasing existence like you in my new Legion.\u201dSimon turned his back.\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Pier, Ellen.\u201d[\u2026\u2026]The moment she saw Simon\u2019s back. Elizabeth almost unconsciously reached out her arm.\u201cLooks like\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes as he glanced back were so cold.\u201cWe wasted our precious time.\u201d* * *The night was getting late. Simon, who had gotten out of the abandoned castle, was heading to the Lord\u2019s castle with Pier and Ellen.[By the way, Boy.]Said Pier.[Are you really going to give up on Elizabeth? Her abilities are useful in many ways, you see.]\u201cHey, no way.\u201dAnswered Simon with a soft smile.\u201cThis is just fighting over dominance. It was inevitable in order to not be swayed by that obsessive Elizabeth. But for sure, she\u2019ll have no choice but to come to me in the future.The corners of Pier\u2019s lips rose up.[If so, don\u2019t tell me\u2026 It was all part of your plan to get struck by that divine spear?]\u201cNo comment.\u201dPier giggled.[This little kid\u2026\u2026 Thinking of petty tricks just like your father! Kuhahaha!]Ellen, who was furtively looking at Simon from the side, intervened.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that attack back then.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ellen. You didn\u2019t shoot it aiming at me anyways.\u201d\u201cBut is your wound really okay? Your chest was pierced by a divine spear\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon said while touching his chest,\u201cI\u2019m fine. Fortunately, I don\u2019t think the spear went right through my core.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a relief!\u201dActually, Simon didn\u2019t realize it, but the divine spear properly pierced the core.Pier also saw it. He was going to rip both Elizabeth and the priest to pieces with the anger of losing the contractor, but when he checked the condition of Simon\u2019s core, it was intact. The Legion\u2019s contract was also unaffected.It was something that couldn\u2019t happen with common sense, so even Pier had no choice but to think that, luckily, it didn\u2019t hit the core.\u2018How mysterious.\u2019\u2026\u2026No matter how much he thought about it, it made no sense.\u201cPier? What are you doing there on your own?\u201d[Nothing. I\u2019m on my way.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, outside of her firepower, she lacked in abilities, and she was expelled from school because she couldn\u2019t use the common healing magic. It was a pretty serious reason for disqualification as a priest.When he asked her why she was furiously trying to make money, it seemed that she had lost her parents and was raising her younger siblings by herself. He was able to know a new side of Ellen.\u201cU-Uhm. Mr Simon.\u201dHe smiled.\u201cJust call me Simon.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Simon.\u201dEllen had an unexplainable interest in this boy.During her time at Efnel, she was taught that all necromancers were terrifying and horrible monsters.But this boy was different. In fact, necromancers were also human beings, and they had warm hearts.\u201cAnyways, what is it?\u201d\u201cHehe. Now that we have gotten closer, we formed an alliance together, and I don\u2019t even have the skills to deal with the two of you.\u201dShe glanced at Simon and stretched her arms bound by ropes.\u201cSo, uhm\u2026\u2026 Could you please release this?\u201dInstead of answering, Simon still had a smile on his face. Ellen was sweating profusely.\u2018A-Ah. So that means no.\u2019[Kuhehe! So you finally went insane!]Pier glared inside the helmet.[Look, Boy! If you treat the captives well, they\u2019ll walk over you without knowing their place! Let\u2019s cut off some of her fingers to make her obedient\u2026\u2026]\u201cUwaaaah! I-I-I\u2019m sorry! Something must\u2019ve happened to my head!\u201dShe quickly fell flat on the floor, and Simon stopped them.\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you know. Pier, stop it too.\u201dPier put down his greatsword, and Ellen\u2019s face returned to normal. She thought that Simon was endlessly kind, but still quite alert.Soon, they arrived at the lord\u2019s castle.As planned, Ellen hid inside Pier\u2019s robe, and Simon and Pier approached the gate of the castle.\u201cStop right there! Who are you?\u201dThe guards of the gate raised their voices and their spears. Simon said while pretending to raise his arms,\u201cI came for the lord\u2019s mission. I want to see the lord in person right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cDid you get your head hit by an arrow or something? Meeting the lord at midnight?\u201dSimon nodded.\u201cYes. It\u2019s an urgent matter, so I think I\u2019ll have to see him right now.\u201dThe guards gave forced laughs as though dumbfounded.\u201cNow I\u2019m seeing all sorts of crazy bastards.\u201d\u201cDo you think that the lord is someone you can meet whenever you want to? Get lost while we\u2019re talking nicely.\u201d\u201cNo, this bastard is suspicious. Let\u2019s just tie him to that pole until the sun comes up.\u201dThe guard nodded and held the rope he had on his waist. Simon said while still putting on a smile,\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this.\u201d\u201cYou arrogant little brat\u2026\u2026 Who are you? Identify yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from Kizen.\u201dThe movement of the two guards stopped.\u201cBwahahahahaha! Fuck! This bastard is actually really fucking crazy!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re from Kizen, then I\u2019m Nefthis. You crazy bastard!\u201dThe two guards walked up to tie up Simon. Simon obediently stretched out his arms as if to let them.\u201cWhat\u2019s the commotion?\u201dAt that moment, the guard captain appeared from the wicket gate. The guards got frightened and saluted him.\u201cA-A suspicious bastard wanted to see the lord, so we were about to arrest him.\u201d\u201cSuspicious bastard?\u201d\u201cYes, he all of a sudden said he\u2019s from Kizen\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing those words, the guard captain\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cKi\u2026\u2026 zen?\u2019Mysterious disappearances within the territory.The lord, who wanted to hide this uneasy case ahead of an important event, secretly commissioned Kizen. Only the closest associates of the lord were aware of this.However, there was no response even after 3 months, so the lord stopped expecting anything from Kizen.\u2018\u2026\u2026But they actually came?\u2019The guard captain observed Simon\u2019s appearance carefully.Smart-looking eyes, a relaxed attitude, and even a tall, armored man accompanying him as a bodyguard.\u2018There\u2019s no mistake.\u2019Goosebumps ran across his entire body.This boy really was Kizen.\u201cDrop\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d\u201cDrop your damn heads, you shitheads!\u201dSuddenly shouted the guard captain.The guards immediately put their weapons down and prostrated, hands clasped behind their backs.Simon was scratching his head from the sudden change of atmosphere, and the guard captain approached Simon with his sword drawn.[What is it?]Pier grabbed the handle of their greatsword, but Simon raised his arm to stop them. The guard captain stood in front of Simon, stabbed his sword on the ground, and knelt down on one knee.\u201cThe training of my subordinates is entirely my fault. I\u2019ll apologize with my neck.\u201dThen he took a pose as though sticking out his neck. The guards raised a clamor as they saw it.\u2018\u2026\u2026Gosh. How uncomfortable.\u2019Simon gave a bitter laugh inwardly. Was there a need for him to go this far, even if Simon was from Kizen?And he wasn\u2019t even a second-year student. Simon was a first-year, a cheap life who never knew when he would return to his home. If he got expelled from Kizen, he would return to being a normal person. So, he thought he was never in a position where he could control people\u2019s lives at will.\u201cStop. Please stand up.\u201dThe guard captain stood up with a stiff face.\u201cIt was my fault for making a fuss late at night. The guards just did their job, so don\u2019t be too harsh on them too. Ah, please stand up, you two.\u201dThe guards with sweat-soaked brows sprang to their feet and stood at ease.Simon looked at the guard captain once again and said,\u201cMay I see the lord? I have something important to tell him about the mission.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Please, this way.\u201d[Kiekiekiekie!]Simon followed the guard captain, and Pier scoffed at the guards as though teasing them. The guards couldn\u2019t even raise their heads.\u2018\u2026\u2026Does this make sense?\u2019\u2018Why would Kizen be in this rural area?\u2019It was nearing dawn.The lord\u2019s castle went into uproar at the sudden visit of Kizen\u2019s personnel.The treatment with the utmost devotion continued as Simon entered the spacious reception room. Hot bread and food, tea, and wine were served. The maids even brought buckets of water and tried to wash his feet, but Simon quickly refused, it being too much for him.And after a while\u2026* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cI\u2019m honored to have you as a guest!\u201dA middle-aged man of short stature with a belly appeared, smiling widely. His face was swollen, as though he had just woken up.\u201cI\u2019m the Lord of Arnish, Count Raymond!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Simon Polentia, a first-year student at Kizen.\u201d\u201cYou must be exhausted after such a long journey! I heard that you came all the way here for my mission.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha! I wonder how I should repay this favor\u2026\u2026 You must\u2019ve accumulated a lot of fatigue from traveling! Forget about your work and please take a rest. We\u2019ll do our best to serve you during your stay!\u201d\u201cI barely had any fatigue from traveling.\u201dSaid Simon, sinking into the back of his seat.\u201cI came with the teleportation magic circle.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u2026\u2026! I-I see! Kizen\u2019s extraordinary, after all! Haha! Well, well, take a glass! It\u2019s a special product produced from the grapes of this land!\u201dRaymond drew the cork out of the wine bottle.A clear and strong smell of alcohol flew out. He poured wine into a glass and offered a toast.\u201cCome on.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dRaymond cleanly emptied his drink first. It wasn\u2019t polite to refuse, so Simon only pretended to drink with his lips.After a while, the maids served sumptuous dishes, such as a huge whole pig barbecue. After declining it, saying he had already finished eating dinner, Simon said,\u201cOther than that, I\u2019d like to talk about the mission.\u201d\u201cAh, the mission! That\u2019s important too, but it\u2019s already night-time, and wouldn\u2019t it be more important to relieve the fatigue built up in your body? You wouldn\u2019t call life in Kizen a school life. It\u2019s a battlefield! Hahahah!\u201dAs Raymond clapped his hand, the side door of the reception room opened.Simon was terrified. Scantily dressed women swarmed Simon. About five people also stood behind Raymond.\u201cNow, take your time to pick the one you like! Hahahah!\u201dHe had nowhere to settle his gaze.Raymond grinned with satisfaction when Simon looked down at his knees, blushing.\u2018Even if he\u2019s Kizen, he\u2019s still a baby beast that hasn\u2019t even grown any teeth yet. I might be able to coax him more easily than I thought.\u2019As Raymond gave the signal, the women behind him embraced Simon\u2019s shoulders and arms. The other two knelt at both sides of Simon and began pouring a drink into a golden glass.\u201c\u2026\u2026Lord.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Yes, which one would you like to pick?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still a minor, and it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to be in a place like this.\u201dThere was a hint of embarrassment, but the strength and will in his voice were clear.\u201cI have an important thing that I want to discuss one on one with you, lord. Could you please return these people?\u201dRaymond gulped as he met Simon\u2019s eyes head-on.Wasn\u2019t this little fellow quite powerful? There was something about him that made people shiver.\u201c\u2026\u2026I-I guess there\u2019s no choice if you say so.\u201dRaymond reluctantly made the women leave. As they turned around with bummed faces, they winked or flirted with Simon.Simon thought that he\u2019d never be able to adapt to these cultures of adults.\u201cNow, the night is getting late. If the thing that you want to talk about is the mission, then let\u2019s do it tomorr\u2014\u201d\u201cNo. I have to do it right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaymond forced a smile. As long as he was coming out hard from that side, it was now harder for him to pass this matter nice and gently.This was his final option.\u201cCome in.\u201dWhen Raymond gave the signal, another door was opened. A butler dressed in a formal uniform bowed deeply and placed the box in front of Simon.The box contained various jewels and the commission fee of 50 gold.\u201cIt\u2019s the commission fee. Sorry to inform you late, but the case has already been resolved. Please have a comfortable rest in the castle for the remaining time, receive this commission fee, and return to school.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite different from what I found out.\u201dSoftly said Simon.\u201cI bought information from the Thieves Guild. I heard that another case happened this morning.\u201dRaymond gnashed his teeth.\u2018\u2026\u2026Those damn bastards! They don\u2019t do any good after all!\u2019\u201cI can\u2019t receive the rewards before completing the mission. I don\u2019t want to be bothered by Kizen\u2019s inspection later on.\u201d\u201cHahaha! I\u2019ll take care of that matter cleanly\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cPlease tell me about the mission.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dRaymond\u2019s expression turned cold.\u201cYou only stay still if I tell you to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re from Kizen, a first-year like you is trying to go against me, a lord and a count? Walk away from this while I\u2019m still being nice. I\u2019m saying that I\u2019ll even pay the commission. Why are you being so picky about this?\u201dHad he finally revealed his true colours?Simon grinned.\u201cFrom solicitation to threats. You\u2019re playing it hard, Lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like you\u2019re too agitated. I\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning. Let\u2019s talk again then.\u201dSimon slowly got up from his seat, the corners of his lips rising.\u2018Now, take the bait.\u2019And exactly as Simon expected, Raymond slammed his fist down on the armrest.\u201cI\u2026 told\u2026 you\u2026 to stay here!\u201dClunk! Clunk! Clunk!Different doors opened, and more than ten armed guards rushed into the room.He was quickly surrounded by guards, but Simon didn\u2019t have the slightest sense of worry on his face.\u201cResorting to force in the end.\u201dSimon pulled the imaginary lever with a relaxed gesture.\u201cThen we can\u2019t just stay still either.\u201dWhaaaaaap!A subspace opened on the floor, skeletons with blue flames swirling in their eye sockets coming out.\u201cU-Undead!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s undead!\u201dWith the sound of rattling bones, the guards were instantly outnumbered by the conscripted skeletons.The guards\u2019 faces stiffened sharply.All the people of the continent had a deep-rooted fear of the undead and necromancers. The fear passed down through education, history, and brainwashing wasn\u2019t something you could easily get rid of.\u2018H-How many are there?\u2019And Raymond\u2019s eyes were also shaking.He heard that the measure of a necromancer\u2019s strength was their number of summons.But a first-year who could control a platoon!He definitely wasn\u2019t an ordinary guy. No, it must\u2019ve been a lie when he introduced himself as a first-year student.[Kwahahahahahaha!]Pier took off the helmet on his head and threw it. A skull with blue flames lashing out of his eyes appeared.\u201cUhieek!\u201d\u201cI-It wasn\u2019t a human?\u201d[Good! Very good! Looks like we\u2019ll be having lots of new additions to our family today!]The loud voice resounded out.Pier\u2019s mouth opened up like a monster\u2019s. Fear spread like a plague, and the soldiers\u2019 legs trembled.\u201cNow.\u201dSimon slowly walked up.Raymond unknowingly stepped back in terror, and Simon sat down on the lord\u2019s seat, smiling.\u201cWill you continue?\u201dThe undead cried for blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The lord strained his eyes.\u201cThe Dark Alliance firmly acknowledges the autonomy of the countries and territories it belongs to. This is an area that Kizen can\u2019t be involved in! If it develops into a diplomatic issue, how do you plan to deal with it?\u201dSimon, who was sitting down on the Lord\u2019s seat, gave a faint smile.\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201dHe took the evidence from his pocket and dropped it on the floor.The contract from the middleman, advance payment given to Ellen, and even the remains of a torn Efnel school uniform.\u201cYou seem to have secretly communicated with a priest of Efnel.\u201dRaymond felt his blood chill to the bone.\u201cWhat was worse is that you did it after entrusting the mission to Kizen. In addition to treason, you led a clash between a necromancer and a priest. Can I interpret it this way?\u201d\u201cN-No, that\u2019s\u2014!\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly.\u201cAnd you said that my actions could turn into a diplomatic issue. Your actions could turn into a war across the continent with that logic. Am I right?\u201dRaymond was covered in a cold sweat.He was trying to keep Simon at the castle to prevent a clash between Kizen and Efnel due to a double booking of the mission. But he had already been caught by Kizen\u2019s side.He was agonized.\u2018At this point, I\u2019ll end up being killed. It won\u2019t just be me either. The entire territory will be annihilated. I need to do something. At this point, it\u2019s sink or swim now\u2026\u2026!\u2019Raymond jumped to his feet.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dThen, he shouted,\u201cHow can a person who has no power other than belonging to Kizen discuss treason with such crude evidence?!\u201dSimon let out a smirk. It was like the lord was rushing in with his neck exposed.But it didn\u2019t really feel bad.He thought that watching the opponent struggle while holding all the cards by himself was quite enjoyable.[Kuhehehe! Your true personality is starting to reveal, Boy!]\u2018\u2026\u2026My head\u2019s ringing, so please stay quiet, Pier.\u2019Simon looked back at Pier and bobbed his head. Then, Pier removed the robe wrapped around his body.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026 Huh?\u201dRaymond\u2019s eyes began to tremble.This was wrong. This was really wrong.Revealed from Pier\u2019s robe was Ellen. She was standing blankly, eyes glazed over. Her head was tilted and drool fell from her mouth.A magic circle was drawn on her forehead.\u201cWe captured the Efnel priest during the mission.\u201dSaid Simon as though sentencing someone to death.\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious for now with a curse. If we send her to Kizen for interrogation, we\u2019ll be able to draw out a lot of stories, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThud.Raymond fell to the floor.* * *The situation was settled. Raymond confessed all his crimes and begged to spare at least this territory in exchange for his life.One thing that was a little surprising was that Raymond was a well-known person among the people of the territory.He risked all his political life to develop the territory and attracted investment from the merchants by running on his own feet. He even somehow managed to arrange a visit from the Crown prince.But the disappearance incidents held him back. If it became an issue, there was a fear that all his plans would be in vain, including the Crown Prince\u2019s visit.So, Raymond joined hands with Elizabeth, who was running the information guild, and blocked all information leaks. (Apparently, Elizabeth didn\u2019t realize that she was the culprit of the incidents.) He also secretly commissioned various mercenaries, famous knights, and Kizen.However, there was no response from Kizen for three months, and Raymond became impatient, eventually contacting the priest through a middleman.However, Simon intervened in the request that was about to be discarded in Kizen, and the situation twisted like this.\u201cPardon me all to hell.\u201dRaymond lay on the floor and burst into tears.\u201cTo speak the truth, I didn\u2019t believe in the middleman from the beginning. They said that she\u2019s a priest from Efnel, but I thought there was no reason for such a person to go through a middleman. I just accepted the offer out of desperation, but to think that a Efnel priest would actually come\u2026\u2026 I was too naive about this.\u201dSimon, who was sitting down pretending to be dignified, felt his guilty conscience rise to his face. At the same time, Ellen, lying on a sofa and pretending to be unconscious, also had a face full of a guilty conscience.In fact, the magic circle drawn on her forehead was also fake.\u201cThis incident was solely my fault! You can freely take my life! But please, spare this territory\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon, who was starting to feel guilty, coughed, and said,\u201cAlright. I understand the situation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLord Raymond. Let\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI just got here, but I have managed to like this territory. The front line close to the Holy Federation. I don\u2019t want this strategic point where we have to support many soldiers to be devastated when an all-out war breaks out.\u201dRaymond raised his head with a blank face.\u201cOf course, if things go according to procedure, Kizen will annihilate everything that was in this territory.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you caused this situation with malicious intent. I\u2019ll try to cover this case as far as I can to not damage the territory.\u201d\u201cC-Could you really do that?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try. But\u2026\u201dSimon lowered his voice and said,\u201cIt may cost quite a bit.\u201dRaymond hurriedly put his forehead to the floor and shouted,\u201cI\u2019ll pay it, even if it costs my entire fortune!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Just like that, Simon obtained 500 gold, 10 times the initial commission fee of 50 gold. He placed the huge money bag into the subspace and left the reception room with a sincere guide.[What was that, Boy? You only extorted a little compared to your vicious act.]\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I want to be satisfied with just getting this much in exchange for causing trouble.\u201dSaid Simon while shrugging his shoulders.\u201cIn fact, aren\u2019t all these precious taxes of the people from the territory? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re robbing bad people.\u201dThe corner of Pier\u2019s lips rose.As the son of former Legion Commander Richard, they had many similarities, but in the end, this boy had something fundamentally different from Richard.\u201cYou did a great job too, Ellen.\u201dEllen, who had been inside Pier\u2019s robe, stuck her head out.\u201cHehe! How was my acting? Wasn\u2019t it good?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wipe your saliva off first before speaking?\u201cA-Ahh!\u201dShe quickly went back into the robe out of embarrassment, and Simon giggled.When he was leaving the castle relaxedly with the feeling that he had settled a case, the surroundings suddenly became noisy.\u201cMove your asses!\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201dFully armed guards were rushing somewhere.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d[Looks like someone came to attack.]\u201cLet\u2019s go check it out.\u201dSimon also ran after the guards.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking down from the 2nd floor of the castle, countless corpse spiders were swarming in front of the castle gate, and in front of them stood a familiar person.Simon quickly turned his back and ran down the stairs.[Boy! Slow down a bit!]\u201cKyaaah! It hurts!\u201dSimon ran faster than the two of them and came to the front of the castle gate. The heavily armed guards were preparing for battle.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dIn response to Simon\u2019s question, the guard captain, who was wearing a helmet, found Simon and saluted him.\u201cIt\u2019s an undead! It seems that they\u2019re trying to attack the lord\u2019s castle. It\u2019s dangerous, so please stay ins\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease open the gate a bit. I\u2019ll try going.\u201d\u201cWh-What? But that\u2019s too dangerous!\u201dSimon smiled and placed his hand on his chest.\u201cI\u2019m still learning, but I\u2019m also a necromancer. Dealing with the undead is my job, so trust me.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u201dEventually, the guard captain opened the gate a little. Simon escaped through it, and Pier and Ellen, who followed Simon, joined him.As Simon looked back and nodded his head, the guard captain nodded with a firm face and closed the gate.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect her to act this reckless.\u2019Simon started walking slowly.In front of the swarm of spiders besieging the castle, you could see a woman in a wine-colored dress.The hostess of the Thieves Guild, and at the same time, the Captain of the Spider Troops, Elizabeth.\u201cWhat is it, Elizabeth?\u201d[Simon Polentia, son of former Legion commander, Richard Polentia. I, Elizabeth, want to serve you as my master. Therefore, I\u2019m begging for a chance to join your Legion and take your test.]Pier giggled and folded his arms.Simon calmed his expression and cleared his throat.\u201cPlease send away your subordinates. Let\u2019s talk in a quiet place.\u201d* * *Simon decided to part with Ellen before moving to his inn. He himself untied the ropes that bound her arms.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing good if today\u2019s incident gets known, so please keep it a secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe stared at Simon\u2019s face.\u201cHm? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, uh\u2026\u2026 You do seem a little different from the rumors of necromancers I\u2019ve heard after all, you see.\u201dPier grinned and raised his greatsword.[If you mean the stories of turning a person into a skeleton to keep a secret, I can fulfill it right now!]\u201cHieeek!\u201dShe got startled and hid behind Simon\u2019s back. Pier laughed out loud, and Elizabeth, who was watching from a distance, was biting her tongue and glaring at Ellen menacingly.\u201cAnd this.\u201dSimon held out a pouch from the subspace.\u201cIt\u2019s your share of the commission that I got from you earlier.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cTake care of your siblings.\u201dTouched, tears began to form in her eyes while she held the pouch to her chest.\u201cThank you\u2026\u2026! Thank you so much, Simon! I\u2019ll never forget what you\u2019ve done for me!\u201d\u201cWhere are you heading to again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a territory called Loharon, in the Holy Federation!\u201d\u201cYeah, I hope you\u2019ll safely get to the Holy Federation.\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you! I\u2019ll never forget this!\u201dWhen Simon was about to leave, turning his back, Ellen loudly shouted,\u201cWill we be able to meet again someday?\u201dSimon shrugged.\u201cWell, next time we meet might be on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen thought to herself that Simon was really good at drawing the line.\u201cIf I ever have to go to the Holy Federation, I\u2019ll be expecting you to guide me.\u201d\u201cYeah! Of course!\u201dAs though she was truly moved, she waved her hand vigorously until Simon and the others couldn\u2019t be seen.[Not only did you spare a priest, but you\u2019re giving her money and sending her away.]\u201cYeah.\u201d[What\u2019s the reason behind this?]Simon smiled slightly and crossed his arms.\u201cI just thought that it\u2019d be a good choice to make connections with a priest when I have to carry out a black request form mission someday. And, I just handed over the money to truly make her an accomplice and gain her trust.\u201d[Kuhehe! I can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re good or bad by watching your actions!]\u201cI wonder.\u201dSimon put his hand in his hood pocket and titled his head.\u201cIs it really necessary to separate it in such a black and white fashion?\u201d[\u2026\u2026]\u201cHalf of my blood is a priest\u2019s. I have no intention of hating people just because they live on the other side, and there\u2019s no reason to do so. It\u2019s the same reason for sending off Ellen this time and extorting only a bit of money from the territory. I don\u2019t have to get extreme, right? It\u2019s fine as long as I take my profits in the middle.\u201dThe corners of Pier\u2019s lips rose up deeply.[It seems that it\u2019ll take time for me to fully understand a human like you after all!]Simon smiled and turned his head.\u201cElizabeth.\u201d[Yes?]\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t attack Ellen, who I let go safely, by releasing spider troops, would you?\u201dShe flinched inside, but then lowered her head.[\u2026\u2026O-Of course.]\u201cAs long as you know it.\u201dSimon started joking around with Pier again. While following these two, Elizabeth was captured by strange emotions.Simon\u2019s back receiving the divine spear instead of her flickered in her vision.After being rejected by Simon once, Elizabeth made up her mind over and over again.She had no advantages for herself even if she joined the Legion. She\u2019d just be bound by a cumbersome contract, gaining nothing.However\u2026\u2018In the end, I\u2019m walking toward hell again with my own feet.\u2019She had never been, not a single time, able to overcome her own feelings\u201cElizabeth?\u201d[Ah, yes. I\u2019m on my way.]Still.Even if she regretted it, even if she couldn\u2019t see the future, even if the end would be terrifying\u2026She\u2019d make the same choice over and over again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter returning to the inn, Simon presented several requirements before signing a contract with Elizabeth.To not kill humans without permission, to hunt monsters when she needs to intake bodily fluids, to not harm the people around in any way, unconditional obedience to orders, and so on.In order to insert these terms into the contract, Simon rejected Elizabeth once.In Simon\u2019s opinion, Elizabeth was more emotional and impulsive than humans. Rather than like a trustworthy mentor like Pier, she was more likely to become the troublemaker of the Legion. He had to make sure that she was definitely under his control.And now, instead of him asking her to \u2018please join the Legion\u2019, she was asking him to let her join the Legion, so Simon had firmly taken the initiative.\u201cI\u2019m telling you again, but if you head to Roke Island with me, it might feel suffocating in Pier\u2019s ruins, the Forbidden Forest is your area of activity, and you won\u2019t be as free as you are now.\u201d[Yes. I\u2019m aware.]Elizabeth lowered her head and said,[Feel free to restrict my freedoms. I\u2019ll do anything to be with you.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t this undead all of a sudden too obedient? Of course, it was convenient from Simon\u2019s point of view, but it was also a bit bewildering.[All of my body and mind are yours. And I ask for only one thing in exchange for absolute loyalty.]Her eyes shone.[It\u2019s your affection.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026The pressure was rushing in.\u201cI\u2019m a human, and you\u2019re undead. If uhm, you uh\u2026\u2026 Want physical stuff, then\u2026\u2026\u201d[It\u2019s a different story if you want to, but I won\u2019t force you.]She smiled.[For now, adoring me is enough.]\u2026\u2026To be honest, it was super pressuring. Things she wanted, like affection or adoration\u2026 Simon had never received such a request from anyone in his life.[Tsk tsk.]Pier clicked his tongue.[She\u2019s totally into you.]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Nothing.]Anyways, it was pressuring in many ways, but he thought that this condition was acceptable in return for her loyalty. In the end, Simon decided to officially sign a contract with Elizabeth.[Then, let us proceed.]She grabbed the top of her dress with both her hands and pulled it wide open.\u201c\u2026\u2026Waah! Uwaaah! What are you so suddenly doing?!\u201dHis guard being lowered, Simon got startled and covered his eyes. Seeing his reaction, Elizabeth tilted her head.[Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll proceed with the contract?]Her chest opened, revealing a black core beating like a heart. Simon peeked through his fingers and looked at her core.\u2018Ahh, how lovely.\u2019How could being embarrassed be that cute? To think that he was really the same person who forced an unfair contract with a brazen face just a few minutes ago!She felt herself getting more and more excited.[Now, come on!]\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh.\u201dSimon had no choice but to approach her.Then, he took a deep breath and placed his hand on the open core inside her chest. The jet-black of the two then exploded and went wild.\u201cKugh!\u201d[Ahhhhh!]It was painful, but unlike the first time he signed a contract with the Legion, the time passed quickly.The jet-black stabilized, and Simon\u2019s dark-blue jet-black could be seen flowing from her body.[Kuhehe! Welcome back to the Legion, Elizabeth!]She slowly got up from her seat.[It\u2019s been so long since I was last an undead bound by a contract.]When Elizabeth reached out the tip of her hand, a spider\u2019s web shot out and stuck to the ceiling.Soon, her jet-black was overlaid on her webs, and it changed its color into a soft, dark-blue light. Rather than an unsightly spider web, it looked like a beautiful, fluorescent interior decoration.It was amazing from Simon\u2019s point of view.It really felt like she had become undead of his possession, so he felt like he grew close with her.[How is it, Elizabeth?!!][Mmmm.]She smiled after retrieving her webs.[It\u2019s unbelievably weak. As expected, you must be a beginner, Master.]\u201c\u2026\u2026Urk!\u201dSimon leaned his back against the wall, upset. Pier giggled while looking at him.[It\u2019s a little ironic to think that I became weaker after joining the Legion than when I was a natural undead.]The Legion\u2019s undead were connected to the jet-black of the Commander, and the stronger the Commander, the stronger the Legion. Of course, in the same manner, the opposite could happen too.Simon\u2019s face turned redder than ever. Pier was laughing so hard he looked like he was about to die.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry for being a beginner! Still, I\u2019m in Kizen right now, so in a month or two, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get\u2014!\u201d[But.]She raised dark-blue jet-black to her fingertips once again, and her face turned red.[It\u2019s a gentle and soothing jet-black.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, the wound already inflicted on the pride of the 17-year-old boy didn\u2019t heal.Simon strode over to the bed and covered himself with a blanket.\u201cI\u2019ll sleep.\u201d[Kuhahahahahaa! You\u2019re upset! Are you upset, Boy?!]\u201cWhy would I be upset when it\u2019s a matter of the fact that I\u2019m weak?\u201d[Oh my, I\u2019ve hurt your feelings, Master. Please let me apologize at your bedside.]\u201cGo away, both of you!\u201dPier and Elizabeth\u2019s laughter filled the room.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A whopping 50-gold mission. Simon cleared the mission within a day of teleporting in when even Jane saw it as difficult.If he returned to Kizen like this, he might be questioned about how he had cleared this mission in one day, so Simon decided to stay in the territory and train the Legion as much as he wanted while he was at it.Simon, Pier, and Elizabeth came to the northern mountain of the Arnish territory, where a large-scale habitat of orcs had formed.[Well then, Master! I shall begin the tutorial for the spider undead, corpse spiders, which you\u2019ll be controlling from now on.]Said Elizabeth while putting her hand on her waist.Spiders that had been conscripted for Simon\u2019s training were walking around her.Unlike the skeletons\u2019 eye sockets burning with jet-black, a dark-blue light shimmered from the ends of the eight legs.At that moment, Simon raised his hand.[Oh my, Master. The class hasn\u2019t even started yet. Do you already have a question?]\u201cNo, it\u2019s something unrelated to the class, but\u2026\u201dSimon scratched his head.\u201cAre you going to keep calling me that Master something?\u201d[Hohoho! Are you shy?]As she laughed while covering her mouth, Simon turned his head, blushing.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that, but it\u2019s just a little\u2026\u2026\u201d[If you say so. Then I\u2019ll just call you Commander. I\u2019ll proceed.]She gave her signal by snapping her fingers. One of her corpse spiders spat its web out of its mouth.[The main ability of the corpse spider would be the spiderweb ability called \u2018Web.\u2019 It\u2019s a binding skill as well as a movement skill.]\u201cMm.\u201d[Now, control the two corpse spiders that approached in front of you, Commander. And try shooting the web at the tree.]Simon nodded and accessed the thoughts of the two corpse spiders. He then ordered,\u2018Web.\u2019Thwip!Thwip!The corpse spiders shot webs from their mouths and accurately hit the tree. The spider web spread out slightly as it was fired, and as soon as it touched the tree, it wrapped up the tree\u2019s trunk.[Well done! Usually, the webs figured from the mouth are used for binding, and the webs fired from the tail are used for movement.]This time, the two corpse spiders fired webs from their tails.It was shot high and attached to a tall tree, and the spiders walked a little forward to lift their bodies off the ground.As though riding a rope, the spider\u2019s body moved like a pendulum.\u2018Woah! It\u2019s moving like that, but it\u2019s a lot faster than I thought!\u2019Then, it clung to the target tree and stabbed its fangs into it. It made a dent in the bark, and a green liquid flowed out.[This is the basic combination. Would you like to try?]\u201cOf course!\u201d[Then, your target will be\u2026\u2026]Her gaze turned to one side as she looked around before grinning.[Alright. Let\u2019s try with those orcs.]Behind the tree, two grunting orcs were approaching.Their skin was gray, their noses were flat like a pig\u2019s, and they had abnormally developed molars protruding from their mouths.Gray Orcs. Monsters that ruled the nearby mountain range.They were a threat that, at one time, drove Arnish to the brink of collapse.\u2018An actual fight all of a sudden, huh?\u2019Still, since the stage was already set, there was no reason for him not to do it. Simon connected to the thoughts of the two corpse spiders, and the two orcs detected Simon, running toward him.\u2018Shoot the tail web.\u2019The two corpse spiders turned and shot their webs into the tree opposite to the orcs running.\u2018Lift up your body and dash!\u2019Dash.Tap.The corpse spiders moved like a pendulum. However, it might have been too uncontrolled. They narrowly missed the running orcs.[Oh, that was close!]Elizabeth, who stood in front of Simon, readied her jet-black. But Simon grabbed her by the shoulder as she was about to step in and sent her behind him.\u2018Shoot!\u2019Thwip! Thwip!Cross operation. He connected to the thoughts of the spiders on the other side and sealed the movement of the orcs by shooting webs at them.[Ugh! Guuuurgh!]The orcs struggled to break free from the sticky web.At the same time, the spiders that had flown to the end of the pendulum movement returned from the opposite direction and attacked the backs of the two orcs. They stuck their fangs into the orcs\u2019 necks, and the orcs fell down screaming.\u201cIt worked!\u201dThe flinching orcs eventually stopped moving due to the spread of poison.[Awesome! Your control is quite good already.]\u201cThis is basic.\u201d[Ugh!![Ugurgh!]It was then. Perhaps there was an Orc village nearby, but gray orcs kept appearing from the forest.\u201cThere are quite a few of them.\u201d[I believe it\u2019s a good situation to showcase the power of the spider troops.][Oh, is it a gith?! Let me out too, Boy!]Said Pier\u2019s clone attached to Simon\u2019s school uniform. When Simon opened the subspace, Pier and his skeleton troops rushed out.\u201cSince we\u2019ve come this far, why don\u2019t we earn the 500 gold?\u201d[What?]\u201cLet\u2019s wipe out all the orc villages in this mountain range and return to Kizen.\u201dPier grinned as if he had been waiting for those very words.[And replenish the forces of Legion with their corpses!][That sounds interesting.]You get to train, and you get to replenish your troops. This was why being a Necromancer was good.[Oiiiink!]The orcs who had lost their comrades came running with a terrifying force.Pier and Elizabeth prepared to fight, and the skeletons and the corpse spiders also made menacing sounds, awaiting orders.\u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201dSimon\u2019s face formed a toothy grin.Finally, for the first time, the stage was set to properly reveal the strength of the Legion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here I go!]\u201cElizabeth, lead 10 corpse spiders and block the escape route behind the village.\u201d[As you wish.]Simon felt refreshed here.Leading a large army of undead, skillfully commanding them, reading the whole game, understanding the opponent\u2019s movements, and being a commander who finally achieved victory.So this was\u2026\u2018Necromancy.\u2019Looking at the sight of the orc village burning under the Legion\u2018s siege, Simon\u2019s heart raced.Finally, after all the battles were over, Simon entered the village.Elizabeth bowed her head politely, and Pier was chuckling, his sword stabbed in the ground.[We were able to win thanks to your good orders, Commander.]\u201cWell, you guys did all the work, Eliza and Pier.\u201dAt that moment, Elizabeth opened her eyes.[Wh-What did you say just now!]\u201cH-Hm? That you guys did all the work?\u201d[After that!]\u201cEliza?\u201d[Ahh\u2026\u2026\u2026!]She closed her eyes and put her hands together.[So you\u2019re finally giving me a nickname! I feel like I\u2019m on cloud nine!! We\u2019re so much closer now!]\u2026\u2026Rather than a nickname, he just used it as a codename due to the urgent nature of the battle.Still, he didn\u2019t necessarily have to spoil her fun, so he decided to move on.[Now, it\u2019s time for you to work!]Pier pointed in one direction. The corpses of the gray orcs that died during the battle were piled up like a mountain on one side.[Turn all of them into skeletons! With this, the Legion can become even stronger!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon suddenly felt like he was going to faint.\u201cShould we just burn them?\u201d[You crazy bastard! I\u2019m telling you to turn them into soldiers!]\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t learned that yet.\u201d[That?]\u201cDark magic that raises a corpse.\u201dUntil now, Simon had been assembling and using the \u2018skeleton sets\u2019 sold on the market. Of course, the summoning magic was already drawn inside the skull of the skeleton set.Pier\u2019s ability was also to conscript summoned or natural undead into a legion undead, so raising the corpse right away and turning it into a Legion was out of his capability.[Hah\u2026\u2026 Right. Sometimes I forget that you\u2019re still a first-year student in Kizen.]Said Pier while folding his arms.[Still, don\u2019t we live in times where corpses are money? I think it\u2019s a waste to just throw them away.]In the end, Simon sent a letter to the Lord\u2019s castle and asked him to handle it.Lord Raymond was surprised as soon as he received the message from Simon, so he climbed up to the mountain range on horseback to check the situation himself, coming to Simon\u2019s inn to express his thanks.\u201cThey were really giving us a rough time! On behalf of my territory\u2019s people, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude!\u201dRaymond turned this matter into a formal mission, paid Simon an additional commission, and decided to handle the orcs\u2019 bodies, sending all the profits to Simon.[Kugh! My soldiers\u2026\u2026!]Pier grumbled wistfully, but when Simon said that he would buy new undead with this money, he felt a little better.And the following day, Simon left the inn early.[It\u2019s. Cramped. In. hereeeeee!]\u201cHang in there just a little bit.\u201dAfter shoving Pier, Elizabeth, and about thirty corpse spiders into the subspace, he headed to the meeting point he was first teleported to.When he arrived at the meeting point, he saw a man wearing a black robe and sitting down in the shade of a tree like a corpse.Simon drew closer, but they showed no reaction. So, he took out his student ID and held it toward the man.\u2018That startled me.\u2019The student ID disappeared from Simon\u2019s hand. In an instant, the man who used inspection magic on his student ID jumped up and bowed down at 90 degrees.\u201cI was waiting for you, Simon Polentia.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dSo they were a servant of Kizen after all.Simon smiled, embarrassed, and took his ID back.\u201cThis way, please. I\u2019ll start the guide right now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe saw the servant using dark magic, and after a while, a clear teleportation circle was drawn on the floor.\u201cCongratulations on your safe return. Have a nice day today.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe mission was successful, and he earned a lot of spare money to use in school life too. Simon happily stepped onto the magic circle.\u2018Let\u2019s go back. To Kizen!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After returning to Roke Island with the teleportation circle, Simon arrived safely at the Kizen campus.\u2018Haaaaaah. It\u2019s been a while, Kizen!\u2019He somehow felt butterflies in his stomach as he looked around the familiar school buildings.To think that he\u2019d feel so fond of this place after being away for a few days.Perhaps because he arrived a day earlier, the school was quiet. He could only see a few students passing by, chatting, or sitting on benches and reading books.\u2018The fact that my environment changed is now truly sinking in.\u2019When he was out on a mission, Simon was the only Kizen, and he was treated well by people. But not here. All of the students here were Kizen, and he had to compete fiercely to survive.But now, he was ready. At this point, Simon just wanted to meet his friends quickly and take his next class.[Boy! What are you sentimentalizing about for so long? Let\u2019s hurry and go to the ruins!]\u2018Haha. Alright.\u2019It was then when Simon was about to head towards the Forbidden Forest.\u201cSimonnn!\u201dWhen he turned around at the sound of his name being called, Camibarez was running towards him from a distance, waving her hand.\u201cCami!\u201dSimon also smiled brightly. He hadn\u2019t seen her for a few days, which made him feel happier to see her.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re not hurt! I was worried because you took on a difficult mission.\u201d\u201cI was lucky in many ways.\u201dContrary to Simon, Camibarez chose the strategy of taking on a Roke Island mission and completing it quickly to study at school.\u201cSimon, Simon! Look at this! Tada~\u201dShe turned around to show her back. Adorable bat wings were flapping behind her school uniform.\u201cI got my school uniform mended! Hehe.\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t help but smile, looking at her innocently bragging about her school uniform while smiling.\u201cLooks way better than before.\u201d\u201cRight? Right?\u201d\u201cYeah. By the way, wanna grab a coffee in the cafeteria? It\u2019s on me.\u201d\u201cHm? Ah, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll pay for my own\u2014\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cMy treat. I made a lot of money with the mission.\u201dThen, he showed off the money he earned from the missions to his classmate.Afterward, Simon passed through the main gate and entered the Forbidden Forest after waving to Camibarez, who was going back to the library.[Commander. Who was that woman from a while ago?]\u201cAh! That startled me.\u201dElizabeth came out of the subspace and walked behind Simon without him realizing it.\u201cWe\u2019re just classmates.\u201d[For just a classmate, she had that annoying look when she looked at you, Commander.]Simon\u2019s face stiffened slightly.\u201cYou remember our contract, right? Don\u2019t lay hands on\u2014\u201d[People without your permission. Of course. I\u2019ll quietly wait at the ruins with Pier until you come to see me, Commander.]She was so obedient, to the point that he felt more anxious.She said with a smile,[And since you\u2019re a master and I\u2019m your servant, please speak to me casually. I feel uncomfortable.]\u201cAh, yeah. If you say so\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon scratched his head and nodded.\u201cAnd even though this is the Forbidden Forest, sometimes Keepers and people come and go. I think it\u2019d be better for you to be in the subspace, Eliza.\u201d[If you\u2019re worried about people\u2019s eyes, wouldn\u2019t this work?]She tapped her chest with her fingertips. Then, the wine-colored dress she was wearing turned into a cobweb. It was as if her naked body was covered with cobwebs.\u2018So those weren\u2019t clothes, but cobwebs.\u2019Simon was surprised again. When she touched the web once more, the color and material of the web began to change.A white blouse, a red-tone necktie, a black jacket, a skirt, and shoes. She perfectly reproduced Kizen\u2019s female school uniform.She smiled as she brushed off her fluffy hair.[Are you satisfied?]\u201c\u2026\u2026Certainly. It looks quite completed.\u201d[If you need a messenger to come and pass by Kizen, call me. No surveillance magic can catch me.]Elizabeth specialized in the role of a spy. In addition to changing her appearance, she possessed unique stealth skills that could escape surveillance magic.Therefore, she was the only undead that could go back and forth between the ruins and Kizen. Of course, her spider troops also specialized in ambushes.\u2018It\u2019s a good thing I brought her to Legion. The more I think about it, the more useful she is.\u2019While Simon nodded his head, Elizabeth pulled out more webs and covered her own head. Curious, Simon stood still and watched.[What about this kind of appearance?]\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon freaked out and stepped back. Elizabeth\u2019s body had transformed into Camibarez\u2019.The puppy-like, sweet, innocent smile with the eyes and the fangs unique to the vampires sticking out.[Hmph. Ehem.]Her voice remained the same as Elizabeth\u2019s, but she began to clear her throat.[Kyahak! Kieeegh! Keugh!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe step of clearing her throat was quite messy. Then, after a while, she turned around and said,\u201cSimon, Simon! Look at this! Tada~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dElizabeth was waving the bat wings behind her and speaking in Camibarez\u2019 voice. While blushing and waving his arms wildly, Simon said,\u201cStop! Stop! I\u2019ve seen enough, so just stop!\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201dShe gave an alluring smile.\u201cI think by using this power, I\u2019ll be able to give you a lot of pleasure, Commander.\u201d[Ah, shut up you guys!]Pier\u2019s clone, hanging on Simon\u2019s school uniform, shouted,[Stop playing around! Let\u2019s just go already! The spider bastards keep clinging to my body and whimpering!]\u201cPier\u2019s mad. Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201dThe two started walking again.As though she enjoyed Simon\u2019s embarrassment, Elizabeth still hadn\u2019t changed out of Camibarez\u2019 form.\u201c\u2026\u2026Eliza.\u201d\u201cYes~ Master~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t call me master in Cami\u2019s voice.\u201d[Understood.]She returned to her original voice and chuckled. She was clearly enjoying it.\u201cLet\u2019s just talk about the Legion. We only have about 30 corpse spiders right now, right? How do we increase the number? Do I have to explore the continent and collect more spiders\u2026\u2026?\u201d[Don\u2019t worry. I, the queen spider, just have to lay eggs.]Simon froze.\u201cWh-What\u2026\u2026?\u201d[I just have to lay eggs.]She suddenly blushed and pretended to grab the hem of her skirt with her fingertips.[It\u2019s embarrassing to show someone me laying eggs, but if it\u2019s you, master, I can\u2014]\u201cUwaaaaaah! Agh! Go back to your original form right now! This is an order!\u201dPier\u2019s clone clicked his tongue when he saw the chaos break loose.It was as expected. He knew that Elizabeth would be too much stimulation for Simon right now.In the end, Simon opened the subspace and ordered Elizabeth to go inside. She had a pitiful look on her face, but it didn\u2019t work anymore.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, wait a second.\u201dSimon, whose face had turned red, stiffened up with seriousness.\u201cEliza.\u201d[Yes, Commander?]\u201cCan you perhaps\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter getting lost in his thoughts with his chin on his hand, he spoke in a serious voice.\u201ctransform into a priest, too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Elizabeth will disguise herself as a priest in a high position to approach them and extort some information.[I\u2019m sorry, but if the opponent is a priest, wouldn\u2019t it be revealed quickly that I\u2019m an undead? I heard that priests who use divinity are sensitive to the undead.]\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem. They were using jet-black.\u201dJet-black and divinity were completely exclusive, a person being unable to harbor both.The priest\u2019s unique power of sensing the undead appeared only when they had divinity. But that traitor priest gave up their divinity in order to use jet-black.Even if they found out, it didn\u2019t matter. Pier and the entire Legion would all rush in and attack the priest.Even if it was hard to guarantee victory because the opponent was really at the level of a professor, there would be no problems in at least Pier and Elizabeth running away.[Understood. I\u2019ll start studying the appearance and behavior of upper-class priests.]\u201cYeah, I\u2019m counting on you.\u201dHe set up a trap. They probably wouldn\u2019t come back to the forest, as they were likely currently cautious, but he just hoped that they\u2019d get caught someday.Like that, Simon released the undead in the ruins and returned to Kizen.* * *A new life in Kizen began again after the mission period was over.When Simon entered the lecture room after a long time, the atmosphere was several times brighter and more cheerful than usual. Laughter broke loose from everywhere, and their chats wouldn\u2019t stop.Everyone was busy trying to share the stories they had from their missions, and it seemed that today wouldn\u2019t be enough to exhaust this topic.\u2018Are the others not here yet?\u2019While going to school together, Rick complained about a sudden diarrhea and rushed to the bathroom, and Simon arrived in the lecture room on his own. As he looked around for a seat, he saw a familiar face.\u201cMeilyn!\u201dWhile babbling with two female students, she suddenly blushed when she found Simon and quickly hid something behind her back. Meilyn got angry, telling them to stop it when the two female students poked her arm while giggling.\u201cSomething up?\u201dAs Simon approached, Meilyn flinched and took a step back. The girls also greeted Simon warmly and looked at Meilyn.\u201cWell then, we might be a hindrance, so we\u2019ll be leaving now~\u201d\u201cOhohoho!\u201d\u201cHey!! I\u2019m gonna kill you guys, for real!\u201dThey ran to another place while laughing. After raising her head and slightly glaring at Simon, Meilyn cleared her throat.\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Or are you just dull or something?\u201dShe gave a small sigh and held out what she was hiding on her back.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat she readily offered was a carrot cake packed in a pretty wrapper. Simon blinked.\u201cAre you giving it to me?\u201d\u201cD-Don\u2019t get me wrong! Please! I\u2019m giving it to you because we\u2019re in the same group!\u201dShe handed the cake over to Simon as if dumping it on him and pulled her arms back. Then, she turned away and fanned her flushing face with her hand.\u201cThank you. But what\u2019s up with this gift all of a sudden? It\u2019s not even my birthday today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe looked at Simon with an expression asking if he really didn\u2019t know.\u201cToday is a cake day.\u201d\u201cCake day?\u201d\u201cYeah! A day where women give men a cake!\u201dSimon\u2019s brain started spinning fast. He has never heard of a day called Cake Day.When it came to anniversaries at Les Hill, there was only Thanksgiving, Treats-for-Goats Day, Weed-Plucking Day, and such. Maybe it could be the city\u2019s culture.And judging from Meilyn\u2019s reaction, not knowing this would be dumb and bumpkin-like, so it\u2019d be wise to just go with it and not be stupid.After understanding the situation with the train of thought, Simon smiled.\u201cSo you remembered. Thanks, Meilyn.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer hand that she was using to fan herself became faster.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I remembered! I\u2019m giving it just because I pity you, got it? Pity! If you and Rick don\u2019t even get any from the members of the same group, then that\u2019s ove\u2014\u201d\u201cHello~ Simon!\u201d\u201cHere! It\u2019s a lemon cake!\u201d\u201cMine\u2019s a tea cake! Thank you for teaching me the stance in the Combat Magic class last time!\u201dThey placed their cakes one by one on the top of Meilyn\u2019s cake. Simon felt a little stunned, but then said with a bright smile,\u201cThank you, everyone! I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dThe girls\u2019 faces all of a sudden turned red.\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy this.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dA slightly awkward and strange atmosphere flew. Then, the girls waved their hands and hurriedly left for another place.\u201c\u2026\u2026P-Pretty good.\u201d\u201cBut everyone\u2019s, including mine, was nothing but appreciation, right?

In her hand was a box with a huge cake.\u201cAh, Cami.\u201dShe took a deep breath after standing in front of Simon. Then, she strained her eyes and held out her cake.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon! I-I-I\u2019ve been causing a lot of trouble until now, Th-Thank you! And let\u2019s get along well for the rest of this semester!!\u201dThen, she bent over at the waist and held out the huge cake.\u2018I mean, what in the world is a cake day? She\u2019s going this far for me?\u2019Simon was feeling somewhat touched. Meilyn\u2019s eyes widened along with Simon\u2019s when she came up beside Simon and glanced at it.\u201cWoah! A hand-made cake? That\u2019s awesome\u2026\u2026\u201dCamibarez shook her head as she reddened even more after hearing those words.\u201cN-No! It\u2019s not hand-made! I just bought it from Rochest\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCami.\u201dSimon came over and took out a handkerchief from his pocket.Then, he wiped the whipped cream off the side of her cheek.\u201cHold on. There\u2019s something on your face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dHer face went as red as it could. She disappeared from the lecture room like she was running away as soon as she handed her cake to Simon.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026 You\u2026 For real\u2026\u201dMeilyn sighed as she touched her forehead.After those short happenings, Simon sat down and neatly laid the cakes onto his desk.Then, he let out a breath and slowly looked around.Before he realized it, the classroom was filled with colorful cakes, and a pinkish atmosphere was flowing between the men and women exchanging cakes.It turned out that the lively atmosphere Simon first felt was the joy they\u2019ve seen each other after the mission, plus the power of Cake Day.And at the corner of the lecture room, you could see Hector.Sitting with his legs wide open, he had a very annoyed face, but contrary to the intimidating expression on his face, he was wearing a funny party hat. In front of his desk was a mountain of cake boxes.\u201cH-Hello, Hector!\u201dThen a girl approached him cautiously. She was even from another class.\u201cI-I prepared this for you\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Just put it anywhere and get lost.\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaah!\u201dShe added another cake on top of the mountain of cakes and ran out of the lecture room while blushing.Simon found it amusing to watch Hector annoyedly scratching his head without being able to get angry.\u2018It must be tough for him.\u2019It was when Simon was taking out his textbook with such thoughts in mind.\u201cHello~ Simon.\u201dSimon raised his head.\u201cAh, class president.\u201dJamie Victoria.After doing the greetings as the class representative in Poisonous Alchemy, she was the student who got given the title of class president by the Class A students.She had a slender impression with her short green hair, which made it hard to tell if she was a girl or a pretty boy when just looking at her face.\u201cAmong cheese, vanilla, and cinnamon, which one do you prefer?\u201dShe asked while rummaging through the sack she was carrying on her back.\u201cCinnamon for me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh! This wasn\u2019t so favored. Thank you for choosing it!\u201dShe said as she held out a cupcake box to Simon. Simon asked while thanking her,\u201cAre you giving them to all the boys in Class A?\u201d\u201cYeah! To get along well for a semester, in a sense. Then, see ya!\u201dShe winked and went to another place. The two poor boys who had been sitting right behind Simon without a single cake had their eyes twinkling as if they had seen a savior as Jamie approached.\u201cSimon, you\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn made a profound face after sitting next to Simon with her things unpacked.\u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about Cake Day, did you?\u201dSimon\u2019s shoulders flinched. She shook her head after being convinced by Simon\u2019s reaction.\u201cI\u2019m telling you. This is school, a school. If you don\u2019t wanna be neglected by your peers, you\u2019d better be familiar with such basic anniversaries and trends.\u201dShe had a point.But other than that\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s another anniversary like this?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cThe next one would probably be a day a man gives something to a woman. What kind of day is it?\u201dMeilyn smirked.\u201cAccessories Day.\u201dSimon let out a feigned smile.\u201c\u2026\u2026How unfair.\u201d\u201cHey, do you think the girls would want real accessories with jewels in return for a cake if they had a conscience? It\u2019s just giving and receiving something like toys.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dShe flashed the whites of her teeth.\u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t stop any boys who wanted to give me some, though~\u201d\u2026\u2026The world wasn\u2019t fair after all.* * *After the unsettled class preparation time was over, the first class at Kizen finally started. The first class was Jane\u2019s Beginner Dark Magic.\u201cIt was reported that all Class A students returned to Kizen safely. I find that gratifying as professor-in-charge.Jane looked around the students and continued.\u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s an important announcement.\u201dShe received a new document from her assistant and read it.\u201cYes. The Duel Evaluation will start this week.\u201dAh\u2026Burdened voices broke loose from everywhere. You could feel the lively atmosphere from Cake Day freezing up.Regardless of that, Jane continued her explanation.\u201cThe Duel Evaluation will be conducted throughout the first semester. The rules are simple. You\u2019ll battle one-on-one with your peers. Not just Class A, but till the farthest Class N. All 14 classes will become competitors.\u201dShe approached the blackboard and drew a simple picture in chalk.\u201cThe winner moves to the upper squad, and the loser moves to the lower squad.\u201dUpper Squad 30%Middle Squad 30%Lower squad 30%Lowest squad 10%\u201cThe squads will be updated every week. All students who remain in the Lowest Squad by the end of the 1st semester\u2026\u201dShe said coldly as she turned towards the students,\u201cWill be expelled.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, each squad has different Duel Evaluation points. You get more points for losing in a match of a higher squad than winning in a lower squad. Everyone, please take on the challenge with the goal of advancing to the upper squad.\u201dShe placed down the chalk in her hand and turned to the students.\u201cHere\u2019s a question. Can anyone tell me the difference between the monster battle we had last time and this person-to-person battle?\u201dThere was an arm that rose faster than anyone else at that question.\u201cJamie Victoria.\u201d\u201cYes, Professor! This is Jamie Victoria speaking! In monster battles, we\u2019re in a position to attack with a strategy, but in a person-to-person battle, there\u2019s a difference, since the opponent could have a strategy for us too!\u201dJamie nodded and turned to the other student who raised their hand.\u201cHector Moore.\u201dThis time, Hector, who had raised his hand, stood up. It felt like a huge hill was rising.\u201cUnlike monster battles, the range of dark magic used in person-to-person battles is limited.\u201d\u201cCould you please explain in detail?\u201d\u201cSkills that take a long time to cast, skills with clear trajectories or slow ejection speed, and installation trap-type magic circles are difficult to use in person-to-person combat, so their use is limited. Similarly\u2026\u201dHector\u2019s eyes moved. His gaze was on Simon, who was seated far from him.\u201cThe summoning magic of Summoning studies isn\u2019t effective in person-to-person battles, since the way to counter them is clear. The opponent can ignore the summons and attack the caster directly.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dJane gestured, and Hector bowed his head politely, sitting down.\u201cThe important details have almost all been said. In fact, there are dozens or hundreds of differences between monster battles and person-to-person battles. Well then. Can anyone explain why I\u2019m explaining such obvious things?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe surroundings became as silent as a grave.\u201cFrom this week on, you have to change how you think.\u201dJane tapped her forehead with her finger.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be immersed in the afterglow of the Cyclops anymore. Loosen the screw on your head and twist your lifestyle and notions. It\u2019s not like someone will agonize on your behalf. As you take the class, keep thinking about how you\u2019ll battle your schoolmates with the cards you have.\u201d\u201cYes, Professor!\u201dThe students responded vigorously.\u201cAnd.\u201dThe corners of Jane\u2019s lips rose.Simon felt a shiver running down his spine while listening to her.How could a person have such a terrifying smile?\u201cI\u2019m the Vice-President of Kizen, but I think I did my best as a professor-in-charge of Class A. Class A is the only one out of the 14 classes in the first year that simulated with Avalon and did an actual battle against a Cyclops.\u201dSimon nodded. He was very grateful for her letting them experience such a great experience.But why was she all of a sudden telling us this\u2026\u2026?\u201cLet me be clear. I can\u2019t imagine another class being on top of the Class A that I\u2019m in charge of.\u201dSparks flashed in the eyes of Jane, someone who always had a cold impression.\u201cA so-called Vice-President took charge of first-year students. I believe you guys won\u2019t disgrace me.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Haha. So that\u2019s what it meant.\u2019Although the professors didn\u2019t really make it obvious, in fact, they were quite sensitive to the grades of their classes.The Duel Evaluation in particular was a system in which students from Class A to Class N competed, and you could immediately see the results on which classes did well and which classes didn\u2019t.\u201cProfessor Jane!!\u201dIt was then. Rick, who was sitting next to Simon, got up from his seat with an excited face.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it! We\u2019ll do our best so you can roam around with confidence, Professor!\u201dMeilyn got startled and pulled at the hem of his clothes.\u201cHey! Hey! Sit down! Why the hell are you interfering?!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go! Go Class A!!\u201dLoud laughter broke loose from everywhere.Meanwhile, some male students responded to Rick\u2019s words and shouted as though their fighting spirit was on fire.\u201cDid you hear that? Go Class A, huh?\u201d\u201cOur students are soo cuute.\u201dThe assistant teachers exchanged whispers and giggled.Because they\u2019d always been following Jane and dealing with the third-year students\u2019 precocious behavior, dealing with first-year students this year felt fresh.Jane looked at Rick with an expressionless face.\u201cRick Hayward.\u201d\u201cYes, Professor!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about you the most.\u201dWahahahahahaha!This time, the whole class burst into laughter. Rick sat down out of belated embarrassment while scratching his head.\u201cAh, for real\u2026 I fucking hate it. You\u2019re really embarrassing.\u201dMeilyn sitting next to him also buried her face in her hands.\u201cThat being said, to give you some advice, Rick Hayward\u2019s enchantments are pretty good. However, the question is how to make the enchanted weapon reach the opponent. If the opponent is a Combat Magic aspirant, you might stand a chance, but if you meet a Hemomancy aspirant who specializes in ranged attacks, you\u2019ll fall without being able to lift a finger.\u201dShe had a good point, so Rick nodded with a firm face.\u201cYou should all think about your strengths and weaknesses, and what needs to be supplemented for a person-to-person battle.\u201d\u201cYes Ma\u2019am!\u201dAfter coming down from the stage, Jane signaled to the assistants. The assistant teachers began to move busily.\u201cThen, let\u2019s move.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The place where Class A headed was the indoor training room in the building next door.The reason Jane brought the students here was simple.\u201cStarting now, you\u2019ll have some time to freely train and think about what kind of dark magic to use in a person-to-person battle. The assistant teachers will roam around, so ask them if you have any questions.\u201dAfter hearing the words \u2018freely train\u2019, the students dispersed as if they were waiting for it.Some students did image training while using dark magic, and some students were sitting down and writing damage tables.If desired, a mock duel between the students could be performed too. A protective vest similar to that used in the Cyclops battle was being lent out by the assistant teachers.And on the other hand, Simon was leaning against the wall agonizing about the topic Hector had brought up.-\u201cThe summoning magic of Summoning studies isn\u2019t effective in person-to-person battles, since the way to counter them is clear. The opponent can ignore the summons and attack the caster directly.\u201dAs he said, the opponent would stubbornly target Simon alone. Moreover, he was unsure whether the slow skeletons could catch up with the students running around with jet-black.Crumble!As Simon\u2019s agony deepened, a skeleton suddenly fell to his side.\u201cAhh! I\u2019m sorry! Did I startle you?\u201dA bowl-haired male student rushed over and started putting the bone fragments into the box. Simon also squatted down and picked up the bones.\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cAh, thanks!\u201dThe male student glanced at Simon\u2019s face. At first, he looked a little surprised, but then he gave a smile full of joy.\u201cYou\u2019re Simon Polentia, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHis eyes shone.\u201cMy name is Toto Amori! I was really, really impressed with your Cyclops battle last time! I\u2019m also a Summoning aspirant, and you had something that made my heart race!\u201dSimon smiled. He stood up after putting all the skeleton\u2019s bones in the box.\u201cAre you planning to use this skeleton in the Duel Evaluation?\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dToto scratched the side of his head and smiled timidly.\u201cActually, I have no choice. I\u2019m only good at Summoning, and I got into Kizen thanks to it. I\u2019m pretty bad at other subjects, you see.\u201dHaving said that, Toto looked up at Simon.\u201cI envy you, Simon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good at Combat Magic. And you seem to be quite talented with Curses too\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon blinked.\u201cI\u2019m also a Summoning aspirant just like you, though?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m envious. If you want to survive as a Summoning aspirant, you have to do well in subjects that are advantageous to person-to-person combat such as Combat Magic or Curses.\u201dSimon folded his arms.\u201cSo that means, Summoning isn\u2019t so good for person-to-person combat.\u201d\u201cYeah. It can\u2019t be helped in the beginning. After all, Summoning requires more time.\u201dAt that moment, a female student who seemed to be Toto\u2019s groupmate waved her hand. Toto also waved to her and said,\u201cThen, I\u2019ll get going.\u201d\u201cGood luck.\u201dSimon got lost in his thoughts while looking at Toto as he got far away.\u2018Summoning is weak in person-to-person combat, huh?\u2019Of course, it\u2019d be a different story if he used the Legion and wiped the opponents out, but that\u2019d be impossible. Simon could only use his three summon-type skeletons in the Duel Evaluation.Even after Toto had left, Simon leaned his back against the wall and pondered over and over again.\u201cOh my. It looks like you have a lot of thoughts~\u201dPerhaps she was concerned about Simon, but this time, an assistant teacher approached with a smile.Simon quickly bowed his head and said, \u201cHello,\u201d surprised.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I spent almost 2 years at Kizen too, so you can ask me anything.\u201d\u201cAh, uhm\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon gave an awkward smile and scratched his head.\u201cI\u2019m just wondering about what style to fight with in the person-to-person battles.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201dShe folded her arms.\u201cIn my experience, at times like this, it\u2019s best to try it yourself rather than worrying about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dShe handed him the protective vest.\u201cPut it on. I\u2019ll spar with you myself.\u201dSuddenly, Simon happened to have a mock duel with an assistant. The two went to a large space so that other students wouldn\u2019t be disturbed and stood facing each other.\u201cYou can check the barrier gauge with the blue scale on the vest. Can you see it?\u201d\u201cYes, I can.\u201dBattling against an assistant teacher out of the blue.Simon was stunned, yet nervous at the same time.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be too nervous. I\u2019ll only use dark magic at the level of a first-year student. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen, here I go!\u201dShe spread her palms out. Jet-black rose like a haze and formed four magic circles in the air.Simon looked at her with his eyes lit up.\u2018A jet-black arrow.\u2019He learned it in the Mechanics of Jet-Black class.One of the most basic means of attack with jet-black. It was a common technique that most of the first-years used as a long-distance poking.\u2018So she really is going against me at the level of a normal first-year student.\u2019As the assistant teacher opened her arms, three jet-black arrows flew in. Simon, who took his stance, quickly checked the trajectories of the projectiles, and jumped back.Pssshhhk!Three arrows pierced the floor.\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019And the one remaining arrow was flying in the exact direction of Simon\u2019s jump.It was impossible to suddenly change the direction of the jump. Simon clenched his teeth and stretched his hand out.Phew!A short sword protruded from the subspace on the floor. He grabbed it and swung, parrying the jet-black arrow.\u201cOh! Pretty good~\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my turn this time!\u201dThree skeletons came out of the subspace and dashed towards the assistant teacher. She cast another jet-black arrow and fired it, and Simon strained his eyes.\u2018Dodge to your right!\u2019Whish! Whish!Skeletons moved nimbly. One was hit by her, and the other two managed to dodge and narrow the distance with her.\u201cHmm~\u201dShe clenched her fist. Her seemingly soft fists were dyed slightly black.Swing!She swung her fist after dodging the skeleton\u2019s spear by bending her head back.When she hit the center of the skeleton\u2019s body, bones were scattered in all directions with a band. She then lowered her stance and smashed the skull of a skeleton approaching from behind with her elbow.\u2018Ah!\u2019\u201cAre you really supposed to space out like that?\u201dClunk!Simon\u2019s stomach was bent backward. Before he realized it, some black streak of light pierced through his chest.\u2018Crap!\u2019An Exhaust curse!His body suddenly became heavy.\u2018I was careless. I could\u2019ve dodged it!\u201dThe assistant teacher used one hand to draw Simon\u2019s attention seamlessly while dealing with the skeleton, and prepared an Exhaust with the other hand hidden behind her.She also fired it right at the moment where Simon took mental damage from his skeleton getting smashed.\u2018What she\u2019s using are just basics\u2026\u2026 but her skills are way different!\u2019Simon clenched his teeth.\u201cNow~ I took down the summons and also placed an Exhaust. Isn\u2019t this a great chance to take down the summoner?\u201dShe came running to Simon while even relaxedly narrating. Simon sent out three skeletons from the subspace again.\u2018Stop her!\u2019The moment when the distance between the skeletons and her was narrowing\u2026Woooooosh!Jet-black spurt from both of her legs like geysers, leaping over the skeleton in an instant.\u2018Jet-Black Stepping from Combat Magic!\u2019After leaping over the skeleton, she kicked into the air and came down towards the caster, Simon.\u201cIt won\u2019t be painful since you have the barrier!\u201dHer fist thrusted down at a tremendous speed.Simon\u2019s eyes shone. Folding his shoulder toward his chest, he made the fist roll flow off of him like water.\u2018Hmph.\u2019She knew from the start that this student was skilled in Combat Magic.The assistant smirked and gently spread her left hand. The magic circle of a Jet-Black Arrow drawn on the palm was aimed towards Simon\u2019s head.\u2018This is the end\u2026\u2026!\u2019At that moment, she felt goosebumps rise up from all over her body.Simon\u2019s right shoulder wasn\u2019t folded, but turned excessively, and at the same time, the heel of his right foot was lifted, and his left foot was approaching from the opposite angle.\u2018It\u2019s not a guard, but\u2026\u2026!\u2019The tip of his left foot, visible in her sight, became a black flash of unfathomable speed and swept over her face.\u2018A spinning kick!\u2019Whiiiiiiiiiiish!Simon\u2019s legs passed through her face while drawing a savage trajectory.A shockwave spread around, and the students who were practicing nearby looked at the two in surprise.Simon, who performed the kick, was also surprised.\u2018I thought it went in cleanly, but my leg just passed through her head?\u2019The two paused for a moment, then quickly fell apart.\u201cOh, uhm\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe assistant teacher bowed her head and apologized.\u201cI said that I\u2019d only use basic dark magic, but I ended up using my major skill, Ethereal Form. Ahaha\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s stop the mock battle here.\u201d\u201cThank you, assistant teacher.\u201dAnd at this time, the assistant teacher was looking at Simon like she\u2019d seen a ghost.\u2018What is this kid\u2026\u2026? He\u2019s scary.\u2019Wouldn\u2019t it have been a straight trip to the underworld\u00a0 if she got struck without a vest?The assistant teacher swallowed down her saliva.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The assistant teacher stretched her palms.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I insisted on a mock duel. People like you who don\u2019t know their talents can eventually find the answer by pushing themselves to the limit. You know what you depend on in the most dangerous and critical moments.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn your case, you started with the Summoning with your own will, right? However, when you started to get cornered, you started using Combat Magic without any hesitation. You do seem to have a talent for it too. Is there even a need for you to think more?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon felt like he was stripped naked.To answer her with, \u2018I simply used combat magic because you got close to me\u2019\u2026 Simon was preparing for close combat after finishing his jet-black body enhancement while sending out three skeletons. It was almost like an instinctive movement.\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to give an answer right away. Think about it slowly~\u201d\u201cThank you, assistant teacher.\u201dAfter Simon left, the assistant teacher let out an internal sigh of relief.Just then, from afar, she saw her senior assistant teacher guiding a student.The senior was wearing a protective vest, and a student in the same protective vest was lying on the floor with a blank expression on their face. It looked like they had also done a mock duel.The student who listened to her advice also thanked her and left. Now was her chance.\u201cUwaaaah! Big sis!\u201dThe assistant teacher ran to the senior and jumped into her arms.\u201cI was so scared!\u201dThe senior pushed away from the junior, talking with a lisp and making a fuss while frowning.\u201cBecause you started off the duel guidance, all the students are asking for a mock duel! How burdensome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sniffle.\u201d\u201cOther than that, what\u2019s so scary?\u201dThe assistant teacher reached out and pointed at Simon as though complaining to her mother. Simon was in the corner by himself, lost in his thoughts.\u201cAh, Simon, the Special Admission No.1\u201d\u201cI thought he\u2019s just a cutesy one, but he\u2019s so scary. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever felt my heart sink when up against a kid.\u201dShe folded her arms as she pushed away from her whining, immature junior.\u201cSo, what kind of guidance did you give to him?\u201cI asked in a roundabout way why the hell are he was obsessed with Summoning when he\u2019s fucking good at Combat Magic, and why doesn\u2019t he focus on that? Something like that.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCertainly, with some of the Summoning magic learned in the early part of the first-year, they\u2019d inevitably be falling behind in the Duel Evaluation.There were several subjects that were advantageous in the early Duel Evaluation, and typically, they were Curses or Combat Magic. Summoning and Necromancy were subjects that needed a little more time.\u2018Is he thinking because he\u2019s a Summoning aspirant? But then again, now\u2019s the only time when you can have those kinds of posh-person problems.\u2019There was no use telling him about it yet. She thought that, if he fell into a lower squad and became more desperate, his mind would change.\u2018Or if not\u2026 then like a genius\u2026\u2026\u2019She thought of Simon fighting the Cyclops for a moment in her head.\u2018He might come up with a new method.\u2019* * *After the Mock duel with the assistant teacher, Simon felt that his mind had become more complicated. It feels like two different thoughts were clashing with each other.But if there was one thing that became clear\u2026\u2018Skeletons aren\u2019t enough in this Duel Evaluation.\u2019He slowly recalled the duel with the assistant teacher.To be honest, the skeletons weren\u2019t any help. Rather, they were used against him by the opponent as a means to set\u00a0 a curse on Simon.He needed to change. In order to survive here, he had to constantly change and grow.It was a moment when Simon was assigned with a new task.\u201cSimon!\u201dSimon, who\u2019d been agonizing deeply, raised his head.Camibarez was approaching while waving with a bright smile. Rick and Meilyn followed from behind, side by side, quarreling as if something had happened again.\u201cHeh heh. How come you couldn\u2019t even land a single blow?\u201dMeilyn teased him by sticking out her tongue, and Rick ground his teeth with a frustrated face.\u201cAh, I just went easy on you because you\u2019re a girl!\u201d\u201cYeah right~ You\u2019re nothing but a guy who couldn\u2019t land a blow~\u201dBefore Rick could rebut anything, Meilyn chuckled and ran to Simon\u2019s back.\u201cBy the way, Simon, you said you had something to think about by yourself, but you were suddenly fighting with the assistant teacher.\u201d\u201cYeah. Somehow it just happened.\u201d\u201cDid you win?\u201dSimon awkwardly smiled and scratched his head.\u201cHow can I beat an assistant teacher?\u201dWhile saying that, Simon\u2019s eyes turned to the assistant teacher.At the same time, she was also looking at Simon, but when their eyes met, she could be seen running away to someplace else.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019Simon tilted his head.\u201cAh~ By the way, isn\u2019t this Duel Evaluation too stressful?\u201dSaid Rick while scratching his head.\u201cNot all Necromancers are fighters. There are scholars and researchers. Even if it\u2019s a long-standing tradition, this is too dumb.\u201dCamibarez nodded timidly, as though agreeing with him. On the other hand, Meilyn smiled with half-lidded eyes.\u201cIt must be stressful because you\u2019re weak.\u201d\u201cI said I went easy on you a while ago!\u201dMeilyn snorted.\u201cThis is my opinion, but even if you\u2019re a scholar or whatever, if you\u2019re ranked in the bottom 10% of combat ability, you simply don\u2019t have the skills, disqualifying you as a Necromancer of Kizen.\u201dAt those words, you could see Camibarez\u2019 head falling sullenly. The wings fluttering behind her also drooped.\u201cAh!\u201dBelatedly being conscious of Camibarez, Meilyn approached while sweating profusely.\u201cN-No! I\u2019m not saying you are! You\u2019re a vampire, and you\u2019re from that great Ursula family!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m\u2026\u2026 not that confident in fighting.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll take responsibility and train you!\u201dWhile the two girls chatted, Rick sighed deeply and came to Simon\u2019s side.\u201cBut it must be good for you, since you\u2019re not burdened by the Duel Evaluation.\u201d\u201cNah. I\u2019m also worried.\u201d\u201cHehe. Really? As I roamed around a bit, everyone seemed like they definitely wanted to avoid dueling with y\u2014\u201dAt that moment, Simon\u2019s eyes lit up. As his right hand went up next to his head, something flew in and slammed into his hand.Poooow!\u201cHuff!\u201dRick gasped in surprise. Dust was scattered all around because of how strong it flew in.Simon glanced to the side to see it. It was a protective vest.Step. Step.\u201cSimon Polentia.\u201dHector came. Behind him were his faction members, giggling while following him like bodyguards.\u201cWear it. Let\u2019s fight.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter letting out a small sigh, Simon adjusted his grip on the vest.And\u2026Pooooooooooow!The vest flew at a tremendous speed and hit Hector\u2019s hand this time.He barely reached out and caught it, but beads of sweat fell from Hector\u2019s forehead.\u201cGet lost. I don\u2019t feel like giving you attention right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026This bastard!\u201dHector\u2019s face turned red. Veins spurted from his neck, and his fists were stained with jet-black.Enraged, he strode closer, and Simon also raised his head without avoiding him.\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Hector.\u201dAt that moment, Meilyn jumped in and stood between Simon and Hector.\u201c\u2026\u2026Know when to interfere, Ivory Tower.\u2019Coldly said Hector.\u201cYou\u2019re not even a kid anymore. Why are you doing this? If you keep doing these kinds of asshole moves, I\u2019m going to call the professor.\u201dHector\u2019s lips trembled in anger for being interrupted before mumbling,\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but an underling of Serene.\u201dThe atmosphere instantly turned cold. Rick opened his eyes wide, Camibarez\u2019 face turned pale, and the faction members flinched, turning to Hector.And above all, Meilyn flipped out. The Dark Flare magic circle was spreading out across her palm.\u2018That\u2019s dangerous!\u2019Hector wasn\u2019t wearing any vest, and the student protection period had already ended. Besides, if she cast an attack spell against a defenseless Hector during class, it wouldn\u2019t end with just disciplinary action.Simon quickly ran toward her. Hector stood still, smirking as if telling her to do it if she could.\u201cStop.\u201dSimon, Meilyn, and Hector paused at the same time.Before anyone knew it, the assistant teacher came in-between them and smiled.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dThey approached so fast that no one could notice them. In the midst of this, Simon quickly covered Meilyn\u2019s palm, and Hector bowed politely.\u201cNothing, assistant teacher. We\u2019re sorry to bother you.\u201dHector was a tyrant among students, but from the point of view of professors and assistant teachers, he had a strong image as a respectful and polite student.Hector turned his back and muttered, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d His followers glanced at the assistant teacher and Hector before quickly following after Hector.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dThe assistant teacher turned to Meilyn. Meilyn briefly paused, then quickly lowered her head.\u201cHector, Meilyn. I\u2019m warning both of you, be careful. You just almost did what Professor Jane hates the most.\u201dFortunately, the assistant left without making a fuss. Rick let out a deep sigh as the suffocating atmosphere loosened up.\u201cAh~ I want to fucking smash in Hector\u2019s head. Like, just once, for real. That crazy bastard.\u201d\u201cMeilyn! Are you alright?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah. I\u2019m fine, Cami.\u201dShe said while taking a deep breath,\u201cI just\u2026 uhm\u2026\u2026 Lost my composure there a little.\u201d\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like just a little\u2026\u2019Meilyn raised her head and said,\u201cAnd you.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, so could you please let me go already?\u201dSimon was still holding her hand. Simon nodded his head and let go of her hand as if nothing had happened.\u201cSigh\u2026 For goodness sake.\u201dShe approached and grabbed Simon\u2019s hand with both hands, turning it so that the palm of his hand could be seen.\u201cYou\u2019re really nuts, aren\u2019t you? It was a Dark Flare magic circle, and you just grabbed it with your bare hands?\u201dSimon just smiled bashfully. Meilyn\u2019s face stiffened and she grabbed Simon\u2019s wrist.\u201cI\u2019m gonna take him to the infirmary for a while.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Take care!\u201d* * *They went to the infirmary and received treatment. Thankfully, it was just a minor burn.After some ointment and a bandage was applied, the two came down to the training room again.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWhy did you cover my palm?\u201dSimon shrugged.\u201cYou\u2019re asking something obvious. If the assistant teacher found out that you were trying to use magic, you\u2019d be in trouble.\u201dShe cleared her throat.\u201cThan\u2014\u201d\u201cThank you, Meilyn.\u201dThe two of them spoke at the same time. She turned her head away.\u201cFor stepping in, stopping me and Hector from fighting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd then you almost had a fight with Hector, but this time I stopped you, so I guess that makes us even now.\u201dSimon giggled, but Meilyn had a very complicated expression on her face.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with you, Simon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too kind. Do you know that? It feels creepy that you\u2019re being careful. However\u2026\u201dShe marched over and grabbed Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIt won\u2019t work this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThen she took a deep breath, closing her eyes as though determined, and shouted,\u201cT-H-A-N-K\u00a0 Y-O-U!\u201dAfter shouting that, she ran to the training room, as if running away.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRecovering from being stunned momentarily, Simon giggled.[Like father, like son.]Pier\u2019s clone clicked his tongue.Simon pressed his finger against the clone\u2019s lips to signal him to be quiet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next class started right after the 1st ended.Today, Class A had four two-hour classes scheduled, and the second class was Necromancy.\u201cWith Spirit! Let\u2019s give a shout of concentration and start off today tooooooo!\u201dShouting loudly in the middle of the classroom was a man named Umbra Warframe.As a unique feature, his body was a bit more blurry than usual, and his legs were nowhere to be seen, leaving him floating in the air like a ghost.Believe it or not, apparently, he often went back and forth between the real world and the spirit realm, being too absorbed in it, and eventually became like that. Then, he wore a lifelike wolf mask on his face.Because of how lifelike it was, rumors circulated among students that it was his real face, and that Umbra was a mixed-blood werewolf.Necromancy taught by Umbra was the study of the body of the soul called \u2018Spirit\u2019. Everyone thought it\u2019d be a very delicate and silent class, but they were completely mistaken.\u201cYou lack the guts! Your mind is completely rotten! Why are you already deciding that you can\u2019t do it! Come on! Raise your arms!\u201dUmbra was a passionate professor. Contrary to his limp, ghostly body, he was full of strength and energy.Simon woke up more than once to Umbra\u2019s explosive voice when he was trying to concentrate to feel the Spirit.A student once asked,\u201cProfessor! No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t feel the Spirit. What should I do?\u201dUmbra answered,\u201cFeel it! Don\u2019t think that you can\u2019t! Feel it! Just feel it! You\u2019re not trying hard enough! With all your strength and heart! Pour your energy!\u201d\u2026\u2026It wasn\u2019t very helpful advice.However, Umbra\u2019s words weren\u2019t that wrong, because feeling the Spirit wasn\u2019t a problem that could be solved with power, knowledge, or technique.The \u2018Ethereal Connection\u2019 that responded to Spirits was different for each person. Whether or not you could feel a Spirit with a small Ethereal Connection was also case-by-case, dependent on the individual\u2019s constitution.And Simon, who was never left out when it came to talent\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026Why can\u2019t I feel it?\u2019was poor at Necromancy.Simon diligently spun an occult tool called \u2018The Ouija Board\u2019 with the students seated around the circular table.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to recite the spell, right?\u201dSaid Jamie Victoria in a hoarse voice.Even her, the honorary class president of Class A who excelled in all subjects, still couldn\u2019t feel the Spirit.The basis of Necromancy was \u2018Spirit\u2019. Any class would be meaningless unless you could feel it.So Umbra split the class into two teams.The first team was a training team that learned the operation of Spirit while following Umbra\u2019s lessons.The second was the preparation team. As they couldn\u2019t feel the Spirit yet, they repeated only the actions to feel the Spirit with various tools throughout the class.Rotating the Ouija Board for the entire period of the class, performing bizarre dances to summon Spirits while holding occult tools, going inside a coffin-like a corpse, meditating (obviously, you\u2019d get scolded if you fell asleep or dozed off), and repeating these odd activities.\u201cYou have no guts!\u201dOccasionally, Umbra gave practical exercises to the training team and came to see the status of the preparation team.\u201cExert more spirit!\u201dWhile five students were spinning the Ouija Board, putting their hands on the handle together, Umbra grabbed the handle with his large hand.\u201cGrab the handle harder! Like this! Like this! Spin it with all your might and utmost sincerity!\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201dHe was so powerful that he overwhelmed five teenage students just by himself.\u201cYour voices are low!\u201d\u201cYes sir!!\u201dJamie Victoria closed her eyes and began to recite the Spirit-summoning spell in a loud voice.After nodding with satisfaction, Umbra\u2019s gaze turned away.\u201cWhat? You! What are you doing right now?!\u201dUmbra\u2019s gaze turned to Camibarez, who was sweating profusely while doing the ritual dance this time.Startled, she said,\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, professor!\u201d\u201cRaise your legs more! Higher, higher! That\u2019s right! The ritual to call a Spirit isn\u2019t child\u2019s play! Make your movements bigger!\u201d\u201cYeeess sir!\u201dSmall tears welled up in her eyes as she swung her knees and performed the bizarre dance. Her whole body was drenched in sweat.To be honest, it wasn\u2019t really a dance suitable for a girl.Shaking your head wildly, moving your shoulders back and forth, crossing your arms in a cobra shape and swinging them up and down. It was hard to understand how the hell it was a Spirit-summoning dance.The students had already given it nicknames, like Chicken Feed dance, or Squid Courtship dance.\u2018P-Poor Cami\u2026\u2026\u2019While Simon was looking at her with a pitiful expression\u2026\u201cAlright! Assistants! It\u2019s time to swap!\u201d\u201cYes professor!\u201dThe assistant teachers approached Simon and the group who were spinning the Ouija Board and said,\u201cPlease leave everything on your seat and stand up. We\u2019ll move to perform the ritual dance.\u201dThe time had come.Simon sighed inwardly and stood where Camibarez had been dancing before, the place covered with sheets at the back of the lecture room.This also had things like position, so students had to stand facing each other, a small distance apart, and in front of Simon stood Jamie Victoria, a female student of all people.\u201cI believe you\u2019ve memorized the dance by now. We\u2019ll start.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The assistants started playing strange instruments with skulls.Tootle-too~A strange sound of a flute was heard.\u2018Let\u2019s just empty the mind.\u2019Frankly speaking, it wasn\u2019t a dance you could do with a sane mind. Simon emptied his mind and danced, moving his body as he learned.His legs went forward and then rose up until his knees almost touched his chest. His arms and legs waggled like a wave, then his upper body stretched out, and his whole body wiggled like a mollusk.The students who slightly opened their eyes to check on Umbra\u2019s countenance let out a simper as they saw Simon\u2019s passionate dance.\u2018What is he\u2026\u2026? Why is he working hard on these things too?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s good at everything you do with your body.\u2019Simon began to dance as his body and mind thoughtlessly became one.In fact, he was at the level of oneness between the ego and the outside world.Seeing him, Umbra also laughed with satisfaction.\u201cVery good! Excellent! Even if you can\u2019t feel the Spirit, you just need to have that kind of dedication and effort!\u201dUmbra thought that he should take Simon to the 50th anniversary of Goliath\u2019s death scheduled for this weekend and assign him a part-time job for the Dance of the Spirit. He was really good at dancing.\u2018\u2026\u2026He\u2019s complimenting me, but I\u2019m not happy at all.\u2019Simon opened his eyes slightly while dancing diligently.Class president Jamie Victoria was doing a Chicken Feed dance with sullen gestures. Her face flushed red with embarrassment when their eyes met.\u201cP-Please don\u2019t look this way\u2026\u2026\u201dAt her plea, Simon quickly turned his head.It wasn\u2019t like the students didn\u2019t have anything to complain about having them do this. They just couldn\u2019t dare protest against Umbra, timidly complaining to the assistants.And every time they complained, the assistant teachers said the same thing.\u2018If you don\u2019t like it, go to the training team.\u2019It was a roundabout statement saying that the students of the preparation team were there because their skills weren\u2019t enough, so they couldn\u2019t fight back.Besides, the most surprising thing was the fact that there were one or two students in a class who actually felt the Spirit and raised their hands while dancing the Chicken Feed dance and spinning the Ouija Board.\u201cCongratulations. You may proceed to the training team.\u201dFinally escaping from this embarrassing hell and moving to the training team, the students yelled out a cheer with faces like they were on top of the world.At this point, rumors circulated that the students felt the Spirit from clenching their teeth out of not wanting to die of shame rather than the effect of the occult ritual actually being good.And just like that, the dreadful Necromancy class was over.\u2018Ughhhh\u2026\u2026\u2019After finishing the course of the preparation team, Simon was walking down the hallway, limbs waving like a mollusk.\u201cHey, are you really alright?\u201dAsked Meilyn in surprise. Simon raised his limp arm and gave a thumbs up.\u201cWhat did the training team learn?\u201d\u201cOffensive magic, of course.\u201dAnswered Rick, who was walking on the left with his hands resting behind his head. It was hard to believe, but Rick also managed to get a feel of the Spirit in the first class.\u201cBecause of the Duel Evaluation, all the professors are teaching offensive spells that can be used immediately instead of theories. I believe it\u2019s the same for other classes.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 What\u2019s our next class again?\u201dRick replied with a smirk,\u201cIt\u2019s Hemomancy.\u201dThe class had been postponed until now due to the overlap of Silage\u2019s mission schedule and personal circumstances.It was the first class for Class A today.* * *The Hemomancy class was held in the \u2018Magical Bullet Shooting Range\u2019 building.The professor was the famous Silage Basabar. that middle-aged professor who guided Simon on the Nether Whale and brought him to Kizen.Like a patient fighting disease, a face pale, cheeks sunken, and hands yellow, he now had more white hair than black.Simon thought that his condition had become worse than when he first saw him.\u201cCough, cough. Hemomancy is a dark magic that uses blood as a medium.\u201dSeven students, including Simon, stood in the firing range. A target was attached 200m in front of them.\u201cIt\u2019s known by the public as a study to the extent of reproducing the secret arts of Vampires and Blood Wolves, but that\u2019s not true. As the most compatible substance for jet-black is the caster\u2019s blood, it has a long history.\u201dThe students in the firing range were preparing to shoot, and the rest of the students were listening to Silage\u2019s explanation from their seats.\u201cThe jet-black and its operator\u2019s blood are compatible in one way or another. Necromancers can \u2018artificially\u2019 mix jet-black and blood to create various magical reactions.\u201dSilage spread his hands. Drops of jet-black flowed from one hand, and blood flowed from the other.When drops of blood and jet-black met in the air, they provoked a fierce reaction and bounced around with great speed.Exclamations broke loose among the students.\u201cCough cough! Outside of being a Hemomancy professor, I can confidently say that it\u2019s a waste of power for a necromancer to not use blood. Although the caster\u2019s stamina is consumed, Hemomancy can be a necromancer\u2019s fastest and most powerful weapon.\u201dUnder the control of the assistant teachers, the students standing in the firing range held their right hand closed, pointed with their index fingers, and aimed at the target.All of them had an IV-like device on their arm, and when the assistants operated the device and spread the magic circle in front of the student\u2019s finger, the magic circle was dyed red with blood.This was the basic skill of Hemomancy, \u2018Blood Bullet\u2019. To put it simply, the IV device was sort of a Hemomancy version of the magic circle rectifying tool.\u201cKehem. We\u2019ve been delayed a lot since today is the first class for Class A. In today\u2019s class, we\u2019ll find out what kind of blood you have, how this blood can be a help, and finally, we\u2019ll try to use the Blood Bullets in action.\u201dEven if we were delayed, how many things were we doing simultaneously?Simon looked at the target 200m away with those thoughts in mind. Not only was one target there, but up to 10 were standing further behind it.Silage turned around while folding his arms behind his back.\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll move on to the actual training.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll move on to the actual training. 1st shooter, ready.\u201d\u201cYes! 1st shooter, Carrel Oxara, ready, sir!\u201dCarrel answered as the assistant teacher had told her in advance. Silage continued.\u201cCommence shooting.\u201dThe moment she activated her magic circle, a bullet of both jet-black and blood shot out from her fingertips.The bullet hit right in the center of the target with a poof.\u201cThe blood type is AP-5. The penetration is 45 mm in diameter. Three targets were penetrated!\u201dAn assistant teacher reported right away.When Silage nodded and activated the mana projector, the students sitting outside the firing line also saw the target Carrel Oxara had hit.\u201cThe AP-5 blood type has the property of contracting when it comes into contact with jet-black.\u201dSilage spread out his palms to shift his jet-black into a balloon-like clump, and then poured a drop of AP-5 blood on it. Then, the jet-black quickly gathered around the blood.\u201cIt has good penetration, capable of compressing jet-black to the extreme, but it\u2019s more specialized for building than for emission. It can help form a magic circle, so it\u2019s a specialized type for the support of jet-black.\u201dSilage turned his head again and looked at Carrel.\u201cYou may go back to your seat. Ask the assistant teacher to give you an AP-5 name tag.\u201d\u201cYes sir! Thank you!\u201d\u201cEveryone else, you must also wear your name tag on the right side of your chest in the next Hemomancy class. Next, 2nd shooter.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dA voice of a very nervous girl was heard.\u201c2nd shooter, Camibarez Ursula! Ready, sir!\u201dA small smile appeared on Silage\u2019s expressionless lips.\u2018Ursula family, huh? So she\u2019s a vampire.\u2019Camibarez aimed at her target, arms trembling.Since it was her first class in her major, she looked very nervous. Moreover, it was a vampire\u2019s turn, a species known as the Emperors of Hemomancy, so everyone was focused on her too.\u2018Do your best, Cami.\u2019Simon, who was sitting 6th in line, was also supporting her silently, and Camibarez\u2019 eyes suddenly turned toward Simon.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019It was like his support actually reached her.With a smirk, she turned her head back and stared at her target.\u201cCommence shooting.\u201dWith Silage\u2019s instruction, she activated the magic circle.Blood and jet-black that flowed from the tip of her finger held together and shot out like a bullet.Pooooooooof!Then, something incredible happened. The moment her Blood Bullet hit the target, it exploded without penetrating them. Four nearby targets were swallowed up in the explosion and destroyed.Woah-!The students waiting in the firing line burst out in exclamation. Students who were sitting at the desks were also sticking their heads out.\u201cThe blood type is KP-1. Estimating the diameter of the penetrating mark would be meaningless, and there are four targets destroyed by the explosion.\u201dOn the screen of the mana projector, you could see the four targets completely shattered.Silage continued his explanation.\u201cKP-1 blood tends to explode when combined with jet-black. In terms of attack power alone, it\u2019s the strongest among currently known blood types. It\u2019s a type that only vampires have.\u201dSilage added, turning back to Camibarez\u2019 firing range,\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll see you more often from now on, Camibarez.\u201dShe got in Silage\u2019s favor!Camibarez said a loud thank you, moved. Some students murmured in jealousy,\u201c\u2026\u2026As expected from a vampire.\u201d\u201cHer lineage is crazy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ursula. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201dThen, in quick succession, the 3rd and 4th students shot their Blood Bullets. They all had different blood types, and Silage explained the dark magic that was compatible with each type.And after a while\u2026\u201cNow, next student, get ready.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dWhile the 5th shooter was going, the assistant teacher approached Simon standing at the 6th firing range.\u201cExcuse me. It might sting a liiittle.\u201dAs she activated the IV device attached to Simon\u2019s arm, he felt the blood rushing from his body to the tip of his finger.Moments later, she spread a magic circle on the tip of his finger, and Simon\u2019s jet-black and blood flowed out, staining the magic circle red.\u201cNow, good luck~\u201dThe assistant teacher cheered in a small voice.\u201c6th shooter.\u201dThen he heard Silage\u2019s voice. Simon quickly came to his senses and said,\u201cYes, 6th shooter, Simon Polentia, ready, sir!\u201dFinally, his turn came. Simon closed his left eye and stretched out the tip of his index finger, aiming firmly at his target.\u201cCommence shooting.\u201dHis mind went blank as Silage gave his instruction.The moment his concentration reached its peak, Simon activated the magic circle.A Blood Bullet shot out, his hand being pushed back by the recoil.Woosh!However, the bullet that Simon fired suddenly vanished.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Simon and the students who were watching while holding their breath blinked, wondering what was going on, and Hector\u2019s faction burst into laughter.\u201cAhaha! What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cA dark magic where the bullet disappears?\u201dIt was then. The blood bullet that disappeared in the middle appeared before the target while emitting blue light.Craaackle!As the blue light collided with the target, the firepower spread out in a fan shape. Two of Simon\u2019s targets were torn, and one target from the 5th range on the left, and one target from 7th on the right were also destroyed.\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019Silage had also never seen a Blood Bullet that spread out in a fan shape the moment it reached the target.The assistant teacher shook her head in bewilderment and said,\u201cNo matching blood type was found. It\u2019s a new type.\u201dClamors.Silage raised his hand to silence the students and opened his mouth.\u201cHit targets, 2 in front, 2 to the left and right. It\u2019s a type that I\u2019m seeing for the first time, so I can\u2019t really explain it. Next, the 7th shooter. Please get ready.\u201dSilage immediately proceeded with the next shooting.Simon was just puzzled. Could there be a type that a Hemomancy professor had never seen?As Simon came out of the firing range, the assistant teacher who was distributing name tags scratched his head.\u201cI don\u2019t have\u2026\u2026 any name tags for you. I\u2019ll prepare a new one for you in tomorrow\u2019s class.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dSimon returned to the seat where Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez were waiting with puzzled faces.As soon as Simon arrived, the three interrogated Simon.\u201cHey, Simon! What is it now?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know either. I just did what I was told.\u201d\u201cA new type! That\u2019s amazing, Simon!\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dMeanwhile, Rick folded his arms with a worried expression.\u201cNew type sounds cool since it\u2019s kind of special, but I\u2019m worried about your future. Doesn\u2019t this mean you won\u2019t have any guidelines in Hemomancy?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dIn Hemomancy, even with the same spells, you\u2019d have a very different training method for each type of blood.Because of that, Hemomancy had more assistant teachers than any other subject, and students were required to put on their name tags with their types on them.When Silage presented the overall direction, the assistant teachers informed the students with detailed tips suitable for their blood types.\u2018What\u2019s gonna happen to me now?\u2019Simon couldn\u2019t help but worry about how his Hemomancy classes would be from now on.* * *After the Hemomancy class was over, Silage was replaying the video of Simon\u2019s blood bullet taken on the mana projector.\u2018\u2026\u2026I knew it. I\u2019m certain.\u2019The characteristic of Simon\u2019s blood was \u2018Multiply\u2019.There was no special action the moment the jet-black and blood met, but the jet-black ate the blood, increasing in capacity and power.The Blood Bullet flying in seemed to disappear in the middle because the jet-black ate the blood, and the bullet became invisible. Even then, the jet-black hit the target, and damage occurred properly.\u2018Interesting.\u2019An ability that was completely opposite to that of vampires, including Camibarez Ursula.The powerful blood of vampires consumed jet-black and increased in size, but in the case of Simon, jet-black consumed blood.\u2018He\u2019s a really interesting case. This is definitely worth researching.\u2019Silage closed his eyes and leaned back into his chair, getting lost in memories.\u201c\u2026\u2026Now I understand why Bahil worked so hard.\u201dJust a few days ago.Silage and Bahil met in the Professor\u2019s lounge.\u201cProfessor Silage. I have an offer to make.\u201dCertainly, Bahil at that time was more polite than usual.\u201cDo you know this student named Andrea Saki in Class B, which I\u2019m in charge of?\u201d\u2018There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019Instead of answering, Silage took a sip of tea.\u201cShe\u2019s a half-vampire, but a Curses aspirant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that she\u2019s quite a gifted student in Curses, but she scored higher in Hemomancy on the recent test as well. A premium one since she\u2019s a vampire too.\u201dClick.Silage put down the teacup and glared at Bahil.\u201c\u2026\u2026So?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll persuade Andrea to major in Hemomancy. She\u2019s a student who\u2019ll be a great strength to you in the future, Professor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve always been arrogant, even as a student.\u201dSilage\u2019s eyes turned fierce.\u201cKnow your place, even if you got into the Crow.\u201dBahil bowed his head politely.Of course, it was only his actions. His eyes didn\u2019t show any signs of succumbing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I sounded arrogant. I just wanted to help you, as your old student.\u201d\u201cHah! A student who stopped studying Hemomancy as soon as they entered the 2nd semester?\u201d\u201cProfessor Silage, there\u2019s only one thing I want.\u201dBahil\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cPlease give up on the recruitment of Simon Polentia from Class A. That\u2019s my only request.\u201dWhen he first heard it, he thought it was odd because it was an unprofitable trade for Bahil.For Silage, this person named Bahil was a person who moved only for his own benefit.Silage obviously thought it was a deal to persuade one of his students to major in Curses in exchange for receiving Andrea from Bahil\u2019s side.But that wasn\u2019t it.Bahil\u2019s condition was to give up on recruiting a student who had already decided to major in Summoning.Just by declaring that he\u2019s giving up on recruiting Simon, Silage could\u2019ve acquired an outstanding individual at the level of a direct disciple.He couldn\u2019t understand it at the time, so he avoided giving a direct answer, being dubious of Bahil.However\u2026\u2018Bahil, you bastard\u2026\u2026\u2019The corners of Silage\u2019s lips rose.\u2018So you were trying to take this genius for free, huh?\u2019At that moment, the lecture room door opened, and a male assistant teacher approached. Silage woke up from recollection and looked at him.\u201cProfessor, I brought your coffee.\u201d\u201cThank you. And you, go to my lab right now and prepare for research paper registration.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Pardon?\u201dThe assistant teacher blinked. In the midst of this busy schedule with the class being delayed, a research paper all of a sudden?\u201cTh-Then, what would the topic be\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cA new type of blood.\u201dSaid Silage while taking a sip of coffee. The assistant quickly figured it out.\u201cSo you\u2019re going to research the blood of Simon Polentia.\u201d\u201cYeah. We need to hurry before the other Hemomancers in Kizen start to move. Let\u2019s call the new blood, well\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, he chuckled and said,\u201cSM-1 for now, I suppose.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cAnd relay this on to all the other assistant teachers.\u201dSilage\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cFrom now on, we\u2019ll also participate in fighting over Simon Polentia.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58It was the same in Beginner Dark Magic, Necromancy, and even their first Hemomancy class.The Kizen professors came up with a class curriculum that seemed to be thinking a lot about the Duel Evaluation.Of course, Curses, the last class of the day, was no exception.\u201cWhen I enter the class, the first thing I observe is the eyes of the students.\u201dSaid Bahil, dressed in a sophisticated pure white suit as always, while setting his felt fedora down onto the table.\u201cOh my. They\u2019re full of anguish today. It looks like you won\u2019t be able to concentrate in class. Shall I take a look at what you guys are thinking? Ahh, it\u2019s the Duel Evaluation. The Duel Evaluation is the only thing on your mind right now!\u201dSmall laughter came out with Bahil\u2019s humor.\u201cI also graduated from Kizen, so I know it well. The fact that you have to fight against other Kizen students must be unnerving. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll show you the way.\u201dBahil made his unique, trustworthy smile.\u201cWith just this class, I\u2019ll teach you how to quickly and safely subdue your opponent. You just have to trust and follow me.\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes sparkled. Needless to say, the name Bahil had some sort of great halo that seventeen-year-old boys and girls couldn\u2019t even look up to.\u201cI think the type of dark magic you\u2019ll use should\u2019ve been established to some extent by now. Let\u2019s divide today\u2019s class into two parts.\u201dBahil looked around.\u201cStudents who have clearly chosen the dark magic they\u2019ll use in the upcoming Duel Evaluation will need a curse specialized for support. I\u2019ll teach you the speedy \u2018Heavy Foot\u2019 that can pressure the opponent quickly without burdening you.\u201dA clamor broke loose among the students. It was a spell that wasn\u2019t written in textbooks.\u201cHumans are creatures with a precarious sense of balance, standing up on their hind legs and walking with their backs straight. Just falling over makes most of their actions impossible. Heavy Foot restricts movement by exhausting only certain areas, including the opponent\u2019s feet. If the opponent receives it strongly or moves too hard, they\u2019ll fall over. Of course, the advantage is that it\u2019s a lot faster and lighter than Exhaust.\u201dBahil chuckled.\u201cAnd to the students who\u2019re looking through textbooks right now, it\u2019s only natural that you can\u2019t find it there no matter how hard you try. I refined it myself.\u201dWoahh\u2026\u201cThe following one is for the students who\u2019re Curse aspirants or who\u2019ll mainly use curses in Duel Evaluation, as well as students who have not yet decided which dark magic to use. I\u2019m going to teach these students a remake of the Paralyze curse.\u201dA remake of Paralyze! Yet again, it was a spell that wasn\u2019t found in textbooks.\u201cIt\u2019s less effective than Paralyze, but it can be completed faster through refinements made for actual fights. I also arranged it so that it\u2019d be effective with a combination of basic runes and formulas that first-year students can use right now. By stacking it up during battle, you\u2019ll be able to produce the original spell\u2019s effect.\u201dTwo options were given to the students.Would they choose Heavy Foot, a weak but effective spell, or Remade Paralyze, a strong spell that allowed them to completely subdue their opponent?\u201cNow then. Let\u2019s split up.\u201dBahil clapped his hands.\u201cStudents who come to the left will learn Heavy Foot, and those who come to the right will learn Remade Paralyze.\u201dThe students began to buzz around and split between the left and the right.At this time, Bahil\u2019s gaze was focused on only one person.\u2018\u2026\u2026Now, Simon Polentia.\u2019Madness was flashing in his eyes.\u2018A genius like you must wear clothes that fit you perfectly. Curses are the best way to utilize your jet-black by 200%! Get rid of that old, outdated Summoning. Not even a fool would use Summoning as their main weapon in the Duel Evaluation! Don\u2019t you understand?\u2019Bahil was biting his lip with an unusually tense expression on his face.Simon, who was talking with Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez, shortly changed his course.\u2018Which way are you going! Of course, you\u2019d go right\u2026\u2026!\u2019Simon came in with Meilyn on the left, and Rick and Camibarez were on the right.Seeing Simon\u2019s choice, Bahil strongly bit his lip.He again chose Curses as the \u2018Sub\u2019 rather than the \u2018Main.\u2019\u201cProfessor Bahil.\u201dAt that moment, when Bahil was becoming furious, he felt someone\u2019s hand holding his shoulder.As he turned around with his eyes full of madness, the gray-eyed assistant teacher brought her finger to her lips.\u201cThat face\u2026 You\u2019re making that face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBahil\u2019s expression softened as if the anger was a lie, and his usual soft smile covered his face.\u201cOh my. I guess I got a little agitated. Thank you, Chehekle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. This is my job. Other than that, your command, please.\u201dBahil straightened his tie.You could see the assistant teachers rummaging through the formula designs of Heavy Foot to prepare to teach.\u201cSend all the assistants to the right. I\u2019ll teach them Heavy Foot myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? But last week you said you\u2019ll be teaching Remade Paralyze\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI changed my mind.\u201dThis was a difficult situation.The assistant teachers had been expecting to teach the Heavy Foot, preparing the materials all night.Chehekle thought about persuading him, but he looked very firm.\u2018He would die before he changes his mind, huh?\u2019The assistant teachers would only obey the Professor\u2019s orders. She bowed her head.\u201cAlright, Professor.\u201dChehekle approached the assistant teachers preparing for class. They were setting up a mana projector and giving handouts to the students.\u201cHold on. Gather up, assistant teachers.\u201dThe assistant teachers gathered in wonder at the sudden assembly order.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? We need to start right now since it\u2019s a two-hour class.\u201d\u201cThe Professor has changed his mind. He\u2019s going to be teaching Heavy Foot.\u201d\u201cWhaaaat?\u201dBahil\u2019s assistants murmured in bewilderment.\u201cHey, that\u2019s absurd, big sis! We prepared for Heavy Foot, but if he changes it like this on the day\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t right! Please persuade him, Senior!\u201dChehekle folded her arms.\u201cYou do know that he\u2019s not the person to listen to us trying to persuade him, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it your first time seeing the Professor being unpredictable? Stop whining and get ready. I\u2019ll try to do something with teaching Paralyze.\u201dThe assistant teachers laid down the materials, shoulders dropping, and moved on.While patting her juniors on the back to encourage them, Chehekle turned her gaze toward a boy sitting in his seat.\u2018The reason why Professor is acting like that\u2026\u2026 Would it be because of him?\u2019While thinking that things would get tough from now on, for both her and Bahil, Chehekle turned her back.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *And just like that, including Curses, all classes were finished for today.Rick went down to Rochest, and Meilyn and Camibarez headed to the women\u2019s dormitory. Simon sat alone on an empty bench, staring blankly at the sky.A beautiful sunset was setting in the sky.[What kind of thoughts are you so immersed in, Boy?]As he was blanking out, Pier talked to him. Simon looked up at the sky and said,\u201cPier, does the Commander have to major in Summoning?Pier chuckled.[Not really! If you want to choose Combat Magic, I can run the Legion myself! It\u2019s purely your choice whether the Legion goes down as a secondary and you focus on your natural power! The Legion will respect that will!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter Simon stayed silent for a moment, Pier grinned.[Why? Did you expect me to stop you?]Simon made a guilty face.\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon let out a huge sigh.\u201cEveryone says it. That Summoning is weak. It\u2019s outdated. Other professors and students, and even Professor Aaron, who teaches Summoning.\u201d[So\u2026 Are you going to stop Summoning??]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQuitting Summoning.Simon felt a strong repulsion welling up in his heart.[Perhaps that feeling is how you really feel.]Pier chuckled.[In my opinion, Boy, you like Summoning! Although you\u2019re the type of person who likes to learn new things and feel a sense of accomplishment, your feelings for Summoning are unique. Do you really need the Legion to find a reason to continue Summoning?]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t deny a word.[However! That mustn\u2019t be what you\u2019re agonizing about!]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Boy! Your thoughts and values are already established! It\u2019s not like you to think about whether to give up Summoning just because of other people\u2019s comments! Something less than that. Something a little more trivial and insignificant than that!]The corners of Pier\u2019s lips went up high.[Don\u2019t you just have the mentality of wanting to win this Duel Evaluation with Summoning alone?]\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon looked down at Pier\u2019s clone with a shocked look. Then, he let out a small sigh and smiled.\u201cWoah, I really can\u2019t fool you, Pier.\u201d[Kuhehe!]\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s stupid? I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be mature. There\u2019s a better way, but I keep wanting to win with Summoning\u2026\u2026\u201d[Why do you think that is?]\u201cJust, it pisses me off. Summoning is weak. It takes time. Support from other majors is required. Summoning alone can\u2019t win. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard all day. From assistant teachers, Rick, professors, and even Toto, a Summoning aspirant.\u201dSimon crossed his arms.\u201cIt\u2019s not my major yet, but it pissed me off a little. That Summoning is treated like that.\u201d[But you\u2019ve always chosen the most effective paths. I see. You agonized over it because those two notions collided.]\u201cYes.\u201dSimon stood up and brushed off his pants.[So, what\u2019s the result of your agonizing?]\u201cAt least for now, I\u2019m going to chase my dream.\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cImagine, Pier.\u201dThe people, everyone, were denying it.If he really won the Duel Evaluation with only Summoning in front of such people\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s gonna feel damn good?\u201d[Kuhahahahahaha! Yeah! That\u2019s it!]Pier laughed out loud.[To be willing to walk a path that others don\u2019t! That act itself is special and valuable! Moreover, there\u2019s no reason for you not to when you have the ability and talent to pull it off!]A blue flame swirled up from Pier\u2019s clone.[Remember, Boy, you\u2019re none other than the Commander of the Legion I chose! Don\u2019t hesitate to cross the line drawn by small fries with the strength of a shark! Do whatever you want!]\u201cYes, Pier.\u201dA light-hearted smile finally formed on Simon\u2019s lips.\u201cNow, I have definitely made up my mind.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59At the same time, in Bahil\u2019s lab.Shatter!Bam!Eyes red, Bahil was throwing anything he could get his hands on.Sculptures, trophies, research materials, everything hit the floor and shattered.\u201cHuff! Huff\u2026\u2026!\u201dIn an instant, the surroundings became a mess.Bahil placed his hand against the wall and panted. The head assistant teacher, Chehekle, seemed to be used to this situation. She had her back against the wall, eyes closed.When the surroundings became quiet after a while, she opened her eyes.\u201cAre you done throwing your tantrum, Professor Bahil?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBahil strode over and leaned back on the sofa as if falling. He then reached out to his table and grabbed the tobacco pipe, lighting it up with dark magic and taking a sip of the smoke.\u201cPhewwww\u2026\u2026\u201dTobacco smoke stretched out. Seeing this, Chehekle frowned.\u201cProfessor, smoking isn\u2019t allowed indoo\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease, let it slide just this once, Chehekle.\u201dHowever, Bahil threw away even the tobacco pipe.As soon as it hit the wall, the pipe broke in two.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why?! Why don\u2019t you understand me, Simon Polentia?!\u201dHe let out a long sigh as he hitchily swept his bangs up. He suddenly jumped up from his seat, unable to get over his anger.\u201cYou\u2019re a genius! A genius among geniuses that only appears once in hundreds of years! Why are you wasting your insane talent on Summoning? I can\u2019t understand it at all! Summoning is an old and outdated subject! Why don\u2019t you know that, no matter how successful you become with Summoning, you\u2019ll become nothing but a 2nd Aaron?!\u201dUnable to bear the frustration, Bahil began to scratch his body as if his whole body was itching.\u201cYour maximum level! Would be Aaron! Think about how Kizen\u2019s Special Admission No.1 with legendary talent is now being treated at Kizen!\u201dHis arms trembled like he was having convulsions, and then he flopped to the floor.Bahil\u2019s eyes glanced at the faded picture frame in the distance.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere, the young-faced him and Aaron, both wearing Kizen school uniforms, put their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders.It seemed like there was no hint of concern on the faces of the two boys. They were just smiling brightly.Perhaps the brightest in their life.But Bahil knew better than anyone. The fact that he\u2019s come too far to go back to that time.\u201cI can\u2019t stand it. Everyone\u2019s so pathetic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Professor.\u201d\u201cTo see such brilliant talents being thrown into the abyss by themselves! I can\u2019t let this happen again! Only I can bring Simon back to life! Only I can cut that gemstone and turn it into the brightest gem in the world!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Just be honest, Professor.\u201d\u201cHonest? That doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\u201dBahil jumped up from the floor.\u201cI want to have him.\u201dA strange smile appeared on his lips. Veins bulged out of his fist.\u201cI insanely want him! Simon Polentia! I definitely want to make him mine!\u201dHere we go again.Chehekle looked like she\u2019d given up.\u201cI\u2019m ready to slash my soul for him. I\u2019ll use any means to unleash the best of his talents and create the 2nd Nefthis!\u201dBahil spread his arms.\u201cMy dedication! My effort! My sincerity! My soul! And the only thing I want in return for risking my life is to bring him up into the realm of the Gods\u2026\u201dHe smiled with a twisted face.\u201cis for him to serve only me as a teacher.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sigh.\u201d\u201cWhen someone asks Simon how he got to the top, Simon will respond like this! \u2018It\u2019s all thanks to my teacher, Professor Bahil.\u2019 Ahhh\u2026\u2026! I\u2019m getting chills just by thinking about it\u2026\u2026!\u201dChehekle, shaking her head as she watched Bahil trembling in madness, turned around.\u201cI\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201cChehekle.\u201dBahil approached her.\u201cI\u2019m a person who needs to get what I want in order to be satisfied.\u201dBahil strongly pulled her by the arm. Then, he lifted her chin as he held her in his bosom.\u201cJust like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes looked at a beautiful work of art.On the other hand, Chehekle, who was looking at Bahil with a pathetic look, kicked him in the leg with her shoes on. Bahil frowned and stepped back.\u201cThis is sexual harassment at work, Professor Bahil.\u201d\u201dThat sour personality from when you were still a student still hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dSaid Bahil, fixing his collar.\u201cTo think that the talent who\u2019ll succeed me is this stiff.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you amend that it\u2019ll be Simon Polentia who\u2019ll succeed you?\u201d\u201cOh, no way.\u201dThe corners of Bahil\u2019s lips rose.\u201cSimon Polentia isn\u2019t just a talent who\u2019ll succeed me, but someone who\u2019ll one day surpass me! He\u2019ll stand shoulder to Nefthis! As an educator, I\u2019m only expressing my reasonable desires! No, more like it\u2019d be abnormal if an educator sees such talent and their blood doesn\u2019t boil. And you\u2019re going to keep saying that my desire to possess him is dirty?\u201d\u201cHow could you describe trying to monopolize the right to teach a student other than dirty?\u201d\u201cMy my. You\u2019re not trying to give a single word.\u201dBahil put his hand in his pocket and tilted his head.\u201cI got a good idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What is it this time?\u201d\u201cRight now, Simon is quite content with his Summoning. Even in Professor Jane\u2019s Cyclops battle, he was on a roll with Summoning. That was the problem in the first place!\u201dBahil\u2019s eyes glistened with madness once again.\u201cWhat Simon has to go through now is a bitter defeat. That way he can look back on himself and think about what the problem is, where he went wrong, and which way to choose!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I guess you have a point. So, how are you going to make such a genius suffer a\u00a0 bitter defeat?\u201dBahil\u2019s mouth was ripped into a demonic grin.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too easy?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Classes went tightly day by day. Of course, it was because of the Duel Evaluation.Even \u2018Eric Aura\u2019, a professor for Mechanics of Jet-Black and a person who was quite thorough with theory, teaching even the origins of runes, moved right away to combat practice.Whether it was to reflect the needs of the students or not wanting to drop their future major aspirants, most of the professors taught mainly combat dark magic this week.Thanks to this, the students\u2019 Duel Evaluation repertoire had greatly diversified. Of course, that was true for all Kizen students.After taking the class this morning and finishing their early lunch, Simon was on his way to the next class with Rick.\u2018So the second and third class are both Hemomancy.\u2019The Hemomancy class, having been delayed due to the professor\u2019s circumstances, was assigned all week.Because of the fact that professors were active Necromancers, there were many cases where the schedule became extreme.And at the same time\u2026\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single day of Summoning this week.\u201dSimon let out a deep sigh. Rick shrugged his shoulders and replied,\u201cI heard that Professor Aaron went on a business trip.\u201dIt bummed Simon out. As it was a Duel Evaluation season, Aaron would\u2019ve taught him offensive magic, and it must\u2019ve been a great reference for Simon.Even if he didn\u2019t, there must\u2019ve been an opportunity to ask how you could use Summoning to fight on an equal footing with other students.\u201cHuh?\u201dRick, who was biting a sandwich as a dessert, stopped walking.\u201cSimon! Look over there!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe brackets for Duel Evaluation are out!\u201dA large bulletin board could be seen in the direction Rick was pointing, and students were already swarming it.The two quickly ran toward it.\u2018My first opponent after coming to Kizen.\u2019Simon looked for his name with a pounding heart.\u2018I think I\u2019ll be fine as long as I dodge the few monsters.\u2019Lorain Archbold, daughter of Nefthis.Serene Aindark, the successor of the Ivory Tower.Chatelle Maerre, the Half-Giant.It was a trio that must be avoided. Other than these people, Simon thought it was somehow manageable.\u2018Ah, found it.\u2019[Stadium 2, Round 1, Match 12]Class A Simon Polentia vs. Class G Haren Cork\u2018Who\u2019s Haren Cork?\u2019It was his first time hearing the name. Rick was giggling like it was the same for him.\u201cLegang Chopra? What a unique name. I wonder if they\u2019re from Shahed.\u201d\u201cRick, you don\u2019t know yours either?\u201dRick nodded and looked at Simon\u2019s opponent.\u201cHaren Cork from Class G\u2026\u2026 Want me to investigate a little? Like their specialty or majoring subject?\u201dSimon scratched the side of his head.\u201cI\u2019ll feel bad for you.\u201d\u201cNah, Legang is also in Class G, so I\u2019ll just include them while investigating. It\u2019d be nice if you also had information about your opponent, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019d be grateful if you would do that.\u201dSimon moved his gaze back to the bulletin board again.Haren Cork. What kind of dark magic would they use to fight? Even if it was a Duel Evaluation, it didn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re just gonna throw punches.A stage where you could exchange dark magics with other students and clearly compare their achievements with each other.It\u2019d be a lie if he said he didn\u2019t feel any pressure, but at the same time, his heart was pounding.\u201cI hope the class ends quickly.\u201dHearing Simon talking to himself, Rick blinked.\u201cHuh? Why all of a sudden? You like taking classes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI have something to train personally in the evening.\u201dRick chuckled.\u201cThis bastard is about to do some stomping again. What training? Let\u2019s be honest. How many students do you think can respond to your Combat Magic and man-killing kick?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026don\u2019t call it a man-killing kick. Plus, I\u2019m not using Combat Magic as my main this time.\u201d\u201cWhat then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna try fighting with Summoning.\u201dRick\u2019s eyes widened out of surprise, but he soon grinned.\u201cWould you like me to do the Meilyn version, or the Cami version?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cJust choose one.\u201d\u201cMeilyn?\u201dRick folded his arms and turned his head away with a coy expression, and he said in a forced female voice,\u201cI clearly told you, alright? To fight with Combat Magic.\u201d\u201cPfffft!\u201dSimon laughed, spit flying out of his mouth.Rick, who was smiling proudly at his friend\u2019s satisfying reaction, suddenly fell down from a bag that flew at him.\u201cJust die!\u201dMeilyn was fuming, red-faced. Next to her was Camibarez, covering her mouth and desperately holding back her laughter.\u201cAh, what\u2019s wrong?! It\u2019s the same if you heard\u2014 Uwaaah!\u201d\u201cDieeeeeee!\u201d* * *As soon as today\u2019s class was over, Simon passed Kevin\u2019s stable route to Rochest.\u2018It\u2019s been a while since I came to Rochest at midnight.\u2019It felt a little strange to see the dark and quiet streets when they were so lively on the weekends.There was nothing good about being found out as a Kizen student, so he was wearing a robe, but there were many boys and girls who wore robes like Simon.\u2018First, the Necromancer shop.\u2019Simon headed to the Necromancer shop he had been to recently.\u201cWelcome~\u201dThe last time he came, Rowen was working part-time, but this time, a young man with a monocle was sitting at the counter.\u2018So he\u2019s the shop owner.\u2019Simon heard a little about him from Rick.A Necromancer who reached the 2nd year in Kizen but had been pushed out by the competition and was currently running a shop in Rochest.Simon bowed his head politely.\u201cHello, Senior!\u201dThe shop owner smiled in embarrassment.\u201cHaha\u2026 A senior? Huh. You don\u2019t have to be like that to me, dear Kizen student.\u201dSimon raised his head.\u201cStill, I heard that you made it to the 2nd year\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nothing but a dropout. The current first-year Kizen students are much more valuable than an old student who dropped out.\u201dStill, he was smiling as though he was inwardly pleased. In fact, many of the people who set their feet and ran businesses in Rochest were from Kizen like him.Whether they couldn\u2019t forget their brilliant student days at Kizen or because they were nostalgic, they were people who still lived around Kizen despite no longer being able to enter it.Because of the existence of such people, the Kizen students, most of whom were high-ranking nobles, weren\u2019t able to make a fuss in Rochest.\u201cAnyway, what are you looking for, Student?\u201dSimon answered the shop owner\u2019s question right away, eyes shining.\u201cI want to make a skeleton archer.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60\u201cOh.\u201dThe shop owner folded his arms and smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t you a freshman? A skeleton archer already?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m planning on giving it a try.\u201dThere were different positions for skeletons.Skeleton archer, skeleton mage, skeleton rider, etc.The \u2018skeleton archer\u2019 was simply a skeleton that used a bow as its main weapon.At first, Simon gave the Island Ratman skeleton a bow and made it try archery, but it was a total mess. It couldn\u2019t even hang an arrow properly, let alone pull the string.So when he looked through textbooks to find a solution, he found that there was a different kind of skeleton suitable for skeleton archers.\u201cSapiros should be safe for a beginner to try out a skeleton archer. This way, please.\u201dSimon and the shop owner headed a little deeper in from the wide, central hall.Simon\u2019s eyes moved wildly. There was a pile of things that he couldn\u2019t understand how to use. He thought that it\u2019d be quite interesting to come here and take a look if he got some time.\u201cThe sapiros bones are over here.\u201dThe shop owner got down on one knee and pulled out a box in a compartment under the shelf.As he blew off the dust, you could see silver letters on a black background. It had a very luxurious look.\u201cShall I show you the inside too?\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201dSimon answered with a voice that was almost a scream. The shop owner opened the box with a smile, looking at his cute junior.\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe inside of the box was covered with an antique red cloth, and in the center was the skull of a sapiros with two horns sticking out. In each space around it were vertebrae, arm bones, leg bones, and more, each stored by type.\u201cVanilla makes the highest quality skeletons.\u201dSaid the shop owner, getting the arm bone and flicking it with his finger.\u201cDid you hear that? It means that it\u2019s been properly refrigerated. For the ones that\u2019ll be used as skeleton archers, the joint of the arm is important. Ah! Of course, the magic circle is also drawn on the skull.\u201dThe shop owner carefully lifted the skull and showed its insides. You could see quite a complicated jet-black magic circle.\u201cIt\u2019s a magic circle that professional necromancers have carefully engraved inch by inch. The defect rate is remarkably low, and even if there\u2019s any defect, compensation will be given from the brand who made it. Bring it to the store, and I\u2019ll exchange it for a new one.\u201dHe was saying things so fascinating that Simon should be ecstatic, but on the contrary, the smile on the corner of his mouth was shaking.\u201cI-It must be really expensive then, huh?\u201d\u201c30 gold per box. But as it\u2019s the Vanilla brand that everyone knows, it\u2019s worth your money.\u201d30 gold!Simon sighed inwardly. He knew that Summoning cost a lot of money, but it was no joke after all.Of course, it didn\u2019t really matter to Simon as a Commander, but 30 gold per unit was terribly expensive considering the short period of use for the skeleton.\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything a little bit\u2026\u2026 cheaper?\u201d\u201cOf course there is! I\u2019ll show you.\u201dThe shop owner got up and looked through the boxes. Then, he carefully pulled out a few boxes and placed them in front of Simon.\u201cStarting from the right, it\u2019s 27 gold, 24 gold, and 22 gold.\u201dEven Simon, who didn\u2019t know much about the undead yet, could see that the quality of the bones became poorer right to left.\u201cAnd there\u2019s also a 20 gold one made by an unknown Necromancer.\u201dAs he opened the box that had been roughly tied with string, you could see a huge mess of bones with a musty smell. After rummaging through the bones, he pulled out the skull and revealed its magic circle.\u201cThe magic circle is still working properly, but it\u2019d be hit and miss whether it\u2019s a defective product or not.\u201d\u2018I\u2019ll have to avoid that.\u2019Simon looked at the other boxes.[What are you thinking about, Boy?!]\u2018Th-That startled me.\u2019[Of course you should choose the most expensive Vanilla brand! It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t use your skeleton if it breaks like other Necromancers! Doesn\u2019t it all become the strength of the Legion?!]\u2018That\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026\u2019Simon looked at the boxes while pondering. What Pier\u2019s saying wasn\u2019t wrong either. If you\u2019re buying something, wouldn\u2019t it be better to choose a good quality one?\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll have three Vanilla sets.\u201d\u201cOh my, a big spender! Sure thing.\u201dThe shop owner whistled and pulled out two more boxes with \u2018Vanilla\u2019 written in silver. Simon, who was watching him, suddenly became curious and asked,\u201cBy the way, why is the brand name of the undead products called Vanilla?\u201dThe shop owner took out a bone and sniffed it.\u201cIt\u2019s because the bones smell like Vanilla.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just joking. The last name of the founder of the brand is Vanilla. Now, let\u2019s proceed to the counter.\u201d\u201cAh! Wait a minute, Senior.\u201dSaid Simon while gulping down his saliva.\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to purchase\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon hearing what Simon wanted, the shop owner smiled.\u201cOh, that\u2019s gonna be really expensive\u2026\u2026 Shall I guide you?\u201d[Damn crazy! Hey, calm down! Do you plan to spend all the money you earned from the mission?]Simon nodded his head, smiling, as he sweated profusely from his back.\u201cYes please.\u201d* * *\u201cPlease come again~!\u201dThe shop owner bowed, and Simon left the Necromancer shop with a light-hearted smile. As a bonus, he also received three bows for skeleton archers.[Tsk tsk. Are you that happy?]Pier grunted.[You ended up buying that expensive thing.]\u201cAhaha\u2026\u2026 Sorry for spending recklessly without any consultation, Pier. But\u2026\u201dHis heart was pounding. He\u2019d placed the items he bought today into the subspace, but he wanted to open it up and touch them again.\u201cI thought it was essential for this Duel Evaluation.\u201d[Well, if that\u2019s the Commander\u2019s decision, I have nothing more to say. Since you already bought it, use it without regrets!]\u201cYes!\u201dHe had to go back to Kizen before it was too late. He pressed on the hood and moved on.Perhaps because he stayed too long in the Necromancer shop, it was already late at night, and there were no people on the roadside.When Simon was moving at a fast pace\u2026\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026!\u2019Simon\u2019s face suddenly turned white when he saw the person walking from the other side. He immediately turned around and entered the alley between the buildings.[Hm? What?! What\u2019s going on?!]\u201cIt\u2019s someone I know.\u201dSimon stealthily peeked out.Although he was wearing a robe, the face and white suit that could be seen through it was a figure that any Kizen student could recognize.\u201cProfessor Bahil? Why are you in Rochest\u2026\u2026?\u201d[Is there a problem? Maybe he wanted to have a drink after work.]\u201cMm.\u201dThat was true. The private life of the professor after work wasn\u2019t something Simon should be concerned about.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHaaah\u2026 I\u2019m finally here.\u201dFortunately, he arrived at the dormitory without any incident. In the middle, he was in a dangerous situation where he could\u2019ve been caught by the Keeper scouting around Kizen, but he passed through without any problems.When he opened the door to room 409, his home sweet home, he was greeted with the usual view.Rick rolling in his bed while reading a magazine, and Kajann snoring with his blanket up to the top of his head.\u201cOh, Simon, you\u2019re back!\u201dRick stood up and said,\u201cWere you okay? Today was the day the Keepers roam around.\u201dSimon shrugged.\u201cI almost ran into one, but I escaped safely.\u201d\u201cHaha! You got a lot of nerve, really. Even if you have an earnest image in class, you always deviate and escape to Rochest. Aren\u2019t you going out more often than me these days?\u201dSimon laughed it off, removed his uniform, and hung it in the closet. He changed into a light, short-sleeved outfit and prepared to leave the room.\u201cAnd where are you going now?\u201d\u201cTo make some skeletons.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden at night\u2026\u2026? What are you planning to make anyway?\u201d\u201cSkeleton archers.\u201dWith those words, Rick jumped out of bed like a spring.\u201cWoah! Woah! Are you already trying to use the skeleton archer? In this Duel Evaluation?!\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019ll work or not.\u201d\u201cIt should be difficult for us to assemble now! What brand is it?\u201d\u201cVanilla.\u201dRick\u2019s eyes lit up while he grabbed Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAh, what are you doing? Hurry up and lead the way!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dThe two left room 409 and headed to the lounge. They headed there because the dormitory self-study room was crowded with people, and they had to be quiet.\u201cThis place would be perfect.\u201dThere was no one else in the huge apart apart from two students talking to each other. Simon and Rick sat down.\u201cHurry up! Bring them out.\u201dSimon opened the subspace and took out the box. The word Vanilla was written in shiny silver letters on a black box.\u201cKyah! Can I open it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dWhen Rick opened the box, white bones appeared on the luxurious red cloth.\u201cLook at this charming color.\u201dThe students who were chatting in the seat next to them seemed to be curious as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cA Sapiros Skeleton Archer Set. It\u2019s apparently from that Vanilla brand.\u201d\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cThis is Vanilla?\u201dEveryone was looking at the box with eyes as if they were looking at the newest product.Simon looked at those students and chuckled. He liked the fact that they had common interests because it was a school of Necromancers.\u201cBut where\u2019s the assembly drawing?\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201dSimon found a piece of paper enclosed below after rummaging through the box. He opened it, and everything was ready.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll begin now.\u201d\u201cGo, go!\u201dSimon first inserted jet-black into the Summoning magic circle drawn on the skull.The colorless magic circle was dyed black, and the runes interlocked and rotated to build an ecosystem called the magic circle.\u201cIs it done?\u201dThe magic circle was working, but there was no movement in the skull. Looking at the magic circle, some runes didn\u2019t activate properly yet.\u201cLook at this, Simon!\u201dRick, who was examining the assembly drawing, said,\u201cSee the four corners of the magic circle here? Apparently, you have to Circling the jet-black and put it in!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s Circling?\u201d\u201cIt must be the technique used to create magic circles in Mechanics of Jet-Black. We haven\u2019t even learned this yet.\u201dAfter all, from the beginning, it was a difficult skeleton for a freshman to make. Simon took out the Mechanics of Jet-Black textbook from the subspace.\u201cCircling\u2026\u2026 Circling\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile halfway through the table of contents, he found the entry for Circling. Simon opened that page.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t this\u2026\u2026?\u201dHe wondered why it seemed familiar, but the content was similar to when he listened to Bahil about core operation in the past.The cycle of jet-black.Meditation.Blackhole.It was almost like the core operation Simon was using now. He thought that the tip Bahil gave was probably based on this thing called Circling.\u2018I might be able to do this.\u2019Simon slowly raised his right arm and closed his eyes.\u2018Cycle, not transformation. A circulating image.\u2019Swaaaaaaa\u2026Jet black began to rise from Simon\u2019s palm.\u201cJet-black has a tendency to remember.\u201dBahil\u2019s voice from his memory echoed in his ears.\u201cJust like the hands and feet of humans. If you repeat the same movements hundreds of thousands of times, the jet-black tries to reproduce the acquired flow without realizing it. Isn\u2019t it amazing? That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to practice repeatedly and develop the right habits.\u201dSimon clenched his teeth. Just focus and contemplate. Make the jet-black remember this flow and keep it this way.Swaaaaaaa\u2026The jet-black had entered a stable state. Sweat dripped down from Simon\u2019s body.\u2018It worked.\u2019Now, even if he paid attention to a slightly different place and looked back, the jet-black was spinning on its own.This was Circling.Simon compressed the whirlpool-like jet-black into a small area and then inserted it directly into one of the four corners of the magic circle.Whirrrrrrr!A light came on in the corner. Like a mechanical device that was supplied with power, the runes that had stopped around them came to life and began to move.\u201cHey, what the hell are you\u2026\u2026?\u201dRick was left speechless.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re following it after going through a textbook once? Are you for real a genius or what?\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Simon smiled awkwardly.\u201cI was just lucky that it\u2019s similar to a skill I knew.\u201dAfter gaining the momentum, Simon immediately started the second Circling. It was a lot easier than when he first started.As Simon began to roll the jet-black in his palm, it felt like it was asking him something like, \u2018Are we doing the same one from earlier?\u2019Like he was responding to it, Simon kept the jet-black\u2019s rotation strong.He was able to complete the Circling and insert it into the magic circle in less than half the time the first took.Whirrrrrrrrrr!Activating the 2nd corner, a few more runes came to life.\u201cNow there are two more left! Continue, Simon!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSimon raised his concentration and continued Circling. The second was easier than the first, and the third was easier than the second.Whirrrr!Finally, a bright light lit up throughout the magic circle when all four corners were ignited.Rattle. Rattlllle.The skull began to come to life. It made a sound by clanging its jaw together, but probably because of the difference in material, it made a clearer sound than the Island Ratman skeletons.At that moment, the skull jumped by itself.\u201cOuch!\u201dIt bit Simon\u2019s arm. Even though it didn\u2019t have any teeth left, its jaw was strong enough to bring tears to Simon\u2019s eyes.\u201cAh, there\u2019s a caution sign here.\u201dSaid Rick while looking at the assembly drawing.\u201cSapiros has a strong habit of biting anything that it sees. After activating the magic circle, step back and throw a dog chew or cushions.\u201d\u201cOh, tell me a little bit sooner!\u201dSaid Simon while whimpering to remove the skull.\u201cI just discovered it. Apparently, if you connect to its thoughts and tame them slowly after a day or two, these aggressive tendencies will decrease a lot.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time for that.\u201dSimon opened his eyes and glared at the skull.\u201cGet down here.\u201dThe skull that had been chewing on Simon\u2019s arm flinched. When Simon kept staring at it, it finally let go of Simon\u2019s arm and backed away.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bite anyone from now on. That\u2019s an order.\u201dThe skull drooped and became quiet. It was as if its tail\u2014if it had one\u2014had fallen to the ground. Looking at this, Rick smirked.\u201cIt\u2019s as they say. There\u2019s no such thing as a bad skull, only a bad summoner. They\u2019re all so obedient in front of you.\u201dNow that he had activated the Summoning magic, it was time for him to assemble the bones. He took the bones out of the box and stroked the skull.\u201cHang in there. I\u2019ll make your body soon.\u201dAs though it understood what Simon said, the skull jumped up and down the table as if it was excited. Then, it knocked Pier\u2019s clone on the table, dropping it to the ground.[Who the hell was that?!]Pier\u2019s voice echoed through Simon\u2019s head.[The newcomer this time must be an ignorant bastard! Tell him that he\u2019ll be as good as dead when he comes down to Legion!]\u2018\u2026\u2026Haha.\u2019Simon placed Pier\u2019s clone back on the table and started working. He proceeded to assemble the skeleton step by step according to the assembly drawing.\u2018After all, this is the most fun part.\u2019The sensation of the skeleton\u2019s bones sticking together like a magnet from the attraction was pleasant.However, the assembly difficulty was considerably greater than that of the Island Ratman.\u2018Banding? How do you do this?\u2019In some parts, the user had to use a jet-black technique in the assembly stage, and some stages required you to use the chemicals included in the box.Assembling the arms in particular was the hardest part. As skeletons were undeads with weak strength, you had to do various tasks to form the strength to pull the string.He made the threads of jet-black pass through the hole between the arm bones and banded it with jet-black as though wrapping the arm with a bandage.After applying an adhesive agent to the joint area, he waited until it dried, and when it became sufficiently damp, he applied heat to finish.It was his first time doing this, so he was quite at a loss. Rick, who\u2019d been dozing off for two hours, ended up returning to room 409, and the other students who occasionally stopped by the lounge were now gone.Simon alone laid out the Summoning and Mechanics of Jet-Black textbooks and persistently concentrated on assembling it.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon, who was insanely absorbed in assembling without realizing the time, looked out the window.Before he knew it, the sun was rising.\u2018It\u2019s the first time in my life that every minute and every second felt so precious.\u2019Still, he had to see it to the end. Simon connected the last two leg bones he had completed.\u201cIt\u2019s complete\u2026\u2026!\u201dAn imposing skeleton with horns on its skull and a smooth, pure-white body moved its limbs.Rattle! Rattlllle! Then, it ran all over the lounge as if it liked its body.\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go outside!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Rattle!Simon and the Skeleton Archer went out of the dormitory together.The appearance of the Kizen campus spread out under the cloudless deep blue sky at dawn was just like a piece of painting.Breathing in the fresh morning air, Simon shouted,\u201cGrab it!\u201dHe opened the subspace and threw the bow made for the skeleton.He was going to hand over the 1 gold bow that he uses, but it might\u2019ve been too hard for a skeleton, so he decided to start with the easy one.Tap.As soon as the skeleton archer received the bow, its body trembled thinly as if it had foreseen something. It then immediately took a disciplined firing stance.It held the bow with its left hand and moved its right hand behind its back. There was nothing there, but it whipped through the air like a broken machine.\u2018\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t tell me, is it looking for the arrow from the quiver on its back?\u2019Skeletons were a kind of undead that retained the habits from back when they were still alive.That was why the bones of monsters that used bows back then were used as materials for skeleton archers. The sapiros was also a half-human half-beast monster that lived in the forest and used bows as its main weapon.\u201cHere\u2019s the arrow.\u201dSimon took out an arrow from the subspace and held it out. Looking at this, the skeleton archer approached with his back showing. His right hand was still scanning for nothing behind his back.Simon let out a small laugh and put the arrow in its hand.Tap.It loaded the arrow with a lightning-like speed and\u2014Sssr!It finished aiming by pulling the string with a skillful posture. Simon accessed its thoughts and appointed its target.\u2018You\u2019re going to shoot that tree.\u2019Things were getting nerve-wracking. Finally, it was the moment to see the results of his night-long work.Simon gave orders with a pounding heart.\u2018Now!\u2019Shhhhhk!The arrow that flew through the morning wind got stuck on the tree with a tung! Simon clenched his fists and let out a cheer.It was Simon\u2019s first skeleton archer.* * *At the same time, Rochest.An old building located a bit far from the center of the city. Under the stairs here, there was an unidentified underground operating room.A man lying on the operating bed slowly got up in this space scattered with bloody tools. His lower body wore only underwear, and his upper body was covered in jet-black tattoos.\u201cUgh.\u201dDue to the severe headache he felt upon waking up, the man rubbed his forehead and frowned.\u201cYou\u2019re awake, Harek Cork?\u201dHis gaze moved. The door to the operating room opened, and a man with an exhausted face walked in.\u201cAh, Professor Bahil!\u201dBahil leaned his back against the wall and folded his arms.\u201cThe operation was successful. How do you feel?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHaren scanned his body covered in jet-black tattoos. Then, he clenched his right fist.Jet-black was flowing like a spring and dripping down to the floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026The power is overwhelming! It feels like I can do anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dBahil smiled and continued his words.\u201cNow, go back to Kizen and take the class as usual. Never, never show your body to anyone. And refrain from taking a shower until the Duel Evaluation. Washing your hair or face would be fine.\u201dWhile saying so, Bahil threw the school uniform hanging from the hanger at Haren.\u201cThe day after tomorrow, when the Duel Evaluation begins, the tattoo will naturally disappear from your body. It won\u2019t get caught by Kizen\u2019s doping test either. However, your Power, which has been strengthened by the curse, will last for about two months.\u201dHaren looked at Bahil as though he was touched.\u201cProfessor, why in the world are you giving me this kind of help\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cReason doesn\u2019t matter, does it? You just have to do what I asked you to.\u201dHearing that, Haren\u2019s expression changed seriously.\u201cYou mean defeating the Special Admission No.1 in Class A, Simon Polentia, in the Duel Evaluation? I see.\u201d\u201cExactly. Even if he\u2019s a Special Admission No.1, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. You\u2019re now far beyond his level.\u201dHaren clenched and opened his fists before checking his body. Then, he pulled out his own special skill, \u2018Black Hand\u2019, from his back.Swaaaaaah!A black hand was pulled out of his back, and Haren couldn\u2019t help but be astonished.Its size and strength were way different from before. As he spread out the black hand in front of him, it was large enough to cover the whole body. You could hear a savage sonic wave whooshing past as he stretched it out and swung it like a whip.\u201cThank you, Professor Bahil! I\u2019ll never forget what you\u2019ve done for me!\u201dThis insane sense of enhancement! For Haren, Bahil felt like a god for granting him such Power. So, he added one more sentence.\u201cIf it\u2019s that Simon Polentia is bothering you, shall I disguise it as an accident in the Duel Evaluation and kill him?\u201dThat moment. Bahil\u2019s smile hardened coldly.Kigigigigigigigigigi!You could hear something like a cry of a ghost from behind Bahil\u2019s back. Haren\u2019s whole body trembled with pure fear.\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid. You only have to do what I told you to do.\u201dHaren felt himself slowly suffocating. Eventually, he grabbed at his own throat.\u201cIf something goes wrong and he dies,\u201dA creepy glare flashed in Bahil\u2019s eyes.\u201cyou and your family won\u2019t be able to die peacefully. I\u2019ll make all of you suffer forever, even after your deaths.\u201d\u201cKuhugh! Cough! I-I\u2019ll keep that in my mind!\u201dAs Bahil took back his aura, Haren gasped and breathed again.\u2018How dare a bastard like you who can\u2019t even be used as a sub-plan\u2026\u2026\u2019Bahil turned his back and left the operating room. He wore a coat and a hat.\u2018Simon, I\u2019m sorry to use this kind of method, but I can\u2019t help it.\u2019It felt like he was burning himself for success, but what Simon needed right now was a defeat.If you fell into a terrible sense of defeat, you\u2019d look back on yourself and ponder what went wrong. And then, you\u2019d come to realize that the cause is Summoning.The corners of Bahil\u2019s lips, which went up to the tip of his ears, were completely twisted.\u2018Someday, I\u2019ll apologize for this. But in the future, you too will be grateful for the decisions I made. Without a doubt!\u2019\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62After staying up all night, Simon went into the first class of the day, Hemomancy, with hollow eyes.But he wasn\u2019t really feeling great. He had to take notes on what was written on the blackboard, but he felt like he was seeing three blackboards where there stood one.\u2018Did I exhaust myself too much last night?\u2019As Simon was dozing off, Meilyn, next to him, tapped him with her elbow.\u201cHey. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in good shape after staying up all night.\u201dMeilyn let out a small sigh. She then brought the bag hanging on her desk to her lap and pulled out a white pillbox after rummaging through her bag.\u201cHey, open wide.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cA pick-me-up. It\u2019s what I drink after staying up all night. Open your mouth.\u201dAs Simon opened his mouth awkwardly, she grabbed a pill with her fingertips and threw it in Simon\u2019s mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t bite it. Stay still. It\u2019s super pungent and\u2019ll make the whole classroom stink.\u201dThis time, Meilyn took the water bottle out of her bag and handed it over. Simon nodded his head in gratitude, opened the water bottle cap, and brought it close to his mouth.Gulp.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhen Simon turned his head, Meilyn was blushing with a somewhat tense expression on her face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know! Just hurry up and drink before the assistant teachers arrive!\u201dSimon drank with the water bottle slightly off his mouth and swallowed the pill.\u201cThank you, Meilyn.\u201dAfter being handed the water bottle, Meilyn turned her head away in shyness.Then Rick, who was sitting behind them, stuck his head between the two.\u201cWoah! That startled me!\u201d\u201cHehehe. I heard it, heard it. I heard everythiiing~\u201dAs Rick hummed and loaded up his prank, Meilyn reflexively growled.\u201cHey, don\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but just don\u2019t do it!\u201dRick pulled his head and shrugged. Then he looked at Camibarez writing her notes next to him.\u201cCami.\u201d\u201cYes, what is it, Rick?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special, but what kind of situation do you think it is when lines such as \u2018open wide\u2019 and \u2018open your mouth\u2019 are exchanged between a man and woma\u2014\u201dCamibarez\u2019s cheeks turned red, and Meilyn, whose face was even redder than that, struck Rick in the head with a notebook.\u201cHey, you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cAgh! Agh! I mean, why are you hitting me! I was just speaking the tru\u2014!\u201d\u201cSimon!\u201dSaid Camibarez in a trembling voice.\u201cY-Y-Y-You can\u2019t say that! We\u2019re still underage! And\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon made a face saying that he didn\u2019t deserve this.\u2018Why am I getting scolded when I just sat down quietly and got the medicine from her?\u2019\u201cHey there, students~\u201dAt the sudden voice that flew into their ears, Simon and his friends stopped and turned their heads. The assistant teacher was smiling with her hands on her back.\u201cDid you all finish writing before chatting~?\u201dIt was a kind voice that somehow seemed like she was speaking with children.\u201cA-Assistant teacher! I can explai\u2014\u201d\u201cJust get up. All four of you.\u201dIn the end, the four of them were called out to the back of the classroom.\u201cPut both of your arms on your ears~ Yeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019ll get angry if you pull some dirty tricks, okay?\u201dEven the punishment felt somewhat cute. As soon as the assistant teacher had left, Meilyn glared at Rick.\u201cAgh, this is embarrassing! It\u2019s all your fault!\u201d\u201cI said I only stated the facts\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop fighting! We\u2019ll get scolded again!\u201dMeanwhile, Simon was looking at the blackboard by himself.Without realizing it, his vision came back clearly. Not sure whether it was the medicine working or because he was being punished, but his drowsiness went away too.\u201cMeilyn.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe medicine that you gave me, it\u2019s working well.\u201dAt Simon\u2019s praise, she smiled at once and put on airs.\u201cHmph, of course! This is suuuper expens\u2014\u201d\u201cMedicine? What kind of medicine is it?\u201d\u201cYou need to shut the fuck up.\u201dAt that moment, another assistant of Silage hurriedly entered the classroom.\u201cProfessor Silage said he\u2019ll be around 20 minutes late! We\u2019ll have our break earlier.\u201dHe said while looking at his watch.\u201cLet\u2019s rest for 30 minutes, starting now.\u201dAt those words, the quiet classroom suddenly became noisy. Simon and his party, who had been punished, were able to return to their table naturally, as it was break time.\u201cWait a minute, groupmates. See me for a second.\u201dRick beckoned, and the three of them, who were about to return to their seats, turned to look at him. They gathered in a quiet corner of the classroom.\u201cUgh, what is it this time?\u201dMeilyn grumbled.\u201cI was gonna tell you guys at lunchtime, but I\u2019ll tell you now while we have some spare time.\u201dRick pulled out a note from his jacket pocket.\u201cHehe. I got the information on your Duel Evaluation opponents. First of all, Simon, the most urgent.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYeah. You were preparing the skeleton archer in this Duel Evaluation.\u201dSimon nodded his head.\u201cYou better stop that right now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cMy words don\u2019t guarantee it 100%, but it\u2019s a bad match with your opponent.\u201dRick began to read the note in a serious voice.\u201cThe opponent\u2019s name is Haren Cork, the infamous Necromancer family of the Oldwin Kingdom. The dark spell he uses is Black Hand.\u201d\u201cBlack Hand? I\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201dOn the other hand, Meilyn opened her eyes blearily as though she had something on her mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026Must be his family\u2019s unique dark magic.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct! To put it simply, it\u2019s like pulling out something like a hand made of jet-black from your back, and apparently, it has an excellent defense against long-range projectiles. Even a jet-black arrow flying at high speed can be deflected with ease.\u201dSimon bit his lip lightly.Even a jet-black arrow can be deflected with ease, huh?\u201cThere\u2019s a high probability that the skeleton archer\u2019s arrow won\u2019t work, Simon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Mmmm.\u201dAlthough he was determined to go with Summoning, he wasn\u2019t so inflexible to keep pushing with the skeleton archer when he knew that it would be a bad matchup.While Simon was contemplating another way, Rick continued.\u201cThe Black Hand is a powerful tool both for offense and defense, but it also has clear drawbacks. Haren Cork can\u2019t use other dark spells while maintaining the Black Hand.\u201cAh, if that\u2019s the case, you have a clear strategy!\u201dSaid Camibarez while her eyes shone.\u201cCurses!\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019re right.\u201dMeilyn agreed.\u201cIf ranged and melee attacks are tough, you just have to keep a distance and build up curse stacks to weaken him. Isn\u2019t it an easy win? You\u2019ll just have to practice Exhaust for the rest of the time!\u201dSimon leaned his back against the wall and pondered.He was on fire while assembling the skeleton archer, but to encounter a variable like this.Simon thought that nothing in the world went the way one wanted, after all.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Time was limited. Should he just force his way with the skeleton archer, or break his initial promise and practice a curse?If not those two, then\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019Simon\u2019s eyes shone bright.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Day by day, time passed quickly, and only a day was left till the Duel Evaluation.Meilyn, who came into the classroom early, as usual, yawned and sat down in her chair. In the front row, the students who arrived first were gathered up, chatting eagerly, and the topic, of course, was the Duel Evaluation.\u201cUuu\u2026 I\u2019m nervous. How should I deal with Combat Magic aspirants?\u201d\u201cI heard that Professor Bahil\u2019s Heavy Foot works well!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m most afraid of Poisonous Alchemy aspirants. Taking off the barrier gauge little by little\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine as long as it\u2019s not the Curses aspirants, though.\u201dMeilyn scoffed while hearing them talk.It was better to do individual training while thinking about the match-up between your opponent and yourself.Wasn\u2019t being strong and confident with your skills enough?It was then when she was pulling out her textbooks as she clicked her tongue.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hello, Meilyn.\u201d\u201cWaah!\u201dShe turned her head in surprise.Simon, with huge, dark circles around his eyes and a haggard face, was there. He said with a tough smile,\u201cMeilyn, you look nice today. Did you get your hair done?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn frowned.Why was he suddenly doing something he hadn\u2019t done before?\u201cWho told you to say that?\u201d\u201cRick.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dIt was very creepy for Simon to imitate Rick\u2019s way of speaking. Above all, it didn\u2019t suit him.\u201cForget it. Why are you trying to flatter me? Say the reason already.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Can I have some medicine?\u201d\u201cGosh.\u201dMeilyn grumbled, but still took the medicine box from her bag and handed it to him. As Simon took her medicine, he regained his senses a little.\u201cDo you realize that I\u2019m the one who\u2019s feeling more anxious when just looking at you? What\u2019s up with you these days?\u201d\u201cPreparation for Duel Evaluation.\u201dMeilyn frowned.\u201cMm. Yeah. It\u2019s good to prepare and all, but you\u2019ll collapse if you keep doing that. Medicines aren\u2019t some sort of magic to get rid of fatigue. Even I only take it occasionally .\u201d\u201cI just have to endure till tomorrow\u2019s Duel Evaluation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Insane.\u201dClass started after a while. Of course, even after class started, Simon\u2019s condition was getting worse and worse.He spent the whole class muttering to himself, jotting down strange things in his notebook, unable to concentrate.\u201cRick! Why the hell is he like that?\u201dAsked Meilyn, unable to bear it. Rick ruffled his hair with a complicated face as though also worried about Simon.\u201cI don\u2019t know either. He hardly comes back to the room these days, and even when I wake up, he\u2019s not around most of the time.\u201dCamibarez, who was watching with a worried face, pulled Rick\u2019s hem.\u201cHe\u2019s gonna collapse at this rate. Please, do something, Rick!\u201dMeilyn added,\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re his roommate!\u201d\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t try? It\u2019s a problem because my advice falls on his deaf ears.\u201dRick turned his head.Even during break, Simon was still scribbling something in his notebook like a madman. It was a typical example of a person who was completely obsessed with something, blocking everything else out.\u201cI believe he\u2019s gonna be like that till the Duel Evaluation is over. I think he\u2019s preparing a dark spell we haven\u2019t learnt yet.\u201d\u201cA dark spell we haven\u2019t learnt yet?\u201dMeilyn let out a feigned laugh.\u201cFor what? He just has to practice Exhaust a little bit to face this opponent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Learning new dark spells is great and all, but I think health comes first.\u201dA flash went across Meilyn\u2019s eyes as she scratched her head angrily.\u201cI can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019ll give him a piece of my mind.\u201dRick leaned his head back into his hands.\u201cYou\u2019d better not. I\u2019m telling you, it won\u2019t work, no matter what you say.\u201d\u201cJust watch me.\u201dMeilyn made up her mind and approached Simon.\u201cHey, Simon! If you keep doing that\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon slowly turned his head.\u2018Huff!\u2019You could see the eyes of a person who was out of their mind.As a boy of her age glared at her with a heavy atmosphere, she timidly stuttered,\u201cH-How many times have I told you that your body will be\u2014\u201d\u201cThanks for your concern, Meilyn. I\u2019ll really start resting tomorrow.\u201dAnd Simon turned his head back and started taking notes.\u2018Th-This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u2019While Meilyn was thinking about what to say next, Simon suddenly stood up. Meilyn let out a short scream, startled.\u201cRick.\u201dThis time, Rick answered while flinching.\u201cHuh? Yeeaah?\u201d\u201cThe thing that I asked\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, news about Professor Aaron? I think you\u2019ll have to wait till lunchtime.\u201d\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201dSimon sat down back and went back to his notes.The three people\u2019s worried gazes gathered together.What kind of dark spell was he preparing?* * *The same day\u2019s evening.Aaron was coming into Kizen.He wasn\u2019t dressed in his usual shabby clothes. He was dressed in the uniform of the Kizen headquarters, with a black fur cape and a handsome appearance.Some of the servants cleaning the building didn\u2019t even recognize that he was Aaron.\u2018\u2026\u2026This is tiring.\u2019The mission ended earlier than he expected.It was a rest day until today, but he decided to stop by the lab for a while to prepare for class.\u2018It feels suffocating.\u2019Aaron took off his coat and loosened his tie as he walked toward the lab. The more he walked, the lighter his clothes grew, and the bigger the pile of clothes in his right hand became.When he arrived at the lab door while taking off his clothes one by one, someone was sitting on the floor. He was muttering strange words while scanning a notebook with hollow eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon Polentia.\u201dSimon raised his head. When he saw Aaron, he jumped up and bowed his head.\u201cProfessor Aaron!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dSimon was somehow sullen and thin, seeing him after a week. He politely said,\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to ask you, Professor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron wordlessly looked at the watch on his wrist.\u201cEven if it\u2019s past my work hours?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201dAaron smirked.\u201cIt\u2019s the professor\u2019s duty to solve the students\u2019 problems. Come in.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Aaron strode over, opened the door to the lab, and went inside.Simon looked at Aaron\u2019s back, slightly bewildered.\u2018So Professor Aaron also makes jokes, huh?\u201dSimon didn\u2019t know, but it was a sight that would make the assistant teachers faint with surprise if they saw it.And just like that, Simon entered Aaron\u2019s lab for the first time.All kinds of unknown undead materials filled the room wherever he looked.He could feel how much Aaron loved Summoning just by being here in this room.In particular, the dragon bone that wrapped around the entire laboratory was very impressive. It was shaking and moving as if it were alive. It seemed to be in the state of a skeleton rather than a simple decoration.\u201cSit anywhere you like.\u201dSaid Aaron while taking his trousers off. Soon, he threw them, and they hung around the neck of the dragon bone surrounding the lab.The dragon bone shook its neck as though it hated it, but it couldn\u2019t resist any more than that.Simon held back his laughter and found a seat.Everything hanging on the wall and on the floor was valuable for research and studies, so Simon had to be careful with each step. Soon, he found a sofa, set aside the ghoul model leaning on it, and sat down.\u201cSo, what did you want to ask again?\u201dAaron, who took off his top and wore shorts and slippers before Simon even realized it, was making tea.Simon took a light breath and said,\u201cI\u2019d like to know how to win a Duel Evaluation with Summoning alone.\u201dAaron\u2019s movements stopped for a second. But that was just for a second. Soon, he casually poured tea into a cup.\u201cWhy would you do such a pointless thing?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cSimon, I know you\u2019re excelling in Combat Magic and other subjects too.\u201dAaron approached Simon and held a teacup to Simon.\u201cYou have a clear way to get past this evaluation easily. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d go through so much trouble.\u201dSimon held his breath.In fact, he knew Aaron would say something like that. Even in Simon\u2019s first Summoning studies class, Aaron himself made a statement that demeaned Summoning.So it was even stranger.You could feel a lot of things by looking at his lab.Why did a person who loved Summoning this much, a person who was so passionate about his major, say those kinds of things to the students of Kizen?\u201cThen I\u2019d like to ask you, Professor.\u201dSimon strained his eyes.\u201cIs there any other reason needed for a Summoning aspirant wanting to win with Summoning?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron stopped moving and stared at Simon. Simon didn\u2019t look away either.After a brief pause, Aaron took his teacup and drank his tea. Simon also carefully took a sip, feeling thirsty.The first taste was bitter, but the aftertaste lingering inside the mouth was sweet.\u201cDo you want me to divulge the solution? Or\u2026\u201dIt was hard to believe, but when Aaron put down the teacup, a smile was on his lips.\u201cDo you want me to correct the solution you have chosen?\u201dAt the same time, Simon also smiled with his teeth.\u201cThe latter, Professor.\u201d* * *Finally, the day of the Duel Evaluation.Kizen was operating 5 indoor stadiums simultaneously for the Duel Evaluation.Among these, Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez were at the 2nd Stadium.Simon was the only one from group 7 to take the evaluation in the morning. Everyone just stopped by to cheer for Simon.But\u2026\u201cWhere the hell is he?!\u201dMeilyn in the stand stamped her feet repeatedly. Camibarez was also fidgeting and constantly looking around her.Simon\u2019s turn was approaching soon, and he was nowhere to be seen.\u201cYou guys stay here.\u201dEventually, Rick stood from his seat.Another match was finished while Rick went out.The student who won raised both hands in joy, and the student whose barrier gauge dropped to 0 dropped his head.The rules for the Duel Evaluation were similar to the Cyclops performance assessment.The students on each side fought while wearing a Protection Suit with the effect of \u2018full-body shield\u2019, and the one whose barrier gauge fell to 0 lost.So, the student who won today\u2019s duel would start from the middle squad, and the student who lost would start from the lower squad.If you lost in the lower squad next week, you\u2019d be demoted to the lowest squad according to your performance. In other words, \u2018Expulsion from Kizen\u2019 would be possible.Because of this, the burden on all the students was at its peak.The audience was full of students who came to cheer for their friends or to gather some information.Of course, other than the Kizen students, there were also adults who came in from all over the Dark Alliance. Kizen students were the next generation of talents who\u2019d lead the continent in the future, so it was natural for the institutions or organizations to collect information.And the scouts who were now in the 2nd Stadium only had one interest.\u201cNow, we\u2019ll be able to see this year\u2019s Special Admission No.1 soon.\u201d\u201cSimon Polentia, I\u2019ve never heard the name.\u201d\u201cHis whereabouts are unclear too. Apparently, he\u2019s a student that was suddenly selected by Nefthis.\u201d\u201cI heard that he\u2019s a Summoning aspirant.\u201d\u201cSummoning? What are the professors of Kizen doing? Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re seriously planning to throw a Special Admission No.1 to Summoning?\u201dWhile the adults were chatting in the audience seats and making up a list of scouts, the most anxious ones were Meilyn and Camibarez.The two could hardly sit still and were scanning the waiting room.Then, an announcement was aired from the speaker on the ceiling.[Simon Polentia from Class A, Haren Cork from Class G, please head to the stadium.]The opponent, Haren Cork, was coming into the stadium.Camibarez trembled and put her hands together.\u201cPlease, Simon! Where in the world are you?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Haren Cork came to the stadium and took a deep breath.The inspector who took Haren\u2019s blood sent an ok sign. As Bahil said, he wasn\u2019t caught for doping.\u2018Haaaah! Power is overwhelming in my body.\u2019It was hard to express\u2026\u2026 how he currently felt.Haren had always lived a life of chasing after someone\u2019s back.But now, it was different. He felt like the whole world was under his feet. It seemed that he could overthrow anyone if he had the will to do so.\u2018\u2026\u2026Simon Polentia.\u2019Class A\u2019s Special Admission No.1. The special admission among special admissions.He was already fed up with the special admission students. They were all arrogant and violent, including the Special Admission No.8 from Class G, Haren\u2019s class.Those people living in luxury thanks to their parents had never gone hungry, received tremendous support, and were born with genes full of talent, even if they didn\u2019t put in much effort.\u2018Watch me.\u2019He knew that most of the scouts who were watching from the audience came to see Simon.However, after this Duel Evaluation was over, they\u2019d change their minds. The whole continent would pay attention to him.And Haren\u2019s gaze moved to one side of the audience. At the end of the audience, Bahil, wearing a white suit, was also watching the match.\u2018\u2026\u2026He said that it\u2019s fine as long as I don\u2019t kill him, right?\u2019Haren couldn\u2019t give up this power. He wanted to continue getting Bahil\u2019s support, and for this, he was planning to somehow become a direct disciple of Bahil.\u2018I\u2019ll at least destroy one of your limbs.\u2019He struggled and seized this opportunity that those born into rich families would enjoy forever.It was probably a once in a lifetime chance.He won\u2019t miss it again. He\u2019d do it, no matter the means.[Simon Polentia from Class A. Please come to the Stadium.]However, the opponent was a little late.Now, there were broadcasts looking for Simon resounding throughout the school, not only in the 2nd Stadium.\u2018\u2026\u2026Being late? All special admissions are like this, after all.\u2019Haren folded his arms. The referee in charge of the match looked at his watch.\u201cWe\u2019re getting delayed. If he doesn\u2019t come within 5 minutes, Simon Polentia will be disqualified. We\u2019ll count this duel as a win for Haren Cork.\u201dThere were shouts of disappointment and the clicking of tongues from everywhere.Meilyn and Camibarez stamped their feet. No matter which way you looked at it, something must\u2019ve happened. If Rick couldn\u2019t find him, nobody could.Five minutes passed in the blink of an eye, and the referee checking the watch said,\u201cTime\u2019s up. This match is Haren Cor\u2014\u201d\u201cHold up!\u201dPoow!The waiting room door opened at a dramatic moment, revealing Simon with hollow-looking eyes and Rick supporting him.\u201cOhhh!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201dAt the fact that the big match hadn\u2019t been canceled, the scouts and students who were waiting all smiled.\u201cSimon!\u201dYou dumbass!!\u201dCamibarez and Meilyn waved in great relief. Simon also noticed them and raised his hand slightly to signal to them that he was okay.\u201cI can walk by myself, Rick.\u201d\u201cGood grief.\u201dRick released the support and slapped Simon on the back.\u201cDo well.\u201dSimon walked to the stadium and bowed his head at the referee.\u201cForgive me for being late.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. Please get ready fast.\u201dThe servants who were waiting rushed in and put a protection suit on Simon and collected his blood.Preparation for the Duel Evaluation ended quickly.\u201cBoth players, shake hands.\u201dSimon and Haren met in the middle and held their hands, following the referee\u2019s orders.Simon smiled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being late.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHaren didn\u2019t say anything and looked at Simon\u2019s condition.A sullen face, huge bags under his eyes, and a school uniform covered in dirt.\u2018His condition is clearly fucked up. It should be an easy win.\u2019After shaking hands, the two stood a distance apart. The screen spread out from the mana projector.[Simon Polentia: 100%][Haren Cork: 100%]\u201cThe match is over when either side loses consciousness, or their barrier gauge drops to 0%.\u201dThe two nodded and took a stance.In an instant, tension was built throughout the stadium.Meilyn and Camibarez were also waiting, leaning forward in their seats. Rick came up to the audience stand and approached them while sweating profusely.\u201cRick! Good work!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Where was Simon at?\u201dThere was dirt all over Rick\u2019s uniform. Rick sat down and brushed off the dirt.\u201cSimon was at the back of the stadium.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. For now, let\u2019s watch.\u201dSimon, in the stadium, closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\u201cPheeeeeeew.\u201dAnd when he opened his eyes again, his concentration was back to normal.\u2018Monstrous bastard.\u2019Haren gave a wry smile and further lowered his stance. The referee\u2019s raised arm dropped down.\u201cBegin!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64\u201cBegin the duel!\u201dSimon immediately pulled on the imaginary lever. Three skeletons with weapons jumped out of the subspace.Haren drew a magic circle with jet-black behind his back. After a while, with the sound of a splatter, the demon\u2019s arm made of jet-black soared.It was his specialty, \u2018Black Hand\u2019.\u2018Simon Polentia, I\u2019ve prepared the perfect strategy for you.\u2019Haren smirked while moving the Black Hand to respond in any kind of situation.\u2018He\u2019s a Summoning aspirant, but his most threatening skill is Combat Magic. I just have to avoid approaching him.\u2019Simon was a slightly different case from the general notion of a Summoner. The most common strategy would be to avoid the skeletons and directly target the caster, but Simon was also good at Combat Magic.It\u2019d be dangerous to recklessly go into close combat.\u2018He\u2019ll probably attack me with a skeleton and induce me to charge. I won\u2019t let that happen easily.\u2019Haren kept the distance and didn\u2019t move an inch. It was Simon who made the first move.\u2018He\u2019s coming\u2026\u2026!\u2019Haren was watching him with a tense face, but Simon wasn\u2019t coming forward. Rather, he was stepping backward.Tap. Tap.He continued to step backward. The same went for the skeletons guarding him. While maintaining their formation, they backed off so far that the front of the formation now stood where the back was.\u2018\u2026\u2026What is he trying to do now?\u2019Haren\u2019s eyebrow twitched.Haren kept on watching him to see how far he would retreat, and Simon went all the way to the end of the Stadium.The wall was now at his back. It was as if he had cornered himself.\u2018I don\u2019t know what kind of strategy you\u2019ve prepared, but\u2026 I can use ranged attacks too.\u2019Haren floated the jet-black magic circles in the air. Four jet-black arrows were rapidly being formed, nearing completion.\u201cHuh? What? What\u2019s going on?!\u201dRick, who was watching the match from the audience seat, jumped up.\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be able to use other dark spells while maintaining the Black Hand, though?\u201dHowever, Haren, who proudly completed the magic circle, shot out the jet-black arrows.Simon reacted quickly too. Three shields came out of the subspace of the floor, and the skeletons threw away their swords, grabbing a shield with both hands.\u2018Block it!\u2019Skeletons ran towards the jet-black arrows while putting their shields in front.Clonk! Clonk! Cloooonk!A sound of the impact rang out. The skeletons were pushed back, but they managed to guard it stably.\u2018Look at this bastard now, hm?\u2019The corners of Haren\u2019s lips went up. His gaze was directed towards the weapons the skeletons had thrown to the floor.\u2018He has no intention of attacking at all now. Is that it?\u2019Simon stepped back, and the skeletons threw their weapons.Haren, feeling puzzled, thoroughly observed Simon\u2019s appearance.A dark-blue jet-black was rising from Simon\u2019s right arm, and although it wasn\u2019t a magic circle, it seemed like he was preparing something. Or even this could have just been an act\u2026\u2018If you have no intentions of attacking, then\u2026\u2026!\u2019Haren spread his palms out. The jet-black that flowed from the bottom of his hand began to draw a Curse magic circle.Originally, it was a curse that couldn\u2019t be used at Haren\u2019s level, but it became possible with Bahil\u2019s surgery.Bahil\u2019s hidden technique, which allowed you to recreate a magic circle using jet-black\u2019s property of recreating magic circles without needing knowledge or proficiency.Haren stretched out his hand as the magic circle was completed.\u2018Sickness!\u2019A black curse flew like lightning from the magic circle.The skeletons jumped in front of Simon to block the curse, but it easily passed through the undeads\u2019 bodies and pierced Simon\u2019s chest.\u201c\u2026\u2026Kugh!\u201dHis vision spun. Simon knelt down to a knee as nausea welled up.A Sickness curse. It was known to be pretty effective when dealing with Combat Magic aspirants.\u2018S-Something like this is a sickness?\u2019Simon\u2019s head spun, and the world split into three, rocking back and forth.Simon clenched his teeth and got a grip on himself.\u201cOh.\u201dHaren smiled.\u201cUsually, you\u2019d lose your fighting will after getting hit by that, but by the looks of it\u2026 You\u2019re going to continue?\u201dSimon, sweating profusely, raised the corner of his lips instead of answering him.While thinking that it was a very annoying smile, Haren moved the Black Hand.Wooooosh!The devil\u2019s arm extending out from his back swung like a whip. Simon sent skeletons with shields in front of him.Pooow!Two skeletons were flung away with ease. The hand changed its direction again in mid-air and swung toward Simon.Despite feeling a terrible sickness, Simon formed jet-black on his right foot and jumped into the air.\u2018Th-This is crazy, for real!\u2019He dodged the attack, but his sickness and nausea got worse when he jumped. Simon wiped his lips while landing on the floor.\u2018You paltry bastard\u2026\u2026!\u2019Haren moved the Black Hand again. Simon frantically rolled around the floor to dodge the attack that bent freely and swung like a whip.Haren\u2019s one-sided offense continued.\u201cWhat are you doing?! Simon!\u201dMeilyn stood from her seat and shouted,\u201cAttack! You should fight back!\u201d\u201cHey, you, the student in front. Please remain silent!\u201dMeilyn blushed at the voice she heard from the back seat and bowed her head. It was a rare opportunity where Rick could make fun of Meilyn, but Rick was sweating profusely while watching Simon\u2019s battle.\u201c\u2026\u2026Something\u2019s off. Something\u2019s really off.\u201d\u201cHey, Rick.\u201dMeilyn glanced at him.\u201cThe information you got, none of it was correct! You said he can\u2019t use any other dark spells while using Black Hand, didn\u2019t you? And you said that the maximum length of Black Hand is around 2 meters, right? None of that was correct!\u201dRick scratched his head.\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t get it! Did he hide his powers? Is he actually a geek who concealed his power?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you mean?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201dShouted Rick.\u201cWhat\u2019s certain is that Haren Cork right now is many times stronger than as he\u2019s known to the public!\u201dSlaaam!Simon covered his mouth while avoiding the Black Hand that swung like a whip.\u201c\u2026\u2026Dammit, you\u2019re hella good at dodging.\u201dSaid Haren Cork while huffing. Before Simon knew it, a new Sickness magic circle was being prepared in Haren\u2019s left hand.\u201cBut it\u2019s all over once this gets completed. Let\u2019s see if you can still stand on 2 stacks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA clear taunt.Haren came closer and closer while needling Simon\u2019s nerves.He deliberately swung the Black Hand at a wide-angle to appear that his guard was down and to trick Simon into rushing in, but Simon didn\u2019t use Combat Magic to the very end.He just silently brought out new skeletons to replace the shattered skeletons.It was strange. It was clearly Haren himself who was taking the lead.The first curse had hit, and the next curse was almost complete.However\u2026\u2018What in the world are you preparing?!\u2019It was Haren who was feeling pressed.Thummp!Baaang!\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019On the other hand, Bahil was in the audience stands, watching silently with his arms crossed.As he expected, the match was one-sided.\u201cInteresting.\u201dBahil turned his head and murmured,\u201cIsn\u2019t this the first time you\u2019ve come to see a first-year\u2019s duel, Senior?\u201dAaron in a shirt and shorts came up into the audience stand from the stairs. He tried to pass by Bahil without saying a word.\u201cA sense of guilt.\u201dAaron stopped.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the reason why you aren\u2019t taking any direct disciples, Senior? Since you know exactly what kind of hardship you\u2019ll go through if you choose Summoning. Most of your disciples also changed their major without overcoming those hardships, so you shouldn\u2019t be able to take it any longer.\u201dBahil shrugged his shoulders.\u201cAnd you\u2019re feeling greedy after all that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron looked back at Bahil with a cold gaze.Bahil smiled without avoiding his gaze.\u201cTake a look.\u201dBahil spread his hand out.\u201cSee what kind of situation our disciple is facing now.\u201dNow, Haren was actively closing his distance and wielding his Black Hand.Simon was focused on blocking and dodging, devoting himself only to defending.The shield that the skeletons were holding eventually got destroyed. With Haren\u2019s follow-up, the skeleton was broken, but Simon persistently revived it with Restoration.\u201cWhen Haren\u2019s second Sickness is complete, this match will be over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I wrong, Senior?\u201dAaron silently looked down at the match between Simon and Haren. Then, he turned his back and went down the stairs he had come up earlier.\u201cSenior, where are you going?\u201d\u201cThe match is already over.\u201dAaron turned to Bahil and added another sentence.\u201cI came here just in case, but there\u2019s no need for me to watch anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dBahil looked at the back of the leaving Aaron, puzzled.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Slaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!The stadium was covered with dust from Haren\u2019s attack. Haren gasped heavily, his face red.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand Simon\u2019s strategy at all. Jet-black continued to rise on Simon\u2019s right arm, but that wasn\u2019t a magic circle or anything.\u2018Nah, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary for me to know that. Now it\u2019ll be over!\u2019Haren stretched out his right hand.The second Sickness hit Simon as he lost his balance while dodging the Black Hand.\u2018Ooof!\u2019Simon felt like his surroundings were being terribly twisted. The feeling of dizziness and vomiting pushed him to his limit.He wasn\u2019t in a state where he could fight at all.\u201cHow is it? Doesn\u2019t it feel like shit, Special Admission No.1?\u201dHaren smiled with his teeth.\u201cYou obviously came here to completely beat me up, but it\u2019s not that easy, right? You\u2019re crawling on the floor. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing obvious in this world.\u201dSimon stood up slowly, resting his left hand on his forehead.\u201cPhewww.\u201dThe jet-black that was lingering in Simon\u2019s right hand disappeared. Haren\u2019s smile deepened.\u201cYou gave up. Planning to surrender?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSimon slowly brought his hand to his neck, relaxing his muscles. You could hear bones popping.\u201cIt\u2019s now complete. Time for me to fight back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201dWas it the one that he\u2019d been preparing for all this time?Haren hurriedly turned his head and looked around the stadium.There was no change in Simon or the stadium, or the condition of his own body. It wasn\u2019t a curse, nor a hallucination.\u2018This bastard, bluffing till the end\u2026\u2026!\u2019\u201cDid you know?\u201dSimon clenched his fist and punched the air in front of him.Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom!\u201cWoah!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dThe whole stadium was shaken hard.Screams broke loose from all over the audience seats, and people looked around in shock.Simon pulled his fist back with an expressionless face, then punched again.\u201cDetailed rules for Duel Evaluation. Article 3, Section 4.\u201dBooooooooooooom!\u201cStudents participating in the Duel Evaluation will be disqualified if they leave the stadium during Evaluation.\u201dBoooooooooooooooooooom!Haren\u2019s eyes widened.A crack in the shape of a giant fist was being formed on the stadium wall behind Simon\u2019s back.\u201cBut no matter how much I looked at the rules, there was nothing that forbade bringing anything from outside the stadium.\u201dSlaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!Finally, the walls of the stadium were smashed through, crumbling down.You could see the view outside. The referee, the officials, and the spectators all opened their mouths.Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!Something huge from outside was breaking into the stadium. Every time that huge leg hit the floor, it created a crack in the stadium floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hah.\u201dHaren let out a feigned smile.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Kuhugh! Hah! Hahahahah! You fucking crazy bastard!!\u201dA huge summon with a large body made by the agglomeration of soil and mud centering on a \u2018core\u2019 that had Summoning magic applied to it.The symbol of a Summoner.Haren desperately shouted at the relaxed Simon,\u201cThis is a first-year Duel Eval! Fucking shit! What kind of\u2014?! Why is a golem coming out of here?!!!\u201dSummon Mud Golem.It was Summoning magic that gathered soil around the golem\u2019s core and shaped it into a form of a golem.Woooooooaaaaaaah\u2026!A first-year who brought a golem to the first Duel Evaluation! The crowd was completely turned upside down.Meilyn and Camibarez also opened their mouths. Rick feigned a laugh like Haren.\u201cWhen I went out to look for Simon. He was burying the golem\u2019s core in the back of the stadium. Simon was thinking of creating a golem from the start.\u201dMeilyn turned her head.\u201cI mean, let\u2019s say the skeleton archers are understandable, but is it possible for a first-year student to make a golem?!\u201dRick shrugged.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at it right now.\u201dOf course, the shock that Haren received was greater than anyone else\u2019s\u201cThis is ridiculous! No way! Referee! Isn\u2019t that someone else\u2019s summon? He should be disqualified as a violation of\u2014!\u201dThe referee shook his head coldly.\u201cThat summon is moving with the jet-black of student Simon. It\u2019s his golem.\u201dSimon, who buried the golem\u2019s core at the back of the stadium, headed to the place where it was buried as soon as the duel started. Of course, it would\u2019ve seemed like Simon backing off and running away from Haren.Then he went out on full defense and began to complete the golem beyond the wall. Since it was placed outside, there was no fear of the core being attacked.And like that, without any visual help, he activated the core of the golem with jet-black and attacked the soil around it to create the golem.\u201cNow,\u201dSimon smiled.\u201cit\u2019s my turn now, right?\u201dThump! Thump! Thump! Thump!The golem began to charge at a frightening speed when Simon gave the order.Contrary to its gigantic, seemingly sluggish size, it was fast, faster than he expected. While experiencing the tension of facing the giant monster alone, Haren\u2019s fists were tightened with nerves.\u2018Dammit\u2026\u2026!\u2019Life was unfair.People were born with different things.Talent. Wealth. Rank. Flesh. Race. Nationality. He knew. So he wanted to destroy it as a commoner without talent. He wanted to prove what value he could create when given the chance.However\u2026!\u2018A golem is too much\u2026\u2026!\u2019A wall of enormous talent that was hardly imaginable.For Haren, Simon standing behind the golem felt much higher and bigger than the golem itself.\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dHaren ran out while letting out a scream of desperation.It was now do or die.He stepped off the floor and flew into the air, spinning. He then threw out his Black Hand with all his might. The air cracked violently, and a demon\u2019s fist slammed into the golem\u2019s chest.Thuud.However, the golem\u2019s body didn\u2019t even move an inch. A little pile of dirt fell, and the Black Hand\u2019s arm bent like a soft jelly.\u201cStraight punches are\u2026\u201d You could see Simon pulling his fist behind the golem. \u201cthrown with your weight in them.\u201dAs Simon threw a punch, the golem connected with Simon\u2019s thoughts also threw its huge arm.Thuuuuuuuuuuuuunk!The world shook.Haren\u2019s body flew at the speed of light after being hit by the golem\u2019s punch, reaching the other side of the stadium and crashing into a wall. The smashed walls caved in like a crater, and cracks appeared all over the stadium.A wild wind like a runaway horse blew, and everyone in the audience seat had to curl themselves up.\u201cPhewwww.\u201dSimon slowly lowered his arm. The curse that Haren had placed on him was lifted, and his sight returned to normal.[Simon Polentia: 76%][Haren Cork: 0%]The referee, who was blanking out, belatedly came back to his senses and stretched out his hand. Sweat was glistening on his forehead.\u201cThe winner is\u2026 Simon Polentia of Class A!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65\u201cThe winner is\u2026 Simon Polentia of Class A!\u201dCheers both big and small broke loose from the audience. Rather than enthusiastic, the cheers were closer to stupefied ones.\u201c\u2026\u2026Awesome.\u201d\u201cAs expected from the Special Admission No.1\u201d\u201cWhere is that guy planning to go? When we graduate, let us\u2014\u201d\u201cOh my, brother. I don\u2019t think Kizen will let him go if he has that much skill.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been since an ace appeared from a Summoning aspirant? That\u2019s quite interesting.\u201dWhile officials from various institutions and organizations were exchanging their opinions, the students in the front seats suddenly stood up.\u201cSimoooon! Well done! You\u2019re the best!\u201d\u201cUgh, honestly! Putting people\u2019s hearts in their mouths!\u201d\u201cThat was a great big picture! Bwahaha!\u201dCamibarez, Meilyn, and Rick were shouting and waving. Simon also smiled and waved as he saw those three.An official of an organization crossed his arms.\u201cOur kids are looking cute.\u201d\u201cOh, brother. By that, you mean\u2014\u201d\u201cOh, you crazy bastard! They are my juniors!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Right. You\u2019re from Kizen, after all.\u201dAfter waving to his group mates, Simon turned his head. Haren, who was stuck in the wall, fell, and the medical staff carried him on a stretcher.Hearing what the medical staff said, he had no injuries thanks to the protective suit, but his body was startled by the big shock.Haren also was blinking his eyes with a blank expression on his face.\u201cHaren.\u201dSimon approached him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of reason you got for hating me, but\u2026\u201dSimon smiled and continued.\u201cYou can never defeat me with such a power when it isn\u2019t yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dHaren strained his eyes upon hearing that.\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s go.\u201dHaren, whose face turned pale, was carried away on his stretcher.Simon lightly brushed off his hands and turned his back. When he saw the wind blowing from one side of the wall of the indoor stadium, he belatedly felt embarrassed.\u2018I know it can be fixed quickly with magic, but I feel bad.\u2019Disassembling the golem here would cause even more trouble, so Simon took it out of the stadium.In the meantime, the referee proceeded to the next match.\u201cSimon!\u201dBefore he knew it, Camibarez and his groupmates were running out of the stadium.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cHey! What\u2019s wrong with you?! You scared us!! You never told us anything!\u201dSimon awkwardly laughed at Meilyn\u2019s shouting.\u201cSorry for making you worry.\u201d\u201cAh, what?! I never worried about you or anything!\u201dOn the other side, Rick approached the mud golem with a look of admiration.\u201cDammnn. So this is Simon\u2019s golem!\u201dAs Rick tried to reach out and touch the golem, the golem leaned back and glared at Rick. Rick flinched and stepped back.\u201cHello? Good boy~\u201dThis time, Camibarez approached and stroked the golem.The golem didn\u2019t refuse her touch. Rather, it bent its body slightly and took a posture to make it easier for her to stroke it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRick made a bitter face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026That bastard might not be a golem.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cSimon! Can I try riding on this?\u201dAsked Camibarez, eyes twinkling. Simon was just smiling while sweating profusely.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cCami.\u201dSaid Meilyn as she ran her hand through her hair.\u201cMaintaining a Golem consumes jet-black. I believe Simon will be dried up and dead in a little while.\u201d\u201cAh! Ahh! I\u2019m sorry! I was being insensitive\u2026\u2026!\u201dCamibarez quickly hopped off the golem.Simon then finally let go of the connection and stopped the operation of the golem, it collapsing like a mountain of dirt.Simon approached the mountain of dirt and pulled out a large, marble-like object. This was the golem\u2019s core.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it looks like, huh?\u201dCamibarez and Meilyn squatted down and carefully touched the core.Then a\u00a0ting\u00a0came from the surface of the core. Camibarez let out a short scream and backed away.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dSaid Simon with a smile.\u201cSometimes it pulls pranks when it\u2019s in a good mood.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, isn\u2019t this super expensive? How did you attain it?\u201dSimon smirked at Meilyn\u2019s question.\u201cI somehow got it with the money I earned from the mission and getting it on my tab.\u201dSimon earned 500 gold from the last mission, and in return for clearing a mountain range and dealing with the gray orcs, he received 200 gold as an additional commission fee from Lord Raymond.And a few days ago, when he went down to Rochest to buy a skeleton archer, Simon used 90 gold to buy three sets of skeleton archers.He had 610 gold left after that.\u201cThe golem core starts off at least 700 Gold.\u201dWith the words of the shop owner, Simon was about to give up.Then, the shop owner made a new offer.\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t really a cheap item, so I\u2019ll give you a special discount and make it 650 gold and have 50 of that gold go on a tab. Why don\u2019t you take it with you for 600 gold?\u201dCompletely taken by the shop owner\u2019s words, Simon ended up purchasing the golem core.\u2018It feels like I spent too much, but eh.\u2019Still, the golem did its money\u2019s worth. Even ignoring the combat power, it was worthwhile because, unlike skeletons, it could be used for a long time.Simon carefully put the core back into the subspace.\u201cBy the way, Rick, when\u2019s our next mission period?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s with that all of a sudden?\u201dHe wanted to go out again and earn money.Necromancy was all about money. Simon smiled as he thought about it.* * *All the morning-session Duel Evaluations were over.After having a light lunch, Simon and his friends moved to the 4th Stadium, where Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez would be taking their Duel Evaluations.Rick, who was first to duel, went to the waiting room to prepare.\u201cCami, are you sure you\u2019ll be fine without eating anything?\u201dAsked Simon.Perhaps because of the tension from the upcoming Duel, she was giving a tough smile while curled up into a ball.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s fine. I can\u2019t really eat anything right now.\u201d\u201cWhat about you? Are you really alright?\u201dMeilyn folded her arms and stared at Simon.\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself to watch our match. Just go to sleep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m okay. My tiredness went away because of the duel earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Good grief.\u201d\u201cAh, there, Rick\u2019s coming out!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *It was as Camibarez said. Rick, wearing a protective suit, was walking toward the center of the arena, the opposing student entering too.Rick\u2019s opponent was a female student named Legang Chopra. She had dark-brown hair tied into a ponytail, and a bit of a dark complexion.\u201cEh, another female opponent, huh?\u201dMuttered Rick while supporting the back of his head with his arms. Hearing that, Legang quickly frowned.\u201cWhat did you just say? I\u2019ll beat the shit out of you, so you just wait.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright.\u201dRick gave a sly smile and shook her hand. As the two of them stood a distance apart, the mana projector displayed the barrier gauges.[Rick Hayward: 100%][Legang Chopra: 100%]\u201cAre the two of you ready?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe referee nodded.\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll begin the Duel Evaluation between Rick Hayward and Legang Chopra.\u201dThe referee lowered his arm.\u201cBegin the duel!\u201dRick immediately opened his subspace, took out a sleek sword, and held it in his hand.\u2018Enchant.\u2019A magic circle spread out on the sword, and the sword was dyed black. Rick took his fighting stance after swinging it lightly.\u201cJust that?\u201dLegang scoffed and opened her subspace. A whopping twenty swords came out and scattered onto the floor.Clamors of wonder broke loose from the entire audience.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Can she even use all of them?\u201dMeilyn and Camibarez also added their opinions.A magic circle spread over the bundle of swords at that moment, and the swords all began to turn black at once.\u2018Multiple enchantments\u2026\u2026!\u2019It was coincidentally a battle between enchanters.Rick looked relaxed, even at the sight of twenty swords getting dyed at once. Unlike Legang, he was stacking up enchantments on one sword.\u201cFufu. It seems like you don\u2019t know much about Enchanting. The amount of jet-black you place determines the performance of the enchanted weapon. Multi-enchant is a skill that should be avoided unless you\u2019re at a professional level.\u201d\u201cJust shut up and watch!\u201dLegang opened out her hand. Then, the twenty swords trembled and floated into the air as if alive.Woah\u2026Exclamations and screams broke loose from everywhere. The swords danced as if escorting her.If you looked closely, there was a jet-black string attached to each sword\u2019s tip which was used to lift them up into the air.\u201cDrop dead.\u201dSpat out Legang as she spread her fingers. The three swords floating in the air flew toward Rick at a fierce speed.\u201cHuzzah!\u201dRick ran while stepping on his jet-black, swinging his shortsword.Clang! Clang! Clang!With every sound of metal clashing, sparks flew, and the swords fell to the floor.Swowowowowowop!As though finished aiming, ten swords flew in from different directions this time.\u201cWoah, this one\u2019s gonna be tough!\u201dRick dropped his sword to the floor and pulled out an object with a handle from his subspace. He knelt down on one knee and held it straight in front of him.\u2018Enchant!\u2019Slaaaaaaaaaaaaaash!Rick\u2019s jet-black spread out like an umbrella. The swords flew fiercely and collided in front of it.The deafening sound of clashing metal rang out.The corner of the jet-black shield was torn, unable to block all ten of them. Swords grazed Rick all over.\u201cRick!\u201dCamibarez shouted anxiously and looked at the mana projector\u2019s screen.[Rick Hayward : 69%][Legang Chopra: 100%]Rick, whose barrier gauge had fallen, staggered before stepping back.\u201cWhoa, that was a close one! But now it\u2019s my turn to\u2026\u2026 Hm?\u201dThe swords on the floor trembled and returned to Legang after attacking Rick. Rick opened his mouth and gave a hollow smile.\u201cPretty good~\u201dLegang frowned.\u201cYou still have the energy to talk around like that?\u201d\u201cOf course, of course! Shall I show you how much more I can talk?\u201dRick took a deep breath in.\u201cName, Legang Chopra. And the actual name is Priyanka Chopra.\u201d\u201c!!\u201dLegang\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cA native of Shahed Kingdom\u2019s Depack territory. The Chopra surname was your mother\u2019s, and the core was developed by the town\u2019s wise man. It took 1 year from developing the core to your first jet-black, and your specialty is hunting. Cooking is your hobby.\u201d\u201cWh-What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cAfter entering Kizen, you were placed in Class G, the average score of your subject tests is around 70, and the first friend you made was Narsha Abra. You\u2019re a Mechanics of Jet-Black aspirant but are starting to have some interest in Combat Magic. You have a minor injury on your knee. Your height is 163 cm, weight is 61kg, waist size is\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up, you crazy bastard!\u201dShouted Legang Chopra as her face turned all red.Embarrassed by the fact that they were in the same group, Meilyn covered her face with her palms, and Camibarez lowered her head.\u201cKeep your friends close and your enemies closer.\u201dRick smiled and opened his subspace, five metal stakes sticking out. He took one and nailed it to the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s my creed. First of all, I know better than anyone else that I\u2019m weak, you know~ So I\u2019m very interested in knowing others.\u201d\u201cStop talking and just die already!\u201dLegang launched ten swords at once. Rick placed his palm on the metal stake and infused his mana on it.\u2018Enchant!\u2019Mana got into the metal stake. Then, all the swords flying toward Rick started sticking to the stake.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s some sort of electromagnet. If you activate it with jet-black, it absorbs metal of the same properties. Your swords are a mixture of carbon steel and amarinium, right?\u201d\u201cH-How did you find that out\u2026\u2026?!\u201dRick pulled out a note from his pocket, opened it, and smiled.\u201cThis is a list of things you bought from the Rochest weapon shop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cApparently, you purchased twenty swords as soon as you got the money from this mission period. And there\u2019s something else that you can know with this information.\u201dRick tossed the note behind his back and rummaged through his pockets, pulling out a single silver coin. The coin was dyed black, seemingly enchanted.\u201cLooks like you didn\u2019t buy any shields or armor, huh?\u201dRick spread out two magic circles, one across the palm of his right hand, and one on the coin. Then, he clenched his fist tightly after making the two magic circles face each other.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you lowered your guard because I\u2019m a pure enchanter, but in that case\u2026\u2026!\u201dRick raised his left leg as he raised his arms behind his head. Soon, he landed on the floor and naturally shifted his center of gravity forward.At the same time, the palm of his right arm, which he flung forward and spread out, the two magic circles contacting making a spark.\u201cYou should be vulnerable to accelerating ranged attacks!\u201dSheeeeeeeeeeeeewk!The coin shot out like a flash of light, creating a fierce sonic wave.\u2018\u2026\u2026I-It\u2019s fast! I can\u2019t dodge it.\u2019Legang hurriedly moved the surrounding swords in front of her, but the coin was faster. It pushed through and crashed into her forehead.Pooooow!A shockwave splashed off, starting from her forehead and rippling out. It was blocked by the barrier of the protective suit, but her eyes rolled back from the momentary shock to her head.Thud!Her body fell to the floor.[Rick Hayward: 69%][Legang Chopra: 35%]The power of the enchanted coin wasn\u2019t enough to defeat her in one hit, but Legang lost consciousness from the shock. The referee checked her condition and said,\u201cMatch is over! Legang Chopra has lost consciousness. It\u2019s Rick Hayward\u2019s victory!\u201d\u201cKyahah!\u201dRick clenched his fists with a joyful smile.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Rick\u2019s match wasn\u2019t that flashy, but it had that kind of fun where you felt immersed and absorbed.Simon and Camibarez were also applauding from the audience seat, but Meilyn was resting her chin on her hand with a sour expression on her face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, I\u2019m sure that our groupmate won, but why do I feel so embarrassed?\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d[Meilyn Villenne from Class A. Ivan Varshani from Class C. Please proceed to the waiting room.]Hearing the announcement, Meilyn stood up.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll come back with an easy win.\u201cGo Meilyn! Go!\u201d\u201cDo well.\u201dAs Meilyn headed to the waiting room, she ran into Rick coming up to the audience seat.Rick raised his hand to give a high-five, saying, \u201cYeah~\u201d, seemingly in a good mood, but Meilyn scoffed and passed by him.\u201cTsk! I swear she doesn\u2019t even have the faintest amount of sociability.\u201dGrumbled Rick as he approached Simon and Camibarez, high fiving them.While the three of them were happily discussing the Duel Evaluation, you could see Meilyn walking toward the middle of the stadium.Meilyn\u2019s opponent was Ivan Varshani from Class C. He was a Combat Magic aspirant with a strong body.\u201cLooks like this match will be a fun one too.\u201dSaid Rick while sticking his hands in his pockets.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Ivan sticks close to Meilyn, or Meilyn bats him away before he does.\u201d\u201cYou can do it, Meilyn!\u201dFollowing the referee\u2019s instruction, Meilyn and Ivan approached each other and shook hands.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to go against such a big shot in just my first duel.\u201dSmiled Ivan.\u201cIt\u2019d be better to remember this moment as an honor for your family, commoner.\u201dMeilyn took her hand back and folded her arms arrogantly.\u201cBecause later, you won\u2019t even be able to look me in the eye.\u201d\u201cMm, yeah. However, I believe it\u2019ll be a good experience for you to be trampled by a commoner now.\u201cHow funny.\u201dAfter having a light war of nerves, the two turned their backs and walked away.Formerly a boxer, Ivan\u2019s body was made up of compressed muscles through numerous trainings and exercises.Meanwhile Meilyn\u2019s physique was soft and thin, like she had never dirtied her hands in her life.The two finally stood face to face at a distance. The referee, who checked the condition of the two students, lowered his arm and shouted,\u201cBegin the duel!\u201dAs soon as the match began, Ivan stamped on the floor and rushed toward Meilyn.\u2018Push her to the limit so she won\u2019t be able to do anything\u2026\u2026!\u2019Then, his eyes widened. Dark flames suddenly erupted in front of him.Flaaaaaash!Ivan hurriedly hit the brake and swerved.It was a close one. He was wearing a protective suit, but sweat dripped off from the burning heat.\u201cOh my, how simple.\u201dSaid Meilyn while raising a Dark Flame to the tip of her index finger.\u201cDid you really think that this is a stage where you could win with stupid, pre-emptive attacks?\u201dFlash!The battle flowed to the point where Meilyn continuously poured flames and Ivan tried to avoid them, looking for an opening.Watching from the audience, Simon exclaimed in admiration,\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. She managed to finish Dark Flare that quickly?\u201d\u201cNah.\u201dRick shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s jet-black elemental magic that\u2019s at a lower level than Dark Flare. Dark Flare takes more time to cast.\u201dThe jet-black elemental system.It was a modern, jet-black recreation of the elemental magic of the now non-existent pure mages. Its unique characteristic was that, whether it was fire or ice, it had a slightly blackish tinge.Even if a pure mage and a Necromancer cast magic at the same time, the jet-black elemental system would complete it much faster. The power was also stronger, and you had more advantages when controlling the variables.Indeed, a complete superior.\u201cAs expected from the Ivory Tower.\u201dThe Ivory tower used to be a holy land for mages, once being called the \u2018Tower of Magic\u2019.However, it had also changed as it went along with the trends, and in current times, Necromancers were the mainstream.But perhaps because their original character still remained, most of the Necromancers of the Ivory Tower were good at jet-black elemental magic using the Mechanics of Jet-Black.Of course, that was also true for Meilyn.\u201cHaaaah!\u201dAs Meilyn swung her arm, flames stretched out like a wall and blocked Ivan\u2019s path. Ivan dodged by a hair\u2019s breadth and gasped for breath.[Meilyn Villenne: 100%][Ivan Varshani: 71%]\u2018That\u2019s definitely tricky. I was only dodging, but my gauge is already like this\u2026\u2026\u2019Ivan wiped his lips with his hand and doubled the amount of jet-black within his body, it getting hotter and hotter.\u2018There\u2019s nothing to be nervous about. Just keep distracting her and stop her from using big dark spells. Just once. If I just get one chance\u2026\u2026!\u2019\u201cI told you a while ago, right, Commoner?\u201dMeilyn smiled and raised left hand that she hid behind her back.Fwoooooooooooosh!\u201cThat you\u2019re simple.\u201dA Dark Flame incomparable to the previous ones in size rose up from her left hand.Ivan\u2019s mouth widened.\u2018Wh-When did she complete that Dark Flare?!\u2019Actually, it was only recently that Meilyn learnt to multi-cast Dark Flare.She slowly prepared a Dark Flare with her left hand while firing a light jet-black flame spell with her right.With this growth, she, the top of the class, had made a step closer to perfection.Now that she finished the Dark Flare, it was unnecessary for her to do small pokes.Meilyn let her right hand hang down and made the flame on her left bigger.\u201cThe game is over. Do you wanna go on?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s too early for you to say something like that!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Ivan\u2019s lips twisted. His heart beat madly, and his blood was boiling.\u2018No matter how strong the dark spell is, it\u2019s no use if it doesn\u2019t hit!\u2019Ivan stamped on the floor and launched himself. It was quite a speed, seemingly creating afterimages.As Meilyn was about to swing her left hand straight ahead, Ivan\u2019s body twisted in the opposite direction.She flinched and withdrew her hand. If she had continued to cast it, she would\u2019ve wasted the Dark Flare that took so much effort.\u2018Hehe. You won\u2019t ever be able to throw that!\u2019Ivan was skilled in using jet-black on his body to enhance his speed, even when compared to many Combat Magic aspirants. He was confident that he\u2019d be faster than anyone else in Kizen during these 1-2 minutes of raising his tempo to the maximum.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Ivan circled around Meilyn as if toying with her.Meilyn was moving her head and body diligently with her Dark Flare in front, but she could hardly catch Ivan.\u2018Do you get it, noble? The skill level of dark magic and victory in an actual battle are two completely different things!\u2019Ivan stopped accelerating in an instant, found Meilyn\u2019s back, and rushed in like a flash of light.His fist, which had been strengthened by the jet-black, was directed towards the back of Meilyn\u2019s head. Sensing victory, the corners of Ivan\u2019s lips were raised into a smirk.\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019However\u2026Meilyn\u2019s shoulders naturally twisted, and her head tilted to the side.\u2018She reacted to this?!\u2019His fist cut through air, and Meilyn and Ivan\u2019s eyes crossed.She smiled proudly.\u201cDid you think that my Combat Magic was weak?\u201dThe boiling Dark Flame on her left hand engulfed Ivan\u2019s body in an instant.Fwooooossssshhhhh!The two crossed before falling apart.The explosions were so loud and the heat so great that the audience members seated close had to cover their faces.[Meilyn Villenne: 94%][Ivan Varshani: 0%]The referee raised his arm.\u201cThe match is over! It\u2019s Meilyn Villenne\u2019s victory!\u201dFwoosh!Ivan, engulfed in dark flames, was kneeling on the floor with a look of disbelief. Meilyn smiled as she combed her hair back behind her ear.\u201cTry harder~ commoner in the lower squad.\u201dApplause and praise poured out from all over the audience for her nearly perfect match operation.\u201cAh\u2026 honestly.\u201dRick giggled.\u201cShe\u2019s so rude, but I can\u2019t talk shit. She\u2019s good.\u201dSimon smiled and nodded.\u201cKizen is only cares about merit, after all.\u201dSimon was also having various thoughts while looking at Meilyn from the audience seat.\u2018If I keep winning the duels one by one, maybe a day will come when I\u2019ll fight against Meilyn, too. Then how should I counter her Dark Flare?\u2019Anyway, starting at some point, his right side was exceptionally quiet. Simon turned his head.Shiver.Camibarez\u2019 legs were trembling, and her face was pale.\u201c\u2026\u2026Cami?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my turn already.\u201dShe fidgeted with her fingers.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon, Rick, and Meilyn all won. If\u2026\u2026 If only I can do as well\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-There\u2019s no need to feel pressured about it.\u201dMeilyn also returned to the audience seat. She looked very excited after just winning the duel, but she didn\u2019t really make it obvious when she saw Camibarez shivering.Two matches passed after Meilyn returned to the audience seat. As time passed, Camibarez\u2019 face grew paler and paler.\u201cGuys! Look over there!\u201dRick pointed to where he was talking about.\u201cIt\u2019s Professor Silage! He probably came to see the ma\u2014!\u201dSimon quickly covered Rick\u2019s mouth, but it was already too late. Meilyn looked at Rick with an exasperated expression.\u201cYou really can\u2019t read the damn mood, huh?\u201dIt was only natural that Silage, a professor in Hemomancy, had an interest in Camibarez, a vampire from the Ursula family.Camibarez\u2019 shivering got worse when she saw Silage, and Rick scratched his head with a sheepish face.[Camibarez Ursula from Class A. Egir Atelier from Class C. Please proceed to the waiting room.]\u201cI-I\u2019ll be going!\u201dShe jumped up from her seat, and the other three consoled her and cheered harder than ever.\u201cWhat kind of style does Egir have?\u201dAsked Simon after Camibarez left. Slowly, Simon started having fun and became interested in this Duel Evaluation.\u201cVery textbook.\u201dRick summed it up neatly.\u201cHe\u2019s not particularly good in any particular field, so I believe he\u2019ll fight by combining various basic skills. I can\u2019t wait to see how Cami, an extremely aggressive Hemomancer, will break through it.\u201d\u201cIn terms of qualification, Cami is outstanding. She\u2019s an Ursula, after all.\u201dMeilyn crossed her arms and said,\u201cThe problem is how well she handles her nervousness\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAfter a while, you could see Camibarez and Egir walking towards the center of the stadium.Egir was a tall, neat-looking male student. The two shook hands as instructed by the referee.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cN-Nice to meet you toooo\u2026\u2026\u201dA very tense face and a voice devoid of all confidence.Egir, who was thinking of the image of violent Ursula vampires, was bewildered by the appearance of a completely different opponent.\u2018Is she really an Ursula?\u2019Watching the slouching girl made him feel a little pitiful, but he could never go easy on her.Soon, the two took a distance from each other and prepared for battle by activating their cores.\u201cAre both of you ready?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dThe referee nodded.\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll begin the Duel Evaluation between Camibarez Ursula and Egir Atelier.\u201dWhile a strained atmosphere was in the air, the referee dropped his arm and shouted,\u201cBegin the duel!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67\u201cBegin the duel!\u201dEgir opened the subspace and pulled out three skeletons as soon as the match began.Camibarez held her right hand like a gun and aimed at Egir. It was the stance for Blood Bullet.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dShe was apologizing to her opponent, even while attacking.A blood-red magic circle spread out at the tip of Camibarez\u2019 index finger, and Blood Bullets shot out, flinging her hand back.\u201cRight. There\u2019s an important characteristic of Egir.\u201dSaid Rick. Just before Camibarez\u2019 exploding Blood Bullet struck Egir, his skeletons blocked the way.Booooooooom!A red explosion engulfed the surroundings. Camibarez hunched over and looked into the smoke.[Camibarez: 100%][Egir: 100%]There was no damage at all.Soon, the smoke cleared up, and three skeletons with large golden shields appeared.\u201cEgir is extremely rich.\u201dSaid Rick while sweeping his bangs back.\u201cHe let his skeletons bring in shields worth several hundred gold, and his summons aren\u2019t just typical skeletons, but Snowfield Gnolls from Vanilla.\u201d\u201cHey! That\u2019s a super important characteristic!\u201d\u201cI obviously told Cami too.\u201dAfter guarding against the ranged attack with an expensive skeleton and shield, Egir floated jet-black arrows in the air and let them loose.\u201cUwah! Aah!\u201dCamibarez jumped around and dodged the attack.At this moment, men and women of all ages watching the match had the same thought.\u2018\u2026\u2026So cute.\u2019\u2018Why is she cute?\u2019She didn\u2019t get hit, but Camibarez fell to the floor looking like she was about to cry as she dodged the last jet-black arrow.The opponent, Egir, changed his mind.\u2018She can move better than she looks. I don\u2019t think I can hit her with jet-black arrows.\u2019Egir retrieved the arrows and drew a new magic circle on the palm of his hand.Rick\u2019s eyes widened when he saw that.\u201cHe\u2019s preparing a curse! Cami! Do something!\u201dCamibarez clenched her teeth and shot Blood Bullets from a kneeling position.However, even if they were exploding Blood Bullets, it was just a simple, linear attack, getting blocked by the skeletons with golden shields.At this rate, the curse would be completed.In the end, she also stopped her attack and began to spread out a new magic circle.Amidst the strained atmosphere, Camibarez and Egir were preparing magic circles, and it naturally flowed into a battle of spells.<Blood Silk>It was Cami who completed their spell first. A carpet of blood fluttered from her fingertips.\u201cUwah, that\u2019s a mistake! What is she gonna do with a spell with no attack power?\u201dScoffed Meilyn before Rick muttered while scratching his head,\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to observe a fight, just watch, dumbass.\u201dCami took out three bottles of potions she made herself from her subspace before wrapping Blood Silk around potion bottles and sending it toward Egir.\u2018Something\u2019s coming.\u2019Egir immediately sent the skeletons and made them swing their swordsSwing!Swiiiiing!However, his control as someone who wasn\u2019t a Summoning aspirant was unsophisticated.It was impossible to stop Cami\u2019s slippery spell with a floundering movement.\u2018A little bit more!\u2019The moment Blood Silk approached right in front of Egir, he also managed to complete the curse.<Bahil Remake \u2013 Paralyze>A curse in the shape of black lightning shot out from the magic circle.Cami was directly hit by the curse, unable to dodge it while controlling the Blood Silk.But she also controlled Blood Silk until the end.The carpet of blood unfolded, and the potion bottles shattered upon hitting Egir\u2019s body.Shatter!It happened almost simultaneously.Egir, drenched in the potion, tried to move his arm, but he couldn\u2019t feel his body.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me, did Camibarez also prepare a paralyze potion?!\u2019Egir frowned as if in a tricky situation, and Camibarez was also panting, legs shaking.Both of them were paralyzed.\u2018Curses and potions. The one that ends first is, of course, the potion. And above all\u2026\u201dWhile sensing victory, Egir flexed his right arm.\u2018I still have skeletons left!\u2019Egir accessed the skeletons\u2019 thoughts and gave an attack order. At the same time, he prepared the next Remade Paralyze spell with his left hand.Camibarez\u2019 response to this was\u2026\u2018\u2026\u20261 stack is still manageable. I can move.\u2019It was a rush. She dragged her paralyzed body and started running.Egir\u2019s skeletons swung their swords to stop her, but Cami dodged the attacks by getting down low, receiving the attacks that she couldn\u2019t dodge and continuing to run.\u2018No way, close combat?\u2019Egir hurriedly stopped casting the curse and floated jet-black arrows in the air.Cami covered her head with both her arms and rushed forward recklessly. Jet-black arrows grazed and scratched her all over.[Camibarez: 58%][Egir: 100%]\u2018She\u2019s rushing in while taking all those?\u2019After feeling the seriousness of the situation, Egir hurriedly gathered jet-black into his fist.He was as good as others in Combat Magic, and he had the confidence not to lose against a small girl in strength.Moreover, both of them were paralyzed.\u201cAhhh!\u201dBut the moment Camibarez got right under his nose, Egir realized something was wrong.Her two pupils were split vertically like the eyes of a beast.Clasp!Cami jumped in, arms wide open, and clung to Egir\u2019s body. Egir staggered and fell to the floor.\u201cWh-What\u2019s going on?!\u201dEgir blushed out of confusion, and Cami opened her mouth. Fangs twinkled and exuded a sharp spirit.Bite!Then, she bit Egir\u2019s neck. Of course, the protective suit\u2019s barrier stopped it from hurting.\u2018I was wondering what she was gonna do, but just a bite?\u2019Egir tried to push Camibarez\u2019s head away with a dumbfounded face, but she didn\u2019t come off easily, sticking to him like a leech.\u201cUgh, hey! What are you doing in this honorable Duel Evalua\u2014! Huh?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *[Camibarez: 58%][Egir: 84%]The gauge went down from just a bite!After belatedly grasping the situation, Egir wrapped jet-black around his fist and violently started hitting her head. However, the bluish barrier was also applied to her, making her gauge drop, but her body was completely unharmed.[Camibarez: 51%][Egir: 64%]\u2018\u2026\u2026No way!\u2019The numbers on the gauge decreased at a tremendous speed. Her biting power was no joke.Panicked, Egir tried to hit at Camibarez and somehow pull her off, but she never gave up.[Camibarez: 43%][Egir: 21%]\u201cThis is crazy! What is this?! Get off me!\u201dIn addition to the effect of the paralyze, it was difficult to focus strength in his fists due to his broken stance.The gauge decreased faster and faster, and in the end\u2026\u201cThe match is over!\u201dShouted the referee. The final result was out.[Camibarez: 37%][Egir. 0%]\u201cThe winner is Camibarez!\u201dEveryone opened their mouths wide at the unexpected development.\u2018\u2026\u2026I-I lost.\u2019Egir had a vacant face.He was confident of his victory the moment they were both paralyzed, but he didn\u2019t expect his guard to be pierced so easily with a single charge.\u2018It\u2019s all because of my negligence in the end. I took her too lightly.\u2019While Egir was sighing inwardly, Camibarez, who was biting his neck, carefully fell off.\u2018Now that I think about it. I almost got bitten by a vampire just now, right?\u2019He looked at Camibarez, goosebumps forming for some reason. Before he knew it, she was about to cry and her entire face had gone crimson.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dShe bowed her head and shouted,\u201cI\u2019m really sorry! The desire to win was too strong, so I ended up doing this\u2026\u2026! Are you hurt?\u201d\u201cN-Not at all.\u201d\u201cUwaaah! I\u2019m really sorry!\u201d\u201cNo, everything was fair and square. What are you apologizing for? You made really good decisions.\u201dSuddenly, the one who lost, Egir, seemed to appease the winner, Camibarez. Looking at this scene, a small bit of laughter burst out from the audience seat.Seeing Camibarez looking at his wounds with tears in her eyes, Egir felt a sudden flutter in his heart.\u2018\u2026\u2026Woah. Was there a cute girl like her in Kizen?\u2019Camibarez calmed down after some time, and the two stood up, letting the staff mop the floor for the next match.\u2018Sh-Should I try to talk to her a little?\u2019Egir furtively approached Camibarez, wanting to get to know her.\u201cCami! Are you alright?\u201dAt that moment, a male student\u2019s voice was heard from the audience. Camibarez, who had been burying her face in her palms out of embarrassment, turned her head towards the direction of the voice and waved her hand quickly.\u201cYes! Simon! I won~!\u201dShe was jumping and smiling like sunshine. Then, she belatedly turned to Egir, got startled, and bowed her head with an apologetic look.\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t know you were next to me! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dEgir nodded his head softly while telling her it\u2019s fine. At the same time, he wept inwardly.\u2018Huhu\u2026\u2026 It was for a short while, but I liked you.\u2019Meanwhile, the three were also talking about Camibarez in the audience seat.\u201cBwahahaha! Awesome! Cami\u2019s probably the only one in Kizen who can win like that!\u201dSaid Rick with a burst of laughter.Simon added,\u201cThe decision to rush forward while receiving the attacks with her whole body when she was paralyzed was amazing.\u201d\u201cMhm. That\u2019s true! Come to think of it, the paralysis potion was also a setup move for that.\u201d\u201cOur Cami gets her things done when it\u2019s necessary, you know!\u201dJust then, Cami came up to the audience seat. She looked very free and easy.\u201cEveryonnne~!\u201dEveryone stood up and greeted her when they saw her running towards them.\u201cGood job, Cami!\u201dMeilyn brought Cami into a tight hug.\u201cOooh, how small and precious~!\u201d\u201cM-Meilyn! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201dSimon and Rick also smiled and came over to stroke Camibarez\u2019s head and congratulated her.And just like that, all members of Group 7 won the important first match in the Duel Evaluation.All four of them would be starting the Duel Evaluation in the middle squad.* * *Now, a happy weekend awaited Simon tomorrow.Since he had been working without a break in the meantime, Simon was thinking about taking a break this weekend. Leisurely doing some eye shopping in the Necromancer shop in Rochest and such\u2026\u2026\u201cMhm. There\u2019s no time to rest.\u201dMeilyn lay it all out.\u201cYou do know that the midterm exam is the week after next, right?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dThe midterm exam was only about a week away when he realized it.Concerned with the Duel Evaluation alone, he felt like he had been hit in the head. Moreover, he confidently told her that he\u2019d surpass Meilyn\u2019s score in Summoning studies this midterm.\u2018There\u2019s no time for this.\u2019Simon realized that he was pressed by an urgent business. As soon as he returned to the dorm, he headed to the study hall with the textbook on his side.\u2018\u2026\u2026Woah.\u2019They say that everyone is on the same playing field.Even though tomorrow was the weekend and the Duel Evaluation had just ended, the spacious study hall of the dorm was full of students. The surroundings were so quiet you could feel chills like people were studying without even breathing.Simon, who felt a sense of crisis along with them, quickly took the last empty seat left and sat down.\u2018Since I\u2019m somewhat confident in Summoning, let\u2019s try to make up for the subjects that I\u2019m weak at.\u2019He opened his Mechanics of Jet-Black textbook and started studying.And after about 10 minutes\u2026\u2018I-I\u2019m sure I learned this in class\u2026\u2026 Why can\u2019t I understand a single thing?\u2019It was different from the Summoning training he\u2019d been doing the whole time. The limitations of studying by himself were too clear.He needed to take some measures.* * *The next morning.Yawn\u2026Meilyn, dressed in pajamas with a toothbrush in her mouth, was walking down the hallway with a sleepy face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why is my roommate taking an hour to finish a shower?\u201dIt was obvious. She was probably going to Rochest to meet a guy, not caring about midterm exams.At that moment, when Meilyn was heading to the public bath while grumbling repeatedly,\u201cMeilyn!\u201dThe dormitory manager, whom she was close with, ran up to her.Meilyn stopped walking and turned to look at her.\u201cA male student is looking for you at the entrance of the dorm!\u201d\u201cWh-What? Who is it at this hour in the morning?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear his name, but he was a cute looking, handsome boy. He said that he\u2019ll wait in front of the entrance until you come out.\u201dThe dormitory manager winked and passed by a confused Meilyn.\u2018\u2026\u2026I mean, I only have two boys that I know and hang out with, though.\u2019It was too far to go to the public bathroom.Meilyn quickly ran back the way she came and returned to her dorm room. The bathroom was still closed tight. Meilyn kicked the door hard and shouted,\u201cStop it already and get out of there, you bitch!! I need to shit!\u201d\u201cKyaaaah!\u201dAfter driving out her roommate by force, Meilyn quickly finished her cool, effortless makeup. Then she ran out with only the outerwear of the Kizen school uniform on her shoulder.After a while,\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn let out a dumbfounded smile.\u201cSo you\u2019re that cute, handsome boy?\u201dSimon scratched the side of his head.\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Meilyn frowned.\u201cAgh. Shut up. Other than that, what made you come all the way to the girls\u2019 dormitory?\u201dSimon smiled and clapped his hands.\u201cMeilyn, you look nice today. Did you get your hair done?\u201d\u201cHey!!\u201dShe blushed before raising her voice.\u201cStop praising me with words that stink of Rick and just get to the point!\u201dSimon answered right away.\u201cLet\u2019s study together this weekend.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 So you had an ulterior motive after all.\u201dMeilyn covered her forehead and sighed as she folded her arms expressionlessly.\u201cWhy should I do that? I find it easier to study by myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to do it together. We also have different subjects that we excel at, so we can ask each other, and\u2014 Ah! Of course, you\u2019re good at all subjects, but it\u2019ll be easier for you to remember things while teaching others.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dShe pretended to think for a moment, then said,\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201dSimon folded his fingers together.\u201cCamibarez said she would come right away, and Rick went down to Rochest, so he said he\u2019d at least come in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cAlright. I can\u2019t go right away since I have unfinished study, but I\u2019ll pass by in an hour or two.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dParting with Meilyn, Simon went to the empty lecture room, where he got permission from the manager.After gathering four desks together, he opened a textbook.\u2018Alright, I\u2019m done setting up. Let\u2019s do this!\u2019While Simon was stretching his arms and making up his mind, he heard a knock.\u201cSimon! Are you here?\u201d\u201cAh, Cami. Come in.\u201dThe door opened with a click, and Camibarez entered the lecture room in plain clothes.Wearing a bright, pastel dress, she smiled and sat across from Simon.\u201cTo think that we can even study together on the weekend like this! I\u2019m so excited!\u201dSimon blinked.\u201cSo you really like studying, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter softly rolling her eyes, she suddenly turned her gaze toward the textbook Simon left open.\u201cAh! Are you studying Hemomancy?\u201d\u201cYeah. Since you\u2019re here, I\u2019d like to start with Hemomancy. I want to ask some questions. Would that be alright with you?\u201d\u201cYes! Yes! Of course!\u201dCamibarez pulled out her Summoning textbook from her bag and smiled.\u201cThen can I ask you questions too, Simon?\u201d\u201cOf course! I don\u2019t know how much I can help, but at least we can think about it together.\u201dThe two immediately started studying for the exam.It was peaceful.Only the sound of moving quills could be heard in the lecture room, and a cool breeze was blowing outside the window, shaking the curtains.As it felt like the perfect place for a moment, Simon stopped his quill and took a deep breath.\u201cSimon~\u201dThen, Camibarez called to Simon.\u201cI don\u2019t really get this.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dSimon checked the problem she marked with a star.His face broke into a grin.\u201cAh, it\u2019s a problem related to zombies! This problem is solved using the Decay formula.\u201d\u201cThe Decay formula?\u201d\u201cYeah, I found out about it yesterday, so\u2026\u201dSimon started explaining excitedly as he came up against a problem he knew.Camibarez tilted her head and listened to Simon\u2019s explanation.\u201cYou can apply this formula to solve it. However, if you reread the problem, it says the season is a hot and humid summer, right? In summer, the Decay proceeds faster, so considering the acceleration value\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019Camibarez looked at Simon like she had been charmed.The wind blew through the window, and Simon\u2019s hair and the hem of his shirt swayed in the breeze.His forehead was slightly furrowed, as though concentrating. Protruding veins could be seen when he rolled up the shirt while explaining the problem.He also gave off the image of a child smiling brightly, explaining something after being lost for words for a moment when thinking about how to explain it.\u201cHere, you can sum it up and solve it. Did you understand that?\u201dWhen Simon raised his head and asked her that, Camibarez got startled and answered,\u201cYes! Yes! I got it! I have to take into account the Decay formula, plus the acceleration value for the season, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s good that you understood it well.\u201dSimon let out a friendly smile and turned back to the problem he was solving. She put her hand on her chest and let out a small sigh of relief.\u2018\u2026\u2026Aaaaah. Somehow, it\u2019s more difficult to concentrate.\u2019The two went back to studying for the exam again. They answered each other\u2019s questions and found points they could improve in.Camibarez\u2019 know-how was very helpful for Simon, who had never studied for school before enrolling into Kizen.\u201cPlease check this part. Professor Silage repeated it three times.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dIt was then when Simon opened his notebook and took notes of the points Camibarez mentioned.Click!\u201cHello everyone!\u201dWith the sound of the door opening, Meilyn waved and entered the lecture room.\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d\u201cWelcome, Meilyn!\u201dThe two greeted her warmly.\u201cBe grateful. I\u2019m only helping because we\u2019re in the same group. After all, it\u2019ll be difficult for everyone else to run the group if any of you get expelled.\u201dMuttered Meilyn while she sat down and took out her things.Simon was surprised as he saw the textbooks and notebooks she pulled out. He didn\u2019t really pay much attention to it, but it seemed like she was really studying a lot, using 2-3 notebooks for each subject.After laying out the notebooks and tying her hair back, she filled her quill with ink.\u201cBut this place is so nice~\u201dSaid Meilyn when she looked around.It was spacious, there was little noise, and it was breezy. It was the perfect atmosphere for studying.\u201cI think it\u2019s better than the dormitory study hall. It was a good choice, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Whatever.\u201dShe glossed over it in embarrassment and took out a textbook. Simon and Camibarez looked at each other, smiling quietly.\u201cA-Anyway! Ask me anything if you\u2019re having trouble understanding something.\u201dSaid Meilyn as she glanced at Camibarez\u2019 textbook. There was a problem marked with a star.\u201cThis one uses the Decay formula.\u201d\u201cYeah! Simon explained it to me!\u201d\u201cCami, you really don\u2019t know the Decay formula? If you got a mark in the 80s on the last Summoning test, you\u2019d obviously\u2014\u201dIn that instant, Camibarez\u2019 face turned red as though her intentions had been caught out.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know!!\u201d\u201cAh, that startled me.\u201d\u201cTh-The truth is, I knew a little about the Decay Formula, but the answer came out wrong because I didn\u2019t know that you had to apply the seasonal value! S-So\u2026\u2026!\u201dLooking at her mumbled excuses, Meilyn made a face as though asking what was wrong with her.Simon couldn\u2019t hear the conversation, too busy solving the next problem.Knock knock.Just then, a third person could be heard knocking at the lecture room.\u201cYes, come in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut there was no answer.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *The door didn\u2019t open either.\u201cSimon.\u201dMeilyn put her quill down and turned her head.\u201cIs there anyone else coming?\u201d\u201cJust Rick, but he must\u2019ve gone down to Rochest, so I doubt he\u2019s back already. I wonder who that is.\u201dSimon got up and went to the door.However\u2026\u201cMmmf! Mmfmmmfmmf! Mfmmmf!\u201dA strange noise was heard from beyond the door.\u201cWh-Who\u2019s that?\u201dAs Camibarez cowered in fright, Simon raised his palm to signal that it was okay and opened the door.\u201cBwwwut areb bayou dowwin! Bhurry up band ofenn dje doorrr!\u201cRick!\u201dRick was holding something like a large box in his arms. He also had a paper bag in his mouth.\u201cHuzzah.\u201dHe put the box down on the empty desk.\u201cWhat are all these things?\u201d\u201cThings in preparation for the next Duel Evaluation. And\u2026!\u201dRick threw something. Simon, who had returned to his seat, quickly raised his hand to grab it.\u201cSome snacks to eat together!\u201d\u201cKyaah! Thanks Rick!\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, it\u2019s pretty tactful.\u201dRick laid down the snacks he had bought from Rochest on the desk.\u201cHehe. Studying for the exam wouldn\u2019t go well without eating something.\u201d\u201cPeople who say those kinds of things are always the ones who are bad at studying.\u201dWhile saying that, Meilyn was pulling at a wrapper harder than anyone else.\u201cHey! Rick! How do you open this?!\u201d\u201cJust start with something else.\u201d\u201cI want to eat this!\u201dMeilyn was holding onto the grain cookie wrapper she chose and groaned with all her might.Seeing this, Simon reached out his arm and had the wrapper passed to him, then ripped it apart along the dotted line behind.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn got embarrassed and muttered a small \u201cthank you\u201d as she got the wrapper back.\u201cIt\u2019s done! Let\u2019s eat!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201d\u201cThank you for the treat, Rick!\u201dRick said it was a snack, but in fact, it was a composition no less than a meal, starting with desserts and sweets, and going all the way to things like fried chicken.The four of them started eating the snacks while chatting noisily.\u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t you say you were going to Rochest? You were pretty quick.\u201dSaid Simon, tapping Rick\u2019s elbow. Rick threw a piece of fried chicken into his mouth and grinned.\u201cI just left after checking the progress! I also have to study a bit since it\u2019s exam period, you know.\u201d\u201cWhen I went to the Necromancer shop, the owner asked how you are. He asked when you\u2019re dropping out and going to him.\u201d\u201cHahahahahahah!\u201dRick shrugged, laughing at Simon\u2019s joke, then wiped his chin.\u201cHm\u2026 It\u2019s true that I\u2019m No.1 on the recruitment list for the Rochest Merchants Association.\u201d\u201cThen drop out already. Why are you studying for the exam here?\u201dSaid Meilyn as she opened two packs of cookies at once. Rick shook his finger.\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s a business that requires me to be a Kizen student if I want to proceed.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Rick! Speaking of which, what kind of business are you preparing for?\u201dAsked Camibarez.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated because I\u2019m preparing for a lot, but the simplest one would be the delivery service.\u201d\u201cDelivery service?\u201d\u201cYeah. There may be things that you need to go down to Rochest to buy, even on a weekday, right? Not everyone can go down by avoiding the Keepers like Simon or me either. So, I\u2019m planning to get the order of the necessary items, list them, and put them along with the dormitory supplies to bring inside Kizen the next day.\u201dSimon blinked.\u201cDid you talk about that with the dormitory already?\u201d\u201cOf course! I finished talking with the house guardian. I also used my excellent skills to make all the pamphlets for the order items.\u201d\u201cAwesome, Rick!\u201dAt that moment, Rick\u2019s hand slipped through the air as he was about to pick up a castella.\u201cHuh? What? Where did the castella here go?\u201dRick picked up the wrapper and looked inside, but it was empty. He looked at Meilyn with a look of pure astonishment.\u201cWoah, you ate all these by yourself? Are you a pig or something?\u201dMeilyn blushed before getting fired up.\u201cWhat? A pig? Do you wanna die?\u201d\u201cWhat an appetite when you were the one who mentioned things about people who snack being bad at studying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I haven\u2019t eaten anything since last night!\u201d\u201cAhaha! Don\u2019t fight!\u201dIt felt like studying for the exam had been pushed a bit to the side, but Simon was feeling quite happy in this moment where everyone was laughing and talking like this.He also started to regret starting this thing called \u2018school life\u2019 so late, wondering how things could\u2019ve been.Knock knock knock.Then there was a knock on the lecture room door. Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the door.\u201cHey, Simon. There\u2019s no one else to come now, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, no more now, really.\u201dSimon stood up from his seat and went to the door.\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe moment he heard that insincere and frank answer, Simon stopped as if someone had pressed pause when he got to the door.Don\u2019t tell me, this voice of a girl was\u2026\u2026No, but why was this person here?While Simon was putting his brain to work\u2026\u00a0Click!\u00a0The door opened.As the door opened, a little girl with her picturesque silver hair fluttering in the air revealed herself.She raised her hand and gave a happy smile.\u201cHello, Simon! It\u2019s been a while!\u201dThe prediction had become reality.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Simon looked down at her with a blank expression.\u2018\u2026\u2026N-Nefthis?\u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s food! Food!\u201dNefthis ran in quick, short steps and climbed up Simon\u2019s chair while whimpering. Soon, her eyes twinkled and she had to gulp down her saliva.\u201cKyaaaaah! Who is this kid?\u201cShe\u2019s sooooo adorable!\u201dMeilyn and Camibarez screamed and made a fuss, looking at Nefthis.Nefthis tilted her head, glancing to the side with her innocent eyes.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me, do they not know?\u2019Simon stretched out his arms in fright.\u201cH-Hold on, guys!\u201d\u201cDo you want some snacks?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dAs Nefthis nodded quickly, Meilyn stroked Nefhis\u2019 head while looking like she was about to die from the cuteness.Camibarez immediately turned to look at Rick.\u201cCan we feed her, Rick?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeahhh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYaay!\u201dNefthis hurriedly picked up the snacks and began to stuff them in her mouth after permission was granted.Both her cheeks were puffy and plump. She said with a smile on her face,\u201cDewicious!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaah!\u201cDo you wanna eat this too?\u201dMeilyn tore the wrapper and held out a cookie. Nefthis opened her mouth wide and took a large bite.\u201cNom nom!\u201d\u201cShe ate iiiit!\u201d\u201cMe too! I wanna do it too!\u201d\u2026\u2026The situation was starting to hit rock bottom.\u201cHold on, guys! This person is\u2014!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so cute~ What\u2019s your name?\u201dWhile frantically putting food in her mouth, she smiled broadly at Camibarez\u2019 gentle question.\u201cYeah! My name is Nefthis!\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d\u201cSo cute!\u201d\u2026\u2026They don\u2019t believe her at all!!Most of the continent\u2019s people who weren\u2019t Kizen officials didn\u2019t know that the so-called 300-year-old Nefthis was actually a small child.That was because she hadn\u2019t appeared in any official meetings for decades, and only moved behind the name of Kizen. Also, she sometimes took on the form of something other than a girl when she had to show up.Most of all, the weight and fear of the name Nefthis had given rise to many imaginative speculations.The people of the continent imagined Nefthis as a terrible witch that transcended humanity, something between human and monster.Of course, rumors that Nefthis looked like a little girl were also known, but Meilyn and Camibarez had no such suspicion right now.They just weren\u2019t capable of thinking about the fact that Nefthis could appear here right now.\u2018Wh-What should I do?\u2019Simon felt like he was looking at a ticking time bomb getting close to zero.On the other hand, Rick, who excelled at information, was moving to another place while ignoring them as if he had already finished grasping the situation.\u2018Rick! Do something!\u2019Simon tried to signal to Rick with his hands, but Rick couldn\u2019t see Simon. He was sitting away from them, face hardened\u201c\u2026\u2026Rick?\u201dBelatedly, Camibarez turned and looked at Rick. He was kneeling on the chair with a stiff face.\u201cWhy did you just start kneeling?\u201d\u201cWh-What are you talking about?! I\u2019ve been sitting like this for my entire life!\u201dSaid Rick, sweating profusely.Even if he wanted to tell them, Nefthis kept his mouth shut by occasionally giving Rick a strange gaze.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201dMeilyn showed a reaction befitting a girl her age for the first time in a while.As she stroked her hair, Nefthis smiled pleasantly.\u201cYeah! It\u2019s dewdicious!\u201d\u201cAwwwww, my heart hurts\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing such a pretty girl!\u201dAfter eating snacks to her heart\u2019s content and tapping her small stomach, Nefthis jumped out of her chair. Then, she ran to Simon\u2019s side, took his hand, and said,\u201cSimon! Can I see you for a moment?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, yes.\u201dThe two left the lecture room.Simon quickly said,\u201cNefthis, I\u2019ll apologize on their behalf. They couldn\u2019t recognize you, so\u2014\u201d\u201cHehe, don\u2019t mind it! It happens all the time anyway! The snacks were delicious too.\u201dShe said while smiling. Then, she stopped walking and stared into Simon\u2019s eyes. Simon also stopped his steps and waited for her.\u201cHmm.\u201dShe gave a wry smile.\u201cSo you finally obtained your Legion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dSimon felt his heart sink. She returned to her childish smile again and took Simon\u2019s hand.\u201cThis isn\u2019t really the place to talk about it, so shall we move someplace else?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNefthis jumped up while holding Simon\u2019s hand.With the sensation of his legs suddenly floating, Simon felt as though he had gone beyond all dimensions of space.When he opened his eyes, the surroundings had changed into another place.\u2018Where in the world is this place?\u2019It was someone\u2019s room.There was a combination of cream and pink wallpapers, the curtains were frilled, and displayed on the shelves were decorative items and cute stuffed animals. The room had a really pleasant smell.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2019Simon turned his head to look at the girl who was outwardly the most suited to this room.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had this kind of taste, Nefthis\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t my room, though.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt that moment, there was the sound of a blanket being pulled behind him.Simon looked back in shock.He could see a pretty girl with red eyes, a blank face, and dark hair down to her back that still had some moisture remaining.\u201cL-Lorain!\u201dSimon\u2019s face flushed red.Lorain was wearing comfortable shorts she wore at home, and only wore undergarments to cover her top.She covered her body with her arms with an expressionless face and looked at Nefthis.\u201cMother.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re teleporting a guy into my room, you\u2019re just trying to mess with me, right?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201dNefthis put her hands on her hips and proudly said,\u201cI\u2019m here because I have something to tell you guys at the same time!\u201d\u201cHaaaah.\u201dLetting out a deep sigh, her red eyes flashed fiercely.\u201cYou\u2019re always like this, Mother.\u201d\u201cHmph. Same goes for you!\u201dNefthis jumped around.\u201cYou overslept again even though it\u2019s an exam period, didn\u2019t you? Look at Simon. He\u2019s even doing group study, gathering his group members by himself!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of myself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that I keep getting messages from Professors these days?\u201d\u201cEven if I don\u2019t know those little formulas, it has nothing to do with my skills!\u201dA bloody atmosphere rose up between them.Judging from the content, it was a typical fight between a mother and a rebellious daughter, but if you looked at it from a step back, it could be seen as nothing but a fight between sisters.\u2018\u2026\u2026I wanna go back to my dorm.\u2019Simon was attached to the wall, face pale after suddenly being caught up in the world\u2019s scariest mother and daughter fight.\u201cPlease just hurry up and finish it, mother. And Simon?\u201d\u201cAh, yes?\u201d\u201cCould you quit glancing at me?\u201dSimon shed tears inwardly.\u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m looking at you because I want to.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Lorain got up from the bed and pulled out some clothes from the hanger, wrapping them around her body. Simon could finally look at her properly now.\u201cWell, Simon! First of all, about the story you reported.\u201dSaid Nefthis after planting her butt on a nearby chair.\u201cThe story I reported?\u201d\u201cYeah! About the spy that infiltrated the Kizen.\u201dSo she heard it from Lorain.Simon waited for her next words nervously.\u201cI\u2019ve assigned trustworthy servants for investigations for now. We\u2019re also getting clues little by little.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cBut the reason why I came to you is to warn you.\u201dNefthis continued in a serious voice.\u201cI think that traitor knows your identity.\u201dSimon felt his heart sinking. Nefthis slowly continued,\u201cDo you remember that Cyclops Evaluation last time? The reason why the Cyclops that your group faced at that time was particularly strong wasn\u2019t because of the side effects of drugs or curses during the capture, but because someone deliberately took some measures.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dNefthis smiled.\u201cYou\u2019d of course know what their intentions were even if I didn\u2019t say it, right?\u201d\u2026\u2026Disguising it as an accidental death.Simon gulped.\u201cSimon.\u201dThis time, Lorain opened her mouth.\u201cSince you said you met them in the Forbidden Forest, the spy is far more likely to be at the school than at the Kizen Headquarters. If you stay here, your life may continue to be at risk.\u201d\u201cYup. Something like that.\u201dNefthis folded her arms while smiling with her eyes.\u201cLorain was very worried about you, you know!\u201d\u201cMother!!\u201d\u201cAnyway, do you really not want to accept Kizen\u2019s protection measures?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon firmly shut his mouth.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about being expelled from Kizen, I can process it as repetition like your roommate, Kajann. Just go back to your hometown until the case is resolved and start over next year.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m really grateful for your concern, but I won\u2019t change my mind.\u201dSimon slowly raised his head up.\u201cI think my current life is worth protecting and taking this risk. Please let me remain in the school. I\u2019m also looking for clues on my own, so it should be a help.\u201dLorain bit her lip, making a complicated face, and Nefthis nodded her head with a light heart.\u201cActually, I knew you\u2019d obviously say that! You\u2019re Richard\u2019s son, after all.\u201dShe took out a silver necklace from her subspace. As Simon looked at it, wondering what it was, she motioned for him to lower his body.Simon quickly knelt down on one knee. Nefthis got on her tiptoes and hung the necklace directly on Simon\u2019s neck.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cAn artifact. There are a lot of troubles happening on the continent recently, so I can\u2019t just focus on you, you see. So I\u2019ll give you this. The power contained in this necklace will protect you.\u201dSimon gulped as he saw the dazzling light coming off the necklace.It wasn\u2019t hard to guess that it was more expensive than anything he owned.\u201cIf this artifact warns you of danger, you must stop everything you\u2019re doing and leave the place right away. You know what this means, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll mark your words.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dNefthis turned to look at Lorain.\u201cYou take care of Simon too, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I know, Mother.\u201dShe answered her primly. Then, Nefthis jumped up onto the bed.\u201cWaaaake up! Hurry on and waaaake uuuup!\u201d\u201cTh-That hurts!\u201d\u201cSimon.\u201dNefthis pulled Lorain\u2019s arm and looked back at Simon.\u201cI\u2019ll send you back to where you were studying. Bring this lazy bastard with you!\u201d\u201cMother!\u201dLorain shouted with a bewildered expression,\u201cWhy am I going there?\u201d\u201cHmph! You\u2019re never gonna step outside the house if I don\u2019t do this!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s study! It\u2019s going to be awkward if I join, and I\u2019ll be a nuisance to Simon\u2019s friends!\u201dLorain shouted and pushed Nefthis\u2019 arm away with force, flopping her down on the bed.Sob.Tears suddenly began to form in her eyes.\u201cHic. Huuu! Uwaaaah! My daughter keeps on troubling me all the time! Idiot Idiot! Lorain is such an idiiiooot!\u201dNefthis flailing her arms and legs about resembled the typical image of a child throwing a tantrum.Simon was just reading their countenance, not knowing what to do, and Lorain let out a deep sigh before pressing her forehead as though feeling a little guilty.\u201cHaaah\u2026\u2026 Fine. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cMhm mhm! Then I\u2019m counting on you with Lorain, Simon!\u201dNefthis, who stopped crying immediately, came down from the bed. Simon was a little perplexed by her complete change in attitude, but Lorain grunted and opened the closet as though used to it.\u201cJust come out when you guys are ready!\u201dNefthis left the room while humming. Lorain took a uniform out of her closet.\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll stay silent for an hour or so and take my leave.\u201d\u201cNah, nah. We\u2019re happy to have more study members.\u201dLorain suddenly stopped moving and stared at Simon\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Wh-What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAre you planning on watching me change?\u201dSimon, whose face turned red at those words, hurriedly ran out.* * *After a while, Lorain joined Group 7\u2019s study session.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn, Camibarez, and Rick recognized the big name, Lorain, and their faces turned pale.There was an awkward atmosphere running in the lecture room as the five were seated together. Only the eyes were busy moving, glancing at her.Meilyn was staring at Simon\u2019s face as if asking for an explanation, and Rick was wishing that he had around ten hearts.To think that he just saw Nefthis, and now Lorain!\u201cThis is Lorain from Class L.\u201dSimon on the other hand introduced Lorain with a smile as if it was nothing.\u201cShe wants to study together, at least for today. Would that be alright?\u201dThe three quickly nodded their heads. Even if it wasn\u2019t okay, it had to be okay.After looking around with an expressionless face, Lorain began to say something in a calm voice.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70\u201cHello. Treat me like I don\u2019t exist and just act as usual.\u201dAfter a simple self-introduction, Lorain sat down and opened the textbook. Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez glanced at her occasionally, even while looking at their notes.\u2018How the hell do we treat you like someone who doesn\u2019t exist?!\u2019She was none other than the daughter of Nefthis. It was never a comfortable atmosphere.The lecture room felt very stuffy.\u2018\u2026\u2026By the way.\u2019Meilyn rolled her eyes.\u2018How does Simon know Lorain?\u2019Meilyn was skeptical, but she understood after a bit of thought.Simon was the Special Admission No.1, having been recommended by Nefthis. Even if he was acquainted with her daughter, there was nothing strange about it.\u2018So pretty\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Camibarez was in pure admiration.Black hair as though painted with the night sky combined with ruby-colored eyes. And even that unique, hard-to-approach atmosphere.Among Kizen\u2019s students, Lorain had a unique feeling.And Rick, who valued connections more than anyone else, wanted to talk with Lorain. However, he was holding back because he thought there was a higher chance that he\u2019d be marked as someone strange through a slip of the tongue than getting close to her.\u2018Let\u2019s just study.\u2019Scratch scratch.Only the sound of quills could be heard in the quiet lecture room. The once boisterous atmosphere had gone silent, but in fact, this atmosphere was better for studying.Everyone worked hard to study so that they wouldn\u2019t mind Lorain.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, as if she was stuck at some part, Lorain bit her lip and frowned.Simon, who caught that, quietly asked her,\u201cCan\u2019t solve it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cNumber 7 over here.\u201dSimon said in a loud voice as if to let others hear it,\u201cOh, is that so? Meilyn is really good at problems with Curses, though.\u201dMeilyn, who had her head lowered and concentrated on her studies, raised her head, blushing.She was moving to mouth, \u2018Hey! Shut up!\u2019, but the moment Lorain raised her head, she quickly closed her mouth.Simon giggled and said,\u201cMeilyn, could you please explain this to her?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh, sure.\u201dIn the end, Meilyn awkwardly approached Lorain before standing next to her and starting to explain Problem 7.It was only natural that Lorain couldn\u2019t solve it. She didn\u2019t know the formula.After listening to Meilyn\u2019s explanation, Lorain nodded her head.\u201cThen, if you substitute into that formula, it would be like this.\u201dShe\u2019d only heard the formula, but Lorain was smoothly writing down the solution in her notebook.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right! You\u2019re really good at this.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t empty words. Meilyn really did mean it.Was this what they meant by, if you\u2019ve seen one you\u2019ve seen them all? She had a surprising ability to understand.\u201cBut why did you reduce all the fractions here on solving?\u201d\u201cBecause this is the only way that I know. Is it wrong?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 No! It\u2019s not like that. This kind of approach is also quite impressive. Hold on\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Meilyn, who was teaching, was more excited. Simon thought while looking at her,\u2018Is she like a laid-back genius\u2026 or something like that?\u2019Lorain\u2019s skills were undisputed.People said she was weak at written tests, but in fact, it felt like she had enough ability, but was not motivated or couldn\u2019t find any inspiration. Of course, this was just Simon\u2019s speculation.After Meilyn started off, Rick and Camibarez also exchanged words with her. Everyone thought she was extremely serious and scary, but Lorain treated them more warmly than they thought.Nom.Hungry, she took a bite of the snack that Rick brought. She nodded her head as though it suited her palate.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cGrain cookies from Rochest.\u201dQuickly replied Rick. Lorain let out a small admiration.\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was such a thing.\u201d\u201cWant me to tell you the location?\u201dThe mood started to loosen up, and Simon looked at them with a feeling of accomplishment and relief.Lorain also said that she\u2019d leave after an hour or two, but she stayed longer when her studies went better than expected, and the other members of the group also felt less pressure and welcomed Lorain.Time passed, and it was getting dark. The manager came and told them that they had to empty the lecture room now.\u201cBye guys!\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s study session was great!\u201dEveryone said their goodbyes. They wanted to play more in the evening as a break if they could do as they pleased, but it was exam period, so they decided to study individually.Simon decided to walk Lorain to the exit of Kizen.\u201c\u2026\u2026So it\u2019s already been a month.\u201dMuttered Lorain before looking at Simon.\u201cIs school life fun?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cIs this life precious enough to take such a risk?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSimon answered without hesitation.She nodded slowly, draped her robe on, and then put on a hood. As soon as she opened her arms, a subspace was revealed in the air and a wonderful skeleton horse appeared from within.\u201cThank you for walking me here. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dShe held the tall skeleton horse\u2019s torso with her palms and climbed up in one leap.As Simon lightly stroked the skeleton horse\u2019s head, the skeleton horse made a purring sound and rubbed Simon\u2019s palm with its head.\u201cSimon.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cDoubt everything. Trust no one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAfter leaving those words, she pulled the reins of the Skeleton horse and left.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Time flew during the exam period.When Simon woke up and went to school, he could find himself lying in bed before he knew it, exhausted.Due to next week\u2019s midterm exam issue and the Duel Evaluation being slightly dealt with, all the students started preparing for the exams. The professors also seemed to like the student\u2019s awakening of concentration, as the students had been flustered for a while due to the duels.Simon also adopted Meilyn\u2019s study method, increasing the number of notes and reviewing for 20 minutes immediately after class. He memorized important questions and solved sample problems in his spare time.\u2018\u2026\u2026At this point, it\u2019s a battle of stamina.\u2019He learned a lot in preparation for the last Duel Evaluation. He did cut down on sleep, but he avoided crazy things such as staying up all night as much as possible. He focused on every minute and second of the moments where his eyes were open.Now, it had become a daily routine to visit the cafe, library, or dormitory study hall after class.\u201cGaaaah! Faster!\u201dWhile studying at the campus cafe, Rick suddenly pretended to be choked with emotion.\u201cPlease, let this week pass already! Ugh! Can you really call this the life of a person?\u201dSimon, who was studying in the seat next to him, chuckled.\u201cYou there.\u201dIt was then. A girl flipping through magazines in the back window seat glared at Rick.\u201cDo you all wanna die? Be quiet.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRick quickly bowed his head. The female student turned her head irritatedly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Come on, she doesn\u2019t have to go that far, right?\u201dAs Simon murmured, Rick quickly put the finger on his lips and shushed Simon.\u201cThat person is a second-year student.\u201dIf there was one thing that changed starting this week, it was that the second- and third-years had finally come back to Kizen.Since the dormitories and campuses where the classes were held were divided by year level, it was rare to meet them during class. However, after class, they could occasionally meet at the campus cafe or library.It was not so clear, but second-year students had a small red mark on the collar of the Kizen school uniform, and third-year students had a gray mark.In particular, the third-years were so busy with missions and practical exercises you couldn\u2019t really encounter them. The student council and clan management were also organized mainly by the second-years.\u201cYou\u2019d better watch out for the higher years.\u201dRick continued while lowering his voice,\u201cThe difference in power and authority that first-years and second-years have are as far apart as the earth from the skies. There\u2019s nothing good about being marked by them pointlessly.\u201dEven Simon, who was new to school, had that much common sense. The two resumed studying for the exam.The next day, and the day after that too.Whether he was sleeping or lying on his desk, Simon\u2019s mind seemed to be spinning with the formulas and knowledge he had learned in class. Some students had nosebleeds in the middle of the class, and others banged their heads on their desks during class due to lack of sleep.But no one gave up.As long as you were part of the group called \u2018Kizen\u2019, you couldn\u2019t escape from the tight tension that strangles your neck. If you couldn\u2019t overcome this much pressure, it was wise to leave the school.A few days later, in Jane\u2019s Beginner Dark Magic class.\u201cThe duration of the performance evaluation is 60 minutes.\u201dAlthough it was a performance evaluation before the exam period, there were no complaints from the students. Needless to say, this evaluation had a strong tendency to prepare the students for the midterm exams.It was a class in which the members of the group sat around each other and worked through a giant test paper that was over 2 meters long. Questions from all 8 subjects, excluding Beginner Dark Magic, were included in this test paper.\u2018It\u2019s certainly advantageous if all four members of the team have different majors.\u2019Simon glanced around.Students who had overlapping majors were still busy fighting over the things that they\u2019d be doing.\u201cFocus!\u201dGroup leader Meilyn stretched out her fingers and elaborately gave instructions.\u201cI\u2019ll do Curses, Cami\u2019s on Hemomancy, Rick\u2019s on Mechanics, and Simon\u2019s on Summoning. If there\u2019s a problem that you don\u2019t understand while solving, mark it with a star and move on quickly. Questions that are confusing or you think need a re-check mark with a triangle. I\u2019ll check them out in numerical order. And if you\u2019re done solving your own majors, Cami will cover Poisonous Alchemy, Simon will cover Combat Magic, and Rick will cover Defense Against the Holy Arts. You got it?\u201dIn the written test, Meilyn\u2019s strength was more than half of the rest of them combined, so everyone quickly nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of Summoning problems. I can trust you with this, right Simon?\u201dSimon grinned at Meilyn\u2019s words.\u201cOf course.\u201dJane looked at her wristwatch and opened her mouth.\u201cWell then. We\u2019ll begin the exam.\u201dSlide!The sound of 16 groups taking off the covers of their test papers was heard.Simon quickly looked for the Summoning problems.It was Summoning starting from question 41.41. Choose an undead that breeds through reproduction. (2 points)ZombieSkeletonSpecterGhoulLich\u2018No.4, Ghoul. A special case of undead which sexually reproduces. The babies grow into adults in one month, and there\u2019s no maternal love toward the parents.\u2019Simon quickly checked No.4 and proceeded with the next question.42. When trying to modify from a normal zombie to a mad zombie, which of the following is incorrect as a detailed formula that can be added to the magic circle?ConstructionRageDespairMadnessConvulsion\u2018It\u2019s No.5 for sure. There\u2019s no reason to use a duplicate formula. The regular zombie formula already has Convulsion!\u2019The corners of Simon\u2019s lips rose.He knew all of them, and he could solve them well! He was so happy that he wanted to scream.\u2018So studying was this much fun?\u2019It was still vivid in his memory. The utter helplessness he felt in Jane\u2019s first test.But now it was different.Simon started solving the problems frantically.Meilyn, who was solving a curse formula problem, smiled, looking at him.\u2018\u2026\u2026Hmph. Looks like he did work hard.\u2019During the time of group selection, Simon declared that he\u2019d quit Kizen if he couldn\u2019t exceed Meilyn\u2019s Summoning score.Of course, the students around them were listening, but his words weren\u2019t compulsory and he could brush it off if Meilyn, the party involved, forgave him.\u2018Needless to say, I\u2019m not just gonna forgive you.\u2019Now Meilyn didn\u2019t want Simon to leave Kizen. However, she did owe him a debt from the Cyclops performance evaluation. She was planning to overcome Simon in Summoning this time and pay off that debt.Obviously, she didn\u2019t tell Simon about that. She wanted Simon to study with tension.\u201cHey, Meilyn! Help me with Question 25, Jet-Black Mechanics!\u201dSuddenly shouted Rick, interfering.Meilyn, who had been looking at Simon with a serious face, quickly turned to look at Rick with an annoyed expression.\u201cI told you to just mark it with a star and move on if you don\u2019t get it, you goddamned wuss!\u201d\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t! If I can\u2019t get this uncomfortable feeling off, it\u2019ll affect me solving the other proble\u2014!\u201d\u201cJust give up!!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 7160 minutes had passed so fast.When Simon solved all 20 Summoning questions and was making every effort on Combat Magic problems with Camibarez, the assistant teacher shouted that there were 5 minutes left in the test.\u201cJust guess the remaining questions! Write down No.5!\u201dShouted Meilyn while finishing a short-response question. Simon also filled in No.5 for the remaining questions and then returned to the original question where he then ran out the clock.\u201cThe exam is over.\u201dSaid Jane.\u201cEveryone, put down your quills!\u201d\u201cHands on your head!\u201dThe assistant teachers went around and retrieved the test papers and answer sheets. The students\u2019 gazes, filled with deep regrets, were headed toward the test papers.\u201cGood job, everyone.\u201dThe assistant teachers then handed out new test papers and answer sheets with explanations.\u201cWe\u2019ll announce the performance evaluation results after the midterm exams. For the rest of the period, we\u2019ll have time to score your answers and identify wrong answers.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSimon decided to start by checking the group\u2019s Summoning score. He firmly grabbed the quill with a pounding heart.\u2018Please, go up\u2026!\u2019He started scoring. Unlike the regular midterm exam, there were only 20 questions, but it was clear that his scores had improved, many problems being correct. Simon started summing up the scores of the correct problems with excitement.And the result was\u2026\u201cIt went up! 84!\u201dIt increased by 8 points from the previous score, 76. Obviously it didn\u2019t seem like a big improvement compared to the amount of study he had done, but the amount of study required to go up from the 70s to the 80s or even from the 30s to the 40s was at a whole different level. An increase of 8 points was a pretty dramatic improvement, no matter what they say.\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh, mm. Pretty good.\u201d\u2018Studying is fun when you get to see your improvements right away like this.\u2019He couldn\u2019t make a proper comparison because the problems were different, but Meilyn\u2019s score on the previous test was 85. This was enough to show Simon some hope in the midterm exam.\u201cHey! Who solved these ones on Defense Against the Holy Arts!\u201dMeilyn, who was checking, burst into anger. Rick raised his head guiltily.\u201cI-I did.\u201d\u201cYou got three questions wrong here in a row! I mean, how can you even get this wrong?\u201dMeilyn poured out her fiery rage, and Rick lowered his head with a trifled face. At that moment, Camibarez, who was checking the paper, exclaimed with a \u201cWhah!\u201d\u201c89 on Hemomancy! The score went up!\u201d\u201cOh, for real? I love you Camiii!\u201dMeilyn hugged her and rejoiced.You could see Rick, who had gotten scolded next to her, stealthily racing his thumb up. Camibarez laughed and raised her thumb too.And just like that, the checking was over.\u201cI expect us to be in the upper ranks overall.\u201dMeilyn folded her arms.\u201cThere were points that left a lot to be desired, but we\u2019d be at an advantage seeing as all of us have a different major. I don\u2019t think our ranks will drop.\u201dEveryone nodded.\u201cAnd as expected from Professor Jane, the questions were nice. I think our overall grades will be alright if we thoroughly study what we got wrong here. Don\u2019t show these questions to the other classes even if it kills you. And I also asked the class president to take control of the questionnaire.\u201dHer happiness made its way up into her eyes before her gaze shifted.\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you just in case~ I don\u2019t think any of the members in my group will ever sell this questionnaire for money.\u201dRick looked guilty, but quickly smiled and said,\u201cO-Of course! I can bear this much damage for Class A\u2026 Ah!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Rick?\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, there\u2019s another Duel Evaluation tomorrow.\u201dAhh\u2026Camibarez, looking jolly, suddenly turned glum and buried her face into the palms of her hands. Simon, on the other hand, was smiling.\u201cYou gotta do one at least once a week. We\u2019ll be in the upper squad if we win tomorrow, right?\u201d\u201cYeap.\u201d\u201cWhew~ Simon, are you confident?\u201dSimon crossed his arms in response to Meilyn\u2019s question.\u201cIt\u2019s just like usual.\u201d\u201cBe very careful about tomorrow\u2019s Duel Eval, Simon.\u201dSaid Rick in a serious tone.\u201cBecause rumors have spread already that you can use Golems, the opponent will probably rush an offensive attack from the beginning.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cNow, now.\u201dMeilyn clapped her hands.\u201cThe Duel Evaluation is also very important, so I\u2019ll focus only on it tonight. Let\u2019s finish ours quickly and study for the midterm exam.\u201d\u201cYes, Meilyn!\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d* * *The next day, the day of the Duel Evaluation.The 3rd indoor stadium.Contrary to last week\u2019s heat, the audience seat was a bit silent. Next week was also the midterm exam, so for the sake of managing the students\u2019 stress during this exam period, scouts from outside were banned from entering the school.Rick, Meilyn, and Camibarez also had Duel Evaluations, all in different stadiums.An empty atmosphere like this felt more comfortable. Simon took a note packed with things to memorize and began to study the formulas. He couldn\u2019t waste even a short bit of free time like this.[Simon Polentia from Class A. Jessica Cananore from Class C. Please proceed to the stadium.]Simon, who had been waiting in advance, got up immediately and went to the stadium. An opponent was walking in from the other side as well. Jessica was a female student with freckles and green hair.The servants ran out and put protective suits on them. Then, the referee made a gesture.\u201cPlease shake hands.\u201dJessica approached near to shake hands. However\u2026Murmur murmur.Simon didn\u2019t take his eyes off the notes until the moment she approached. Then, as they got closer, he put down the notebook and held out his hand with a smile.\u2018Studying for the midterm in the midst of this? What a weirdo.\u2019Jessica forced a smile and shook hands with Simon.The two now slowly went a distance apart. When Jessica glanced back, Simon had buried his face in the notebook again.\u2018So you\u2019re ignoring a person in this way because you\u2019re a Special Admission No.1?\u2019Jessica felt like she was being provoked a little. After a while, the two of them stood facing each other.\u201cNow then. We\u2019ll begin the Duel Evaluation between Simon Polentia and Jessica Cananore.\u201dThe referee\u2019s arm dropped.\u201cBegin the match!\u201dSimon took out three skeletons while covering his face with a notebook, making Jessica\u2019s face stiffen up.\u2018There\u2019s a limit to belittling a person!\u2019She immediately prepared dark magic in the palm of her hand. Simon didn\u2019t show any sudden movements other than advancing the formation, so she successfully completed the spell.\u201cPoison Fog!\u201dThe green sphere created by Jessica began to spew out Poison Fog in all directions.In the blink of an eye, the entire stadium was filled with green smoke. The smoke was only thick in the central area Simon was in, and it didn\u2019t reach the audience seat thanks to the magic barrier.\u201cOh.\u201dSimon finally took his eyes off his notes and looked around.\u201cA Poisonous Alchemy aspirant.\u201dThere was no information about the opponent this time. In order to not put too much pressure on Rick during the midterm, Simon refused him looking for the information in advance.The protective suit covering Simon\u2019s body repeatedly turned red and blue. It meant that he was continuously taking damage.[Simon Polentia: 97%][Jessica Casanore: 100%]\u2018Hmm\u2026 So this is how she fights.\u2019Laying a poison fog and gnawing at the opponent\u2019s stamina, the Venomancer focusing on defending and countering.Is that her plan? Simon also placed the notebook in his hand into his subspace.Seeing this, Jessica made a satisfied smile.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *\u2018That\u2019s right. You should\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not time for you to study for the midte\u2014\u2019But as soon as he put the notebook in, a new notebook popped out.\u2018This is lucky!\u2019This time, it was a notebook for Poisonous alchemy.\u2018Poison Fog. A classic problem in Poisonous alchemy. A wide-range spell that can result in various effects to the opponent through the combination of poisons. Vulnerable to wind-based jet-black elemental magic, and the runes and formulas used are\u2026\u2026\u2019As Simon studied for the exam, the first exam he had studied for in his life, he realized one important fact.There were countless things to memorize in Kizen, but you couldn\u2019t memorize all of them by locking yourself in the study hall all day and putting them in your head.So, what Simon discovered was the association method. A method of imagining a character in mind by connecting it to a certain event or situation.The most important point was that the content to be memorized shouldn\u2019t be taken as the language itself! It was really easy to recall if he translated it into something like a living situation and understood it.Therefore, studying Poisonous Alchemy in the current situation was something that Simon couldn\u2019t afford to miss.If he revised Poisonous Alchemy here, just recalling the battle with Jessica would remind him of everything.As Simon began to memorize the words with half of his consciousness distracted, Jessica, the opponent, was dumbfounded.Now, rather than feeling provoked, she was angry.\u2018Ugh, so cheeky! I just wanna run up to him and beat the shit out of\u2014! N-No! Don\u2019t be swayed!\u2019This was Kizen. Putting your opponent off on their guard and provoking them was definitely a part of psychological warfare.This should undoubtedly be an act to shake up my composure.And isn\u2019t it a good thing if the opponent looks down on me and gets careless? Don\u2019t fall for provocations. I just have to put him in his place with my skills.\u2018Anyway, his barrier gauge keeps on going down. If I just hold like this, then\u2014!\u2019Ssshhhk!Suddenly, an arrow flew in front of her face. Jessica moved her head, narrowly avoiding it.\u2018\u2026\u2026Th-That startled me.\u2019Cold sweat dripped down her back. Before she knew it, three skeletons holding bows were standing behind Simon\u2019s back. Her eyes widened dramatically.\u2018S-Skeleton archers! He can already use them?\u2019Looks like the news that he\u2019s a Summoning aspirant who can use golems wasn\u2019t just a baseless rumor.Then, Simon, who was burying his face in his notes, stretched out his arm.The archers went blank as the skeletons in the front rushed at Jessica once more.\u2018Calm down\u2026\u2026!\u2019She held a magic circle in her right hand and pulled out a poison potion with her left. As soon as she put the potion on top of the magic circle, the bottle shattered, and the poison in it gathered up.She grabbed it with both her hands and swung it with all her might.\u2018Poison Whip!\u2019A whip made of both jet-black and poison spread out and shattered three skeletons at once. Then, Simon raised his index finger.\u2018Restore\u2019However, the shattered bones only flinched, and there was no reaction.Simon put down his notebook a little and looked ahead. Every part of the skeletons\u2019 bodies were dyed purple.\u201cKabara\u2019s Poison drastically reduces the jet-black sensitivity.\u201dJessica grinned.\u201cEspecially when it comes into contact with a skeleton. It neutralizes the remaining jet-black in the bones, making it impossible to restore for a short period of time. You didn\u2019t know this, didn\u2019t you?\u201dIt was a move that Jessica had been preparing to deal with Summoning aspirants. Seeing that cheeky Special Admission No.1 with that stunned face, she felt refreshed and snobbish.\u201cOh, I see.\u201dSimon took out a quill from the subspace with pure admiration.\u201cKabara\u2019s Poison\u2026\u2026 Reduces jet-black sensitivity\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, he started taking notes. Seeing this, Jessica\u2019s forehead wrinkled.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not\u2026 your\u2026\u201dThree jet-black arrow magic circles began to form in front of her at a tremendous speed.\u201cMidterm exam teacher!\u201dThe moment she was about to command the magic circles to eject\u2026Phew! Whoosh! Whiish!The skeleton archer arrows passed through her magic circles. Her eyes widened sharply. The magic circles started to crumble and collapse as though broken.\u201cThe important points of the jet-black arrow.\u201dMuttered Simon.\u201cQuick casting. Easy multicasting. Excellent penetrating power. The core rune language is projection. When writing the ejection formula, beware of confusing it with the elasticity formula, and\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s cold gaze turned towards the magic circle.\u201cBe careful of damage to the uniting formula on the left side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You!\u201dSimon took out new skeletons from the subspace and made them run. This time, all three were armed with spears and shields.Jessica bit her lip and pulled out a potion again to prepare for Poison Whip.\u201cThe important points of Poison Whip.\u201dThe three skeletons threw the spears held in their hands.\u201cIt has a fixed magic circle that collapses when the coordinates of the magic circle are shifted.\u201dJessica threw herself away in fright. The spear\u2019s tip brushed against her body, and another one hit her thigh. Her barrier gauge was deducted, and the magic circle she was preparing was also destroyed.\u201cKugh!\u201dJessica, who had been staggered, was trying to re-ready herself, but a spear from out of the blue flew into her back.\u201cKyagh!\u201d[Simon Polentia: 85%][Jessica Cananore: 52%]She went down to a knee and looked back quickly. Before she knew it, a skeleton\u2019s arms and shoulders had formed on the floor.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026! Did he restore the parts that didn\u2019t get hit by the Poison Whip so it could pick up a spear that fell on the floor and throw it?\u2019The offense had only just begun.Simon\u2019s command was so dazzling that anyone would be left wide-eyed.\u201cWhen deploying a jet-black arrow targeting an opponent running at 6%\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf one third of the arm and torso are judged to be impossible to restore, what\u2019ll happen if you choose all the correct countermeasures for the caster?\u201d\u201cIf you change the jet-black composition of the skeletons\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon murmured formulas and composed problems, predicting and figuring out all of Jessica\u2019s movements and attacks.Simon himself was also surprised.Study and real fight were never separate things. As the theory was applied to practice, it helped him to make rational decisions.The effort during this exam period made Simon\u2019s movement more sophisticated.[Simon Polentia: 76%][Jessica Cananore: 37%]\u2018At this rate\u2026\u2026!\u2019Jessica clenched her teeth. She\u2019d be knocked out before Poison Fog could knock Simon down.All of the dark magic she was using was fully seen through by Simon, and now she had to make a decision.\u2018I heard that you\u2019re strong at combat magic, but\u2026\u2026!\u2019She ran to Simon, fists clasped with jet-black.\u2018This is the only way I have left!\u2019Arrows from the skeleton archers flew from behind Simon, who was still covering his face with the notebook. She took the arrows with her body and rushed in.\u201cHryaaaaaaaaah!\u201dGathering all her strength, her fist rushed toward the notebook-covered Simon.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, she lost Simon. She thought he had disappeared, and her fist flung through the air in vain.Simon\u2019s body moved like lightning and went down close to the ground before rotating as if sweeping around him. Soon, his leg rose like a pole and kicked up into her stomach.Poooooooow!With great force, her body flew straight into the air. Simon stood up, straightening his stance, and raised his arm over his head.Rattle. Ratttllle.The skeleton bones scattered on the ground floated as though alive.With Simon clenching his fist as a signal\u2026<Simon Polentia Original \u2013 Bone Nail>Pssssshhhhhk!It flew toward her from all directions at a frightening speed.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019She couldn\u2019t dodge them in the air.Jessica closed her eyes in resignation as she looked at the bones flying toward her.Thuthuthuthuthuthud![Simon Polentia: 72%][Jessica Cananore: 0%]\u201cThe match is over!\u201dJessica fell helplessly to the floor, and the referee shouted,\u201cThe winner is Simon Polentia from Class A!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72\u2018Uhuhhuh\u2026\u2026\u2019Jessica couldn\u2019t get up for a moment after falling to the floor along with the bones.She was feeling embarrassed and ashamed.She got impatient and was provoked by the opponent\u2019s actions, and in the end, she ended up like this by engaging in Combat Magic. No. In fact, it must\u2019ve all been induced by the opponent.With all her skills blocked, all she could do was clench her fists and charge like a bull.A complete defeat in both skill and the psychological warfare.The gap in skill was that huge.\u2018\u2026\u2026So I\u2019ll be placed on the lower squad now. Eh, I guess it\u2019s better this way. The upper squad would be swarming with monsters like him.\u2019When she was letting out a deep sigh while finding the silver lining, Simon approached.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dHe knelt down on one knee, smiled warmly, and held out his hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJessica\u2019s eyes flickered back and forth between Simon\u2019s outstretched hand and his smiling face, her own face blank.Then, suddenly\u2026A mass of emotions surged up, and tears formed in her eyes.\u201cY-You\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cYou disrespectful bastaaaaaard!\u201dScreamed Jessica through her tears. Simon flinched and leaned his head back.\u201cYou must think you\u2019re the only smart person in the world, huh? The audacity to ignore your opponent! To still win the duel! And what, now you\u2019re trying to be all nice at the end? You bastard!\u201cN-No. I just\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the worst! Uwaaaah!\u201dShe ran out of the stadium crying.Simon looked at Jessica\u2019s back with rapt attention as she ran away for a moment.\u201cMister.\u201dThen, the referee approached Simon.\u201cWe need to proceed with the next duel, so please vacate the stadium now.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dWith a sheepish face, Simon asked the referee while scratching his head,\u201cUhmm, was I a bit too harsh a while ago?\u201dThe referee laughed cheerfully as though Simon had said something ridiculous.\u201cIt was very Kizen-like! It\u2019s been a while since I saw a straightforward match like this! Haha.\u201dIt was the first time that the term \u2018Kizen-like\u2019 felt this uncomfortable.As Simon was about to head back, the female manager who was mopping the floor softly said,\u201cHonestly, it was a little bit too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dSimon covered his face with his palms.He was so immersed in his situation that he couldn\u2019t pay attention to the other person\u2019s feelings at all.\u2018\u2026\u2026I guess I\u2019ll have to apologize to her personally tomorrow.\u2019* * *Now all that was left was the midterm exam.The weekend especially was hell. After hearing Rick\u2019s information, Simon started lining up at the library at 4am, but a massive line had already formed.After waiting two more hours, the library door opened, and a huge bottleneck effect happened. Some students soared by stepping on jet-black or running across walls, and a few Necromancy aspirants passed through walls with their Ethereal Form.Seats were filled in 20 minutes, and Simon managed to get a seat in the corner before it was too late.And again, it was just study study study.The library was open all day and all night during the exam period. You were able to concentrate on studying without thinking about anything else.Because Simon was stuck in the library the whole time, the weekend passed like lightning, and the midterm exams started right away.A total of 8 subjects were tested, and two subjects were tested per day, 2 hours being given for each subject.\u201cNumber 2 for Question 8!\u201d\u201cNumber 2! Kyaaah! I got it right!\u201d\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this Number 4? Resistance is created here, blocking the flow of mana, right?\u201d\u201cYou dumbass! Why would there be resistance if this is a direct formula?\u201d\u201cAck! Ah, I didn\u2019t notice that it\u2019s a direct formula!\u201dOnce a test was done, the students flocked to Meilyn or other smart students.Simon saw himself getting interested without realizing it, but there was no time to grade himself.He went back to the library. He had to study. Studying was the only way to live.Everyone said that the exam period was hell, but it wasn\u2019t that bad for Simon. Everyone was moving toward a single goal without caring about anything else.There was no harming or interfering with anyone. It was just seeing your own growth and climbing up.Simon liked this friendly atmosphere of competition.And just like that\u2026\u201cWe\u2026 are\u2026 freeeeeeeeeeee!\u201dThe Defense Against the Holy Arts and Combat Magic exams scheduled for the last day were over.As soon as the bell signifying the end of the test rang, the students all gave broad smiles and pumped their fists.Rick climbed onto the desk with a quill in his mouth, pulled up his shirt, and celebrated while half-shirtless, but he was flatly beaten up by Meilyn.Everyone was going wild with the joy of liberation, but Simon quietly leaned his back against the chair and enjoyed the lingering feeling.\u2018\u2026\u2026I actually really did do my best.\u2019\u201cHey, hey. Simon.\u201dMeilyn approached while folding her hands behind her back.\u201cDid you do well on Summoning? I hope to still see you in Kizen, though~\u201dWhen she playfully asked that, Simon sighed.\u201cFor real, if I could just go back to a month ago, I would hit myself hard in the head.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve realized how carefree my words were.\u201dTo surpass Meilyn\u2019s Summoning score of 85\u2026He thought he could simply get over that 10, but 10 points was a ridiculously large difference.\u2018\u2026\u2026Simon.\u2019Camibarez looked at Simon with a worried look.If Meilyn won and forced Simon to walk out of school, she was planning to prevent it from happening, even if that meant begging to Meilyn.Meilyn was also bewildered.She started it as a joke, but why was he taking it so seriously?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2026\u2026 Did you screw your Summoning up?\u201cNah.\u201dSimon smiled.\u201cIn the end, I\u2019ll win.\u201d\u201cAgh, what was that!\u201dMeilyn burst into laughter, and the mood brightened again.While they were talking about where to go on the weekend and what to eat, Rick stuck his head out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you while you guys are planning, but I have an important issue. Wanna hear?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRick looked around and made sure no one was listening, then said in a secretive tone,* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *\u201cAfter this weekend is over, the whole first year may go to the island next week. Island Survival.Meilyn\u2019s face seriously stiffened at those words, and Simon and Camibarez looked at each other with puzzled eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dRick let out a creepy smile and waved his fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s a project where they drop the entire first year on an island swarming with monsters and make them survive for 4 days. It\u2019s also called the Island Survival assessment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026F-For four days?\u201dCamibarez gripped her shoulders in horror.\u201cAfter entering the island, you have to take care of all food and shelter yourself, and you have to hunt monsters and earn points. You can even get points by fighting students. Naturally, as expected from Kizen, the students who rank the lowest are expelled.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dContrary to Camibarez trembling in fear, Simon\u2019s eyes were shining.\u201cWhat\u2019s with you this time?\u201d\u201cNo, uhm\u2026\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t hide the corners of his lips rising and continued to speak.\u201cThat sounds hella fun, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYeah. A deserted island, camping, hunting, and surviving against monster attacks! Wow, I love it all.\u201dSimon had lots of experience like that in the rugged mountains of Les Hill.On the other hand, Rick and Camibarez looked as though they couldn\u2019t understand Simon in the slightest.\u201cBy the way, are you sure about that information?\u201dInterrupted Meilyn.\u201cHow do you even know about Kizen\u2019s schedule?\u201d\u201cNah, nah.\u201dRick waved his hand.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not 100%. It\u2019s still in the speculation stage.\u201d\u201cSpeculation based on what?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, the servants are secretly taking out tongue pads from the warehouse.\u201dThe tongue pad was a device that students would wear on their arms when taking large-scale performance assessments such as Island Survival. With this, you could check your points and more.\u201cAnd I heard that, two days ago, all of the teleporting team at Kizen headquarters moved to the school and started working on a large-scale project, bringing in a lot of magic circle ingredients from Rochest. Some professors even made vacation reservations for next week. There\u2019s obviously a class next week, but why a sudden vacation reservation? Isn\u2019t it kinda obvious?\u201dEveryone was surprised by the quality of the plausible information. Rick crossed his arms and gave himself airs.\u201cHehe, having this much strength in information is the basics for surviving the tough world!\u201d\u201cAmazing! Rick, how do you know so many things going around in Kizen?\u201dAfter being filled with pride when Camibarez looked at him with admiration, Rick said,\u201cFor confidentiality reasons, I can\u2019t really share my core information route, but\u2026 Well, first of all, I try to be friends with all the servants of Kizen, you know? Even if they find me overwhelming at first, I follow around them, treating them like they\u2019re my brothers and sisters, sometimes giving them pocket money or buying them meals, and even lending my name as a Kizen student at times.\u201dSimon nodded his head.When he hung around with Rick, most of the servants talked comfortably with Rick, a Kizen student.\u201cStudents from noble families think of servants as helpers, and they don\u2019t really care, right? However, servants are the source of information.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. You\u2019ve got such a big head.\u201dMeilyn turned her head and scoffed through her nose.This time, Simon opened his mouth.\u201cSo, what should we prepare if that performance assessment is happening?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 I wonder. I believe we just have to power up like how we usually prepare for a Duel Evaluation. Oh, and\u2026\u201dRick cried out in a moment of genius,\u201cSurvival skills!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cYou know, those things like building a shelter, making a fire, skinning, carving the hunts, and identifying edible herbs.\u201dThe faces of the two girls suddenly darkened.\u201cTh-That\u2019s true. We might end up having to eat\u2026\u2026 monsters.\u201dMeilyn, who was always full of confidence, showed herself faltering. Camibarez also had a pale complexion.\u201c\u2026\u2026Can\u2019t we just starve for a few days?\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s as easy as it sounds? Plus, if you starve yourself, you won\u2019t have strength, making it hard for you to resist the attacks of monsters and other students. You have to eat to survive.\u201dAfter understanding the situation, the two\u2019s faces gradually darkened.On the other hand\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, it\u2019s gonna be so much fun.\u201dSimon had a good complexion. The three of them looked at him like they couldn\u2019t understand Simon at all.\u201cThis won\u2019t do.\u201dSaid Meilyn.\u201cI\u2019m going down to Rochest to eat monster meat this weekend.\u201dRick giggled.\u201cYou think something will change if you eat those things sold in public? There\u2019s a difference between the dishes prepared by the chefs and the ones eaten on the actual site.\u201d\u201cAh, whatever! My taste might change a little!\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it\u2026\u201dWhen Simon opened his mouth, everyone\u2019s gazes gathered.\u201cRemember that meat soup we ate at Professor Hong Feng\u2019s hut?\u201d\u201cAh! That one! That was super delicious!\u201d\u201cIt crosses my mind now and then.\u201dSimon grinned and continued.\u201cActually, she told me that it was made from monster meat.\u201dThe eyes of the three of them lit up.\u201cHey!!\u201dMeilyn flew towards Simon and grabbed his collar, shaking him.\u201cPlease try contacting Professor Hong Feng to teach us some tricks! The professor is especially fond of you!\u201dShe shook Simon, her face pleading.Simon said with a bitter smile,\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work or not, but I\u2019ll try sending her a letter.\u201d\u201cY-You\u2019re being serious, right?\u201d\u201cI beg you, Simon!\u201dAnd the next day\u2026Hong Feng\u2019s reply did actually arrive.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73A golden weekend morning after midterms.The main gate of Kizen was crowded with students trying to go down to Rochest.On one side of the gate, a long line of carriages that had received reservations were waiting. Students who wanted to go picnicking in the valley or on the beach were bargaining with the wagoners.And if there were students who were excited, looking forward to such a happy holiday,\u201cAh\u2026 for reeaal! What\u2019s this?!\u201dThere were also students hanging onto running wild hippos since the weekend morning.Meilyn was making a long face.\u201cI was crazy! Secret technique of cooking monsters, my ass\u2026\u2026!\u201dTo be in this kind of situation on this golden weekend\u2026Meilyn wanted to strike her past self in the head like a certain other person once said.It started like this.Meilyn and Camibarez begged Simon to learn Hong Feng\u2019s monster cuisine, and Simon sent a letter to Hong Feng.Hong Feng gladly responded to the letter and informed him of the time and meeting place.When Simon and his comrades arrived at the meeting point after finishing their preparations, four hippos were grazing around.\u2026\u2026And that was it.\u201cHey, Meilyn! Aren\u2019t you in a dangerous position in many ways right now?\u201dRick, hanging on the hippo behind her, teased her as usual, but Meilyn responded as though finding him pathetic.\u201cI\u2019m wearing shorts today, you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cAh, how did you not fall for this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you after I get off this thing, honestly.\u201dShe growled and pulled Rick down with force before stealthily turning her head.Camibarez was now hanging on with a resigned look, and Simon was\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026It pisses me off that he, yet again, is the only one riding it well.\u2019Simon held the hippo\u2019s body with his two legs and kept his balance sitting upright. Only the assistants rode like that. It was a whole different level of stability.After going through such a difficult time, the four finally arrived at their destination.\u201cHuff! Phew! Whoa, that was so tiring! We just got here, but we\u2019re already out of energy.\u201dRick gasped for air as he rested his hands on his knees. Meilyn and Camibarez were already lying on the grass.Simon was the only one standing upright and checking Hong Feng\u2019s letter.\u201cLet\u2019s take a short break and depart right away.\u201dHong Feng said that it wasn\u2019t difficult to teach the recipe for cooking monster, but she needed prey. So, she suggested hunting a monster called a nustlelack.It was some kind of a mission.According to Hong Feng, the nustlelack was an invasive species and was disturbing the forests of Roke Island.It was a monster that originally lived inland. Still, somehow it came to Roke Island, and its population increased drastically due to its tremendous eating habits and reproductive rate.Hong Feng\u2019s mission was to capture the leader of the nustlelacks.She mentioned that the monster would be butchered and eaten after the hunt was over, so capturing the boss monster as unscathed as possible was important.\u201cUnnng\u2026 No matter how much I think about it, it feels like we were handed work.\u201dMuttered Meilyn as she stood up. Simon said in a soft voice as though comforting her,\u201cProfessor Hong Feng must have her ways of thinking. It\u2019s a win-win, since we can practice hunting monsters too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cSimon!\u201dCamibarez rushed towards Simon.\u201cWhat is it, Cami?\u201dHiding behind Simon\u2019s back, she stretched out her hand, a tense expression on her face.\u201cO-Over there!\u201dSimon\u2019s head turned.Perhaps they smelled the scent of humans. Three nustlelacks were prowling around and approaching them.They had a short and blunt body, their whole body was covered with turquoise hair, and their faces looked like a mix between a gorilla and a pig.\u201cI\u2019m gonna go insane. Do we have to eat something like that today?\u201dScowled Meilyn, and Rick chuckled.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be pretty good. Might taste like monkey meat.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never tried that!\u201d[Gourrgh!]The nustlelacks started rushing toward them.\u2018Ah, come to think of it\u2026\u2019Simon turned his head and looked at his group members.The members, busy preparing dark spells, opened their eyes wide and looked at Simon as if wondering if there was something wrong.\u2018This is the first time we\u2019ve all properly fought together.\u2019There were restrictions on the set position in the Cyclops performance assessment, but it was different today. A stage where everyone could fully put their strengths together and fight.Simon felt strangely excited by that fact and turned his head back to the front.\u201cI\u2019ll start.\u201dSimon pulled the virtual lever.He took out skeletons armed with spears and shields from the subspace one by one. A skeleton with a shield rushed forward and clashed with a nustlelack.Kakiing!!The nustlelack\u2019s main weapon was its sharp claws and teeth. While the shield skeletons blocked the attack, a skeleton with a spear turned around and thrust its spear.Pshk!The tip of the spear stabbed the nustlelack\u2019s body. However, it couldn\u2019t pierce through because of the beast\u2019s strong muscles.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dAt that moment, Rick approached with gentle movement and lightly touched the skeleton\u2019s spear.\u2018Enchant.\u2019The spear was dyed black, and it pierced through the nustlelack\u2019s body before coming out the other end. The monster\u2019s eyes flipped over and drooped.\u201cBe careful~ More of them are coming from the left and right.\u201d\u201cWe know!\u201dCrackle!As Meilyn, standing on the right, swung her arms, black flames spread across the nustlelacks, leaving them writhing in agony.\u201cHyaaah!\u201dCamibarez could be seen firing blood bullets from a kneeling position on Simon\u2019s left.The moment the blood bullets hit a nustlelack\u2019s body, a red explosion boomed out. It had the destructive power to shatter the upper half of the monster with one blow.Simon also moved.He pulled out three skeleton archers from the subspace, and Simon himself also took out the gold bow he got for free from the weapon shop.\u2018Load.\u2019Shk.Simon and the skeletons simultaneously loaded an arrow into their bows and pulled their strings taut.\u2018Fire!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *When Simon naturally released the power in his right hand holding the arrow along with the command, not one but four arrows flew at the same time.Psssshhhhk!Soon, they stuck into a nustlelack running toward him.Two shots to the head and two to the chest. It died and collapsed right away.\u2018Reload.\u2019Shk\u2026 Sshhk.Simon and the skeleton archers reloaded their arrows in unison.\u2018Fire!\u2019This time, the arrows flew in different directions. Nustlelacks approaching through the bushes were hit by arrows one by one and collapsed.\u201cOn the front! They keep on coming from the front!\u201dShouted Rick.More than six nustlelacks were rushing all at once from the grass.Seeing that, Meilyn said,\u201cSimon! Cami and I have enough firepower, so please pay more attention to tanking!\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dOne of the strengths of Summoners was that they could move flexibly depending on the battle situation.Simon put the archers back into the subspace and resummoned the normal skeletons.He lined up six skeletons with shields using cross-operation.\u201cEnchant is going in!\u201dRick took out a shield from his subspace, enchanted it, and gave it to the skeleton without a shield, completing the defensive line in the blink of an eye.Thump!Thuuump!The nustlelacks who rushed in immediately slammed into the line of shields with their whole bodies, but Simon clenched his teeth and maintained the formation.\u2018Hang in there!\u2019He repeatedly alternated between the thoughts of skeletons 1, 3, and 5, and then the thoughts of 2, 4, and 6.Since the skeletons\u2019 defenses loosened in those few seconds when his thoughts were cut off, he had to endure it with cross-operation.\u201c\u2026\u2026Urk! I won\u2019t last long!\u201d\u201cBack off now, Simon!\u201dSimon raised his head.Meilyn, who had soared high in the sky before he realized it, was clutching a burning black flame in the palm of her hand. She spun in a circle once and swung her arm straight down.<Dark Flare>Fwoooooooooosh!Dark flames fell on the heads of the nustlelacks, causing a massive explosion. However, the skeletons retreated safely, avoiding getting caught up.A near perfect level of control. Charred ashes crumbled in front of the shields.\u201cNice, Meilyn!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201dAfter gently descending to the ground, she smiled while combing her hair back under her ear.[Gourururugh]Just then, a nustlelack ran toward her from behind her back. She looked back, flicking her sky-blue hair around.Booooooom!Immediately, a red explosion erupted from the monster\u2019s body, and it fell to its knees. In the distance, Camibarez was seen lowering her hand.\u201cThank you, Cami!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dSimon and his comrades started marching forward after overcoming the crisis. They went deep into the forest, defeating each of the nustlelacks that came out one by one.Could it be because of the Cyclops performance assessment? The four people worked in harmony, and it was almost perfect.\u201cWoah, it\u2019s no joke.\u201dSaid Rick, who cut through a nustlelack\u2019s body while looking behind him.One side of the forest was completely dyed black by Meilyn\u2019s firepower.\u201cBy the way, Meilyn, is it okay to use fire-based dark magic like that in a thick forest like this? What if you cause a forest fire?\u201d\u201cDumbass.\u201dMeilyn frowned while drawing a magic circle.\u201cThe flames of the jet-black elemental system are artificially materialized flames, so they will go away over time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cSo you piss off too, please.\u201d\u201cYohoo~ good roast right there!\u201d\u201cGosh.\u201dMeanwhile, Camibarez was gasping for breath, looking as though she had used too much blood. She was also feeling slightly anemic, and her head was starting to feel dizzy.\u201cCami, are you alright?\u201dSimon quickly approached her and checked her condition.Her gaze went toward the smooth nape below Simon\u2019s face for a moment.Her heart throbbed frantically all of a sudden, and she felt very thirsty. Her mouth opened on its own and she felt a twinge in the ridge of her nose.Just once.Just once will do. Let me put my fangs in there and take as much as I wa\u2014\u201cCami?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dStartled, she backed off to a seated position and covered her mouth. Simon tilted his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cN-N-N-Nothing! It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a little dizzy.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s take a break.\u201dSimon waved to Rick and Meilyn, who were going ahead, signaling a break. They both nodded, also feeling the need to take a break.\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019Camibarez buried her face in the palms of her hands.It had been almost 5 years since she felt the instincts of a vampire. She thought she had completely suppressed them now, but Simon continued to shake those thoughts of hers.\u201cCami! Are you alright?\u201dMeilyn came running, but Camibarez forced a smile and said that she was fine.Meanwhile, Rick was looking at the traces on the floor.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that the head nustlelack is around here. I see more footprints that are much bigger than the usual nustlelack\u2019s. I think it was here until very recently.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dSimon took out something large from the subspace and dropped it on the floor.It was nothing other than the golem\u2019s core.\u201cThen I\u2019ll prepare the golem while we\u2019re taking a break. Let\u2019s break through the forest with this in one go.\u201d\u201cOh, good idea!\u201dSimon dug a little in the ground with his hands and placed the golem\u2019s core in the hole. Soon after connecting the golem\u2019s core to his thoughts, he began to form jet-black.Whir. Whirrr.The soil began to stick to the Golem\u2019s core like a magnet. It was the first time seeing a golem being made for everyone, so they watched with fascination.Stomp! Stomp!As 1/3 of the golem was completed, unusually loud footsteps could be heard.Rick drew his sword and shouted,\u201cEveryone, be careful! Something is coming this way!\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!The footsteps were getting faster and faster.Simon and his party jumped up from their seats and stayed alert.Soon, a monster tore through the surrounding bushes and lept out. It was bigger than any other nustlelack they had ever seen.\u201cThat\u2019s the boss!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Indeed. It\u2019s pretty huge.\u201dIt was two heads taller than the normal, small nustlelacks, and countless wounds could be seen on its body. Hair didn\u2019t grow where it had been scratched, exposing its ugly bare skin.[Grouugh! Grourourough!]It lowered its stance. Unlike its front, where its fat belly protruded, its back looked thin and flexible enough that you could even see the spine.Its gaze was directed at the golem core.While Simon was preparing the golem, it sensed the jet-black around him shaking, so it appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u201dThe nustlelack rushed in. Simon also ran forward and said,\u201cRick! Shield!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dRick threw the enchanted shield to Simon. Simon grabbed the shield by the handle and pulled it to the end of his chin before clashing with the nustlelack.Pooooow!!\u201cUwah!\u201dSimon was pushed back in the battle of strength and got sent flying.Perhaps because of the impact, the soil on the golem\u2019s still-being-completed arm crumbled to the ground.\u201cSimon!\u201dSaid Rick as he grabbed his sword and rushed in.\u201cLeave this guy to us and focus on completing the golem!\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cover you!\u201dAs Simon retreated, Camibarez fired Blood Bullets. Seeing a flying projectile, the nustlelack lightly jumped to the side and dodged it, sending a chill down Rick\u2019s spine.\u2018Contrary to how it looks, its reflexes are good!\u2019The nustlelack moved again, aiming for the golem. Rick ran straight ahead and tried to stop him, but there was a girl who jumped into the air faster than him.Rooooaaaar!As she beckoned, black fire poured down like rain. The nearby grass burst into flame, and the nustlelack seemed to back away.\u201cI\u2019m telling you that we\u2019re going to eat that! Please hold back your burning!\u201dWith Rick\u2019s shout, Meilyn got furious and turned to look at him.\u201cIs that really the problem right now? No, other than that, even if we\u2019re eating it, we\u2019ll cook it on a fire anyway!\u201dWhish!The nustlelack started running in the opposite direction, where there was no fire.Meilyn and Rick were also running after the nustlelack, and Rick nodded with a serious face.\u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re right. If we consider it as pre-grilled, then\u2014\u201d\u201cFocus, you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always focused.\u201dPooow!The nustlelack stamped hard on the ground and jumped high enough to soar over the both of them.Seeing this, Rick took something out of the subspace and threw it backward while spinning his body.Wooosh!A pure white net spread over a wide area in the air, covering the front of the nustlelack floating in the air, and Rick immediately cast a dark spell.\u2018Enchant!\u2019The entire net was dyed with jet-black. With nimble movements, Rick pulled out a metal stake, stabbed it to the ground, and hung the net on the stake.\u201cMove!\u201dMeilyn gathered jet-black on her elbow and slammed it straight onto the stake.With a thud, the stakes were driven deep into the ground.\u201cOww!\u201dShe frowned and rubbed her elbows. Rick quickly lifted his head and looked at the nustlelack.The net was pulled taut, and eventually, the tired nustlelack fell to the ground.\u201cIt worked! We got it!\u201dBzzt.However, there were parts where the enchantment wasn\u2019t done properly due to the nature of the net, it being so large and full of holes.After skillfully finding a torn part, the nustlelack ran out and rushed toward Simon.\u201cRick! This stupid ass really just\u2014!\u201dPooooooooooooooooooow!Noise resembling the crack of thunder sounded out before Meilyn even finished her words, and the nustlelack\u2019s body flew away, ragdolling. Soon, it smashed into a few trees and rolled over to the ground.Everyone opened their mouths and looked back.\u201cDid I make you wait?\u201dSimon smiled with his fist outstretched. Above him, a large Mud Golem was taking the same stance as Simon.\u201cBwahaha! Nice save, Simon!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you to finish it, Simon. And Rick, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d[Grouugh! Groououugh!]The nustlelack, covered in blood and lying on the floor, jumped up and rushed forward, screaming with anger.\u201cWhy thank you. If you\u2019re coming at me\u2026\u201dSimon took a fighting stance.The nustlelack leaped forward with all his might toward the mud golem, its nails tripling in length.Slash!It made three claw marks on the golem\u2019s body.But that was it.The mud golem raised its arms overhead, hands clasped together.\u201cAh, Simon.\u201dSaid Rick.\u201cI\u2019m saying this again, but that\u2019s our dinner today, so go eas\u2014\u201dBaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!The golem\u2019s clasped hands slammed the nustlelack down with enough force to create a cloud of dust, and a deep hole was left in the ground.\u201cOuch.\u201d\u201cKyah!\u201dRick and Camibarez, who were close, jumped back.Meanwhile, the nustlelack trembled as though it was still alive despite that impact.This time, the mud golem raised its leg.Slaaaaaaaam!It then continued to trample the beast.Looking at this, Rick nodded with a serious face.\u201cI guess we can just make stir-fried ground meat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Why are you so obsessed with eating all of a sudden?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *They successfully completed Hong Feng\u2019s mission.After hunting the boss and cleaning up the rest of the monsters, Simon and his comrades were now resting and waiting.While they were having a nice little chat, someone came to them through the bushes.\u201cSo you were here.\u201dA man with sun-tanned brown skin, short crew-cut hair, and a somewhat glum look.It was Brett, an assistant teacher under Hong Feng.\u201cThank you for your effort. I have finished installing the teleport magic circle, so let\u2019s proceed to where Professor Hong Feng is waiting.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dIt was finally over!Everyone followed after Brett, talking peacefully. A magic circle was spread out on the floor beyond the bushes.\u201cThank you, assistant teacher!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go ahead!\u201dMeilyn, Rick, and Camibarez stepped through the magic circle.Finally, when Simon was about to step through the magic circle\u2026\u201cHold on.\u201dBrett raised his arm and blocked Simon.\u201cYou, spare me some time to talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust a moment will do.\u201dSimon turned to him.\u201cWell, if you have something to say, why don\u2019t you say it after we move on?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBrett let out an annoyed sigh and raised his right arm.Snap!A whole tree fell down with a crackling sound, creating a haze of dust behind him.\u201cHey.\u201dBrett\u2019s eyes turned furious.\u201cI\u2019m not gonna say it again. Fuck being an assistant teacher or Kizen student or whatever. I\u2019m asking you to talk with me man-to-man.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at his air, it seemed that he was fully determined.Simon nodded his head, thinking that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to go through him easily.\u201cAlright. Then please take the lead.\u201dThe two stood facing each other a short distance from the teleport magic circle.\u201cHaaaah, kids these days are so damn fucking mannerless. Something I couldn\u2019t even dare to imagine back in my day is happening.\u201d\u201cPlease let me know if I have done anything wrong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll actually kill you.\u201dBrett frowned hard.\u201cWho are you to give Professor Hong Feng some work? Huh? The fuck? Could you teach us survival skills? Hahaha! Fucking non-sense, for real. Is Professor Hong Feng your private tutor or something?\u201dSimon still had a smile on his lips as he spoke.\u201cI think you\u2019re exceeding your authority for an assistant teacher to talk about things between the Professor and me. Of course, I\u2019m really sorry that we unintentionally called you on the weekend to pick us u\u2014\u201dThud!Simon shut his mouth. The stone that Brett had kicked was stuck in the tree next to Simon.A hole was punched in on the tree, and white-ish smoke was coming out.\u201cDo you think I called you for something like that?\u201dBrett pointed his thick finger at Simon.\u201cYou\u2019re fucking playing with Professor Hong Feng\u2019s heart right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cHah! This bastard isn\u2019t even aware of it.\u201dPtooh!Brett spat on the ground.\u201cThe world seems so easy since you\u2019re a Special Admission No.1, right? I know that the Professor offered you a seat as a direct disciple, and you\u2019re using that as bait to use the Professor.\u201dWhat kind of bullshit was this guy talking about?\u201cYou fucking filthy bastard! Do you even know how kind-hearted the Professor is? You\u2019re tricking a person\u2019s heart by using the direct disciple as a bai\u2014\u201d\u201cThere seems to be a misunderstanding.\u201dSimon cut him off and corrected him.\u201cThe Professor indeed offered me direct discipleship, but I immediately turned it down.\u201dBrett\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou declined?\u201d\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t vaguely brush it off but clearly expressed my intention to refuse. The Professor respected my decision and said she personally wondered how far I could go. And even if I\u2019m not her direct disciple, she told me that I can always ask her if I need her help as a disciple. So, it\u2019s not true that I\u2019m playing with the Professor\u2019s heart as you said, assistant teacher.\u201dBrett didn\u2019t say anything, and Simon immediately continued.\u201cThe last time we were invited to the hut, Professor suggested it first, thankfully. Again, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dThe corners of Brett\u2019s lips twisted.\u201cAre you seriously telling me that bullshit? Then, are you saying that Professor Hong Feng is deliberately working for nothing? Does that make any sense?\u201dBang!Brett hit his chest.\u201cI have served the Professor for 5 years. For 5 damn years! I know the Professor\u2019s thoughts better than anyone! What does a 1-month-old freshman know to be able to blabber something?\u201dSimon smirked.This wouldn\u2019t do. He was the type that didn\u2019t listen.He\u2019d keep saying he\u2019s right no matter what I say.\u2018Nah.\u2019Simon felt a fighting spirit eminating from Brett\u2019s body.From the first time he approached Simon, he had no intention of talking it out.\u201cWear it.\u201dBrett took something out of his subspace and threw it at Simon.It was a protective suit.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-purity protective suit that\u2019s on a whole different level from the one used in Duel Evaluation or simulation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to argue with each other. Let\u2019s just decide with this one.\u201dBrett waved his fist.\u201cIf you can hit me at least once before the protective suit\u2019s barrier breaks, then this didn\u2019t happen, and I\u2019ll do whatever you want, whether it\u2019s an apology, compensation, or retirement.\u201d\u201cThen, what if I don\u2019t get to land a hit?\u201dBrett paused for a moment. Then, he took a deep breath.\u201cAccept Professor Hong Feng\u2019s offer to be her direct disciple.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018This is quite unexpected.\u2019He thought Brett was a typical idiot who was blinded by jealousy, but did he find Hong Feng more important than his own feelings?\u201cI feel sorry for that, but\u2026\u201dSimon scratched the side of his head.Imposing your thoughts on others by any means is a lowly, garbage act. And\u2026Simon put on the protective suit.\u201cI have no intention of backing down when it comes to a fight.\u201dI have to turn the situation around while pretending to face him for a while.Simon\u2019s head began to work extremely hard.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75The corners of Brett\u2019s lips rose.\u201cAt least you\u2019re high-spirited. Here I go!\u201dBrett stamped down on the dirt and rushed forward, and Simon just watched, his eyes wide open.His movement was peculiar. It was extremely intimidating to see a man the size of a gorilla approaching him while twisting his body from side to side.\u2018A right straight punch.\u2019The moment Simon\u2019s head was about to move, with a\u00a0swoosh, Brett\u2019s arm reached in front of Simon without any mid-movement.Spowww!A tsunami-like impact passed the barrier and struck his face.Simon clenched his fist at the same time he took the blow and thrust it, but Brett had lowered his stance already and was moving toward Simon\u2019s left.Spaaaw!A fist hit his right.Poooooooow!Another went into his left.\u201cKugh!\u201dSimon staggered and stepped back. Each blow could\u2019ve made him faint or even die if it weren\u2019t for the protective suit he was wearing.\u201cHahaha! What are you doing?\u201dSimon wiped his lips and somehow followed the movement of his opponent.\u2018This bastard\u2026 Is he actually trying to win against me?\u2019Seeing that, Brett was speechless.To be frank, it was a fight that made no sense, even for Brett himself. No matter what the excuses were, this was a situation in which an assistant teacher who had worked at Kizen for 5 years was beating up a first-year freshman.Anyone who heard this story would criticize him. He had no excuses to make, even if they called this bullying or simply blowing off steam.Nevertheless.\u2018My anger will never subside if I don\u2019t do this!\u2019Smaaaaaaaaaash!A clean hit pierced his abdomen. Simon\u2019s body was greatly bent, and a following elbow strike from Brett hit Simon in the back of the head and knocked him to the floor.\u2018This bastard will become Professor Hong Feng\u2019s direct disciple. Then I\u2019ll have to fix his manners even more now!\u2019The moment Brett raised his leg and tried to trample Simon\u2019s head\u2026Clunk!Simon instead twisted toward Brett\u2019s ankle and grabbed it.\u2018\u2026\u2026What the?!\u2019Whap!At the same time, Simon\u2019s two legs wrapped around Brett\u2019s legs like a curling snake, and he applied force by turning his body in a connecting motion. Brett\u2019s body swayed and he was placed in a position where his back was turned.\u2018Grappling?\u2019And the skeleton that came out of Simon\u2019s subspace threw a spear at Brett.\u2018Look at this bastard.\u2019It was an unstable posture, but Brett quickly gathered jet-black on his palm and exploded it.An application of Wind Wave, a skill in Combat Magic. The harsh wind blew away both the spear and the skeleton.Meanwhile, Simon released Brett\u2019s leg and escaped to the other side.\u201cPretty good. Were you a fighter before coming to Kizen?\u201dSimon raised his fists at Brett\u2019s question.\u201cI was just studying under my father about a lord\u2019s work.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me to believe that?!\u201dBrett rushed in again. Simon took out two skeletons and sent them left and right, then lowered his stance.\u2018There\u2019s no need to think about other conditions. It\u2019s my victory as long as I can get one hit.\u2019In addition to the speed at which Brett was running toward him, Simon also stepped on jet-black and rushed forward.Simon stretched out his arm when the distance between the two had narrowed enough to almost clash.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHowever, Brett\u2019s body disappeared in an instant. Simon\u2019s arm passed through the air, and at the same time, he felt a hand gripping his waist.\u2018Your moves are so obvious!\u2019A perfect stance for a suplex. Brett turned his body over and bent his back like a shrimp.Simon\u2019s head and neck crashed to the floor, unsettling the dust around him.Brett, who had successfully finished his move, got up after releasing Simon from his arms.Whooooooosh!Simon\u2019s leg that came out from the dust hit Brett\u2019s arm with a\u00a0pang\u00a0and got blocked.\u2018Kicking while falling\u2026 Does this bastard even take any shock?\u2019This kick was a fake. Brett quickly covered his face with his opposite arm.Poooow!As expected, Simon\u2019s opposite leg hit, creating a shock wave. Simon\u2019s leg returned, and countless feet were thrust in.It was a continuous hitting technique using kicks.Whish! Whish! Whish!Brett stepped and pulled his shoulder back to dodge them.The corners of his lips rose.\u2018He\u2019s actually pretty good. Where did a bastard like this really come out of?\u201dIt was embarrassing, but his blood was boiling against a freshman.He thought Simon was the typical Special Admission No.1\u2014a dead wood who was only good at studying\u2014but now he understood a little about why Professor Hong Feng was shaken up with this guy.\u2018This bastard has both physical and innate talents. However, his stance is unstable, and the strength isn\u2019t being transferred properly. He lacks the systematic training from experts.\u2019It must\u2019ve been the same for Professor Hong Feng.How could you not feel your fingers itch if there\u2019s such a genius right in front of you\u2026\u2026!Crack!Brett looked back in surprise. Two falling trees formed an X coming toward him as he was stepping back.Skeletons sent by Simon had struck the tree with axes and knocked it down.\u2018When did he send the skeletons\u2026\u2026?!\u2019To think he had the energy to spare to connect with the thoughts while dealing with me.Brett wrapped his fists in jet-black while avoiding Simon\u2019s kick.Clink. Clink.As Brett opened his fists, a jagged blade of jet-black flew like a knife and slashed the tree in two.This time, it was an application of the Combat Magic skill Bayonet. The tree split in half and fell to the floor, and Brett fixed his stance.Then, Simon continued to rush in.\u2018Let\u2019s end this.\u2019When Brett twisted his waist and tried to thrust forward his fist with all his might, Simon clenched his teeth and thrust out his forehead first, making Brett\u2019s eyes widen.\u2018Does this bastard really wanna d\u2014!\u2019\u201cBone Nail.\u201dSimon raised his finger.Shk shshk.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dA skeleton\u2019s sharp bones cut a wound on his thigh. His skin was torn, and blood dripped from it.\u2018What? Why is this here\u2026?!\u2019His gaze shifted. He could see the bones of the skeleton stuck on the surface of the tree that fell to the floor.\u2018So it was all planned from the beginning!\u2019Brett, who had been focused on grasping the situation for a moment, felt an eerie energy and lifted his head.Bwwoooooooooosh!Simon\u2019s legs twisted in mid-air and drew a huge curve as they descended, making Brett hurriedly cover his head with his arms.Whaaam!\u201cKuhugh!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t block it properly because of how fast it was. Blood spewed from his nose, and Brett stepped back.Simon grinned after landing on the ground.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to make any excuses with this, right? It\u2019s my victory.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Snap.The thread of patience holding together Brett\u2019s rationality broke.\u201c\u2026\u2026Bwaha. Hahahahahahaha!\u201dRrrrruuuuummmmble!A tremendous amount of jet-black rose from Brett\u2019s whole body.It stretched out into the air and wrapped around his body like a garment.The symbol of Combat Magic majors, Black Robe.In a blink of an eye, Brett was wrapped in black armor.\u201cI admit it. I admit it.\u201dSaid Brett while gnashing his teeth.\u201cI lost, and the promise is valid. Whatever measure it is, I\u2019ll obey you. However, before I leave Kizen!\u201dHe clenched his fist.\u201cIf I don\u2019t wreck you here right now, I think I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon let out a deep sigh.\u201cIsn\u2019t this different from the promise? How pathetic do you want to be?\u201d\u201cWhatever you say, it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d\u201cOkay, then do whatever you want.\u201dBrett\u2019s eyebrows twitched as Simon let his arms hang loose.\u201cWhat are you doing?! Ready yourself right now!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to reach the limit of my patience with you. I\u2019m going to do what I want to do. If you were gonna be like this, just beat me up already.\u201d\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhen Brett approached Simon and grabbed him by his collar, exuding bloodthirst\u2026\u201cBrett!!!\u201dA huge shout that could burst your eardrums shook the island.Brett turned his head, startled, and then his mouth opened widely.\u201cP-Professor Hong Feng\u2026\u2026?\u201dHong Feng was approaching him with a bloody expression on her face. Brett felt his blood turning cold and quickly removed his black robe.\u201cAssistant Brett.\u201dHong Feng approached and stared at Brett. It was completely different from her usual gentle and kind demeanor.\u201cExplain.\u201dBrett was sweating profusely, standing in the parade rest stance.\u201cI-I was giving a lesson to Simon by sparr\u2014\u201dSlaaaaaaap!Hong Feng slapped Brett\u2019s cheek. With that alone, Brett\u2019s body flew dozens of meters and rolled around on the dirt floor.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019Brett fell to the ground and grabbed his cheek.In his 5 years of serving Hong Feng, he had never once been hit by her.But now, he realized it with this one blow. This power was definitely Hong Feng.\u201cStand up.\u201dAt her words, Brett stood up upright and approached her. His cheeks were red and swollen.\u201cTurn.\u201dBrett looked back.\u201cStarting now, stay in the most painful stance for you, assistant.\u201d\u201cWh-What? What do you mean by painful sta\u2014\u201d\u201cDo it.\u201dAt her words, Brett immediately slammed his head on the ground and lifted his body up.In that state, he raised himself up with his fingertip, maintaining his weight with one finger, and then unfolded the hem of his black robe and raised the cloak up to the sky.A state that required the use of both stamina and jet-black. Just looking at it felt terribly painful.\u201cSimon!\u201dHong Feng approached. Her expression was dyed with a deep sense of relief.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I was wearing a protective suit, so\u2014\u201d\u201cIt looks like your face is very swollen.\u201dWhile saying that, she grabbed Simon\u2019s cheek with both hands and pinched it like a massage.\u201cP-Professor?\u201d\u201cHow about here? Here?\u201dThen, she groped Simon\u2019s forearm and abdomen with one hand, grabbed Simon\u2019s cheek with the other hand, and began to stretch it like a rice cake.No matter how much you thought about it, it was a touch full of ulterior motives. Simon clenched his teeth and spoke silently.\u201cI\u2019m telling you to stop it\u2026\u2026\u201dTruthfully, this woman wasn\u2019t Hong Feng. This was Elizabeth, having transformed into Hong Feng.She originally came to collect the nustlelack corpses at Simon\u2019s order, but a fight between Simon and Brett broke out, so she transformed into Hong Feng and intervened.Elizabeth memorized the voices of the Kizen professors and important figures in case they needed it for escaping from Kizen. She tilted her head and spoke in Simon\u2019s ear so that only he could hear it.\u201cHow was it? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m being a help to you now, Commander?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I know I survived thanks to you, but please get away from me.\u201dShe grinned and grabbed the button on Simon\u2019s uniform shirt while impersonating Hong Feng\u2019s voice.\u201cSimon. I think I have to look at your wound over here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026There\u2019s no wound there, Professor.\u201dSaid Simon while trembling.He shouldn\u2019t be caught by Brett, so he had no choice but to play along with her.As Simon beckoned to hurry the things up, Elizabeth opened her mouth, and she combed her hair up while looking bummed out.\u201cAssistant Brett.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, Professor!\u201dIn the end, Brett was beating himself with a black robe made of jet-black. He was faithfully fulfilling the order of remaining in the most painful position.\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with this matter. Keep that stance for 20 hours from now, and then return.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dBut wasn\u2019t 20 hours just a bit too much?This thought was clear on Simon\u2019s face, but Elizabeth put her hand on her chest as though telling Simon to leave it to her.\u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, please act naturally, and never speak of this incident to anyone, including myself. Just act as if nothing ever happened. Thinking about it makes me want to tear you apart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, I understand.\u201d\u201cAnd never lay your hand on Simon ever again. If something like this happens again\u2026\u201dHer eyes gleamed.\u201cThere is no second chance.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Simon.\u201dElizabeth took Simon\u2019s hand and took him away.Brett didn\u2019t even dare to look back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Elizabeth led the corpse spiders and went to retrieve the nustlelack corpses, originally coming here for that reason. Simon alone stepped on the teleport magic circle and moved to another place.The place he arrived was near Hong Feng\u2019s hut.\u201cSimon!\u201dCamibarez greeted him with a wide smile. In fact, she was getting worried about Simon being late, so she kept on glancing to her side at the magic circle.\u201cSorry I was late.\u201dShe came running in a heartbeat and looked at Simon with worried eyes.\u201cDid something happen between you and the assistant teacher?\u201dSimon quickly put his brain to work.He could beat around the bush and tell her that it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but things could get annoying if he got asked the same question by Rick and Meilyn.He thought that it\u2019d be better to give some appropriate reason here.\u201cActually, on the way here, I remembered the nustlelack corpses, you know. I brought a few to study the undead.\u201d\u201cAh, I see! Summoning aspirants are extraordinary after all!\u201dCamibarez seemed to believe it without a doubt. Then, Meilyn angrily shouted from afar,\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Stop playing around and help us out!\u201d\u201cOkay~\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dEveryone was preparing to make a fire.Rick was laying straw on the ground and stacking up the firewood, and Meilyn was groaning and moving the firewood she had taken from the back of the hut.\u201cRick! Where do I put th\u2014 Wah!\u201dAs she was walking while looking forward, she staggered all of a sudden and lost her balance.\u201cYou alright?\u201dSimon approached her like lightning and grabbed the firewood.\u201cI\u2019ll move these.\u201dThen he lifted the firewood she was struggling with and carried it on his shoulder.\u201cYou can help with other things.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026? Uh\u2026 Thank you.\u201dMeilyn twisted her hair in embarrassment and turned around.Simon put down the firewood near Rick. He thought they\u2019d need more firewood, so he went back to the back of the hut.\u2018Oh no.\u2019All the cut firewood ran out. However, there was a chopping axe and a tree stump next to him.Simon took a thick piece of wood, put it on the stump, and raised his axe.Slice!The firewood was cleanly split in half.\u2018Good, good. I still got it.\u2019As Simon was feeling proud of himself while wielding the axe, Camibarez was suddenly staring at him from the side.She quickly picked up a new piece of firewood and placed it on the stump.\u201cI\u2019ll help you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, thanks. It\u2019s dangerous, so step back.\u201dCamibarez backed off, and Simon raised his axe. The axe could be heard cutting through the air before splitting the firewood in two.She clapped her hands.\u201cYou\u2019re so good! Did you do this often?\u201d\u201cYeah. This was one of my main jobs before I came to Kizen.\u201dSaid Simon as he wiped the sweat off his forehead.While Camibarez was bringing the next piece of firewood, Simon looked at the cross-section of the firewood.\u2018It\u2019s not split cleanly.\u2019Perhaps I placed more strength since someone was watching.As Simon was making a wry smile, Camibarez placed a new log and stepped back, waiting with shining eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s just wood chopping. Is it that fun?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAnd just like that, with the help of Camibarez, he acquired a lot of firewood, held it in his arms, and headed to the bonfire.\u201cYou made it bigger than I expected. Huh.\u201dSimon was amazed at the high pile of firewood. Rick giggled and pointed at the corpse of the nustlelack.\u201cThe nustlelack we hunted is huge. We need to make it at least this big.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dSimon went to also help make the fire.He laid straw, dry leaves, and twigs on the ground and stacked firewood on top of it into a pyramid. Now, as he ignited the kindling and fanned it, little by little, the flames moved to the firewood above.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201dMeilyn squatted nearby and rested her face in her hands.\u201cIs it really necessary to stack firewood like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that necessary, but this is the most common way to do it.\u201dAfter starting the fire, Simon slowly explained the fundamentals of bonfires. Rick, who was fanning it next to him, giggled.\u201cHow can someone who controls fire not even know how to make a bonfire?\u201d\u201cAh, shut up. Do you think that this fire and the fire I use are the same?\u201d\u201cWell, your personality is like a fire.\u201d\u201cAnd your mouth is like firewood. It\u2019d burn well if I split it in half and put it on the bonfire.\u201d\u201cOww, how brutal.\u201dThe fire quickly became stable as he waited while listening to Rick and Meilyn fight like usual.Simon brought over appropriately sized stones using a skeleton and laid them out in a circle near the bonfire.Now it looked somewhat nice.\u201cIs everyone here?\u201dEveryone jumped up from their seats at the sound of a voice behind them.\u201cProfessor Hong Feng!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201dShe was carrying various tools on her back barefoot and had a bucket in her hand with some fish.\u201cOh! Good job on making the fire. Shall we start right away?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe survival class started immediately.She placed the nustlelack the group hunted onto a wooden chopping board.\u201cThere are many different types of monsters, but the procedures in preparing them are almost the same, so please take a look.\u201dHer hands were feisty. She scraped off the fur with her knife, ripped its belly open, removed the intestines, and drained the blood.In the end, Camibarez couldn\u2019t take it and covered her eyes during the part where she removed the insides.\u201cThey usually say monster meat often has this foul smell, right? This stench comes from the decay of the meat and blood. To get rid of this, it\u2019s better to complete the preparation as soon as possible. Like this!\u201dAfter finishing the butchering class like that, the edible-looking pieces of meat were placed aside.Hong Feng said with a smile,\u201cJust like that. Pretty easy, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn and Camibarez nodded their heads with forced smiles.\u201cOkay then, next!\u201dThis time she demonstrated preparing fish. This one was a much easier job.\u201cThere are rivers and fish wherever you go, right? Fishing is also a great way to get food.\u201dHong Feng slashed off the fish head, removed the scales, then removed the insides and washed it with water.Soon after entering her hands, the fish was ready to be grilled.\u201cNow, let\u2019s grill it.\u201d\u201cHere comes the grill!\u201dRick took a grill and fixed it on the bonfire, and Hong Feng placed the nustlelack meat on it. As the meat began to cook, the juices began to drip.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. When prepared, it just looks just like pork.\u201d\u201cIt looks delicious!\u201dWhile grilling the meat, Hong Feng brought a few casks of spices and sprinkled them on top.\u201cI\u2019m sure this many spices can be brought in.\u201dAs she sprinkled the spices that looked like a mixture of peppers and seeds on the meat, a fragrance spread all over the place.\u201cAnd inevitably, the monster meat may contain parasites or bacteria. It\u2019s important to grill it on a strong fire.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter a while, the meat was cooked and transferred to a plate.Rick rolled over an oak barrel of wine, and Camibarez brought the tableware. Everything was ready.\u201cCheers!\u201dIn the end, it was an outdoor barbecue party disguised as a survival class. Everyone enjoyed eating and drinking in this lively atmosphere.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious!\u201dCamibarez covered her cheek with an ecstatic expression. Rick nodded as well.\u201cWoah, I\u2019m speechless. Totally. How can that disgusting bastard taste like this?\u201d\u201cHey! Could you not remind me of that when I\u2019m eating something so delicious?\u201dMeilyn rolled her eyes and scolded Rick.\u201cAh, Simon!\u201dHong Feng looked at Simon.\u201cWhere did Brett go? I was going to tell him to taste some of the meat since he helped me with the teleport and all.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSimon felt a guilty conscience, but answered back with a smile,\u201cI also told him, but he said he\u2019d go back ahead since he doesn\u2019t feel well today.\u201d\u201cMm~ Then I guess there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201dIt was getting dark, and the feast was coming to a head. The bonfire was so big that it felt like a campfire.Most of all, it took a short time to adjust, since the members were the same as the last time they had a drink. Today, even Camibarez, who was afraid of alcohol, drank well.\u201cAh, that\u2019s the stuff~\u201dRick shook his head while giving off a smell of wine.Rick liked alcohol, but he wasn\u2019t a heavy drinker.\u201cRick, you alright?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah. I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Ima just take a piss real quick.\u201dRick stood up from his seat and walked away, showing his back. He seemed quite intoxicated, as his gait was unsettling.Then he stopped in a nearby grassy field and started taking his pants off. Seeing this, Meilyn screamed in fright.\u201cUwaaah! Aghh! You crazy bastard! Do it somewhere further!\u201dDribble sounds were heard after a while. Meilyn, disgusted, hurriedly covered her ears and turned her head.\u201cGosh! Commoners\u2026\u2026! Such disgrace!\u201dSimon and Hong Feng laughed as she screamed.At that moment, someone rested their head on Simon\u2019s forearm.\u201c\u2026\u2026Cami?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Camibarez, whose cheeks were blushing after drinking, leaned on Simon\u2019s arm and fell asleep.\u201cUuuuuumm\u2026\u2026 Simoooon\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cProfessor. I\u2019ll take her to the hut and let her sleep.\u201d\u201cYes. Please do.\u201dHong Feng lifted the glass.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have a toast with Meilyn!\u201d\u201cP-Professor, you seem to be drinking too much tod\u2014\u201d\u201cMe too! I wanna toast with you too!\u201dRick came running, making Meilyn run to the side in horror.\u201cAgh! You crazy bastard! Zip up your pants! Your pants!\u201dWhen Simon was about to get up after laughing, Camibarez pulled at Simon\u2019s clothes all of a sudden.\u201cCami?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t leave me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201dReassured Simon, and he gently lifted her up in his arms.She snuggled into Simon\u2019s arms and rubbed her face against his chest.\u201cHey, hey, Simon.\u201dMeilyn blearily opened her eyes.\u201cIf you do something strange to Cami, I\u2019ll kill you. Alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you saying?\u201d\u201cJust put her to bed and come out quickly!\u201dSimon entered Hong Feng\u2019s hut while carrying Camibarez.She was sleeping like a log. As Simon slowly placed her on the bed, she lay in a comfortable position, curling up as though she was waiting for that.\u201cGood night, Cami.\u201dSimon stroked her hair and covered her with a blanket. The moment he turned his back and headed towards the door\u2026Grab!Suddenly, something caught onto the nape of Simon\u2019s shirt. Simon got pulled with incredible force and fell onto the bed as Camibarez opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dCamibarez now seemed like a completely different person. Simon\u2019s face turned pale at the pressure radiating from her.The moment her sharp fangs were about to head toward Simon\u2019s neck\u2026Tap!She quickly covered her mouth with her hands and pressed her forehead against Simon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cNo\u2026 Simon is\u2026 Zzzz.\u201dThen she fell asleep again.Simon was so startled that he was dripping sweat.Her face was so calm that it was hard to tell if what had just happened was a drunken hallucination or reality.\u2018Cami\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you\u2026 held it back for me.\u2019\u201cMmmmmm.\u201dSimon laid her straight on the bed and covered her with a blanket. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but somehow, he felt grateful.Simon sighed in relief and smiled softly.\u201cGoodnight, Cami.\u201d* * *Midterm exams had ended, and a new week began.\u201cI have an important announcement today.\u201dSaid the professor in charge of Class A, Jane, while looking around at the students.Now this pattern was quite familiar. The students girded their loins and waited for her next words. Jane took the official announcement from her assistant and read it.\u201cYes, in two days, you\u2019ll be doing an Island Survival Assessment.\u201dFinally, Kizen officially announced it.Island Survival, also known as the Island Survival Assessment. A large-scale program involving all the first-year students.The students made a clamor as though a bomb had exploded, but Simon and Group 7 all looked at each other with meaningful smiles.\u2018Oh, how can I wait two days?\u2019Simon crossed his arms as the corners of his lips rose so high, they were about to ascend.\u201cPlease just take one book per person!\u201dThe assistant teachers went around quickly and distributed the performance assessment guidebook to the students.\u201cI\u2019ll explain it briefly.\u201dSaid Jane as she opened the guidebook.The students followed along and opened the book.\u201cFrom Class A to Class N, all 961 first-year students who have survived so far will fall to the island through teleportation.\u201dJane grabbed chalk and drew a circle that was perhaps supposed to be an island. A triangle was marked in the center of the island, and then dots were tapped on the outermost part of the island\u2019s edge.\u201cYou will start at a random location on the island\u2019s outskirts. The rule that runs through the core of this project is simple. Survive for four days.\u201dThe students nodded nervously.\u201cHowever, simply surviving alone wouldn\u2019t be able to properly assess students\u2019 abilities. This assessment has a point system. After all of the tests are over, your grades and rank will be different depending on your points.\u201dShe placed small Xs over the island.\u201cYou can earn points by hunting monsters that appear all over the island. From the weakest 1st-grade monsters up to 4th-grade monsters. Depending on the type of monster, you can get from 1 point to over 20 points.\u201dThen, Jamie Victoria raised her hand.\u201cThat\u2019s probably a question of how points will be counted, isn\u2019t it, Jamie Victoria.\u201dJamie blushed and lowered her hand. You could hear small laughs breaking out.\u201cWe\u2019ll use this equipment.\u201dJane waved her bracelet. It had a round and wide body that looked like the mouth of a monster and had a string attached to it.\u201cIt\u2019s a biological artifact called a tongue pad. If you bring this artifact close to a monster that has stopped breathing\u2026\u201dThump!The students screamed in surprise when the long tongue spurted out of the mouth-shaped bracelet. The long tongue skimmed through the training materials the assistant teachers had prepared in advance and then went back into the bracelet.\u201cThis artifact will absorb the corpse\u2019s mana and process it. Then, within 10 seconds, the pad will display the number in mana language.\u201dSaid Jane as she showed the number on the tongue pad go up.\u201cSo, hunting monsters isn\u2019t an option, but a necessity. At least for meals.\u201dAt those words, you could see some students\u2019 faces stiffening quickly.Afterward, Jane gave detailed instructions on how to use the tongue pad. In addition to simply absorbing the mana of the hunted monsters and turning them into points, you could also transfer the accumulated points to someone else\u2019s tongue pad.\u201cGoing back to the rules, battles between Kizen students are, of course, possible. If you make the other student\u2019s barrier gauge hit 0, that student will be determined as \u2018dead\u2019. The assessment will be over for them, and they\u2019ll be teleported to a safe area. At this time, the tongue pad of the student going to the safe area will spit out all the mana it had in a chunk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIn other words, if you hunted down another student, you could extort that student and increase your points significantly.Jane didn\u2019t really explain it in detail, but everyone knew that this was the key point.\u201cAnd one more important tip is that\u2026\u201dShe pointed to the center of the island with the chalk.\u201cIn the center of the island, there\u2019s a mansion that Kizen built. It\u2019s an indestructible mansion, impervious to any means of attack. The inside of the mansion is the only safe zone on the whole island, and if you set foot in there even once\u2026\u201dShe turned to the students.\u201cAfter the assessment is over, 200 points will be given.\u201dThe clamors of the students suddenly grew tremendously.\u201cAll of you guys will start on the outskirts of the island, but you have to move towards the center of the island. After all, the difference between going to the mansion and not is huge.\u201dSimon, who was listening to the explanation, also nodded. You could reach the middle rank if you could get 200 points.\u201cI\u2019m done explaining the important things.\u201dShe said as she put down the chalk and turned to the students.\u201cThis survival assessment comprehensively evaluates your survivability, combat ability, coping ability, and resilience when you fall into an unfamiliar place. The big rules are clear and simple, but there are many tricky, detailed rules. How you use these would be the skill. I hope that you\u2019ll fully understand the contents of the guidebook over the two days.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen, for the rest of the period\u2026\u201dJane looked at her wristwatch.The students\u2019 eyes shone. Perhaps some free time?\u201cWe\u2019ll conduct a class with an outside lecturer.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSimon\u2019s eyes widened. An outside lecturer? This was a first.\u201cPlease come in.\u201dJane gestured, and a middle-aged man came up to the stage.He had a good smile on his face and was wearing overalls with many pockets.\u201cIntroducing you to Hunter Edward Bulkbag.\u201dSaid Jane.\u201cHe may be unfamiliar to some of you, but he\u2019s a legend in his field and a top-notch treasure hunter with over tens of thousands of ancient ruins discovered.\u201dApplause poured out from everywhere. Rick in particular was beating the desk in excitement.\u201cInsane! Woah! Is this for real? Is it \u2018that\u2019 Treasure Hunter Edward? The level of Professor Jane\u2019s recruitment is out of this world\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs he a great person?\u201dWhen Meilyn asked that with a sour face, Rick turned around, shocked.\u201cHey! How could you not know Edward? Now this is a real lack of common knowledge!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.\u201d\u201cGaaaaaah!\u201dEdward opened his mouth with a nervous smile as he came up to the stage.\u201cAh, hm. Nice to meet you. You\u2019re first-year students at Kizen, am I right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLoudly answered the students.\u201cUhaha! To think that a day would come where I\u2019m giving a lecture at Kizen! Looks like I\u2019ve been successful, huh? In fact, it was all thanks to my father that I was able to be this successful. I was born in a poor environment, but\u2014\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dJane, who had her arms folded behind him, coughed a little. Edward flinched and straightened his back.\u201cAh, yes! Let\u2019s skip the idle talk and start right away! I\u2019m confident that there\u2019s no single place in the Dark Territory that I haven\u2019t been. Ah, to be precise, there\u2019s no place that I haven\u2019t explored across the continent. As well as the Holy Federation, I secretly\u2014\u201d\u201cHunter Edward.\u201d\u201cAh, ah! I\u2019m sorry, Vice President! Hahaha! To put it simply, I\u2019m a survival expert. I don\u2019t have as powerful dark magic as all of you, but the weak have their own way of surviving. It\u2019s called thorough preparation! Now, now.\u201dAfter speaking incoherently, Edward took out the materials he had prepared from his bag and stuck them on the blackboard.The types of monsters and vegetation appearing on the island were shown in pictures and tables.The assistant teachers walked around handing out copies of the materials to the students.\u201cThe place where you\u2019ll take the test is called \u2018Kera Island\u2019.\u201dSaid Edward after turning to the students.\u201cIt\u2019s an area prohibited by Kizen, but there are several other large and small islands besides Kera Island. I\u2019ve been to all these islands, and based on this, I was able to estimate the vegetation and the monsters in Kera Island.\u201dHe was very nervous about being in Kizen, and he checked on the countenance of Jane standing behind him. Still, when he started talking about his field, Edward appeared very professional.Plants you can and can\u2019t eat on Kera Island.Inedible and edible monsters, and exactly which parts can be eaten and how to cook them.Weather and climate, terrains to watch out for, low and high tides, behaviors that attract the attention of monsters, how to ward off wild snakes, and more.Even the nobles who were acting perverse, complaining about why she called over a person like him, were immersed and concentrating, leaning forward. This was only natural, seeing as it was survival knowledge that would come in handy two days later.The students frantically moved their quills and took notes.\u201cYep! My explanation ends here. Thank you for listening! Any questions?\u201dHands were raised from all over the room.While Edward was answering questions one by one, Simon was going through copies of his material.\u2018Hm?\u2019There was one particularly strange entity among the many monsters inhabiting the island. He didn\u2019t know why, but it caught his attention.It was a monster whose face was covered with something like a bandage.When Simon was staring at the monster, Pier\u2019s clone wriggled and moved.[Hey, Boy\u2026\u2026!]\u2018Oh, Pier. When did you arrive?\u201dThe eyes of Pier\u2019s clone widened.[That picture! Put it close in front of me!]Simon put the picture in front of his chest so Pier could see it properly.The clone\u2019s eyes shook frantically.[Unbelievable. No way! Why is this guy over there?]\u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d[Of course! This is an ancient undead who served as a captain of the Legion!]Simon\u2019s eyes widened. A captain appearing in this place?[Kuhehe. To think that I\u2019m seeing that face again.]Pier\u2019s clone muttered in a serious voice,[Boy! I\u2019m sure you remember the sin of the Legion.]\u2018Yes. Following my father\u2019s instruction to protect my mother, they betrayed the Dark Alliance and fought the Necromancers\u2026\u2026\u2019[Yeah. After fighting for a while, the Legion withdrew due to the large-scale offensive of the Alliance. There was a guy who sacrificed himself to defend against the attack and escaped us safely to sea.]\u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2019Simon\u2019s gaze turned to the monster\u2019s eyes again covered with bandages.[This guy\u2019s name is Bigkrum.]Pier\u2019s eyes became serious.[He\u2019s the captain of the giant troops.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Simon heard a detailed explanation from Pier.An ancient undead who sacrificed himself for the sake of the Legion. Pier said that he was extremely devoted and loyal to the Legion, unlike an undead.[I thought he must\u2019ve died then, but to think that he\u2019s alive. On an island owned by Kizen at that.]\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019Simon rubbed his chin and went into deep thought.Something was strange. His father\u2019s undead was in the place where he was heading for a performance assessment? The timing was just too right.But the bait was too big to completely ignore it.[It\u2019s not like there\u2019s no relation at all! If you go all the way toward the continent from the place called Kera Island, you\u2019ll find the port city Ballot. Since Bigkrum disappeared in the battle there\u2026]\u2018I understand. I\u2019d like to take him in seeing as he was my father\u2019s undead. Would that be alright?\u2019[Kuhehe! Of course! That guy is an important military strength. If you obtain him, he\u2019ll be a great help to you in the future.]\u2018Alright. Trying wouldn\u2019t hurt. Let\u2019s try to get in contact with him.\u2019In addition to taking the Island Survival Assessment like regular students, Simon added a new goal.A mission that may be more important than getting good grades.[However, since a considerable amount of time has passed, his personality or his mind may have changed.]Simon nodded his head. Elizabeth was also uncooperative with the Legion at first.[So take me too! I\u2019ll have to persuade him myself.]\u201cMm.\u201dSimon turned the pages of the guidebook with a troubled expression.\u2018If you look at this, apparently all the subspaces of the students are inspected right before the teleportation. It\u2019s forbidden to bring in unnecessary items or food, so\u2026\u2026\u2019[Subspace inspection? That\u2019s annoying.]\u2018I\u2019ll try to come up with a solution. I\u2019ll have to stop by the ruins this evening and talk to Eliza.\u2019Then the bell rang, announcing the end of the lecture. Jane clapped her hands and came back up to the stage.\u201cToday\u2019s lecture ends here. Please prepare thoroughly for two days. It\u2019d be good to familiarize yourself with the detailed rules and the operation of the tongue pad in advance. Let\u2019s end now.\u201d\u201cThank you for the lecture!\u201dThe students rushed out of the classroom like a tide.Some students, including Rick, seemed to want to talk to Edward and get an autograph, but they turned away after a look from Jane.\u201cSimon, what are you doing? Let\u2019s go eat already.\u201dSimon replied with a smile at Rick\u2019s words,\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you eat with Meilyn and the others today? I have some personal business.\u201d\u201c?\u201d* * *\u201c3 minutes and 21 seconds left for your meal.\u201dEdward thought that this woman, the vice-president of Kizen, was scarier than any monsters or traps he had ever encountered.After shoving the food in his mouth without knowing how it tasted, Edward walked out of the restaurant and followed Jane\u2019s guide to the teleport magic circle.In fact, it was more like being pulled off rather than guided.\u201cV-Vice President.\u201dEdward gave a forced smile.He decided to give it a chance. I mean, she wouldn\u2019t turn a person into a skeleton just because they mentioned it, right?\u201cFive hours! No, just two hours, please! A so-called professional treasure hunter has come to the mysterious Roke Island. I can\u2019t just go back like th\u2014!\u201dJane looked at her wristwatch with a blank expression on her face.\u201cPeople who don\u2019t have formal permission to enter Roke Island can\u2019t enter Kizen. You have 6 minutes and 23 seconds left for your permission, Hunter Edward.\u201dEdward was sweating profusely.How could a person be so single-minded\u2026\u2026?! But he couldn\u2019t give up like this.\u201cTh-Then, it\u2019d be alright if we extend that permitted time a little bit more! A-A while ago, a professor named Bahil asked me to hold a lecture for Class B\u2026\u2026\u201dIn that moment\u2026Fires lit up in Jane\u2019s eyes.Edward, realizing he had made a mistake, shut his mouth, but it was already too late.She gestured to the assistant teacher following Jane.\u201cTell professor Bahil to come to my lab right now.\u201dThe assistant teacher tensely said,\u201cUh, with what reason shall I call h\u2014\u201d\u201cTell him I\u2019m going to him if he doesn\u2019t shut up and come running to me within 10 minutes.\u201dAt that, the assistant started running frantically.The corner of Edward\u2019s smile started to twitch.\u2018I don\u2019t care about adventures anymore. I just want to get off this island in one piece.\u2019Just like that, after walking for a few more minutes, they arrived in front of the teleport magic circle returning to the continent.\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is that?\u201dBut the trouble wasn\u2019t over yet.When she heard the report of the teleport manager, who approached her with a troubled expression, Jane began to blaze up.The manager bowed repeatedly as though he had committed a deadly sin.\u201cThe teleport magic circle is overloaded due to the preparation for island survival? What kind of ridiculous excuse is that?\u201d\u201cW-We\u2019ll get things fixed!\u201d\u201cPlease assemble the entire teleport team into my lab by 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201dJane let out a deep sigh and walked over to Edward. She then closed her eyes and bowed her head.\u201cIt seems your return will be delayed by about 10 minutes due to an internal construction problem, Hunter. On behalf of Kizen, I apologize to you.\u201d\u201cA-Ahahaha\u2026 I-I\u2019m fine! It\u2019s really, really fine!\u201dI mean, why did she scold people that much for just delaying the return of an outsider by 10 minutes?\u201cI\u2019ll have to check the magic circle myself. You, please stay still and wait, Hunter.\u201dAt her words, Edward felt as though his whole body was frozen.\u2018Is this the curse that I\u2019ve only heard of?\u2019\u201cI-I understand! Please, take your time! Haha!\u201dJane went to see the teleport magic circle.Edward, left alone, sighed in relief. As he was squatting down because his legs somehow felt like jelly\u2026\u201cHello!\u201dSomebody spoke to him. When he turned his head, a male student in a Kizen uniform looked down at him with a smile.\u201cOh! You\u2019re\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Class A student who took your class, Hunter. It was a really good class.\u201dEdward jumped up, feeling his self-esteem quickly restored. He then flicked out paper and a pen from his clothes.\u201cFufu, great. What\u2019s your name again?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here to get autographs. I\u2019m here because I have something to ask you about the contents of your class.\u201dEdward lowered his pen with a sullen face.Why were the students and professors of this school so rigid?\u201cThis monster listed in your material, Hunter.\u201dSimon continued while presenting the picture of Bigkrum.\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201dEdward grabbed the picture before looking around at it.\u201cHmm\u2026 So there was a picture of this monster. I didn\u2019t check it separately because It was all printed out collectively.\u201d\u201cI pictured it because it looked interesting at that time, but I don\u2019t know what kind of monster it is. I\u2019ve been in this field for almost 30 years, and this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a monster like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you mean by interesting?\u201dEdward blearily opened his eyes and said,\u201cIt was foggy that day, so I don\u2019t know if I saw it correctly, but suddenly this monster became colossal in size as it wandered around the island. When I rushed out the mana camera, its size shrunk back.\u201dSimon gulped.\u201cHow big did it become?\u201dAs though recalling that moment, Edward\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cBig enough to cover the entire island.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78The Kizen Training Center.Phewwwwww.A man was lifting a heavy dumbbell until late in the evening. His upper body and arm muscles expanded and contracted repeatedly as he raised a black dumbbell.A male student who was making a lame attempt with the dumbbells next to him glanced at him and said,\u201cH-Hector.\u201dClannngggg!A large barbell fell, and a loud sound resounded from the floor. The student flinched and hunched over slightly.\u201cPhewww\u2026\u201dHector wiped his sweat off with the towel around his neck. The black light that fluttered in the barbell disappeared and returned the barbell to its original, iron form.\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Right! They\u2019ve all come together and gathered themselves up nearby in the next building from here.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to speak at length. Just deliver my words.\u201dCrack. Crack.When Hector touched his neck, a bloody sound echoed.\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely hunt down Simon Polentia in this Island Survival Assessment.\u201dA fire lit up in Hector\u2019s eyes.Finally, a chance to defeat Simon came. There was no need to wait to be paired up against him in the Duel Evaluation.\u201cAs you all probably realized from the Cyclops assessment, as long as he remains conscious, we can never dominate Class A or achieve the best grades in the class.\u201d\u201cR-Right.\u201d\u201cClass A is a class that Kizen\u2019s vice president is in charge of directly. Taking control of this class is more important than anything else.\u201dThe student listening had a bitter grin inside.Removing political rivals or competitors in Kizen was a natural and frequent occurrence. It was a goal that both factions and allies could understand.But the way Hector dealt with Simon felt like something more than the removal of a political rival.The student wondered why Hector was so obsessed with restraining Simon. Maybe there was some kind of ill-fated relationship between the Moore and the Polentia family.\u201cIf you got it, go.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah!\u201dWhen Hector lifted the huge barbell again, it was dyed black. He was training both physical and jet-black operations at the same time.\u201cHuufff!\u201dSweat dripped down Hector\u2019s body.He looked full of spite.* * *The outskirts of Kizen.There stood an old, dusty, abandoned building that had been left unattended for years. It looked like it was going to collapse at any moment. Moonlight leaked through a hole in its ceiling, and a flickering light bulb added to the creepy atmosphere.A male student walked in, picking off cobwebs from his clothes with annoyance. It was none other than Haren Cork, who lost against the Duel Evaluation with Simon.He looked around as he arrived at the meeting point. It seemed that the person who called him hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\u2018I hope this isn\u2019t a waste of time.\u2019Haren shoved the crumpled letter in his hand into his pocket before closing his eyes and crossing his arms.\u2018\u2026\u2026Simon Polentia.\u2019Still, he couldn\u2019t forget what Simon said at the end.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of reason you got for hating me, but\u2026 you can never defeat me with such a power when it isn\u2019t yours.\u201dClench!His blood boiled thinking about how Simon talked as though he knew everything.Simon knew, or guessed to some extent, that he had been operated on by Bahil.It was dangerous. Haren didn\u2019t know why Simon didn\u2019t bring it up to Kizen and make it an issue, but as long as he knew Haren\u2019s secret, Haren needed to get rid of him quickly.Haren clenched his fist.\u2018This power\u2026\u2026\u2019Although Simon defeated him, his power was true, no matter what.In the Duel Evaluation last week, he beat a student who was evaluated as superior in every way and got promoted to the middle squad.Because of this, Haren Cork was recognized by his classmates, and recently he had been hanging out with some popular students.His self-esteem was going up drastically day by day.\u2018But\u2026\u2019He felt his strength draining away little by little. Bahil said that his power lasted for at most two months.\u2018I have to be in Professor Bahil\u2019s favor again, no matter what.\u2019The only way was to become a direct disciple of Bahil. In order to do that, it was necessary to complete the mission that he failed last time.This time, I\u2019ll defeat Simon and prove my worth to Bahil.\u201cI-Is someone there?\u201dThen, he heard the voice of an unfamiliar female student in the abandoned building. Haren said,\u201cI\u2019m alone. Who are you?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dA female student stuck his head out and came in after feeling relieved to see Haren\u2019s uniform.\u201cDid you also come here with that letter?\u201d\u201cYou too?\u201dShe nodded her head.\u201cMy name is Jessica Cananore, Class H.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Haren Cork from Class G. Do you also have a grudge against Simon?\u201dShe slightly avoided Haren\u2019s gaze.\u201cN-No. I received an apology, so it\u2019s not necessarily a grudge\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201d\u201cNothing, just\u2026\u2026\u201dJessica realized a lot of things after the duel with Simon.She felt like she was dealing with a monster that was far above her, a cut from a different cloth. Looking back on that time, there was a strange sense of inspiration.She wanted to become like that. She wanted to become stronger.At that moment, the sound of footsteps clearly echoed throughout the abandoned building.Clanngg ClannggHaren and Jessica looked around nervously and Haren shouted,\u201cWho\u2019s that?!\u201dThen, the footsteps stopped. When the two of them were raising the jet-black from their cores in case of emergency.Whaaaaaaaap.The moonlight poured down from the ceiling of the abandoned building, making the two frown as they quickly covered their eyes.Somebody came down from the sky.They were wearing a black robe that covered their entire body, and a hood was pressed down to the bottom of their head, so you couldn\u2019t tell who they were.Since they were floating in the air, it was difficult to figure out their physique, age, and gender.But you could feel a very foreign kind of power.\u201cWh-Who are you\u2026\u2026?\u201dJessica scanned them over a few times, frightened.Looks like this was the person who sent the letter.Instead of answering, they slowly moved their hand.Flap!\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dLarge wings spread out behind their robe. As they slowly lifted the hood with their fingertips, they spoke.Looking at the figure behind the hood, Haren\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cY-You are\u2026\u2026!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *The day of the Island Survival.Having a huge event ahead, the Kizen students talked in excitement, faces flushed.A total of 14 large teleport circles were being prepared, and Class A was stood on one of them.A huge magic circle was drawn in the center, and small magic circles spread like leaves around it. The students were standing on top of a small magic circle.\u201cI-I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201dSaid Camibarez as her shoulders shuddered.\u201cWhat if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s split from the group?\u201d\u201cThe location doesn\u2019t matter, Cami. I heard that we\u2019ll be teleported completely at random.\u201dSaid Simon while giving off a kind smile.\u201cIf you\u2019re nervous, wanna swap places with me?\u201d\u201cN-No! It\u2019s fine!\u201d\u201cBy the way, girls\u2026\u201dRick, leaning back into his hands cupped behind his head, asked,\u201cAre you guys really going to skin monsters and eat them?\u201d\u201cI-I just ended up practicing fishing. Hehe\u2026\u2026\u201dSaid Camibarez with a forced smile. Meilyn also sighed lightly.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to eat monsters or else I\u2019ll become really hungry, as I learned, but I\u2019ll try my best to get as many of the supplies as possible.\u201dSupplies were one of the features in Island Survival. During the assessment, a large magic circle would occasionally appear in the sky, and exactly 1 minute later, supplies would drop down from the magic circle.It\u2019s said that the supplies included food and special artifacts that could only be used in the assessment.Competition was bound to be quite fierce. It could be safe to assume that all the students in the vicinity would be aiming for the supplies.\u201cNow, please prepare yourselves!\u201dThen, the servants ran around and spread the word.\u201cWe will now commence teleportation to the island!\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t step outside the magic circle!\u201dThe students waited with nervous faces as they brought their legs inside the magic circle.While Simon was excitedly waiting with his arms crossed, he saw Hector staring at him from afar.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll be having a big fight again if I meet him.\u2019He didn\u2019t know what he did for Hector to always try to get him, but Simon thought that it could be a good way to deal with him, using this as a chance if he had no choice but to go against him someday.Whirrrr!Whirr!Light then came off the magic circles, causing cheers and screams from everywhere to break loose .\u201cE-Everyone, let\u2019s do our best!\u201dExclaimed Camibarez as she screwed her eyes shut.\u201cHehe. Everyone, stay safe and I\u2019ll see you all again in Kizen!\u201d\u201cI told you guys, okay? Don\u2019t die while trying to get to the center of the island! Just avoid getting the lowest points!\u201dWhirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!Meilyn\u2019s voice, nagging till the end, dispersed, and the magic circle\u2019s light became stronger and stronger.Simon\u2019s vision became blurry, and he felt his legs start to float.* * *The world that was full of light for a while began to gradually take shape.Simon felt the wind tickling his body, his sense of touch returning earlier than his sense of sight. Simon didn\u2019t overdo it and waited for his vision to return, then looked around.\u201c\u2026\u2026Woah.\u201dHe really fell into the middle of the jungle.Everywhere was green. It was his first time seeing a place with such a thick and dense population of plants.The plants ranged from tropical ones with large leaves, to indiscriminately growing vines that covered trees. Moreover, the climate was very hot and humid, the air was heavy, and the soil was moist, perhaps from the rain.\u201cSo I have to survive here for four days?\u201dSimon\u2019s body trembled.A strange tension rose up through his spine and spread throughout his body before his previously contained emotions burst forth.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be so fun!!\u201dWith Simon\u2019s shout, some birds got startled and flew away. Pier\u2019s clone hanging on Simon\u2019s school uniform also woke up and looked at Simon.[Looks like you have arrived. But why are you so excited?]\u201cBecause adventure is calling me.\u201d[\u2026\u2026Crazy bastard. Don\u2019t tell me you forgot our goal.]Simon grinned.\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t. We have to find Big Krum, the captain of the giant troops, faster than anyone else, right?\u201dWhile saying that, Simon lifted his leg and stepped hard on the ground.A small\u00a0squeak\u00a0came from something as it burst.\u201cAlright.\u201dSimon bent down and lifted it up.[Urk! What\u2019s that nasty thing?!]Simon replied with a smile,\u201cIt\u2019s my snack for today.\u201dA large snake with a reticulate pattern drooped down. This got Simon excited and he put the dead snake into his subspace.\u201cTo be able to obtain a snack this easily. We\u2019re starting off well!\u201d[\u2026\u2026Boy, you seem to be a lot more excited than usual.]\u201cYeah.\u201dSimon looked around the surrounding jungle once and smiled.\u201cAfter all, this is my stage, no matter what anyone else says.\u201dA crazy survival expert from Les Hill had entered Kera Island.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79The teleportation of the 961 first-year Kizen students had finished.And at the same time, the Island Survival began.\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaaah! Bugs! Bugs! Bugs!\u201d\u201cWhy the fuck are you poking the beehive, you crazy bastards!\u201d\u201cAre you not supposed to eat this? Why am I getting rashes on my arms?\u201dAll hell broke loose.70% of first-year students were from prestigious noble families. They were overly-sheltered people who didn\u2019t do well in their house gardens, let alone islands or jungles.Such people fell on an island with a tropical rainforest climate. It was natural for there to be wide-spread panic.Everyone must\u2019ve come fully prepared in their hearts.Prepared to sleep in the wild. Prepared to not be able to wash up. Prepared to eat monster meat.However\u2026\u201cSnake! It\u2019s a snake!\u201d\u201cI got bitten by a bug!\u201d\u201cThe mushroom is moving!\u201dWhen they fell into the jungle, everything was beyond their imagination.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sigh.\u201dIt had already been 30 minutes since the survival assessment began. Meilyn stood up with a stiff expression on her face.She thought things were a little better for her than the other students. Thanks to Rick, she could attain this information earlier, and she learned survival skills from Hong Feng over the weekend. And these survival skills\u2026Sshhk.As she plucked up her courage and stepped forward, swarms of ants streamed out to where she stepped.\u201cUwah!\u201dShe backed off, terrified. When the ants appeared, centipedes with dozens of feet jumped out and began to suck at the ants.Meilyn\u2019s body hardened like stone.\u2018\u2026\u2026I-I really can\u2019t move even a single step.\u2019The psychological limitations resulting from the environment in which they grew up were unavoidable. It took her around 5 seconds to realize that, when she backed off into a tree, a red ant crawled onto her shoulder.\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dThe other students were also in the same, grim situation.Of course, it wasn\u2019t like they didn\u2019t prepare. Island Survival was a well-known, annual event in Kizen, and the students thought that the core of this assessment was monster hunting and battle between Kizen students, so they only raised their fighting abilities. However\u2026It didn\u2019t take long for them to realize that that was a mistake.In these unfavorable situations, every student took the same action.\u201cLet\u2019s work together!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll work together till the end!\u201dHerd instincts. Standing together when afraid to be by yourself.And there was little fear of being betrayed, since everyone started with 0 points in the beginning.Through this, several students got together to form groups and started to come up with solutions using their collective intelligence. This was especially true if there was at least one commoner among the group. They were the best leaders in this situation.\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you guys all doing?\u201dLorenna, a commoner in Class B, was looking at them pathetically with her hand on her hip.Behind her, grown noble men were hugging each other and clinging to a tree. An earthworm was wriggling about and passing by in front of them.\u201cG-Get rid of that right now!\u201d\u201cNanny! Nanny!\u201dYoung masters looking for their nanny appeared one after another.The unfamiliar environment, hot and humid weather, and the threat of disgusting insects and monsters. They all became hungry quickly, maintaining their condition in the worst situations.As though Kizen was aware of this fact, they had already started distributing supplies. A magic circle spread in the sky, and supplies began to fall from it.\u201cOver there!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe students who saw the magic circle all rushed towards it.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026 We\u2019re here!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re the first\u2014!\u201dThe moment they climbed through the thick bushes to the open hill\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u2026more than 20 students could be seen eyeing each other up while waiting for the supplies to come down.\u2018What\u2019s this?!\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Such keen competition.\u2019\u201cEveryone, get lost.\u201dIt was then. An unusually large student was walking up the hill.\u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna die, that is.\u201dHector Moore of Class A.As he appeared, some students backed off hesitantly.Then, a male student leaning against the rock scoffed.\u201cBastard, fucking high off yourself. Are you the young master of the Moore family?\u201dA skinny man. His yellow-colored hair covered his left eye, and he was holding a long rod of uncertain use in his hand.Hector frowned.\u201cSpecial Admission No.10 Malcolm Randolf.\u201d\u201cAh, give me a break. It\u2019s been over a month since the school started, and you\u2019re still on that special admission bullshit?\u201d\u201cYou sure do talk a lot for an insect who rode the last bus.\u201dMalcolm\u2019s eyebrow twitched.There are only 10 special admissions. Among them, number 10, the last member of them, was ridiculed by the students with slang such as \u2018getting on the last bus\u2019 or \u2018last bus boarder\u2019.Of course, there was almost no one who called him to his face, though.\u201cYou\u2019re Class A, aren\u2019t you?\u201dMalcolm got up while spitting on the floor.\u201cLooks like that \u2018No.1\u2019 in your class isn\u2019t really managing his mates, huh?\u201dThis time, Hector\u2019s eyebrow twitched.\u201cFuck the supplies or whatever. I\u2019ll have to beat the shit out of you first.\u201d\u201cOh my, how scary~ Try me if you can.\u201dThe two activated their cores and rushed toward each other. At the start of the survival, these clashed, and a roar resounded throughout the island.This wasn\u2019t the only battle either. There were many fights over supplies, all happening at the same time.The artifacts that were randomly placed within the supplies were also necessary, but the most important part was food.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Do I really have to grill the monsters?\u201dHowever, while most of the students were in chaos for this first day\u2026There was a boy who stood out.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Drag drag drag.On one shoulder, he had vines, wood, herbs, and fruits. On his other hand, he was holding a monster\u2019s leg and dragging it.His face was smeared with mashed fennel to prevent insect bites, and he wore boots on his legs.\u2018I-Is he native or something?\u2019\u2018What a shocking sight.\u2019When the students saw him, they all looked surprised. He looked perfectly localized, despite it only being a few hours since they arrived.\u2018I heard that there\u2019s nothing to eat here.\u2019Simon smiled delightfully while putting the ingredients into the subspace.\u2018But there\u2019s plenty! It\u2019s like a paradise of food!\u2019Simon was wandering in all directions, taking all the fruits, herbs, edible animals and monsters, strong branches, and materials.\u2018Maybe he\u2019s familiar with the jungle?\u2019\u2018Was he once a treasure hunter?\u2019The current appearance of Simon was enough to even bring out a sensation of envy hidden beneath the surface for many students.Some students approached Simon and asked,\u201cHey, would you like to join our team? We can take responsibility for combat.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s fine, could you please come with u\u2014\u201dSimon shook his head with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I plan to spend the first day by myself.\u201dAfter soundly rejecting all offers, Simon took the axe in his hand and swung at the large plant in front of him.Crack!Then, the body of the plant split, and a sugary fruit came out. Simon took it and moved on.Some students approached the fruit-bearing plant when they saw Simon do it. When one tapped the plant\u2019s body, the leaves suddenly split like an insectivorous plant and swallowed the student whole.\u201cIsn\u2019t that how you do it?\u201d\u201cAgghh! You crazy bastard! Don\u2019t just watch and do something!\u201dPeople just got into trouble by following him.Even after that, Simon\u2019s movements were feisty. He was walking along with his skeletons, sweeping away all the useful materials on the island.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t expect to get this here.\u201dSimon picked up a lot of floating plants from the stream. It was a plant called water hyacinth, which could survive even a human treading on it as long as it was in the water.In addition to that, he also got wild coconuts with high sugar content that contained a lot of water, as well as some sorghum that could be used as a spice.And above all, the strangest thing about Simon\u2019s movement was that, while the vast majority of students were advancing toward the center of the island, Simon was walking toward the sea.He was going in the complete opposite direction.[Hey Boy.]Pier also questioned this point.[Your will to search Big Krum is admirable, but wouldn\u2019t this put you too far from the center?]\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dSimon chuckled.\u201cI\u2019ll catch up to them all tomorrow.\u201d[\u2026\u2026?]Perhaps because he was proceeding in the opposite direction to the other students, the crowds became rarer, and the traces of the students started disappearing. On the other hand, monster attacks became more frequent.Of course\u2026Pow!Crack!The monsters on the island were no match for Simon\u2019s summons.Currently, Simon could control four undead units at once thanks to training with Pier.\u2018It\u2019s a level 2 monster \u2018wrecker\u2019 this time.\u2019A six-legged monster with a long snout, reminiscent of a leopard, was running toward Simon.When Simon stretched out his finger, a skeleton with a shield ran out and collided with it.\u201cLeg.\u201dAnd a skeleton holding a spear thrust it over the shield into a leg, limiting the wrecker\u2019s mobility.\u201cArrow.\u201dA skeleton archer\u2019s arrow stuck in the monster\u2019s eye.Blood dripped from its eyes, obscuring the wrecker\u2019s vision.\u201cDetour.\u201dA skeleton went to the side and swung its sword.The sword was struck deep in its neck, and it dropped to the ground, dead.\u201cNice, well done.\u201dRattle.Rattle.Skeletons waved their weapons and celebrated their victory.Simon approached and squatted in front of the monster\u2019s corpse. When he took the tongue pad and brought it close, the tongue stretched out and swallowed the monster\u2019s mana.His score increased by 2 points.\u201cThis is also inedible. Let\u2019s go.\u201dPier\u2019s clone, who was watching this scene, smiled. Simon\u2019s skeleton operation was getting better and better.Just like that, Simon left the jungle and arrived at the beach. It was a place with a small dockside. The servants were moving their luggage, and two assistant teachers were guarding the place.\u201cWhat?\u201dAnd one of the assistant teachers was someone who had a bad relationship with Simon.Brett, the assistant teacher for Combat Magic, said while frowning,\u201cWhy are you here? Students are prohibited from entering this place. Get lost.\u201dBrett waved his hand.Simon let out a wry smile and bowed his head.\u201cOr what?\u201dBrett hit his chest with his fist.\u201cDo you want to go against me because the students aren\u2019t enough for you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass. Take care~\u201dSimon made a clean refusal and left the place. He left the beach and headed back into the thick forest.\u2018Seeing that that man is here, it should be somewhere close.\u2019As Simon looked around him, he noticed a stretch of cobwebs connected like a road.When Simon walked along with it, he saw a large cobweb spread out at the end of its destination. A bracelet was placed on it.That was the subspace bracelet.\u201cNow it\u2019s time for us to meet Pier.\u201d[Kuhehehe!]Simon looked around carefully just in case.In the sky of the island, there were magical instruments from Kizen headquarters called \u2018Observers\u2019 roaming around and checking the situation.Since the entire first-year was thrown in for this assessment. The test wasn\u2019t administered by the professors but by Kizen headquarters directly.\u2018Okay.\u2019There were hardly any students here, so the Observers were nowhere to be seen.Confirming that no one was looking at him, Simon put the bracelet on his arm.Then, after he clenched his fist three times in a row, the bracelet\u2019s subspace opened in the air.[Kuhehehehehe! I waited for so long!]And what came out of it was Pier and a troop of conscripted skeletons.The Legion appeared on Kera Island.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80After summoning Pier from the subspace bracelet, Simon opened his own subspace this time.\u201cWell, there\u2019s no time. Please come to my side while no one\u2019s around, Pier.\u201dPier clicked his tongue.[It feels suffocating! Do I have to go back in when I just came out?]\u201cWe have no choice. Hurry before anyone sees.\u201dThere was a reason for transferring the Legion in such a cumbersome way.Before being teleported to the island, Kizen announced that they\u2019d be inspecting everyone\u2019s subspaces.But for Simon, he had to somehow take Pier to persuade the new captain, \u2018Big Krum\u2019, so he pulled some tricks.\u201cCommaannddeerrr~\u201dSimon looked back in surprise from the sudden deep voice.Assistant Teacher Brett was running towards him.The appearance of that muscular, bald man with a rough look waving his arms to the side and running cutely evoked a sense of incongruity that would make one gasp.\u201cI missed you!\u201dBrett clung to Simon\u2019s arm, speaking in a sweet voice.Simon said while frowning from the sense of incongruity that was about to make him lose his mind,\u201cWhy did you come here, Eliza? An assistant teacher was next to you.\u201d\u201cI just told that woman that I have something to do.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026 Get back quickly before we get caught.\u201dSo here\u2019s what happened.Last weekend, Simon won the duel that Brett first proposed, allowing Simon to order him to do anything.So Simon went to the dormitory where Brett was staying.At that time, Brett was packing things like a person who had given up on everything.\u201cWhy are you doing this miserable thing? I have no intention of asking you to leave the school.\u201dBrett lifted his head and looked at Simon.\u201cInstead, you\u2019ll be my chess piece from now on.\u201dSimon was clearly holding a sword over Brett\u2019s head, and Brett opposed it immediately.\u201cAre you saying that a freshman like you is planning on treating me like a slave?!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like that, I guess there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019ll go to Professor Hong Feng and tell her everything.\u201dAt those words, Brett\u2019s face immediately went stiff.\u201cYou, who\u2019s in the position of an educator, beat up a Kizen student for a bet. And what\u2019s worse is that the condition for if you won was\u2026\u2026\u201dA smirk formed on Simon\u2019s face.\u201cMe becoming a direct disciple of Professor Hong Feng, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you clearly. That\u2019s not for the professor. Rather, it\u2019s an insult to the professor\u2019s decision.\u201dHong Feng had already accepted Simon\u2019s rejection. However, Brett suddenly intervened and beat up Simon, telling Simon to become Hong Feng\u2019s direct disciple if he won.This was an act ignoring Hong Feng\u2019s will.\u201cProfessor thinks that what happened between us was just a mere quarrel. But I hope you do know how disappointed she\u2019ll be if she\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s smirk widened.\u201c\u2026finds out the truth.\u201d\u201cKugh\u2026\u2026!\u201dIn fact, by forcing Simon to make such a bet, Brett had put himself in a situation he couldn\u2019t get out of.And just like that, Simon acquired a great chess piece called Brett. And just in time, Brett so happened to be selected as an assistant teacher who would enter the island.Simon borrowed his subspace and then ordered him to remain hidden from anyone during the period of Island Survival.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re planning on impersonating me.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cThe tricks of Kizen students are beyond your imagination. Impersonation is common in this field.\u201dBrett scratched his head.\u201cDo as you wish. However, if you get caught, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAnd so, Brett hid himself, and Elizabeth came to this island while transformed as Brett instead.Pier had entered the subspace of Brett\u2019s bracelet and was able to safely cross over to the island, since the subspaces of the assistant teachers weren\u2019t subject to inspection.\u201cEveryone was completely deceived by my acting!\u201dSaid Elizabeth in Brett\u2019s thick voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s turning me off, so please stop it already.\u201d\u201cAnyway! You\u2019re going to see Big Krum now, am I right? I wanna tag along.\u201d\u201cNot a chance.\u201dSimon flatly declined.\u201cIf Brett suddenly disappears from his position, the school will suspect him. Pier and I are enough for this.\u201d[Kuhehe! What the kid is saying is right! Get lost already!]\u201cNot even you, Pier?! You are all so mean.\u201dElizabeth\u2019s head sank as she became crestfallen.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll return now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing her drooping down, Simon felt a light prick in his conscience.From recruiting Brett to impersonating him, it was no exaggeration to say that Elizabeth actually did everything for this operation. It felt like he acted a bit cold toward her.[What are you doing, Boy?]Then Pier spoke into Simon\u2019s head.[If it bothers you that much, give her a reward. It\u2019s also the role of the Commander to praise their subordinates!]\u2018What? Wh-What kind of reward?\u2019[You probably know what she likes even without me telling you.]Of course, he was aware of it.Simon let out a small sigh and lifted his head up. He could see a rough man bowing his head down with a sore expression on his face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Eliza. Could you return to your original form for a moment?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShe looked puzzled, but returned to her original form as commanded. Simon then approached her with a stiff gait.[Commander?]Then, he stretched out his arms and hugged her tight.[\u2026\u2026!!!]Elizabeth was so surprised that she was stuck frozen in place. Simon whispered in a barely audible voice,\u201cY-You did well, Eliza.\u201dElizabeth\u2019s eyes widened.Her heart\u2026It had melted, turned to mush.\u201cHmph hmph.\u201dFlushed, Simon hurriedly backed away.\u201cNow turn into Brett and go back to your position. After all, there\u2019s nothing good about being suspicious.\u201dSimon disappeared like he was running, drenched in sweat.Seeing this, Pier\u2019s clone giggled loudly, leaving Simon wondering about what was so funny.[\u2026\u2026]Elizabeth, who had been staring blankly at Simon\u2019s back for a moment, gripped at her shoulders before covering her reddened face.[\u2026\u2026Truly a lovely person.]She felt like affirming her loyalty a hundred, no, a thousand times wouldn\u2019t be enough.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Night was approaching.Kizen students gradually adapted to the unfamiliar environment and monsters, and now were moving toward the center.However, as the day began to darken, they encountered a new crisis. Just like every tropical area, the daily temperature difference in Kera island was quite extreme.The muggy weather suddenly turned cold enough to feel chills. Besides, it was common knowledge that monsters were more active at night.\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to make a shelter to spend the night after all.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a fire first!\u201dA situation where you had to make a shelter and a bonfire to maintain body temperature and good sleep.However, the students had a hard time finding a place to stay. They were afraid of the monsters attacking them in the middle of the jungle, and there was a fear of being attacked by other students in a place with a river or on a flat area that was too open.Some students tried to work their brains to make a shelter in a tree, but the problem was that they didn\u2019t have the skills.\u201cOw, my back. I\u2019m actually gonna die.\u201d\u201cI mean, isn\u2019t this just for a single night? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to not do this bullshit at all to save energy?\u201dSome of the students who were cutting down trees and dragging them decided to camp out after feeling a deep sense of doubt.However, as the night went on, the temperature drastically dropped, and it seemed wise to at least block the wind.Like that, as the students were progressing using trial and error\u2026Thud! Thud! Thud!Wipe. Wipe.Simon\u2019s shelter was quickly approaching completion.He laid down equally sized trees, wrapped them up with a durable stem several times, and tied the stem tight.After raising the pillars and building the frame by placing the beginnings of a roof over the pre-prepared grooves, he took out large leaves from the subspace and covered it to finish the roof.\u201cYou, tie the fence over there. Leave the trees you brought on the right.\u201dThud. Thud.The shelter was completed in a snap when one human and four undead joined forces.It was too small to fit anyone else with Simon, but the quality was satisfying enough for a shelter to spend a day in.The shelter was made close to the beach, so it was opposite to the progress of the Kizen students.Also, because it was near the beach, it was slightly outside the territory of carnivorous monsters. It was perfect in many ways.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that I don\u2019t have to be wary of other people.\u201dHe made a bonfire without worrying about people before crushing up the herb that wards off insects and snakes, mixing it with a little bit of water and spreading it evenly around the house.After all the work was done, Simon went straight into the completed treehouse. He thought that it was pretty cozy, even if he made it himself.\u201cWell, now then\u2026\u201dSimon laid flat on his back and covered himself with a blanket of leaves.\u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep.\u201d[What? You\u2019re sleeping already?]Said Pier in surprise.[But it\u2019s not even that late in the night yet!]\u201cI\u2019m planning to sleep early and start working early tomorrow. Ah, right!\u201dSimon got up and took out Pier\u2019s clone from his school uniform before hanging it outside the house like a decoration.[What! What is the meaning of this, Boy?!]\u201cPlease keep a night watch for me, Pier. Undead don\u2019t sleep, right?\u201d[Kugh! Unbelievable! I\u2019m a marshall of the Legion! How dare you use me like this!]\u201cI\u2019m counting on you~ and I\u2019ll put this here, so please wake me up at 4am.\u201dSimon placed the wristwatch down so Pier\u2019s clone could see it, and went back to the shelter.[How dare you use me as an alarm!!]Simon even disconnected from the undead\u2019s thoughts and covered himself with the leaves, preparing to sleep.After tossing and turning for a moment, he quickly fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.* * *[Wake up, Boy! It\u2019s already the time you mentioned!]At the sound of Pier\u2019s clone shouting, Simon sat up. Then, he gripped his shoulders and sniffled from the coldness.\u201cAchoo! It\u2019s pretty cold at night. Thank you, Pier.\u201d[I\u2019ll make sure to remember this humiliation!]\u201cI\u2019ll add more soldiers to the legion as soon as I have the money.\u201d[You do now know how to give a reward.]Simon yawned while coming out.He could see a beautiful morning sky colored in turquoise as the sounds of the sea floated into his ears. It was a pretty elegant sight.\u201cThen, shall we get going?\u201dSimon opened the subspace and took out four skeletons.\u201cNow, lift on the count of three. One, two, three!\u201dSimon made the skeletons lift the whole shelter.Because it was only made for one person, lifting it wasn\u2019t that hard.[What are you going to do now?]\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I?\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cI\u2019ll get to the center in one go.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Simon was making his way through the thick forest.Behind him were the skeletons carrying the wooden house he made yesterday.\u2018This is what I like about Summoning, after all.\u2019After learning Summoning, his hands and shoulders were always light.Even when he entered a place full of monsters like now, he felt comfortable. His summons would rush in and kill any monsters before Simon even found it.All Simon had to do was just pass by the finished site and collect the tongue-pad points.There were countless other advantages that large numbers gave, but it would be a waste of breath to mention them all.\u2018Huh?\u2019Simon, who was taking the lead, stopped in his tracks and looked at the defecation of a monster on the grass.And a footprint next to the defecation\u2026 It looked like Simon had entered the area of activity of a level 2 monster, \u2018wreckers\u2019.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s up the pace.\u201dAt Simon\u2019s orders, the walking speed of the skeletons carrying the house quickened.[By the way, Boy.]Pier spoke to Simon.[Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re going to the center in one go? What kind of method are you planning to use?]\u201cAh, it\u2019s simple.\u201dWhen Simon came out of the jungle through the large leaves, a panoramic view unfolded before their eyes.Swaaaaaaaaa!The sound of running water filled their ears.\u201cI\u2019m going to get on a boat and go with the stream.\u201d[Get on a boat? When are you going to make\u2026\u2026 Hah!]Pier\u2019s clone moved his eyes to see the wooden house the skeletons were carrying.\u2018I see! Now that I look at it, it wasn\u2019t a house, but a wooden boat.\u2019\u201cNow, come down slowly.\u201dRattle.Rattle.Simon also helped the skeletons, carrying the tree house on his back and carefully descending the steep rock face. Pier continued the conversation.[The idea itself isn\u2019t bad, but a river usually flows from the inland to the sea, right?]\u201cI\u2019ll explain.\u201dSimon drew a picture in the air with his one free hand.\u201cImagine a large island in the center and four small islands surrounding it. Are you following along?\u201d[Mhm! I understand.]\u201cI heard it from Rick, so apparently this whole area isn\u2019t \u2018Kera Island.\u2019 \u201cSimon gestured to a large land in the center.\u201cOnly this central island is called Kera Island.\u201d[What?]\u201cThe correct name for this area is \u2018Kera Archipelago\u2019. The rest of the islands are separate islands from Kera Island. In other words\u2026\u201dSimon pointed to a water stream between the islands. It surrounded Kera Island and the Kera Archipelago. It was where Simon was right now.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a river, but an ocean.\u201d[Oho!]\u201cHe said it tastes salty when you try to drink it, so It\u2019s not a river, but an ocean that flows from island to island.\u201dSimon checked the time with his watch and opened the subspace.\u201cAnd the currents at this time of the day are said to always be the exact same.\u201d[Wooof! Woof!][Grrrrr!]Then he heard a dog barking in the forest.\u2018Crap!\u2019A group of six-legged wreckers found Simon and started running toward him.By the look of it, they had come here after the smell.\u201cEveryone, hurry up!\u201dSimon and the skeletons upped their pace going down the cliff.However, the opponent was a native monster here. They were able to come down the steep cliff smoothly.\u2018They\u2019ll catch up if it keeps going like this.\u2019Fighting on a cliff like this would be really dangerous. Simon quickly put his brain to work and stared at the seawater flowing below.\u201cStop! Let\u2019s just drop it here!\u201dSimon and the skeletons slightly bent their knees and threw the wooden house.The house fell into the water with a splash.[Woof! Woof! Woof!]Simon pulled all his skeletons into his subspace and ran.\u201cHuap!\u201dThen, without looking back, he leaped down the cliff with all his might, stepping on jet-black, the claws of the wreckers barely grazing Simon\u2019s uniform.\u2018Perfect timing!\u2019Poooow!Simon landed right in the treehouse as it was being swept away by the current. The boat swayed from the impact, and the seawater formed white foam as it drenched Simon\u2019s body. However\u2026\u2018It worked!\u2019Simon clenched his fists. The boat didn\u2019t sink, and he managed to get on properly.In the distance, wreckers barked as all their efforts turned into vain.[Kuhehehe! Good! Very good!]Pier laughed as though teasing them.Soon, the wooden boat began to float away with great speed.The speedy journey was surprisingly pleasant, water droplets splashing over and over.\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? That I\u2019ll turn the tables in one go.\u201dIt was still early in the morning.While most of the Kizen students were asleep after exhausting themselves building a shelter, making a fire, and hunting prey, Simon was making his way to Kera Island, the destination in the center, almost like a free pass.You couldn\u2019t compare his speed to other students, and the fear of being attacked by other students was greatly reduced, since it was dawn.[Bwahahahahaha! This is great!]Simon and Pier moved forward smoothly, riding on the current.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *\u201cI came here just in case, but\u2026\u201dRick let out a deep sigh. Seven Kizen students were standing behind him with weapons.He was standing at the area where you could go up to the central Kera island from the other four islands of the Kera archipelago. Each island was connected by a huge bridge made out of rock.At first glance, it looked like a natural bridge that had been on this island from the very beginning, but in reality, it was a bridge built by Kizen for Island Survival. Due to dark-magic enchantments, it was effectively indestructible if you didn\u2019t dish out quite a bit of firepower.On this bridge, the team that Rick had put together were confronting the students on the other side of the bridge.\u2018Well, I mean, there\u2019s no way that they aren\u2019t blocking this place.\u2019Rick scratched his head.In order to advance to the center, you definitely had to go through this place. So he purposely started moving from the crack of dawn when others were sleeping, but other students were guarding it, as he expected.\u201cWhat are we going to do now, Rick?\u201dAsked a male student carrying a skull scythe.Rick was absolutely trusted by the team members here.He possessed all the knowledge and life skills that other noble students didn\u2019t have, such as finding his way easily even in a dense jungle, knowing how to build a shelter, finding edible fruits, and butchering monsters.Within just one day, the entire team was deeply dependent on Rick.\u201cMm.\u201dRick folded his arms and pondered for a moment.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any good ideas in a terrain like this. I\u2019ll go and try to negotiate with their side. I\u2019ll try to trade it out by giving them food, but if that doesn\u2019t work, we gotta take the bull by the horns.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cI believe you, Rick.\u201dIt was when Rick took a deep breath and was about to walk toward the bridge.\u201cUhh, what\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a person!\u201dClamors could be heard from everywhere. Rick turned his head and looked towards the side of the sea, and soon, delight filled his face.\u2018Simon!\u2019Swaaaaaaaaaa!Simon, on a wooden boat, was approaching the central Kera island along with the current.\u201cWoah! After seeing that rapid current, he actually thought of riding on a boat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Truly exceptional.\u201dRick desperately held back his smile and looked down at Simon\u2019s face.\u2018As expected from Simon! You crazy bastard!\u2019Rick had also imagined going across by riding on the sea.However, he came to the conclusion that it was practically impossible.First of all, it was impossible to change direction by rowing when considering how strong the current was. Moreover\u2026\u201cShoot him! Shoot that bastard!\u201dThe students on the other side of the bridge wouldn\u2019t just leave you alone. Jet-black arrows and various other dark spells began to pour toward Simon\u2019s ship.\u2018I need to help him.\u2019The team members here were just the ones he met to fulfill the needs of each other, but Simon was different. He was the most important friend he wanted to be with for the next 3 years.Rick looked back and shouted,\u201cEveryone, now\u2019s the time! Let\u2019s cross the bridge!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026N-Now?\u201d\u201cThat guy on the boat over there is taking all their attention! We need to cross now!\u201dAt Rick\u2019s push, the other students also nodded. Soon, everyone rushed toward the bridge while shouting.\u201cThey\u2019re coming from the other side of the bridge!\u201d\u201cShoot them down first!\u201dThe firepower that had been focused on Simon was dispersed toward the bridge. Simon looked at it and smiled.\u2018Thankfully, they started moving too. Now\u2019s my chance.\u2019The current was getting faster, and the ship\u2019s direction was getting closer to the landing point Simon wanted.\u2018Now, a little bit closer, a little bit closer\u2026\u2026\u2019Whaaaam!The ear-piercing sound of cannon firing burst forth.As Simon raised his head, there was a slight shadow around him. A large jet-black cannonball was falling toward Simon\u2019s ship.It looks like there were skilled ones over the bridge too. The trajectory was so precise that it\u2019d be impossible to dodge it.Simon grinned and collected jet-black in his legs. Then, without hesitation, he jumped out of the boat.Kaboom!Simon\u2019s boat was hit head-on by the cannonball and fell to pieces.\u201cWhoooop!\u201dWhat he did from now on would be crucial. Simon opened the subspace and dropped a skeleton.The skeleton\u2019s arms were hugging onto a water hyacinth obtained from the jungle earlier. Water hyacinths were plants that floated on water. The same was true for the skeletons he was using, their bones also floating.\u2018Over there!\u2019The skeleton accurately fell in the direction Simon wanted, holding the water hyacinth. Then, Simon stepped on it and jumped again.Repeating the act of dropping a skeleton using the subspace and stepping on it. It was like jumping across stepping stones.\u201cWoah!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How does that make sense?\u201dThe jaws of the students who were watching dropped after seeing the almost stunt-like acrobatics. As the attack from the ground became harsher, Simon laid the skeletons on the water\u2019s surface and started running.\u2018Jet-black stepping!\u2019Whoooosh!Simon, who flew several meters in the air to avoid the jet-black arrows, spun a full 360 before landing on the ground.He immediately opened the subspace and pulled out the remains of the skeletons. Most of them only had their lower bodies left.Then, Simon looked back and stretched out his right arm.\u2018Restore!\u2019The bone fragments being carried away by the current floated up in the air before flying like lightning and assembling themselves with the bodies of the skeletons inland.In an instant, more than ten skeletons were restored, and only the water hyacinths were carried away in the rapids.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAnd just like that, Simon fled to the forest along with the skeletons.\u2018Wheew. For real, that guy\u2026\u2026!\u2019Let out Rick, in admiration after seeing that. Not only Rick but, of course, the other students across the bridge were wide-eyed.\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d\u201cSo you can use skeletons like that too, huh?\u201dAnd then, all of a sudden, one of the students across the bridge turned his back and left the formation without permission.\u201cHey, wait! Why are you suddenly moving?\u201dThe student next to him grabbed his shoulder. At that moment, a black devil arm burst out from the man\u2019s back and smashed the student.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?!\u201dBetrayal at this timing?! Haren Cork, who pulled out the black hand from his back, said with a smirk,\u201cDeal with them yourselves. I\u2019ve got something else to do.\u201dAfter leaving those words, Haren ran toward the line of trees Simon disappeared into.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82The timing for Simon crossing over to the center was perfect.As the day brightened and the students resumed their activities in earnest, the four bridges to cross to the central Kera Island transformed into bloody battlefields.Students who had their own way of crossing the river could avoid the conflict, but if they did not, they had to use the bridge.\u201cLetting you pass for only 50 points!\u201dIn particular, on the western island, there was an incident where a faction of Class E students formed around the Special Admission No. 7 named \u2018Elissa\u2019, who was in that class. They took over the bridge and used the point transfer function of the tongue pad to receive points like a toll.Thanks to that, the students who started on the western island were tied up there for a while.In the end, a large-scale alliance was formed to overthrow Elissa\u2019s faction on the western island, and Elissa quickly retreated from the bridge.While the battles across the island were developing, there being no time to catch a single breath, Simon, who arrived early on the central Kera Island, was focusing on the search for Big Krum.In a way, it was more important for Simon to find Big Krum and sign a contract with him than to get the top rank for Island Survival.\u201cPhew. But it\u2019s pretty hard to find his traces, Pier.\u201dSaid Simon as he plowed through thickets.[We can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s not the type to leave traces.]Replied Pier\u2019s clone, hanging on the school uniform.[But when the Kizen students start fighting on the central island, the chances of an irritated Big Krum appearing will naturally increase!]\u201cWe should look forward to that then.\u201dAccording to Pier, Big Krum was usually small enough to look like a mushroom that grows wild on the street.However, the more threatened or angry he was, the bigger he became, and when he was fully grown, his height exceeded 20 meters.If that happened, he\u2019d surely stand out, so Simon thought that it\u2019d be better to wait in an area of conflict in case Big Krum appeared than to blindly search for traces.As he was walking towards the center like that, he saw a canyon in the distance.When looking down at Kera Island from above, a towering mountain could be seen in the center. At first, the terrain only gradually steepened, but from here on out, it increased dramatically.\u2018It really is quite tall.\u2019In order to reach the final destination of Island Survival, \u2018The Indestructible Mansion\u2019, you had to cross this canyon, no matter what.Climbing the canyon itself was difficult unless you had the relevant skills. There was also the problem that you became vulnerable to long-distance attacks from the ground, standing out while climbing.Of course, there was a normal route for you to climb.As Simon continued walking along the canyon, he saw an area where the hills were layered like stairs. It was a place reminiscent of terraced fields in the highlands, and there were crude tents and huts bunched together.And in those huts swarmed monsters dwarfish in height.\u2018\u2026\u2026Th-That\u2019s a lot.\u2019Level 2 monster, Kera.The reason why this island was called Kera Island.Keras looked similar to the goblins that could be found anywhere on the continent, but they were smaller and thinner. Even when they became adults, they were said to be the size of a small child.Still, because they were monsters, they had tremendous reproductive ability, and they practically dominated this island with the advantages of being able to handle weapons and having excellent cooperation.The camp of these keras was spread out across the best way to climb up the canyon.\u2018I came late on purpose, thinking that others might have cleaned them up, but\u2026\u2026\u2019You could see some burns and traces of broken huts.However, considering the overall size of this camp, the damage was inconsequential. Simon had to break through this place on his own after all.Rustle.While Simon was distracted by the camp for a moment, he heard rustles from the bushes behind him.Simon spun around and readied his jet-black. His skeletons were also on alert, rattling about.\u201cWait! I\u2019m not wanting to fight.\u201dA male student in a Kizen uniform came out of the bush with his hands raised. He was a man with gray, receding hair.\u201c\u2026\u2026Who are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Vincent Werley, from Class C.\u201dVincent smiled softly and continued.\u201cYou\u2019re planning to cross that kera camp, right?\u201d\u201cThen let us help! Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to break through alone with that many of them.\u201d\u201cUs?\u201dVincent let out a slight smile and pointed behind him.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring them here, I was afraid that you\u2019d be frightened, but there are eight more with me.\u201dEight people, huh?Simon replied while wondering how he had gathered that many people,\u201cI\u2019m planning to go by myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you serious? That\u2019s a course meant to test team play! Going alone is just insane.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Vincent\u2019s offer to join forces seemed reasonable.However\u2026\u201cI have a different idea already. Sorry.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t trust Vincent yet. And he wasn\u2019t going to take the risk of teaming when there was a way to break through by himself.After finishing speaking, Simon turned his back and went into the woods.In the end, Vincent returned to his teammates ploddingly. His teammates were sitting in some place chatting.\u201cWhat did he say?\u201dVincent shrugged at his teammate\u2019s question.\u201cHe said he\u2019d go up on his own?\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201d\u201cLook at him bluffing. Looks like he hasn\u2019t tasted bitter defeat yet.\u201dVincent\u2019s team had a lively atmosphere. Moreover, having come to Kera Island right away on the second day, it was safe to say that everyone had sufficient skills.\u201cShall I chase him and bring him back?\u201dAsked one of the team members. Vincent shook his head.\u201cNah. It\u2019s a waste of time. Let\u2019s just focus on our own business.\u201d\u201cIf he begs for us to let him into our team later, I\u2019ll just beat him up and get some points.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dVincent\u2019s team moved in a friendly atmosphere.It didn\u2019t take them long to arrive in front of the kera camp. They could see the dwarf-like kera roaming on the top of that stair-like hill.\u201cThis is a fight of speed.\u201dSaid Vincent while getting the attention of his teammates.\u201cIt\u2019s more important to take even a single step forward than it is to hunt a monster. I doubt we\u2019ll be taken down by kera, since we\u2019re Kizen, but once we get tired and start to slow down, we may have to deal with the entire camp\u2019s forces.\u201dEveryone nodded with serious faces.\u201cWell then, let us get to the positions we discussed before and start right away.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThey immediately went into formation to charge through. Two Combat Magic aspirants took the lead, followed by Jet-Black Mechanics, Curses, and Hemomancy aspirants.The leader, Vincent, was standing right in the middle of the formation.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The eight team members started climbing the hill at once.[Kerrugh!][Kerurrurgh!]Nearby keras also saw them and rushed in. Maybe because the emergency alert hadn\u2019t been rung yet, they were just running out of their huts one by one.\u201cThey\u2019re just kera.\u201dThe Combat Magic aspirants taking the lead gathered jet-black into their fists and swung.Poow!The keras were launched away, heads already caved in from a single punch. The firepower of the students from the rear was poured out, and the surroundings were neatly devastated.\u201cThis way! This is the fastest way up!\u201dVincent led the team, and everyone came together, breaking through with a terrifying force. However, at this point, the monsters were actively swarming them. Even reaching halfway up was a struggle.\u201cWe\u2019re already halfway there! Just a little bit more!\u201dVincent clapped and encouraged his teammates. The students, drenched in sweat, later realized something was wrong.\u2018W-We\u2019re only halfway there?\u2019Climbing the hill while fighting was more tiring than it looked.Moreover, it wasn\u2019t easy to hunt the quick monsters who didn\u2019t even reach the students\u2019 waists.However, there was no other option, as there were monsters constantly swarming them from behind. Everyone clenched their teeth and ran.\u201cAaaaaagh!\u201dWhile forcibly breaking through, a problem ended up arising.One of the teammates had sprained his ankle while sprinting up, rolling onto the floor while clutching his leg.Everyone turned around in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cUgh! M-My ankle!\u201dVincent ran to him first and gave the student a shoulder as support.\u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this! Hang in there!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Th-Thank you.\u201dThe already slow pace was reduced by nearly half because of the injury.The Combat Magic aspirants in the lead were finding it uncomfortable while beating the monsters up.\u2018Am I hindering them? If we dare to bring the wounded, we\u2019ll all be wiped out because of that one person.\u2019It wasn\u2019t like he was really going to die anyway, and when the barrier gauge reached 0%, the emergency shield would turn on, and he would immediately be teleported to a safe space.Right now, it was a situation where they couldn\u2019t guarantee if they could break through the camp if everyone was in good condition.He thought they did not need to take the injured person with a broken leg.The other students thought the same. The team had a very good atmosphere, so they couldn\u2019t say it out loud, but they all felt the same way.\u201cTen more in front!\u201d\u201cThey keep on coming!\u201dThe slower the speed and which they broke through, the more monsters they had to face.Now, both stamina and jet-black were at their limit. At that moment when everyone felt their limits and were about to give up\u2026Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!Out of nowhere, a deep, earthshaking rumble resounded.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned. A monster was just walking through the dense terrain of the kera tribe, who gathered like a swarm of ants.\u201cI-It\u2019s a golem! That\u2019s a golem, right?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s riding on it!\u201dSimon, who was riding on the mud golem, was smiling while enjoying the cool breeze. Below that, Pier\u2019s clone below him was bursting out laughing.[Bwahahahahaha! Go! Go on!]For small keras, the golem was truly like a giant itself.No other means of attack were needed. Countless keras were trampled to death just by the golem running.Vincent wondered if there was any other way to break through a monster\u2019s camp this ignorantly.But it was far more effective. The aggressive keras were now busy running away. The golem was like a wolf that came into a flock of sheep.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the guy who said he\u2019d climb alone?\u201d\u201cInsane. Woah, he\u2019s actually going to make it by himself.\u201dVincent\u2019s team members were looking at Simon with gazes mixed with admiration and envy.It was a little shameless, having ridiculed him earlier, but some students hoped he might save them. However, Simon and the golem just passed by as though they didn\u2019t see them.It was then.[Kerugh! (What\u2019s wrong?)]Hearing the commotion, a kera adorned with colorful decorations appeared from the hut.[Kerugh! Kerururugh! (The humans have invaded!)][Kerurugh! (Leave it to me!)]He was the Chieftain of the kera\u2019s tribe.Just by the appearance of the Chieftain, the morale of the keras greatly increased. Nearby keras began to raise their weapons and cheer.Whoooosh!As the Chieftain lifted the staff in his hand, flames flickered into existence and began to rapidly form into a single mass.He was none other than the only kera who could use magic!The moment he aimed his staff and was about to fire the spell\u2026Squash!He was hit by a running golem and died immediately.Simon didn\u2019t notice at all, looking somewhere else.\u2018Huh, what? Did I bump into something?\u2019It was just that kind of reaction.However, the impact of Simon removing the boss was huge.The keras, having lost their commander in a single moment, fell into confusion and began to flounder.\u201cHuh? Why aren\u2019t these guys rushing in?\u201dVincent\u2019s team members noticed the change as well. Vincent bit his lips with a hardened face and stepped forward.\u201cLooks like something changed! Let\u2019s all take a breather\u2026\u2026!\u201d[Kerugh!][Kerurugh!]And all of a sudden, some keras around Vincent began to go to a knee, facing him.As Vincent stepped back with a bewildered face, a sword suddenly was pointed at his neck.\u201cHuuff! Wh-What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cI knew there was something odd.\u201dThe male student who pointed his sword at Vincent said in a cold voice,\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re the only one with a barrier gauge of 100% right now? Why are you the only one not being attacked by monsters?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c100%? For real?\u201dThe other students also realized that something was odd and went into an uproar.\u201cGuiding us in the wrong way and going round and round on purpose in order for us to make us lose our energy, slowing down by taking an injured person with us, and making a drama\u2026 It\u2019s pretty clear now. Don\u2019t tell me, you\u2026\u2026\u201dThe male student ripped the necklace off Vincent\u2019s neck.Vincent stretched his arms out in fright, but the male student stopped him by placing a sword close to his neck before examining the necklace\u2019s shape.\u201cThis looks similar to what the keras are wearing. Isn\u2019t this an artifact from the \u2018supplies\u2019?The supplies contained various kinds of artifacts that\u2019d help you in Island Survival, not only food.Perhaps this was something that made keras consider the wearer an ally, or it was a necklace with the effect of gaining respect.He threw the necklace in his hand to the girl next to him. The female student put the necklace on herself, and then approached the kerasThe keras around her flinched and backed away, and soon knelt down toward her.The female student made an exasperated face.\u201cSo you fooled us, Vincent?\u201d\u201cN-No! Everyone, calm down! Hear me out!\u201dThe atmosphere became cold in an instant.\u201cSo you were planning to get all our points after we\u2019re all wiped out?\u201d\u201cNo wonder why he\u2019s the only one with a lot of points.\u201d\u201cAre there any other victims besides us?\u201dOnce the suspicion emerged, it grew out of control. The girl wearing the necklace beckoned as though giving a signal.\u201cI guess there\u2019s no need to speak more. Goodbye.\u201dThe sword pointed at Vincent\u2019s neck drew its line.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83After safely climbing up the canyon, Simon had now entered the true central area.A jungle, dense with vegetation, unfolded like a painting. The atmosphere was definitely different from here on.Explosions and the sound of weapons clashing could be heard coming from everywhere. Monsters at the top of the island\u2019s food chain, those considered level 3 or higher, also appeared here.After retrieving the golem core, Simon began to take care with his steps and started to be on closer watch than before. He knew that he\u2019d be the target of students and monsters if he made even the slightest mistake.\u201cPhew.\u201dSimon wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked around.He hadn\u2019t faced any Kizen students, managing to rack up 127 points through hunting alone. However, starting from here, he had to be prepared to fight at least two or three Kizen students.Whirrr!Just as expected. Simon raised his head up after feeling a sudden heat. Out of nowhere, dark flames were falling over his head.\u2018The same type of jet-black flames as Meilyn\u2019s!\u2019Baaaaam!As Simon was looking at the black flame spreading across the grass after stepping and dodging it, another flame was shot at his flank before he realized it.\u2018It\u2019s fast\u2026\u2026!\u2019Smaash!Rumble!They could fire continuously with that level of firepower. Simon ran frantically and dodged the attack.As he was about to step up a tree to widen the distance at once, a large flame burst forth and swept the tree away.Watching a tree burn down in mere seconds was terrifying.\u2018This is quite dangerous.\u2019After swerving in his path, Simon landed on the ground. Then, the opponent who randomly attacked also came down from the tree and showed themselves.Simon\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cMeilyn!\u201dIt was really Meilyn. With her arms crossed, she smiled and waved her hand gently.\u201cSo it was you after all, Simon.\u201d\u201cI was worried about you! How were you doing until now? Did you ea\u2014\u201dThud.Then, Meilyn spread her palms out.A warning sign to not get any closer.\u201c\u2026\u2026M-Meilyn?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the same group ever since we were in Kizen. We worked together and relied on each other.\u201dSimon quickly finished grasping the situation.Her atmosphere was different to usual. Her eyes looked quite dull.\u201cHonestly, aren\u2019t you curious?\u201dDark flames sizzled and whirred up on her palms.\u201cOn which one of us is stronger.\u201dSimon pulled forth jet-black, face stiff.\u201cAre you planning to fight me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dMeilyn answered immediately.\u201cWe don\u2019t always get this kind of opportunity where we can fight with all our might.\u201d\u201cCalm down. It\u2019s inefficient to spend each other\u2019s energy in a situation like this.\u201dHer eyes hardened.\u201cBrace yourself!\u201dWhaaaaaaaap!The fire grew even stronger in her hand. Simon cooled his head and started to think objectively.\u2018Something\u2019s strange after all.\u2019Simon knew that Meilyn was running toward the top, surpassing 1st place in Class A. He was well aware of her competitive spirit. He vaguely knew that he might someday clash with her.But wasn\u2019t this too urgent? Simon thought that something was wrong and took out skeletons from his subspace.\u201cHaaaah!\u201dShe stepped on jet-black and jumped into the air, continuously firing black flames.Whaaaap!Whirrrrr!Terrifying strikes were poured out offensively.The angle and direction in which the projectiles flew was also diverse. Moreover, when the black flames fell to the ground, they burned grass and trees alike, creating a danger zone. The space to dodge was shrinking in real-time.\u201cHaaaaaah!\u201dMeilyn was serious.In addition, she used the technique she showed in the last Duel Evaluation, multi-casting. While pouring out flames with her right hand, she was preparing a Dark Flare, what could be called her special move, in her left.It was absolutely perfect as it was.Meilyn was cornering Simon with her overwhelming abilities.\u2018I guess I can\u2019t help it.\u2019Simon also thought he should fight seriously.\u2018I know you as well as you know me.\u2019What Simon took out of the subspace was the gold bow. He held the bow with his left hand and an arrow in his right, enchanting it with jet-black.\u2018Huzzah!\u2019After jumping over the dark flames, Simon notched an arrow, aimed his bow at Meilyn, and\u2026Psh!\u2026released.The arrow pierced through the black flame, and Meilyn couldn\u2019t follow the path of the arrow because of the attack she fired.As a result, it cleanly hit her side. There were no wounds thanks to the protective suit, but the barrier gauge decreased a lot.You could see her stepping back in surprise.\u2018In terms of attack power, Meilyn is at the top of all the Kizen students. But a case like her where she pours all her firepower into an attack and suppresses the opponent\u2019s attack\u2026\u2019Simon notched an arrow and shot it again.\u2018\u2026is vulnerable to well-aimed physical attacks. Nothing else is needed.\u2019Thud!The next arrow lodged itself into a tree next to Meilyn\u2019s face. Beads of sweat ran down her forehead.\u201cDon\u2019t take me lightly!\u201dShe now attacked while running more actively. As Simon fired arrows one after another, maintaining the distance, she began to operate jet-black within her body.She started to run faster and faster, and the arrows hit nothing but the ground.\u2018Woah, it\u2019s gonna be tough for me if she\u2019s even good at Combat Magic here.\u2019Simon notched an arrow while in astonishment.It was hard to hit someone who was running with all their might.The best timing was\u2026\u201cHaaah!\u201dThe moment she shot her dark flames, Simon also released an arrow.The two of them dodged at the same time they attacked. Meilyn tilted her head, and Simon almost fell out of the way.Whaaaap!Thud!After exchanging blows, the two backed off, scratching into the dirt.Meilyn smiled.\u2018I don\u2019t have to rush at all. I can just stall time like this, and when the Dark Flare is ready\u2014\u2019Shk!She looked back at the sudden shock she felt on her thigh, startled.\u2018What? Who just\u2014\u2019As if Simon didn\u2019t want to give her time to think, he fired an arrow right in front of her.When she jumped to her side to dodge it and checked behind her\u2026Shhhhk!Shhak!This time, three arrows from different points around her, damaging her barrier gauge. The gauge had already been cut by more than half with arrows alone.\u2018What\u2019s going on?!\u2019After getting down on the ground, Meilyn quickly started putting her brain to work.An attack from three directions. She remembered that the number of skeleton archers that Simon uses was also three.\u2018I see. So he used skeleton archers\u2026\u2026!\u2019However, the places the arrows flew from were dark due to the dense forest, so the exact location couldn\u2019t be determined. It was also far enough away to be out of the black flames\u2019 range.\u2018Reload.\u2019Simon notched an arrow on the string, and the three skeleton archers connected to his thoughts also notched arrows at the same time and finished aiming at Meilyn.\u2018It\u2019s your weakness, ranged physical attacks. In addition to that, it\u2019s a four-way attack.\u2019The core of Summoning was definitely numbers.Simon, who made complete use of that advantage, pushed Meilyn back into a corner.\u2018Don\u2019t underestimate me. You\u2019re not the only one who can think here!\u2019She bit her lip and unfolded a new magic circle.Pshshshk!Two of the four arrows grazed by, and the gauge decreased by a huge chunk again.Simon and the skeleton archers started reloading again. She withdrew until her back was covered by a tree, went down to a knee, and placed her hand on the ground.<Jet-Black Elemental Magic Black Ice \u2013 Wall of Ice>Rumble!A barrier of ice covering all three undefended directions at once stretched out. All of the arrows bounced off after hitting the barrier.Seeing that, Simon lowered his bow with a light-hearted expression.\u2018I guess that\u2019s it.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 ArtethraxJoin our discord for updates on releases!* * *In fact, Simon had no intention of making her retire.Since she went on the defensive first, all he had to do was bring forth jet-black and run.The moment Simon was about to cleanly turn away,\u201cSimon!!\u201dHe heard Meilyn\u2019s cry from inside the ice.\u201cAre you really going to end it like this? Are you really going to end our first match in such a boring way?!!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon looked back again.\u201cFight me properly!\u201dCrackle!Finally, the Dark Flare was completed. You could see the ice wall quickly melting away because of the heat.\u2018I don\u2019t really know why you\u2019re doing this.\u2019Simon grabbed the bow again.\u2018But you going this far is also getting me worked up.\u2019The ice completely melted, and she started running. She held Dark Flare with both hands, bringing her internal operation of jet-black to its maximum.A combination of speed and attack with no regards for defense.Simon aimed the bow again and focused jet-black into both legs. The skeleton archers also prepared to fire.\u2018It\u2019s still impossible for me to accurately predict where to shoot with my skills. I\u2019ll finish it with a close-range shot.\u2019The distance between the two was getting narrower and narrower.It was an explosive situation.At that very moment when Simon was about to release the string\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026Hm?\u2019He saw cracks on the ground next to Meilyn.[Boy! It\u2019s him!]Pier\u2019s urgent voice resounded in his head.[It\u2019s Big Krum!]That was Big Krum? Simon\u2019s eyes widened sharply.Cracks rising from the ground were approaching her with a tremendous speed.At this point, she\u2019d end up hitting them head-on.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Simon threw away the bow he was aiming at her, then lowered his stance, gathering all the jet-black into his two legs.He then rushed toward her, pushing jet-black stepping to its limits.\u2018What? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019Meilyn\u2019s eyes shook.A charge like that in front of a Dark Flare was nothing but suicide. Now, if she stretched out her arm and activated the spell, it\u2019d be over, but she hesitated.No matter how much she looked at his desperate expression, it seemed that it was far from an attacker who wanted to harm her.Her arms paused for a moment. And finally, a question arose.\u2018Why am I\u2026\u2026 fighting against Simon?\u2019Thud!Simon hit her nape and knocked her out after breaking through in that moment of hesitation. Then, he grabbed her and leapt back as hard as he could without delay.Rrrrrrrrrrumble!Simon felt like the entire earth was being turned upside down. The ground exploded with a vibration, and something huge came out from the crack.\u2018What in the world\u2026\u2026?!\u2019It was a giant monster\u2019s arm wrapped in something like a green, bio-bandage.The hand grasped at empty air. Simon and Meilyn were able to dodge it by a whisker.\u2018Kugh!\u2019He wasn\u2019t prepared for the landing, not thinking about that when jumping. Simon hugged Meilyn tight and hit the ground with his own back.With a slam, Simon\u2019s body bounced like a spring, and Meilyn also rolled on the floor.\u201cMeilyn!\u201dMeilyn, who had lost consciousness, was rolling toward a cliff.The gigantic arm swept around as though searching for something before it pressed its palm to the ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSimon froze. From the canyon where the other side of the cliff could be seen, the face of a huge monster appeared.\u2018So that\u2019s\u2026\u2026!\u2019Big Krum, the former captain of the giant troops.Big Krum looked around him with an almost possessed gaze, but soon turned his back as if he couldn\u2019t find what he was looking for.[Boy! He\u2019s running away!]\u201cBut\u2026!\u201dMeilyn, who had lost consciousness, was rolling toward the sloped ground. Toward a cliff.Simon\u2019s gaze jumped between Big Krum and Meilyn before he clenched his teeth and ran toward Meilyn.\u2018I\u2019ll use jet-black stepping again!\u2019Simon ran with all his might. The moment when Meilyn was finally about to fall off the cliff after being swept down by the slope\u2026Tup.He narrowly managed to grab Meilyn\u2019s wrist.Simon, covered in dirt, gasped roughly for air and raised his head.Thud! Thud! Thud!The jaw-dropping giant was walking toward the other side of the cliff. His body, which had been looking around as though trying to find something, began to shrink slowly.Then, eventually, it became smaller than a tree, leaving Simon\u2019s sight.\u2018Phewww.\u2019Simon pulled up the still-unconscious Meilyn.Thanks to her protective suit, there seemed to be no injuries. However, her barrier gauge was also close to single digits.\u2018What is this?\u2019Also, there was a foreign white feather stuck to her neck.As Simon reached out his hand to take a closer look, the feather just scattered in the air and disappeared.Rustle. Rustle.\u2018Ah.\u2019Simon raised his head.Raindrops fell from the cloudy sky one by one, and then a sudden rain poured down\u2018I\u2019ll have to find a place to rest first. I can listen to the whole story later.\u2019Simon stood up, holding Meilyn in his arms.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meilyn.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s this big of a difference in skill?\u201d\u201cMiss, you aren\u2019t the successor anymore.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t a pleasant dream. While remembering something from her memory that she didn\u2019t want to recall, Meilyn came to her senses and opened her eyes.She could see a bumpy cave ceiling, and the sound of a crackling bonfire echoed in her ears.It was a little bit cold, but somewhat cozy. She slowly sat up and rubbed her eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dShe was wearing unfamiliar clothes. The robes were a bit large, and when she stretched out her arms, only her fingertips reached out of the sleeves.She looked around again. She was in a cave, and the rain kept on pouring outside.And in front of the bonfire seen at the cave entrance, a man with a thin but solid figure was sitting with his upper body exposed.Just then, he looked back and smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d\u201cS-Simon?!\u201dWhy was he naked again?!Meilyn quickly lowered her head in shock. Then, she saw her own outfit this time.\u201cWh-Wh-Wh-What\u2019s thissss?!\u201dUnderneath the robe that she was wearing, there was just wet underwear. Her face flushed red, and she reflexively covered her chest, gathering her legs together.After taking a very defensive stance and curling herself up, she said in a trembling voice,\u201cWh-What about my clothes?!\u201dSimon gave a sheepish grin and pointed with his fingertips. Near the cave exit, a wet male and a wet female school uniform sat drying out on vines tied like a clothesline.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dSimon cleared his throat.\u201cYou can catch a cold if you wear wet clothes and all, so\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dAs she reached the limit of the shame she could bear, Meilyn\u2019s face burned red all the way to the tips of her ears. Tears even formed in her eyes.\u201cY-Y-You fucking pervert bastaaaaaarrrrrrd!\u201d\u201cM-Meilyn! Keep it down\u2026\u2026!\u201dShe tried to throw something, but unfortunately, nothing was close. Simon stood up, sweating profusely.\u201cI promise nothing happened! I even closed my eyes when I took off your wet uniform!\u201d\u201cHaah, haah, haah\u2026\u201dShe shuddered, then covered her face with her palms.Seeing this, Simon just kept quiet and waited for her to calm down.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAbout 10 minutes passed in silence. Finally, Meilyn removed her palms covering her face, seemingly ready to face reality. Of course, her face was still red.\u201c\u2026\u2026What the hell happened?\u201dAs though waiting for her to ask, he explained himself.While they were fighting, a high-ranking monster intervened, and Meilyn, caught in the impact, went unconscious. On top of that, it started to rain, so he evacuated to a cave at the bottom of the cliff.\u2018The circumstances all add up. There\u2019s no room for doubt either.\u2019She knew that Simon wasn\u2019t the kind of guy to do weird things.But to think that she was undressed by a guy\u2026?! She wanted to disappear into a hole from the embarrassment.Meilyn sniffled and glared at Simon while curled up.Simon quickly looked away and pretended to scratch the side of his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cT-Turn around.\u201dSaid Meilyn in a barely audible voice.\u201cTurn around? Why?\u201d\u201cAh! I\u2019m going to change my clothes, so turn around, you idiioot!\u201dSimon, startled, quickly turned his back and stared at the bonfire.She would want Simon to go outside the cave for a while, but it was raining out there, so she had no choice.\u201cSt-Stay like that, okay?\u201d If you turn around, I\u2019ll really, really, really kill you!\u201dIt seemed like she was trying to scare him, but her voice was trembling, so it didn\u2019t feel like a threat at all.It just felt like the growl of a little puppy drenched in the rain.Simon answered while suppressing his feelings,\u201cSure. No need to worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn awkwardly got up, shoulders hunched over. She took out a dry towel and new underwear from the subspace while glancing at Simon from time to time.Simon still hadn\u2019t responded.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe let out an inward sigh of relief and grabbed the robe she was wearing.On the other hand, the person who was most nervous was Simon, not Meilyn.\u2018Wh-Why do I suddenly feel so nervous\u2026\u2026\u2019Contrary to Simon\u2019s normal values, the strong heart of a 17-year-old boy was racing like crazy.His eyes were glued to the bonfire, but he couldn\u2019t help but focus all his senses on his hearing.As though he was trying to somehow hear something he couldn\u2019t see.Then he heard the sound of a fiber being dragged, and the robe she was wearing fell to the floor.Rustle. Rustle.You could hear her taking off the wet underwear.Simon choked up. He kept on gulping in a strange way.Splat.Finally, the sound of wet underwear falling to the floor was heard. It felt heavy because of the rain.She really took everything off.Now, if he looked back, he\u2019d see Meilyn without anything on.The moment he realized that fact, Simon\u2019s heart pounded as if it had been broken.\u2018I-I\u2019d rather stay outside.\u2019Imagining her appearance against his will, Simon had to tremble in the sense of terrible immorality.Meilyn is my friend. It is a sin itself to have unscrupulous thoughts of my friend. I need to somehow regain my reason.Simon moved the firewood and desperately focused on doing something else.Rustle.Meilyn wiped her wet body with a towel and finally changed into clean, new underwear. After she wrapped her body tight in Simon\u2019s robes and fastened the buttons, she could breathe out a long sigh of relief.She slowly approached Simon, who had stiffened up.\u201cHuff.\u201dThen, she sat right next to Simon as he warmed himself up by the bonfire.Simon glanced a little to the side, and when he saw her white legs exposed through the robe, he turned his head away in fright.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dMeilyn giggled and poked Simon\u2019s forearm.\u201cWhy are you being more nervous than me? You idiot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not nervous.\u201dAfter letting out a scoff, she pulled her legs up to her chest and hugged them tight. A calm silence flew between the two of them for a while.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry?\u201dSimon stood up.He stirred the pot boiling on the campfire with a ladle, then served the piping hot soup to Meilyn in a small dish.\u201cIt\u2019s a meat soup.\u201dIt was a soup made according to Hong Feng\u2019s recipe.Her eyes widened. She had never imagined that she\u2019d ever see proper food like this on this island.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dMeilyn happened to be really hungry. She grabbed a spoon and took a careful bite.\u2018Woah!It really tasted the same as the one she ate at Hong Feng\u2019s hut.She continued to scoop up a second spoonful and then a third. Simon proudly watched her eating.\u201cSimon.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dShe put down the empty dish and replied with a blushing and coy face,\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you. For saving me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dShe put her face on her lap and gave Simon a vacant look.\u201cBut why did you save me? To be honest, I deserve to be abandoned. I attacked first, you know.\u201dSimon made an expression as though questioning why she was asking something so obvious.\u201cYou did the same. You didn\u2019t really mean to eliminate me either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSomething like that. I can\u2019t throw away the groupmate who\u2019ll be with me for the whole first semester because of a trivial problem.\u201dSimon grinned and held out his fist.\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201dShe smiled embarrassedly and bumped Simon\u2019s fist.\u201cUgh\u2026 This won\u2019t do after all!\u201d\u201cIs something off?\u201dInstead of answering, she raised her right arm where she wore the tongue pad.She spread out a magic circle with jet-black, entered a command, and overlaid it on her tongue pad.\u2018Wait, that command is\u2026\u2026\u2019Simon also knew all the commands of the tongue pad.Meilyn\u2019s tongue pad opened wide like a mouth, and the tongue rose more than a few meters.She pulled out the green sphere the tongue had wrapped around. It was a huge chunk of points.\u201cMeilyn, what are you\u2014!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by what? I can\u2019t handle this sting in my conscience. Take the payment for saving me!\u201dThe two got tangled up and argued about receiving and not receiving it.Meilyn forcefully brought the sphere to Simon\u2019s tongue pad, who ate it without hesitation.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe number on the tongue pad has risen significantly. When he checked, it had gone up to 260 when before it was 127.Simon suddenly jumped up.\u201cJust how much did you give me?\u201d\u201cAll but 1 point.\u201dShe said while eating the soup, giving a nonchalant wave.\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I should\u2019ve been eliminated there.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2026 Aren\u2019t you aiming for 1st place in this evaluation too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe stared at the bonfire in silence, and after a while, gave him a grin.\u201cHmph, of course! We still have two more days, right? If I hunt only the named ones, I can still aim for number one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201dNaturally, the mood loosened up, and the two of them finished the meat soup, not leaving even a scrap behind.It was still raining outside the cave, and past the bonfire was a cliff. Still, the view was great. You could see the whole island at a glance.\u2018It\u2019s warm.\u2019The more she thought about it, she thought that Simon really found a good place. As she felt relieved and full, a pleasant languor ran through her body.\u201cMeilyn.\u201dThen Simon spoke to her.\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a perverted question, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201dSimon hesitated a little, then said,\u201cWhy are you so obsessed with being number 1?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe wordless eyes that were looking outside the cave became fierce.\u201cThere\u2019s someone that I want to beat no matter what.\u201d\u201cThat person you\u2019re talking about must be\u2026 Serene Aindark, the Special Admission No.2. Am I right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn\u2019s reaction towards Serene was very sensitive.He remembered that the mood became bloody after mentioning the name Serene the day they first formed a group.Also, when Hector called her \u201cSerene\u2019s underling\u201d, she threw herself at Hector, intending to actually burn him to a crisp.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dShe nodded her head in approval.Releasing her tight grip around her legs, she leant back, supporting herself with her hands.\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never told anyone in Kizen, but I was the official successor of the Ivory Tower.\u201dIt was Meilyn, not Serene? Simon had never heard of this.\u201cI heard that it was decided that way since I was little. So, I have a memory of being high-spirited, since people from the Ivory tower family spoiled me. At that time, I didn\u2019t know how heavy the position of being an official successor was, and it was just fun seeing adults bowing their heads to me. I was immature. Then, one day, the Lord of the Ivory Tower brought in a newly adopted daughter.\u201dSimon quickly connected the dots and said,\u201cSo that adopted daughter was Serene, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. She was the same age as me, and clearly, she was a child who was brought to be my antipode. Of course, the reaction of the people of the Tower wasn\u2019t good, asking why they adopted a daughter all of a sudden, saying the motives were obvious, so on and so forth. My position as successor seemed solid, as she wasn\u2019t even a daughter born of a concubine, just an adopted daughter without any legitimacy. However\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was tension at the end of her words.\u201cSerene was a genius. No, a monster. The word \u2018genius\u2019 isn\u2019t enough to describe her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShe completed the jet-black modification that took me almost half a year, in a week. It\u2019s said that she understood any theory no matter how difficult it was, and she could know a hundred things after listening to one. Blood is also important in Ivory Tower, but\u2026\u2026 any problem was meaningless in front of Serene\u2019s talent. Before everyone realized it, regardless of faction or family, the whole Ivory Tower was filled with anticipation. That someday, the Ivory Tower would be able to regain its former glory the moment Serene grew up and became its lord. And I\u2026\u2026\u201dShe smiled bitterly.\u201cI was placed on the back burner. Adults constantly compared Serene and me. I always played the role of the idiot who made Serene shine, and I was only called out to public places to be embarrassed. By the time I grew up and came to my senses\u2026\u2026\u201dMeilyn shrugged.\u201cI was, of course, dumped. The elders even revised the Tower\u2019s law just to make Serene the official successor. Since that day, the way people looked at me completely changed. From the elders of the family, servants, friends, and even parents. Everyone gave up their expectations of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we turned 17, and because of the pact we made with Kizen, Serene happened to go to Kizen to study as a special admission. So I took the entrance exam on my own and entered Kizen too.\u201dNow Simon could understand everything.That was why she was so obsessed with becoming number one despite not getting enough sleep and working like crazy.It was to overcome Serene. To gain the approval of her family once more.In fact, Meilyn attacking him felt senseless at the time, but he was convinced after he heard her story.Simon was a Special Admission No.1. A person that pushed her target, Serene, to No 2.Of course, Simon had only recently started learning dark magic. There was an incomparably huge gap between him and Serene. The difference between No.1 and No.2 wasn\u2019t determined by a difference in skill.Still, Meilyn would\u2019ve been burning with a competitive spirit. Curious as to if defeating Simon would get her to Serene, too.\u201cI won\u2019t give up even if it kills me.\u201dShe clenched her fists.\u201cEveryone says it\u2019s impossible, but one day I\u2019ll take back what I lost. Without a doubt.\u201dSimon gave a wide grin.\u201cIf it\u2019s you, it\u2019s definitely possible. I\u2019ll cheer for you, Meilyn.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dShe snorted, but as if she felt good deep inside, an arc was drawn on her lips.\u201cYou know that all 961 first-year students entered the Island Survival assessment this time, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSerene is also on this island. If you meet her, avoid her at all costs. I\u2019m speaking as someone who has been watching her from the side for several years, but the more I look at her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s\u2026\u201dMeilyn\u2019s expression became serious.\u201c\u2026human.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85The sun started to rise.Meilyn, who was lying on the ground with Simon\u2019s robe covering her like a blanket, sat up with a groan.After taking a moment to collect herself, she glanced around the cave.\u201c\u2026\u2026Simon?\u201dSimon was nowhere to be seen.All that remained was a bonfire with red embers lying dormant inside and fruits scattered around it. She saw a note from Simon along with a kebab-like thing that was ready to grill.<Sorry, for personal reasons, I\u2019m leaving first.>She made a sour face after reading the note.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmph. It\u2019s not like I wanted to team up with you either.\u201dAfter saying that out loud for no reason, she pouted and ignited the bonfire\u2019s flames.\u2018Be careful, Simon.\u2019* * *\u201cDammit! Dammit! Dammit!\u201dAt the same time, Haren Cork and his team were scouring the jungle.\u2018Where did that bastard go?\u2019Haren, who saw Simon enter Kera Island from across the bridge, chased after him immediately, but eventually lost him in the complex and dense jungle environment and the monster attacks.It wasn\u2019t really a good situation.Luckily, he was able to get a chance from \u2018them\u2019, but at this rate, he may have to go back to Kizen empty handed.\u2018Tsk.\u2019Haren put his hand in his inner pocket and fiddled with the feathers. He already used two of the five.He scratched his head angrily and looked back.\u201cHey, what are you doing? Find harder, bastard!\u201d\u201cY-Yeah! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201dWith his nose on the floor and pretending to sniff, the male student couldn\u2019t even dare make eye contact with Haren.The other team members who watched this happen were very confused about the situation.That was because\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026Why can\u2019t Malcolm do anything against that loser?\u2019The student sniffing the ground was none other than that Special Admission No.1, Malcolm Randolph, who won even against Hector.All the team members here saw Malcolm and followed him. Haren was no exception, coming here due to Malcolm\u2019s power and strength.But at some point, there seemed to be a sudden change in the master-slave dynamic.Haren didn\u2019t even lead the team to the center. He was just wandering around the forest, saying that he needed to find Simon Polentia, the Special Admission No.1\u201cWait, Haren.\u201dUnable to bear it anymore, a female student approached Haren.\u201cHow long are we gonna do this? It\u2019s already the third day. It\u2019ll be dangerous if we don\u2019t make it to the mansion now. The entire central island will soon be a battleground!\u201dHaren picked at his ears.\u201cYou\u2019ve been damn noisy since a while ago. If you don\u2019t like it, get out of my team.\u201d\u201cYour team? Since when was this your team? The leader of this team is Malcolm!\u201d\u201cAh, is that so?\u201dMalcolm smiled perversely and looked behind him.\u201cWhat do you think, Malcolm?\u201dAs soon as Haren asked\u2026Thud!Malcolm lay face down, forehead planted on the ground and butt sticking up into the air.\u201cObviously you\u2019re the leader, Haren! You\u2019re our only leader!\u201d\u201cAhaha!\u201dSeeing Malcolm\u2019s unusual attitude, the female student bit at her lip.\u2018Something\u2019s odd, no matter how much I think about it.\u2019Her name was Amelie. She was in the same Class M as Malcolm, and she was also his group member.It was unimaginable that Malcolm, someone with great pride and a competitive spirit, would show such an attitude.\u201cTell me honestly, you did something to Malcolm, didn\u2019t you?\u201dAt Amelie\u2019s question, Haren just shrugged.\u201cWhat kind of rubbish are you talking about? You think I did this? He\u2019s just doing that because he likes me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201dShe activated her core and readied her hands. A magic circle was drawn in her palms in an instant.\u201cTurn Malcolm back right now!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 This is ridiculous.\u201dHaren scoffed.\u201cHey, have some common sense. Is there any dark magic that brings your opponents to their knees? Well, maybe, but could a first-year student use such a powerful mind-control spell?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo one could refute those words, not even Amelie.Things such as saying Haren must\u2019ve used some kind of trick, or that he robbed Malcolm of his spot. It was all nothing but speculation. The most frustrating part was that Malcolm himself, the one surrendering the position, didn\u2019t give any explanation.\u2018But that woman\u2026 It\u2019s annoying that she keeps following around and being grumpy about it.\u2019\u201cAlright, sure. I\u2019ll give you a hint.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t tell others, alright? Come here.\u201dWhen Haren beckoned her over, she became quite alert.\u201cAmelie, don\u2019t go!\u201dSaid a male student standing behind Amelie.\u201cI don\u2019t know what did it, but Malcolm is gone. It\u2019d be better to separate with these guys, even now\u2014\u201d\u201cNah, I\u2019ll go.\u201dAmelie strode closer to Haren.She needed to know the nature of the curse placed on Malcolm. It\u2019d be better if he tried to use that power on her.Amelie had a rare constitution among Necromancers, one which prevented curses from working on her.If he placed a curse on her, she could analyze it using that. And if something went wrong, she had five allies behind her.As Amelie approached Haren, he gave a sly smile.\u201cGet a little bit closer. As I said, the others shouldn\u2019t listen to this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer irritation was bubbling within her, but she had to endure it to save Malcolm.Amelie closed her eyes tight and came close to Haren. Then, Haren grabbed her by the shoulder.\u201cKyah!\u201d\u201cAmelie!\u201dThe male student watching this happen immediately drew his jet-black sword.But nothing he was expecting really happened. Haren really did only whisper a few words in her ear, and she nodded her head before stepping back.\u201cYaaaawwwwwnnnn, I\u2019m so bored.\u201dSaid Haren before looking at Amelie.\u201cHey, woman. Sit like a dog.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026!!\u201dAt those words, fury filled the faces of the surrounding teammates.\u201cYou bastard! You just crossed the\u2014!\u201dHowever, Amelie really did squat on the spot, sticking out her tongue like a dog. Everyone\u2019s faces turned pale.\u201cWhat did I do? She\u2019s just doing what I\u2019m telling her to.\u201dHaren shrugged and giggled.\u201cNow, try dancing for me this time.\u201d\u201cAmelie! Don\u2019t do it!\u201dAs Amelie stood up to really do it, one of her teammates grabbed the back of her arm.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?! Please, come to your senses!\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dHaren held his sides with laughter.\u201cThis is fucking comedy! It\u2019s hilarious!\u201d\u201cHareeeeeeeen!\u201dIn the end, the male student couldn\u2019t hold it back and grabbed his jet-black sword,\u00a0 rushing toward Haren.Whack!A rod flew in from the side, smashed the male student\u2019s face, and blew him away. The other students stepped back, their nerves clear on their faces.\u201cOh my, maybe you forgot who\u2019s by my side.\u201dNext to Haren saying that stood Malcolm ready to fight, moving his rod with vicious force.\u201cMeh, I don\u2019t want to use more feathers, and they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d listen.\u201dHaren gestured at them.\u201cJust get rid of everyone, Malcolm.\u201dAt those words, Malcolm rushed in like a demon.It didn\u2019t take long for all the remaining students to be left lying on the floor.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *Meanwhile.Simon returned to the very spot where he fought Meilyn, looking for clues. But nothing could be found.\u2018Why did Big Krum appear specifically then?\u2019Simon was thinking about the battle with Meilyn.Was he provoked by the noise from a fierce fight? But to think of it that way, the whole island was in battle.Was he only sensitive to fire? That was also a bit obscure.\u2018Pier, do you have any ideas?\u2019[\u2026\u2026]The talkative Pier had barely said a word after seeing Big Krum.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d[Mm. Nah, it\u2019s nothing. If I had to think of something, the biggest reason why Big Krum grows bigger is Fury. In other words\u2026]\u2018You\u2019re saying he might be hostile to me, right?\u2019Simon crossed his arms.If Krum was hostile, he thought for a moment that it might be a similar case to Elizabeth, who had a grudge against the Legion.But that didn\u2019t quite track either. Big Krum was so loyal to the Legion that he sacrificed himself.[By the way,]Pier\u2019s clone opened his mouth.[I\u2019d have to go out of the subspace and check to know for sure, but the atmosphere of that guy was a bit different from the Big Krum I knew.]\u2018Mm.\u2019[You better be careful, Boy. I have a bad feeling about this.]\u2018Okay. Let\u2019s search carefully as we get closer to the center.\u2019Simon moved forward without hesitation.As he moved toward the center, the frequency of monster appearances certainly decreased, but traces of Kizen students appeared with more and more regularity.It was the third day now.Since all the students had lots of points stored in their tongue pads, it reached the point where it was easier to rank high by hunting students instead of hunting any monsters.Splash.Simon stopped in his tracks. The source of the noise very quickly went quiet.As Simon nervously looked around, he saw someone hiding behind a tree.\u2018\u2026\u2026What is that?\u2019Someone was hiding behind a tree, but Simon could see their hands. It looked like they were holding it.He wondered what the point of hiding was if they were doing that.\u201cIf you\u2019re here for me, then come out.\u201dThen, the person who\u2019d been hiding behind the tree stepped into view.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing their face, Simon\u2019s face turned pale, and eventually went white.Although she wore a Kizen school uniform, her face was one that couldn\u2019t appear in this situation. No, she shouldn\u2019t have been here at all.\u201cWhy\u2026 are you here\u2026?\u201dThe expelled student from Efnel who he met on a mission.Ellen Zile.She was waving her hand while smiling.As Simon took a step closer, she quickly turned her back and ran into the woods.\u201cWait!\u201dSimon hurriedly chased after her. When Simon followed her into the depths of the forest, gasping for air, Ellen was squatting, looking at a flower in full bloom on the ground.As Simon approached, she gave a smile and ran away again.\u2018Who in the world is pulling this kind of prank?!\u2019His head was spinning. He could tell from a glance that she wasn\u2019t the real Ellen, but he couldn\u2019t help but chase her.Ellen climbed up trees, danced like a ballerina, and even put her hands together and prayed.No matter how much Simon ran, he couldn\u2019t catch up with her.And finally\u2026\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dHe reached an open space in the forest.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhat he saw in front of him was a tragedy.Nearly 20 Kizen students were crawling on the ground, screaming in pain.\u201cH-Hel\u2014!\u201dSmash!A blood-red spear fell from the tree and pierced through the student\u2019s body. He fell limp as he screamed as though he really had been pierced by a spear.Soon after, force teleportation occurred, leaving only the lump of mana spat out by the tongue pad.Stab! Smash! Thud!A scene resembling the Holy Federation\u2019s depictions of hell unfolded before him. Screams resounded like a harmony.Nearly twenty students got knocked out without even being able to lift a finger. The students disappeared one by one, leaving only the mass of mana left by the tongue pads.\u201cStop! Stop it!\u201dOne student shouted to the sky,\u201cWhy are you doing this to us?! What wrong did we do to deserve this?!\u201dAt that moment, his tight chains wrapped around his body and fixed him to a frame.That frame was a bloodstained cross. During the Hundred Years\u2019 War, Efnel would kill a Necromancer by crucifying them on a red cross.A symbol of death.The cross ascended into the sky, and the sharp spears waiting in the air thrust into him.Terror filled the student\u2019s eyes as he cried out, a mixture of tears and snot running down his face.\u201cStooooooooooooooooop!\u201dStab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!Countless spears stabbed into him, and his body went limp. The barrier of the protective suit disappeared, and forced teleportation occurred.At the last minute, Simon saw a feather fly out and touch the student\u2019s forehead.The students who still survived were struggling on the ground. Then, they too were caught by chains, this time being tied to huge guillotines, their necks fixed in place.\u201cStop! Stop! Please!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do anything! Please, save m\u2014!\u201dThe guillotine fell without a second of mercy, and the screams fell silent.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon looked at that scene with a cold expression. Then, he raised his head.A person seen only as a silhouette in the darkness sat comfortably on a tree and enjoyed the sight. It was as though they were watching a show.\u201cThey\u2019re all just massive crybabies.\u201dFrom the darkness, a beautiful voice resounded.\u201cThey\u2019re all wearing protective suits, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re really dying anyway. Plus, I\u2019ll wipe their memories when they go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s fist tightened.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201dIn the dark, the ivory-haired girl smiled eerily.\u201c\u2026\u2026For fun?\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Fun.Many thoughts flashed across Simon\u2019s mind.He wondered if it was actually fun toying with people like that, or if she was just doing that to shake him up.\u201cWhy did you call me here, Serene Aindark?\u201dAt those words, the girl sitting on the tree came down gently. It was as though gravity itself weakened for her. Even her movements were slow.Platinum hair, ideally positioned facial features, and a unique aura able to overwhelm people like Lorain. The spirit of the monarch.She hadn\u2019t changed. Just like when he met her on the teleportation circle, she still exerted pressure on those around her.\u201cIt\u2019s because I wanted to talk to you.\u201dA soft voice. Simon thought it was the first time in his life that he had heard such a pleasant voice.But contrary to the ears\u2019 delight, the brain was frantically ringing alarm bells as goosebumps worked their way up his skin.\u201cGet straight to the point.\u201dSpat out Simon.\u201cThis is the third time we\u2019ve met~ They say it\u2019s fate if you run into each other three times.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t agree. Well, it\u2019s fine.\u201dShe had a different atmosphere compared to when he first met her.If she felt like a wealthy, well-educated, polite lady back then, she now felt like a cunning little devil. Simon thought that this was closer to her true nature.She clasped her hands behind her back and turned around.\u201cSimon Polentia, no, shall I call you this\u2026\u201dA creepy smile crept across her lips.\u201cCommander of the Seventh Legion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dBa-bump. Ba-bump. Ba-bump.His heart started beating wildly.\u201cIs Pier doing well? It looks like Elizabeth isn\u2019t with you. Or perhaps she\u2019s transformed into someone else on this island.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon\u2019s important secrets, ones that should never be revealed, spilled out from her lips.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh~ Don\u2019t worry. I created a barrier, so there\u2019s no room for observers to peek in or overhear us.\u201dExcuses wouldn\u2019t work against someone who already knew too much, and so he said,\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201dShe smiled softly as though telling him not to rush\u201cI shall tell you, since I like your attitude in admitting it right away. Do you remember where we met for the second time?\u201d\u201cIt was on the teleportation circle before leaving for our missions.\u201d\u201cAt that time, the only first-year students heading to the Kallos Kingdom were you and me, just the two of us.\u201dShe lightly put her palms together.\u201cDon\u2019t you think something is strange?\u201dSimon bit his lip.\u201cSo you\u2019ve been watching me ever since.\u201d\u201cYeah, actually way before that.\u201dShe closed her eyes and pretended to tap the air with her fingers.\u201cKizen\u2019s top secret. The Ivory tower has been observing the ruins sealed by Nefthis. I personally installed the alarm spell that activates when the ruins are opened, and after a few days, the alarm sounded. When I hurried over to the place, my goodness.\u201dShe smiled.\u201cYou became the Commander of the Legion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo it was from then. Simon\u2019s head started to spin.\u201cThen, how did you find out about Elizabeth?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious too? When we teleported together, I also stopped by Arnish to watch over you. I read the memories of the Lord of Arnish, the guard captain, the soldiers, the Thieves\u2019 Guild members, the dancers, and\u2026\u201dA smirk formed across her mouth.\u201cEllen Zile, who you let go of. You know this is a pretty dangerous crime, right? Letting a Priest live.\u201dThe pressure started to form a choking grip around his throat, but he somehow forced a smile.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ellen, at that time, was an individual without any affiliation. We\u2019re under a flag of truce right now. Therefore, I just took the measure under the treaty of the captives and released her rather than causing trouble by killing innocent residents of the Holy Federation.\u201d\u201cHm~ You\u2019re a pretty smooth talker. Well, I guess there\u2019s no point in bringing up such a trivial matter to you, huh?\u201dShe laughed.\u201cSince you\u2019re a criminal of first-class treason.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you know that the moment you signed a contract with Pier\u2019s Legion, who rebelled against the Dark Alliance, you\u2019d also be accused of treason? It\u2019s a serious matter, so much so that it wouldn\u2019t be strange if the test ceased right now and the Crows of Kizen from all over the continent rushed in here.\u201dSimon slowly rubbed his forehead.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m dumbfounded.\u201d\u201cAre you going to make more excuses?\u201d\u201cIf you know all that, then report it to Kizen and bring it to trial. Why are you telling me like this?\u201d\u201cNow it seems like it\u2019s time to bring out the main point.\u201dA bright spark filled her eyes.\u201cJoin the Ivory Tower, Simon.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA sudden offer to join the Ivory Tower?Simon felt that things were flowing strangely.A little bit more.Let\u2019s lure her out a little bit more.\u201cIf you want to scout me, then you could join the formal recruiting battle after I graduate. I don\u2019t think the Ivory Tower\u2019s wealth and power are lacking to be pushed back in the recruitment battle, though.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want a Kizen person who graduated from Kizen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you mean?\u201dShe grinned.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious? As to why a single school organization is ruling half the continent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, Simon did wonder why.\u201cLet\u2019s take the nearby Dresden Kingdom as an example.\u201dShe started to count something on her fingers.\u201c4 out of 5 generals in Dresden are from Kizen. 17 out of 20 members of the Royal Knights are from Kizen. Their Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense, and even\u2026\u201dShe folded all her fingers and clasped her hands behind her back.\u201cEven the second-in-command, the Prime Minister, is from Kizen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you understand now? The people who hold power in the alliance are all allies calling each other seniors and juniors. They\u2019re proud of the fact that they graduated from Kizen, forming some sort of cartel. They\u2019re more loyal to Kizen than the state or organization that pays them and gives them power.\u201dIncluding Dresden, most of the countries in the Dark Alliance were like this. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that almost all key positions were occupied by \u2018Kizens\u2019 or their agents, except for the lone royal families left to keep an eye on the \u2018Kizen Cartel\u2019.Kizen held talent in their hands.But in terms of ability, the work competency of Kizen graduates was at a transcendental level. Countries couldn\u2019t put just anyone in key positions. To gain a stronger stand in the Dark Alliance, it was essential to have talents from Kizen.\u201cAlright. So the reason why you\u2019re bringing this up is\u2026\u201dSimon raised his head and looked at her.\u201cYou need someone who\u2019s free from Kizen\u2019s influence, someone loyal only to the Ivory Tower.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re smart, as I expected. It\u2019s nice that you understood so easily.\u201dShe wanted a pure member of Ivory Tower, not a Kizen graduate belonging to the Ivory Tower.Simon could understand.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have a choice here.\u201dSerene smiled softly.\u201cIt\u2019s either you get executed for treason or you join the Ivory Tower. But still, I\u2019m offering you a top-notch job, and it\u2019s pretty good in its own way, you know? Your classmate Meilyn is here, and you can have as much power or money as you want.\u201d\u201cI have only one question.\u201dSaid Simon in a serious voice.\u201cDo you just need my strength, or do you need the strength of the Legion?\u201dShe grinned.\u201cI\u2019ll say both. As a courtesy.\u201d\u201cWhat worries me is\u2026\u201dSimon bit his lip.\u201cI can\u2019t trust you guys yet. How can you prove that I won\u2019t lose my Legion after joining the Ivory Tower?\u201dShe blinked.\u201cYour self-esteem is lower than I thought~ I don\u2019t think you have to worry about that if you prove your abilities.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll promise as a successor that you can keep the Legion as yours if you join the Ivory Tower. So please answer me now, Simon Polentia.\u201dPhewwwwwwww.Simon let out a long breath.He was getting too caught up in her rhythm.He had to bring it to his own tune.As he took a deep breath and operated his jet-black, the trembling in his body stopped little by little, and all his trivial thoughts flew away.Finally, after cooling his head, Simon looked at her with a cold gaze.\u2018His atmosphere changed.\u2019She also sensed Simon\u2019s change. But she knew calming down wouldn\u2019t make his situation any better.\u201cSerene. You\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon smirked.\u201cYou\u2019re bad at playing politics, aren\u2019t you?\u201dSerene creased her brow\u201cAnd what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cThreatening people after showing all your cards? That\u2019s not a good habit.\u201dSerene had been the strong one since birth.She didn\u2019t have to be complicated.When she requested something, there were two options:Yes or No.Life or Death.No one was free from her ultimatums. Hiding your cards was for the weak.Therefore\u2026\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to let Kizen know that I\u2019m the Commander of the Legion.\u201dThis time, she made a mistake.\u201cOh my. Why do you think that?\u201d\u201cBecause you want to be free from Kizen no matter what.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFor the first time, she didn\u2019t respond.\u201cActually, I\u2019ve heard something. That the inside of the Ivory Tower is divided into pro-Kizen and anti-Kizen.\u201cOh, to talk about the internal politics of the tower. You must have a really good network of information~ I doubt Meilyn dumb enough to share stories of the inside.\u201dThe truth was, it was just something Rick said idly while he was eating, though.\u201cYou and the current lord of the Ivory Tower are representatives of the anti-Kizens. The reason why you want to gather the commanders and become stronger must be\u2026\u201dSimon put his hand to his hips.\u201cBecause you want to be independent of Kizen, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ll inform Kizen that I\u2019m a Commander and execute me? I wonder who\u2019ll take over my Legion then.\u201dSimon\u2019s smirk widened.\u201cA more powerful Necromancer who\u2019s absolutely loyal to Kizen will become a Commander. If that happens, your independence will only drift further. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s possible for you to kidnap me and transplant the Legion to a necromancer from the Ivory Tower.\u201dSimon folded his arms and continued.\u201cBecause that\u2019s a declaration of war against Kizen.\u201dThe kidnapping of a Special Admission No.1, a Special Admission No.1 who was actually a Commander, and killing him to take over the Legion.If such a thing happened, Nefthis would not leave even a speck of dust standing once she was done with the Ivory Tower.Historically, she has been quite ruthless on these kinds of issues, after all.\u201cYou know only one side of the story.\u201dSerene smiled brightly.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t there be an option like this? I\u2019ll remove you and bury you so that no one acquires the Legion.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dSimon chuckled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that won\u2019t work.\u201dSimon pulled the virtual lever and opened the subspace.[Kuahahahahahahaha!]Serene paused a little and took a step back.A tall skeleton stood wearing a shadowless cloak. The ancient undead Pier. He had revealed himself from the subspace.After him, Elizabeth\u2019s corpse spiders and skeletons with dark blue flames burning in their eye sockets poured out like demons from another dimension.\u2018Why is Pier here?\u2019Serene bit at her bottom lip.\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure Kizen conducted a subspace inspection.\u2019\u201cAnd you said that observers can\u2019t see inside your barrier, right?\u201dSimon smirk broke out into a grin.\u201cThat\u2019s also a mistake.\u201dRattle!Rattle!Ssssssshhhhhhhk!The soldiers of the Legion surrounded Serene, crying out as their fighting spirit blazed.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87\u201cHmm.\u201dSerene smiled.The Legion\u2019s skeletons and corpse spiders surrounded her. She was overwhelmingly outnumbered, 27 to 1, but she was maintaining a perfect composure.\u201cWell, this is pretty entertaining. I shall play with you, Commander.\u201dShe stretched out her long, slender index finger.Rustle.At the tip of her finger, a foreign white feather rose up. Simon paid close attention to it as he watched her every move.\u2018So that\u2019s Serene\u2019s unique ability.\u2019A power that only a few chosen beings on this continent could obtain.A \u2018supernatural ability\u2019 that wasn\u2019t dark magic, divine magic, nor pure magic. It was on a whole different level from the Black Hand used by Haren Cork. She gingerly took the feather into her hand and threw it.\u2018It\u2019s fast!\u2019Simon clenched his teeth, drew out a short sword, and swung.Clang!Even though it was iron against a feather, the iron was the one that broke. Then, as though it managed to change its course, the feather lightly grazed Simon\u2019s cheek before thudding into the tree behind him.Ba-thump!In that brief moment, Simon felt a pain burning worse than the fires of hell before returning to reality.Although it was for less than 1 second, his organs still released endorphins to produce a pain-killing effect.\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019A cold sweat dripped from Simon\u2019s back.\u201cThis is my power. I can put feelings into this feather.\u201dSimon looked back.The tree where the feather embedded itself was twisting its branches. As though it was feeling like a pest was eating it, its stem was synthesizing pest-repelling substances and creating an odor to attract the pests\u2019 natural enemy.Simon could smell a sour tree sap. If plants would react this much\u2026\u201cAnything is possible, from primary emotions like joy, anger, and pleasure to things like fear, pressure, and lethargy.\u201dSix new feathers danced on the top of her hand.\u201cIf the opponent is a human, I can make them crawl like a dog with just one feather. Would you like to see it?\u201dA full-fledged offense began.Feathers flew at a savage speed, and Simon jumped away in fright to dodge, a loud sound ringing out every time her feathers hit the ground.Rustle!Another set of feathers bloomed from her fingertips, and she took hold of them. These ones were dyed black, and they shot out at a speed more than twice that of the previous ones.The black feathers were reflected in Simon\u2019s eyes, who had just fallen to the ground.Thud!At that moment, Pier, jumping in front of Simon, slashed the feathers with his greatsword.[Kuhehe! Are you alright?]\u201cThe reaction speed of the ancient undead really is scary~\u201dMuttered Serene. Pier grabbed the pure-white greatsword.[What are you gonna do now, Boy?]Simon stood up with a serious face.\u201cI\u2019ll fight.\u201dAs soon as the last word left Simon\u2019s mouth, Pier shot forward like an arrow.Serene grinned and threw a feather.Pier\u2019s body blinked out of existence as he fired himself up before suddenly changing direction mid-air into a downwards arc. Using her opposite hand, Serene lifted a feather above her head and into the path of the attack.Ccccccrrrrrrash!The sword and the feather collided, releasing violent sparks. In the blink of an eye, the feather had transformed into a defensive magic circle.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around thoughtlessly, but I didn\u2019t expect to be dealing with an ancient undead here, you know?\u201d[Hmph!]Fierce flames erupted in Pier\u2019s eyes.Pier\u2019s greatsword tore through the defense magic, and Serene stepped back, taking it as an opportunity.\u2018Webs!\u2019As Simon focussed his eyes, the corpse spiders scattered all over the place fired their webs at once.She leisurely folded her hands behind her back and dodged them with soft steps as though she was slightly floating in the air.\u2018Spear soldiers, forward!\u2019Whoooooosh!Skeletons lurking in the grass thrust their spears. Five spears charged toward Serene, but she ducked underneath all of them, pressing herself against the ground.\u201cHow cumbersome.\u201dThuthuthuthuthud!Feathers bloomed from her body and smashed all the skeletons around her. However, when she got back up again, a rain of slashes from Pier fell upon her.Claclaclaclaclaclaclaclaclang!A precise combo attack leaves no gaps.In front of and behind Serene, who fled to the air to avoid the fierce attack, corpse spiders swung like pendulums at her. Seeing this, she swiftly fired feathers to shoot down the spiders, bringing herself higher into the air.\u2018As expected, it\u2019s not just about putting emotions on feathers.\u2019Simon, who was observing, bit his lip.\u201cA Commander is in a different league after all, huh?\u201dSerene waved her hand like a conductor. The body of feathers fluttering in the wind collapsed back into jet-black, which transformed into a magic circle.A multi-cast of more than twenty, a feat that even active Necromancers would find astonishing. For her, it was as easy as the wave of a hand.Each feather was a means of attack, a carrier of emotions, and a magic circle.She smiled as she raised twenty magic circles.\u201cDark Flare.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dBababababababang!Twenty dark flames erupted from the magic circles and turned the ground into a wasteland. The bodies of skeletons and corpse spiders alike were swept away by the overwhelming firepower, not standing a chance.Thump!Simon avoided a direct hit by a hair\u2019s breadth, but more than half of his Barrier Gauge was blown away.\u2018\u2026\u2026That\u2019s all Dark Flare? That doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u2019The Special Admission No.2, Serene Aindark, was already far beyond the level of a student.[Quite lukewarm.]It was then. Pier, who flew into the sky, appeared behind Serene\u2019s back.Slaaaaaaaaaam!Her body crashed to the ground. Pier, moving fast enough to come down to the ground and wait for her to fall, swung his greatsword.Bang!Serene transformed a feather into a shield and blocked it, but Pier continued his fierce offense.\u201cKugh!\u201dDefending every attack at the sacrifice of many of her feathers, Serene stepped back and spread out her palms.The remaining feathers fluttering in the air turned into new dark magic circles surrounding Pier.[Pheeeew!]Pier\u2019s eyes sparkled.The pure-white greatsword turned into a single line, leaving countless sword paths in the air. Soon, every last magic circle was torn apart.[Certainly, you have surpassed the level of a student!]Pier kicked off the ground and jumped.[But that\u2019s just the level of a student!!]A pure-white sword came down with enough force to split Serene\u2019s head in two.Shk.\u201cGotcha.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 RamenProofreader \u2013 Artethrax* * *The greatsword stopped a mere whisker away. Twenty feathers embedded themselves all over Pier\u2019s body.\u201cWhile inducing you to attack, I readied the feathers I set up on the ground beforehand.\u201dShe approached Pier with light steps and tapped his skull with her finger.But Pier didn\u2019t in any way react.\u201cTwenty feathers of lethargy. Originally, my powers wouldn\u2019t have worked against the undead, but good thing that it\u2019s an ancient undead. Since it has existed for a long time, it\u2019s an existence that thinks and feels like a human being.\u201dShe turned to look at Simon.\u201cWell~ Commander? Your best hand is now sealed off. Now\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon grinned.\u201cYou wish.\u201d[Hehe! Kehehehehe!]Hearing Pier\u2019s laughter, Serene turned around.The feathers attached to Pier\u2019s body were falling off.[Certainly, emotions do exist on me, Girl! But my will isn\u2019t that weak!]Rrrrrrrumble!As though Pier\u2019s body was about to explode, dark-blue jet-black soared up.[To be shaken?! By this?!!]Pier, who broke through Serene\u2019s power with his own will, held his greatsword in a firm grip.Serene quickly stepped back and sent out feathers to unfold a defensive magic circle.[I shall not go easy on you anymore! Die!]Pier\u2019s greatsword scattered light in all directions.<Savage Slash>Slaaaaaaaaaaam!The slash cut the world in half and caused a huge explosion. It was bigger than any of Pier\u2019s slashes that Simon had ever seen.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Trees and plants were being blown away in the fierce blast.Simon looked straight ahead, covering his face with his arms.\u2018\u2026\u2026Pier! We\u2019ll be in trouble if you really kill her! She\u2019s a successor of the Ivory Tower!\u2019[You\u2019re worrying over nothing.]Said Pier, carrying the greatsword on his shoulder.[It\u2019s more of a monster than you expect.]Crumble\u2026As Pier said, when the smoke cleared up, Serene appeared, standing.Simon was surprised. She had three wings on her left shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I revealed this form.\u201dIt was only on one side, too. There were no wings on the right.This was the true identity of her abilities. You could feel the wave of the jet-black that was on a whole different level to a while ago.\u2018Pier. Can you use that skill one more time?\u2019[Kuhehe! Of course!]\u2018If I get Serene\u2019s attention\u2026\u2026\u2019\u201cBy the way, are we\u2026\u201dSerene pointed behind herself.\u201cgoing to keep fighting like this?Simon\u2019s eyes widened.With Pier\u2019s slash just now, Serene\u2019s barrier had been broken. As the cracks started to run through the structure, the entire barrier began collapsing and cracking apart.That would be difficult. As the barrier began to break, they\u2019d enter the observers\u2019 sight.\u2018Crap, come back!\u2019Simon pulled the imaginary lever.The skeletons and corpse spiders of the Legion quickly returned to Simon\u2019s subspace.Perhaps Serene also thought that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to show her wings, so she hid them inside her body once more.\u2018Pier, get back in too.\u2019[Even me?]Pier hardened his face.[The problem here isn\u2019t about you getting caught! That woman\u2019s feather has the power to simply turn humans into cripples!]\u2018It\u2019s fine. I have an idea.\u2019Simon fiddled with the necklace artifact that Nefthis had given him, which he still wore around his neck.\u2018I\u2019ll leave the subspace open. For now, please go in, and if ever I fall into danger, please come out.\u2019[Mm, be careful.]Pier also entered the subspace, and Serene\u2019s barrier disappeared completely. Perhaps because the surroundings were completely devastated, observers began to wander in the sky.\u201cPhew.\u201dNow, only Simon and Serene remained. Simon fixed up and straightened his tie.\u201cAt this rate, the last option you mentioned is gone out the window, right?\u201dThe option of getting rid of Simon and hiding the Legion so that no one could obtain it was now impossible. After all, Kizen\u2019s eyes were wide open and observing them.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Then how about something like this.\u201dSerene pulled out one of the feathers and put it to her cheek.\u201cI\u2019ll play with you, bring you into a fit of rage, and then drive you out of the evaluation. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll erase your memory.\u201d\u201cHah.\u201dThe wind blew. A feather fluttered in the air toward Simon and fell to his feet.\u201cYou\u2019ll live a painful life in Kizen from now on.\u201dHer feather turned into a magic circle, and Simon could hear her voice.\u201cUnknown misfortunes will overlap. You\u2019ll fail the exam, screw up the performance assessment, and get expelled from Kizen, and when their protection ends, I\u2019ll come to visit you. What do you think? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a legal and clever way to persuade you?\u201dSimon scoffed and put his hand on his waist.\u201cHow persistent. You\u2019ve been doing that to other students till now, haven\u2019t you?\u201dShe just blinked with a smile on her face as though she didn\u2019t understand.It was obvious. Making the talented people who seemed like they would become main pillars of Kizen drop out of the school, and secretly scouting the discouraged students into the Ivory Tower.Sneaking out talented people.Of course, it\u2019d be a problem if she got caught, but she wouldn\u2019t care whether or not she got expelled from Kizen.According to Meilyn yesterday, Serene had to study here because of their pact with Kizen.Being a special admission was a huge privilege no matter what, but this situation was pretty awkward from a diplomatic point of view. A situation where a large organization like the Ivory Tower had to send its successor outside.To put it bluntly, it was like their prince or princess getting held hostage.Therefore, it was natural for her to dislike Kizen. Serene\u2019s goal was perhaps the complete independence of the Ivory Tower.\u2018It feels like I got myself into something complicated.\u2019Kizen wasn\u2019t just a school.It was an organization full of talented people who will dominate the Dark Alliance and the continent in the future.To lay the foundation for the continent, to draw a rough sketch for the future, various interests would be lurking in this school.He\u2019d be swayed by many struggles for power as time went on.What would be a smart choice at those times? It was like Simon was once again given a new task.\u201cSerene.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t give in to that way of yours.\u201dSimon slowly took a stance.\u201cYour method only increases the number of your enemies.\u201d\u201cWho do you think you\u2019re lecturing?\u201dSerene raised her arm. Twenty feathers formed, fluttering in the wind, and gathered at the center.\u201cI\u2019m the next Tower Lord of the Ivory Tower, a person who will divide the continent into three and usher in a new era.\u201dAs she pointed her finger, her feathers flew like bullets.In that moment when Simon tried to avoid it by stepping on jet-black\u2026Woosh!The air distorted, and someone stepped in, appearing in front of Simon.All that person did was the simple motion of swinging their arm.Paang!With that alone, the feathers that had rushed in with force, objects that could tear anything into shreds, disappeared without a trace.\u201cI think I heard something interesting just now~\u201dA feeling of intense pressure that would make one tremble just by hearing their voice.\u201cWho will get expelled from Kizen? Whose protection will end, again?\u201dBlack hair fluttering in the wind.Hair-raisingly red eyes, which were held wide open.\u201cI\u2019ll protect Simon, Dog of the Ivory Tower.\u201dA powerful candidate for the next president of Kizen, and a figure emerging as a new pillar of the Dark Alliance.Lorain had entered the battlefield.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88\"Is it time for you to appear now?\"Serene smiled softly. Lorain lightly ignored her and turned to Simon.\"You alright, Simon?\"Simon quickly came to his senses and answered,\"Ah, yes. The protective suit\u2014\"\"Not your body. How's your mind?\"Lorain knew of Serene's unique ability.\"It's okay. The feathers barely grazed me.\"Lorain nodded and stared straight ahead with a cold expression. There stood Serene, leaning slightly to the side with her hands on her hips.\"What is the meaning of all this, Serene?\"\"Oh, I'm just taking the assessment, you see.\"Lorain's expression became heavy as Serene calmly shrugged her shoulders.\"If you're just taking the assessment, why did you block off the observer's eyes with a barrier?\"\"Oh my, this is going too far.\"Serene raised her head.\"Are you interrogating me right now? With what right? We\u2019re both students here. You must be feeling like you\u2019re student president or something already.\"\"Stop changing the topic and answer the question.\"\"What if I don't want to?\"Lorain lowered her stance.\"Just as you said you were doing, I'll have to take the assessment, too.\"\"Interesting.\"\"Stand back, Simon.\"Simon obediently retreated, feeling as though dozens of lives wouldn't be enough to survive getting involved in the fight between those two.Lorain spread her palms, and jet-black flew out before collating into four magic circles hovering in the air.Soon, dark arrows were fired from the magic circles. However, upon seeing that, Serene just giggled.\"Jet-black arrows? How cute~ C'mon, let's not play between u\u2014\"Serene\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed and turned to look behind her.In a flash, Lorain had appeared behind Serene, a fist being flung as hard as possible.Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!A simple punch created a huge shock wave that spread out in all directions.A crater over several-dozen-meters wide formed around the point of impact.\"How scary.\"Serene flew into the air and smiled.As she smiled, her surroundings suddenly went dark, a shadow forming above her. And form above her it did, a giant rock thrown by Lorain hurtling toward Serene.\"Hmph.\"With a simple gesture from Serene, the feathers around her moved.Clink! Clink!The rock broke apart into fragments and fell as the feathers drew countless gashes into its front.Serene clasped her hands behind her back and dodged the remains, flying freely through the fragments.\"Come down here.\"Said Lorain while warming up her fists.\"I thought we were taking the assessment, you bastard.\"\"Our dear noble-blood seems quite foul-mouthed.\"Said Lorain while looking back at Simon.\"I think I have to get my hands on her. Simon, go run far away for now.\"He was already planning on it. As Simon turned his back and went further away, Serene gave a sad smile.\"Why are you sending him away like that? You have to let him see your \u2018awesomeness\u2019 from the side.\u201d\"That sarcastic way of speaking\u2026\"Jet-black began to pour from Lorain's body ferociously.\"It's annoying.\"\"Hmm.\"Serene folded her arms.\"Maybe you don't want to show your ugly side to someone you like......\"Lorain's red eyes burned from within. A long line was drawn in the air before opening up like a jagged beast's mouth.The space inside was one of darkness, and countless red eyes gleamed from within.The eyes looked identical to Lorain\u2019s, as if there were dozens of her eyes.\"I'm appalled.\"Said Serene.\"A power that unlocks the realm of the Devil. I wonder how topsy-turvy the world would get if they figured out what you people, the mother and daughter, are planning to\u2014\"Serene stopped talking and quickly flew up into the air. Countless red rays were fired from the mouth-shaped space.In an attempt to double, no, triple her rate of assent, Serene attached feathers to her body, each of them aiding her flight.\"Uwaaaa.\"Her body rotated, twisted, rose up to the air at high speed, and then went back down.Red rays of light were painted the sky in a destructive red.[Neigh!]Lorain took out a skeleton horse from her subspace. As she infused it with jet-black, black-red mana covered it, and it changed form.Tap!The skeleton horse immediately kicked off the ground as Lorain rode it into the sky. Soon, the two met in the air.\"I don't think it's a good idea for us to fight like this now.\"The feathers began to dance in the air as Serene stretched out her arms.\"We're destined to fight one day anyway, right? Since we'll be the rulers of Kizen and the Ivory Tower.\"\"If that happens, hundreds of millions of innocent lives will be wasted.\"Lorain roughly pulled the reins formed with jet-black.\"Therefore, it might be better to settle it up while we're still at the student level.\"\"Good grief. You and your mother are both disgusting hypocrites after all.\"Serene raised and crossed her arms.The pure-white feathers and crimson-red rays collided in the air.It was a natural disaster for the ordinary students taking the test on the central island.Everyone was frantically running from the remnants of the attack falling from the sky.Simon was no exception. When he looked up at the sky, he let out a feigned laugh.'......What in the world is that fight?'They were extraordinary monsters.They had already surpassed the level of the assessment and test.[Kuhehehe! There's no need to gawk at only that much!]Pier's clone opened its mouth and laughed.[The Ruler of Kizen? The Lord of the Ivory Tower? Hollow titles, the both of them! You're the Commander of the Legion! It won't take long for you to reach that sky!]\"Looks pretty distant for now.\"Replied Simon, grinning. In any case, after quickly escaping from the battlefield, Simon got lost in thought.\u2018Let's focus on my work again. With this much sound and vibration\u2026'Simon reached the cliff of the canyon.The location gave an unobstructed view of the island. Simon began to emit jet-black in all directions.'If Big Krum reacted to this and made his way nearby......'Crrrrruumble!A smile crept its way up Simon\u2019s lips.'I knew it!'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *Babababam!Simon twisted out of the way as the ground rose up and a monster's arm wrapped in bandages popped out.[Gwooooooooooooooooooh!]Then, the whole body of the monster was revealed.Every millimetre of skin was covered in bandages, but his eye sockets were clearly visible.'He's smaller than when I first saw him.'Simon heard that Big Krum got bigger the angrier he was. When fighting with Meilyn, he was big enough to put his face on the canyon with both legs on the ground, but now, he was barely hanging on the canyon.Thud!Big Krum was climbing up over the edge of the cliff, swinging a leg over the top.[Gwoooooooh!]He had to move first before he got attacked. Amassing all his might, Simon threw the object in his hand toward Big Krum's head.[Big Krum!!!]~Krum! ~Krum!The object that Simon threw was Pier's clone. Big Krum also paused and looked at the clone.[It's me, the Marshall of the Legion, Pier!][Pi......er?]He could communicate!Simon quickly turned his gaze upward. An observer was seen in the sky in the distance.'We should be fine for the next minute or two! The nearest observer isn\u2019t that close.'[I'm heading out!]As Simon opened the subspace, Pier immediately jumped out.While hiding himself amongst the trees, avoiding the oberserver\u2019s eye, Pier said,[What are you doing here, Big Krum?!! The Legion has revived! Hurry up and join the Legion!][Le......gion?]Big Krum tilted his huge head.[Le......gion?]Big Krum's head started to grow bigger.[Le......gion! Le......gion! Le......gion!]Soon, it was not just his head, but his whole body had begun inflating like a balloon.[Dammit!]As Big Krum grew bigger and bigger, Pier's clone fell from Big Krum. Simon quickly retrieved it and ran.[Legion! Hurts! Legion! Hurts! Legion! Hurts!]\"What's wrong with him, Pier?!\"[Now I'm certain! He's not Big Krum!]Said Pier in a serious voice.[That's an elaborately crafted fake! It's a clone of Big Krum!]As Big Krum began to grow endlessly, the observers flying in the sky came closer to see the situation.\"Pier! Please get back inside for now!\"[It hurrrrrrrrrrrrtsssssss!!]Big Krum, who grew bigger and bigger, lowered his head and looked at Simon.A shiver went down Simon\u2019s spine.[It's Legion! Legion hurts! I hate pain!]Woooooooooooosh!The giant hit the ground with a large fist. The entire edge of the cliff fell with a thunderous\u00a0bang!Simon rushed into the woods, blocking off Big Krum line of sight.\"But why is the clone attacking me?!\"[How the hell would I know that?!]Big Krum looked around in an attempt to find Simon.[Gwoooooooooooooooooooooh!]However, as Simon was nowhere to be seen, Big Krum began to smash at the ground blindly with his huge fists.\"Kyaaaaaaaah!\"\"Wh-What is that?\"Students could be heard screaming and shouting. Big Krum looked in the direction of the noise, lifted his huge leg up, and kicked.Bang!The entire area had collapsed, and you could see two students flying off.Fortunately, their teammates pulled them back with jet-black threads and got them out of there.[Gwooooooooooooooh!]Big Krum was getting bigger and bigger.[He went berserk!]Shouted Pier's clone.[If you leave him like this, he\u2019ll just keep getting bigger!]Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!Big Krum started in the opposite direction, away from the canyon.He was already out of control. And the whole island was still under the assessment.At this rate, someone could die.'Dammit!'Simon turned his back and ran. He had to take action right away.Waiting for the professors to stop the assessment would take to long. He felt it before, during the cyclops assessment, but Kizen didn't want to get involved in the students' matters unless they really had to.[Where are you going, Boy?! You're going in the opposite direction to him, you know?]\"I gotta persuade someone who can stop that!\"The place that Simon immediately ran to was the battlefield. The place where Lorain and Serene were fighting. The place no one would dare to step foot in.Distracted by their intense battle, the two of them hadn\u2019t noticed what was happening around them.\"Lorain!!\"Shouted Simon.\"There's a problem!!\"He didn\u2019t know if she could hear him while in the sky, but Lorain immediately stopped fighting and rode her skeleton horse down next to Simon.\"Simon! What's wrong?\"\"A super-large monster went berserk and is heading towards the students right now! We need to stop him!\"Lorain's expression stiffened up.\"Which way?\"\"Toward the southern island. I'll guide you.\"\"Ridiculous.\"Serene, arms crossed, came down from the sky.\"Who said I'd let her go?\"She held a feather in her hand.\"Whether it's berserk or whatever, that's the organizers' problem. I won't let our fight to come to nothi\u2014\"\"Ah, right. Serene, you were here too.\"Simon smiled as if he was glad to see her.\"I'm sorry, but could you help us?\"\"What?!\"\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Confusion at Simon\u2019s ridiculous request was clearly etched on Serene\u2019s face.\"Don't you think that sounded better in your head? Why should I help you?\"Simon answered while riding on the back seat of Lorain's skeleton horse,\"I\u2019ll consider myself to be in your debt.\"After leaving those words, Simon nodded to Lorain. The skeleton horse immediately soared into the sky as she pulled at the reins.'......Nonsense.'Serene raised a feather with a cold expression.The feather disassembled into a magic circle and transformed into a large ballista.\u201cYou're bad at playing politics, aren't you?\u201dAt that moment, she remembered what Simon had said.\u201cYour method only increases the number of your enemies.\u201d'......'Serene gnashed her teeth together.This was pure sophistry.She\u2019s always the strong one.The weak ones only had two choices: to be taken or to die.Since her mind-controlling abilities had reached their peak, the thoughts of others were never worth considering.But\u2026'My method is\u2026 bad?'Her gaze turned to the sky again, seeing Simon and Lorain having a friendly conversation on the skeleton horse.* * *\"You mean the monster went berserk, right?\"\"Yup.\"Simon nodded and continued,\"By the way, did you hear anything about me from Nefthis recently?\"\"Hm? What kind of \u2018anything\u2019?\"It was easy to read Lorain, who blinked in confusion during her response. Nefthis never told Lorain about the Legion.The secret was between Simon and Nefthis. Of course, someone else figured it out this time around, but that couldn't be helped.\"Nothing. Actually, a famous treasure hunter visited Class A as an outside lecturer, and the monster was listed in his materials. But it's not in the guidebook.\"Lorain pondered on the matter for a moment before saying,\"It could be an artificial monster that didn't originally inhabit this island.\"\"That's also possible.\"While Simon was briefing Lorain about what he\u2019d learnt so far, the distance to Big Krum shrank and shrank.The fake Big Krum, which had gone berserk, had grown to nearly 20 meters. It now crossed the river and entered the southern island.\"This is insane!\"\"What the hell is that?!\"The students quietly hunting monsters in the outskirts were busy running away because of the sudden appearance of a ginormous monster.As Big Krum passed by them and gave a kick, the ground overturned, and trees were uprooted. It really was a walking disaster.\"Kyaaaaaaah!\"Big Krum stopped and looked down at the screaming female student. He then raised his huge foot.\"Ah......!\"As the shadow of the foot came over her, the female student went stiff in horror.Whooooooosh!In that moment, a man bravely soared toward the foot of Big Krum before taking a deep breath and punching as hard as he could.Slam!The gargantuan body of Big Krum faltered for a moment, lost its balance, and took a step back.[Ohhhh!][Brett, nicely done!]Of course, his true identity wasn't Brett, but Elizabeth, who had transformed into Brett.She had a magic transmitter attached to her ear to communicate with the executive headquarters and other assistants.When she landed on the ground, the female student shouted as though touched,\"Thank you for saving me, assistant teacher!\"Elizabeth put her pointer finger on the forehead of the female student and pretended to flick it lightly.\"It's dangerous here, so get back.\"\"Yes!\"The female student, cheeks flushed, glanced back at Brett and soon ran off into the woods.'Ah, right, this isn't Brett's style.'Brett was just a simple musclehead. After reflecting on his character for a moment, Elizabeth put her hand on the magic transmitter and said,\"This is assistant Brett. I'll share what I learnt from the fight.\"Even Elizabeth felt as though it was a perfect imitation.\"The monster reacts sensitively to human sounds. Sounds made while running away seem fine, but screams and shouts are dangerous. Please tell that to the students.\"[This is HQ! Good work. We'll tell them immediately.][You already figured that out? Why are you so competent these days? This isn't like you.][I know, right? I thought even his brain was made up of muscle.]Judging from the reactions of the other assistant teachers, it seemed that he wasn't a competent person at work.Elizabeth cleared her throat and bluntly said,\"Every assistant who's under me, shut your mouths.\"[Bwahaha! As expected from big bro!]\"And HQ, there's one more thing I need to share. Combat should be avoided at all costs, and student rescue should be the first prio\u2014\"While Elizabeth was talking, another assistant started flying toward Big Krum.[Hey, Brett!]It was Chris, an assistant teacher for Mechanics of Jet-Black.[I get what you're thinking, but none of the students will be able to hunt this thing. I'll just do it myself!!]He soared up into the air and made a rough swing with his scythe. A half-moon slash shot out and cut into Big Krum's back.[Okay! I injur\u2014!!]Big Krum looked back, unscathed, and threw a punch like a thunderbolt.Whaaaaaaaaam!Such tremendous speed! Chris flew hundreds of meters within seconds of being hit and ended up stuck in the ground.[Kugh! Cough Cough!\u00a0Ah, damn! This bastard hurts so muuuuuuch!]You could feel a lot of pain from the shout heard through the transmitter.\"That's why I told you that, Chris. HQ, I'll repeat it again.\"Elizabeth raised her head and continued speaking.\"He has the ability to regenerate. Combat should be avoided at all costs, and student rescue should be the first priority.\"[Copy that.]Elizabeth was once Big Krum\u2019s comrade, so she already knew this much. After turning off the transmitter, her expression became complicated.'Looks like Commander screwed it up in the end.'If Big Krum went completely berserk, nobody could stop him.It seemed like persuasion failed, and in this case, there'd be no choice but to get rid of him while causing as little damage as possible. Kizen headquarters might stage an investigation if someone ended up dying, complicating things.'For now, I need to meet Commander.'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *\"Hold on tight, Simon!\"Lorain stretched her arms out behind her while riding the skeleton horse. An empty void tore itself into space to form what looked like the mouth of a beast and revealed the silhouettes of eyes the same shade of red as hers.Whaaaaaaaaap!Rays of red light shot out from within and pierced through Big Krum's body one after the other.Big Krum, with a hole in his body, raised his right arm.\"Kugh!\"She pulled at the reins, and the skeleton horse dived down, leaving Big Krum's arm to pass through nothing but air.Whiiiiiish!It was by a hair's breadth. Simon wiped back his bangs billowing in the wind and secured his view.\"Lorain! From the side!\"\"......!\"Before they knew it, Big Krum's leg was approaching.A kick with that heavy body!She hastily pulled the reins, but the reactions of the skeleton horse were too slow.\"Simon! Brace for the fall!\"As Simon covered his head with both arms, a feather suddenly flew in front of them and spread out in the form of a defensive magic circle.Slam!While Big Krum's legs collided with the magic circle and slowed, the skeleton horse flew out of the way of the attack.'Don't tell me, this ability is\u2026!'Simon turned his head. Countless feathers were piercing into and all the way through Big Krum's body.Woooosh!Blood poured out from all over Big Krum's now-mutilated body, and the feathers returned once more to the platinum-haired girl floating in the air.\"Serene!\"\"Hmm.\"She put a hand to her chin, looking concerned.\"As expected. Physical attacks won't do.\"Big Krum's body quickly recovered from the wounds it had received from Lorain and Serene. It barely looked like he\u2019d taken any damage.\"Then what about this one?\"The feathers wrapped around her hands flew out in a flash and lodged themselves into Big Krum's body.The emotion imbued into these feathers was 'calmness'. And there were a whopping twenty of them.It wouldn't be strange for someone hit by that many to fall into a vegetative state.However\u2026[Gwoooooooooooooooh!]Big Krum got even more furious and punched at Serene. Her brow furrowed and she soared higher into the air.\"This is why I don't like ignorant undead.\"Even Lorain and Serene, unrivaled in skill amongst the first-year students of Kizen, had no way of dealing with him.Once the two had stopped attacking for a while, Big Krum looked around again, searching for students on the ground.\"At this rate, this\u2019ll never end.\"In order to buy time for the students to evacuate, they had to draw Big Krum\u2019s attention by attacking.Lorain poured out attack after attack, forcing Big Krum's attention away. Irritated, Big Krum swung his arm.Whooooosh!The skeleton horse had to fly down until it was just above the treetops to dodge the attack.When Lorain was about to pull at the reins to fly back up\u2026[Announcement from headquarters.]They heard a voice from the tongue pad.'Don't tell me they're stopping the assessment just like this.'Simon waited for the next words, nerves clear on his face.[An unidentified monster's attack is taking place on the southern island of the Kera archipelago. Students on the southern island will be forced to teleport to a random location on another island. After teleporting, you'll be immune to damage for 5 minutes.]Simon sighed in relief. He thought that it was the right decision.[Students who wish to reject the teleportation, please input the rejection sign on the tongue pad. If you choose to do this, headquarters is not responsible for any problems that arise.]Lorain and Simon immediately inputted the rejection sign.\"Simon!\"Lorain looked surprised.\"You should go back to the center and continue with your assessment! This is Kizen's probl\u2014\"\"No. I'll stay.\"'Since it's partly my fault, too.'Simon looked at Big Krum with a hardened expression. Blue lights seemed to indicate that teleportation was in progress in various parts of the southern island.\"Simoooooon!\"At that moment, Simon lowered his head at the voice calling him. Elizabeth, who had transformed into Brett, was waving from the top of a tree.\"Lorain! I'll go down for a moment.\"\"What? Wait a second! Just how much are you going to do things your\u2014!\"Simon had already jumped off the skeleton horse.\"I'll signal you again!\"\"Simon!\"As Simon came down from the sky, Elizabeth immediately jumped off the tree. She caught him like a groom carrying their bride and easily landed on the ground.\"Ta-dah!\"\"......\"Simon, who suddenly ended up getting embraced by the muscular man, let out a sigh.\"I can come down by myself without you doing all this.\"\"Fufu. There's no need to be embarrassed, Commander.\"As she was setting Simon down, a turquoise marble started falling from the sky.Simon reached out his arm and grabbed it.[Simon! Can you hear me?]It was Lorain's voice. As Simon raised his head, he saw Lorain on the skeleton horse holding the same item.[It's a magic communication device. Just press the button below and speak. There's not much mana left, so make sure to conserve it.]\"Ah, okay.\"Lorain immediately led the skeleton horse toward Big Krum.\"By the way, Commander, what's going on?\"\"Ah, you see\u2026\"Simon turned off the communication device and informed Elizabeth of the current situation in detail.She nodded her head.\"So it's a fake Big Krum. I see.\"\"Yeap. We need to get rid of it before the situation gets worse.\"\"But how do we deal with a monster with regeneration and the powers of a giant\u2026?\"[Kuhehehehe!]Both of them looked down.A sinister grin had made its way across the mouth of Pier's clone dangling on Simon's school uniform.[I have an idea!]\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90The biggest problem with the fake Big Krum was its regeneration.But according to Pier, his greatsword possessed the power of destruction, which could solve this problem.Simply put, living creatures that come in direct contact with the sword will receive wounds that cannot be regenerated nor healed.\"I mean, why are you saying that now!\"Said Simon, losing his cool. Pier clicked his tongue.[It's because I can't get out! Look! There are so many eyes around.]That was true. Since it was an emergency situation, over a dozen Observers were roaming around Big Krum.\"Could I maybe borrow your sword and use it, Pier?\"[This is a spirit sword made of my body! No one but me can lift it, let alone wield it.]Simon pondered for a moment, then snapped his fingers and smiled.\"Then how about this?\"[Say it.]After hearing Simon's plan, Pier burst out laughing.[What a crazy idea!]\"Well, no harm in trying, right? Let's give it a shot.\"[Sure!]Simon opened up his subspace, and Pier dropped the greatsword to the ground. Just in case, Simon tried to grab the handle and carry the sword, but it wouldn't even budge.\"Well then, I'll begin.\"Simon once again opened the subspace. But this time, it wasn\u2019t on the ground.Whirrrrr!Instead, he opened the subspace using Pier's greatsword as the floor.After a while, Pier, still in the subspace, reached out with his skeletal arm and grabbed the sword's handle.\"There we go! Just keep holding it and raise it up there!\"Creak.Pier's arm from the subspace turned the greatsword upright. Simon and Elizabeth exclaimed in unison,\"It worked!\"\"You really are ingenious, Commander!\"[Ingenious, my ass!]Pier's clone shouted as though dumbfounded,[You want me to swing my sword in this state? I can't do anything more than hold it!]\"Just holding it will be enough.\"Simon approached and placed his hand on the handle of the sword still gripped by Pier. Pier focussed his vision with his clone and strained his hand.\"Turn it upright!\"At Simon's words, Pier moved the greatsword, and it moved just as if Simon was the one wielding it.Of course, Simon was only pretending to hold it. Pier was the one who supported the weight and strength of the sword.\"You're good at this!\"[......This feels strange. I've never held my sword like this in all my life nor afterlife.]\"We can't help it. This is better than being caught by Kizen and getting chased after.\"Elizabeth pulled a string out from her fingertips and wove it into Simon\u2019s clothes before tying it to where the sword and Pier's arm were visible, hiding it.Now this made it perfect.\"......By the way.\"Simon felt a bit dizzy. Jet-black was constantly being sucked into the ring on his finger.\"It takes quite a lot of jet-black to keep the subspace open.\"\"This will strain the subspace too. Let's keep it closed until you reach in front of the Big Krum.\"Simon closed the subspace again, retrieved Pier's greatsword, and ran.Originally, it seemed like he would have to run for a long time, but in a disguised blessing of fate, Big Krum turned his back and returned to the central Kera Island after rampaging through the southern island.'I definitely need to stop him from getting there, no matter what.'Today was the third day of Island survival.The majority of students would be gathered on Kera Island.If Big Krum attacked Kera Island, the assessment would definitely be halted, and in the worst case, a catastrophe could occur.While running, Simon activated the magic communication device.\"Lorain! Can you hear me?\"A buzzing noise was heard, then, after a moment, Lorain's voice came out of the device.[Loud and clear! Other than that, the situation isn't so great right now. The monster is heading back to the central island.]\"I'm looking at it too. I have a way to defeat that monster now, you know?\"[What's that?]\"I have a weapon that suppresses his regeneration. I have to be the one to wield it. Can you seal off the monster's arm for just 5 minutes? Please tell Serene, too!\"Having said that, Simon also wondered if he was giving the notice too unilaterally, not giving much explanation.But\u2026[Alright.]Responded Lorain unhesitantly, before cutting off the communication. She then turned her gaze and looked at Serene flying nearby.\"You heard that?\"\"Hah.\"Serene let out a feigned laugh.\"Who is he to use us like this?\"\"He said he has a way to suppress the regeneration. Got any better ideas?\"\"I mean, do you really believe that?\"\"Yeah.\"Lorain nodded her head as though it were obvious.\"I definitely trust him.\"\"......\"\"You take the left hand.\"After leaving those words, Lorain pulled at her skeleton horse\u2019s reins and left.\u2018......Sigh.\u2019From Serene's point of view, the world was full of things she found difficult to understand.As she lowered her gaze, she saw Simon was indeed charging toward Big Krum.\u201cYour method only increases the number of your enemies.\u201d\"Agh, for reeeaaal!\"Muttered Serene in anger as she crossed her arms. Countless feathers fluttered around her body in the air.Meanwhile, Simon was soon reaching the base of one of Big Krum's feet.As he approached it, he saw it wasn\u2019t just kicking up the dust around it, but the ground, too, creating a yellow-ish haze.\u201cEliza! You ready?\"\"Anytime!\"\"Here I go!\"The moment Big Krum's foot touched the ground, Simon stepped on a jet-black platform and jumped up with all his might, landing on the top of the foot.Pshk!Then, he plunged the sword down into it.The giant's eyes turned downward as if he felt the pain. Its gaze alone was enough to make Simon start sweating profusely.'Here I go.'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *There was no time to hesitate. Simon started running, bringing forth all the jet-black in his body and dragging with him the greatsword still dug into Big Krum\u2019s flesh.From the top of the foot to the ankle, and from the ankle to the leg.\"Haaaaaaaaah!\"He ran straight up with the greatsword buried in flesh.What Pier said about the power of destruction looked to be true. The wounds made by the greatsword weren\u2019t regenerating.Slide!Slide!Big Krum didn't just stay still, either. Every strip of the biological bandages surrounding his body tore off and started flying at Simon.Simon concentrated on his vision.'......Focus!'He reproduced the image that Bahil taught him. Time slowed down, and both his running speed and the speed of the bandages flying toward him slowed to a crawl.Simon avoided the bandages with the smallest movements possible, keeping the same form to keep dragging the greatsword through Big Krum\u2019s flesh.\"You need to keep running while making a deeper wound with the greatsword!\"Shouted Elizabeth, who was still transformed into Brett. She was running side by side with Simon.\"You have to keep him in pain to weaken his attacks!\"\"Got it!\"He could definitely feel the number of attacks lessening as he shoved the blade in deeper and kept running.But this time, a lump of flesh came up from Big Krum\u2019s abdomen, and a third arm burst forth!'He has an arm on his abdomen?!'It opened its hand and came down to grab Simon.\"Leave it to me!\"Elizabeth overtook Simon and collided head-on with the arm. Having grabbed it, she shouted,\"You go on ahead!\"\"Thank you!\"Passing over Elizabeth, Simon had now reached the giant's navel.But all of a sudden, his surroundings went dark. Big Krum's large right hand was coming down to grab Simon.Elizabeth shouted, \u201cDodge it!\u201d while watching from behind, but Simon bit his lip and kept running straight.Slaaaash!Just then, Big Krum's entire wrist fell off, revealing Lorain standing behind it.\"Keep running, Simon!\"On her head grew two straight horns, reminiscent of a devil\u2019s.Slice! Slice! Slice! Slice!Each time the black dagger in her hand danced, the monster's arm split like butchered meat.In an instant, she had climbed up to the monster's shoulder, ripped its entire right arm from its body, leaped into the air, and rode off on the skeleton horse waiting in the air.'As expected from Lorain!'Big Krum, having lost his right arm, stretched out his left arm this time.Flutter!Black feathers wrapped around the arm. Serene released her crossed arms and swung them gracefully.[Chain of Ten Thousand Wings]Clang! Clang!Feathers disassembled themselves into magic circles before turning into chains, which linked together.The links fitted together perfectly, and a chain, formed into a pretzel-like shape, sealed the left arm and fixed it in the sky as it was.[Gwooooooooooooooh!]Big Krum roared in fury and shook his left arm, but the chains just clanged against each other, refusing to break.He eventually moved his right arm, which was cut off by Lorain. The pieces of meat torn into seven pieces stuck together like a sticky jelly and slowly began to return to their original shape.Lorain, riding on her skeleton horse, swooped in and swung her black dagger once more.Creeeaaak!This time, she diced the arm up into many cubes, all sent flying in different directions.However, they weren\u2019t able to completely scatter, a viscous liquid quickly rejoining them.The only person who had made any lasting damage was Simon, who had climbed further up while slicing through Big Krum with Pier's greatsword.\"Huff! Haah! Phew!\"He had reached Big Krum's chest, but Simon was already feeling the limits of his stamina. No, he wasn\u2019t just feeling them. He had already passed his limits several times over.Even though Pier was the one carrying the greatsword, he had to run up a nearly 90-degree incline while maintaining his jet-black stepping and subspace, all while dodging flying bandages.The conditions were, needless to say, atrocious.Nevertheless\u2026'I'll pull it off no matter what!'If he fell now, he wouldn\u2019t survive the landing.With a distant view of the ground below, Simon forced his stiff legs to run.'Ah!'At that moment, the strength in his right foot, landing on the chest, lost its strength, and Simon started to stumble.Then, his body wobbled\u2026 and fell.[Oh my, are you already tired?]A feather fluttered in front of Simon's face.'Serene?'Ta tap!Tap!Feathers began to attach to Simon's back.[I'll give you a push.]The feathers immediately dissipated and formed into one magic circle, which soon emitted a tremendous force resembling a rocket.With the aid of this force, Simon managed to muster the strength to step back on the giant's chest with his right leg.'Huuf!'He started running once more.Feathers now supporting his back, it became several times easier. It felt more like flying than it did running.\"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"With a wild shout as he leaped up to the giant\u2019s shoulder\u2026Finally, he could see the clear sky.There was nothing more on top. From the side, he could see the giant's shoulders and neck.Simon then landed on the shoulder and ran toward the neck.'Pier!!'[I'm ready, Boy!]Simon was rushing in, Observers focussed only on him.And beyond that was Serene, wearing a complicated expression.'......Simon Polentia.'Truth be told, she was planning on replacing the Commander with someone else.What she needed wasn't a boy named Simon, but the undead that the boy possessed, and the power known as \u2018Commander\u2019.There were plenty of necromancers in the Ivory Tower who'd become infinitely stronger if they got the Legion, and Simon was destined to disappear, no matter what.However\u2026The image of a boy running toward the neck of the monster\u2014his legs reaching their limits, face frowning in the force of the buffeting winds, and voice yelling at the top of its lungs\u2014was all Serene could see.An unbreaking will'Could the......'Could the necromancers of the Ivory Tower pull that off?Could they even imitate it?Simon, who had overcome all obstacles, reached the giant's neck, and swung the pure white sword with an explosive shout.Slaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash!He split the world in two.The giant\u2019s neck, several dozen times bigger than Simon, was cut neatly in half, severing the head from the rest of the body.Serene felt like she was being swept away by a flood of thrills.She\u2026\u2026had no choice but to admit it.'Irreplaceable.'No one in the Ivory Tower could replace Simon Polentia.[Bwahahahahaha! You did it! Boy! You did it!]Simon also smiled at Pier's shout. Then, as the giant's head flew away, Simon started to lose his balance.All the way up in the sky, where the cold winds blew, Simon felt exhilaration wash over him.And\u2026\"Simon!\"He lost consciousness.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Simon, having lost consciousness, began to fall.\"Simon!\"The moment Lorain pulled the reins and went to rescue Simon, the biological bandages holding Big Krum started flying out in all directions.\"Kugh\u2026!\"The bandages smashed the rock walls, slashed through entire trees, and devastated the surroundings. Some even flew to the central Kera Island.Lorain hurriedly spread a protective magic circle around and swung her black dagger to cut the bandages, and Serene sent feathers to seal them.The assistant teachers also quickly moved out for clean-up.\"Ah, Simon!!\"\"Don't worry.\"Serene stretched out her right arm in the direction Simon fell. A faint light flashed on the feathers that remained on Simon's back.\"I set the remaining feathers to slow him with their remaining power, so even if he falls, he won't be hurt.\"\"Thanks.\"Serene widened her eyes and gasped, looking utterly aghast.\"I might be the one who helped Simon, but why are you saying thanks? It\u2019s irritating.\"\"......?\"Lorain blinked in confusion.* * *The place Simon fell was the shores of the southern island. And there was someone else who found Simon, who had lost consciousness faster than anyone else.'Bwahaha! To think this kind of fortune comes after a crisis!'Haren Cork was running in the direction Simon had fallen.He actually almost died a while ago.Perhaps the effect of the feather Serene had given him had expired. Malcolm had come to his senses. He was lucky to notice it immediately and run. Otherwise, everything would've ended with Malcolm's revenge.Still, Haren had something to back him up.'If I finish this mission, I'll also be able to join Serene's faction!'What could the No.10, who got on the last bus, do to him if he's under the No.2, the successor of Ivory Tower?Above all, if things went well and he became the direct disciple of Bahil, no one would be able to lay a finger on him.There were almost no students on the southern island due to the uproar just now, so he could cross the bridge without any disturbance.Arriving on the southern island, Haren made his way through the bushes and moved forward, and finally\u2026\"Found you!\"Haren had found Simon. He was lying on the grass, completely unconscious.\"What a welcome stroke of\u2014! Huh?\"Haren stepped back. Someone had come here first.A man of tall height and broad shoulders.'H-Hector!'It must\u2019ve been Hector Moore from Class A.Swoosh.As Hector turned his head to look back, Haren gulped.Thinking about it, he'd heard rumors that this guy was also targeting Simon. If that was true, then there was room for discussion.\"Ahaha! Hi! Do you also have a business with Simon?\"\"......\"Hector didn't answer and just looked down at Haren with an expressionless face.\"I have an offer.\"Haren smirked.\"Let me finish that guy. You can take Simon's tongue-pad points if you let me do so.\"\"......\"\"Or what, do you want the honor of getting rid of the Special Admission No.1? Sure, sure. You can spread rumors about it. I just have to finish h\u2014\"Hector walked over to Haren. Haren sensed something was off and started taking steps back.\"N-No! What's wrong?! I'm saying I'll yield everything to you!Hector's body moved swiftly, forcing Haren to hurriedly raise his Black Hand in order to protect himself.Thud!\u201cCough, cough!\u201dHaren stepped back in shock before falling to a knee. A mark was left in the center of the Black Hand, as if the center had been partially dug out.\"......Fucking trash bastard.\"A subspace opened next to Hector, and gooey, foul-smelling scales began to stick to his right arm.From Haren's point of view, it was just confusing.\u2018Why is he doing this? Didn't they say Hector hates Simon?\u2019\"I mean\u2026 Hey! Wait for a second! Do you even have any idea who ordered me to do\u2014!\"Hector smiled.\"I don't need to know.\"His fist, covered in black scales, lept forward, creating shockwaves as it traveled.Haren's will to fight had already been broken by the previous attack, so realizing that he was no match, he immediately turned tail and ran.\"Tsk.\"Hector didn't even bother to chase after Haren, who had run into the forest. Instead, his gaze turned to Simon, still laying on the grass.'Do you think I'm going to fucking settle it like this?'Hector gnashed his teeth.\"Simon!\"It was then. Lorain, riding her skeleton horse, appeared from the sky.She jumped off her horse, dashed forward, and knelt in front of Simon to check his condition. He had lost consciousness due to exhaustion, but luckily, he didn't seem to be injured.\"......!\u201dThen, she saw Hector standing not too far away. She pulled Simon close and kept a wary eye on him.'This is going to be hard.'She had no chance to take a break after the battle with Serene, having to face Big Krum straight after.There was nothing left but fumes for both her stamina, and jet-black reserves. Even if it was Lorain, she couldn't guarantee victory if the opponent was Hector.Her gaze turned to Hector's transformed right arm.\"......\"However\u2026Hector, who looked at the two without saying a word, turned his back and walked away.'He's just going to leave?'As Lorain blinked in confusion, Simon groaned and began to move.\"Simon! Simon! Are you okay? Simon!\"Having started trying to shake Simon awake, Lorain took out a potion from her subspace and stuck it in his mouth.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *\"Huff! Huff! Fuck! Fuck!\"Haren was frantically running away from Hector.'I can't give up like this! Never!'Simon had just been knocked out. In a state where a single move would do it. But he couldn\u2019t do it because of one person who was in the way?Unacceptable.If he couldn't fight Hector on his own, he had to somehow recruit another teammate.He pulled out a feather from his arms. He only had two feathers left on him, and one of them had to be saved for Simon.'Is there anyone?'As Haren was frantically looking around the bushes, something struck his foot.'......Ah shit, that startled me!'It was the corpse of a monster.He was wondering why the monsters weren't appearing. The corpses of monsters were piled up like mountains in this place.Even level 3 monsters, the ones at the top of the island\u2019s food chain, had been defeated. They had been pound into just piles of flesh after a one-sided beating, making it hard to even properly recognize them.And in the middle of those corpses, a male student in a Kizen uniform was sitting on a rock, seemingly taking a break.'......A-A chance!'Haren couldn't figure out why that man refused to teleport and stayed on the southern island, but he seemed pretty strong.Haren took a deep breath, kept his distance, and then threw Serene's feather. It attached right on the guy\u2019s back.Haren cheered internally and revealed himself.\"Hey, get ready!\"Hearing Haren's shout, the male student slowly turned around.He could see faded gray hair and a scar on the right side of his face that looked like it was cutting his blood-shot eye in half. He was a man who exuded danger.'He sure looks bloody. Was there a guy like him among the first years?'The man scratched at the scar across his eye.\"What's your business?\"\"Who are you? Name yourself.\"\"Kajann Edvalt.\"Kajann Edvalt? He\u2019d never heard such a name.\"Alright, Kajann. We're going to go hunt Simon Polentia, starting now.\"\"......\"\"He's currently unconscious, but Hector Moore is interfering at his side. If you get Hector's attention, I'll sneak in from the back and finish Simon. Any questions?\"Kajann slowly stood up.\"Are you targeting Simon Polentia?\"\"Uh, yeah! And I won't be accepting questions from now on! You'll have to listen to me no matter wh\u2014\"Kajann began to stride toward Haren. A cold sweat came over Haren without him even realizing.What?Why am I getting a sense of deja vu?\"W-Wait! Stop! Stop right there!\"But Kajann didn't obey his orders. Haren felt the hairs on the back of his neck start to prickle.'Ugh, shit! Why isn\u2019t it working? That woman! She should've told me if there were duds mixed in\u2026!\"\"Are you acting up because of this?\"Kajann put his hand behind his back and plucked out the feather. Then, he threw it at the level 2 monster hiding in the nearby bush, a wrecker.Pshk!The feather nailed itself right into the body of the wrecker. Then, it lay flat on its back and showed its stomach to Kajann.'What? I-It's effective\u2026!'Haren\u2019s jaw dropped out of shock. There was someone who Serene's mind-controlling abilities didn\u2019t work on?\"W-Wait and listen to me for a second!\"Shouted Haren while waving his hands.\"Yeah, sorry! That was my bad just now! Let's make a deal! Judging from the effort you put in hunting, I think you need points, too. Just help me hunt Simon! Then I'll give you half of my points as well as Simon's\u2014!\"\"The very premise is already wrong.\"Kajann clenched his fist. The jet-black of a dreary light began to wave in his hand.\"I can't just let you be if you're after Simon.\"\"......!!\"Haren flinched and stepped back. Then, finally losing his last straw, he shouted,\"Dammit! Even you?!\"\"Hm?\"\"What the hell is Simon, and why is he making everyone go that far? Even Professor Bahil, Serene, and Hector! What in the world is with that bastard for everyone to be making such a fuss?!\"Kajann flatly replied,\"He's just my roommate.\"\"R-Roommate?\"\"It's been a while since someone I like came in. He doesn't mind about my business at all, and he's quiet till I get to sleep. However\u2026\"A thick bloodlust flew out from Kajann's body.\"Once Simon leaves Kizen, another noisy bastard might enter my room.\"\"What kind of bullshit are you blabbering abooouuut!\"Haren rushed towards him with a harsh shout and thrust his Black Hand.But\u2026Tap.It was blocked by the index finger that Kajann lightly raised.\"......Huh?\"Kajann grabbed the Black Hand and yanked it with overwhelming strength. Haren found his body helplessly pulled toward Kajaan, and his eyes were filled with nothing but fear.\"Don't lay your hand on that guy, you trash.\"Thuuuuuuuuuump!A headbutt. Kajann's head hit Haren's forehead like it was hammering in a nail, and Haren's face found itself stuck in the ground, unable to even change expression.The barrier was completely shattered with that blow, and even the emergency shield was damaged, making sparks fly as it crackled.Looking at Haren, who was being forcibly teleported after fainting, Kajann turned his back without a second thought.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Island Survival.The last day, the 4th day.The assessment ends at noon. Only an hour remained.Camibarez, who succeeded in entering the indestructible mansion, was staring at only the entrance, anxious.\"Are you that worried?\"Camibarez turned around.Looking as though she had just washed her hair, Meilyn, wearing a towel over her head, put down a glass of fruit juice and winked.\"Ah, thank you.\"\"Don't worry about them too much.\"She also sat down next to Camibarez and sipped her juice.\"They aren't guys who'll get knocked out of the test so easily. They'll definitely arrive on time.\"\"Right?\"200 points upon entering the indestructible mansion.It was a place you had no choice but to enter if you were aiming for anything but the lower ranks.The mansion's inside was a non-combat zone, and you could freely use all the facilities here. If you chewed on monster meat or plant roots in the jungle, you could enjoy all kinds of luxurious foods, desserts, shower facilities, and other entertainments in the mansion.Of course, not everyone was just resting in the mansion. Some students waited around the mansion and sniped others as they tried to enter.The later the students entered the mansion, the more likely that they had amassed a lot of points by hunting monsters. When these students entered the mansion, they became a threatening competitor, but at the same time, if you could hunt them, it was possible to double, or even triple your points.So the students who entered the mansion first formed an 'alliance' among themselves and built a defensive line. In fact, the latecomers couldn't even dare to enter with how tight the mansion's security was.\"Now, now. Could you please focus a little bit more?\"The person who led this mansion group's large-scale 'alliance', Class E's Special Admission No.7 Elissa, entered the mansion. She always wore a large admiral's coat over her school uniform.\"There's now only one hour left for the survival assessment. I want you all to go out and help in defending the mansion. If the students who have earned points till now enter the mansion, we would be able to do nothing but fall in the rankings.\"Elissa was the daughter of the Prime Minister of Dresden.Matching her father's personality, she was also a thorough politician. Famous in this assessment for occupying the West Island\u2019s bridge, she had extorted many student\u2019s points.\"It's for all our grades. I'd like you to cooperate.\"There was power and appeal in her voice and a justification for her claim. Many students joined the Mansion Alliance because her appeal stimulated a sense of belonging and crisis.Elissa turned her head and looked at Meilyn.\"I think it'd be a big help if you came to the defending team too, Ms. Top of Class A.\"Meilyn scoffed.\"I'm not interested.\"\"That's unexpected. I thought you and I were similar. Don't you like this kind of method? Last time, even after I begged you to show me the Vice-President\u2019s practice test paper, you ignored me all the way to the end, saying things about the profit of the class and such.\"Meilyn chuckled and shot back,\"You were still holding that against me? You're more narrow-minded than you look.\"Elissa's eye twitched slightly, but there was no further change to her poker face. Then, she spat out,\"I get it. Things falling into your lap. A selfish mindset where you only take care of your own profit.\"At those words, the air of the students around Elissa became heavy. Some students even pressured Meilyn with deathly glares.Camibarez panicked and looked at Elissa and Meilyn in turn, but Meilyn responded with a smile.\"Your problem is that you're too egocentric. People aren't your chess pieces, you know? Don't expect that everyone will listen to you.\"\"......\"\"I'll remember this.\"The other students followed her, leaving the mansion like escorts.\"A-Are you alright, Meilyn? There's no need to provoke such a big-shot student like that......!\"\"It's fine. She's the type of person who only understands something if you tell her plainly.\"Meilyn calmly rested her chin on her hand and looked at the door. Camibarez also looked toward the entrance.\"Ah!\"Then, Camibarez suddenly shot up.\"What's wrong, Cami?\"\"Simon! Simon is coming!\"\"Really? Wh-Where? Where is he?\"While the two of them were making a fuss, the movement outside the mansion also became busier.Calls such as, \u201cGet ready!\u201d and, \u201cIn position!\u201d could be heard. Elissa was even carrying a magic megaphone and leading the students.\"Ah\u2026!\"Meilyn could finally see it. Simon was walking towards the mansion from a hill in the distance.However, the people he was with were odd. Walking beside Simon, approaching the mansion with leisurely gaits, she could see Lorain on his right, and someone who she didn't even want to imagine on his left.'Why is Serene with Simon?!'Meilyn lept from her seat.There was no mistake. Simon must've been affected by her powers.Frightened, Meilyn started putting on her school blazer.\"Get ready, Cami! Looks like Simon became Serene's plaything\u2026\"\"Oh, I don't think that's the case.\"Said Camibarez as she pointed at the three.When Simon opened his mouth, Lorain laughed, and Serene was seen flying off the handle and complaining.Certainly, they looked too normal to say that he was being mind controlled.'But why is he acting friendly with Serene?!'That moment when Meilyn was boiling up\u2026[Hold on! I have a suggestion to make for you guys.]Elissa's voice, amplified by the magic megaphone, was heard. Of course, 'you guys' was referring to Simon and his group.[We have no intention to fight. In exchange for letting you guys in......]Elissa, who was on top of a tree, looked over them.At the sight of the strong, all the students who had only been watching from around the mansion were flocking in. There were no less than 50 of them.'Dammit.''We're caught.'The onlookers all looked startled by the situation. However, Lorain didn't react, it seemingly not mattering to her, and Serene just stared straight ahead.\"I'm dumbfounded.\"Shhk.Elissa, holding the magic megaphone, lowered her head in surprise.With a loud\u00a0thud, a feather lodged itself in the tree above her head.\"Who do you think you're bossing around?\"Serene gave a cold smile.Elissa frowned. As expected, things wouldn\u2019t be that easy.\"Alright.\"Supported by her teammates, she stood up and snapped her fingers, wearing a sour face.Whir! Whir! Whir! Whir! Whir!Five subspaces opened in the air, and from each, a large sailing ship floated out.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *The ships looked like they had just been pulled up after being wrecked by a typhoon. Their hulls were old and rusty, and the sails were punctured or torn.\"Woooaaah!\"\"It's Elissa's phantom ships!\"Elissa was a rather special Necromancy aspirant. She was able to control 'Phantom Ships', powered by both spirit and jet-black.The cannons lowered in their gunports in unison, aiming at Simon's party and the students behind them.[I hereby declare\u2026]Said Elissa, now also wearing a cold smile.[Wipe out anyone who tries to enter the mansion. Dropped tongue pad points will be distributed equally among all participating defenders. I, Elissa, will guarantee it.]Heated cheers erupted from all over the mansion.\"To float a sailing boat in the sky like that\u2026\"\"She really is in a different league!\"While the students who were about to enter the mansion were shaken, Serene gave a bored yet graceful yawn with her hands just falling by her side instead of casting spells, and Lorain dropped her glance in disinterest.Simon also looked at them while stretching his shoulder, then said,\"Let's breakthrough.\"The two nodded their heads.Using Simon rushing in as a signal, the girls also followed. Lorain took out her skeleton horse while running and hopped on, and for Serene, both her feet separated from the ground.\"The special admissions are going in!\"\"Let\u2019s catch up with them!\"The rest of the students clenched their teeth and ran, too. The phantom ships in the sky were threatening, but the students were almost out of time.\"Looks like a moth leaping into a flame.\"Elissa stretched out her arm.\"Wipe them out.\"With the deafening explosions, the cannons fired all at once.Dozens of jet-black shells fell and devastated the ground. The forest in front of the mansion was instantly engulfed in smoke and flame.'This is no joke.'The smoke from the shelling made Simon unable to tell his surroundings apart. He also got separated from Lorain and Serene, who had come with him.Simon, who was moving frantically to dodge the falling shells, beckoned behind him as if given no other options.Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!A mud golem that was assembled in advance popped out of the thick smoke. The golem rushed through the gunfire with Simon on board.\"I-It's a golem!\"\"If it's Summoning, then it must be Simon Polentia! Stop him!\"Shouted some of the students of the defense team, who had even erected a fence around the mansion. The golem charged head-on as various projectiles poured down frantically.Babababababang!After withstanding the full force of everything launched at it, the golem rushed in like a chariot and smashed the fence, sending the students who were holding out near it flying.\"Kugh!\"The defensive line was broken through in a single attack. The defending students quickly fell back. Simon, who was latched onto the back of the golem, smiled while waving his hand without concern.\"Stop that bastar\u2014! Huhh?\"Skeleton bones had been scattered all over the floor before they knew it, and then, Simon clenched his fist.[Bone Nail Application: Clutter]Broken bones soared into the sky and rotated like whirlwinds. They smacked into the students\u2019 faces, tripped them, and impeded their movements. The students ended up rolling helplessly on the floor or banging their heads on the fence.[Boy! Watch your front!]\"What? The golem should take care of the fro\u2014\"Pooooooooow!At the sudden impact, Simon bounced off from the golem's back and rolled across the dirt ground.Tasting soil, he spat and stared straight ahead.\"Hector\u2026!\"Simon was surprised. Hector, whose upper body was covered with black scales, was in a battle of strength against the golem.\"Simon!!\"Holding down the golem with strength alone, Hector boomed,\"Let's settle our fight this time!\"'Why the hell is he disturbing me here when I'm running out of time?'Simon frowned and drew his arm in a downward arc. Power was added to the mud golem, and it pressed down on Hector with all its might. Hector's legs trembled, and the ground started sinking beneath him.\"Kuuuuuuuugh!\"Hector's face flushed red, and veins popped out of his head. Soon, he opened his mouth wide and spewed out something black from his throat.\u2018Breath\u2019 was a technique known as being symbolic of dragons.The mud golem staggered back after being hit in the chest by the black wave pouring out of Hector's mouth.\"Phew! Huff!\"Hector gasped for breath and fixed his stance. His entire upper body was covered with scales.The unique power of the Moore family to transform into a death dragon. This was what granted them the nickname of 'Family of Dragons.'Hector rushed in with a shout. The mud golem didn't back down either, and swung its fist.Wooosh!Dodging the golem's attack with nimble movements, Hector jumped into the air and struck the mug golem in the face.Whack!Cracks formed in the mud golem's face, and fist-shaped scratches were made. Coming down to the ground, Hector savagely poured out a shower of blows.Thud! Slam! Wham! Whiff!!Both arms, covered in scales, moved to the point of being too fast for the human eye and began to slaughter the mud golem. Soon after, he raised his arm violently and performed an uppercut, knocking the golem\u2019s head clean off as he roared.'I did it!'\"What the hell are you doing?! Dumbass!\"Shouted a male student as he ran past him. Hector then realized that the golem wasn't moving.Before he realized it, Simon had taken out the golem's core from behind and started running toward the mansion. Hector's face turned purple with rage.\"Simon Polentiaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"Hector put his hands on the ground, reared his legs apart, and opened his mouth. A gigantic amount of jet-black began to vibrate in his throat.'A Breath again!'Thought Simon as he put back the golem's core. Seeing Hector's stance, the other students were also running away in fright.\"You crazy bitch! Using that move while facing the mansion!\"\"Hey! Hey! I'm still here!\"When the students parted like the Red Sea, a bright red flash of light running in a straight line reached Hector.Taking the impact, Hector coughed in pain before falling backward.\"Simon!!\"When Simon raised his head, Camibarez, who was on one knee taking up a shooting position, waved her hand and was shouting.\"You were alright!\"\"Cami! You saved my life!\"\"I'll escort you! Hurry, to the mansion!\"Simon nodded and ran.But this time, there was a person on a tree who was also aiming for Simon.'I can't miss the points from defeating the Special Admission No.1'Elissa spread out her palms. One of her phantom ships opened its gunport and aimed its jet-black cannon at Simon.\"Open fi\u2014!\"Sizzle!A Dark Flame the size of a house came down from the sky and hit the phantom ship. Rocking to the side after the impact, the cannon hit nothing but ground, and fire spread across the deck before beginning to burn at a frightening speed.\"Wh-Who's that!\"Elissa screamed in shock. She saw Meilyn crossing her arms from a tree taller than her own.\"You! How could you disturb us rather than helping\u2026?!\"\"Gosh. You\u2019re a dumbass.\"Meilyn smirked and flared Dark Flame on her palms.\"I told you people aren't your chess pieces, right? My friends won't be able to enter if you block the mansion. Do you think I'll cooperate?\"\"You asshole!\"Both of them swung their arms simultaneously.Cannon shell and Dark Flame collided, creating a sound that could be heard by all.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Run!\"Camibarez rapidly fired Blood Bullets and shot down the pursuing students.The range and speed of the bullets were significantly higher than the regular explosive Blood Bullets. She looked like a sniper.With her escort, Simon could sprint in without any hindrance, and finally\u2026[Class A Simon Polentia. Entry into the house has been confirmed.]He stepped into the mansion entrance. Hearing the mansion's announcement, Simon took a deep breath and let his hands fall.\"You were late, huh?\"Lorain, who was waiting in the mansion, gave a casual wave. She was bringing her skeleton horse back into her subspace.\"A little bit of trouble came up.\"Answered Simon while wiping the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve.\"Oh my. I was last!\"Serene was approaching the mansion.Around her, a dozen students were desperately protecting Serene by blocking or standing in the way of the pouring attacks. Thanks to their escort, Serene effortlessly waltzed into the mansion entrance with soft steps.[Class C Serene Aindark. Entry into the house has been confirmed.]\"Good job, slaves.\"She snapped her fingers.The feathers attached to the students' bodies scattered in the air and disappeared. The students came back to their senses and looked around in bewilderment.\"Huh? What?\"\"Why am I here?\"Lorain frowned and approached Serene.\"Don't you think that's a cheap move? Why are you harming other students when you can get in by yourself\u2026?\"\"I used my abilities fairly. What's the problem with that?\"Serene chuckled.\"If it bothers you, why don't you whine to your mother about it? Tell her and get me expelled, please.\"\"Stop spouting nonsense. I'll never move as you wish.\"The two began to growl at each other. Simon, stuck in the middle, let out an inward sigh.'Being stuck between these two is exhausting. For real\u2026'\"Simon!\"Camibarez rushed over to Simon and grabbed his hand.\"What a relief! A huge relief! Are you okay? Did you get hurt?\"\"......\"Seeing her pure-hearted care, Simon felt his mood suddenly improving. He somehow felt deeply touched, too.'Yeah, this is how it should be.'\"I'm fine, Cami. Thank you for the help before.\"Camibarez got startled and released Simon's hand. She looked at her toes in embarrassment, then lifted her head again, and laughed.\"Now\u2026 Simon?\"Serene approached while calling Simon's name. Simon felt his body tense up as if by reflex.\"You owe me big time, right?\"\"......Y-Yeah. Thanks for your help.\"He had no choice but to admit it. Serene put her finger to her lips and gave a sly smile.\"Ahh, it's nice to feel this way at times, doesn\u2019t it. What kind of order shall I give you\u2026?\"\"I do owe you something, but it's not like I'll grant any wish or anything, you know.\"\"I know, I know. Then\u2014\"\"Simon!!\"Slam!Meilyn, who returned from her fight with Elissa, rushed in with terrifying force.She shoved Serene's face aside and stood in front of Simon. With an exaggerated scream, Serene pretended to fall, but Meilyn didn't even bother to look.\"I warned you, didn't I?! If you ever meet that woman, make sure to avoid her!\"\"Huh? Yeah.\"\"Then why are you with her?!\"\"Well, there's a long story behind th\u2014\"At that moment, Serene smiled and attached herself to Meilyn's arm.\"Kyaaah! It's Meilyn! What are you doing here?\"\"Ah, shit! Get off me!\"Something savage entering Meilyn\u2019s voice, she pushed Serene\u2019s face away once more. Serene pouted and made a sour face.\"Aww. You're so mean. Seri just wants to be friends with Mei-Mei.\"\" \u2018Seri\u2019 my ass! It's creeping me out, so stop it!\"Spat out Meilyn, disgusted. She then glared at her as though she had suddenly remembered something.\"And you fucker. You placed a feather on me before I knew it, didn't you?\"\"Hmm?\"\"Why would I attack Simon! It's your doing, isn't it?\"Serene tilted her head.\"Seri isn't so sure.\"\"Stop feigning innocence!\"Meilyn's face flushed red with anger. Serene wagged her finger side to side while speaking with a lisp.\"And Seri's ability isn't to create feelings that aren't there, but to amplify the existing emotions. The reason why Mei-Mei attacked Simon wasn't Seri's doing. You just became faithful to your own feeli\u2014\"\"Stop the chop-logic and just die!\"The two got tangled up and started fighting. Of course, rather than fighting, it felt like Meilyn was one-sidedly beating up Serene.Slam!!\"Sereeeeeeeeeeeene!\"A voice loud enough to shake the whole house was heard.\"I'm a sinful woman, after all.\"\"Huh?\"It was none other than Malcolm Randolph, the No.10 Special Admission, who strode out into the mansion.\"You son of a bitch!\"He approached without giving Serene a moment\u2019s break and grabbed her by the collar. She dropped her arms without resistance.\"How dare you manipulate me into doing such a humiliating thing?\"\"Oh my~ I have no idea what you're talking ab\u2014\"Crash!Malcolm slammed Serene to the floor. As she fell, clamor could be heard from all around them.\"......No one else could do it but you.\"Said Malcolm while angrily huffing.\"You're the only one who can insult people that way! How dare you treat me like a dog!\"Serene, who had fallen to the floor, wiped the blood flowing from her lips without saying a word.Malcolm tightened the grip on the rod in his hand.\"Ivory Tower or whatever, you need a good beating, you fucker.\"It was the moment Malcom lifted the rod. Simon, who had approached behind Malcolm's back like a shadow, gripped it tight.\"......!\"\"Stop it.\"Malcolm tried to move his arm, but it didn't budge. His bewildered gaze headed to his back.\"Who the hell are you?!\"\"This is a non-combat zone.\"Malcolm bit his lip tight and struggled, but he couldn't overcome Simon's grip.Out of all the situations, it was the one where a lot of students were watching them. Malcolm, whose face had gone red from the sudden humiliation, aimed his left hand at Simon's head.\"I'll just kill y\u2014!\"Swoop.A black dagger silently flew past Malcolm's eyes.Then, it nailed itself into the wall.Lorain, who was sitting at a table with her legs crossed while sipping juice, was staring at him with red eyes.'......Not you too, Lorain Archbold!'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *It was only the act of throwing a dagger, but Malcolm felt his body losing its strength.His grip on his rod loosened, and Simon let go of his hand.\"Dammit\u2026!\"Malcolm bumped past Simon as he left and strode up the stairs. The quiet surroundings soon filled with clamor once more as Malcolm disappeared.\"Are you alright, Serene?\"Asked Simon, reaching out his hand.Serene smiled before grabbing Simon's hand and standing up. Beside her, Meilyn, arms crossed, watched on while looking very uncomfortable.\"Thank you, Simon.\"\"That's a relief. So we can call it even n\u2014\"\"Don't tell me~\"Serene burst into laughter.\u201cYou're not gonna call it even just because you cleaned up a rat who angered a sleeping dog, right?\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t meet her eyes in guilt.'I was gonna brush over it, but I guess that won't work.'\"If you want to get a reward, take it from Malcolm. He escaped certain death just now thanks to you~\"Serene waved her hand and disappeared, leaving only those words. After that, Lorain, who had finished drinking her juice, also left while stretching her arms, saying she was going to take a shower.\"Ah, by the way, where's Rick?\"Asked Simon, looking to Camibarez.\"We were waiting, too.\"\"I thought he'd be here first.\"Now there were about 10 minutes left. The students guarding the mansion started coming in one by one.The members of Group 7 stood in front of the entrance and waited for Rick.\"Meilyn, have you even seen a glimpse of Rick?\"\"......Ah, dunno.\"She replied snappily and turned her head. Why did she seem so unpleasant?There were about 5 minutes left now. Students rushed through in the last few moments. Elissa and the students, who had been guarding the mansion until the very end, also came in.\"How dare you sink my phantom ship!\"As soon as Elissa entered, she frowned and glared at Meilyn. However, Meilyn just smirked and waved Elissa away.\"If you're unsatisfied, challenge me any time~ I'll sink all the other ships, too.\"\"Kugh\u2026!\"Elissa trembled with anger, but she saved her breath and turned her back on Meilyn. Looking at this, Simon blinked.\"You won against the Special Admission No. 7?\"\"Well, I can't say I won, but there's something called matchups.\"Chuckling, Meilyn looked like she had something to back her up.\"It's the countdown to heading home!\"The students waiting at the entrance all began to count down the last 10 seconds. Everyone tensed up and watched at the door.\"5!\"\"4!\"\"3!\"\"2\u2026!\"And when they were about to count 1, Rick leisurely waltzed into the mansion.\"Bwahaha! I made it!\"\"Rick!\"Beeeeeeeeeeep![Island Survival has ended. All students, please stop fighting and wait in a safe place.][Force teleportation will begin starting from the students outside the mansion. When the teleportation magic circle is drawn, do not leave the circle.]\"Woooooooaaaaaaah!\"\"It's finally over!\"\"Let's go eat steak instead of monsters!\"\"Anyone want to hang around Rochest in the evening?\"The students in the mansion cheered and rejoiced. Simon also smiled and gave Rick a high-five.\"What made you come in so late?\"Rick chuckled.\"I was just waiting nearby until the very last moment till it became safe. Did I really need to take a risk?\"\"It's a relief, Rick!\"\"What's safe about coming in with just 1 second left?! Gosh, you dumbass!\"Simon sat down on a nearby sofa and rested his back. Just the thought of returning to Kizen made him drowsy.Step. Step.It was then. Hector came all the way to Simon, dragging the scales dangling on his body. The three people next to Simon also flinched and raised their guards.\"\u2026Simon Polentia.\"Simon raised his head and looked at Hector.'What is he going to tell me now?'\"The monster that appeared on the southern island.\"Hector's eyes gleamed, and he continued to speak.\"Were you the one who slashed it?\"Simon chuckled and shook his head.\"You think what you want.\"\"......\"Hector stared at Simon wordlessly, then turned his back and went up the stairs.* * *After a while, all of the first-years returned to Kizen.The dormitory toilets and public baths were crowded with students. Students who had showered in advance at the mansion immediately changed clothes and went to Rochest, and there were also students looking for meals.And\u2026\"Yes, it ended without any troubles. Of course~ It's fine.\"Serene was talking to someone through a crystal ball.[How did the persuasion of Simon Polentia go?]\"Ah, that failed~\"Nonchalantly replied Serene.\"He wasn't the type of person to be intimidated or be threatened.\"[He wouldn't be a Special Admission No.1 for no reason. Then we'll proceed with our initial plan. If we start it this week\u2014]\"By the way.\"Said Serene, interrupting the man's words.\"Do we really have to kill him?\"[Yes. We can't help it. If he can't be our ally, he's just an enemy. It's better to hurry before Kizen notices and takes actio\u2014]\"Uncle.\"Looking down at the communication crystal ball, she rested her chin in her palm and smiled all the way up to her eyes.\"You're working ve~ry hard. Are you perhaps interested in being a commander?\"Bewilderment crept on the man's face reflected in the crystal ball.[Wh-What do you\u2026! You're going too far!]\"Ahaha! I'm sorry. I was just joking.\"She gently waved her hand.\"As someone who's acting directly on the field and as the successor of the Ivory Tower, I'll issue the next order.\"[What?]\"Give me a little bit more time.\"[Y-You mean\u2026!]She smiled brightly.\"Simon Polentia is an irreplaceable existence. It'd be a mistake to get rid of him to take the Legion. I'll take my time and try to persuade him slowly.\"[But\u2026! Please reconsider! The future of the Ivory Tower is at stake! Even if you're the successor, you can't decide such an important matter as you\u2014!!]\"I'll tell father directly. I'll take all the responsibility. That should do it, right?\"She one-sidedly closed the communication.As she beckoned gracefully, a feather supporting her teacup came up in front of her. She grabbed the cup and took a sip of the coffee inside.Slurp.Looking up at the ceiling and enjoying the sweet taste, she gave a strange smile.\"I'll look forward to you from now on, Simon Polentia.\"As such, the plan of Ivory Tower's extremists to assassinate Simon was placed on hold indefinitely with Serene's full authority.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Necromancer Academy\u2019s Genius SummonerCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94All of the first-years had returned to Kizen.Everyone thought the event would still affect them for a while, but when classes started back up, they found that they could return to their daily lives so quickly that the fierce days on Kera Island felt like a dream.Starting from the Cyclops Performance Assessment, to the Duel Evaluation, and then the Island Survival Assessment, Kizen's assessments all had one thing in common.They all stimulated students' desire for growth and created motivation.Students would experience a variety of emotions as they went through trials.Emotions such as envy and jealousy toward students who were better than themselves.This led to rivalry, aided by the rapid growth of the poor students considered inferior. Due to this, the class atmosphere was always good after a performance assessment.Of course, Simon was also stimulated.\"Get ready.\"One evening, just as the sun was about to set, Summoning professor Aaron was watching over Simon's restoration skills.This happened on days when they had a class related to 'restoration' in Summoning. Simon had already mastered the restoration techniques of the original course, so he had nothing more to learn in the regular class.On those occasions, Aaron took time to offer special tutoring tailored to Simon's level.\"I'm ready, Professor!\"\"Begin.\"With Aaron's signal, Simon focussed his eyes. The skeleton standing to him had its bones ripped out as they started flying toward Simon's arm.Tatatatatap!Simon's right arm started getting covered with bones. The long humerus and femur became the center, like a pillar, and small bones were densely packed between them. Then, jet-black flowed between the bones, connecting them to form a joint.This was\u2026'Bone Armor that covers only an arm!'Bone Armor was a defensive restoration technique that protected the body by making armor from a skeleton's bones. Simon simply named this type of wrapping of his arms; 'Gauntlet Mode'.He managed to succeed at it three times in a row. Now it was quite speedy. And stable, too.Excited, Simon clenched and unclenched his fist and moved his arms up and down as if lifting a dumbbell. It felt more close-packed than bare hands, but he could certainly feel the strength.'A genius is a genius after all.'Aaron, arms crossed as he watched Simon, wore a calm expression on his face, but the back of his neck was drenched in sweat.Restoration was a regular skill that could only be learned in the second year. However, Simon already created his own skill called 'Bone Nail' based on Bone Spear and raised his proficiency enough to use it in actual battle.In the end, he even completed the application skill of Bone Armor, a skill which was particularly difficult among the restoration skills.His learning speed was worth the word genius.\"Professor!\"Simon turned to Aaron and shouted,\"Can I also try hitting with this?\"\"......Of course.\"Simon stood in front of a nearby tree, heart pounding.He stood with his legs shoulder-width apart before pulling back his arm wearing the gauntlet and slammed the tree as he gave a powerful shout.Poow!Leaves fell as the sound of the impact rang out.'Woah! This is the power of it without infusing jet-black, right?'Aaron began to explain as Simon looked at his right arm in astonishment,\"As you just felt, Bone Armor holds more meaning than just defense. You can convert the skeleton's natural strength and jet-black into physical strength. Think of it as some sort of reinforced exoskeleton suit.\"Simon nodded, eyes shining.\"Bone Armor has different effects depending on the assembly type and the skeleton used. The necromancers in Kizen also have different ways of using this armor. Of course, this can't be taught. You have to research what Bone Armor is right for you.\"\"Yes! I understand!\"Aaron folded his arms.\"Then, lastly, prepare Full-Body Bone Armor.\"\"Yes sir!\"Of course, Aaron knew it. That it was crazy to have a first-year practice this right now.But still, Simon tried.Full-Body Bone Armor consumed at least two skeletons. The two being used here were broken down into their individual bones, which then clattered to the ground. The bones then flew up and clanged onto Simon's body. They were fitted appropriately across the chest, the arms, and the legs.However\u2026Crumble!While Simon was paying attention to his arm for a moment, the armor on the chest fell off.It was just a single moment where the balance between the parts broke, but it was hopeless. The entire joint ended up collapsing.Simon let out a sigh of disappointment.\"Well done.\"The result was a failure, but Aaron still gave one of his rare praises to Simon.\"Wearing Bone Armor on only one arm and wearing Bone Armor on the entire body is a whole different level of difficulty. There's no need to be impatient.\"\"Yes. Thank you, professor!\"And just like that, the private tutoring for the day was over.'Ohh, that feels great.'Simon was extremely satisfied. While packing up his skeletons, he was wishing for more days where they learned restoration in Summoning.Aaron sat down on a nearby bench and bit a cigar before lighting it.Phew.\u00a0He puffed out a cloud of smoke and opened his mouth.\"It's going to be another mission period next week.\"\"Yeah, you're right.\"Simon was eagerly awaiting the mission this time.The biggest reason for that was financial. After purchasing the golem, his wallet had become very light, and borrowing a coin or two from Rick was reaching the limit.A mission was like rain in a drought for Simon, as he could formally earn money through school.Above all, it was a stage where he could use the Legion at will without having to check on Kizen, and if he was lucky\u2026He could find a new ancient undead.Aaran asked,\"Do you have any missions in mind?\"\"No. I'll see and decide when the list comes out.\"Letting out a long puff of cigar smoke, Aaran said,\"Let me give you a tip. If you don't see a mission you like on the list, it's a good idea to just wait and see.\"\"......What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\"\"Take it literally. You still don't know much about the influence that a Special Admission No.1 holds.\"Aaron held the cigar in his fingers and continued.\"Take advantage of your position a little bit more.\"It was a secretive tip, like a riddle. Simon wanted to press for more details, but Aaron had started standing up as he tapped the ashes off his cigar and put it in the trash.\"Let's return.\"\"Ah, yes!\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *After the next day\u2019s classes, a mission bulletin board was installed in the dormitory, just as Aaron mentioned before.The students were talking amongst themselves as they looked at the request forms. You could see four bulletin boards of different colors.White - Missions within Roke Island. No possibility of encountering a Priest.Blue - Missions within the Dark Alliance. Very low possibility of encountering a Priest.Red - Missions within the Neutral Zone. High possibility of encountering a Priest.Black - Missions within the Holy Federation. Will encounter a Priest.\"Since we relaxed at Roke Island last time, I should head out this time, right?\"\"Anyone want to do a search mission in a Neutral Zone together?\"While letting the noisy voices of the other students go in through one ear and out the other, Simon and Pier carefully checked the four bulletin boards.[There's nothing! No matter how much I look, I don't see any cases where the Captains might have been involved. Tsk! Too much peace on the continent is also a problem!]'Mmm.'Simon silently nodded his head. He was just too lucky on the previous mission. It was very rare for traces of the ancient undead and the mission to match perfectly.[There's one mission that at least seems to have a possibility.]Pier's gaze turned to the black request form.[Innumerable teeth marks and a corpse that was eaten alive, huh? You can guess it\u2019s the work of The Prince, who leads the zombies\u2026 But I'm not quite sure about it with this much information. And the risk is too high for us to find out in person.]'Yeah. I've heard it's almost impossible to get Professor's permission for a black request form.'This time, he focused on high-paying missions. Simon realized it while buying a golem recently, but capital was really important for a Necromancer.'Ugh.'However, there was no mission that Simon liked amongst the high-paying ones. Perhaps it was because he earned more than 500 gold last time, so his standards went up, but all the missions were disappointing.'I guess I'll try to follow Professor Aaron's tip.'From Simon\u2019s perspective, there was no choice but to be careful. He needed a mission to earn a stable amount of money in a situation where he didn't know when the next mission would come.\"Simon! Did you pick one?\"Rick was holding a white request form again.\"Not yet. By the way, are you going for a white one this time, too? Won't it get harder in the future if you keep doing easy tasks?\"\"Tomorrow\u2019s problems are for tomorrow\u2019s me!\"Rick put his request form in his mouth, took off his uniform jacket, and slung it over his shoulder.\"Besides, isn't Kizen a place where you can be expelled at any time if something goes wrong? We need to spend every day wisely!\"\"A mission in Roke Island is what you call spending time wisely, huh\u2026?\"\"Hehehe. I have a plan. Other than that, let's go grab some midnight snacks!\"* * *The next day.Simon decided to wait without registering a mission, Camibarez took on a blue request form this time, and Meilyn said she was still exhausted from the Kera Island, so she decided to quickly finish a white mission and rest in the dorms.\"Cough! Cough! Cough!\"And the first class for today was Poisonous Alchemy.\"Cough! Cough!\u00a0I'm sorry. I'll count on you today, too!\"\"Yes, Professor. Please go get some rest.\"Lang Strauss, our Poisonous Alchemy professor, was becoming increasingly ill. He coughed out blood while teaching, and his head assistant, Francesca, was taking over more often.Recently, the frequency of him vomiting blood had increased, so Francesca even conducted theory classes. There were even times where Lang didn't appear in class at all.The students were genuinely worried about Lang's health, but deep inside, they waited for Francesca to come up to the lecture desk.Lang's class was a battle against drowsiness, but Francesca's class was as professional and dynamic as any other regular professor\u2019s. Many students were saying that Lang should retire and Francesca should take over.\"It's a bit harsh to say this, but I don't think Professor Lang is competitive in Kizen, a strict school based in a meritocracy.\"Meilyn was a supporter of Francesca, like most students.\"How can you force such a savage competition only on students and allow professors to settle on the same position despite their past reputations? Isn't that a bit weird?\"\"That's why I'm saying it's not as simple as it sounds.\"Rick was on the side of maintaining the current situation.\"If there's a change in the position of Professor in Kizen, the professor and his assistants all have to leave the school. Those positions will be filled by other professors and their assistants. It's like\u2026 an entire government changing.\"Simon nodded as though he understood, and Rick continued talking.\"Who doesn't know that assistant teacher Francesca is capable? I, too, want to listen to her classes. But if Professor Lang leaves, the teaching assistant must also leave.\"\"Ughh. That's complicated.\"Muttered Meilyn, resting her chin. This time, Camibarez asked a question.\"Can't Assistant Teacher Francesca become a Kizen professor?\"\"Realistically speaking, becoming a professor right off the bat would be difficult.\"Rick waved his fingers.\"The assistant teacher is a special position between the educator and the servants of Kizen. Technically, it's more of a class helper than an educator.\"Meilyn frowned.\"A helper? Watch your mouth.\"\"I'm just explaining the way they're recognized. Of course, It's possible for them to get into a higher position by receiving the professor's recommendation and through recognition of their teaching experience, but for an assistant teacher to become a professor right away\u2026 Well, action by someone on a Nefthis level would be necessary to make it possible.\"Step.When the sound of footsteps was heard right in front of them, Rick and the members of Group 7 all shut their mouths, their faces going stiff.Without them realizing it, the 15-minute break had ended, and Francesca came into the lecture room.And she was staring straight at Simon and his friends.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stupid Rick! Because of you again\u2026!'At that moment, when everyone was clearly nervous, Francesca walked past Simon and his friends and headed to the lecture desk.'D-Did she not hear us?'She seemed to glance at Simon and friends, even from the lecture desk, but she proceeded with the class without saying anything.\"We'll proceed to the next page.\"The way she rolled up her sleeves and tied her back long hair made her look like a gladiator preparing for battle.\"There's a famous saying in regards to poison.\"She took a deep breath and said,\"Alle Ding' sind Gift und nichts ohn' Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist. It roughly translates to: All things are poisonous and nothing is without poison - only the dosage decides the outcome.\"\"......\"\"What is poison? A chemical that contains poison? No. Anything that's harmful to humans can be poison.\"She continued, looking around the students,\"Then here's a question. Assuming you consume the same amount of spices and poisonous herbs, why might the spices end up being worse for your health?\"Class President Jamie raised her hand immediately.\"It's because the amount of poison didn't reach the lethal dose!\"\"That's correct, Jamie. 5 points.\"Jamie was visibly delighted.\"Any poison needs a lethal dose to be effective. Many poisons are used medicinally as long as they don\u2019t exceed the lethal dose. Then, on the other hand, why do you think substances that aren't poisonous aren't poisonous? Jamie?\"Hit with a sudden question, Jamie pondered for a bit with a stiff expression before saying,\"I-Is it because they don\u2019t harm the body?\"\"It's simple. It's because their lethal dose is the amount needed to make you explode and die.\"Loud laughter broke loose.\"Therefore, the basis for dealing with poisons is to accurately determine the lethal dose by analyzing the opponent. You'll have to apply a different lethal dose to poison a monster. By the end of this lesson, we will have tackled the three laws required for lethality calculation.\"Francesca effortlessly explained difficult theories one after another. Meilyn was clasping her hands in front of her face to hide her sheer joy.\"Ah~ She's so good. How can every single word she speaks be so easy to understand?\"Simon silently took notes and listened to Francesca's class. Then Rick tapped Simon's arm with his elbow.\"You're always quiet during Poisonous Alchemy. Is something wrong?\"\"Hm? Not really.\"Time passed, and the class ended. The students all packed their things and left the lecture room.As Simon was also about to leave the lecture room\u2026'Huh?'He saw a familiar person.It was none other than Jane's assistant. Simon remembered practicing his sparring with her in preparation for the first Duel Evaluation. After that spar, he felt like she was somehow avoiding him.\"Ah!\"She kept looking around, eventually finding Simon and walking up to him.\"Simon!\"\"Hello assistant teacher. What brings you here\u2026?\"Instead of answering, she asked a question.\"Have you decided what mission you're going to take this weekend?\"\"No. I'm still thinking about it.\"\"That's great!\"She grinned.\"Professor Jane called for you.\"* * *Simon arrived in front of Jane's lab along with the assistant. The assistant lowered her voice, whispering,\"Professor has become very sensitive due to recent incidents, so please be aware of that.\"\"Alright. Thank you for telling me.\"\"Then we'll go in now.\"The assistant took a deep breath, then politely knocked twice.\"Professor Jane. I brought Simon.\"He could hear a voice telling the assistant to let only Simon in. The assistant opened the door for Simon and bowed her head slightly. Simon nodded back and went inside.Jane was buried in her towers of documents as always. Apparently her primary office was in the Kizen HQ. Simon couldn't imagine how much paperwork the HQ would have if the lab had this much.\"Please have a seat.\"Jane was still moving her quill, not even glancing up.\"Yes, thank you.\"Simon sat down, balled his hands, put them on his lap, and straightened his back.Just like last time, meeting Jane was always nerve-wracking for him.\"A designated mission was sent to you, Simon.\"Designated missions\u2014unlike normal missions where any student can take it after the commissioner requests it\u2014are when an external commissioner directly designates a student to perform the task.Of course, it was only possible for a considerable bigshot or a wealthy man to have the influence to make such a request to Kizen.\"Please check the contents.\"Jane offered him a golden request form unlike the normal white or blue. Simon blinked before looking down at the form.Request: VIP guardingRequest Rank: DRequest Reward: 1,000 GoldLocation: Territory of Blue HarborDetails: Closely guarding VIP during the undead exhibition.Special Notes: Participation in the Blue Harbor Undead Exhibition is required.After reading the request form, Simon's eyes popped out of his head.'The reward is 1,000 gold for a D-rank mission?'It was twice as big as the 500 gold earned after some trickery in his last mission. As expected from a designated mission, the commission fee was on a whole new level. Above all, Simon was curious about the \u2018undead exhibition\u2019 event.\"Of course, it isn't mandatory just because it's a designated mission. Are you going to do it?\"\"Yes! Of course I'm gonna do it!\"Usually, no mission satisfied both personal interests and desired rewards.By the nature of VIP guarding, the mission's difficulty could vary depending on who the VIP was, but it was just going to be five days at most.Simon thought it was pretty doable.\"Then I'll consider it accepted.\"Jane quickly scribbled her signature on the request form and stamped a seal.\"As a matter of fact, I was thinking of sending a servant to the exhibition, but this saved me the trouble.\"\"Huh?\"\"For a necromancer of the modern era, exploring and analyzing new trends is very important.\"She presented some documents to Simon.\"While you're at it, please go take a good look. I want you to fill out these documents after the visit.\"\"This is\u2026\"It was a report. A professional report for the purposes of anticipating investment value, core competencies, and future returns.Simon was taken aback.\"Can I really write an important report like this? I'm still\u2014\"\"If you're a Kizen student, you aren't an amateur. Kizen may take the form of a school, but it's also a regular organization paying salaries.\"She put down her quill and clasped her hands.\"You are the only Kizen member going to the exhibition this time. Participate in the event with the determination of a representative of Kizen. You must never do anything that brings trouble to others.\"\"Yes, I'll keep that in mind!\"Somehow, things seemed to be bigger than he thought.A 1,000 gold mission, plus representing THE Kizen. Simon left his seat with a pounding heart.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *That night, at Pier\u2019s ruins.[Kyaaah! Blue Harbor?!]Elizabeth put her hands to her cheeks and let out a scream of joy.[It's a really famous beach resort!][We aren't going there to play around, Elizabeth.]Said Pier while wiping his greatsword with a dry cloth.[From what I've heard, that island was isolated from the mainland for a long time, resulting in a special ecosystem. We'll find new undead and make it the strength of the Legio\u2014][Commander! What do you think of this piece??]When Elizabeth touched her body, what was once a dress turned into a swimsuit. Simon's face turned red after being caught off guard.\"......Eliza!\"[What about this one?]When she touched it once more, it became a more revealing swimsuit. Simon quickly turned his head and said,\"Are you going to swim? Isn't it bad for the undead to go into the sea?\"[It'll sting a bit. Still, a vacation-resort vibe exists all across the wide beach, don't you think? I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight with all this excitement.]\"......You don't sleep to begin with.\"Pier hit the stone altar with his fist.[How pathetic, Elizabeth! How can you call yourself a Captain of the Legion with such rotten thoughts!][I think it's better than being a boomer Legion-brain killjoy.][......What? What do you mean?][I'm learning their slang these days in preparation for the situation where I have to transform into Kizen students.][I don't know what those words mean, but I feel very insulted!]\"Now, now. Stop fighting.\"Simon got up and opened his subspace. What he took out was an empty set of armor.\"This is for Pier. I ordered a bigger size than before.\"[Oh! Yes, this is what I'm talking about!]\"And Eliza. I'm telling you in advance, but I must focus on my mission. I probably won't have any time to play.\"Elizabeth, switching between one piece swimsuits and bikinis, made a gloomy face.\"Enjoy your vacation at the beach. When I'm done with my mission, I'll stop by for a bit.\"[Really?]She clapped her hands and rejoiced. Simon turned his head to look at Pier.\"What about you, Pier?\"[I'll go around the island to see if there's anything useful! Let me know right away if anything happens!]\"Aye, alright.\"Simon stretched his arms.\"I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\"* * *The next morning.Simon was the first among the Kizen students to ride the teleportation circle. This time, he teleported alone, without any other students.Whirrrrr!He was now able to find comfort in the familiar sensation.When he opened his eyes after a while\u2026'Woah.'A completely different view unfolded.In front of him soared an expansive blue sky and lay a white sand beach, with an emerald-blue ocean filling the space between.This was Blue Harbor, an island known as a nature resort blessed by the heavens.At the sudden appearance of Simon, who fell from the air, a young couple kissing nearby got startled and held each other close.Simon smiled in embarrassment and bowed his head.\"Have a nice day~\"Going to a more secluded place, Simon then took Elizabeth and Pier out of his subspace.\"You two, please avoid being too conspicuous here.\"After saying that, Simon looked at Elizabeth in a bikini and Pier in full-plated armor in the scorching sun and pressed his forehead.\"It'd be hard not to be conspicuous\u2026 Just, please, don't cause any trouble.\"[Kuhehe! Don't worry, Boy!][Freedom and happiness await me!]After parting ways with the two undead, Simon looked at the map in the request form and moved. It wasn't as big as most islands, but the more he looked at it, the more he thought it was a beautiful city.The buildings were stylish and newly built, and the streets were clean and tidy. It was worth adding that, as if emphasizing the blue in \u2018Blue Harbor\u2019, all the houses were unified in their blue paint.'Ah, this is the place.'He arrived at the destination. An exceptionally large and splendid mansion among the city's new buildings. Looking at it, he thought it'd be a place for a wealthy person who could pay 1,000 gold for a five-day escort.'I'm getting a little bit nervous.'Simon fixed his tie, touched his bangs once, and moved forward.Standing in front of the gate were two tall men who appeared to be guards.\"Ah, hello. I'm\u2014\"Tatap!The moment he arrived, the guards parted for him and bowed down to 90 degrees.\"Welcome! The Count is waiting for you.\"It seems that they recognized him immediately after looking at the Kizen uniform, not even needing to see the request form. Simon easily passed the mansion\u2019s guards.\"Bwahahaha!\"As he entered, he heard a child's laughter from the garden.He saw a boy running around with a shovel in one hand and a basket in the other. His face and clothes were covered in dirt, and two middle-aged men in butler uniforms were trying their best to stop him.\"Oh!\"Then the boy found Simon and pointed at him with his finger.\"It's Kizen! He came!\"The boy threw the shovel on the floor and rushed to Simon.\"Your clothes look super cool!\"Then he started groping around Simon's uniform with his dirty hands.Simon wept inwardly.'It hasn't been long since I washed this.'\"Hello. What are you doing here?\"\"I was playing! My name is Shun!\"\"I'm Simon. I want to meet the Count, where should I go?\"The boy smiled.\"I'm the Count!\"\"Hm?\"The butlers approached from behind while clearing their throats.\"Please have some respect. You're talking to Count Shun Oldwin.\"Simon's eyes widened.So this kid was the client who paid 1,000 gold?\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just speak comfortably when we\u2019re in private like you did before!\"\"What? I can't do that\u2026\"\"I'm telling you to do that because that's way more comfortable for me! Okay?\"\"O-Okay.\"Shun was a lively boy full of laughter. Even though he was a count, he felt somewhat more playful and modest than the typical noble kids.Simon didn't ask how he became a count and received a huge fortune at such a young age. After all, given the situation, it was pretty obvious.'His parents must've passed away early.'A boy who inherited the title of the count young and was currently ruling Blue Harbor. Simon felt his curiosity towards Shun increasing more and more.\"That's Sarah beach, where most of the tourists gather, and there's a large shopping complex past the alley over there, and......!\"Shun pointed to each of the landmarks outside the carriage and explained them one by one with his cute little hands.You could feel the affection he had for his territory in his excited voice. Simon also found himself matching the kid\u2019s tone.\"Count, we have arrived at the exhibition center.\"The coachman\u2019s voice could be heard. As Simon was listening to Shun's guide, surprisingly, they had already arrived at their destination.The moment Simon opened the carriage door, Shun flung himself out like a cannonball.\"Wait, Shun! You're gonna trip like that!\"Simon got startled and followed after him.Shun, who was hurriedly climbing the stairs, lost his balance and fell backward.Simon ran up from behind, put his arms under Shun\u2019s, lifted him up, and lowered him safely back down on the stairs.\"Oh!\"Shun smirked.\"Huh, you're pretty good at this, big brother Simon! Yeah! Keep it up!\"\"......\"Simon breathed a sigh of relief and made a forced smile. Somehow, he thought this was going to be a tough week.\"Count Shun, welcome.\"The guards standing in front of the exhibition center parted for them, making Shun spin his little body around and grin a boastful grin.\"Originally, the exhibition would open to the public the day after tomorrow. But! I'll make this a special exception for my bodyguard!\"\"Yeah. That's much appreciated.\"Creeaak.The huge gate opened, revealing the exhibition hall. Simon's eyes widened.'So this is\u2026!'The \u2018Undead of the Future\u2019 exhibition at Blue Harbor.Blue Harbor was an island that had been cut off from the continent for a long time, therefore maintaining its own ecosystem. As such, there were many unique species exclusive to the island.This exhibition focused on the undead created using the monsters of Blue Harbor, exhibiting the next generation of undead being researched. Simon could feel himself getting dizzy seeing it all.'I don't know which one to look at first!'First, there was the dinosaur-esk skeleton occupying the largest area in the center of the first floor of the exhibition center and giving off an overwhelming presence. If such a skeleton attacked someone, they'd lose their will to fight.However\u2026'Looks like they couldn't work out how to balance everything on the weight-bearing lower body yet.'Jet-black strings attached to points all over the exhibition supported the dinosaur skeleton and prevented it from collapsing. It was good that they developed a large skeleton, but unless the lower-body problem was solved, it seemed difficult to be used in practice.As Simon\u2019s thoughts drifted for but a moment to the contents of the report he\u2019d be submitting to Kizen, Shun, who was standing next to him, suddenly disappeared.\"Shun!\"Startled, Simon looked back and forth to try to find him.\"Kyaha! Hahaha!\"Before Simon realized it, Shun was riding on the back of an animalistic skeleton.\"Giddyup! Giddyup! Go! Let's go!\"When Shun slapped the skeleton's back with his palm, the skeleton turned its long head to look back at Shun.'Th-That's dangerous!'It seemed that it wasn\u2019t just a simple display, having been imbued with summoning magic.Simon ran forward, a cold sweat going down his back.He vaulted over the safety fence with one hand and focused jet-black into both legs.'Jet-Black Stepping!'As Simon's body soared up, the skeleton also widened its maw and approached Shun.'I'm faste\u2014!'Whish!Simon's arms trying to cover Shun grabbed nothing but air. Before he realized it, a green liquid had wrapped around Shun's waist and was pulling him back, leaving Simon to fly head-first into the skeleton.'Ouch!'Simon fell to the floor while clutching at his face.\u201cCan a so-called bodyguard take their eyes off the VIP like that?\u201dA man was approaching under the dim lights.Large slanted eyes, prominent eyelashes, small nostrils, and a long mouth. One hand was tucked into a pocket, and the other had turned into something like liquid, holding onto Shun.As the man let Shun down, Shun shouted with a broad smile,\"Uncle Pinch!\"The man called Pinch turned his hand back to normal and stroked Shun's head.\"You need to be careful, alright? There are also moving undead here, so it's dangerous.\"\"I'm telling you, it's fine! Ah, let me introduce you!\"Shun pointed at Simon and said,\"The strongest bodyguard from Kizen! He's Special Admission No.1, Simon Polentia!\"\"Mm.\"Pinch rubbed his chin and looked up and down Simon. Then, he smiled and held out his hand.\"Name's Pinch Nickiman. I'm a necromancer too.\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *\"I\u2019m Simon Polentia.\"The moment Simon grabbed Pinch's hand for a handshake, Pinch\u2019s hand melted. Simon felt himself jump on the inside, but he remained silent and pocketed his feelings.\"Hahaha! It's just a prank, a prank!\"Pinch brought his hand back to normal, shook the hand lightly, and then put it back into his pocket.\"You're a first-year student who came to earn some pocket money, right? I don't know what kind of naive thoughts you had while coming to this resort island, but you gotta do your job nonetheless. Is that correct?\"He was reprimanding Simon for not properly protecting Shun. At that, Simon placed a clenched fist over his heart and bowed deeply to Shun.\"Please forgive me for my negligence, Count.\"Pinch's eyebrows twitched.\"Ah, big brother Simon, what's wrong?!\"Shun grabbed Simon's trouser leg and shook it.\"And stop scolding my bodyguard, Uncle! That just then was my fault!\"\"Haha, what do you mean by scolding? I was just giving my dear junior some advice.\"Pinch cooked up a good reason and glanced over at Simon.'Look at this kid\u2026'Pinch placed Simon as a delicate young master who was wet behind the ears, but it looked like he had some temper.As Simon raised his head, Pinch cleared his throat before saying,\"So yeah, I heard that you're a Special Admission No.1 in Kizen?\"\"I am.\"\"The expectations of someone in your position must be high. Some advice as your senior; don't assume that all the knowledge you gain at Kizen is the ultimate truth. To be honest, Kizen is somewhat acting up these days. In the past, it truly was a legend, but the current education system feels a bit\u2026 old-fashioned, and\u2014.\"\"Excuse me, Pinch, but are you\u2026\"Interrupted Simon.\"...a Kizen graduate?\"\"......\"The corner of Pinch's smiling lips twitched.\"Ahem. No, I started from the public necromancer school of Alland.\"\"Ah, I see.\"\"You'll probably see them soon, but the top students from Alland, Sierra, and Moyran are sometimes transferred to Kizen. They are more competent than the existing Kizen students in every way possible!\"Simon smiled brightly.\"Woah, that's great! To be more competent than Kizen? Then, wouldn't it be unnecessary for them to transfer to Kizen?\"'......Is this bastard for real!'He smiles like he doesn\u2019t, but he secretly gets on people's nerves.However, Pinch couldn't slander Kizen directly, so he had no choice but to swallow his anger.\"Ahem. Everyone has their own pros and cons. Don't you agree?\"\"Yes, you're right.\"\"Uncle Pinch! Hurry up, hurry up! You said you'd introduce the undead to me and big brother Simon!\"\"Ah, right.\"Pinch quickly managed his expression.\"Let's stop talking about student-level topics. Isn't the real beginning of your career as a necromancer after graduating? I'll show you the workings of a professional.\"\"I\u2019m looking forward to it.\"Said Simon, and he lightly put his hand on Shun\u2019s shoulder. Shun looked up at Simon, as if asking what was up, but Simon said not a word, opting to only smile.The look in his eyes spoke for him instead.\u2018Don\u2019t you dare run off again.'Shun shivered.\"Come on, you two. I'll start explaining this design first.\"As expected from a necromancer of Blue Harbor, Pinch was a pioneer in the research of the future undead. There were a total of 100 works in the exhibition center, and 20 of them were Pinch's.Hearing Pinch's explanation, Simon was honestly astonished.Forgetting his personality and character, he was faultless in terms of skills. He used the monsters of Blue Harbor to build undead with novel functions at high quality.'But since it's an event to showcase completely new undead, they\u2019re somewhat off in terms of practicality.'Some undead were so helpless that there was no way to use them at all. So, even with his shallow knowledge, Simon picked out some parts and commented on them.\"Wouldn't it be better to cover the tail of this rocker worm skeleton with protein or chitin rather than forcing it to connect with bones? At this rate, swinging it a few times will overload the joints, and you won't be able to use them.\"At Simon's critique, Pinch\u2019s face turned red, and he replied rather sensitively,\"Ahem. What does a first-year student know anyway? Every process has a purpose. Just because you spit out ideas without thinking doesn't mean that the reality of it can be solved!\"\"Ah, I see. I'm sorry for stepping in.\"Pinch pulled a notebook out of his pocket.\"So, where did you say would be nice to cover up with chitin?\"\"Huh?\"They walked around the exhibition center while talking about various things. Already bored of this, Shun yawned.Seeing this, Simon poked Pier's clone.'Pier, you there? Please help me for a while.'[What is it?]While Pinch was frantically explaining and Shun was yawning, Simon took off Pier's clone from his school uniform and held it out to Shun.\"Shun, look at this.\"\"What's this?\"\"It'll move if you poke it, you know?\"Shun poked Pier's clone with his fingertips. Then Pier said in fright,[What do you think you're doing! I'm not a toy!]\"Woah! The skull is opening and closing its mouth when I tickle it!\"\"Isn't it cool?\"[Boy! Get him off me right now!]\"What happens if I pinch it like this?\"As Pier played with him for a while, Shun quickly regained his concentration and excitement. And just like that, they went up to the fifth floor of the exhibition center.\"Now, I'll reveal the highlight of this exhibition.\"When Pinch removed the white cloth, a large fish tank revealed itself, and inside was a skeleton unlike any Simon had ever seen before.Its body was alien in nature, looking like a mixture of a jellyfish and a octopus. It was made of bones, and a soft liquid was floating around it to maintain its form.The most unique part was that the long legs of this jellyfish monster were made of pure bone. It looked like a mechanical leg with a well-fitted clamp, but it was definitely bone.\"Mollusca Undead Overlord.\"Pinch wiped the smile off his face, returning to his serious tone as he said,\"The ingredient used was a deep-sea kraken. It looks similar to a squid, a type of mollusc, if it lived in the deep sea, and strangely, the core structure of the body is composed of bones, so the conditions for a skeleton are met. Moreover, this corpse was not even an adult. No adult kraken has ever been captured yet, you see.\"Pinch placed his palm on the magic circle. With a whir, the Overlord began to move.'That's insane\u2026!'Simon was so surprised that he lost control of his expression.Its six long legs made of bone moved freely like the tentacles of the flexible squid. Simon never knew bones could bend so much.\"It has speed as well as cutting power.\"When Pinch took out a sheet of iron from his subspace and lifted it over his head, the Overlord saw it and moved its legs.Shiiieeek.As the long leg from the fish tank drew a straight line through the air, the iron plate was neatly split in half. Then, the second leg that followed pierced the center of the fallen iron plate.'Woah!'As a Summoning student, this was like torture for Simon. To think he couldn\u2019t use such a great undead when it was right in front of him.When Pinch gave a signal, the waiting staff put the cloth over the tank once more.\"Pinch.\"\"Yeah? Do you have any questions?\"\"If someone wanted to buy this undead, how much would it cost?\"Pinch smiled and placed a hand on his hip.\"Is that a question coming from a Kizen? Or\u2026\"\"No, no. It's just a personal question.\"\"Well, this is research of astronomical value. It's not for sale, and it doesn't belong to me. But if I still had to name a price\u2026\"After giving it a bit of thought, Pinch said,\"It'd cost at least 10,000 gold.\"\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt like he could write pages upon pages in the report about the Overlord with ease.\"You did a great job today, big brother Simon!\"Said Shun on the carriage ride back to the mansion.\"Tomorrow's bodyguarding mission will begin at the dinner banquet at the exhibition center.\"\"Dinner banquet?\"\"Yeah! As the exhibition\u2019s guests, we will be having dinner with the Oldwin family and the distinguished guests. And, starting from the day after tomorrow, the exhibition will be open to the public.\"Simon nodded.\"I was planning to go to work early in the morning.\"\"It's fine! You\u2019ll have nothing to do even if you come early. You just have to come two hours before dinner.\"The welfare was better than Simon expected for a 1,000 gold mission.So the carriage arrived at the mansion, and Shun went in along with the butlers while waving back to Simon.All accommodation expenses during his guard duty were borne by the Count. The head butler even said it was okay for Simon to stay at the mansion, but Simon refused.There was something he wanted to practice alone in a quiet place.As such, the lodging that Simon decided on was a hut a little far from the central area of Blue Harbor.A small, single-story house overlooking the night\u2019s ocean. It was cheap, and there were few people at night, so there was no problem even if undead walked in and out.[Now, Commander! Ta-dah!]In order to please Elizabeth, Simon dined with her over a glass of wine in the evening. He also released the corpse spiders to freely roam the sandy beach and suck the blood of insects and small animals.As soon as they finished eating, Simon returned to his room in solitude.'There's not a moment to lose.'Simon's goal was to raise his proficiency with Bone Armor during this mission.He took a deep breath, cleared his mind, secured enough jet-black in his body, and stood up. Then, he took out two skeletons from the subspace and placed them on his left and right.'Bone Armor!'Rattle!The skeletons started to disassemble, and they began to stick to Simon's body.He didn't even expect it to reach the level Aaron showed him in the past, the level where it completely covered the body. The most important thing was whether or not it could be connected to the limbs and bring out the effect of strengthening the whole body.'Focus. Focus.'It wasn't difficult to build a pillar with large bones, but the balance suddenly weakened when the small bones started to settle.To succeed with Bone Armor, it was necessary to pervert the sequence of bones that Simon had learned from both theory and instinct. The lower vertebrae would pop into the arms, and sometimes the leg and neck would be forced to fuse together.What made it worse was\u2014since two skeletons were being used\u2014the bones of different skeletons were interlocking at random.Overcoming such a creepy sense of difference, the bones had to be deliberately joined to match the shape of 'armor.'Clatter!He lost focus. The ribs, which had been neglected while he concentrated on the arms, collapsed, and other connected parts fell like dominoes.Simon fell to a knee, gasping for air.\"Huff! Huff!\"'It really is difficult. Not even activating the mud golem can compare to this.'He wondered when was the last time he felt such a high wall in Summoning.'One more time!'Simon jumped up and tried to form Bone Armor until it worked.[Commander~ Aren't you hungry already? I brought you some midnight snacks!]Elizabeth, who had come in with a plate of food in one hand, stopped. Then, she hushed the corpse spiders following her.The spiders that had been following her with a place of juice and pudding atop their bodies stopped too.[Commander is a huge busy bee when it comes to practice after all.][Ssshhhk!][Don't get excited. It's not the type of bee you guys eat. Idiots.]Elizabeth quietly closed the door.* * *\"Big brother Simon! You're here.\"Shun, dressed in a neat formal suit, welcomed Simon as he entered the banquet hall.\"Hm? Why do you look more tired after I gave you a break?\"\"No, I'm fine.\"Simon forced a smile.In fact, he was a little tired after spending most of his break time on the Bone Armor training. However, he had taken a nap since then, so he had enough rest to carry out his mission.\"Other than that\u2026 Should I also change clothes?\"\"What are you talking about when you're wearing exactly what you need to?\"Said Shun while pointing at Simon's stylish Kizen school uniform.\"I guess doing your hair just a little will help.\"As Shun snapped his fingers, Simon felt a hand roughly grabbing the back of his wrist. In an instant, Simon was seated in a chair next door, making him stutter out,\"Wh-Why are you doing this?\"\"I'm going to do your hair. It'll sting your eyes.\u201dPshh! Pshh!A middle-aged woman in a maid dress started spraying something over Simon's head.Simon quickly closed his eyes, as it really did sting his eyes. Shun followed after and playfully giggled,\"Woah! Brother, your scalp stretches just like dough!\"\"......Be quiet.\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *After finishing working on Simon's hair, he and Shun moved into the banquet hall.In front of the antique tables, freshly cooked food was displayed brilliantly in a buffet style. Even the smallest dishes seemed expensive.\"This is where we'll stay.\"He took Simon in front of the indoor fountain, not far from the main entrance of the banquet hall. Shun sat down by the fountain and continued talking.\"When guests come, you just have to welcome them, greet them, and send them inside.\"\"Yeah, I understand.\"\"I believe the guests will also say a thing or two to you seeing the Kizen uniform you're wearing, big brother Simon. You just have to play along! You can do it, right?\"\"I'll try.\"Simon fixed his tie and resolved himself. Then, the head butler, who was standing at the front door of the banquet hall, said,\"Count, the guests are coming in.\"\"Yeah! Let's get started.\"The main gate opened, and a gentleman in a suit and a lady in a dress came in holding hands. The butler announced,\"Sir Kinola Oldwin and Lady Sophie Oldwin are entering.\"If it was Oldwin, they were from the same family as Shun.Simon quickly recalled the information about this situation in his head before reading the atmosphere.The couple stood in front of Shun.\"Welcome, Uncle!\"\"Haha! Glad to see you, Count Shun.\"The two exchanged simple greetings. Shun didn't pay the due respect first, perhaps because of his position as Count.'Now, let's focus.'The Dark Alliance had different formalities and ceremonies in each country.Currently, the alliance consists of four kingdoms.The Dresden Kingdom, with Langerstine as its capital, is nearby Kizen.The Baldwin Kingdom, where Simon's hometown of Les Hill is.The Kallos Kingdom, where Simon's first mission site, Arnish, belongs.And the northern Shahed Kingdom, which, although belonging to the alliance, carries a strong sense of isolation.Blue Harbor is a territory of the Baldwin Kingdom. Simon was well aware of the formality on this side.After the conversation, the couple then came to see Simon.\"Uncle! This is the special admission no.1 student from Kizen!\"\"Ah, so he is\u2026!\"\"My name is Simon Polentia.\"Simon smiled softly, bowed his head, and shook the hand of Kinola. And to the lady, Simon gently gave a light kiss to the back of her hand.\"We're so thankful that a Kizen student is making our family's exhibition shine.\"\"It's all thanks to the call from the Count. I am honored to be here.\"After exchanging a few more words, Simon again straightened his back and bowed.In any case, Simon came as an escort, and he only greeted the two of them because the Count himself introduced him. It'd be rude to talk too long. The couple then proceeded to the banquet hall as though they knew that too.\"The Lord of Galan, Baron Ryan Darby, is entering!\"Simon's head spun rapidly. If it was Galan, it was the territory of the Dresden Kingdom.Simon greeted the man using Dresden\u2019s code of etiquette this time.About ten guests came in one after another, but Simon was feisty. The way he responded quickly according to the opponent's nationality, status, and gender was beyond skillful, and was even dazzling.When Shun saw that, he was also shocked, and tapped Simon on the leg.\"What's this, brother? How do you know this so well?\"\"I learned etiquette the hard way from my father, you see.\"Simon learned it by getting beaten every time he made a mistake. At that time, he wondered why he had to learn all that in a rural estate, but there was no such thing as meaningless learning. Simon kept a constant smile the whole time and entertained the guests.\"I'm sorry, I'm on a mission to guard the Count.\"\"I'm honored to be here with the grace of the Count.\"\"Yes, it's all thanks to the Count.\"\"Wouldn't Count Shun know better than me?\"Kizen school uniforms stood out everywhere they went, so some people were more interested in Simon than Shun. Every time Simon greeted someone, he took himself step down and thoroughly built Shun up.The reason why Shun's Oldwin family hired him for this mission and paid a whopping 1,000 gold.He knew it very well.He was a splendid trophy to illuminate this event with the reputation of Kizen's special admission no.1, and he symbolically showed that Kizen's special admission no.1 guaranteed the title of Shun, who had just inherited the family name.'As you expect, I'll do the work of 1,000 gold.'No one could look down on Shun in this place.Simon focused on keeping Shun as the main character by keeping himself as a supporting actor. The family members and the butlers also smiled at Simon's actions.\"He's really thoughtful, unlike the youngsters these days.\"\"Yeah. He knows his position very well.\"\"He has a great personality, and he's respectful to his elders. There's a reason why people are eagerly seeking Kizen graduates.\"\"Shh, shh. Sir Pinch might hear us.\"Then the butler looked around.\"Now that you mention it, where is Sir Pinch?\"* * *At the same time.Pinch sneaked out of the banquet hall and looked around to see if anyone was around. Then, he pulled out a communication crystal ball from his pocket and said in a calm voice,\"It's me.\"[We departed as planned. I believe we'll reach Blue Harbor the day after tomorrow.]\"Got it. Everything\u2019s going smoothly here, too. All the main family members are gathered in the banquet hall.\"[Everything\u2019s going smoothly? According to our information network, I heard a rumor that bothered me.]The man's voice was cold.[The rumor that a Kizen student has entered Blue Harbor.]\"Ah, there's no need to worry. Even if he's Kizen, he's still a first-year rookie, so he's barely a variable. If you're that worried, I'll take care of him by myself, so no need to worry.\"[A first-year, huh......]Pinch scoffed.\"Why are you getting scared now?\"[Don't provoke us, Necromancer. Whoever the opponent is, we'll wipe them clean, leaving no traces behind. Of course, as long as the payment is certain.]\"Of course. I, Pinch, will guarantee it.\"A wide grin spread across his thin lips.\"Everything on this island shall be yours.\"\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Simon, who participated as a bodyguard, didn't directly partake in the ceremony, instead standing at a distance and guarding Shun.'Phew, this is hard.'He had practiced Bone Armor until the opening ceremony began in the afternoon.Simon was recalling the conversation he had with Pier during yesterday\u2019s training.\u201cBy the way, Pier, can I use Bone Armor with your conscripted skeletons, too?\u201d[It's not necessarily impossible. However, don't even think of doing it for a while.]\u201cWhat? Why?\u201dAt that time, Pier's clone was smirking.[Because it'll be a bad habit.]Pier was also Simon's mentor.So far, listening to Pier has never led him astray, so Simon focused once more on mastering Bone armor using summoned skeletons.The sound of applause Simon woke up from his thoughts. The opening ceremony was finally over.The people on the stage went their separate ways as they started to talk to one another, and Simon stuck to Shun's side to guard him.\"Simon! Do you have something on your mind?\"\"Hm? Nah, it's nothing.\"At that moment, the gaze of the opening ceremony\u2019s host turned to Simon. Simon smiled, as if asking what was going on, and the host announced,\"Now that you mention it, a student from Kizen was also here! Did everyone know that?\"The chatter within the crowd grew louder.\"Of course, we must listen to the words of a person who's with the highest authority in this field, right? Now! Let's welcome him onto the stage!\"Woooooaaaaah~A loud cheer erupted.Simon looked at Shun with an awkward expression. The host's gaze was also turned to Shun.\"Would that be okay, Count?\"Simon made a face as if asking Shun to spare his life, but Shun just gave a playful laugh that showed his teeth before pushing Simon forward.\"Of course!\"\"Well, this'll be an extra interview! Please, come over here, student of Kizen!\"So this is how it turned out.Wearing a bitter expression, Simon was pushed onto the stage.'Wow.'There were a lot of people. Looked like the exhibition was a hot topic within Blue Harbor, too.\"Please give us a brief introduction!\"The host held out the magic megaphone to Simon. He was speaking so loud that he wouldn't need the megaphone to be heard.\"My name is Simon Polentia, a first-year Summoning aspirant from Kizen.\"\"Ah, I think you're missing the most important part.\"The host winked playfully and wagged his finger. Simon let out a little smile and continued.\"I had the honor of enrolling in Kizen as a special admission no.1.\"Loud chatter broke loose from the audience.Simon felt how the way people looked at him changed drastically at his words.\"You must've gone in at least once while guarding the Count, right? How was the exhibition?\"Simon roughly finished reading the mood.Although it was an opening ceremony, it wasn't rigid like noble culture. Instead, it was full of vitality and energy, like an entertainment event. The unique, free atmosphere of a vacation island must've been reflected.Simon thought to himself that he should adjust to the mood, too.\"I can say with confidence that this is one of the best undead exhibitions I have ever been to.\"'Although this is my first undead exhibition.'\"Blue Harbor is one of the few places with an ecosystem that has evolved independently. For me, as a necromancer, the fact that this kind of ecosystem wasn't destroyed and is instead being preserved under the name of the Oldwins is a great fortune. The undead made out of the creatures of this island seemed like technology from 20 years in the future.\"A slightly stronger diction and a more exciting expression.\"In particular, I highly recommend taking a look at the Overlord of the last floor.\"\"Oh! Looks like you wanted this \u2018Overlord\u2019!\"At the host's joke, Simon returned it right away.\"As a matter of fact, I couldn't help but ask the person in charge about the price during my duty.\"\"How bold! S-So, how much is it\u2026?\"\"I gave up because its starting price was 10,000 gold.\"Hahahaha!The mood of the opening ceremony suddenly brightened up. The host and Simon raised the mood by talking back and forth at high speeds.Tap! Tap!Then, from the back, the head butler started tapping his watch. The host\u2014who had been bullying Simon with mischievous questions such as if he has a girlfriend in Kizen\u2014got startled and ended the question.\"Ah, would you look at the time! We ask for your interest and support for the new undead exhibition, which will be held in 30 minutes. And! Once again, a big round of applause for Kizen student Simon for taking the time to participate in the interview!\"Ardent applause erupted from all over the place.\"It was my honor. Thank you.\"Simon gave a final wave to the crowd and then returned to Shun's side. Shun giggled and tapped Simon's leg.\"Big brother Simon! You were better at speaking than I thought!\"\"\u2026Than I thought? That's a compliment, right?\"\"Hahaha!\"After a while, the exhibition hall opened, and thousands of people lined up to look at the exhibits.In this time, Shun and Simon went around the exhibition hall to greet and guide guests who they couldn't meet at the banquet on the second day.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *The morning of the fourth day.Simon's schedule for today was similar to the third day. It seemed like most of the time would be spent in the exhibition hall. Simon and Shun were on their way to the exhibition in the early morning in a wagon.Simon folded his arms as he looked out the window.\"It's cloudy today.\"\"I know. Wouldn't a lot of people come to the exhibition?\"A thick fog blanketed the entire beach. In fact, tourists who came to the beach to swim were instead panicking because of the unexpected weather conditions.\"Why is there suddenly a fog like this\u2026?\"\"It's not even raining.\"\"Should we just stay in our room all day today?\"In fact, the janitors of Blue Harbor were roaming around.They told people that swimming would be restricted, as the sea fog was so intense that it covered the sandy beach. Tourists were walking away from the beach while grumbling.\"Alright, I'm going.\"People who had been resting on parasols also moved toward the city.\"Hey, hey, by the way, don't you see something strange over there?\"\"Yeah, we're seeing it. The fog.\"\"No, beyond the fog. Over there\u2026 I wonder what that is.\"\"Stop blabbering nonsense, and let's go already. I'm hungry.\"But the clamors on the beach grew louder and louder. Even screams and urgent shouts telling the people to run away started to get mixed within.Swaaaaaaaaaa!Everything happened in an instant. A giant, jaw-dropping sailing boat breached through the thick fog.A flag fluttered atop the sails of a sailing ship. Two swords crossed underneath a distorted skull.This flag symbolized one thing.\"I-It's a pirate!\"\"Piraaaaaaaaaaaate!\"The peaceful beach went into a state of total panic in an instant. Terrorfied, people started screaming and running.Kabooooom!Gunfire shook the sky. Shells fired from warships detonated on the pillars of tall buildings in the city. A stone building crashed to the ground, and its supports caught fire.Boom! Kaboom!Some shells fell on the beach. Sand burst up, and people were swept away.\"Dodge! Dodge it!\"Countless shells tore through the mist and wind. The beach and village became a site of disaster in an instant, fires burning within them. And soon, a huge ship entered the beach.Craccckkk!As the pirate ship came to the ground, flinging up the sand in its path, a pirate began to climb down the ropes.\"Kuhehehe!\"Sitting in a chair on the deck, a man with a long beard laughed. Holding up a communication crystal ball, he said,\"2nd and 3rd ship. Cover the island from the left and right and beach! Don't let anyone escape!\"[Aye!]Large sailing ships of the same size were seen splitting left and right in the fog.The man stood up. You could see pirates retreating all at once and bowing their heads to pay their respects.\"Blue Harbor, huh? It's a nice island.\"Shing!As he drew his sword, he shouted,\"What are you all doing? Everyone, land! Wipe out every last one of them!\"\"Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"* * *Simon and Shun, who were in the exhibition hall, also went out, hearing the gunfire that shook the sky. Somebody mumbled in shock,\"Oh my god\u2026\"A gigantic pirate ship that arrived with a thick sea fog was firing shells all over the city. Blue Harbor was becoming a living hell.\"They aren't an ordinary group of pirates.\"Said the butler in a cold sweat.\"Judging from the size of their ship or the flag, they're pirates of the pearl sea. They aren't the type to come to a peaceful ocean, so why\u2026?\"\"The admiral has arrived!\"A man in a uniform with a bunch of badges hung on it walked out of the exhibition hall.\"\u2026No way.\"He muttered with a face completely displaying his disbelief.\"How did a pirate ship get to the shoreline? What is the shoreline guard doing?!\"The admiral hurriedly took his communication crystal ball out of his pocket.\"Guardpost! Answer me! Guardpost!\"Silence.Hastily changing channels, the admiral tried contacting somewhere else.\"It's me, the admiral! Answer me right now!\"But all three seabourne forces protecting the sea didn't respond.\"I-Is the communication off all of a sudden? Because of the fog?\"\"They're probably just in a situation where they can't be contacted.\"Said Simon with a stiffened face. When the admiral turned his head to see who in the world was intervening, his eyes widened when he saw Simon's uniform.\"K-Kizen\u2026!\"\"What do you mean by a situation where they can't be contacted, big brother?\"Simon let out a small sigh in response to Shun's question and said,\"It means they've already been defeated.\"* * *Blue Harbor Sea Force Headquarters.\"Kuhugh!\"\"Cough, cough!\"Armed soldiers were puking and collapsing one by one. The whole building was covered in a thick, green smoke.The 2nd barracks of the Blue Harbor Sea Force.\"What the fuck did you put on the foo\u2014!\"\"Kugh!\"They were all lying on the floor with black liquid dripping from their mouths. Some soldiers were struggling to endure it, but the artificial slimes scattered on the floor came and devoured their bodies.And lastly, the 3rd barracks.There was blood everywhere. Unnaturally bent corpses of soldiers lay in pools of red blood, and the walls were covered in the traces of battle.And\u2026There was a man leisurely smoking a cigar among the corpses of over a hundred soldiers.\"I told you, it would've been better for the both of us if you just comfortably died of my poison, right?\"The robe he was wearing was all covered in blood, but the man didn't even blink. He picked up the communication crystal ball.\"How's the ship?\"[We burnt them all.]\"You mustn't let anyone escape the island. Especially\u2026\"Blue Harbor's strongest necromancer made a terrifying smile.\"You must make sure to catch Count Shun and the Oldwin family, no matter what.\"\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unless something also happened to him.\"At those words, the maids muttered amongst each other in fright.The situation was even more hopeless now that even the necromancer of the Oldwin family, who could be called the strongest, couldn't be contacted.\"It\u2019s like that Kizen student said. Something seems to have happened in the headquarters.\"Concluded the admiral, putting his communication crystal back in his inner pocket.\"However, the troops on site must still be fighting. I'll somehow gather up the remaining forces to form a defense line.\"Shiiing!The admiral drew his sword from his waist, and other soldiers followed suit, drawing their weapons, too.This time, it was the head butler who opened his mouth.\"Then we'll find an escape rou\u2014\"\"It's more dangerous to head out of the island by boat. The pirates would've blocked the waterways.\"Interrupted Simon before stating,\"The post and the entire Sea Force have been completely neutralized. This is a plan that has been in the works for a long time.\"\"Ahem.\"The air became heavy. The admiral spoke again.\"I agree with the Kizen student once more. If all the sea outposts were neutralized, there would be no escape. I think we have no choice but to hold out on this island.\"Then, he looked to Simon.\"Kizen student, can you please help us? You'd be a great help here\u2026\"\"I don't mind, but......\"Simon let out a bitter smile, looking at Shun, who was still clinging to his legs. Simon was on a bodyguarding mission. Shun was his top priority.\"Big brother Simon.\"\"Yes, Count?\"\"I'm\u2026 fine.\"Shun, who separated himself from Simon, slapped himself on the cheek. Then, he opened his eyes, revealing determination beneath.\"I'm asking you as both an administrator of Blue Harbor and as a client. Don't worry about my safety, and please save the people.\"Panicked voices were heard all around them. Simon knelt down and looked Shun in the eye.\"Shun, something feels off. There may be people after you.\"\"It's more urgent to save the people who are in danger right now. I'll pay any additional fees, so please\u2026\"Shun bowed his head, even as he trembled.\"Please save Blue Harbor and its citizens.\"\"......\"He seemed to have made up his mind. He may have been small and young, but Simon thought that he truly had inherited the title of Count.Simon also bowed his head.\"As you wish, Count.\"* * *The force was divided into three.Shun, along with the head butler and the family's guests, decided to head to the mansion and hold out. The mansion had its own defense facilities, and some butlers could fight.The Sea Force admiral decided to head toward the barracks with his soldiers. It was an urgent task to reorganize forces by retrieving the scattered soldiers.And Simon was\u2026Step. Step.He was alone, heading toward the beach where the first pirate ship had landed. Simon judged that there was a high possibility that the captain was at the largest and fanciest of the three pirate ships.If he could suppress the captain, the rest of the small fries should be disrupted, and if he combined his power with the remaining soldiers in the Blue Harbor Sea Force, the situation should somehow be resolved.'Pier! Can you hear me?'Ever since the pirates started their invasion, Pier's clone hadn\u2019t spoken a word. It seemed that the other side got involved before Simon did.'Let's just do what I can do for now.'A terrible hell unfolded before him when he passed through the mansion gates and entered the city of Blue Harbor.The beautiful city has been turned into a sea of fire because of the bombardment, and screams of pain and the cries of people facing crises far beyond them were all that could be heard.As Simon moved forward through the thick smoke and scorching flames, he finally found a group of residents near the fountain.Some Sea Force soldiers were fighting the pirates, but they couldn't put up much of a fight, and collapsed due to their lacking numbers.\"Please! Anything but that! That's my father's\u2014!\"\"You're making me sick.\"A man begging over his father's belongings was kicked, and fell to the floor.A scene of absolute plundering. The pirates scoured the buildings and took valuable items, and if the residents resisted, they wielded their weapons without hesitation.\"Hey, hey! Aren't you going to lower your sword?\"\"You dirty bastards\u2026!\"A lone soldier was confronting the pirates. The pirates were threatening him by putting their swords at the necks of citizens.\"Huh? Are you really not going to lower your sword?\"Slaaaaaaash!One captive fell to the ground as blood spurted from their neck after the pirate at the back sliced it open.\"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"\"Dear!!\"\"Are you still not gonna lower it?\"Next was an old man, and then a young man. They fell down in fountains of blood. The captives were screaming out of fear.These pirates weren't just taking the captives hostage.They were playing.'These bastards really are insane.'The soldier trembled.He could never know how many more people would die if he charged. He lowered his posture and pretended to put down his sword.\"W-Wait! I'll put it down! I'll put it down, so calm dow\u2014!\"Whack!A pirate approached from behind and struck him in the back of the head. The soldier crumpled on the spot.\"Kyahahahah!\"\"Too easy, too easy!\"The pirates approached and began to stomp down on the prone soldier.\"Can't you even tell the difference between real war and limited warfare? You have to fucking fight no matter how many captives drop dead!\"\"Bastards who're fattened up by peace!\"Simon, who was watching from behind a building, bit his lip.It wasn\u2019t that hard to beat up a few pirates, but if he rushed in, the lives of the captives were at risk.Moreover, a powder keg was placed between the captives kneeling in an alley. The pirates ordered the captives to hold the keg, and people trembled as they were forced to gather around it.At that moment, Pier's clone spoke into Simon's mind.[Boy! Can you hear me!]'Pier! Why were you so late?'[A pirate ship has come this way! I'm engaging them right now!]'Will you be fine by yourself?'[Kuhehe! It's a piece of cake! By the way, you successfully cast Bone Armor with a summoned skeleton for the first time yesterday, am I right?]\"Yeah, I did! What about it?\"Pier's clone smiled.[Then I shall grant you this permission! You can use the conscripted undead as Bone Armor. As many as you want!]Pier's message ended with that. His voice cut off, so maybe he entered the fight again.'Alright.'Simon didn't know what Pier's intentions were, but he had no other options.He summoned a large number of conscripted skeletons from his subspace.Then, he recalled the image in his mind to raise his concentration.'I can't concentrate well.'He could see sparks fluttering in the wind and falling.'It's still too fast.'Simon clenched his teeth.His mind was elevating. As though consciousness transcended the body, his senses started to become more and more detailed.'Get slower. Get slower. Get slower.'Slowly, the speed of the sparks falling slowed down. Now, it all looked like slow-motion to him.Simon nodded and slowly appeared from behind the building.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - RamenProofreader - Artethrax* * *Wham!Whack!The man who had been plundered of his parent's belongings was being kicked by pirates over and over again. Angered, Simon flicked his right arm toward him.'Bone Armor!'The bodies of two skeletons disassembled and flew toward the man.\"Wh-What?\"The pirate panicked and retreated.The flying bones began to stick to the man's body one by one. The arms, legs, and chest bones connected into neat rows.Simon then finally realized it.Why Pier was preventing him from practicing Bone Armor with conscripted skeletons.'This is so much easier!'This didn't require any practice in the first place.The conscripted skeletons, each carrying consciousness, knew exactly where the bone armor should be aligned and slotted together.All Simon had to do was finetune the whole thing. It was like Simon completed the blueprint, and the skeletons looked at it and put themselves together.If you mastered Bone Armor using the summoned skeleton, you could also naturally master the conscripted type.Ta-tap!Tap!Click!The man wearing the Bone Armor staggered. The bones that flew from the air went into the hollow armor and clicked into place.He looked down at himself with bewildered eyes. Before he knew it, his whole body was covered in armor made of bones.\"Wh-What did you do?!\"The pirate kicked the man's chest out of panic, but thanks to the bone armor, it didn\u2019t hurt one bit.At that moment, the man's body moved completely on its own and punched the pirate's face.Pooooooow!With the unbelievable force, blood spewed from the pirate\u2019s nose as he spun thrice in the air, and then rolled on the ground. His teeth glistened under the sunlight and flew out of his mouth.\"Hey! What's going on?!\"His pirate comrade saw it and ran to him.Pow!This time, the fish shop owner struck the pirate in the head, embedding the man\u2019s face in the wooden box next to him.\"I-I didn't do it! Why is my body moving on its own\u2026?!\"Flutter!The bone armor that covered the fish-shop owner was peeled off and moved on to the next person.\"Kyaaaaah!\"\"Stay still!\"\"Please don't do this!\"A rough-looking pirate was harassing a female tourist.When the pirate, who had lost all reason and succumbed to his primitive desires, licked his tongue and tried to take off the female tourist's clothes, the skeleton bones started clinging to her body.\"I told you not to do it!!\"She slapped the Pirate's cheek while crying.Then\u2026Slaaaaaaaaaap!The pirate's body flew up a few meters and fell to the floor.She was surprised and covered her mouth before looking at her palms.\"Just kill this bastard right now!\"\"Trample on him!\"Simon's arms moved frantically.He made the soldier who was being stomped on after being struck on the back of his head wear the Bone Armor.\"H-Huh? This bastard is standing up!\"\"He still had the strength?\"The soldier pushed himself up with his hands even though five men were trampling on him. No matter how much the pirates stomped on him, it was only their feet that hurt.\"Huufffff!\"Soon, the soldier shouted out and shook off the pirates, making them fly like bowling pins before rolling across the floor.\"You bastard!\"A pirate approached and swung his sword.But with a loud clang, it hit only the boney armor that the soldier was wearing. It was as if the armor was alive.\"I mean, what the hell is that!!\"Since the attack didn't work, the soldier felt tremendous courage rising within him. He grabbed the pirate's head and rammed it down on the floor.Poooooooow!The floor tile was smashed, and the pirate's head was stuck in the remains.\"Haha\u2026 Hahahaha!\"Unbelievable strength. The soldier looked down at his body in disbelief.\"Get out of therrrre!\"A young lady jumped three meters up and kicked a pirate with a flying kick, smashing the pirate into the treehouse behind him.\"You trashy pervert bastards! I'll kill you all!\"Crunch!The florist started to bare-handedly swing the wagon he usually hefted along at the pirates.\"Finally, the powers I had in my early days have awakened! Back in my day\u2026!\"Suddenly, there was a huge counterattack from the residents. The citizens who had suffered one-sidedly suddenly exerted tremendous power while dressed in skeletal armor, overwhelming the pirates.\"Y-You bastards!\"One pirate ran in the front of the powder keg where the captives were tied and lifted the torch in his hand.\"Get down on your knees, you crazy bastards! Otherwise, I'll blow these bastards sky\u2014!\"Crush!The pirate's eyes glazed over, and he fell to the floor.An old man had crushed the back of the pirate's head. After dusting off his hands, the old man smiled as he looked at the bone armor covering his skinny body.\"Old man!\"Shouted Simon, who appeared on the street.\"Please put that away!\"The old man looked at Simon and quickly grasped the situation.\"So you're the one who put this on me! Got it!\"The old man threw the powder keg into the garbage heap in the empty square, where it was safely detonated!\"Huff!\"Simon, who had reached the peak of concentration, crossed his arms in the air. The old man's Bone Armor was released and put on the body of a man fighting the pirates.\"I've been waiting for this!\"The man blew apart a pirate with a single uppercut.'Right side.'The man's Bone Armor was removed, and it flew into the air this time. A woman holding her child was falling down a four-story building, escaping the flames.Bone Armor was put on her body, absorbing the shock of her fall. The woman stood up fine.'Left side again.''Recover two suits and bring them to the square.''I need to put more power on the fountain side.'Simon's fully immersed Bone Armor control was almost like a work of art.His arms were moving frantically. He repeatedly put on and removed the armor on the residents being attacked by pirates.'There can be no more casualties. I'll save every last one of them!'Simon's eyes widened. Ten sets of bone armor were busily roaming the city, helping people.Now people noticed the identity of the person moving the mysterious suits.\"Isn't that lad from Kizen?\"\"Yeah! It's that person who was interviewed at the exhibition!\"\"Kizen is helping us!\"\"Waaaaaaaaah!\"Citizens who had been one-sidedly attacked by pirates were pumped up. Now, there were even people who volunteered to dress themselves up.Simon took full advantage of them.\"Mister! Please wear this and take care of the pirates in the alley!\"\"Okay!\"\"Sister! Two pirates right in front of you!\"\"Leave it to me, kiddo!\"The tides of the battle quickly shifted. The pirates were being pushed back by the hands of the residents, who weren't even trained.\"Look over there! It's the doings of that boy!\"\"Get him first!\"A few pirates found Simon and rushed in.Simon was completely unaware of his surroundings, as he was concentrating on putting Bone Armor on people far away.\"Hey, dodge it!\"\"Careful!\"The people crowded around him surged into a clamor.
