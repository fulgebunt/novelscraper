The reason he hated them so much only because\u2026He roared at the man who was crying like his parent died or what in his chest, \u201cCan\u2019t you be a fucking man?! All you know is cry. Do you think it can solve any problem?\u201dThe young man who was crying in his arms was his second elder brother Rong Qi, three years older than him. The biggest habit of his brother\u2019s was dressing up and searching for romantic relationship on a daily basis. What really bothered him was that his brother was only into handsome men.Rong Qi raised his exquisite face with delicate make-up, \u201cYi, I got dumped. What should I do? He dumped me. I don\u2019t want to live. Boohoo\u2026\u201dRong Yi was so angry that his veins on his forehead popping out. The Rong family was one of the biggest cultivation families in Longcheng City. Anyone in the family was highly respected in the city. He, the third son of the Rong family, was especially a big figure because he was a well-known almighty cultivation talent. How could he have such a loser second elder brother?\u201cWas he the only fucking man left in the world? You cry for a man who had lower status and less good-looking than you. What are you? Huh?\u201dRong Qi sat up right away and punched Rong Yi in the chest as he was in a huge pain while his brother was still so mean to him, \u201cYi, you are a devil! I am already sad enough, while you still yelled at me instead of comforting me. You are the worst! Boohoo\u2026 You are so bad.\u201dRong Yi had a spur to strangle him now!At this time the door was pushed open and five 5-year-old kids who looked alike flocked in, \u201cwe are back.\u201dPiu\u2026Piu\u2026 The headmost boy shot Rong Yi right at his head and face with a toy gun in his hand.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s anger built up to the maximum.\u201cBoom! Bam\u2026\u201d The second boy threw a toy grenade at Rong Yi then.This time Rong Yi dodged away. The third and fourth boy kept shooting at Rong Yi with their toy guns, which made Rong Yi lose his temper.\u201cYoung master, they are just kids. Calm down.\u201d persuaded the butler as he sensed that Rong Yi was about to lose his temper.The four naughty kids were Rong Yi\u2019s brothers. Two years ago, Rong Yi\u2019s parents left for travelling around the world and hadn\u2019t come back yet after they left the 3-year-old quintuplets to his biggest brother Rong Zhi and him.Rong Yi took a deep breath and told himself not to get angry, not to hit anyone. They were just kids. They couldn\u2019t stand his punch.\u201cYi.\u201d The youngest sister approached him with a big suitcase behind her.She was the only daughter in the family. Rong Yi was less angry as he saw her. He tried to make a grin at this precious sister, \u201cXin, what can I do for you?\u201d\u201cCan we play cosplay?\u201d Rong Xin opened the case and gave him a black woman\u2019s court dress, \u201cthis is for you. You play an evil queen and I will play an innocent, kind princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s eyes twitched as soon as he saw the off-the-shoulder court dress. This was why he hated gay, kids, losers and sissy pants.Rong Qi\u2019s phone rang all of sudden. When he clicked open it, he screamed, \u201cAh!\u201d\u201cDamn you! What are you fucking screaming for?\u201d yelled Rong Yi as he and the quintuplets were startled.\u201cSo gorgeous! I have never seen such a gorgeous person before! Yi, look.\u201d Rong Yi passed his phone to Rong Yi.\u201cHandsome man\u2019s picture your funny friends sent to you? I am not interested. Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Rong Yi got stuck as he had a glimpse of the screen.It was a picture of a man who was lying on one side on bed, wearing a suit of purple enchanting ancient Chinese dress, like he was indifferent to anything judging from his facial expression while he had a pair of seductive eyes. His long dark hair was swept back randomly but elegantly.Anyone could be stunned at the first sight.\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t he gorgeous?\u201d As Rong Yi was amazed, Rong Qi looked rather cocky, \u201care you amazed how beautiful a man could be? Hello, Yi. Stay with me, Yi. Are you fallen in love with him? Yi. Yi\u2026 \u201dRong Yi came to senses as he heard Song Qi\u2019s voice. But the moment he opened his eyes, he saw an incoming punch before his eyes. He avoided quickly and saw three men and two women in ancient robes who were looking at him amusingly.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

And where am I?Rong Yi noticed that he was standing in an ancient building which would only be seen on TV instead of a modern room at home. It must be sorcery that Rong Yi\u2019s fynny friends casted on him.\u201cWow! The sissy pants can avoid my punch. Impressive!\u201d the man standing in front of Rong Yi smirked, \u201cdid you use your breast-feeding-men strength?\u201dThe other two men laughed out aloud.\u201cBrother Quan, don\u2019t waste your time. Give him senior sister apprentice\u2019s wedding invitation so that he can give up forever.\u201d said the girl behind that man with disdain.\u201cOk.\u201d Quan Feng then took out a red invitation card from his chest pocket and patted it on his palm, \u201cshe asked me to give you the invitation. Two month later, she and your senior brother apprentice are going to get married at the Destiny Peak of our Taiyuan Sect. You are welcome to attend their wedding. But since you are already a few months pregnant, you\u2019d better not come. Otherwise you would give birth on the wedding because that would too much for you to take.\u201d\u201cBrother Quan, maybe we can invite a midwife to the wedding. When he gives birth, take off his pants and show the entire sect how a man gives birth to a baby.\u201d Mocked the others.\u201cGood idea.\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t pay attention to what they were saying. All he cared was to get out of the illusion someone cast on him.\u201cCatch it, sissy.\u201d Quan Feng threw the invitation card at Rong Yi right in the face.As soon as Rong Yi came into senses, he clinched the invitation card with two fingers. However, he fell down on the floor as he couldn\u2019t feel any support from his feet, and then threw the invitation back at Quan Feng quickly and powerfully like throwing a dart.As Quan Feng didn\u2019t expect that Rong Yi could throw the invitation back and so hard, his face was cut deeply by the card.\u201cAh!\u201d He touched his face and then saw blood on his fingers. He and his peers were shocked that the weak Rong Yi could hurt him with a piece of paper, \u201cson of bitch! How dare you hurt me!\u201dThen Quan Feng pulled out of his sword.At this time, a man yelled from a distance, \u201cQuan Feng, it\u2019s you again! You are asking for death to bully my young master at my place!\u201dQuan Feng and the others were mortified when they saw it was Rong Su, personal guardian of Rong Yi. Rong Su was a level 9 Base of Practice while they were just at the entry level of Base of Practice. They couldn\u2019t defeat him altogether combined. So they ran away soon after they trash-talked \u201cRong Yi, we will see\u201d.\u201cAre you ok, young master? Are you hurt? Did they punch you? Did they say anything mean? Don\u2019t listen to them. They meant to upset you on purpose. Don\u2019t let them win.\u201d Rong Yi marched forward and carried Rong Yi in his arms, jumped and hopped in the air a few times, then landed at the backyard, carried him onto the bed, saying \u201cYoung master, are you hurt? I need to make sure. I have to get a midwife to confirm it. Wait here. I will be back soon.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d Before Rong Yi said anything, Rong Su already dashed out like an arrow.What the fuck?! What did he say? A midwife?Isn\u2019t a midwife supposed to assist in childbirth?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat the fuck?! Am I giving birth to a baby? Fuck! Rong Yi, when I get out of the illusion, I will skin your fucking friends.\u201d Rong Yi looked at his big belly bump, which was the size of nearly 8-month pregnancy.He struggled to sit up and looked around the antique room. Usually if a man realized he was struck in an illusion, the illusion would go away by itself. But why did the illusion still exist? Maybe he needed to finish the tasks in the illusion first?Rong Yi walked to the table and bit his finger, drew a level 3 Illusion-breaking Rune with his blood on the table. As he tried to insert his spiritual power into the rune, he could barely feel his spiritual power which was as low as he was at the Qi Practicing stage, the entry level of cultivation.\u201cHow is it possible?\u201dRong Yi looked at his hands and couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. He was a cultivator at the Golden Elixir stage. His spiritual power should be far more powerful than this. Did anyone cast Anti-spiritual-power Formation on his family?No! It was impossible.They had access control to his house. Anyone who entered his house had to be someone the family knew, who had to go through identity checks and security checks. When the guards confirmed that he was safe with his belongings, he could enter the house.Besides, all levels of patrol guards were patrolling around the house. In addition to the protection of senior formations and high-level seniors, there was no way to cast Anti-spiritual-power Formation without alerting anyone in the family.Rong Yi rubbed his forehead miserably. What else could it be if there was no illusion or Anti-spiritual-power Formation? Is it possible he has transmigrated in here?On thinking of transmigration, his whole body went stiff. No way! How could it be?One of Rong\u2019s ancestors time travelled once. That ancestor had transmigrated to a different world while he was reading an ancient book. He spent over a thousand years in that world and finally figured a way to come back. When he came back, it was only a few minutes past in this world. No one believed him. Then he took out the treasures from his Storage Ring and taught the family how to practice new skills he learnt from that world. It was then that people believed him. From then on, the Rong family got stronger day by day.\u201cThey are not my hands.\u201d Said Rong Yi when he looked at his hands.His hands were not as delicate as these ones which should belong to a baby.Then he saw a bronze mirror by the bed. As he walked toward it with haste, he almost fell down again. He always had a feeling that something ain\u2019t no right of the feet. But right at the moment he didn\u2019t give it much thought. He quickly picked the mirror. It was a beautiful face in the mirror, long bushy eyebrows, big and clear eyes, imposing nose and rosy and thin lips. That face was more beautiful than any movie star he had ever seen. He was surreally succulent like the face had been photoshopped.No way! Is it possible he has transmigrated into a woman\u2019s body?He immediately felt his chest but paused as he was afraid this body really belonged to a woman. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he still reached his hand for the breast part slowly.When he felt nothing, he was much relieved, \u201cthank goodness. It\u2019s flat.\u201dNot yet! A lot of girls were flat-chested nowadays. Besides, the body seemed to belong toa 16 or 17 years old person maybe, not fully developed yet.He got intense again. He tried to look at his crotch but got obscured by his big belly. Gritting his teeth, he reached for his crotch and touched the thing that was unique to a man.\u201cWoohoo\u2026\u201d He exhaled a long breath, \u201cthank goodness. Thank goodness.\u201dAll of sudden, he felt pains in the belly as if someone was kicking him from inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ouch!\u201d Rong Yi sat down slowly as he supported his painful belly, \u201cDamn it! Am I really pregnant? Are you fucking kidding me? How can a man get pregnant? No way. It must be beer belly.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even believe what he comforted himself because he could feel clearly that something was kicking him from inside.\u201cI am back, young master.\u201d A young man in white walked in and talked slowly without any haste as he saw Rong Yi sitting on the floor with painfully pale face, \u201care you having another belly pain?\u201dRongHuan felt Rong Yi\u2019s pulse as he squatted on one knee. A long time later, he got nothing.Rong Yi couldn\u2019t help asking in a huge pain, \u201csay something.\u201d\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t worry. The little master is sound.\u201d Rong Huan let go of his hand.\u201cI don\u2019t fucking want to hear this!\u201d yelled Rong Yi.What he wanted to hear was that he got this big belly because he ate the wrong food.It was the first time Rong Huan heard the young master spoke vulgar language, so he was a little startled, \u201cGiven your situation right now, you should wait at least two years to give birth.\u201d \u201cWhat the fuck! Did I hear it wrong or you said it wrong? It still takes another two years to give birth to a baby?\u201d Rong Yi was shocked.Is he pregnant with a Nezha?\u201cYoung master, I am back.\u201d Rong Su ran into the room with a midwife in his arms and then put her down, \u201cplease check our young master. I will go prepare some hot water.\u201dThe midwife who was still suffering from the shick held the desk, heavily panted while patting her chest\u201cI\u2019m nearly scared to death! I\u2019m nearly scared to death!\u201dJust a few moment ago when she was still helping a woman give birth, a man broke in and took her away without saying anything. Then he hopped swiftly through roofs by carrying her in his arms. Anyone could be scared by this.\u201cRong Su, he is not due yet.\u201d Rong Huan still talked as slowly as usual. When he finished his sentence, Rong Su was already in the kitchen. But Rong Huan was used to his brother\u2019s fast speed. The rune on the table attracted his attention. It looked like a three-level Illusion-breaking Rune but it was different from those he had seen before. It was revised easier to draw. He wondered if the revised rune could work the same.\u201cYoung master. Who draw the rune on the desk?\u201d asked he, eyes narrowed.\u201cI did.\u201d Answered Rong Yi impatiently.Rong Huan frowned. Apparently he didn\u2019t believe what he said. Having served the young master for four years, he had never seen him practice a bit, let alone drawing runes.As the midwife caught her breath, she helped Rong Yi sit properly and checked his belly to see if he was really going to give birth.\u201cGo away!\u201d Rong Yi slapped away the midwife\u2019s hand, \u201cboth of you, go out! I need to some privacy.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The midwife immediately left.Rong Huan stepped out of the room after he cleared the rune.Rong Yi looked around the room again and pinched himself in the arm, \u201chiss, it hurts.\u201dApparently he was not in a dream as he could feel the pain. But he still couldn\u2019t believe it, \u201chave I really transmigrated? But all I did was to look at a picture of a handsome man.\u201dIn fact, transmigration was not a problem, as long as he could find a way. But now he was a pregnant man. How could he walk in public now?Did it mean he had to walk around with such a big pregnant belly? Or even worse, he had to give birth to a child?Bullshit! He didn\u2019t want to give birth to a baby! No! He had to find a way to solve the problem.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHaving been lying in bed for two hours, Rong Yi finally accept the fact that he actually transmigrated. He sat up with eyes closed for meditating why his spiritual power was so weak. After all, he needed a strong spiritual power that could take him back to his own world like his ancestor who had transmigrated back after becoming an immortal.After quite a while, Rong Yi opened his eyes and exhaled a long breath. Luckily deep in the pubic region was not damaged. The most positive thing was that this body had the exactly same Spiritual Cohesion Root, mutated Blade Spiritual Root and Thunder-fire Spiritual Root.Normally the spiritual root in one cultivator with three properties was called Miscellaneous Spiritual Root which was not usually good for cultivation. It was more difficult to promote than Single Spiritual Root and Pure Spiritual Root. At a certain stage, those with Miscellaneous Spirit Roots couldn\u2019t promote anymore.Rong Yi\u2019s situation was different because he had an awesome Spiritual Cohesion Root which enabled him to absorb the aura from the nature anytime anywhere under any circumstances and helped him promote his cultivation at a fast speed. For example, those with Heavenly Spiritual Root and mutated spiritual root could cultivate at the speed of breathing, then those with Spiritual Cohesion Root could do it in the blink of an eye. That was why cultivators wanted it so badly.Most importantly, Spiritual Cohesion Root could transfer spiritual power freely. With it, once could switch to evil cultivation or ghost cultivation at any time. Only that it took some time during this process.Rong Yi wouldn\u2019t worry about his cultivation thanks to Spiritual Cohesion Root, not to mention he had two mutated spiritual roots. The mutated spirit roots could speed up the cultivation alone. With the help of Spiritual Cohesion Root, his cultivation would be rocketing fast. Before he transmigrated here, he could have promoted up to the stage of Immortal Refining but the seniors stopped him from promoting too fast.There were nine stages of cultivation: Qi Training, Base Practicing, Golden Elixir, Nil Infant, Immortal Refining, Void Purifying, Power Generating, Grand Convey, and Doom Overpowering. There were nine levels at each stage. When cultivators exceeded the ninth level, they could promote to next stage. Promotion to next stage could be dangerous. There were odds to fail. With one failure, it got extremely hard to get promoted again.Although Rong Yi was just at the Golden Elixir stage, he was top genius of the geniuses among his peers. There were no more than ten cultivators in the whole country who could reach at the Golden Elixir stage under 25 years old.His spiritual root was special because it was undetectable, meaning that no one could detect his root no matter how hard they tried. In fact, those with undetectable roots were no inferior to those with Heavenly Spirit Root or mutated ones.When he checked the body he was in now, the root was also obscure to detect. He could barely notice its presense unless he tried really hard. Perhaps it was why the original owner of this body gave up cultivating. The Spiritual Cohesion Root didn\u2019t take full effect without cultivation, although it helped absorbing spirit which could only keep him healthy and help him recover from wounds faster than common persons.When he was little, he was taken as someone who had no spiritual root either.\u201cSucker! What a waste of such a great gift!\u201d yelled Rong Yi.Even if he had no Spiritual Cohesion Root, he could still stand out with the mutated Blade Spiritual Root and Thunder-fire Spiritual Root.Cultivators with sword skills usually had Gold Spiritual Root. Those with sole Gold Spiritual Root, in particular, could intimidate their peers when they reached the Void Purifying Stage. Unfortunately, they were extremely weak before that. They got a lot of bullies before that. That was why few cultivators chose sword skills.The scenario was different for those with Blade Spiritual Root. They had powerful sword Qi even before they cultivated. When they started, they achieved the most with less effort. They could easily be five times faster than those with Gold Spiritual Root and their sword Qi could be more powerful than those with Gold Spiritual Root.When Rong Yi reached at the Golden Elixir stage, he almost practiced his sword skills all the time because he thought Blade Spiritual Root was more powerful than Thunder-fire Spiritual Root. Given time, his Thunder-fire Spiritual Root was used as assistance root which helped him refine weapons or elixirs. He hardly did those jobs at home because he was lazy and they had elixir makers and weapon forgers in the house. When he needed to augment the offense of his devices, he would use his Thunder-fire Spiritual Root to enchant them. People with Thunder-fire Spiritual Root were very rare in the world.\u201cDinner is ready, young master.\u201d Rong Su shouted outside the door.\u201cGot it.\u201d Responded Rong Yi.He stood up and fell down on the floor all of sudden. He had to grab the bed to protect him from falling.\u201cWhat the hell! What\u2019s wrong with my feet? Why do I fall so often?\u201d Rong Yi sat down on the bed and checked his feet, only finding his feet were only about 3 cun (a unit of length: one cun equals about 3.33 millimeters) long!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhy are my feet so small?\u201d Rong Yi saw the instep arched one time higher than normal people\u2019s feet and the toes were like a awl-like shape which could even be used to drill the wall.He took off his shoes and the cloth that was wrapped around his feet. He couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. \u201cCould these\u2026even be called feet?\u201dThe instep arched high up and four toes were folded under except the big toe. It was ridiculously ugly.It was foot binding that he saw on TV.\u201cWhat the fuck! I am a man with foot binding?!\u201d Rong Yi wished he could just die. What kind of man this body used to be?Or did every man in this world bind their feet? But the guardians had normal feet.Right now his first priority was definitely his feet. Only if he could walk normally, he could do things. The problem was that he had no idea where he had transmigrated now. If he was in a cultivation or superpower world, he could heal his feet very soon, otherwise he had to reach at the fifth level of Qi Training first, which would take a couple of months.Song Yi then asked Rong Su who was guarding outside in.At the moment Rong Su laid his eyes on the bare feet of Song Yi who was sitting on the bed, he immediately turned around and said, \u201cwhat can I do for you, young master?\u201d\u201cGet me a doctor to cure my feet.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s doctor?\u201d Swiftness scratched his head as he didn\u2019t know what it meant.\u201cHealer? Physician? Understand?\u201d\u201cRong Huan is a physician. I will go get him.\u201d Rong Su then flew out using his Lightness Skill and brought Rong Huan back in a minute.\u201cWhat can I do for you, young master?\u201d At the moment Rong Huan saw Rong Yi\u2019s bare feet, he also immediately looked down on the floor.\u201cCan you fix my small feet? Unfold the four toes and make my feet back to their original sizes.\u201d Rong Yi stretched out his feet.Rong Huan remained silent with lowering his head.\u201cSay something!\u201d Rong Yi was pissed off by this slow coach.\u201cYoung master, didn\u2019t you say that only your husband can see your feet?\u201d Said Rong Su facing back at him.It reminded Rong Yi that he had a husband who spent every night with him in bed, the man who impregnated the original owner of this body. Did it mean he had to sleep with him at night too?What the fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!Rong Yi got goose bumps all over on thinking that he would have sex with another man. He even had the urge to kill him.He\u2019d better cure his feet and leave this place ASAP.\u201cIgnore whatever I said before. Come check out if you can cure them.\u201d\u201cBut you used to care a lot about your small feet, young master. You are proud of them. Why do you want to make them back to normal size?\u201d hesitated Rong Su.Rong Yi rolled his eyes in his mind. So the original owner of this body was proud of small feet? Ridiculous! \u201cYes, I used to. But now I want to cure them. If you can\u2019t do it, get somebody who can.\u201d\u201cI can correct them but it is painful.\u201d Rong Huan raised his head and looked at his feet.\u201cAs long as you can cure me.\u201dRong Huan grabbed Rong Yi\u2019s right foot on one knee, and pressed the instep slowly downwards with his spiritual power. One could even hear the cracking sound as the foot was reshaped.Rong Yi was sweating in huge pain and his face was turning ghastly pale. But he felt relieved cause the other party culd cure him soon since he got the spiritual power.As his 3-cun(1 cun equals 3.333 cm) foot would be reshaped to the normal size, the atrophied skin and flesh started to crack, even with some veins broken.After Rong Huan unfolded four toes from down his sole of the foot, he took some healing ointment from his Space Ring, \u201cYoung master, the bones of the toes are necrosis. It takes some time to heal.\u201d\u201cFor how long?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cAt least half a month.\u201d\u201cWhat?! It needs so much time? My ass would be fucked rotten.\u201d With this weak body, there was no way that Rong Yi could disobey his husband in bed. However, Rong Su and Rong Huan had no idea why he was saying that.\u201cYour medicine is not good.\u201d Rong Yi sniffed the ointment and then said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYoung master, although Rong Huan is just a level 2 pharmacist, he is superior to others in the same level.The medicine he develops is the best at his own level. How can it be no good? IBut if you compare it to those from higher levels, his medicine might be really not good enough.\u201d Rong Su argued.\u201cI mean it is lack of one herb which makes the medicine take effect slowly. I didn\u2019t mean to judge Rong Huan\u2019s ability.\u201d explained Song Yi.Although he didn\u2019t refine elixirs or forge weapons back at home, he learned a lot as the seniors didn\u2019t want him to waste his talent.\u201cWhat did I miss out?\u201d asked Rong Huan.He refined the medicine according to level 2 prescription. Even superior level physicians used the same prescription. There was no way he would miss anything.\u201cRotten Vine.\u201d Said Rong Yi.\u201cRotten Vine?\u201d Rong Su\u2019 eyes were wide open, \u201cas far as I know, it is a kind of toxic herb. People with weak spiritual power would die after taking it by accident. I have never heard that it could cure the bones.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d as a physician, Rong Huan never heard of it either.\u201cRotten Vine is severely toxic and its venom spreads fast. It could crawl through human body tightly and twine the bones like a vine. Rong Huan, you can toxify-free it before you use it to refine the medine. With the help of its spreading speed and bone-twining effect, it would enhance the efficacy to a new level.\u201dWhat Rong Huan used before was the traditional prescription. The Rong family improved the prescription by adding Rotten Vine in it.\u201cWhen you refine the medicine, get rid of Recovery and Bone-connecting herbs and add Rotten Vine instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Huan was surprised because Rong Yi explained very clearly, but he had never learned anything about herbs. And what amazed him was that what Rong Yi said made sense. He even suspected he might have lost his mind.\u201cIs it doable?\u201d Rong Huan was astonished.\u201cRong Huan, you can give it a try. Remember to use it on me as soon as you make it.\u201dAfter Rong Huan reshaped Rong Yi\u2019s left foot and applied medicine onto it, he stood up and walked out of the room.\u201cThese are real feet.\u201d Rong Yi was satisfied with his normal-size feet, then raised his head andl ooked at Rong Su, \u201cbring my food in my room and prepare a few pairs of new shoes for my normal feet.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Rong Su left the room quickly and caught up with Rong Huan. He assumed that Rong Huan was upset as he was like pondering with his head hanging down. He then comforted him, \u201cHuan, don\u2019t be upset. You know the young master knows nothing about herbs. He had no idea if your medicine is good or not. He may hurt you because he was mad at his senior brother apprentice\u2019s wedding. He even made his small feet back. He must be really mad this time.\u201d\u201cBut I think he has a point.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Rong Su stood there in a shock.As Rong Huan got into the elixir refining room, he collected all the bone-healing herbs he needed together with toxic-free Rotten Vine but without adding Recovery and Bone-connecting herbs. Then he put everything into a pot to cook for almost one hour. This time the ointment carried a thicker spiritual power than before and its cure was one level higher. And the refining speed also doubled since one kind of herbs was removed from it. Most importantly, Rotten Vine was cheaper than Recovery and Bone-connecting herbs. He could use the spiritual stones on other herbs.He couldn\u2019t wait to try it out on Rong Yi.\u201cWell done.\u201d Nodded Rong Yi with satisfaction as he smelt the ointment.He applied the ointment to his feet which recovered at a fast speed. The rotten toe bones got healed.\u201cThey are getting better.\u201d Smiled Rong Yi as he moved his toes.Rong Huan checked his toes with spiritual power. He was surprised that the toes were perfectly connected. It turns out that Rotten Vine is more effective than Recovery and Bone-connecting herbs. And it is poison-free. It also protects bones from damage again as it tightens the joints.\u201d\u201cYoung master, may I know where you learned the prescription, sir?\u201d asked Rong Huan.\u201cI just overheard it.\u201d Rong Yi put on his shoes quickly, \u201cI got no time talking to you guys. I need to go out.\u201dHe had to leave before the husband of the original owner of this body came back.\u201cWhere are you going? Do you want me to come along?\u201d asked Rong Su.\u201cNope.\u201d How could he get out of here if someone was with him?\u201cBut you haven\u2019t put on any makeup yet.\u201d Said Rong Su.He used to dress him up exquisitely before he went out.\u201cNo time for that.\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s corners of his eyes twitched.\u201cYoung master, slow down. You might scare the little master in your belly.\u201d Shouted Rong Su while Rong Yi was walking in haste.\u201cWhat the hell! Shut the fuck up!\u201d Rong Yi nearly sprained his ankle.He finally managed to forget about the baby. Now this stupid asshole reminded him again!Damn it! The original master of this body was even more girly than his second elder brother. At least his brother wouldn\u2019t get pregnant or have foot binding.Rong Su then smiled awkwardly, \u201cYoung master is really badly hurt this time. He even speaks swear words like a real man. But at least better than being so sassy as before.\u201dRong Huan, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRong Huan, I heard our master is about to come out from his cultivation. Right?\u201d asked Rong Su.\u201cYes. I heard it too. He will be here by today or tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen the young master and his little son yet. He will be very happy if he sees them.\u201d Chuckled Rong Su.\u201cHe might before.\u201d Said Rong Huan, \u201cmay not now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a man, he neither cultivates nor finds himself a job. All he knows is learning make-up and getting himself dressed up like a woman. And he even has foot binding like women in the mortal world. Ew! So goddamn gross! What is worse, this sissy pants gets pregnant like a woman.\u201d\u201cIs it possible that a man can get pregnant?\u201d asked a man who didn\u2019t know Rong Yi surpringly.\u201cLook at his big belly. That is the proof that he is pregnant and it\u2019s already been four years. He was\u2026\u201d Rong Yi couldn\u2019t hear what the man said because they gradually lowered their voice. But he was terrified enough when heard the master of this body had been pregnant for four years\u2026Four years! Plus two years due as Rong Huan said, it meant he carried the baby for six years, even longer than the legendary immortal Ne Zha\u2019s mother who was only three-year pregnant. Not sure if the baby would be more powerful than Ne Zha.\u201cWeirdo. Disgusting.\u201d People all tried to avoid him.Rong Yi didn\u2019t care what they said at all. But out of blue, he felt a little sad and wronged He could even feel water in his eyes. He might cry out on spot if he didn\u2019t try to restrain it.He rubbed the corner of his eyes, confused, \u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201dHe never cared about what others said about him. But why did he feel so upset now?Was it because the residual consciousness of the original owner of this body feels upset on hearing those people which also affected his mood?\u201cFuck!\u201d Rong Yi came before a small pharmacy filled with pent up anger. There was no customer in there.Rong Yi walked in waveringly and said, \u201cExcuse me, medicine for abortion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you again for abortion medicine?\u201d asked the shopkeeper with a smile.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo the original owner did actually try to abort the baby for quite a lot of times. But why was baby still there?\u201cChilde Rong, no offense, but your belly is already this big. You and your baby might be in danger if you take abortion medicine now. You should think it through.\u201d Persuaded the owner as he was busy filling the prescriptionIt was an honest advice. Rong Yi felt his big belly and said, \u201cthen I will have a level 1 Health Protection Elixir and a level 1 \u00a0Rejuvenation Elixir.\u201dThese two elixirs would secure his safety when he took the abortion medicine.The shopkeeper sighed helplessly and then took out two elixirs, \u201cChilde Rong, 50 low grade spiritual stones in total, please.\u201dRong Yi subconsciously touched his pocket. But the silk gown reminded him that he was wearing his outfit in modern times. He felt in his chest, then his sleeves, and then check if there was something like Space Ring on him. Finally he realized that he made a stupid mistake. He didn\u2019t bring a wallet with him when he ran out.There was a reason he forgot such an important thing. Back in modern world, his family took care of everything for him every time he went out. When hung out in the city, all he did was to swipe his face, because no one didn\u2019t know that he was the third son of Rong family.But now\u2026\u201cCan you swipe my face?\u201d asked Rong Yi sullenly.\u201cHuh?\u201d The shopkeeper looked at him confused.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any spiritual stones with me. Can I go get them for you later?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I\u2019m only doing a small business. I don\u2019t sell stuff on credit.\u201d Said the shopkeeper.\u201cBut you know who I am and you are supposed to know where I live. Are you worried that I would not pay for it?\u201dJudging from the shopkeeper\u2019s smiling face, he should be an easy-going person. But no money, no medicine!Rong Yi then stepped out of the pharmacy in a bad mood. If he went home and got the money now, he would probably run into the husband of the original owner of this body. Thinking of this, he could literally feel the pain in the ass.No! There was no way he could go back!He didn\u2019t believe he couldn\u2019t make enough to buy some medicine as the third son of Rong Family!He strolled around and saw a big shop. He decided to give it a go there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It covered the most varieties of goods and also had the biggest auction house in the city. Haishan City was located under the mount foot of Nine Void Sect, the biggest cultivation sect in the state of Zhonghai Prefecture. It was also the biggest city within 2,000 kilometers radius around. That\u2019s what makes it in an endless stream where cultivators come and go.Rong Yi had to squeeze through the crowds while protecting his belly at the same time and finally made it upstairs.The goods on every floor were different. The higher floors, the more expensive the goods were. The higher the floor was, the less cultivators who could afford things there.Rong Yi came straight up to the fourth floor which was also the top floor where rare herbs, ingredients, high-grade elixirs and spiritual runes were sold.He planned to make a fortune on someone rich so that he wouldn\u2019t be worried about his living situation anymore.On the fourth floor, a lot of decent-looking cultivators were slowly and carefully selecting the ingredients they needed, while some guardian-like cultivators were guarding beside the stairs.Rong Yi panted heavily as he supported his big belly with his hands, leaning on the stairs. \u201cWhat the heck! This belly should weigh at least 10 kilos. It nearly kills me!\u201dThe guardians beside gave him a look.He finally caught his breath and had a moment to observe everyone in the room while he was tidying up. Those people were bought things here looked either super rich and super arrogant or as cocky as a cock. None of them looked accommodating. It was impossible to make bit money out of them.After walking around those cultivators, a tall man in black attracted his attention. Although he couldn\u2019t see his face as that man backed to him, he was attracted by his tall, imposing and elegant figure, not to mention his knee-length black hair and long and good-looking fingers.According to Rong Yi\u2019s experience, that man must be very generous to real talents as long as he was satisfied with what he got.Rong Yi walked toward him and saw the items in his hand. It was a purple ulu knife which was hollow in the middle and had sharp cutters on the outer edge.The shopkeeper introduced to the man, \u201cSharp eyes! This magic weapon is made from pure seven-grade ingredients by a level 7 magic weapon forger. It is incredibly sharp and aggressive, and it can break all sorts of defensive formations. Thanks to its seven-grade fire, it can melt any magic weapon or evil beast lower than seven-grade.\u201d\u201cSeven-grade?\u201d the man was apparently not satisfied with a seven-grade weapon, judging from his deep and a little bit hoarse tone.Rong Yi was glad to hear it because it was his chance. He walked forward and said to the man, \u201cit is actually a great weapon. But if you could enchant it, it can be as powerful as a grade eight or nine magic weapon.\u201dIn the modern world, he was a top enchanter. In order to strengthen his own magic weapons, he had put a lot of time on learning the enchanting skills that the ancestors left him and finally created his own unique enchanting skills.But now he was not powerful enough to enchant superior weapons to him. But he could share the method and the man could have an enchanter refine it.\u201cEnchanting?\u201d The man turned around as it aroused his interest, \u201cwhat is that?\u201dHow come? He didn\u2019t even know what enchantment is? Or is there no such enchanting skills in this world? That\u2019d be super awkward!When Rong Yi saw the man\u2019s face, his eyes were wide open.

He wore a black onyx headpiece on his forehead, bringing out his noble and decent quality.Wasn\u2019t it the gorgeous man from ancient times he saw from his second elder brother\u2019s phone?Rong Yi was blank in a shock. How is it possible the man from the picture appear here? Does it mean his having transmigrating in here has something to do with this person? \u00a0Is it possible he could get out of this world through this man?By the way, he had never seen such a good-looking man before. He was not as girly as his second elder brother or the original owner of this body, nor too masculine or tough like any other men. He was more like a handsome man you could see in a traditional Chinese novel, with that kind of magnificent temperament. Even Rong Yi couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off him.\u201cYou know me?\u201d asked Yin Jinye as he was looking at the young man who was even prettier than a girl before him who he was pretty sure he had never seen before. Finally his eyes lay on his swollen belly.That low but nice voice made him walking on clouds. In women\u2019s words, with that voice alone, one could already get pregnant (an idiom in Chinese, an exaggerating way).The shopkeeper who was standing at the counter coughed to hint these two men: one is staring at a swollen belly while the other was preoccupied with the other party\u2019s face.Then Rong Yi came to his sense and said in haste, \u201cSorry, I took you for somebody else.\u201dFuch! It never occurred to him that he would stare at a man without even blinking like his second elder brother.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dBut it didn\u2019t look like he mistook him at all.As Yin Jinye still stared at his belly, he held his belly and smiled awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s just middle-aged spread coming ahead.\u201dYin Jinye couldn\u2019t help but smile gently at his explanation. He then raised his eyes and looked at him, \u201cwhat is enchanting?\u201dTo win Yin Jinye\u2019s credit and stick with him and stay with him to find the way back, Rong Yi had to explain, \u201cEnchanting is a magic skill that is to improve the magic weapon\u2019s attacking or defending power through attaching something on the surface of the magic weapon or inscribe runes on its surface. With the enchanting, the magic weapon would enhance by one or two levels or could possess one or a few more magical skills.\u201dThe shopkeeper looked at Rong Yi as if he was looking at a fool. Why on surface of the magic weapon? Isn\u2019t it simple to add it to the magic weapon when it was forged? And since the magic weapon was forged, would it weaken its power if inscribing something on it? Besides, the high grade the magic weapon was, the harder it was, which means it\u2019d be very difficult to inscribe something on it, unless by using a higher grade magic weapon to carve it. But in that way, it was already very lucky not to degrade, let alone one or two grades higher?If it was really so easy as this young man said, many people would have already tried and succeeded by now. This young man was being ridiculous.However, the shopkeeper couldn\u2019t judge him because he still wanted to do business. It didn\u2019t matter to him if the magic weapon was broken or not after it was sold.\u201cPeople tried before, but failed.\u201d Yin Jinye had the same thought as the shopkeeper.He himself also tried a lot before but all failed.\u201cThat\u2019s becauseyou used the wrong method.\u201d Said Rong Yi with a confident smile.Wrong method? Yin Jinye looked at his pure and bright eyes like he wasn\u2019t bragging. He looked like he really knew how to enhance magic weapons.Then Rong Yi introduced himself to cotton up, \u201cMy name is Rong Yi. And you?\u201d\u201cRong Yi?\u201d Yin Jinye glimpsed at his swollen belly again and then said flatly, \u201cYin Jinye.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I want to make friends with you. I live at\u2026live at\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was kind of upset. He had no place to go. Even if he went back to the house where the original owner of this body lived, he didn\u2019t know the exact address. But it was a little impolite to ask where Yin Jinye lived.Yin Jinye kind of guessed that he forgot where he lived, so he said to him meaningfully, \u201cYin Mansion, Tonggu Street.\u201dRong Yi was surprised, and then forced a smile, \u201cOK then. I will drop by and teach you the enchanting skill when I have time.\u201dYin Jinye nodded and left after he ordered his guardian to pay.Rong Yi then looked around, trying to search another cultivator who might be a chance he could make money out of. But on second thought, he couldn\u2019t lose the trace of Yin Jinye. He was the only clue he could transmigrate back. Although that guy gave him his address, what if it is a fake one?Thinking of this, he went downstairs holding his big belly and stalked Yin Jinye and his guards carefully. Too bad that his spiritual power was too weak and he had no auxiliaries to cover his trace. Soon Xinghe, Yin Jinye\u2019s guard, scouted him tagging along, \u201cmaster, that young man is stalking us.\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t say a word.Having serving the master for so many years, Xinghe knew he could ignore that man behind if the master didn\u2019t say anything.Rong Yi followed them all the way to Tonggu Street which looked quite familiar to him. It seemed that it was the same street as he left the original owner\u2019s house. When he saw the Yin Mansion, he felt even more familiar. It looked quite like the house where the original master lived.When he left the house, he was in such a hurry and never thought he would come back, so he didn\u2019t have a chance to look at what was written on the plague above the gate.Xinghe knocked on the door and later somebody answered.The moment Rong Yi saw the man who answered the door, he was shocked with his eyes wide open, \u201cWhat the hell?! Isn\u2019t he Rong Huan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Was he the owner of the house, husband of the original owner of this body?He didn\u2019t why, but he felt pleased by his finding. If Yin Jinye was the husband, things would be much easier. If\u2026if i have to to sleep with Yin Jinye at night, I could\u2026well\u2026accept it. Bah! What am I thinking?!Rong Yi rubbed his face and realized something was wrong. If Yin Jinye was the husband, why didn\u2019t he recognize him earlier in the shop? Maybe he was the brother of the original master\u2019s husband?Thinking of the possibility, he was down to the bottom of West Lake. Looking at the closed door, he thought, \u201crather than wasting time woolgathering here, why don\u2019t I go inside and find out the truth myself?\u201dHe then walked up and knocked on the door.It was \u00a0Rong Su who answered the door this time. As soon as he saw Rong Yi, he shouted excitedly, \u201cMy lord, the master is here. He is finally here.\u201dHe said the master is here, not the master is back, Rong Yi\u2019s heart sunk.Rong Su then patted on his forehead as if he suddenly remembered something, \u201cI forget that you don\u2019t know about him yet. In fact\u2026in fact\u2026he is not dead.\u201dAs Rong Yi heard the word \u201cdead\u201d, he frowned, \u201cwhat do you mean? Who is your master?\u201d\u201cHe is our master before we came to serve you, that is to say, your husband survived.\u201d Rong Su immediately in case he might get angry and hurt the baby, \u201cYoung master, we didn\u2019t mean to hide it from you. No one expected that the master would survive from the thunder struck on his doomsday. His mother was so sad that she was crazy-like trying to find a person to conceive the master\u2019s yang sperm. To pay back his mother for saving her life, your mother told her that you are a body of pure yin\u2026\u201dSomeone owning pure yin body was born on a Yin day in a Yin month of a Yin year. He or she was born with super gifts, possessing pure yin power and a bit yang power, which could help foster duo cultivation for both him or her and his or her sexual partner. It was very rare which could be seen every 1,000 years. If anyone was found out to have a body of pure yin, he or she might be caged up by those evil cultivators for cultivation.But usually women had bodies of pure yin. It never occurred to men until Rong Yi.\u201cOur master majored in ghost cultivation which generates heavy yin power, which makes it nearly impossible for him to have a child. But people owning pure yin body was different. They own both yin qi and yang qi. So they wouldn\u2019t be hurt by yin qi generated from ghost cultivation and also has the yang qi in their body to conceive a baby because they have both yin and yang power in one body. As Her Lady had not many sperms, she decided to give them to your mother hoping that she could persuade you to conceive his son\u2019s baby. But\u2026\u201d Rong Su made a pause and continued, \u201cbut your mother made the decision without asking your permission. She held the wedding of you and our master\u2019s memorial tablet. She secretly nursed your body and put the sperms into your body. When we knew about it, you were already three-month pregnant. And we found the fact that our master was not dead two years ago. He was seriously injured from the thunder struck. He had to cultivate in seclusion to heal himself. We didn\u2019t tell you because we didn\u2019t want you to get worried. Now that our master is healed and comes back, Her Old Lady sent him to find you. Young master, our master is way better-looking and more powerful than your big senior brother apprentice. You would fall in love with our master and get over your senior brother apprentice when you see him.\u201dRong Su\u2019s face was shining on mentioning his master.Rong Yi patted Rong Su on the shoulder, \u201cgood boy. You impressed me.\u201dHe only asked one question and this fellow told him every detail already, which saved him a lot of time to collect information now.If it had been Rong Huan, he wouldn\u2019t even say a word.\u201cWhere is your master now?\u201d\u201cIn t Biluo Yard.\u201d On seeing that he was not pissed off, Rong Su felt much relieved. Watching Rong Yi walk into the backyard, Rong Su suddenly remembered one thing and then shouted, \u201cYoung master, the little master has come back.\u201dBut Rong Yi was long gone, so he didn\u2019t hear Rong Su at all.Rong Su didn\u2019t bother to chase after him.

He rubbed his aching heart and sour burning eyes, \u201cDamn it!\u201dSince Rong Su told him that the mother of the original master of this body put sperms into his body without his permission, he felt kind of indescribably miserable and painful in his heart as if he was abandoned. He was so sad that he wanted to cry out. It might be because the original master of this body blamed his mother for getting him pregnant and he could no longer be with his senior brother apprentice.\u201cYoung master.\u201d greeted Rong Huan with respect.Rong Yi came to his sense and then asked, \u201cWhere is your master?\u201d\u201cYou already know that the master is here?\u201d asked Rong Huan surprisingly.\u201cHm.\u201dRong Huan blinked and said, \u201cYoung master, this way please.\u201dHe showed Rong Yi to the inner room on the westernmost yard, \u201che is inside.\u201dThen Rong Huan turned around and left.Rong Yi stopped at the doorway and thought if he was too pushy.Perhaps he should wait until Rong Huan or Rong Su to introduce them. Since he was here blue uninvited, he even didn\u2019t know what to say to Yin Jinye now, or how to introduce himself.But since he was here already, there was no reason to leave.As he was about to knock on the door, he heard sound of water inside.He paused and thought, \u201cWhy is there sound of water? Is he taking a bath? If so, I shouldn\u2019t go in now.\u201dRong Yi involuntarily peeked through the door slot.With one peek, he could hard move his eyes.The man in the room was standing in the steaming water and pouring water onto his dark and wet long black hair. The water was flowing down his pretty face, all the way down his sexy chest to the bathtub. The water in the bathtub barely covered his private part. Luckily his sexy butt was above the water. Every part of him was like seducing the peer to commit a crime.Rong Yi was turned on and couldn\u2019t help but licked his drying lips. He wished that he could pounce at him and directly \u2018eat\u2019 him in the bathtub.Noticing that someone was peeping, Yin Jinye glimpsed at the door, which startled Rong Yi and he immediately looked away.Rong Yi despised himself in his heart bitterly. He was supposed to hate gays but now he was desperate to bang the man in the room? Fuck! It should be the original owner of the body. Otherwise, he had no such a weird feeling for another man.He then sensed that a pair of eyes was staring at him, He turned around and saw an about three-year-old kid smiling at him.The kid looked exactly like the original owner of the body, exquisite and cute. He had a pair of big eyes and cherry lips. If it wasn\u2019t that he was wearing boy\u2019s outfit, one might take him as a girl.Rong Yi frowned, who is this kid?\u201cMom-daddy!\u201d The kid excitedly pounced at Rong Yi and held his leg.Rong Yi was surprised. Is this the son of the original owner of this body? So the original owner of this boy has a son? But what is mom-daddy? It sounds so weird.\u201cWhat are you doing, mom-daddy?\u201d the little kid turned his head and looked through the door.It was already too late when Rong Yi tried to stop him. The kid giggled, \u201cmom-daddy, shame , shame, shame! You are peeping at other\u2019s big penis. Shame, shame, shame\u2026\u201dYin Jinye in the room, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi was ashamed and angry that he was caught of peeping by a kid, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about! Who taught you those dirty words?\u201dThe kid \u00a0knew mom-daddy was pissed off, so he immediately ran away giggling, while shouting, \u201cMom-daddy is peeping at other\u2019s big penis.

Say it again.\u201dThe little kid hopped into his arms, \u201cMom-daddy, I want milk.\u201d\u201cGo away!\u201d Rong Yi gritted his teeth.Next moment the kid already bit his chest through his outfit.\u201cAh!\u201d Rong Yi felt like the flesh on the chest was nearly bitten off. He cried, \u201cYou stupid kid! How dare you!\u201dHe wanted to tear the kid off him with force, but when he saw into the little kid\u2019s big watery innocent eyes, he just can\u2019t.That was why he hated kids so much. Kids were naughty and annoying. But he just couldn\u2019t beat him and have the heart to yell at him as the little kid gave him those big puppy eyes.All of sudden, Rong Yi fainted.Rong Su quickly flew by and took away the kid, \u201clittle master, you have drunk too much blood this time. Your mom-daddy couldn\u2019t take it, neither the baby in his belly.\u201d\u201cBut I am hungry.\u201d Said the kid while looking at Rong Su innocently.\u201cYou can\u2019t overdrink it, otherwise you will kill your mom-daddy. Bear with it. I will take you to eat something yummy later.\u201d Rong Su rubbed his little head and then turned to Rong Yi, \u201cyoung master, are you alright?\u201dRong Yi slipped down the pillar and sat on a stone chair beside feebly, feeling quite dizzy.Rong Su took a bowel of sugar water and a bottle of medicine from his Storage Ring, \u201cyoung master, drink some sugar water. It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201dRong Yi felt a little refreshed after taking the sugar water. He brushed open his clothes and found two tooth bites on the right tit with blood on it. So the kid was basically sucking blood out of him? \u201cWhat the fuck! Why did that kid suck my blood?\u201dIs the kid a vampire? And he has sharp tooth. He even gnawed through a few layers of cloth!\u201cBut why did he have to suck blood from my chest?\u201dRong Su blinked, \u201cYoung master, didn\u2019t you tell him to do so?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s lips were twitched. So the original master of the body really \u00a0took himself as a woman.Compared with the original master of the body, he suddenly felt his second elder brother was not that sissy.\u201cYoung master, his lord said he still doesn\u2019t know you, so he sent me to invite you to his yard and meet you officially.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn hearing that Yi Jinye asked to see them, Rong Yi, who already wanted to see him too, immediately went back to his room, applied the medicine, changed a clean robe and went to Biluo Yard with the well-fed kid.The moment he stepped into the yard, he saw that Yin Jinye was lying on a luxurious bed.Rong Yi was stunned since he was the exactly same as the photo on his second elder brother\u2019s mobile phone, same posture, same clothes at exactly same angles.\u201cAren\u2019t you the cultivator we ran into at the Ten Fortunes Shop? Are you here to\u2026\u201d Xinghe was surprised to see Rong Yi.But as he saw Rong Yi\u2019s belly, he immediately switched the topic, \u201cYou are Lord Rong, aren\u2019t you?\u201dRong Yi nodded and noticed that Yin Jinye was wearing no expression at all. He assumed that Yin Jinye already figured out who he was from his name, belly and look. So he would stay so calm.While Xinghe sized Rong Yi up and down.Rong Huan then introduced them to Yin Jinye, \u201cMy lord, this is your partner Lord \u00a0Rong and your son Yin Tao.\u201dHe squatted down and said to the little kid, \u201cLittle master, don\u2019t you always want to meet your father? He is your father. Call father.\u201dSince Yin Tao could talk, they kept mentioning Yin Jinye in front of him. So the kid was looking forward to meet Yin Jinye someday. Although he was only 3 years old, he could sense that his father was bit indifferent. So he involuntarily leaned to Rong Yi\u2019s side.Rong Yi then rubbed his little head.Yin Jinye didn\u2019t care if the kid called him father or not. He just asked flatly, \u201cis he that premature kid?\u201d\u201cYes. Something happened at the time, so Yin Tao was born early and the other baby almost died. Luckily Her Ladyship was there and saved both of them. The other boy is still in Master Rong\u2019s belly. The baby needs his yang qi to recover and Yin Tao still needs his blood to nourish.\u201d Answered Rong Huan.Rong Yi subconsciously touched his belly on hearing him. So the baby in his belly was this little kid\u2019s twin brother.Now Yin Jinye lay his eyes on Rong Yi, \u201cRong Yi\u2026\u201dRong Yi answered.Yin Jinye curled up his liped and asked, \u201cCan you tell me where you live now?\u201d\u201cYin Mansion, Tonggu Street.\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s eyes were twitched.Yin Jinye noticed Rong Yi\u2019s pale face and signaled Xinghe to give them the presents he prepared and then let them go back for rest.Rong Yi was not anxious anymore since he already confirmed that Yin Jinye was the partner of the original master. He had a lot of time to find a way to go back through Jin Yinye. Besides, he could tell Yin Jinye didn\u2019t want to carry on the conversation, so he just left with Rong Su.Xinghe moved to Rong Huan\u2019s side and said, \u201cHe is nothing like you said. He is neither sissy or cowardly.\u201dRong Huan, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi was indeed different from usual today. He neither spoke softly or tenderly like a girl nor wore makeups before he went out this time. He even asked the doctor to reshape his gross small feet. If it had been before, when he saw the master, he would have already cried like a woman and begged the master to abort the baby or something like that. Besides, his temperament had also changed. He became much masculine today.After returning to his room, Rong Yi sat on the bed, confused. If he aborted the baby now, it was quite possible he would be kicked out of the house. That was not what worried him. The thing was, without the baby, Yin Jinye might never talk to him again, or ever hold a grudge against him. And it was nearly impossible for him to go back to his world. But if he kept the baby, it would be killing him for having a baby as a man. It felt like riding the tiger now.Why would all of these bad things happen to him? Why would he have transmigrated into a loser, also a sissy pants? What\u2019s even worse, he had a husband now, and way worse than that, he had two kids, and He had to give birth to one of them.The four things he hated the most, gays, kids, losers and sissy pants, now he occupied all of them.Is it because he lives too comfortable a life so the Heaven would punish him?Forget it!It was no use to think of it. He\u2019d better make himself strong which was the most important thing now.Rong Yi started his plan immediately. He ordered Rong Su not to interrupt him after he had dinner. He pulled up all night to cultivate in his room.He was thrilled that he had thunder fire in his palm. He promoted to level one Qi Training in just one day. Thanks to the original master\u2019s Qi practice on a daily basis, plus the pure yin body and sufficient spiritual power in this world, he made it happen. Otherwise, it would take him at least half a month to do so.If he wanted to promote again in short time, he needed more ingredients. But he didn\u2019t find spiritual stones in the room no matter how hard he tried. Without spiritual stones, he couldn\u2019t buy what he needed.He had to go out and asked Rong Su for help.As soon as he stepped out of the yard, he saw Yin Tao were having a fight with other two kids.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYin Tao grabbed a boy\u2019s collar of his cyan robe and yelled, \u201cMine is awesome! The most powerful!\u201d\u201cYour magic weapon is powerless and ugly. You can defeat us.\u201d The two boys were about five years old, half a head taller than Yin Tao but not as strong as him.Rong Huan didn\u2019t step in since he didn\u2019t think the two boys could not defeat their little master. While the other two boys\u2019 servants thought their little masters would definitely bully a kid younger together, so they also didn\u2019t stop them, just stood by and watch.Rong Yi moved to Rong Huan and asked, \u201cWhat are they fighting for?\u201d\u201cYesterday, Yin Tao spent four hours refining a magic weapon, which was an assignment from school. It took the little master four hours to refine it. Early this morning, the little master\u2019s two senior brothers brought the magic weapons from others to compete with him and said the little master\u2019s magic weapon is ugly and lame.\u201d explained Rong Huan.\u201cYin Tao accused my little master of cheating with other\u2019s magic weapon. Shame on you!\u201d argued one servant of Yin Tao\u2019s senior brother.Rong Huan then scanned Yin Tao\u2019s two senior brother\u2019s level 1 magic weapon, with a dash of distain in his eyes. Shame on them! Anyone could tell that the boys\u2019 weapons were refined by grown-ups because no kids could make such well-shaped weapons.While Yin Tao already mastered the skills to refine magic weapons, a genius among smart kids though, as he was still a kid, he couldn\u2019t make a refined weapon as a grown-up did, not to mention a powerful and high level one.The other servant said, \u201cit\u2019s a waste of time to argue with them. It is up to little master\u2019s teacher to decide whose is better or whether they cheat or not.\u201d\u201cYou are right. Let\u2019s go and ask for the teacher\u2019s decision.\u201dThe servants then left with their little masters. Before the boys left, they stepped on Yin Tao\u2019s magic weapon.\u201cSon of bitch!\u201d Yin Tao shouted at them while he was picking it up carefully.Rong Yi frowned, where did he learn those swear words?\u201cBitch!\u201dRong Yi couldn\u2019t hold longer. He scolded him like he did to his own younger brothers, \u201cwho taught you to say those dirty words?\u201dAlthough he used bad languages quite often, he didn\u2019t use swear words like that.It was the first time that Yin Tao was scolded by his mom-daddy. He already felt wronged and now tears immediately popped out of his eyesThe servants in the yard all felt sorry for him and stared at Rong Yi angrily.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Did he teach the kid a wrong lesson?Rong Yi felt sorry for Yin Tao seeing that Yin Tao tried to hold his tears and didn\u2019t cry out. While he was considering if he needed to comfort him, an angry voice roared, \u201cwhat the fuck! Who the hell is bullying my pupil? I am fucking killing him!\u201dA man dashed in front of Yin Tao and cuddled the kid while staring at Rong Yi angrily, \u201cSon of bitch. It\u2019s you again! Pussy! Every time you got bullies outside, you would vent your anger on a kid. Are you even a man? You should have already got yourself castrated and be an eunuch!\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dNow he finally knew where the kid learned those swear words from.Lei Sai clumsily wiped Yin Tao\u2019s tears, \u201cit\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t cry. After this pussy gives birth to your brother, I will cut his penis off and feed it to a dog.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Rong Yi wanted to argue back but stopped as he saw Yin Tao stopped sobbing but laughed.\u201cYou smiled.\u201d Lei Sai laughed and carried Yin Tao into the hall, \u201clet\u2019s go have breakfast.\u201dSeeing them leave happily, Rong Yi frowned, like he was an outsider.\u201cHe is still young. You should comfort her first and talk through it.\u201d Rong Huan also walked into the hall after he said so.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.His second elder brother and his butler used to talk the same thing to him too. Kids were kids He should talk senses to them slowly.Rong Yi then also insensibly followed them to the hall.Yin Tao moved closer to Lei Sai as he saw Rong Yi.Rong Huan already told Lei Sai about what had happened earlier. Lei Sai snorted at Rong Yi and then checked the magic weapon Yin Tao refined.Rong Yi felt kind of disappointed since Yin Tao was not close to him. He had the same feeling when his siblings were closer to his two elder brothers. They were family. He couldn\u2019t understand why the quintuplets didn\u2019t like him. They only shot toy guns at him, but they never did it to Rong Qi.Lei Sai put down the magic weapon and said, \u201cYour magic weapon is far from level one weapon. It is not possible to defeat level one magic weapon for sure.\u201d\u201cMaybe we can buy a level one weapon for the little master and he could bring it to school to beat them.\u201d Rong Su suggested.Both Rong Huan and Lei Sai gave him a hard stare.\u201cAre you telling Yin Tao that he can cheat like those two boys?\u201d asked Rong Huan.\u201cIt is not a victory even if he wins with a bought one. He will be laughed at. No one would believe he could be actually a great magic weapon forger in the future.\u201d Said Lei Sai.\u201cSo we do nothing but watch him lose to others?\u201dLei Sai, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Huan, \u201c\u2026\u201dOf course they didn\u2019t want Yin Tao to lose.Yin Tao kept silent as he was watching his own magic weapon, trying to put wrinkles in his brow.Rong Yi also frowned. He also felt uncomfortable when he saw the kid was not happy. But he didn\u2019t know how to cheer him up. What would his second elder brother do in such a situation?Thinking of the way his second brother dealt with the quintuplets, he asked, \u201cCan I have a look at your magic weapon?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone was staring at Rong Yi surprisingly.When Yin Tao started to learned refining magic weapons, he tried to show him proudly. However, Song Yi was not impressed at all. He did not even look at it, which made Yin Tao very upset. It was the first time that Rong Yi was interested in the magic weapon Yin Tao refined, and also the first time that he showed intimacy to his own son.Yin Tao\u2019s eyes were shining and he looked at Rong Yi expectantly. Even though Rong Yi had been very cold to him before, sometimes he got angry with him, he was still his dad. He sincerely hoped that his family could be close to him.Rong Yi picked up the magic weapon and asked, \u201cHave you named it?\u201dYin Tao shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201dThe magic weapon looked like a sword, but the blades were not neatly-cut, and the hilt was shaped like a chicken claw. If you didn\u2019t take a closer look, you wouldn\u2019t know what it was.Rong yi then stroked the uneven surface and said, \u201cThis is a sword, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYin Tao nodded and approached Rong Yi, \u201cmom-daddy, am I awesome?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Rong Yi rubbed his hair slightly and thought to himself, \u201cyou are even more awesome if you don\u2019t call me mom-daddy.\u201dYin Tao giggled happily since this was the first time his mom-daddy praised him.Lei Sai was not happy that he, as a master Shifu, was always not as important as a father. No matter how much he praised his pupil, his pupil wouldn\u2019t be as happy as sentence praising word he got from his father.Rong Huan and Rong Su both smiled on seeing that Rong Yi and Yin Tao finally bonded closer.\u201cYour sword is like a small snake swimming in the water. There are several curves. Since it is not straight enough, we can name it Curved Sword.\u201d\u201cCurved Sword sounds good, I like it.\u201d Yin Tao nodded excitedly.Rong Yi smiled that his son got closer to him. He began to study the magic weapon carefully, \u201cthis one is made of iron steel. If it was made of aluminum steel instead, you can make a better one. Iron steel is too hard for children to completely forge.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you know!? Just because iron steel is hard, it is strong enough to resist other magic weapons. Aluminum steel is fragile against other weapons.\u201dRong Yi took a glimpse of him and said, \u201cIf you cannot completely melt it, every effort you make is in vain. Aluminum steel is soft but easy for children to melt and refine. By attaching to the surface of other materials, such as scales of Tiger Snake body which are much harder than iron steel, it also works better.\u201d\u201cTiger Snake scales are harder to melt and refine than steel, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cWho said to refine it? I mean attaching it to magic weapons.\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes at him.\u201cWhat the fuck! How the hell would you attach it? You mean after the magic weapon is refined? It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Lei Sai thought it was nonsense, but he agreed what Rong Yi said about \u201cif you cannot completely melt it, every effort you make is in vain.\u201d When Yin Tao made the sword, he once hesitated whether to suggest him to quit using iron steel.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later.\u201d Rong Yi felt the surface of the sword, \u201cnow the most important thing is to improve the level of Curved Sword.\u201dSeeing Lei Sai\u2019s outrageous face like he was gonna hit someone, Rong Su said quickly, \u201cyoung master, only by reforging it can we improve its level. But it\u2019s too late. Yin Tao will hand in the assignment very soon.\u201dHe winked Rong Yi while he spoke, indicating him not to make irresponsible remarks, otherwise Lei Sai might really beat him.Rong Yi glanced at them, pressed his hand against the sword near the hilt, and then launched purple glow in his palm like fire and lightning.Rong Su was surprised to look at Rong Yi\u2019s hand, \u201cyoung master, you have spiritual power?\u201dAlthough they all know that the person who owned the body of pure Yin was far from a loser who could not cultivate at all, they had ever secretly checked Rong Yi\u2019s body who had no spiritual root at all, meaning that he had no chance to cultivate. But now he had lightning-like thing in his palm which was really hard to explain.Rong Yi did not answer them, but focused all his attention on the magic weapon. After all, he was only at level one of Qi Practicing. It was rather difficult for him to enchant the magic weapon. The lucky thing was that Yin Tao\u2019s sword was level-less at all.His hand moved slowly along the point of the sword, and goldish red runes flickered all the way where his hand touched, which made the ugly sword look much more delicate, adding a sense of mystery to it and augmenting its spiritual power.Rong Yi retrieved his spiritual power from the sword tip and looked at the fine attacking runes on the sword satisfactorily. He did the same on the other side of the blade and hilt with defending runes and consolidation runes, and then put the sword in Yan Tao hand, \u201cI\u2019ve just enchanted the sword to augment its attacking, defending and toughness. See if you like it.\u201dBefore Yin Tao could take it, Lei Sai grabbed it and checked.As Rong Su and Rong Huan also noticed that the sword had become different from the original one, they also moved curiously next to Lei Sai.Lei Sai felt the runes on the sword. The disdain and anger on his face now quickly turned into unbelieving, he then said, \u201cyou fucking son of bitch, how come\u2026 How could you\u2026 \u201dRong Su was so anxious to ask, \u201cBrother Lei, how is the little master\u2019s sword now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLei Sai exclaimed excitedly, \u201cAlthough its level is the same, its attacking and defending power and toughness are all two times higher, even better than a level one magic weapon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more powerful?!\u201d both Rong Su and Rong Huan were amazed.It was amazing that Rong Yi made it even more powerful than level one weapon only by applying runes they never met to the sword.\u201cHow did you inscribe the runes onto the weapon?\u201d asked Lei Sai.He tried so many tools to inscribe runes onto the magic weapons but all failed. He either couldn\u2019t apply runes onto weapons or just broke the weapons, or reduced the power of magic weapons so that he had to affix paper runes onto the magic weapons to increase the power. But paper runes were not ideal choices because they could be melted by water or burnt by fire, and became invalid. They could be only used once. No one could have a chance to affix paper runes during a fight. Besides, once they were affixed to magic weapons, they were easily to be recognized by the enemies. Affixing paper runes was not a good choice in many ways.\u201cYou want to know?\u201d Rong Yi smiled at Lei Sai.More than wanting to know about it, Lei Sai was desperate to master the skill right now.\u201cBeg me.\u201d Rong Yi snorted while he took the magic weapon away from Lei Sai and gave it back to Yin Tao.Lei Sai just said he was a sassy bitch, claimed to cut off his cock and sent him to a brothel. How could he teach someone who was rude to him?\u201cAre\u2026are you fucking kidding me?\u201d Lei Sai was so pissed off.Rong Yi didn\u2019t give it a shit if Lei Sai was mad or not. He just lowered his head and said to Yin Tao, \u201cI assure you that you can win your little senior brothers with this sword.\u201d Said Rong Yi to Yin Tao.He saw the two kids\u2019 magic weapons which were just level-one powerful. They were ordinary ones that their parents bought for them to as their assignment.Seeing the rune on the sword dim out, Yin Tao was anxious, \u201cMom-daddy, it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone!\u201dRong Yi rubbed his forehead slightly and comforted him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. When you use the sword, it will show again.\u201dYin Tao then smiled happily.\u201cAre you happy?\u201d asked Rong Yi,\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Nodded Yin Tao hard.Rong Yi then asked, \u201cDo you want to enchant your magic weapon and make it more powerful in the future?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201dRong Yi then said with a serious tone, \u201cThen you will never say swear words, such as cock, penis, bitch, son of bitch, slut, whore, fuck and anything like that. You promise?\u201dActually he himself also said some nasty words but not as vulgar as Lei Sai.Yin Tao then nodded.Lei Sai then thundered, \u201cWhat the fuck! What\u2019s wrong with swear words? Does it bother you? A real man should say swear words.\u201d\u201cAgreed. If you are a man, you should say swear words in front of his lordship.\u201d Said Rong Huan.Lei Sai, \u201c\u2026\u201dTheir lord loathed swear words, especially spoken by his fellow men. If Lei Sai hadn\u2019t been the favored one, he might have been chopped into pieces and be fed to the evil beasts.It was also the reason why Lei Sai, an eight-level Spiritual Weapon Forger was sent here to teach a three-year-old boy to refine weapons.To Lei Sai, it was difference from being exiled.Yin Tao couldn\u2019t wait to show off his magic weapon, so he shouted excitedly while pulling Rong Huan\u2019s hand, \u201cI am going to school right now. I am going to school right now.\u201dIt was the first time that Yin Tao was so happy to go to school since he got enrolled.\u201cAfter breakfast.\u201d Rong Huan put down a bowl of meat porridge in front of him.Rong Yi looked around the hall but didn\u2019t see any trace of Yin Jinye, so he asked, \u201cWhere is your lord? Does he eat breakfast or not?\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t have dinner with them either last night.\u201cHe is fasting. He doesn\u2019t eat on time like mortals do.\u201d Said Rong Huan.Rong Yi frowned.Yin Jinye and he neither slept on the same bed nor shared the same room. So they had no chance to see each other. He thought he could bond with him at dinner table but Yin Jinye was on a fast. In this case, they would stay as strangers forever.No! He couldn\u2019t just wait! He had to do something to change the situation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYin Tao finished his porridge very quickly and then dragged Rong Huan out of the room excitedly.As Lei Sai wanted to witness the power of the sword, he left with them too.Haishan Academy where Yin Tao went school was founded by Master Taixu, the master of Nine Void Sect, the No. 1 cultivation sect which mainly enrolled children under 10 years old to study cultivation skills and the top students among them were selected to join the Nine Void Sect. Cultivators of Nine Void Sect usually were invited to teach the children at the Academy.Therefore, thousands of children flocked into the Academy to study cultivation skills and some even bribed cultivators to save a spot for them, hoping they could be selected by Nine Void Sect. Even if they couldn\u2019t be selected eventually, they could make fast progress under the coach of cultivators of the Sect.After Yin Tao rushed to the Academy and handed in his sword to the eldest apprentice of his master Shifu Jin Tong, Rong Huan and Lei Sai waited outside the room.In Haishan Academy, students under the age of five were allowed to bring companies to school. But they would only wait outside.When Jin Tong received Yin Tao\u2019s magic weapon, there was a dash of mocking flashing in his eyes. His master Shifu always praised Yin Tao for his great talent and potentials. But the sword Yin Tao made had no level at all and its shape was terribly disgusting, like a piece of shit.Jealousy made him forget that Yin Tao was only a three-year-old child, and it was already not easy for a kid to make a magic weapon. Any other three-year-old children just started to learn cultivation.\u201cUnqualified.\u201d Jin Tong handed it back to Yin Tao and said, \u201cGo back and make another qualified level one magic weapon.\u201dYin Tao looked up at him and said, \u201cBut master Shifu said I don\u2019t need to make one with level as long as I try my best.\u201dJin Tong was outraged when he mentioned their master Shifu and shouted loudly, \u201cMaster Shifu asked me to check your assignments, meaning that you have to listen to me. If I affirm your magic weapon is not qualified, it is not qualified. If you don\u2019t do what I say, you are expelled from school and never will be recruited.\u201dSince Yin Tao was admitted to the school, master Shifu always praised him for his talent and taught him how to make magic weapons in person. This never occurred to Jin Tong before. Yin Tao was a fast learner. He could master anything his master Shifu taught, which made him one of master Shifu\u2019s favorites.What was really hurtful was that his master Shifu said that he was not even comparable with a child and he could have become famous if he was half smart and talented as Yin Tao. He was both jealous and mad at Yin Tao.Whenever his master Shifu bragged in front of people, he always mentioned Yin Tao, not Jin Tong at all.In fact, Taoist Yunyi, Yin Tao\u2019s master Shifu, favored Yin Tao for a reason.Taoist Yunyi was a magic weapon freak. He spent his life time refining magic weapons. And he was well known in the industry. He also made many supreme spiritual weapons. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have much time left. If he couldn\u2019t make any breakthrough, he only could live for about another hundred years. To stop his skills going away with his death, he spent ages looking for someone who could inherit his skills.Finally he found a child with incredible talent. He was like a rare treasure for him. He would like to teach Yin Tao all the knowledge he knew. Unfortunately, Yin Tao was too young to stay away from his parents. Otherwise, he would have already taken him to the Sect to teach him exclusively.Lei Sai was about to hurl abuse at Jin Tong who obviously was picking on his pupil. But Rong Huan stopped him.\u201cWe know our little master\u2019s sword has no level but is as powerful as a level-one magic weapon.\u201d Said Rong Huan.\u201cYou are fooling yourself. Show a real magic weapon.\u201d One of the two servants of the two kids who bullied Yin Tao before laughed.\u201cSince you think yours is more powerful than ours, I challenge you.\u201d Said the other servant.\u201cI challenge you too. You will have a taste of our magic weapon and kneel to beg for our mercy.\u201d The other servant dittoed.They picked on Yin Tao only because he was popular with the master Shifu so that their young masters were neglected completely.\u201cFine. Challenge accepted.\u201d Lei Sai smirked.Rong Huan, \u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough Lei Sai checked the magic weapon, actually he and Lei Sai were not confident because they never tried it before and were not sure if it was really better than a level one magic weapon after having been enchanted.As Jing Tong saw that everyone wanted to embarrass Yin Tao, he curled up his lips and agreed.Yin Tao and other kids all took their magic weapons back and activated them.It was pity that they were just children under the age of five. They were only at the entry level of Qi Practicing. They didn\u2019t have much spiritual power. It was good enough if they could fly their magic weapons, not to mention fight with them.While they flew the magic weapons, they were already sweaty all over and the magic weapons were also wagging in the air.The case was different for Yin Tao. Since he made the sword himself, it meant he could control it. The Curved Sword flew smoothly in the air and dodged any incoming attacks.\u201cTao, aim for their magic weapons.\u201d laughed Lei Sai wildly.\u201cGet it.\u201d Yin Tao giggled as he launched the Curved Sword on which goldish red runes showed up and, bam, a magic weapon exploded and fell on the floor.Jin Tong couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He checked Yin Tao\u2019s magic weapon and was sure it had no level at all. How was it possible it could defeat a level one weapon?The level-one weapon must be defective, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t explode because of a non-level weapon. It made sense because it was just an assignment for kids who might not hand in their best ones.But it was a joke. It was impossible that a level-one magic weapon was less powerful than no-level one.Other servants were all shocked since Yin Tao had destroyed the magic weapons of their little masters one by one.Rong Huan was no less shocked. Although he knew that the Curved Sword was enchanted, he didn\u2019t expect it could defeat all the others. He was surprised unlike he barely was.\u201cWhat the fuck! I might need to beg the sissy pants to teach me.\u201d Lei Sai was both excited and depressed.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d A reproaching sound roared suddenly.The kids were all startled by their master Shifu\u2019s shout and their spiritual power instantly melted away. Their magic weapons losing the spiritual power also fell down from the air. As an old man in white approached, they lined up and saluted, \u201cMaster Shifu.\u201dJin Tong was panicked and worried that Taoist Yunyi would blame him for not regulating those kids well. \u201cMaster Shifu, you said that you wouldn\u2019t come today. What brings you here?\u201d asked he.\u201cI still have some time after things are done. So I come.\u201d Said Taoist Yunyi.In fact, he squeezed some time especially to see Yin Tao\u2019s magic weapon.Yin Tao ran to the old man with his Curved Sword, \u201cMaster Shifu, take a look at my sword. It defeated all their level-one weapons.\u201d Seeing his innocent and pretty little face, the serious expression instantly turned to a tender one, and Taoist Yunyi petted him softly, \u201cyou have made a magic weapon? Show me.\u201dWhen he looked at the rune on the Curved Sword flying in the air, he was surprised, \u201cis this\u2026\u201dHe grabbed the sword quickly and checked it. The sword had no level but was as powerful as level-one weapons because of the rune on it. The rune was neither engraved nor carved.He tried to carve runes into the magic weapons while he was refining magic weapons but it turned out to be a failure. Runes and magic weapons were not compatible. It was hard to make them effective together. He finally made a roughly complete one after thousands of tries.\u201cLittle Cherry, tell me how you inscribe the rune to the sword.\u201d Asked Taoist Yunyi.\u201cIt was my mom-daddy.\u201d Answered Yin Tao excitedly.Rong Yi, who was still having breakfast at Yin Mansion, suddenly sneezed, \u201cAchoo!\u201dRong Su, who was serving aside, asked, \u201cYoung master, are you feeling uncomfortable? Do I need to get a physician for you?\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t know that he already draw attention to others for the enchanting thing. He ate up the last bite of the steamed stuffed bun and said while rubbing his nose, \u201cI am not sick. Your lord must be missing me. Let\u2019s go to find him and go shopping.\u201d\u201cBut he ordered us not to disturb him.\u201d\u201cHe will see me.\u201d Rong Yi stood up while holding his bumping belly with his hand.Rong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To his knowledge, all ghost cultivators had to get rid of their original bodies before their spirits were cultivated into shapes. Before they got through the doomed catastrophe and became immortals, they looked exactly the same as common people. But in fact they owned incomplete seven affections and six desires. They couldn\u2019t feel the affections between family members or friends or lovers.So Yin Jinye was not easy to handle because if he pushed him too hard, Yin Jinye might kick him out regardless of who he was or whether he was pregnant. But if he didn\u2019t get close enough to him, he would be ignored by him forever.Without being invited in as Rong Yi stood at the doorway nearly over 10 minutes, Rong Yi knocked on the door, \u201cYin Jinye, I am coming inside.\u201dYin Jinye gave him a look but didn\u2019t say a word.Rong Yi took it as a yes. He walked in and sat next to him. The ancient seal characters on his book were obscure for Rong Yi to read. Exchanging views of the book was obviously not a good ice-breaker.Then he looked back and laid his eyes on his bumping belly and an idea popped out of his mind. He shouted, \u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cYoung master, are you having another stomachache? Do I need to get a physician for you?\u201d Rong Su got nervous.\u201cMy ass hurts.\u201d said Rong Yi grumpily.The baby\u2019s father hasn\u2019t said something while you a servant got nervous? Do you have any idea at all that I am faking stomachache to draw Yin Jinye\u2019s attention?Rong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dYin Jinye loathed coarse language. So he frowned at Rong Yi.\u201cYour son is kicking me.\u201d Said Rong Yi, giving him those puppy eyes while grabbing Yin\u2019s hand to feel his belly.Dear lord!He used to be respected as the third master of Rong family. But now he could go so low to draw a man\u2019s attention with pregnancy. Was it a punishment he deserved because he hated gays?Yin Jinye looked up at him with that pair of dark eyes.\u201cHe is moving. Feel it. You feel it. He must be happy to know that his father is here.\u201d Rong Yi tried to convince him.He led Yin\u2019s hand to feel all over his big swollen belly. Yin\u2019s hand was cold. His porcelain skin was even more beautiful than women.Rong Yi couldn\u2019t help but squeezed his hand. It was more comfortable to feel than he imagined that he couldn\u2019t let it go. He had no idea that he was like a pervert in Yin Jinye and Rong Su\u2019s eyes.Bam! Yin Jinye patted on his hand with the book in his hand.Rong Yi grinned in embarrassment but didn\u2019t plan to get his hand back. All of sudden, the baby kicked inside.\u201cHe is moving! He is moving! See? He is moving!\u201d He was thrilled.Yin Jinye\u2019s hand was placed right above where the baby kicked. His thumb moved around the area tenderly.\u201cYin Jinye, can you feel our son is kicking me?\u201d after Rong Yi said, he was shocked that how fast he got used to his role within one day. And he was holding a man\u2019s hand and even enjoying it. What the hell?He pulled Yin Jinye out of the seat and said, \u201cIt\u2019s sunny and comfortable outside for you to take a stroll with me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, it was weird for two men holding hands in public.There was one thing that he was curious. Why would Rong Huan, Rong Su and Lei Sai who practice pure spiritual cultivation work for a ghost cultivator?Theoretically, ghost cultivators should be super evil in their eyes. Normally it only happened when people were so seriously injured that had no choice but to choose ghost cultivation. They usually had weak three souls and seven spirits, or not enough souls or spirits. They had to absorb souls and spirits from others to complete themselves so that they could be powerful enough to cultivate their mortal bodies. That was why the spiritual cultivators took ghost ones as evil.Even some of ghost cultivators were kind men before they started ghost cultivation. They would eventually become an evil to spiritual cultivators because they absorb others\u2019 souls. Even if they didn\u2019t absorb souls, they would do harms and damages because of lack of souls or spirits.Ghost cultivation was usually harder than ordinary cultivation because it was harder to get promoted and ghost cultivators got double thunder strike when getting through their doomed catastrophe before promotion. It was rare that ghost cultivators could succeed in taking thunder strike. Therefore, very few cultivators would like to give up their mortal bodies for ghost cultivation.Rong Yi, looking at Yin Jinye\u2019s back, thought, \u201cYin Jinye must be very powerful, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide his yin qi and no would notice he is a ghost cultivator.\u201d\u201cWhere to?\u201d Yin Jinye stopped to ask him.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Ten Fortunes.\u201d Rong Yi just realized that they had walked out of the house.Yin Jinye then kept walking alone.\u201cSlow down. Wait for me. I can\u2019t walk fast with this big belly.\u201d Shouted Rong Yi while he supported his waist with his arms.Yin Jinye still didn\u2019t look back but slowed down.Rong Yi pursed his lips. He was not as indifferent as he imagined.But he was not quite satisfied with the distance. So he shouted again, \u201cWe are supposed to stay together. But you are way ahead of me. Do we even look like a couple?\u201dYin Jinye then slowed down to wait for him.Rong Yi finally caught up with Yin Jinye and signaled Rong Su to back off, \u201cGo, go, go! You don\u2019t need to be here. Your lord and I want to be alone.\u201d\u201cBut young master, you haven\u2019t put on some makeup.\u201d Said Rong Su in a low voice.Rong Yi gritted his teeth, \u201cIf you ever mention makeup thing like rouge or pearl powder before me again, I will pour all my makeups onto your face. Right. When you go back, throw all my makeups in my room.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cNo, actually I want you to swallow them!\u201d Rong Yi almost roared.Rong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi took a deep breath and made a big smile at Yin Jinye, \u201cdaddy, let\u2019s go.\u201dAfter he said that, he got goose bumps all over.

The sissy pants comes out to make a spectacle of himself. Hm? Why isn\u2019t he walking like a woman this time? Are his feet normal? And he is not wearing makeup?! He becomes like a man!\u201d\u201cPuff! What makes you think he is like a man now? No man is pregnant like him. And there is a man we have never seen being with him. You can\u2019t make a crab walk straight. So he can\u2019t change his nature of flirting with men. I don\u2019 t understand why these men are into such a wussy. Have women died out?\u201d\u201cHe was with his senior brother apprentice last time. The way he gazed at his senior brother apprentice was disgusting as if he was about to eat up that man. This man is as good-looking as his senior brother apprentice. Hm? This son of bitch is girly and slutty but he has a good taste of men.\u201d\u201cHum! Any man with him is no good man. I wonder what makes the sissy pants so attractive to so many men.\u201dRong Yi\u2019s heart skipped a beat on hearing those people mentioned the original owner\u2019s senior brother apprentice. He was worried about that Yin Jinye might jealous. He then guiltily peeped at Yin Jinye. But the other party just turned a blind eye to those people like they were air.He was relieved on one hand, but also moody and down on the other hand. The affair that the original owner of the body had with his senior brother apprentice had nothing to do with him. But why would he feel guilty? Why would he be afraid Yin Jinye might know? Why had Yin Jinye\u2019s indifferent attitude kind of pissed him off?Seeing Yin Jin\u2019s expressionless face, Rong Yi narrowed his eyes and pulled Yin\u2019s sleeve while he raised his voice pointing at the toy vendor, \u201cdaddy, look at those toys for kids. Let\u2019s go have a look.\u201dYin Jinye just let Rong Yi drag him toward the vendor.The crowd was all shocked. Did they hear it wrong? Was the man sissy\u2019s partner?!Rong Yi picked up a paper windmill and said to Yin Jinye as loud as everyone around could hear, \u201cdaddy, what do you think of this toy? Do you think our son will like it?\u201dYin Jinye glanced at those paralyzed crowds and Rong Yi with the toy, and merely said \u201chmm.\u201dRong Yi grinned more dramatically because he responded and picked up a spinning top, \u201cdaddy, this one is good too. Our son will love it.\u201dEvery time he picked up a toy, he\u2019d call Yin Jinye \u201cdaddy\u201d, obviously trying to tell the world who the man was to him.Finally he picked up a ghost face mask, \u201cdaddy, does it look like you?\u201dLooking at the ugly mask, Yin Jinye finally said something, \u201cwhy?\u201d\u201cYou both have a poker face.\u201d sneered Rong Yi.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSir, wrap everything on your booth for me. My son\u2019s daddy will pay you.\u201d Rong Yi said to the vendor while pointing at Yin Jinye.\u201cYou got it.\u201d The vendor\u2018s eyes nearly narrowed into a line due to the big smile since he could made good money.Yin Jinye took the spiritual stones out of his Storage Ring and gave them to the vendor, then put the toys into his ring.As Yin Jinye bought all the toys, Rong Yi was pleased to see how surprised the crowds were. Now they knew Yin Jinye and he were very close, didn\u2019t they?But one thing triggered his curiosity. Was the original of this body really a slut? Why did everybody say so? If he really was so slutty, Rong Su wouldn\u2019t allow \u00a0him to be with his lord and even get pregnant.Then Rong Yi and Yin Jinye arrived at the Ten Fortunes.This time Rong Yi wanted to buy some ordinary ingredients, so he didn\u2019t go upstairs. He just wandered downstairs. When he saw something he needed, he\u2019d ask the salesman to bring it out.Yin Jinye just followed him behind, noticing that Rong Yi was a mature shopper. He had a pair of sharp and fast eyes on detecting those ingredients. There was no chance that he would be fooled with defective materials.Finally the salesman packaged all the ingredients into a bag and gave it to Rong Yi.As Rong Yi was about to take it, suddenly another hand stretched out to grab it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Through the blue gourd-shaped fan print embroidered on the right upper chest of her blue-white gown, one could easily tell she was a cultivator of some sect.\u201cDo you know how to use these ingredients for cultivation, wussy? Hum! You are already 18 years old now but you\u2018ve barely achieved entry level of Qi practicing. The chief should have expelled you from the sect before you defame the entire Nine Void Sect to the ground.\u201d mocked Jin Yueyao as she waved the bag.\u201cHe comes here because he knew that our senior brother apprentice will come here to buy things for his wedding.\u201d Satirized Sun Si, Jin Yueyao\u2019s younger sister apprentice.Song Yi frowned. Damn it! It\u2019s this senior brother apprentice again! So they were fellow apprentices of the original owner of the body. But apparently, they were not very kind to him.A dahs of jealousy flashed in Jin Yueyao\u2019e eyes. She growled, \u201cOur senior brother apprentice won\u2019t marry that ugly woman, nor will he see this bastard.\u201dSu Si didn\u2019t pick up her talk because she knew that Jin Yueyao liked their senior brother apprentice too.Rong Yi had no interest in having a fight with someone unimportant. So turned around and said to the salesman, \u201cGive me another share of the same exact ingredients I just selected. You should charge her for those she grabbed from me.\u201dJin Yueyao was outraged since he totally ignored her, \u201cRong Yi, I am your senior sister apprentice. How dare you ignore me! What makes you think you can ignore me! If it were not for you, our senior brother apprentice wouldn\u2019t marry a woman from Taiyuan Sect. if it weren\u2019t for you, he wouldn\u2019t voluntarily marry into Taiyuan Sect, embarrassing the entire Nine Void Sect. It\u2019s all your fault, you loser! Why don\u2019t you go to hell? Died with your partner when you delivered the baby?\u201dAs she yelled loudly, she got even angrier and threw the bag at Rong Yi. And people gathered around to watch them.Rong Yi was outraged too with veins stood out on his forehead and raised a hand to resist the bag thrown at him.Jin Yueyao, a level-three Base Practitioner, didn\u2019t save a single strength to smash Rong Yi with the bad as if she meant to kill him. She even used spiritual power to push Rong Yi backward.Rong Yi, already clumsy enough for being pregnant, fell down as he lost balance because of the sudden push.As he was about to fall down on the floor, Yin Jinye stretched out to hold him and flipped Jin Yueyao away with a finger of the other hand.Jin Yueyao and Su Si were startled. But when they saw the other party\u2019s handsome face no worse than their senior brother apprentice, they were astonished. Gradually their faces turned red and showed kind of both awkwardness and shyness.\u201cHe is as good-looking as our senior brother apprentice.\u201d Su Si whispered to Jin Yueyao, face reddened.Jin Yue\u2019s heartbeats quickened as she gazed at Yin Jinye.\u201cWhat the fuck! Senior brother apprentice! Always senior brother apprentice! Who the hell\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was angry.Before he finished his sentence, a young man wearing the same outfit as Jin Yueyao rushed into the shop and cried, \u201cSenior sister apprentice, senior brother apprentice is here.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dFuck! He is here right in time! Finally, he could have a chance to take a look at this senior brother apprentice. He wondered how good-looking he could be to drive the original owner of the body and other women crazy.\u201cSu Si, how do I look?\u201d Jin Yueyao checked her dress.\u201cYou look fine. Very beautiful.\u201d Answered Su Si.Jin Yueyao then put on a bright smile and walked out of the door on her tiptoe.Rong Yi looked outside curiously. A crowd wearing outfit of Nine Void Sect walked in. The next moment, a man\u2019s cold voice resounded into his ears, \u201cSee? Your senior brother apprentice is here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a pair of beautiful and clear almond-shaped eyes and thin \u00a0rosy lips. His face was emotionless as if everything was nothing in his eyes.Rong Yi was astonished by his look. If Yin Jinye was as charming and cold as blue rose, the white-haired man was as pure and clean as the only lotus throughout a tranquil lake. No one would have the heart to disturb him.Jin Yueyao signaled Su Si while she shoveled away the crowds, and walked toward the white-haired man with the brightest smile she had, \u201cSenior brother.\u201dRong Yi was shocked. Damn! So this is the senior brother? It explained why the original owner was crazy about him. He was not bad, huh.Su Si pulled a strong and tall man in front of Rong Yi, blocking Bai Yunchen, their senior brother apprentice from seeing him. She also warned Rong Yi, \u201cif you still want to stay in the sect, hide yourself from our senior brother.\u201dIt was exactly what Rong Yi asked for. If Bai Yunchen saw him and came to pick a talk about the past, he might not know how to respond.Bai Yunchen responded and blended into the crowd.People came and go in the shop. No one would notice Rong Yi who was standing at a corner, not to mention that a tall man was deliberately standing in front of him. But Bai Yunchen walked directly toward him as if he knew that he was there, \u201cYi.\u201dHe sounded tenderly but the tall man in front of Rong Yi was frozen to tremble because of Bai\u2019s stare. Finally he couldn\u2019t take it and moved away.Rong Yi wore a smile as he saw Bai\u2019s face and tried to figure out how to say hello to him. But Bai Yunchen already moved his eyes from him and laid them on the arm around Rong Yi\u2019s waist.Bai Yunchen narrowed his eyes and looked at Yin Jinye.Yin Jinye looked directly back into his eyes and didn\u2019t mean to withdraw his arm at all.Rong Yi looked up at Yin Jinye, and then Bai Yunchen. He suddelnly had a comet-hitting-earth feeling.\u201cSuch a wanton!\u201d A mocking sound suddenly broke Yin Jinye and Bai Yunchen\u2019s faceoff, \u201cRong Yi, didn\u2019t you say you love your senior brother Bai Yunchen? Now you are intimate with someone else. Your love is really not worth a damn!\u201dThe Nine Void Sect fellowmen despised Rong Yi as they saw the arm of Yin Jinye\u2019s holding him.Rong Yi had a feeling that he was caught having an affair, \u201cdaddy, we are taken as a bitch couple. What do you say?\u201dDaddy? People were all confused.Yin Jinye stared at the disciple who called Rong Yi a wanton, \u201ccut off his tongue.\u201d\u201cTry me if you can cut off my tongue!\u201d The disciple from Nine Void Sect pulled out the sword around his waist.\u201cPut your sword away.\u201d Bai Yunchen ordered indifferently.The disciple then put his sword away reluctantly, eyes still glaring at Yin Jinye.\u201cIs he the father of your child? Isn\u2019t he dead?\u201d Jin Yueyao asked unbelievably.Bai Yunchen gave Yin Jinye a hard look and then his eyes moved onto Rong Yi\u2019s face, \u201cI will go to visit you in a few days.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Rong Yi had a feeling that Bai Yunchen had perceived that he was different from the original owner.Zhang Xuan, the second eldest brother apprentice, said, \u201cRong Yi, we will have our annual sect competition next month. If you fail again, the chief will expel you no matter how our master Shifu speaks for you.\u201dIn fact, Rong Yi had been out of the Sect for four years, already no difference from having been expelled. But if he was really expelled, Rong Yi had no right to do anything in the name of the Sect.Before Rong Yi said anything, the other disciples all ridiculed, \u201cHe should have already been expelled. If he stays in the Sect, it could only bring shame to our sect. People in other sects are spreading rumors that men in our Sect can get pregnant and give birth to babies. Every time they saw us, they\u2019d mock us using the giving birth joke. We could barely raise our heads in front of them.\u201d\u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t keep such a moth in our sect.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Bai Yunchen\u2018s face sunk.Then those disciples dare not even make a sound.At this time a voice rushed in, \u201cRong Yi? Who is Rong Yi? Get out! Get out! Rong Yi, get out!\u201dPeople all looked outside the door and saw an old man in white.\u201cIt\u2019s Taoist Yunyi.

Now that you mess with Taoist Yunyi, even your father can\u2019t save you this time.\u201d The man who called Rong Yi a wanton pointed at him, \u201cTaoist Yunyi, Rong Yi is here.\u201dYunyi\u2019s eyes sparkled as he heard him. He jumped into the air, flew over the crowd and then landed in front of those disciples.All Nine Void Sect disciples were dying for a good magic weapon that Taoist Yunyi made for them. It was the right time to suck him up. Before Yunyi threw his punch at Rong Yi, they all flattered, \u201cdid this sissy upset you? Just say a word and we will teach him a lesson and he will never mess up with you again.\u201dEven Bai Yunchen thought Rong Yi made a mistake and offended Taoist Yunyi.

I can tell you are father-son the moment I see you.\u201dAs soon as Yin Tao told him that his mom-daddy inscribed the rune onto the sword, he already couldn\u2019t wait and rushed to Yin Mansion but was told that Rong Yi wasn\u2019t home.He was so desperate to know more about the rune, so asked almost every servant in the mansion and finally got to know that Rong Yi came to Ten Fortunes. So he hurriedly came.The disciples were all shocked because they thought Yunyi was here to reproach Rong Yi. But what is this all about that Yunyi is looking at Rong Yi so amiably?Judging from the old man\u2019s expression, it didn\u2019t look like he was here to make trouble, so Rong Yi asked, \u201cIs the Little Cherry you mentioned my son Yin Tao?\u201d\u201cYes. Yes. It\u2019s him. This is not the right place to talk. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Speaking of which, Yunyi tried to drag him away.How could Rong Yi bearing such a big belly move fast? So he said, \u201cPlease slow down. I can\u2019t move fast.\u201dYunyi looked at his big belly and said sullenly, \u201cWhy are you gaining middle-age spread at such a young age?\u201dRong Yi sulked, \u201cI am not. I am pregnant.\u201dYunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dPeople told him that he gave birth to Yin Tao but he didn\u2019t expect it to be true.\u201cSomeone also told me that he is having middle-age spread yesterday.\u201d Yin Jinye\u2019s lips curled.\u201cI am four-year pregnant.\u201d Rong Yi gave him a hard stare, gritting his teeth.He was giving him the look of it-is-you-who-impregnated-me-and-now-laughing-at-me, which made Yin Jinye grin wider.Yunyi became cautious as he heard Rong Yi and slowed down, \u201cbe careful. Watch your steps. Be slow. Be slow! No rush.\u201dHe expected to learn from this man how to inscribe runes. If something bad happened to him, he would have no one to turn to.All the disciples dropped their jaws at how Yunyi treated Rong Yi cautiously while he helped Rong Yi walk. For ages they had known Yunyi, he had never been so kind to anyone and the chief had never enjoyed such preferential treatment.They only came to senses until Yunyi and Rongyi were out of their sight.\u201cIs\u2026is that really Yunyi? Is he a fake one?\u201dThe crowd, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter Rong Yi returned to the mansion, Yunyi introduced himself first and then told them what he was here for, \u201cI am Yunyi, Little Cherry\u2019s master Shifu. Actually today I am here to inquire about the magic weapon making.\u201d\u201cMagic weapon?\u201d Rong Yi was confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cYou inscrived a rune on Little Cherry\u2019s sword, didn\u2019t you?\u201dYin Jinye who was drinking tea signaled Xinghe and others to back off.\u201cYes. It was me. Any problem?\u201d Rong Yi nodded.Yunyi said excitedly, \u201chow did you do it? How did you inscribe the rune onto the sword?\u201d\u201cI used Thunder Fire Arts.\u201d Rong Yi didn\u2019t hide it.\u201cYou used arts?\u201d Yunyi didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cPeople tried before but all failed.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t inscribe it. I enchanted it. You said people tried before. Did he have the mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root?\u201d explained Rong Yi.Yunyi was a little startled, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOnly cultivators with mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root can enchant it.\u201d Rong Yi gave it a second thought, \u201cNo, actually those with Thunder or Fire Spiritual Root can make it too. But the chances are small for them. It\u2019s already good enough if one could make it once out of ten. And and the quality if the rune they enchanted is not so good, maybe only 10% of its original power.\u201dThat was why cultivators with \u00a0Thunder and Fire Spiritual Root wouldn\u2019t waste their time on learning enchanting arts in the world where he came from.As Yunyi didn\u2019t saw how Rong Yi enchanted the rune with his own eyes, he couldn\u2019t believe it, \u201cCan you show me how to do it now?\u201d\u201cSure thing.\u201dYunyi gave him a magic weapon that he made for practice.Judging from the spiritual power of this magic weapon, Rong Yi could tell it had more than level-seven power.\u201cRight now I am only at level-one Qi practicing and don\u2019t have enough spiritual power. I only can enchant non-level or level-one magic weapons.\u201d Rong Yi explained.\u201cIs spiritual power needed too?\u201d Yunyi was surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as magic weapon making or elixir refining. The higher cultivation level you are at, the higher quality of the magic weapons or elixirs you make.\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes at him.Yunyi thought it made sense. So he took out the magic weapon Yin Tao made at school and handed it to Rong Yi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s so ugly!\u201d\u201cYour son made it.\u201d Said Yunyi.\u201cDon\u2019t tell him I said that.\u201d Rong Yi was embarrassed.Yunyi then said urgently, \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell him. Just show me how to enchant it.\u201dRong Yi found a place where the surface of the magic weapon was relatively even and generated spiritual power in his right palm. Then a purple red spark showed up in his palm.Taoist Yunyi stared at his palm without even blinking his eyes.Yin Jinye put down the teacup and moved quietly toward Rong Yi.Rong Yi explained when he was placing his hand on the magic weapon, \u201cThe reason we need Mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root is because it is hotter than either Thunder, or Fire or Gold Spiritual Root. I will melt the surface of the magic with fire, then input my spiritual power into the thunder power, and enchant my rune onto the surface of the magic weapon. Next, I will recover the shape of magic weapon with fire qucikly. There are three steps though, actually they have to be done simultaneously. Only in this case, the original power of the magic weapon could remain undamaged\u2026\u201dIt was easy for him to say. It was truly hard to do. Take melting the surface with fire for example. If the surface was melted over 0.001mm, or the one who did it was not skilled enough, the magic weapon might be ruined.Yunyi and Yin Jinye saw a rune show up where his right palm touched. It was easy for him to do as if he was wiping the sword.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Rong Yi gave the enchanted weapon back to Yunyi.Feeling the rune on the sword, Yunyi was amazed and impressed, \u201cyou did enhance its power. This is unbelievable.\u201dYin Jinye was impressed too, with a flash of astonishment deep in his eyes. He could tell the magic weapon was much more powerful than before. The weapon had had no level at all. But now it could be as powerful as level-one weapon.\u201cI only used the most basic enchanting skill.\u201d Rong Yi wiped off the sweat on his forehead.\u201cAre you saying that there are more powerful enchanting skills?\u201d Yunyi was eager to know.\u201cYes. What I did was only enchanting the rune, which only could enhance its attacking power, defending power, its toughness and speed. If I had proper ingredients, I could enchant more features to it, such as adding poison, or changing its fixed form.\u201d\u201cCan you do that? Could you do it one more time for me?\u201d Yunyi was amazed.\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do it now because I am not powerful enough.\u201dJudging from the sweat on his forehead, Yunyi could tell Rong Yi had already exerted himself to enchant the magic weapon just now, \u201cTake a rest. I will come again to discuss with you about enchanting next time.\u201dActually now he already couldn\u2019t wait to show the enchanted weapon to other Spiritual Weapon Masters.Once Taoist Yunyi left, Yin Jinye immediately said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tell the skill to a man you barely know.\u201dThis was kind of mysterious arts the whole world was craving for. It might incur big troubles since he told someone else so easily.\u201cPeople will find out it eventually. Unless I don\u2019t use it in all my life. Now that I told him, he owes me a big favor.\u201d said Rong Yi, sneering. Of course he understood what he was talking about.Even though there were a lot of cultivators who owned Thunder-fire Spiritual Root, it still wouldn\u2019t work if they didn\u2019t have his rune and enchanting skills.Yin Jinye kept silent as Rong Yi read the situation very well. He ordered Rong Su to serve a cup of spiritual tea for Rong Yi to recover.\u201cDid you throw away all the makeups in my room?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cYeah.\u201dRong Yi blew onto the tea satisfactorily to cool it down. When he was about to take a sip, Yin Tao shouted excitedly outside, \u201cMom-daddy, mom-daddy, I am back.\u201dStraight after, a Cuju (a kind of ball people used to play in ancient China, quite similar to today\u2019s football. If you are interested, you can google the pictures and see what it really is.) hit Rong Yi on the back of his head. His nose directly inserted into the hot tea. He screamed out of the burning pain and threw the cup away.Knowing he made a mistake again, Yin Tao giggled and ran away.\u201cDamn it! I definitely hate kids for a reason!\u201d Rong Yi rolled up his sleeves angrily and pulled a branch of flowers out of the big vase next to him and chased after the kid, \u201cYou silly kid, I dare you not run! I swear I will give you a good beat today, or I will change my surname!\u201d\u201cThen you can change your surname after daddy.\u201d giggled Yin Tao.\u201cDamn kid!\u201dWatching Rong Yi chasing after the kid around holding that clumsy body, Yin Jinye\u2019s lips curled up, which was really a rare scene.At this time, Xing he quietly came by his side and whispered into his ear, \u201cMy lord, are you happy hanging out with Lord Rong?\u201dYin Jinye\u2019s mother especially told Yin Jinye to get along with Rong Yi before they came here. Otherwise, Yin Jinye wouldn\u2019t have agreed to go shopping with Rong Yi so easily.Yin Jinye gave him a look and didn\u2019t say a word, but went back to his yard.\u201cIs he happy or not? He neither said a word nor got mad. Maybe I can take it as he is happy?\u201d Looking at Yin Jinye, Xinghe took a piece of paper out of his storage ring, giving it a thought, and then wrote, \u201cHis lord and master Rong are having a good time.\u201d\u201cHmm. Her ladyship should be very happy.\u201d He folded the paper into a shape of dragonfly which flew out of the mansion with the help of his spiritual power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How would he get close with Yin Jinye if he even didn\u2019t have dinner with him? It was not sensible to drag him out for shopping every day.After dinner, Lei Sai took a big red gift box from his Storage Ring and gave it to Rong Yi, \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\u201cFor me?\u201d Rong Yi raised his eyebrows and joked, \u201cIs it a gift for me? Let me guess. You are giving me this, because you want me to teach you how to enchant. You want to bribe me, right?\u201d\u201cWhy do you bother to ask since you already knew?\u201d Lei Sai snorted.Rong Yi sneered, \u201cIs this your attitude when you ask for help?\u201dLei Sai\u2019s expression changed a bit, and he could only lower his status, \u201cWhat should I do so that you will teach me enchanting?\u201d\u201cOnly if you can please me.\u201d Said Rong Yi while he unwrapped the gift, \u201cI need to see what you\u2019ve got for me.\u201d\u201cYou will love it.\u201d Said Lei Sai.Rong Yi opened the box and saw a bunch of bottles and jars. He picked one up and checked, \u201cWhat are these?\u201d\u201cIt is the most famous makeup brand in the entire Zhonghai Prefecture. Some many female cultivators are lining up for it. Urgh\u2026Ahem\u2026I asked a friend of mine to pull the string and buy such a big jar of pearl powder. Not everyone can buy such a nice jar even if they would like to pay. So what do you say? You like it or not?\u201d bragged Lei Sai.Rong Su was speechless.Rong Yi wished he could pour the powder all over his head, \u201cYou wish!\u201dHe just asked Rong Yi to throw away all his makeup this morning, and now he got another big box of makeup as a gift? How could he be happy?\u201cDon\u2019t you like women\u2019s staff? You even got mad at Tao since you didn\u2019t buy the makeup you like. Now I bought it for you. Why are you still not happy?\u201d Lei Sai was confused.Rong Yi didn\u2019t want to explain to him. He pulled Yin Tao who was still eating chicken claws and said to Rong Huan, \u201cMake an arrangement. This kid and I will move to Biluo Yard from tonight on.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Rong Huan smiled gently.\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Lei Sai stood up and shouted at Rogn Yi who was leaving, \u201csiss\u2026, I mean, young master, can you at least tell me why you don\u2019t like it?\u201dIt was the first time that he tried to kiss up to someone and ended up like this!\u201cHe just asked me to throw all his makeup away this morning.\u201d Said Rong Su.\u201cIsn\u2019t he into those staff? Why did he throw them away?\u201d Lei Sai was confused.Rong Su shook his head, indicating he also had no idea.\u201cWhat the fuck! Does this sissy pants divert his nature?\u201dLei Sai then sat back crossly.After Rong Yi bathed Yin Tao, he held the kid on his lap, \u201cDo you want to spend more time with your father? Do you want to move into his yard? Do you want to sleep on the same bed with him?\u201d\u201cI want to sleep with you, mom-daddy.\u201d Yin Tao nodded happily.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean me. I meant Yin Jinye, your father. And, don\u2019t call me mom-daddy again. Call me daddy. Ok?\u201d\u201cDaddy.\u201d cried Yin Tao.\u201cGood boy.\u201d Rong Yi couldn\u2019t help pinching his cute baby face, \u201cNever call me mom-daddy again.\u201d\u201cDaddy.\u201d cried Yin Tao excitedly while he threw himself at Rong Yi and bit his chest.\u201cOuch! You just bit me again.\u201d He had just grew a little bond with him and thought he was kind of cute, and now again he thought the kid was really annoying, \u201cWhat the hell! This is the last time. If you bite me on my chest ever again, I will squeeze you to death. Ouch! Don\u2019t suck so hard! Damn it!\u201dBut there was nothing he could do. When Yin Tao almost was finished with eating, he immediately pulled him off.Yin Tao burped and giggled.\u201cHow dare you laugh?\u201d Rong Yi spanked him slightly and then applied the ointment Rong Su bought him yesterday to his chest, \u201cIf you want to drink my blood again, just tell me. I will make blood for you.\u201dYin Tao nodded as if he half understood.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go to your father\u2019s yard.\u201d Rong Yi stood up with holding him in his arms.\u201cTo peep him bathing?\u201d asked Yin Tao while putting his arms around Rong Yi\u2019s neck.\u201cTo discuss meaning of life.\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s lips twitched.After the father and son arrived at Biluo Yard, Rong Huan arranged them in the room on the opposite side of Yin Jinye\u2019s room.Looking at the well-lit living room on the other side, Rong Yi said to Yin Tao, \u201cLittle Cherry, when you see your father, remember to call him father.\u201dYin Tao nodded casually, looking a bit unhappy.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He will like you. Don\u2019t stop calling him father until he responds. Do you understand?\u201d Rong Yi could imagine what he had been through. When he was born, his father shut himself up to cultivate. He could only learn about his father from pictures or from the mouths of people around him. When his father was out, he was already six years old. He was not familiar with being around a father but in the meantime, he was eager to get close to him.Yin Tao nodded again.Rong Yi was both amused but mad at him being kind of dispirited, \u201cYou should torment him the way you tormented me. It would be for the best if you could give him a few bites. If he beats you, I will take off his pants and spank him.\u201dYin Tao finally gave a smile.\u201cIf he just ignores you, you can do this\u2026\u201d Rong Yi whispered into his ear, and patted on his shoulder, \u201cOff you go.\u201d\u201cMom-daddy, aren\u2019t you coming with me?\u201d Yin Yao pulled his sleeve.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why do you have to add a mom in front of daddy?\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes at him.\u201cBecause you are both mom and daddy.\u201d explained Yin Tao.\u201cSo that\u2019s what it means.\u201d The original Rong Yi gave birth to him, it was understandable to call him mom. But after all the original Rong Yi was a man, he could only call mom-daddy.Rong Yi pushed him to the doorway and lied to him, After you call him father and he responds, I will come over.\u201dHe just meant to move in tonight so that he could have a better chance to get close to Yin Jinye. But he didn\u2019t plan to interrupt him in case that he got annoyed at him. Right now was a good chance to strengthen father and son bonding, which might be useful in the future.Yin Tao ran out of the room and came to door of Yin Jinye\u2019s room.He peeked inside through the door and saw Yin Jinye was wiping his pagic weapon. He then looked back at Rong Yi.Rong Yi waved at him and signaled him to get inside.Hesitating for a while, and the eagerness deep in the heart of calling him father finally triumphed, Yin Tao then walked inside with that pair of short legs.Rong Yi hid himself by the side of Yin Jinye\u2019s window and peeked inside.Yin Jinye, who was sitting before the table, totally ignored Yin Tao who came inside the room. He only focused on wiping his magic weapon, even every corner and every gap.Yin Tao approached him and looked up, saying carefully and softly, \u201cFather.\u201dYin Jinye gave him a casual look but didn\u2019t answer him.As an outgoing boy, Yin Tao wouldn\u2019t feel wronged or what for being ignored. Since he got no response, he called him again, with an even louder voice, \u201cFather.\u201dYin Jinye neither looked at him nor responded to him.Yin Tao dragged his sleeve, \u201cFather.\u201dRong Yi got anxious outside and cursing Yin Jinye in his heart for being too cold-hearted even to his own child.Since father didn\u2019t scold him or spank him, Yin Tao became bolder and kept calling him, \u201cFather, father, father\u2026\u201dHe called him father again and again, and louder and louder, like he was addicted to it. He got less and less scared. When he almost lost his patience, he suddenly remembered the method Rong Yi had taught him.Letting go of Yin Jinye\u2019s sleeve, Yin Tao climbed up the chair and then the table next to them, giggling at him. Yin Jinye stopped what he was doing and frowned at the kid. What does this little thing want?\u201cFather.\u201d Yin Tao jumped into Yin Jinye\u2019s arms and put his arm around his neck, and kissed him on the cheek.Yin Jinye was startled because no one never been this close to him before. He didn\u2019t know what to do with this kid.\u201cFather\u2013Father\u2013\u201d Yin Tao kissed him as much as he called him father. When his little mouth stuck the face, Yin Jinye felt his lips were moist and soft.Rong Yi who was hiding outside covered his mouth and tittered. He didn\u2019t actually got physical with his siblings no matter how mad he was, after all they were still too young. With a few kisses, their anger would be almost gone immediately.Since it worked on him, a person who hated kids, it would work on Yin Jinye too.\u201cFather. Father.\u201d Yin Tao was really stubborn. He didn\u2019t mean to stop before he got a response.Yin Jinye thought he was really annoying, so he could only answered, frowning, \u201cYes?\u201dRong Yi heaved a sigh of relief. Finally he got a response.Next he heard someone sobbing.Rong Yi was surprised. He turned around and saw a woman tripled the size of him was sobbing and wiping her touching tears with a handkerchief.The fat woman cried, \u201cThis is great! Little master is finally bonding with his father.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Rong Yi asked, eyes twitched.\u201cI am the cook.\u201d Said the fat woman.\u201cI am the chef.\u201d Then another voice said excitedly after her.Rong Yi looked to the window on the other side following the voice and saw a group of people wearing servant uniforms were also peeking inside the room, including Rong Su, Rong Huan and Lei Sai, and over a dozen hanging upside down on the roof. There were over a hundred of them in total.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the heck! There are so many people in the mansion?!He only saw a few in these days. He could imagine how hard those people hid themselves.At the time, Yin Tao\u2019s giggling came from inside the room, \u201cI am gonna sleep with daddy and father tonight.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c!!!\u201d Rong Yi.Why wasn\u2019t the plot going as he had planned?The fat female cook sobbed, \u201cPoor Yin Tao, he had no father and daddy round since he was little.\u201dLei Sai snorted, \u201cWho taught him to say that? Who wants it so badly to set up my lord with that siss\u2026young master?\u201d\u201cThey are partners.\u201d Said Rong Huan flatly.\u201cYoung master. It must be the young master. I told you that young master will fall in love with our lord when he sees him. Now what? After he saw our lord taking a shower yesterday, he already can\u2019t wait to sleep with him tonight.\u201d Rong Su said excitedly.On hearing him, all of them turned to Rong Yi at once.Rong Yi was so angry that he picked up a rock and threw it at Rong Su and precisely hit on the face.\u201cOuch.\u201d Rong Su rubbed his painful face and said, \u201cWhat are you doing, young master?\u201d\u201cHave you seen enough?\u201d The man inside the room said with a deep and cold tone.People outside the room were startled and tried their best to run their fastest speed. Even the fat female cook vanished in an instant. The yard was full of people a few second ago. But now there was only Rong Yi left.Rong Yi rolled his eyes, speechless.\u201cDaddy.\u201d Yin Tao saw Rong Yi outside the window and slipped off Yin Jinye\u2019s body excitedly. He ran out and held Rong Yi\u2019s hand, \u201cDaddy, we are going to sleep with father tonight.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After he dragged Rong Yi inside the room, he rushed to the bed, climbed up the bed same high as his chest, took out tiny pillow and quilts from his Storage Bracelet and put them next to Yin Jinye\u2019s. He patted his tiny pillow and said excitedly, \u201cDaddy, father, come here.\u201dLooking into Yin Tao\u2019s sparkling eyes, Rong Yi had no heart to refuse him. He looked back at Yin Jinye, wishing he could refuse this damn kid.Yin Jinye gave the kid whose smile was bright as sunshine a look, sat down, kept wiping his magic weapon, then said, \u201cYou two sleep first.\u201dRong Yi gave him a hard stare. He meant to let him to refuse the kid but not to allow them to stay.\u201cDaddy. Come here. Daddy. Come on. Come on. Come here\u2026\u201d Yin Tao rolled on the bed.Rong Yi opened his mouth but finally he didn\u2019t refuse him. It was not a big deal to sleep on the same bed with a kid and a man. Besides, since the master of the room agreed, he didn\u2019t need to complain like a girl.He walked to the bed and Yin Tao threw himself at him excitedly, \u201cDad, bedtime story, bedtime story.\u201dRong Yi\u2019s eyes twitched, \u201cI better go back to my own room.\u201dGod must know that he hates kids so that he specially sent this kid to torture him.\u201cDon\u2019t go, daddy.\u201d Yin Tao dragged his sleeve tightly, with both anxiety and expectation in his eyes.\u201cDo you still want bedtime story?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Nodded Yin Tao.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDaddy, come up here.\u201d Yin Tao dragged him onto the bed.Rong Yi sat down, with one leg hanging at the bedside.Yin Tao took off Rong Yi\u2019s shoes as if he was afraid that he would go at any minute.Rong Yi took his shoes by himself as he didn\u2019t want Yin Tao to try so hard to please him.Yin Tao then got down by his side and said, \u201cDaddy, bedtime story.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes secretly. How would he know how to tell bedtime stories? Maybe fairytales from his world? He only overheard a few small stories that his elder brother told his younger brothers. But he didn\u2019t know the whole stories.\u201cDaddy, please.\u201dRong Yi then asked helplessly, \u201cWhy do you want to listen to bedtime story?\u201dYin Tao then answered with jealousy, \u201cOther senior brother apprentices all go to bed with their dads telling them bedtime stories. I want that too.\u201dRong Yi could tell how much this kid wanted love from fathers. He stroked his head and started after thinking for a bit, \u201cOnce upon a time there was a kid whose senior brother apprentices all like to listen to bedtime stories from their fathers. One day, the fathers all disappeared\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did they disappear?\u201d asked Yin Tao out of curiosity.\u201cBecause the senior brother apprentices liked bedtime stories too much to sleep, so Heaven took their fathers away forever.\u201dYin Tao then hugged Rong Yi tightly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you. I don\u2019t want to leave you. Daddy, I am done with bedtime stories.\u201dRong Yi was amused how easily kids were fooled.Yin Jinye snorted while he was wiping the weapon. He expected that Rong Yi could tell a good story. It turned out to be nothing.Giving him a quick look, Rong Yi said to Yin Tao, \u201cI might be taken away by Heaven if I tell bedtime stories. But your father wouldn\u2019t be taken away. We can let him tell us bedtime stories, OK?\u201dYin Tao giggled, \u201cGreat.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t expect Yin Jinye to come over himself, so he went off the bed to urge him, \u201cStop it. The more often you wipe it, the weaker it becomes. You might not notice it at the beginning. But given time, you will realize it.\u201dYin Jinye narrowed his eyes because he really found his magic weapon was not as handy and powerful as before. He always thought that was because he overused it. He even had Spiritual Weapon Maker examine it but found no problems. Was it because he wiped it too often as Rong Yi said?He was then dragged to the bedside.\u201cBedtime story, father.\u201d Said Yin Tao happily.\u201cIt\u2019s too late. You should sleep now.\u201d said Yin Jinye flatly.Yin Tao barely said yes and tucked himself in his little quilt as he was deterred by Yin Jinye\u2019s condescending power.\u201cAlas.\u201d Rong Yi sighed, looking at the damn kid. If he had known that Yin Jinye could make him sleep with only a few words, he would have already made him do it in the first place.\u201cSo should you.\u201d Yin Jinye pushed Rong Yi slightly.\u201cYou mean here?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cHmm.\u201dRong Yi then climbed onto the bed hesitantly.Yin Tao hugged him immediately, \u201cIt feels awesome to sleep with daddy.\u201dRong Yi patted slightly on Yin Tao\u2019s back and closed his eyes. He was worn out after excessively enchanting twice today.Soon he already fell fast asleep.Yin Jinye picked up his magic weapon and checked it, frowning, and decided not to wipe it anymore. After he put it back to his Storage Ring, he heard even breathing sound from Rong Yi and Yin Tao.He looked at the kid first and then Rong Yi. This young man didn\u2019t wear makeups like a woman as his subordinated described. And what was more, he neither was a coward nor was ill-tempered.Before he came, he had already made up his mind to stay strangers with him, but now he had kind of expectations for the future development of their relationship.The minute Yin Jinye was about to look away from Rong Yi, a strand of spiritual power generated from all directions in the air and flew into Rong Yi\u2019s body. If he had no such high cultivation power and he was not focusing on Rong Yi, he wouldn\u2019t notice it at all.\u201cInteresting. You can absorb spiritual power \u00a0even when you sleep.\u201d Said Yin Jingye while curling up his lips.No one else could do that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then quickly dragged the quilt to cover the key part. He then said embarrassedly, \u201cDamn kid, what are you looking at?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Yin Tao pointed at his belly bump innocently.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo the little brother the kid talked about was the baby in his belly. Fuck! He mistook it!Pff! Someone was laughing by the side. It was Rong Su who came to serve them to get up. He didn\u2019t expect the relationship between Rong Yi and Yin Tao would so funny.Even Yin Jinye, who was meditating sitting in the chair, couldn\u2019t help curling up his lips.As he turned around and saw Rong Su was also here, Rong Yi asked grumpily, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI am here to serve you and the little master to get dressed and have breakfast.\u201d Answered Rong Su.\u201cServe him first.\u201d Rong Yi tossed Yin Tao to him.Rong Su then held Yin Tao and dressed him up.Rong Yi then went back to his own room to settle his physiological problem. After he had breakfast, he sent Rong Su to buy the ingredients he failed to buy yesterday, then he casted Spiritual Cohesion Formation in and around his room to improve his cultivation speed.When he was done, he circled around his room satisfactorily to check if there was any problem.\u201cWith this formation, I can promote to Qi practicing level three in one month. Now what I need is a proper magic weapon.\u201d He searched the ingredients Rong Su bought and found those he could use for making magic weapons. He could use them to make a magic weapon that he used to use when he was at the phase of Base Practicing. He didn\u2019t need to use another one before he got promoted to Golden Elixir.He asked someone to get Rong Su. When Rong Su was here, he asked, \u201cDo you know any good but affordable Magic Weapon Maker in town?\u201d\u201cYoung master, do you want to make magic weapons?\u201d asked Rong Su.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cYou can turn to Lei Sai. He is a level eight Magic Weapon Master. You will be amazed by his work, besides, he won\u2019t charge you.\u201dRong Yi sneered, \u201cBefore he learns how to respect me, I won\u2019t turn to him. I would rather make one on my own.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you know how to make magic weapons?\u201d Rong Su was amazed.Of course Rong Yi didn\u2019t know how. All he knew was theoretic knowledge. He never actually performed. \u201cJust tell me who could make affordable but proper magic weapons in town.\u201d\u201cNo one. But you can give it a try on students from Haishan Academy. Some disciples would offer free service to make magic weapons for practice because they are too poor to buy ingredients. Actually the weapons those disciples make are so bad.\u201d\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d\u201cHailu Village outside the town.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go find them.\u201d Rong Yi thought for a bit and then asked, \u201cDo you have any spiritual stones? I need one hundred low grade spiritual stones.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you wouldn\u2019t buy abortion drugs, would you?\u201d Rong Su was prudent.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi meant to pay the disciple who would make magic weapons for him. Since Rong Su reminded him, he could quite probably use the spiritual stones for some aborticide. \u201cI don\u2019t have any spiritual stones with me. Did you take them away from me?\u201d\u201cYoung master, whatever you wanna buy, I can pay for you.\u201d Rong Su didn\u2019t deny.\u201cI just want to pay the disciple who would make the magic weapon for me.\u201d\u201cI will pay them.\u201dRong Su then brought Rong Yi to the backyard and took a cart and headed for Hailu Village then.The houses in Hailu Village were old and shabby. Some of them even had thatched roofs. The grounds were rugged too. But many disciples wearing uniforms of Haishan Academy could be seen here. Some of them stopped the job at hands as they saw a cart coming.\u201cIs there anyone who would like to make a none-level magic weapon?\u201d asked Rong Su as he supported Rong Yi to get off the cart.Some disciples in the village who were not Magic Weapon Makers turned away on hearing him. Some who majored in magic weapon-making were not interested in making none-level weapons, because they thought it was not challenging. Besides, people who came to the village for a magic weapon usually wouldn\u2019t pay. Therefore, they also didn\u2019t want the job.Rong Su shouted as they walked into the village with Rong Yi behind, but no one would offer the help.\u201cYoung master, they are not interested in making none-level magic weapon. Maybe we can tell them we will pay?\u201d\u201cIf they really want to practice their magic weapon-making skills, they wouldn\u2019t be so picky on the levels of the magic weapon they make. They can learn a lot no matter what level of magic weapons they make. Forget it. We are not looking for free\u2026\u201d said Rong Yi.Before he finished his sentence, a disciple said with a panting voice behind them, \u201cCan I, I help you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: RidiculousRong Yi and Rong Su turned around and saw that an about fifteen-year-old comely boy was looking at them shyly.Without getting any response, the young man was afraid they would reject him, so he explained with worry, \u201cI am\u2026I am a level one Magic Weapon Maker though, I once made high quality level-one magic weapons. I assure you I can make high-quality magic weapon for you.\u201dRong Yi saw confidence in his eyes and asked, \u201cWill you make a magic weapon for me if I want you to make it as I want or I may make gestures around?\u201dNormally, Magic Weapon Maker had their own habits. They didn\u2019t like any advice from anyone but their master Shifu or other seniors with higher level. Otherwise, they would think you underestimate them.\u201cOnly if you are right, I will do as what you say.\u201d The boy said earnestly.\u201cOk. You are hired. What is your name? Where do you live?\u201d asked Rong Yi, smiling.\u201cMy name is Zhangsun Ziqian. I live in the hovel over there.\u201d Seeing they were both kind of accommodating, Zhangsun Ziqian was not so nervous as before. He led them to his hovel and said embarrassedly, \u201cMy place is a little shabby. Hope you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201dRong Yi looked around. There were three rooms in the house. A middle-aged man wearing homespun clothes was meditating at the doorway of the room in the middle.Zhangsun Ziqian walked up to him and took out a low grade spiritual stone and out it in front of the middle-aged man, then said in a low voice, \u201cI may need your magic weapon-making furnace, uncle Xiang.\u201dThen he turned back to explain to Rong Yi and Rong Su, \u201cHe is meditating. We should leave him alone.\u201dZhangsu Ziqian then took them inside the room.There was not much furniture in the room. There were only a black furnace taller than a grownup, a bed, a double door closet, a table and two chairs.Zhangsun led them to sit down and poured two cups of tea for them.Rong Su then took the ingredients out of his Storage Ring and handed them over to Zhangsun Ziqian.Zhangsun Ziqian checked the ingredients in front of the furnace and noticed there were two kinds of herbs mixed in, so he picked them out and gave them to Rong Su, \u201cyou mix them with the ingredients.\u201d\u201cI specially put them in the ingredients. You need to blend them into my magic weapon.\u201d Explained Rong Yi.\u201cCan herbs also be used as ingredients to make magic weapon?\u201d both Zhangsun Ziqian and Rong Su were amazed.They had never heard about it.Xiang Lv, who was still mediating outside, was amazed too, with his ears having moved a bit.\u201cYou only know only after you give it a try, but you have to do as what I tell you to do.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian was not an herb expert, but he could tell one of them was Recovery herb which was usually used for healing injuries of bones, nails or hair of human or beasts in a the shortest time.The other kind of herb was Bone-softening herb which could be helpful for healing but also for poisoning. It could soften one\u2019s bones and also objects such as steel or iron. One could deform something or tear it apart while it was softened by the Bone-softening herbs.He checked those ingredients, frowning, only finding they were mostly beast bones. He suddenly had a feeling that maybe herbs might really be used to make magic weapons.\u201cI will give it a try but I am not sure if I can make it.\u201d\u201cRidiculous!\u201d Xia Lv reproached outside the door, \u201cHow can herbs be used to make magic weapons? Ziqian, don\u2019t be fooled. Maybe they are deliberately here to ruin your reputation since they are jealous of your talent. You have been fooled once. It can\u2019t happen again.\u201dRong Yi and Rong Su exchanged an eye contact.Zhangsun Ziqian\u2019s eyes darkened when he thought of last time he got set up by someone. But looking at those ingredients before his eyes, he still had a strong feeling that he wanted to try.He lost in thought for a bit and then said, \u201cI am about to leave this place. Reputation is not so important to me now. Besides, if they really want to fool me, they wouldn\u2019t be silly enough to ask me to make a magic weapon with herbs.\u201dXia Lv knew he wouldn\u2019t change once he made up his mind. He was both mad and helpless, \u201cWhatever.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian then asked Rong Yi, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201dTaking out his drawing, Rong Yi explained, \u201cThe magic weapon I want is a bracelet with 36 small swords of different types hanging on it. See if you can make it.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian took the drawing from him and read every detail, then said, \u201cYes, I think I can.\u201d\u201cYou can start with your own protocol and I will remind you what to do at the proper time.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dXiang Lv stopped meditating as he heard their conversation and walked in and snorted at Rong Yi, \u201cI will watch how you are gonna make a magic weapon out of such soft herbs.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRong Yi told Zhangsun Ziqian about more details of the drawings of the magic weapons. When he confirmed that Zhangsun Ziqian really understood the drawings, the latter was allowed to start.Zhangsun Ziqian sat down with his legs folded. He first threw some of the ingredients into the furnace to melt. When it was about time, he threw another part of the ingredients into the furnace for refinement. Then he used his spiritual power to control the fire to forge the shape of the magic weapon already in his mind.Rong Yi kept a close eye on the furnace, \u201cThe fire you release is mild and seems not suitable for smelting, but it can actually make more exquisite and perfect magic weapons than anyone else. There is a saying that fine products come from slow work. You have this kind of talent. If you keep on practicing, you will definitely have a promising future\u201dZhangsun Ziqian was in a daze. He owned Fire and Water Spiritual Root at the same time, and they were contradictory existence. The former one was often restrained by the latter one, making his release of flame had lower temperatures than others. Therefore, everyone said that his fire was not strong enough to melt hard materials in a short time, and they also said that he was not suitable for being a magic weapon maker. His family persuaded him many times to give up smelting magic weapons, so one could say Rong Yi was the first to say that he was suitable for this job.Seeing the weapon gradually taking shape, Rong Yi picked up the bone-softening herb and handed it to Zhangsun Ziqian, \u201cYou can stop refining now. First, extract the bone-softening herb and make it into liquid medicine to soak the magic weapon. When it is completely soaked by the liquid medicine, then wrap the outer layer of the magic weapon with Water-condensed Stone to prevent your flames from drying up the liquid medicine.\u201dAfter being refined, the Water-condensed Stone would attach to the surface of the magic weapon like a piece of soft glass to protect the potion from drying out. Moreover, the stone had elasticity and could rebound the harm when being attacked by other magic weapons.Xiang Lv nearly choked to his words. He thought it was a must to make magic weapons at one go. He had never heard of making a pause to do other things halfway while making magic weapons. Rong Yi was obviously looking for trouble and didn\u2019t know anything about refining magic weapons. Fortunately, they used some ingredients that were not very valuable, and it was okay to waste them, otherwise, he was afraid that he could not help choking Rong Yi to death.Zhangsun Ziqian nodded and followed Rong Yi\u2019s words. Although he was not an alchemist, he was able to refine potions. In fact, refining potion was very simple, anyone could do it so long as with spiritual power.Xiang Lv and Rong Yi were staring at the changes in the smelting furnace unblinkingly.When Zhangsun Ziqian was going to complete all the steps, Rong Yi taught him how to refine the Recovery herb and other Bone-softening herbs into gel paste, and then put the turquoise-shaped gel paste into the groove of the magic weapon to block the small hole under the groove.The rest of the refining steps would be done by Zhangsun Ziqian himself.Xiang Lv and Rong Su looked at the slowly formed weapons, the kind of disdain and doubt in their eyes replaced by consternation. With eyes wide open, they could hardly believe that herbs could really refine weapons, that was something beyond their cognition.The moment Zhangsun Ziqian was about to end the whole process, the magic weapon sent out a huge aura like sharp arrows rushing outside, immediately caused a stir.The cultivators in Hailu Village felt the fluctuation of this spiritual power and immediately ran out of the houses to watch.\u201cWhere did this spiritual power come from?\u201d\u201cIt seems to have come out of the house of Zhangsun Ziqian.\u201d\u201cHe is a forger? Has he forged the best magical weapon?\u201d Only the highest-quality magic weapon or elixir could emit a huge aura at the moment when the furnace was closed.\u201cNo way. Not long before, someone said that he stole other people\u2019s magic weapon as his own and give it to his master in order to complete the task. His master was very disappointed with him and said that he would be expelled from Haishan College.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\u2019s going on.\u201dEveryone followed the emitting spiritual power to the outside of Zhangsun Ziqian\u2019s yard. When they saw that the aura was coming from Xiang Lv\u2019s room, someone mocked, \u201cI already told you, it can\u2019t be Zhangsun Ziqian refining magic weapons.\u201dXiang Lv was an old-timer in Hailu Village. People dared not go in and look at the situation without permission. However, the shocking voice of Xiang Lv came from the room, \u201cMasterwork, Ziqian, you have made a masterwork?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiang Lv flicked through the rest of the ingredients in the room, but he couldn\u2019t believe the whole story as he looked, \u201cOrdinary, low-grade, medium-grade, and top-grade ordinary materials, none of which can be used as to make a sacred magic weapon. It\u2019s incredible, so incredible, and herbs can actually be used to refine weapons. I guess no one would believe it.\u201dThe magic weapons were divided into nine grades, and each grade was scaled into ordinary, refined, utensil, magical, pure, elite, holy, fairy and divine. Without exquisite, highest-grade, rare, fairy or divine ingredients, it would not have been possible to create magic weapons above pure level.Although Zhangsun Ziqian smelt a none-level magical weapon of holy grade, it was equivalent to a level three refined magic weapon. With it, cultivators in the Base Practicing or Smelting period \u00a0could be free from changing their magic weapons constantly before reaching Golden Elixir \u00a0period. So, this magic weapon was definitely the best magic magic weapon for his personal cultivation. After all, his accomplishments could not drive a level three magic weapon.However, no one would waste precious materials to build low-level magic weapons until the holy magic weapons could be made from materials below exquisite grade.If it weren\u2019t for his eyes staring at Zhangsun Ziqian putting the ingredients into the furnace, Xiang Lv would think the man cheated everyone by mixing other advanced stuff.\u201cHo, holy, holy magic weapon!\u201d Rong Su stammered. He was so surprised in his heart because he bought the ingredients himself. He knew very well that the quality of these things were impossible to make holy magic weapon.Xiang Lv hurriedly asked, \u201cZiqian, how did you make such a holy magic weapon without any rare ingredients?\u201dZhangsun Ziqian looked at the magic weapon in surprise and shook his head, saying that he didn\u2019t understand the reason why, either, \u201cI used mild fire to refine it slowly as I usually do, and I didn\u2019t use any special methods or what during this period.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not because of the refining method.\u201dRong Yi took the weapon to make a double check and then nodded with satisfaction, \u201cBefore I came here, I thought you could only forge an elite magic weapon at most, but I didn\u2019t expect it was a holy one. Mild fire also has its advantages. It can refine the magic weapon more delicate.\u201dThis excited Zhangsun Ziqian, and once again aroused his strong desire to stay here and continue to learn how to make magic weapons.Xiang Lv frowned and asked, \u201cDid you tamper with the ingredients?\u201dRong Yi touched the familiar magic weapon and asked back, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just check the ingredients? Did you find something wrong with them?\u201dXiang Lv only felt strange because of failing to find anything wrong, \u201cHow did he make a holy magic weapon without any tricks?\u201dRong Yi retorted, \u201cWhy do you think ordinary materials cannot produce holy magic weapons?\u201d\u201cSince ancient times, only rare and above-grade ingredients can be used to produce holy magic weapons, and no one has ever made an exception.\u201d\u201cNo exception? At least we can tell from your words that people haven\u2019t given up tries, although they have not succeeded. Failure does not mean impossible.\u201d Before Rong Yi came here, the world he lived in was relatively short of resources, so everyone could only think of other ways to improve the quality of their magic weapons. Of course, a good quality magic weapon could be produced not only by adding herbs but also depending on the abilities and refining process of the forger, as well as its design and functions.This made Xiang Lv irrefutable.Rong Yi put the magic weapon around his wrist and then looked at Rong Su, who was still in a shock and unable to recover. \u201cRong Su, let\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cAh? Oh.\u201d\u00a0 Rong Su soon recovered and took out a hundred spiritual stones from the Storage Ring to Zhangsun Ziqian.\u201cGive him a thousand,\u201d Rong Yi said.The magic weapon made him felt very satisfied and he thought even a thousand spiritual stones was not enough.\u201cYes.\u201d Rong Su then took out another nine hundred.Zhangsun Ziqian hurriedly refused, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to make the magic weapon for you. You don\u2019t need to pay me. Besides, I\u2019ve also learnt a lot from you, and I\u2019ve renewed my understanding of smelting weapons. I am really grateful.\u201dRong Su quickly thrusted these spiritual stones directly into his hand.Zhangsun Ziqian hurriedly gave them back, \u201cI really don\u2019t need these. If you really want to give something to me as a reward, why don\u2019t you give me the rest of the ingredients? My\u2026my magic weapon is broken. So I want to use the rest of the ingredients to repair it so as to take part in the test held by Nine Void Sect early next month. I want to join them and learn from Taoist Yunyi.\u201dWhen Xiang Lv was glad that Zhangsun Ziqian was willing to stay, he looked down upon him with contempt at the same time, \u201cHmm, you truly think you will learn something from him? I don\u2019t like the magic weapons he made.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian smiled gently, \u201cEveryone has his own favorite magic weapon forger. My travel to Haishan College was to learn how to forge magic weapons because of him.\u201dRong Yi did not intend to take away the rest of the ingredients, so he said, \u201cI don\u2019t need them anymore, you may use them as you wish.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Zhangsun Ziqian then quickly followed, \u201cSir, may I ask if you are a forger?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And how could you master the refining method with such accuracy?\u201cPeople with good brains can come up with anything. I think that the ingredients for refining weapons could also be used for refining elixirs. If there is an opportunity, I will find someone to try it.\u201dHis words nearly drove Xiang Lv crazy, \u201cYou mean we do not have a good brain?\u201dRong Yi smiled without saying a word, which was tantamount to admitting that Xiang Lv was stupid.\u201cMost of the smelting ingredients are extremely hard, so I don\u2019t believe that they can be smelted into elixirs and swallowed into the stomach. Whose body can stand it?\u201d Xiang Lv was angry.Rong Yi tittered. Who said elixirs could only be taken orally? Nonsense. Moreover, he did not say that he used the refining ingredients to make elixirs, \u201cIt\u2019s tiring to talk to people with bad brains. Rong Su, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Xiang Lv restrained his anger and asked, \u201cDo you have any other way to make pure or above-grade magic weapons from ordinary ingredients?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI want to buy your prescription.\u201dRong Yi\u2019s lips quirked up and he stretched out one finger.Xiang Lv said, \u201cOne fairy-grade spiritual stone? Well, a reasonable price.\u201dIf he bought the prescription, he could use the ingredients below exquisite quality to make magic weapons above pure grade, and then he could definitely make more money by selling them.Rong Yi smiled playfully, \u201cA fairy-grade spiritual stone? What\u2019s on your mind?\u201dXiang Lv\u2019s face sunk, \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d\u201cOne divine spiritual stone.\u201d\u201cOne divine spiritual stone?\u201d Zhangsun Ziqian and Rong Su looked at Rong Yi dumbfounded.Of all the spiritual stones, the divine one was the best. The rest were low medium, top, highest-grade and fairy one. One hundred low spiritual stones were equal to one medium spiritual stone, one thousand medium spiritual stones could exchange one top spiritual stone, ten thousand top spiritual stones were equivalent to one fairy spiritual stone, and one hundred thousand fairy spiritual stones were equal to one divine spiritual stone. It was conceivable how expensive a divine stone was.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just rob?\u201d said Xiang Lv angrily. \u201cI think you are really crazy about money. If you don\u2019t want to sell it, just spit it out.\u201dRong Su also felt his wits ended with his master, how could he demand such an exorbitant price with just a prescription?Zhangsun Ziqian said, \u201cSir, one divine spiritual stone for a prescription is too expensive and unaffordable for ordinary people.\u201dEven the largest sect would be reluctant to exchange a divine spiritual stone for a low-level magic weapon refining prescription.Rong Yi then said, \u201cIf you really want to become a powerful forger, you won\u2019t think my prescription is expensive.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for his rapid improvement in accomplishments to enable himself to leave this world as soon as possible, he wouldn\u2019t want to sell the refining prescription.Xiang Lv sneered, \u201cEven if I want to be a powerful forger, I will not be willing to spend a divine stone to buy a prescription. Do you think others are fools?\u201dRong Yi picked his eyebrows and said, \u201cIf you are really smart enough, you will buy my prescription, because it is really good.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Anger filled with Xiang Lv\u2019s chest, but there was no denying the fact that Rong Yi\u2019s prescription was really very good and special. However, he was more willing to pay a high price for a more advanced prescription.\u201cA Su, let\u2019s go.\u201dSeeing Rong Yi walking to the door, Xiang Lv hurriedly called out, \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cIt is really expensive to exchange a divine stone for a low-level refining prescription. Can\u2019t it be cheaper?\u201d\u201cDo you want an advanced prescription? Well, 50 divine stones.\u201dHearing this, Xiang Lv almost choked to death by holding the anger.\u201cWant it or not? If not, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cI have no divine stone.\u201d Xiang Lv said gloomily, \u201cBesides offering spiritual stones, can I exchange other things with you? For example, helping you do things.\u201d\u201cYes, sure.\u201d\u00a0 In fact, Rong Yi only wanted spiritual stones, not anything else. However, he casually said, \u201cIf you kowtow to me and take me as your teacher, I will teach you all the prescriptions for refining magic weapons.\u201d\u201cHow is it possible, I am\u2026\u201d Xiang Lv stopped halfway and glared angrily at Rong Yi, \u201cIn short, I won\u2019t worship you as a teacher.\u201dRong Yi said it casually anyway. He shrugged his shoulders carelessly, turned and walked to the door. Then he stopped and took out a spiritual rune from his sleeve and handed it to Zhangsun Ziqian, \u201cSince you don\u2019t want spiritual stones, then this rune \u00a0is yours. You stick it on your magic weapon and tear it off after a column of incense (in ancient times, burning a stick of incense is about half an hour) is burnt out. Don\u2019t refuse to accept it. I am advertising myself. If it works, please help me with the publicity. This one is for free, and I will charge money for the next ones.\u201dThe rune he gave to Zhangsun Ziqian was the Enchanting Rune to enhance the attacks. If he stuck it on a magic weapon, it could increase the attacking effect. He may have to sell the runes to support himself in the future.\u201cWhat is your surname and where do you live, if I may ask.\u201d asked Zhangsun Ziqian.\u201cMy family name is Rong, and I live in Yin Mansion in Tonggu Street.\u201d Rong Yi took Rong Su away after quickly finishing his speaking.\u201cThis guy is really annoying.\u201d Xiang Lv walked up to Zhangsun Ziqian and found that he had never seen the sign on the run before. \u201cWhat a strange sign! I have never seen it before. There\u2019s no sign like this on other continents, I guess.\u201dWith a frown, Zhangsun Ziqian said, \u201cI have never seen it before, either.\u201d\u201cHe asked you to stick it on the magic weapon? You can try it. Anyway, your magic weapon is broken. There is no harm in trying. If it fails, we\u2019ll make another one.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian nodded. He took out his broken magic weapon and pasted the rune on it. Then someone outside shouted, \u201cZhangsun Ziqian! Get out of here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhangsun Ziqian recognized from the voice that the speaker was Song Mao, his fellow disciple, so he went out with his face down.When Song Mao saw him, he gushed in an ironic tone, \u201cYou were indeed in Uncle Xiang\u2019s house. Hum, I thought you would become low-key after stealing my magic weapon to finish the task, or you would be ashamed to stay here and pack up to leave Hailu Village and Haishan College consciously. Unexpectedly, in order to save your reputation, you used Uncle Xiang to help you forge the holy magic weapon, and asked him intentionally to tell everyone it was your work. How shameless you are! You think everyone is an idiot and can easily be fooled? With your ability, you can\u2019t even forge a low-grade magic weapon, let alone a holy one. So hilarious!\u201dHearing this, the disciples from the academy who came to watch the fun whispered in a low voice, \u201cIt turns out that he wants to use the magic weapon made by uncle Xiang to restore his reputation. The man is so shameless. I really thought it was he who made it just now.\u201dZhangsun Ziqian pulled his face long, \u201cSong Mao, I think you know better than me who the real criminal was to steal the magic weapon. What else you can do after you get the quota to enter Nine Void Sect? You still wouldn\u2019t be able to forge a good magic weapon in the following days in there. Sooner or later, everyone will find out that you have no capability at all.\u201dSong Mao then turned to the crowd, \u201cEverybody listen to what he said. He is jealous and even begins to curse me.\u201d\u201cSong Mao, you are the shameless one.\u201d Xiang Lv could not help sneering, \u201cI saw with my own eyes how Ziqian refined the ingredients and made a first-class magic weapon. What about you? Seeing Ziqian truly made it, you\u2019ve become jealous. On one hand, you sucked up to Ziqian and asked him if you could borrow his work to study how to make a real magic weapon, while on the other hand, you shamelessly publicized that you were its true maker. You even colluded with your evil fair-feather friends to let them be your witnesses and then returned the magic weapon to Ziqian. When he handed his work to your master, you jumped out and claimed that he stole your magic weapon. Didn\u2019t you think your behavior disgusting? I have never seen such a scheming villain in Hailu Village for all these years. People like you are destined to walk not far on the road to real cultivation. Sooner or later, you will get yourself destroyed. You will never defeat your devil in the heart on the road of promotions.\u201dSong Mao\u2019s face sunk, \u201cUncle Xiang, you are can\u2019t speak for him just because he shares a yard with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. The villagers and the disciples who came here at the same time with me all know who I am. I won\u2019t take sides with him just because he lives in my yard. Everyone, if you believe me, you should also believe Ziqian instead of this flunky.\u201dDisciples from the academy who knew the characters of Xiang Lv began to speak for him, \u201cI believe Uncle Xiang, he treats everyone with no difference and only sticks to the truth instead of taking side with his close friends. Since he said he saw with his own eyes, the real forger must be Zhangsun Ziqian.\u201dSeeing everyone gradually shifting sides to Zhangsun Ziqian, Song Mao became ferocious, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of your quibbling? Even our master shifu believes Zhangsun Ziqian stole my magic weapon as his own assignment.\u201dXiang Lv sneered, \u201cYour master must have taken your spiritual stones in private. Is that why he is partial to you? If he really wants to cherish real talents, he should ask you two to refine the magic weapons again before the public, and then he will be able to tell who is the real thief.\u201dRealizing that Xiang Lv had figured out the truth, Song Mao was both anxious and angry, \u201cI respect you as an old-timer, so I won\u2019t argue with you. But if you continue to talk nonsense, don\u2019t blame my rudeness.\u201d\u201cAre you angry because I told the truth?\u201d said Xiang Lv with his arms crossed, \u201cI\u2019d like to see how you would deal with me, and how you would hurt me with your weak spiritual power.\u201dBeing looked down upon, Song Mao was so angry that he took out a level one pure magic weapon reserved for his assignment and rushed to Xiang Lv, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know how miserable your fate would be if you look down upon on me.\u201dAt the same time, Zhangsun Ziqian picked up his magic weapon to block in front of Xiang Lv. With a loud \u201cclang\u201d, the two magic weapons collided together.Song Mao sneered, \u201cYour level one ordinary magic weapon can\u2019t compete with my pure one, don\u2019t daydream.\u201dXiang Lv was also worried that Zhangsun Ziqian would not be able to handle this. So he persuaded him, \u201cZiqian, step aside, let me handle this. I will make him suffer, otherwise, he would think we are easy to be bullied.\u201d\u201cUncle Xiang, I am responsible for the incident. I want to solve it myself and do not want to get you into trouble.\u201d Zhangsun Ziqian infused his spiritual power into the magic weapon, and then the magic rune stuck on the weapon fell off to the ground.Xiang Lv looked down and saw that the rune on the figure was missing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiang Lv looked up again at Zhangsun Ziqian\u2019s magical weapon. The sign on the magical figure were like scarred in the weapon, flashing golden red light.All of a sudden, the weapon made a humming sound, giving off a powerful spiritual force and offensive power, which shook Song Mao away instantly.\u2018Crack\u2019, a gap appeared on Song Mao\u2019s magic weapon, and he felt its power was much weaker for a slight moment.Song Mao looked at the long sword in his hand with a shocked face and said with disbelief, \u201cTwo days ago, I cut a crack on your magic weapon. It was clearly not as powerful as before, and its grade is lower than mine. How could it shatter my pure magic weapon?\u201dZhangsun Ziqian was also very surprised, he obviously felt the magic weapon\u2019s offensive power was much stronger than before, no inferior to the level two refined one.He couldn\u2019t help but take a glance at the sword in his hand and found that the previous rune was gone. Instead, a new run the same as the one on the paper rune appeared on it.Was its power enhanced because of the rune?Without thinking too much, Zhangsun Ziqian picked up the sword and chopped at Song Mao.The powerful attack scared Song Mao back and he shouted. Then he was stumbled by a small stone pit and fell to the ground.Those people around him laughed at his timidity and overcautious, he was scared out of his wits for only an ordinary confrontation. How could a fighter be like this before reaching the point of life and death? Such a wasted loser!Song Mao, who had never been so humiliated, was both ashamed and angry. He quickly got up and picked up his magic weapon and hacked toward Zhangsun Ziqian.However, Zhangsun Ziqian\u2019s swordsmanship was better than Song Mao\u2019s. He dodged the attack and split Song Mao\u2019s magic weapon in halves.\u201cZhangsun Ziqian, how dare you break my magic weapon prepared for the task? I\u2019m going to tell the master about this and ask him to kick you out of Haishan Academy so that you can\u2019t get along in the Haishan City.\u201d Knowing that he could not beat Zhangsun Ziqian, Song Mao was so angry that he threw the hilt at Zhangsun Ziqian and turned to leave.\u201cHe is simply a baby not weaned. What he only knows is seeking for his master\u2019s help in face of such a small thing. With his capabilities, he could not even step out of Hailu Village.\u201d With a sneer, Xiang Lv looked at Zhangsun Ziqian\u2019s magic weapon, \u201cWhat happened to your magic weapon? It is even better than before with stronger power even there\u2019s a crack on it.\u201d\u201cIt is Rong\u2019s rune that has enhanced the offensive power of my magic weapon,\u201d Zhangsun Ziqian stroked the rune on the sword and said in surprise, \u201cThe rune has been integrated with my sword, just like it cannot be erased after being carved on it. Moreover, it not doesn\u2019t damage the body of the magic weapon, but also has improved its offensive power.\u201dToo many things had happened today to surprise him, even beyond his imagination, making him more and more curious about who Rong Yi really was.After hearing this, Xiang Lv quickly brought the weapon over to take a close observation. It was really like what Zhangsun Ziqian said. Xiang Lv exclaimed excitedly, \u201cIt is like being pasted a level two attack magic rune, but the effect is better than that. The rune is neither as easy to drop as the paper one, nor as easy to be damaged like a paper one. And it will never damage the power of the magic weapon. How did he make it? By the way, where does he live?\u201d\u201cYin Mansion, Tonggu Street..\u201dWhen Rong Yi returned to Yin Mansion, he hid himself in the room of Biluo Yard to enchant the magic weapon.Rong Su went to the study to tell Yin Jinye about the detailed smelting process he saw in Hailu Village.Yin Jinye picked his eyebrows after hearing him.Lei Sai, who was playing chess with Yin Jinye, did not believe the whole story and he stood up, \u201cIt is impossible. How could he make holy magic magic weapon only with the ingredients below exquisite quality? I do not believe it. You must have made a mistake.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can go and see the young master\u2019s magic weapon yourself,\u201d said Rong Su.At this moment, Rong Yi\u2019s voice came from outside, \u201cA Huan, A Huan, do you have any medicine that can paralyze a man\u2019s whole body and make him unable to move for a short period of time?\u201dRong Huan replied, \u201cYes, but it can only deal with cultivators in the Base Practicing and Qi Training period, and it can only make the other side unable to move during a deep breath.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, do you have any potion that can make people poisoned immediately?\u201d\u201cYes, although the potion will not kill people, it can make the cultivators in the Base Practicing and Qi Training period feel uncomfortable or vomit blood and fall to the ground immediately.\u201d\u201cGood, give them to me.\u201dRong Huan hesitantly took out the potions, \u201cYoung master, what do you want these potions for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d Rong Yi smiled mysteriously and returned to his room with these potions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe word \u201csecret\u201d aroused everyone\u2019s curiosity, just like a goose feather tickling everyone\u2019s heart.Lei Sai could not resist his curiosity, so he went out of the study and creped down \u00a0to the window outside Rong Yi\u2019s room. He poked through the white paper on the window with his finger quietly, then leaned his head forward and looked in through the small hole.Rong Su and Rong Huan also followed him to spy on Rong Yi.In the room, Rong Yi carefully opened the bottle cap of the potion, drove the magic weapon on his wrist, turned one of the small swords hanging on his bracelet into a normal size, and then used his spiritual force to suck out some poison potion.The potion floated on his palm and turned around, then it was drawn from a round shape to a rectangle with its own swift movement. Slowly, the surface of poison potion showed a rune.Rong Yi\u2019s palm turned down and he slowly rubbed across the tip of the sword from a distance. Then, a small green rune appeared on the tip of the sword, indicating that he enchanted the magic weapon successfully.He took a sip of spiritual tea, turned over the hilt, and attached the anesthetic to the end of the hilt in the same way. After that, he changed the sword back to its original form, and then used the same method to enchant the remaining 35 small swords to improve their various properties.At the same time that the last small sword was enchanted successfully, Rong Yi\u2019s magic weapon once again radiated strong spiritual power from its body.\u201cThat\u2019s an upgrade!\u201d Lei Sai suddenly widened his eyes and stared tightly at the magic weapon in Rong Yi\u2019s hand. Unable to restrain his shock and excitement, he cried out, \u201cA well-made magic weapon could even get an upgrade?\u201dHe had been refining magic weapons for hundreds of years, and had never seen refined magic weapon could be further upgraded.Hearing the sound, Rong Yi turned his head and saw three figures bending over the window. Several holes were punctured in the window. He twitched at the corner of his eye and shouted angrily, \u201cDamn Peeping Tom!\u201dRong Su responded very quickly, \u201cYoung master, I\u2019ve come to call you for dinner.\u201d\u201cWas it necessary to pop my window when asking me for dinner?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s broken by the wind. I\u2019ll get someone to fix it.\u201d Rong Su quickly ran away.Rong Su the said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and see if the little young master has come back.\u201dRong yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dLei Sai was still standing outside the window.Rong Yi just ignored him. He put away the magic weapon and went out of the room. Seeing Yin Jinye was still standing at the door of the opposite room, he immediately smiled, \u201cDaddy, I found someone to make very good magic weapons today. I\u2018d like you to appreciate it.\u201dYin Jinye looked at him without making any response.Just when Rong Yi thought he would refuse, he nodded slightly and gave a slight grunt.Rong Yi added, \u201cHow about having dinner and at the same time appreciating it?\u201dYin Jinye directly turned to the front yard.Following him, Rong Yi came to the hall holding his big belly. As soon as he sat down, he took down the bracelet and showed it to Yin Jinye, \u201cI will learn sword and practice sword cultivation. The 36 small swords under the bracelet are my later magic weapons.\u201dYin Jinye looked at them carefully. It was really like what Rong Su said. The ingredients of the weapons were made of those below level one exquisite quality, but the power of the magic weapons were far more than level one, and he noticed that the shape of each sword was different. Some were like knives, some were like spears, and some were like bows and arrows.After hearing Rong Yi\u2019s words, Xinghe who followed them in said, \u201cThe practitioners in the early stage of sword cultivation are extremely weak, and they can\u2019t beat the opponents for immortal cultivation in the Base Practicing when they come to Sword Enhancement stage. Only when they reach Returning Origin stage can they gradually show the strength of sword cultivation. For this reason, during this period, many sword trainers give up their practice and only a handful of them have been able to practice until reaching the Holy Path stage. Moreover, none of them can succeed in Doom Overpowering.\u201dSword cultivation, like immortal cultivation, could be divided into nine stages, namely, Qi-condensing, Defense-cultivation, Sword-enhancement, Origin-returning, Enlightenment, Sword-merging, Unity, Holy Path and Doom Overpowering. When the sword practitioners tried to reach the Doom Overpowering stage, like evil cultivation and ghost cultivation, they had to go through the thunder-crossing power, but several times stronger, so it was difficult for sword cultivation practitioners to become immortal. However, among all practitioners, they had the strongest offensive power, which was much obvious in the Holy Path stage, apart from the immortal without a given post in heaven and the Earth Immortal, no one would be their opponent.Rong Yi flattered his husband smilingly, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Daddy got me covered. I\u2019m sure I can survive the Sword Enhancement period and become a great swordsman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xinghe looked at his master with a face of speechlessness.Yin Jinye picked up Rong Yi\u2019s magic weapon and asked curiously, pointing to a small thing hanging on the bracelet like a sword, \u201cDo you still use a short knife or a spear to cultivate your swordsmanship?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRong Yi asked in reply, \u201cAre there any rules to forbid using a knife or spear in sword cultivation?\u201d\u201cSword cultivation, literally we call it sword cultivation only when we use a sword to cultivate.\u201d Argued Xinghe.\u201cAre you saying that you can\u2019t call it sword cultivation when you use other shapes of magic weapons to attack others?\u201dXinghe, \u201c\u2026\u201dSome magic weapons were not necessarily sword-shaped. Sometimes they could be shaped differently according to different functions.Rong Yi lifted the chair and moved toward Yin Jinye a bit and asked, \u201cDaddy, isn\u2019t my magic weapon wonderful?\u201dYin Jinye held it in his hand, \u201cIt is a great magic weapon for cultivators below Base Practicing and Qi Practicing. It was equal to a level three magic weapon. Before you promote to Golden Elixir\u2026\u201dBut thinking that Rong Yi just said he wanted to be sword cultivation, he changed his words, \u201cbefore you get to Sword-enhancement stage, you don\u2019t need to change your magic weapons.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you tell what kind of ingredients I have used?\u201d asked Rong Yi.In fact, he already knew that Rong Su had told Yin Jinye about everything in Hailu Village after they came back.Yin Jinye didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cDo you want to know how I managed to make such a holy magic weapon out of ordinary ingredients?\u201dXinghe\u2019s eyes sparkled, looking at Rong Yi with expectations. Unfortunately, Yin Jinye still kept his mouth shut. No one knew whether he wanted to know or not.Rong Yi ignored his coldness, took the magic back and put it on, saying smilingly, \u201cIf you want to know more details, I will continue at dinner time tomorrow.\u201dHe didn\u2019t tell it all because he wanted Yin Jin to have more dinners with them, so he could have a chance to get along with him and grow their bonds.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dXinghe rolled his eyes. He wished he could give this man a beat.What was the difference between saying it now and tomorrow? Why would he tantalize them like this?\u201cDaddy, father, I\u2019m home.\u201d Yin Tao cried excitedly as he entered the yard, \u201cDaddy, father, I am home.\u201dRong Yi watched the little kid run in and asked, \u201cWhat makes you so happy today?\u201d\u201cMaster Shifu bought me a lot of toys.\u201d Yin Tao sat down next to Rong Yi, \u201cHe also got presents for you, daddy.\u201d\u201cYour master Shifu is\u2026\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cIt was Taoist Yunyi. He said that he didn\u2019t bring you a gift as he was in a hurry yesterday. And you helped him to enchant his magic weapon while you are still so heavily pregnant. He said he owes you big. So he bought a greeting present for you. And he also said that he will pay you another visit in a few days.\u201d Explained a servant who served Yin Tao today.\u201cIsn\u2019t he being too polite? After all, he is a senior to me.\u201d Rong Yi asked Yin Tao, \u201cWhat present does your master Shifu get for me?\u201dYin Tao then took out a white bottle from his Storage Bracelet, opened it clumsily and poured it into an empty glass on the table, then handed it to Rong Yi happily, \u201cDaddy, here, drink it.\u201dRong Yi checked the milky liquid in the glass and sniffed it. It had kind of light odor. He then asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDaddy, drink it. Come on! Drink it!\u201d Yin Tao reached for the cup and held it to Rong Yi\u2019s mouth, \u201cDaddy, drink it. Drink it.\u201d\u201cStop urging me. I will drink it now.\u201d Thinking Yunyi wouldn\u2019t do harm to him, Rong Yi sipped a bit, \u201cIt tastes like milk. Very good. What\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cYunyi said it is a she-evil beast\u2019s milk.\u201d Said the servant as Rong Yi almost finished drinking.\u201cWhy did he give me this?\u201d Rong Yi wondered.The servant said awkwardly, \u201cTaoist Yunyi heard the little master often doesn\u2019t have enough milk to feed, so he specially got this to stimulate the secretion of milk.\u201d\u201cPfff!\u201d Rong Yi spitted the milk in his mouth onto Yin Tao\u2019s face, \u201cAh-hem! Ah-hem\u2026What, what, what did you say? Stimulate the secretion of milk using this?\u201dWhat the fuck? He was a man.

Suck it. Suck it.\u201dYin Tao took a look at his wrist and then his breast.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. You can only suck this.\u201d Rong Yi then held his hand at his mouth.Yin Tao then tamely opened his mouth and sucked it.Xinghe asked, frowning, \u201cDoes the little master have to suck blood on a daily base? Can\u2019t he quit it?\u201d\u201cHe will be fine after half-a-year recovery.\u201d Explained Rong Huan as he walked in.\u201cThe good thing is the other one is still in the belly. Otherwise he couldn\u2019t take it if the twins suck together.\u201d\u201cOh man! Can you not keep reminding me of the other child I am carrying in my belly right now?\u201d said Rong Yi while holding his forehead.Xinghe couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud again.This time Yin Jinye\u2019s lips curled up even higher.Rong Yi was kind of absorbed in his smile. This man looked more charming when he smiled, like a blooming white flower under the moonlight, shimmering with a a light fragrance, making one hard to move his eyes from him.Yin Tao suddenly burped after getting full.And it brought Rong Yi back to his senses and he realized that he lost his mind because of a man\u2019s smile. He rubbed his forehead gloomily and rushed them to serve the meal to cover up his embarrassment, \u201cDinner time. Dinner time.\u201d\u201cRong Su already asked then to serve dishes.\u201d Said Rong Huan.\u201cThen why are you still standing there? Grab a seat.\u201dRong Huan and Xinghe didn\u2019t move.In the past, only Yin Tao sat there eating alone, so Rong Huan , Rong Su and Lei Sai would sit to eat with him. But now that he had Rong Yi and the master, of course they had to obey the master-servant rules.Born in a big family, Rong Yi of course knew the rules. If masters were too easygoing, servants might lose their sense of propriety and eventually forgot who the master was.Since Yin Jinye didn\u2019t say a word, he didn\u2019t insist on asking Rong Huan and others to sit.Soon, Rong Su and the chef came in holding the dishes.\u201cThis dish tastes good. Have a try.\u201d Rong Yi picked a shredded chicken into Yin Jinye\u2019s bowl.Yin Jinye looked at the chicken in his bowl but didn\u2019t pick up his chopsticks.\u201cEat.\u201d Rong Yi kept picking dishes for him.\u201cMaster Rong, he is on fasting. He doesn\u2019t eat.\u201d Explained Xinghe.\u201cSo what? He can still eat food, otherwise he will miss so many gourmets.\u201d Before Rong Yi had transmigrated here, he would normally have three meals a day even if he was not very hungry, so would his family. And there was a rule in their Rong family. Unless a closed-up cultivation or working outside, the family had to have dinner together for family affection. The entire family also had an annual banquet every year to bond with each other. \u201cAs people always say, \u2018you only live once\u2019. Since we have a long life ahead, if we couldn\u2019t enjoy life but only focus on cultivation, we wouldn\u2019t know what joy is before they die. What a waste of prolonged life after we cultivate so long!\u201dEveryone thought what he said was reasonable, so no one argued.After putting a hunk of meat into his mouth, Rong Yi continued, \u201cIn my opinion, the reason why you fast is because you don\u2019t want to do a poo.\u201dCultivators had to go to toilet after eating real food. But it would be different if they took spiritual food. Most of spiritual food could be transformed into spiritual power.\u201cWatch your language.\u201d Yin Jinye\u2019s lips twitched a bit.Rong Yi \u00a0gave him a hollow laugh.\u201cPfff!\u201d Rong Su laughed, \u201cYoung master, what you said really makes sense.\u201dYin Yao, who was digging his food, then raised his head and said, \u201cDaddy, I am not afraid of pooping.\u201d .Rong Yi asked out of curiosity, \u201cThen what are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cI am afraid of wetting bed.\u201dRong Su laughed even harder now.Rong Huang also couldn\u2019t help smiling.\u201cYou should sleep alone tonight.\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes.Yin Tao then pouted, a little unhappy, \u201cNo, I want to sleep with daddy.\u201d\u201cNo, you may pee on me in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not peeing on daddy.\u201d\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t know when you are asleep even if you pee.\u201d\u201cI would turn my face to father before going to bed, and when I wet the bed, I would pee on him. I would not pee on daddy.\u201d\u201cOK! That\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Rong Yi laughed.Even those servants in the room were all amused by Yin Tao\u2019s kiddo talk.\u201c\u2026\u201d Yin Jinye then turned to Xinghe, \u201cCan this kid be remade?\u201dXinghe got struck dumb, he never expected the master would also crack a joke, then he answered smilingly, \u201cI am afraid it\u2019s too late.\u201dRong Yi then picked another hunk of meat and put it in Yin Jinye\u2019s bowl, \u201cEat, eat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYin Tao buried his head in the bowl to continue digging his food.Seeing all of them were enjoying their food, hesitated though, Yin Jinye picked up his chopsticks and put meat that he hadn\u2019t tasted for hundreds of years into his mouth. A strange but nice taste of food spread throughout his mouth.\u201cWhat do you think? Is it delicious?\u201d asked Rong Su.Yin Jinye responded with an \u2018hmm\u201d slightly.Seeing Rong Yi pick some dishes for Yin Jinye, Yin Tao quickly stood up from the chair and scooped a spoonful of beef with a spoon covered with rice, \u201cEat, father.\u201dYin Jinye frowned. Obviously he didn\u2019t like it.Rong Yi smiled and said, \u201cSee how your son is filial to you! He even picks beef for you! Now you don\u2019t want him to be remade, do you?\u201dLooking at Yin Tao\u2019s smiling face, Yin Jinye picked the rice stuck on the beef silently and then put it in his mouth.Watching this scene, Xinghe immediately took out a paper and pen to write down what happened last night and tonight and draw a picture of them three of them having dinner together for her ladyship.After dinner, Rong Yi went back to his room, began to cultivate after taking a bath.Yin Tao cried, wanting to sleep with him. So he also went back to Rong Yi\u2019s room.When Rong Yi activated the formation, all the surrounding spiritual Qi was absorbed into his room. In order not to waste the precious spiritual Qi, he asked Yin Tao to meditate for half an hour before going to sleep.As soon as Yin Jinye who was in the room on the other side detected a special movement of spiritual Qi, he walked out and saw spiritual Qi gathering into Rong Yi\u2019s room. Thanks to the formation, the spiritual Qi was filtered to pure Qi and generated a swirl above the roof of Rong Yi\u2019s room.As long as the one in the room was cultivating, the swirl would keep transmitting the spiritual Qi, which would effectively improve the speed of absorbing the spiritual Qi.Yin Jinye, who had never seen such Spiritual Cohesion Formation, wore a smile. That guy in the room on the other side always knew something others didn\u2019t and surprised him again and again.After watching the other side for quite some time, Yin Jinye then went in to take some rest.Rong Yi was still filled with joy when he began to cultivate because the spiritual Qi in this world was abundant, which was equivalent to ten times of his world. It could help him promote very quickly. But half an hour later, as the spiritual Qi became less and less, there was less he could absorb.Rong Yi then opened his eyes, \u201cIs it because of the formation?\u201dBut he checked today. Everything was fine. He started smoothly. But how couldn\u2019t he continue?Rong Yi closed his eyes and tried again, but still failed. He stood up and walked outside,.After walking around the house and having confirmed the formation was fine, he became more confused.Looking up at the starry sky, a huge amount of spiritual Qi was flying into his room, meaning that the formation was functioning normally.\u201cSince there is spiritual Qi gathering, why do I absorb so little?\u201d Rong Yi walked out of the eaves and looked up onto the roof.It was when his anger outburst.At this moment the roof was crowded with people.All servants in the house were sitting on the roof for cultivation, absorbing all the pure spiritual Qi he had gather with his formation.\u201cYou thieves!\u201d Rong Yi was so angry that he took of a little sword off his magic weapon and wanted to throw it at those people on the roof. But considering it was a taboo to disturb those who were cultivating, and might even get possessed due to any carelessness, he could only hold the sword in his hand.Finally he put away the sword and sulked, \u201cFine! Just tonight!\u201dRong Yi went back to his room depressively. He was even angrier looking at the kid sound asleep, \u201cI told you to cultivate for half an hour, but you are only sleeping here.\u201dHe went over and poked his soft and chubby baby face, then couldn\u2019t help pinching it.Then Yin Tao got woken up by his daddy and opened his sleepy eyes, \u201cDaddy, I want milk.\u201dRong Yi\u2019s mouth twitched, he then covered Yin Tao\u2019s eyes, \u201cYou better sleep.\u201dYin Tao then fell asleep again immediately.Rong Yi lay down on the bed and also closed his eyes to sleep after staring angrily at the roof.The next morning, Rong Su entered the room with a basin of water in his hand refreshingly. He first greeted Rong Yi and then woke up Yin Tao, \u201cLittle master, wake up. Time to get up\u2026\u201dHe held little Yin Tao who was still sleeping in his arms and cleaned his face, then put on the little robes for him before he took him to the hall for breakfast.As Rong Yi sat down, he smiled at all servants in the hall, \u201cDid you guys have a smooth cultivation on my roof last night? Did anyone promote? Are you feeling refreshing today?\u201dOn hearing him, everyone lowered their heads guiltily and started to do their own job.\u201cYou knew that, young master?\u201d said Rong Su, putting on a smile.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even absorb any spiritual Qi. How would I not know?\u201d Rong Yi said angrily.Rong Su then smiled awkwardly, \u201cSorry, young master. Since you absorbed all spiritual Qi into your room, we had none to cultivate then. So we could only climb onto your roof.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Fine. He was being selfish to channel all the spiritual Qi into his room. He forgot others also needed to cultivate.Rong Su then sucked up and said, \u201cCan you extend your formation outside the mansion and absorb all the spiritual Qi outside into the house?\u201dNow all servants in the hall were staring at Rong Yi with their beaming eyes.Yesterday, they had absorbed the purest spiritual Qi since their cultivation, and their cultivation speed was nearly three times fast than usual. If they could absorb pure spiritual Qi on a daily basis, they could promote much faster.\u201cFine. Buy some ingredients first.\u201d Looking around at the servants, Rong Yi nodded.\u201cBravo! Wonderfu! Hooray\u2026\u201dall the servants jumped and cheered.Rong Yi smiled as he was also inspired.Yin Tao had no idea why they were happy. But since they were so cheered up, he also shouted with joy in his chair, \u201cGreat! Great!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going right now.\u201d Rong Su ran excitedly out of the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He already came back with all the ingredients only after Rong Yi finished his breakfast.\u201cYoung master, I am back.\u201d Rong Su put all ingredients on the table in front of Rong Yi, looking a little gloomy.Seeing the lipstick marks on his face and robes, Rong Yi was a bit surprised and then teased him, \u201cWhere did you get those lip prints? You didn\u2019t go to the brothel to buy those things, did you?\u201d\u201cYour sisters are here, young master.\u201d Answered Rong Su, gritting his teeth and wiping his face.\u201cAh?\u201d Rong Yi was surprised, \u201cMy sisters?\u201dDid the original owner have siblings?\u201cMy Yi, sweetie, we are here. Why don\u2019t you come out to welcome us?\u201d At this time a skittish but masculine voice came from the hall.Rong Yi got goose bumps by the ladyboy-like voice. Then four womanly overdressed tall people walked in.When he saw their faces, he almost choked by his own saliva.The four persons were overdressed in pinks and purples, with thick rouge and pearl powder on their faces, and pretty braided buns. Judging from their dresses and makeup, they should be girls. But what the hell was that patch of black stubbles and bulgy Adam\u2019s apples?\u201cYi, my sweetheart, it\u2019s been quite a few days you haven\u2019t dropped by. Do you still take us as your best friends? Say that you are going to spend the day with us.\u201d Qi Yueshi in purple dress held Rong Yi\u2019s hands, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to your room and have some girls\u2019 talk.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was greatly intimidated by them, \u201cYou\u2026are you my sisters or brothers?\u201dPfff~ Rong Su who had been wearing that long face couldn\u2019t hold himself and laughed! What a sharp question!\u201cI hate you. How can you ask me such a question? This is kind of rude.\u201d Qi Yueshi dragged him out of the hall and all the way to the room that Rong Yi used to live in, \u201cZhu Xinyu, Tang Shangru, Zhong Ziqiao, take out the things you have refined and show them to Yi.\u201dRong Yi realized that they were not biological sisters when he heard their names. They were just his gay friends who shared the same \u2018hobby\u2019 as him. Just now he almost thought the entire family liked dressing up like women like the original owner.Zhong Ziqiao, Zhu Xinyu and Tang Shangru then took out one thing out of their Storage Ring separately and put them on the table.Zhu Xinyu said triumphantly, \u201cI made this, Down Feather Skirt, level one pure thing.\u201dRobes, belts, headpieces, ornaments, shoes and other things worn by cultivators were all refined by Spiritual Costume Refiners. All the products had certain defensive power. They were classified into nine levels like magic weapons, and each level had nine grades: ordinary, refined, utensil, magical, pure, elite, holy, fairy, and divine.Zhong Ziqiao took the rune embroidered with the yellow cloth and waved it in front of Rong Yi, \u201cThis is level one Rune Spirit.\u201dLike weapon and devices, runes and formations had nine levels. Every level of runes had five grades: Rune Soldier, Rune Spirit, Rune Treasure, Rune Supreme, and Rune Emperor. Formations had four grades: Small, Medium, Large, and Epic.Tang Shangru also showed off the formation embroidered with blue cloth, \u201cThis is level one medium formation I made.\u201dLooking at those cocky faces, Rong Yi frowned, thinking, \u201cWhat is there to be proud of? Just some level one things.\u201d Did they mean to insult him because they knew the original owner was a loser? But they didn\u2019t look like they did. They reminded him of his second elder brother and his friends. They also often came to his second elder brother with some low-level magic weapons and discussed with his elder brother privately in the room.He also remembered that his brother also used to try to discuss with him about those low-level things but he refused, which made his brother feel frustrated for quite a long time.Now seeing that Zhong Ziqiao and others all had the same look as his elder brother, he suppressed the impatience in his heart and said, \u201cWhy are you showing me these things?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQi Yueshi and Zhong Ziqiao looked at each other, picked up the Down Feather Skirt and pointed to the patterns on it, \u201cWe have embroidered formations and runes into the dress to enhance its defense. Can you see the formations or runes?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Rong Yi stared at the embroidery on the skirt for a while.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s more beautiful than embroidering runes or formations directly onto the robes?\u201d asked Zhong Ziqiao with some joys on the face.\u201cIt does look better.\u201d Nodded Rong Yi.In modern world, because it was not beautiful to embroider runes or formations onto one\u2019s clothes, so they usually embroider them inside the clothes. A designer later designed them into beautiful patterns and embroidered them on the outside of the clothes, which were a big hit not only among cultivators but also commoners. Many designers tried to copy him but they were never as good as that designer.Qi Yueshi said amusedly, \u201cWe are thinking to sell such kind of embroidered skirts. What do you say, my Yi?\u201dRong Yi stared at him for a while and then asked, \u201cSo after all these bullshit, you actually want to open a shop, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhu Xinyu said, \u201cNo one has ever done this before. So we want to be the first ones. We can also sell girl stuff too, such as specially made rouge, pearl powder and cosmetic elixirs for three reasons. First, we can make easy money out of girl stuff; second, since our products are affordable for those poor cultivators who have no spare money; third, there is no such a shop in Zhonghai Prefecture. We want to give it a go.\u201dQi Yueshi took out an elixir he refined, \u201cLook. This is a level one medium beauty elixir I made, which can make girls\u2019 skin tenderer and much smoother.\u201dElixirs had nine levels and each level had five grades: low grade, medium grade, high grade, immortal grade and divine grade. He was just an a-few-year entry-level Spiritual Elixir Maker. He was already good enough to make level one medium elixir.Rong Yi raised his eyebrows. Those lay-boys did have business acumen. He had no ideaw whether his second elder brother would also talk about those things when staying with his rabbles. \u201cWhat if people copy you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will have new arrivals every month to attract those customers.\u201d\u201cSince you have such a good plan, you should start as soon as possible.\u201d urged Rong Yi.Their design not only was exquisite and colorful, but also had superb craftsmanship, as natural as though they were living. If they could open a shop to sell those things, they would definitely be saleable among girls.\u201cBut we don\u2019t have startup fund.\u201dQi Yueshi and others looked at each other embarrassedly and said spontaneously.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was speechless.\u201cYou know we are all displaced people, and besides, we are Spiritual Costume Refiner, Spiritual Elixir Maker, Spiritual Formation Master, and Spiritual Rune Master, so we need to spend a large number of spiritual stones on ingredients to improve our proficiency in the early stage. Apart from our daily living expenses, we really don\u2019t have extra spiritual stones to open a shop.\u201d Explained Qi Yueshi.\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cSo we want to borrow some spiritual stones from you. Each of the five of us will have 20 percent of the profit. You don\u2019t need to do anything but getting your share by the end of the month.\u201d\u201cWhat if you lose?\u201d\u201cIf we lose, we will try every means to pay you back.\u201d They said without hesitation.Rong Yi could tell that they were accountable although they dressed like women. But he didn\u2019t have any spiritual stones on him. He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them the truth as he saw their expectations and confidence on their faces. Besides, he also needed a place to sell his enchanting runes and other stuff.\u201cHow many spiritual stones do you need?\u201d asked Rong Yi with hesitation.\u201cFifty \u00a0upper grade spiritual stones.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dIn modern world, fifty upper grade spiritual stones were nothing to him. But now it was really a problem to him.\u201cYou should know that I don\u2019t have any spiritual stones right now. I need time.\u201dQi Yueshi and others all nodded, \u201cWe totally understand your situation. If it\u2019s really hard for you, we can try another way.\u201d\u201cYou go back first and I\u2019m gonna give you a reply by tomorrow or the day after.\u201dQi Yueshi then said, \u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cGee~\u201d Tang Shangru suddenly screamed, \u201cI just had a feeling that our Yi is different today. Now I see that he is not wearing makeup.\u201dThe rest also had the same feeling. This man also didn\u2019t speak like a girl as he used to be. He became very decisive.\u201cI will never wear any makeup from now on.\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You look so much better now, I think.\u201d Tang Shangru then put the things they refined back into his Storage Ring and resumed the way before they discussed the business, waving their handkerchief, \u201cYi, we should go now. By the way, is there any chance you let Rong Su see us out? He is a handsome and has a nice body. He is my type. Hee hee, when I came, I couldn\u2019t resist it and kissed him all over.. Oh my god. I am blushing. \u201d said Tang Shangru.Rong Yi couldn\u2019t stand their sissy behaviors which gave him a lot of goose bumps, \u201cRong Su is in charge of the spiritual stones. If you still want them, you\u2019d better leave him alone.\u201dKnowing the information, they dare not insist letting Rong Su walk them out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter they left, Rong Yi went to Rong Su. To convince Rong Su that he was not going to have the abortion with the spiritual stones, he told Rong Su the business plan Qi Yueshi had before he asked if he could have fifty upper grade spiritual stones.The first question that popped out of Rong Su\u2019s head was, \u201cDoes it mean that they won\u2019t come here that often after they open a shop?\u201d\u201cIf they open a shop, they should be busy with refining elixirs and embroidering clothes. How can they have time to come here?\u201dRong Su took out a bag of spiritual stones to a servant nearby quickly, \u201cCatch up with them as quickly as you can and give these five hundred upper grade spiritual stones to Childe Qi and tell them to buy as many as cloth and ingredients. And, tell them that they don\u2019t need to worry about shop lease. Tell them our master has a big shop in the downtown area which they can use. The only thing they have to take care of are their products.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The servant took the bag of spiritual stones and ran away.Rong Su exhaled. With that bag of spiritual stones, Qi Yueshi and his friends could keep busy for months for their refining and embroidering work, meaning that they wouldn\u2019t have time to come to Yin Mansion and him in particular.Rong Yi teased him, \u201cAre you scared of them?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you know what, every time they see me, they jump at me like they\u2019ve never seen a man before. They fumble on me and even kiss me.\u201d On mentioning Qi Yueshi and his friends, Rong Su immediately pulled his face. If it hadn\u2019t been for Rong Yi, he would have already beat all of them up.Rong Yi then asked, \u201cI just asked for fifty upper grade spiritual stones but you gave them five hundred. Aren\u2019t you afraid they are here to swindle money??\u201dRong Su forced a smile, looking away guiltily.\u201cYou investigated them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d asked Rong Yi.Rong Yi didn\u2019t reply, basically admitting it.Rong Yi snorted.Afraid that Rong Yi might get mad at him, he hurriedly explained, \u201cI investigated them because I am worried about you making bad friends.\u201d\u201cThen what did you find out about them?\u201dRong Su said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t lie to you. They are indeed from big families. They ran away from home because their strange hobbies were not accepted by their families. They met on their ways to Haishan City. Actually they are all quite talented. But without family support, they don\u2019t have supplies such as spiritual stones and all kinds of ingredients. That is why their cultivation is at such a slow pace.\u201dRong Yi was surprised by their family background.Rong Su then asked shamelessly, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s getting late. Isn\u2019t it time to arrange the formation?\u201dRong Yi felt both funny and annoyed by his question, \u201cWhere are the ingredients?\u201d\u201cI have them.\u201d Rong Su took out the ingredients from his Storage Ring, \u201cI am not sure what kind ingredients you are gonna need. Except for those for refining magic weapon, I also bought everything you asked me to buy yesterday.\u201d\u201cThe house is too big. I need a few hands.\u201d Nodded Rong Yi.\u201cOK, all on me.\u201dRong Su gathered Rong Huan, Lei Sai and Xinghe.They went outside the mansion and Rong Yi taught them how to lay out the formation.Looking at Rong Yi who was explaining to Lei Sai and Xinghe, Rong Su whispered to Rong Huan, \u201cHey, Huan, have you noticed that our young master has changed these days? He no longer wears makeup or bound his feet, so girly anymore. Although he sometimes yells at the little master from time to time, he is never really mad. If he has changed just because he got greatly stimulated by his senior brother apprentice\u2019s marrying someone else, how to explain that he suddenly knows a lot of things that we don\u2019t know? Is it because he used to hide those skills from others? Or\u2026he got possessed?\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, Rong Huan asked, eyes narrowed, \u201cWhich do you think is better, the present young master or the one before?\u201d\u201cThe one now, of course.\u201d Rong Su said without hesitation.\u201cThen there is nothing to bother. Just leave him as he is now. Our master will will have his own judge.\u201dRong Su nodded.At that moment, the footman guarding at the gate walked in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I don\u2019t want to see him\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got no right to make decisions for the young master. Besides, the guest has already indoor. It\u2019s rude to send him away,\u201d Rong Huan said softly while giving Rong Su a look.Seeing Bai Yunchen come in, Rong Su whispered anxiously, \u201cWill the young master return to his original temper after seeing him?\u201d\u201cWhat must be must be.\u201d Rong Huan said. Seeing Bai Yunchen come over, he and Rong Su who had a long face greeted, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, cultivator Bai.\u201dWhen Bai Yunchen was bowing to them, he saw that Rong Yi was explaining \u00a0how to lay out the formation to Lei Sai and others. Seeing that he was infusing spiritual power into the formation, he narrowed his eyes and asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhen did Xiaoyi gain spiritual power?\u201dRong Huan told as what it was, \u201cTwo days ago.\u201dAfter Rong Yi\u2019s explanation, Lei Sai and others started to arrange the formation by themselves. Then Rong Yi turned around and was stunned to see Bai Yunchen, but soon he came to his mind and greeted Bai Yunchen with a gentle smile, \u201cSenior brother, you are here.\u201dRong Su who was fixing his eyes on Rong Yi breathed a sigh of relief seeing he didn\u2019t pounced at Bai Yunchen like before.Bai Yunchen smiled faintly, \u201cFeel comfortable to walk around the yard with me?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dThen Rong Yi took him to stroll in the big garden of the central courtyard.Rong Su quickly followed up but was being stopped and dragged collar by Rong Huan.Rong Su got anxious, \u201cDon\u2019t stop me, I\u2019m going to watch them, lest the young master has feelings for his senior brother again.\u201dRong Huan then released him and said, \u201cThere are lots of servants in the central courtyard who will supervise young master\u2019s every move. Your main task now is to report to the master that Bai Yunchen is here and see how the master reacts.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll report to him now.\u201d Rong Su quickly left and came to Yin Jinye\u2019s study at his fastest speed, \u201cMaster! Master!\u201dThe butler scolded, \u201cWhat makes you in such a hurry that you even forget the rules?\u201dYin Jinye, who was sitting on the chair, did not even lift his head.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Alas\u2026\u201d Rong Su could not care about so much and came clean, \u201cYoung master\u2019s senior brother is here.\u201d\u201cThen, why are you so fussy about such a small thing? Do you need to rush to the study in such a hurry?\u201d Finishing this, the butler suddenly he said something wrong and immediately tried to make up, \u201cYou mean the senior brother Bai Yunchen?\u201d\u201cWho else could it be?\u201dThe butler took a glance cowardly at Yin Jinye who was still reading. Then he asked, \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d\u201cThey went to the central courtyard to admire the flowers.\u201dThe butler coughed softly, \u201cI see, you can leave now.\u201dRong Su still wanted to continue but was stopped by the butler\u2019s eyes.He looked at Yin Jinye immersing in books and walked out of the study depressingly. It seemed that the master didn\u2019t care about it at all. After all, the two of them had only met for a few days. It was impossible to develop some feelings for the young master in such a short time.After Rong Su left, there was no sound of turning pages in the study. It was so quiet that even a needle could be heard falling to the ground.The butler kept peering at Yin Jinye, thinking his master might care about the man.After a long time, Yin Jin suddenly called, \u201cWen Chuan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wen Chuan quickly came to him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your order, my lord?\u201d\u201cWhen does Yin Tao finish school?\u201d\u201cAt noon. But, the little master sometimes has lunch in the school, then continues to study refining and comes back in the evening.\u201dYin Jinye glanced at the sky outside, then got up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon.\u201dWen Chuan froze for a moment, but quickly understood his meaning and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare the carriage for you right away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One could barely walk holding such a big belly, while the other had to slow down to cooperate his pace.Neither of them spoke, and the trees in the courtyard rustled with the summer wind.\u201cAlas, our young master\u2019s senior fbrother is here again.\u201d A servant nearby said.\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss,\u201d said another servant. \u201cOur master is in the mansion now. There\u2019s no way that others will steal the young master away.\u201d\u201cWell, judging from every perspective, our master is the more attractive one.\u201d\u201cIf the master was not charming emough, the young master would not sleep in the master\u2019s room the next night after he returned.\u201dBai Yunchen glanced at the servants nearby flatly.Rong Yi\u2019s mouth twitched, his head tilting to the servant, and said with his teeth gnashed, \u201cCan you keep your \u2018private conversation\u2019 down a bit?\u201dHoly crap!Were they afraid that people might not know that they were deliberately letting Bai Yunchen hear that?The servants made a hollow laugh and went on with their jobs at hands.Rong Yi turned to Bai Yunchen and pointed to the pavilion on the rockery in front of them, \u201cSenior brother, there are few people over there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAfter coming to the pavilion and confirming that there was no one around, Bai Yunchen immediately asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dRong Yi winked at Bai Yunchen, \u201cSenior brother, are you losing your head in the sun?\u201dEven if Bai Yunchen had found out that he was not his junior brother, he did not intend to confess everything to a stranger. No one knew whether this person would be against him or not.\u201cXiaoyi is a soft person, speaks gently, and is very reserved when laughing. He easily gets shy and will never look me in the eyes like you do.\u201d\u201cPeople change.\u201d\u201cEven if they change, it is impossible to change so abruptly in such a short time.\u201dRong Yi laughed, \u201cSome people become demons overnight, changing from great good to great evil. How can this be explained? What\u2019s more, I was stimulated when I heard that the person I like married someone else and I even received a wedding invitation from him. Oh, I already feel lucky enough that I haven\u2019t gone crazy.\u201dBai Yunchen, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was true that some people became evil overnight, and from then on, they got out of the right path and went to the road with no return. But the man in front of him really changed because of the stimulation?Bai Yunchen become uncertain, but he was sure of one thing: If this man was really possessed, people in Yin Mansion would not sit by and do nothing.\u201cI think the way I am now is especially good. I\u2019m no longer sissy. I no longer got bullied by others, which worries you. By the way, I heard a senior sister said, the day before yesterday, you married into Taiyuan sect because of me. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d Bai Yunchen said softly, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I need to marry anyone from Taiyuan Sect anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dBai Yunchen did not answer. Instead, he took out some gadgets from his Storage Ring, \u201cI brought some little toys from Zhonggu Prefecture for Tao\u2019er.\u201dRong Yi gave him a bright smile, \u201cThank you, senior brother.\u201dBai Yunchen hadn\u2019t seen his junior brother smile like this for a long time, and his mouth curved up with a slight radian involuntarily, \u201cIf you are bullied here, tell me, don\u2019t get yourself wronged, if you are unhappy here, I can take you away at any time.\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cI was unhappy before, why didn\u2019t you take me away?\u201dBai Yunchen\u2019s smile gradually disappeared, his eyebrows twisted and he remained silent.Rong Yi didn\u2019t ask him more when he saw Bai Yunchen might be awkward to disclose his secret. Anyway, he was not the original owner of this boyd. It didn\u2019t matter whether he knew it or not.Just then, a voice came from the door leading to the backyard, \u201cMaster, the carriage is ready.\u201dHearing this, Rong Yi quickly stood up and walked to the edge of the pavilion. Seeing Yin Jinye\u2019s shadow, his eyes suddenly became bright and he waved, \u201cDaddy, daddy, daddy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could never miss it. So Rong Yi hurriedly stepped down the stone stairs with her baby bump, \u201cWait for me, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\u201cYoung master, slow down, slow down, be careful.\u201d As Rong Su who was hiding in the dark to peep saw Rong Yi descending the stone stairs so fast like a ball rolling down the stairs, his heart nearly pounded out of his throat and he immediately rushed out to give him a hand.Wen Chuan took a glance at Bai Yunchen in the pavilion and said with unction, \u201cYoung master, Mr. Bai is your honored guest. Is it appropriate for you to leave him here alone?\u201d\u201cOh, right! I forgot that my senior brother is still here.\u201d Rong Yi went down the stairs and looked back and shouted, \u201cSenior brother, I\u2019m going out. I\u2019ll come to entertain you when I\u2019m back. Hey, daddy, don\u2019t walk so fast, wait for me. Wait!\u201dSeeing Yin Jinye stepped faster, he hurried to catch up.\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yunchen looked at the back of his departure and twisted his eyebrows. Before, his younger brother always wished he could stay here and never leave. Now, the boy did not care about him anymore. The change was too thorough. Even the way he treated him had changed, and the toys he brought here also suffered from cold reception.Rong Huan walked to the rockery and asked, \u201cCultivator Bai, our young master will be back soon. What about you have some rest in the guest room first?\u201dBai Yunchen knew very well that people from the Yin Mansion did not welcome him,s so handed over the toys to Rong Huan, \u201cI have something to deal with now, I\u2019ll come to visit my junior brother and Tao\u2019er again when I have time.\u201d\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Rong Huan then sent Bai Yunchen out of the mansion.When Bai Yunchen came to the gate, he happened to see Rong Yi \u00a0getting into the carriage. Then, Rong Yi\u2019s chirping voice came from it.\u201cHee hee, daddy, why do you suddenly want to pick up our son? Do you miss our son? You always immerse in reading books. What are the goods for those books? You should look at me more. I\u2019m much more useful than books. I\u2019m well-educated and knowledgeable. You can ask me anything you don\u2019t understand.\u201dThen, Yin Jinye\u2019s steady voice came from the carriage, \u201cDo you know what these are?\u201dInside the carriage, Rong Yi looked at the seal characters Yin Jinye was pointing at and his smile froze immediately. He looked at the other party in embarrassment and then at the words in the book, and then asked in a low voice much less confidently, \u201cI don\u2019t know these characters, can you read them to me?\u201dYin Jinye was speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo this was your well-educated and knowledgeable?You could not even recognize those characters!Rong Yi hurriedly explained, \u201cI just can\u2019t recognize what they are, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know what they are. As long as you read them to me, I can definitely explain them to you. I\u2019m serious, you have to believe me.\u201dYin Jinye just ignored him.At the coachman\u2019s urge, the carriage quickly left.Bai Yunchen turned to Rong Huan and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say your master is dead?\u201d\u201cWe really thought our master was dead at first, and we didn\u2019t know he was still alive until two years ago. In order not to stimulate the young master and avoid adding more exhaustion for his pregnancy, we have been hiding it from him until now.\u201dBai Yunchen stopped asking more and turned to leave.Rong Su immediately came to Rong Huan\u2019s side and said with a smile, \u201cOur master is charismatic. In just a few days, he has won the young master\u2019s heart and let him forget his beloved senior brother already.\u201dRong Huan said softly, \u201cSuch an outcome is good for everyone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were all dressed in uniforms and could not tell who each of them was.Rong Yi stood on the seat on his tiptoes, holding his belly, and looked at the gate of the school for fear that he might accidentally miss his child\u2019s coming out.With time passed, more and more carriages left, but fewer and fewer children came out of the school, and Rong Yi still did not see Yin Tao.The wheeler said, \u201cYoung master, the little young master may have been kept by his teacher.\u201d\u201cKept by his teacher?\u201d Seeing that no one came out of the school any more, Rong Yi asked, \u201cCan we go in and look for little Cherry?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The wheeler walked over and quietly slipped each of the gatekeepers a medium grade spiritual stone.One guard casually asked the reason why they had to enter the school and nodded in agreement.The wheeler came back and said, \u201cMaster, young master, we can go in.\u201dYin Jinye was the first to get out of the carriage.The wheeler immediately bowed and knelt on the ground, letting his master step on his back.Yin Jinye stepped on him without any hesitation.Rong Yi clicked his tongue, \u201cWhat a spoiled kid! You cannot even step off the carriage without stepping on someone\u2019s back?\u201dYin Jinye looked back at him and walked towards the school.\u201cHey, daddy, won\u2019t you help me down?\u201d Rong Yi looked at the height more than three feet, and then at Yin Jinye, who was getting farther and farther away, he felt depressed, and sighed to his baby bump, \u201cLittle Sensen, you are so pathetic. Your father already has an older son, so he doesn\u2019t care about you at all. Well, doesn\u2019t matter. You only need to be filial to me in the future. As for your father, you can send him to hell while he is overpowering his predestined doom (Doom overpowering often appears in xianxia or xuanhuan novels. When someone is promoting to an immortal or a higher level or something like that, one has to overpower his doom first, like getting struck by lightning or what, then one could get promoted).\u201dThe wheeler felt embarrassed, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe man is so ruthless, thought him.\u201c\u2026\u201d Hearing his words, Yin Jinye, who had already gone far, twitched his mouth and came back with his hands offering to Rong Yi.Rong Yi smiled happily and put his hands on Yin Jinye\u2019s, \u201cThank you.\u201dYin Jin said in a light tone, \u201cYou are really spoiled.\u201d\u201cThis is a must.\u201d Rong Yi held out his swollen belly, \u201cIf you were like me, you would be more spoiled than me, huh!\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRong Yi bowed his head and said to the baby in his stomach, \u201cLittle Sensen, for the sake of your father coming back to support me, let\u2019s forgive him and give me a chance.\u201d\u201cLittle Sensen?\u201d Yin Jinye asked, \u201cThe baby\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cYes, I decided to call this child Yin Sensen.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe coachman, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYin Sensen, homephone with\u00a0\u9634\u68ee\u68ee(its pinyin is also yin sen sen) (\u9634\u68ee\u68ee\u2019s pinyin is yin sen sen, which means spooky in English. Actually he is being sarcastic of Yin Jinye using this homophonic thing because Yin Jinye performs kind of spooky.)\u00a0 isn\u2019t it easy to remember?\u201d Rong Yi said proudly, \u201cMy father\u2026Ah-hem, well, my father gave me my name Rong Yi(\u8363\u4e49\u2019s pinyin is rong yi in English, homephone with\u00a0\u5bb9\u6613\u00a0which means easy in English), because it is easy to remember(actually he is trying to defend himself after being sarcastic in the former sentence.). Moreover, my name is of great significance. Its pronunciation is similar to \u201ceasy\u201d. It\u2019s a hope that I can easily go through difficulties and fight for glory for myself and my family. At the same time, I cannot forget about morality, righteousness, and kindness. What do you think? Is my name good?\u201dYin Jinye frowned lightly, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the name Yin Sensen?\u201d\u201cIt will make people think he is really something, and they will feel self-distrustful in front of him, which is tantamount to winning without fighting.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The wheeler would like to observe a moment of silence for the future of the second little young master.After entering the school, the wheeler led the way and soon found Yin Tao\u2019s classroom.Rong Yi and Yin Jinye stopped outside the window to look at the children who were refining magic weapons and then found that the kids were all sitting far away from Yin Tao.At first, they thought Yin Tao chose that seat himself. But later, they found that the truth was not as what they had thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYin Tao was sitting in a corner near the door. All the other children were two meters away from him, like they were in two worlds. Those children were talking and laughing lively, while Yin Tao was very lonely, in sharp contrast.The lesson was about refining magic weapons. Those children could walk freely to discuss with other disciples, and they could also go to fetch the required ingredients as they wanted.Some younger children were very naughty. They saw Yin Tao sitting alone in the corner and went to rob his ingredients and throw them into his smelting furnace, causing big problems in the refining process for Yin Tao.Jin Tong, who was in charge of supervising the children\u2019s refining magic weapons, did not blame those naughty kids, but reprimanded Yin Tao loudly, \u201cJunior brother Yin, how can you learn the refining without keeping your own ingredients? And how many times have I told you that the refined magic weapon should not only be good in grade but also beautiful in shape? Do you think the one you have refined could really be called a magic weapon? It even can\u2019t compare with a piece of shit.\u201dSpeaking of which, he began to poke Yin Tao\u2019s head with his finger. \u201cIf you fails today, you don\u2019t have to go back home. Stay here and learn how to refine the shape of the magic weapon well.\u201dEven a passer-by who saw this scene would feel very angry, let alone Yin Tao\u2019s parents. Rong Yi asked the coachman, \u201cWhere is the guard who came with Little Cherry? Where is he?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go find them.\u201d The wheeler then went to bring the guard.When the guard saw Rong Yi and others, he hurriedly saluted.Rong Yi tried to suppress his anger and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this boy? He should know that Little Cherry was only a three-year-old child, and he has just begun to learn refining magic weapons. Of course, the refined weapon by him is not as good as those made by adults. Why is he so strict with my kid while let loose of those kids who destroyed others refining ingredients?\u201dIn fact, the guard was already full of anger, \u201cYoung master, little young master has been bullied since he entered the school. His senior brother Jin tong, jealous of his talent and Taoist Yunyi\u2019s preference for him, has always been against him, pushing, scolding, and making things difficult for him no matter what goes wrong. I wanted to stop it, but there is a rule for class and no irrelevant person is allowed in.\u201dRong Yi stared at Jin Tong and asked, \u201cWhat is wrong with all the other kids? Why are their seats so far from my Little Cherry?\u201d\u201cThose kids\u2019 guards let them do this, first, to play up to Jin Tong, second, out of jealousy. They think that Taoist Yunyi is too partial to the little young master while totally neglects the existence of other children, so they ask their little young masters not to play with him\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe guard went on to say, \u201cYoung master, please don\u2019t blame me for being outspoken. In fact, there is no need for the little young master to come to school to study. He can learn it quite well at home under Lei Sai\u2019s guidance.\u201dIn the beginning, everyone agreed that Rong Yi should send Yin Tao to the school because there was no one playing with Yin Tao at home, and because if he stayed at home, he had to endure Rong Yi\u2019s bad temper, so they meant to send to school to play with other kids. But how could such a thing happen?Rong Yi asked, \u201cAre you saying little Cherry should quit from school?\u201dThe guard nodded.\u201cWhy is it us to leave?\u201d Rong Yi squinted at Jin Tong and said, \u201cEven if someone has to leave, it should be him!\u201dAt this time, Yin Tao infused some spiritual power into the smelting furnace and turned the fire to the maximum. With a loud bang, flames shot out of the smelting furnace, but soon went out, and then a first-grade ordinary magic weapon was forged.Yin Tao jumped with joy, \u201cI made it! I made it! Senior brother, I made it!\u201dLooking at the first-grade magical weapon in Yin Tao\u2019s hand, Jin Tong turned very gloomy. Some time ago, Yin Tao had no way to refine the first-grade magic weapon. Only in a few days, he had made it. No wonder their master shifu liked Yin Tao so much.\u201cWhat is there to be cocky of? Huh? What is there to be cocky of? Do you think you are good at refining now?\u201d Jin Tong\u2019s jealousy deep in his heart broke out in an instant. He pointed to the magic weapon in Yin Tao\u2019s hand and shouted, \u201cLook how ugly it is. Is this even a magical weapon? I think it\u2019s a piece of shit. Genius in refining? Bullshit! You\u2019re not suitable for refining at all. Go home and suck your daddy\u2019s milk!\u201dHis crazy roar and ferocious face not only frightened Yin Tao, but also other children. Suddenly, the whole classroom quieted down.Jin Tong was panting due great anger. After he regained some sanity, he found everyone was staring at him, and his face instantly went stiff. He quickly grabbed the magic weapon in Yin Tao\u2019s hand and turned around and said, \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201dAll kids were dumbfounded when they heard the word dismissed. Then they cheered loudly, \u201cSchool is over! Yay! I can go home! Yay\u2026\u201dYin Tao was also very happy and quickly ran to the gate.Seeing this, his guard rushed to the gate to pick up the boy, \u201cLittle young master.\u201dYin Tao held his hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore the guard finished speaking, suddenly, someone pushed Yin Tao\u2019s back hard from behind. If it hadn\u2019t been for the guard, Yin Tao would have fallen on his face.\u201cSenior brother is angry all because of you.\u201d Those two kids who pushed Yin Tao from behind were exactly those who came to Yin Mansion to show off their magic weapons last time.After getting pushed by no reason, of course he had to push back! After Yin Tao got on his feet, he immediately got into a clinch with the two bigger kids, even with swear words out of his mouth.The situation of Yin Tao\u2019s guard was no better than his little young master. On one hand, he had to protect Yin Tao, on the other hand, he had to deal with the guard of the other two kids who were also attacking him. What a scene!Seeing the two bigger kids\u2019 hands slapping in Yin Tao\u2019s face, Rong Yi immediately got steamed up, wishing that he could rush forward and slap them himself!\u201cWhat the fuck! Four bullying two! Aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dOf course, no matter how angry Rong Yi was, he could never really rush up to beat \u2019the kids. At this moment, the baby in his belly kicked him. He looked down and said grumpily, \u201cWhy are you kicking me? Huh? Go kick those who bully your big brother if you dare!\u201dIt was better for children to have a brother. If one of them was bullied, the other could help, just like Rong Yi and his second elder brother. Although he hated that he had always behaved like a woman, he would never allow anyone to bully him. People who had ever done this were beaten severely by him. If it hadn\u2019t been for that he had already transmigrated here, he would have definitely crippled the guy who dumped his second elder brother.Although the quins were very naughty, as long as any one of them got bullied, they would all work together to beat the one who bullied them back.But if the kid in his stomach had to teach those who were bullying his big brother, didn\u2019t it mean that he had to spread his leg and gave birth to it???!!!On thinking that day would come, Rong Yi had a spur to kill himself, and then thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019d better have an abortion.\u201dLike the baby inside knew his thoughts, he threw another few kicks immediately.Yin Jinye couldn\u2019t help laughing seeing him vent his anger on his unborn child.Rong Yi looked back and glared at Yin Jinye, \u201cYour son is being bullied, and you are still in the mood to laugh?!\u201dYin Jinye picked his eyebrows and looked at Yin Tao\u2019s direction, eyes slightly narrowed. All of a sudden, a strong force pressed against the kids, and then the kids who were bullying Yin Tao had a stinging pain in the head. They both staggered and then pushed each other onto the ground.Seeing this, their guard rushed over and held them up. \u201cAre you all right, little young master?\u201dThe two kids felt the great pains, and burst out crying.Those kids who were passing by all laughed at them, \u201cYou\u2019re still crying at this age? Shame, shame, shame!\u201dRong Yi then held his hand over Yin Jinye\u2019s shoulder and laughed, \u201cGood job! A man who dares to bully the kids is the real hero.\u201dYin Jinye gave him a leer and did not say a word.Yin Tao\u2019s guard kicked the other two kids\u2019 guards and took Yin Tao to Rong Yi\u2018s side.Seeing his daddy and father, Yin Tao ran over excitedly and held Rong Yi\u2019s thigh, \u201cDaddy, daddy, you are here.\u201dRong Yi shook his legs, \u201cDon\u2019t you see your father is also here?\u201dYin Tao turned around and called, \u201cFather.\u201dYin Jinye did not respond to him.Rong Yi added, \u201cLet your father hold you and we will go home.\u201dYin Tao immediately pounced on Yin Jinye, \u201cFather, hold me.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is just a kid, he can\u2019t walk fast. Just hold him and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d said Rong Yi.He just hoped the father and son could bond by doing so.Yin Jinye then looked over to the guard.The guard pretended not to see his eyes and turned to the wheeler and said, \u201cWhere is the carriage parked? Let\u2019s get the carriage to the school gate.\u201dThe wheeler nodded while smiling, \u201cOK.\u201dRong Yi then urged Yin Jinye, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. Hurry! Hold him! Let\u2019s go home and have dinner.\u201dYin Jinye looked down at the little face full of expectation, and directly picked up the boy and held him in his arms.Yin Tao kissed him on the face happily, then leaned in front of Rong Yi and also kissed his face. Since he went to school, this was the first time that his father and daddy came together to pick him up, so he was very happy.\u201cI only taught you how to kiss someone\u2019s face once, now you can use it so skillfully?\u201d Rong Yi held the boy\u2019s chin with a mixed feeling of anger and care \u201cDid it hurt when they beat you just now?\u201dYin Tao giggled, \u201cNo.\u201dRong Yi then sulked, \u201cYou even have fingerprints on your face, and you are still so happy? What a silly boy!\u201d\u201cDad is a big boy.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes and couldn\u2019t help squeezing his little face, \u201cIf they ever bully you again\u2026\u201dThen he stopped speaking. Originally, he wanted to question Yin Tao why he did not fight back and kick their asses, but on a second thought, they were only some kids. He didn\u2019t want him to become so violent at such a young age. Moreover, using \u00a0force could not solve any problem. On the contrary, it would make other children afraid of Yin Tao and stay away from him.So he tried to switch another topic, \u201cWhat is the name of the senior brothers who bullied you?\u201d\u201cOne is called Jia Shaochong and the other is called Xiao Diandian.\u201d\u201cDo you like going to school?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dRong Yi then frowned, \u201cTell me, why don\u2019t you like going to school?\u201d\u201cThose senior brothers all don\u2019t play with me.\u201d\u201cWhat if the seniors all play with you? Would you like going to school then?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Yin Tao liked hanging out with his senior brothers very much. When he first came to school, they all had a very good time. But then no one knew why everyone alienated him.\u201cYou\u2019re just kids.\u201d Rong Yi rubbed his little head and wondered what to do to make Yin Tao and his senior brothers get along well with each other. If it were his second brother, what would he do?Right, he remembered that something similar happened once. His sixth younger brother had a fight with a friend, and his second brother took a lot of pains to make them make up.Rong Yi, thinking about the kid\u2019s issue, unknowingly walked out of the school gate already.Suddenly, a few black shadows flew over their heads. Yin Tao lifted up into the sky with admiration. After getting into the carriage, he still did not forget to lie prone at the window and looked out.Rong Yi asked curiously, \u201cLittle Cherry, what are you looking at?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he leaned back to the window, and pointed to the sky and said, \u201cDaddy, I want to sit on that thing, too.\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to sit?\u201d Rong Yi sat down beside him and looked up into the sky along his line of sight. A group of cultivators flew over their heads, and several couples stood side by side on their swords. The male cultivator held the female cultivator by the waist, while those female cultivators held two or three-year-old children in their hands, or with eight or nine-year-old children standing in front of them. At a glance, one could tell that they were families.Children liked to play. When they saw other children flying faster than themselves, they would be anxious to let their fathers catch up with others, so flying by sword became a chasing game between those kids.Rong Yi asked Yin Tao, \u201cYou want to do that?\u201dYin Tao nodded happily, \u201cI want to fly with daddy and father by the sword.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe had only refined his Qi to the first level and would not be able to fly by the sword until the Base Practicing period.However, the fact that he could not do it did not mean that Yin Jinye could not, either.So Rong Yi turned his head to look at Yin Jinye, who was reading again.Yin Jinye felt the expecting sights focusing on him and could not help raising his own eyes. He saw two similar faces, a big one and a small one, looking at him with big sparkling eyes.Rong Yi took his book, \u201cDaddy, we want to fly by the sword.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe found that this guy would do whatever he thought of.Yin Tao threw himself into Yin Jinye\u2019s arms, \u201cFather, let\u2019s go home by the sword.\u201dYin Jinye said softly, \u201cI never fly by the sword.\u201dRong Yi asked curiously, \u201cDon\u2019t you? Then how would you hurry on with your journey?\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t reply and took back the book to continue reading.Rong Yi asked again, \u201cDo you have any spiritual runes for flying to let the carriage fly?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Yin Jinye never used low-level spiritual runes.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you even have this? It won\u2019t take you much space if you put it in your Storage Ring.\u201dThe guard, who was sitting outside, heard their words and said, \u201cYoung master, I have them if you like.\u201d\u201cStick ten flying runes on the carriage now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The guard pasted six on the carriage first, then four on the horses, and then drove the runes to let the carriage fly.\u201cIt\u2019s flying! It\u2019s flying!\u201d Yin Tao jumped around happily in the carriage.Rong Yi pointed to the group of cultivators flying by the sword in front, \u201cCatch up with them.\u201dYin Tao followed his dad and cried, \u201cCatch up with them, catch up with them.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026\u201d Outside came the voice of the guard who was embarrassed, \u201cYoung master, my cultivation is not as good as theirs and I\u2019m afraid I cannot catch up with them.\u201dRong Yi turned to Yin Jinye, \u201cDaddy, infuse the runes with your spiritual power.\u201dYin Tao followed him again, \u201cDaddy, infuse the runes with your spiritual power.\u201dRong Yi could not help laughing, \u201cDid you call him \u2018daddy\u2019(the kid imitates Rong Yi to call Yin Jinye daddy. As the way Rong Yi calls Yin Jinye daddy means another thing-their kids\u2019 daddy, so this in here is actually a very funny thing when Yin Tao also calls him daddy.\u201d? Call him father.\u201d\u201cFather, infuse the spiritual power.\u201d\u201cBe quick, come on, they are getting father away.\u201d\u201cHurry! Come on! Be quick, father, be quick. Be quick!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Being disturbed, Yin Jinye couldn\u2019t concentrate on his reading at all. He slapped his hand on the wall of the carriage and infused it with spiritual power, \u201cIf you make any more noise, I\u2019m gonna throw you down.\u201d said him coldly.The next moment, Rong Yi and Yin Tao felt the carriage sped up obviously.\u201cWow,\u201d cried Yin Tao excitedly, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s flying fast. The carriage is flying fast.\u201dWhen Rong Yi saw that they were catching up with those cultivators, he immediately asked Yin Tao to say hello to the children of those cultivators who flew in the headmost, \u201cSay hello to the big brother.\u201dHis tone was a little provocative and met with the cold shoulder of the male cultivators immediately.\u201cHi, big brother.\u201d Yin Tao said obediently.Seeing the carriage flying faster than them, the child who had always been the number one shouted, \u201cDad, pass them.\u201dThe male cultivator quickened his pace, but he could not beat the carriage.\u201cDad, hurry up.\u201d The boy urged his father, eyes turning red.Yin Tao chuckled, \u201cCan\u2019t catch up, can\u2019t catch up.\u201dThat boy sulked, \u201cMy dad is the best. We can catch up with you.\u201d\u201cMy father is even better.\u201dRong Yi smilingly said to Yin Tao, \u201cSon, now do you know how important it is to have a good father?\u201dYin Tao didn\u2019t fully understand but still nodded.Rong Yi smiled and said to the partner of the male cultivator, \u201cSimilarly, it is also important to have a strong partner.\u201dThe male cultivator\u2019s partner, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe male cultivator fumed, \u201cWhat the fuck do you mean?\u201dHow could Rong Yi say such a thing in front of his partner? Wasn\u2019t it obvious saying he was incompetent?\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth, what else can I mean?\u201d\u201cTell me your name if you have the guts.\u201dRong Yi smiled and answered, \u201cI am Yin Jinye.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe vaguely felt that his future would be very unsmooth.Both Yin Tao\u2019s guard and the wheeler were speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi was barely making enemies for their master.\u201cYin Jinye, I\u2019ll remember your name,\u201d said the male cultivator fiercely.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dYin Tao chuckled and shouted too, \u201cI am Yin Tao.\u201dThe boy of the male cultivator also said, \u201cYin Tao, I\u2019ll remember your name, too.\u201dRong Yi hurriedly put down the curtain and held Yin Tao\u2019s little face, \u201cSon, how could you give your real name to them?\u201dYin Tao looked at him with a confused face.Rong Yi knew at a glance that he did not understand, \u201cIn a word, when someone asks you your name, you should always give someone else\u2019s name. For example, if you hate someone, you can give the man\u2019s name to add more enemies for him. In this way, his enemies will help you solve this man without your own effort.\u201dThe guard and wheeler, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat a great trick!Yin Tao nodded happily.\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201dSuddenly, a chilly voice came, \u201cSo you mean you hate me?\u201dRong Yi smiled and turned to him, \u201cDaddy, how could you think like that? You are my love, how can I hate you? The reason why I said your name is that I think you are powerful enough and the other party is not your opponent, and you can deal with them as simple as pinching ants. You are not afraid of one or tens of thousands of such weak enemies.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dWas this a compliment?\u201cBesides, it\u2019s just a name, he doesn\u2019t know where you live, how can he find you? Isn\u2019t that right, Little Cherry?\u201dYin Tao nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dYin Jinye glanced at the child who was always echoing Rong Yi to speak and then continued to read.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter they returned to the Yin Mansion for lunch, Rong Yi borrowed from Yin Tao the smelting furnace, aluminums, and irons.Rong Su looked at the smelting furnace and asked, \u201cYoung master, didn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t know how to refine magic weapons?\u201dRong Yi said, \u201cLeave me alone and get out of here. Don\u2019t disturb me.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Rong Su closed the door.Rong Yi added from inside, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t peep again.\u201dRong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dWell, that\u2019s impossible for them.This time, instead of poking at the window, everyone climbed onto the roof, removed the tiles and peeped down from above.Rong Yi looked at these steels and irons and sighed again, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to use the smelting furnace one day in my life, and to use this for a child.\u201dSince he had transmigrated into this place, he seemed to be getting further and further away from hating kids.Rong Yi\u2019s mind was tangled up, \u201cShould I do it or not?\u201dLei Sai, who was hiding on the roof and peeking at him, was so anxious that he even wanted to rush down and strangle him, shouting, \u201cJust do it now!\u201dRong Yi hesitated for a long time and finally threw the ingredients into the furnace. This was the first time for him to refine magic weapons for years, but he had not lost his refining skills.On the roof, Lei Sai really could not figure out what Rong Yi wanted to do, maybe refining magic weapons or maybe not, because he had never seen someone who only used one kind of ingredients to refine magic weapons. But, from the perspective of Rong Yi\u2019s look, he seemed to be very serious.However, Rong Yi had one thing that Lei Sai was jealous of very much, that was, Rong Yi actually had both mutant spiritual root of thunder and fire. These were the best roots for refining magic weapons, spiritual elixirs and spiritual equipment. They could help the forgers not only melt many hard materials, but also produce better quality magic weapons than other forgers.After Rong Yi melted those iron and steel, he used spiritual power to control the shape of the ingredients and slowly created the pattern in his mind. Because it was the first time for him to make something, it took him a lot of time and effort to control the shape of the object.And now it was already late at night.Xing He had originally wanted to hear how Rong Yi used low-grade ingredients to make a holy magic weapon. But after waiting for a long time, Rong Yi still didn\u2019t come out for dinner, so he dismissed the idea and continued to peep on him on the roof.Rong Yi didn\u2019t stop smelting until the next morning. Looking at the gadgets on the ground and on the table, he breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cI make it, damn, it\u2019s too waste of my time. I swear I will never do this again.\u201dHe looked at the sky outside and saw that it was already bright. So he shouted to the outside, \u201cA Su.\u201dThe next moment, Rong Su already appeared in front of him.Rong Yi raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhy did you come so fast? Were you peeking on me outside?\u201dRong replied quickly, \u201cNo.\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t have time to check whether he was peeking or not. He asked, \u201cIs my Little Cherry awake? Bring him to me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Rong Su left the room to pick up Yin Tao.After half a column of incense\u2019s time (about 15 minutes), Yin Tao ran to Rong Yi\u2019s room, \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m here.\u201dRong Yi squatted down in front of Yin Tao and pointed to the object he had refined last night, \u201cThis is the toy I made for you\u2026\u201d\u201cA toy\u2026\u201d There were strange cries above from the roof.Rong Yi looked up angrily and said without astonishment, \u201cI knew you guys would peek on me.\u201dLei Sai and Xinghe then jumped down from the roof, \u201cSo you have a whole night\u2019s time only to make a toy?\u201dThey had never seen anyone making toys from a smelting furnace. It was put fine timber to petty use!Rong Yi gave him a stare, \u201cI am only at the first level of Qi practicing. Do you think I have the ability to make a magic weapon?\u201dLei Sai and Xinghe, \u201c\u2026\u201dRecently, too many unexpected things happened on Rong Yi, making everyone forget the fact that Rong Yi\u2019s cultivation was far from qualified.Rong Yi continued to talk to Yin Tao, \u201cThis is a little tricycle.\u201dHe lifted the child and put him on it, then let the child\u2019s little foot step on the pedals, \u201cPress your right foot forward. After your right foot goes down, your left foot will come up. Keep stepping on your left foot, and you will see the tricycle move.\u201dIt was simple. Yin Tao grasped the tips quickly. He excitedly rode around the table several times, \u201cIt\u2019s funny. I like it.\u201d\u201cThere are a few more tricycles here. Put them away in your Storage Ring. When you go to school, you will step on it to the classroom. If there is a senior brother who wants to play with your tricycle, take out another one and share it with them, you know?\u201dYin Tao nodded with joy.\u201cBut remember one thing. You can not lend them to your senior brothers Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian.\u201d Rong Yi then pointed to the items on the table, \u201cAnd, this is a pistol that can shoot water.\u201dHe poured the tea into the pistol and then taught Yin Tao how to play, \u201cThis toy can only be taken out after the senior brothers are willing to play with you. You can have a water fight and shoot on each other with it. What I have made is just some ordinary toys and will not hurt people.\u201dRong Yi was afraid that the child could not remember it, so he explained it to Yin Tao\u2019s guard once again.Yin Tao got some interesting new toys and took the guard to school without even eating breakfast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those curious kids all surrounded Yin Tao and watched his riding, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you can actually walk on your own without being pulled by a human or evil beast. Is it driven by spiritual force?\u201d\u201cIdiot, if there is spiritual force\u2019s drive, do you still need to step on it with your feet?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dA child asked Yin Tao, \u201cLittle younger brother, what is this thing you are riding?\u201dYin Tao replied happily, \u201cA tricycle my dad had refined for me.\u201d\u201cTricycle?\u201d The children present looked at each other, saying that they had never heard of such a thing.Yin Tao stepped on his tricycle to speed up and came to the vicinity of the classroom. When the children around him saw his toy, they all stopped playing and looked at him.\u201cWhat toy is he playing with? It looks fun. I also want to play with it.\u201d\u201cI want it, too.\u201d As soon as these children saw something fun to play with, their eyes were beaming and they leaned towards Yin Tao one after another.One guard of Yin Tao\u2019s senior classmate stopped his little young master, \u201cLittle young master, he is a freak born from the belly of a man. You cannot play with him. We\u2019ve agreed on that, haven\u2019t we? You can play with other disciples if you want. You can play other fun games together.\u201dThe other guards echoed, \u201cYes, you can play other little games.\u201dAt this time, Yin Tao took out another tricycle for his elder brothers and sisters from other classes.Those kids took turns riding the tricycle and had a great time. Seeing this, the children in the same class with Yin Tao were both anxious and thirsty for it. They pushed aside the guards and ran over, \u201cBrother Yin, Brother Yin\u2026\u201dAfter all, these children\u2019s guards were servants. They had no right to prevent their little young masters from making friends with anyone. Feeling hard to stop their young masters, they could only stand by and watch them play, wearing a gloomy face.Seeing those children all circling around Yin Tao, Yin Tao\u2019s guard Su Gu smiled. Young master\u2019s trick really worked, the little young master instantly gained popularity, thought him.Yin Tao kept Rong Yi\u2019s words in mind and took out the remaining tricycles for his senior brothers who were willing to make friends with him.Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian, who arrived late with their guards, were stunned seeing the lively garden. When they saw the other disciples having a wonderful time riding strange things, the two kids immediately ran over and asked, \u201cSenior brothers, senior brothers, what are you riding?\u201d\u201cTricycle, younger brother Yin lent is to us.\u201dJia Shaochong\u2019s guard asked, \u201cWhich younger brother Yin?\u201d\u201cYou know him. Yin Tao.\u201d After finishing speaking, the child shouted at Yin Tao, who was in the crowd, \u201cJunior Yin, come chase me.\u201dYin Tao replied, \u201cAll right, senior brothers, let\u2019s go after him.\u201d\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d Other children rode tricycles to chase them.Jia Shaochong and Xiao Xiaodian felt particularly uncomfortable to see this scene. They should be the children\u2019s king among those disciples. Every time they appeared, everyone would come to surround them to play. This time, everyone ran to Yin Tao, making them very unhappy.\u201cHum, it\u2019s just a gadget. What\u2019s so fun?\u201d Jia Shaochong pretended not to care but couldn\u2019t move his eyes away from the tricycle at all.Xiao Diandian, seeing that everyone was having such a good time, pulled Jia\u2019s sleeve and whispered, \u201cIt looks pretty fun.\u201dJia Shaochong, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe guards of the two walked up to the guards of the other children and asked in a low voice, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wouldn\u2019t let your little young masters approach Yin Tao?

They couldn\u2019t stand the temptation and ran to play with him. What we said to them became nonsense.\u201dXiao Diandian\u2019s guard, \u201c\u2026\u201dJia Shaochong\u2019s guard, \u201c\u2026\u201dSeeing the other disciples playing so happily, Xiao Diandian also wanted to ride the tricycle that he had never seen before, \u201cSenior brother Shaochong, I want to ride the tricycle.\u201dJia Shaochong replied honestly, \u201cMe too.\u201dWhen they saw other disciples riding it in turns for a while, they could no longer help but walk over to cut the line and get on other\u2019s tricycle.Song Ningzhen, who was supposed to take the turn, angrily pushed Jia Shaochong, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, go away, go away!\u201dJia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian just ignored him. One rode the tricycle while the other was responsible for pushing it forward from behind.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s so funny. I like it.\u201d Jia Shaochong laughed happily.Xiao Diandian, who was busy with the pushing, shouted, \u201cBrother Jia, it\u2019s my turn to play later.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dYin Tao saw that they robbed the tricycle and immediately came to stop them with other disciples on the tricycle, \u201cMy dad said that you cannot play with it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d Jia Shaochong turned the tricycle around, but it could not move, \u201cAh, why not move? Brother Xiao, push harder.\u201dXiao Diandian used all the strength he had, \u201cBrother Jia, I can\u2019t push it.\u201dJia Shaochong looked down at the wheels, \u201cIs it broken?\u201dIn fact, Rong Yi had expected that the two kids would do this so he put a rune on it. As long as someone chanted the spell, he could immediately make it stop moving.So Su Gu enchanted the spell when he saw them robbing the tricycle, and then walked over to carry Jia Shaochong down and let Song Ningzhen ride on it.Seeing this, Jia Shaochong\u2019s guard quickly came to his little young master\u2019s side, \u201cAre you all right, young master?\u201dJia Shaochong shouted, \u201cI want to ride the tricycle, I want to ride the tricycle.\u201dHis guard was very embarrassed. After all, this toy was someone else\u2019s, it was not appropriate for him to take it away in the faces of so many people. What\u2019s more, the toy belonged to Yin Tao, he didn\u2019t want his little young master to ride on Yin Tao\u2019s tricycle.Xiao Diandian also clamored for the tricycle in front of his guard, \u201cI want to ride on it, too, I want to ride on it, too.\u201dHearing his little young master\u2019s words, Xiao Diandian\u2019s guard immediately went to lift up Song Ningzhen who was on the tricycle.Song Ningzhen, who was just about to step on the pedal, was stunned. Seeing that he himself was one meter above the ground, he shouted with a loud cry on the spot.Song Ningzhen\u2019s guard shouted angrily at Xiao Diandian\u2019s, \u201cXiao Zhi, what do you want, let go of my little young master.\u201dXiao Zhi said, \u201cLet my little young master ride first and then we will give it to your little young master.\u201d\u201cHum, interesting, my little young master has queued for such a long time and finally it is his turn, why should your little young master be the first? How could he act like a tyranny?\u201d Song Ningzhen\u2019s guard glared at Xiao Zhi, then held Song Ningzhen and put him back on the tricycle. He wiped his little young master\u2019s tears lovingly, \u201cLittle young master, stop crying, let\u2019s ride.\u201d\u201cThe tricycle is mine.\u201d Jia Shaochong rushed over to push Song Ningzhen.Song Ningzhen\u2019s guard raised his hand and pushed Jia Shaochong aside impatiently, \u201cIf you want to ride on it, line up yourself. I won\u2019t show mercy if you do it again.\u201dJia Shaochong staggered and then fell to the ground unsteadily and his eyes turned red when he saw the tricycle being ridden away. He cried to his guard, \u201cJia Shi, I want the tricycle. Help me get it back.\u201dXiao Diandian also cried, \u201cGet it back, get it back.\u201dXiao Zhi and Jia Shi took a look at each other, thinking whether they should grab it or not.Song Ningzhen quickly rode it away. His guard snorted to Xiao Zhi, \u201cI\u2019ll see who dares to rob my little young master\u2019s tricycle.\u201dThe other five guards who had befriended Song Ningzhen\u2019s guard also came to help.Xiao zhi, \u201c\u2026\u201dJia Shi, \u201c\u2026\u201dTwo VS six, they had no chance of winning.Su Gu saw the confrontation on both sides and curved up his lips. His master arranged this to let Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian\u2019s guards have a feud with the others, thought him.At this moment, the school bell rang.Hearing the bell, the children riding tricycles obediently returned it to Yin Tao and ran into the classroom.Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian, afraid of being punished by the teacher, stop crying and also ran into the classroom.Xiao Zhi and Jia Shi both felt relieved.The risk was finally over, otherwise, they really did not know how to deal with so many guards, however, from now on, their relationship with the other guards also changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the children sat on their own seats and did not speak, he still clearly felt that they were much closer to the boy.On the contrary, Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian, the two children\u2019s king, were alienated by the other children and separated from their seats. Even their guards were snubbed. The other guards didn\u2019t stand with them and instead ran to talk quietly with Su Gu, who had always stood alone in the corner. Moreover, there was an ingratiating look on their faces and they seemed to want to establish a close relationship with Su Gu.Jin Tong\u2019s brows knitted. What on earth had happened since yesterday and why such an earth-shaking change took place?He suppressed his doubts and planned to ask Jia Shi for the reason in an hour\u2019s rest time, but before he could ask someone to find out why, the bell for the rest time rang, and the children immediately gathered around Yin Tao. Even the children next door also rushed to their classroom, and now the room was soon full of kids. What a lively scene!Then, Yin Tao took out a pile of toys these children had never seen before to let them play. He also took out seven toys that looked like magic weapons but actually were not magic weapons and filled them with water to have a water fight.In the garden was full of children\u2019s laughter, and their love for Yin Tao rose to a higher level.When Jin Tong saw this scene, he understood in a minute why Yin Tao suddenly became so popular. In an instant, his facial expression sank. He originally wanted to isolate Yin Tao through the exclusion from these children and made Yin Tao hate coming to the school to study refining magic weapons. Then he secretly used some means to prevent him from being a pro-disciple of Immortal Yunyi. But now he was farther and farther away from what he had thought. No, he could not stay idle and do nothing. He should be the Immortal Yunyi\u2019s (Immortal Yun is also Taoist Yun, just different from different mouths. So please don\u2019t get confused.) inner disciple.He sullenly stared at Yin Tao who smiled with great brilliance for a moment and then turned around and walked to the dean\u2019s study.Today was the happiest day since Yin Tao came to the school. When he returned to the Yin Mansion, he immediately cried happily, \u201cDaddy, daddy, daddy\u2026\u201dHe wanted to tell his daddy about what had happened in school today.Wen Chuan welcomed him with a smile, \u201cLittle master, to make your toys, young master did not rest all night. Now he is still asleep in his room, so it is better for you not to disturb him.\u201dSeeing Yin Tao\u2019s disappointment on his face, he hurriedly added, \u201cBut the young master has said that if you have got something, you can talk to your father first, he is reading in the room and is very free to listen to you.\u201dYin Tao\u2019s eyes grew bright and he giggled as he rode his tricycle to the backyard. He shouted happily, \u201cFather, father, I\u2019m home\u2026\u201dHearing the cry, Yin Jinye raised his eyebrows.Yin Tao rode his tricycle to Yin Jinye\u2019s room. Seeing his father sitting on the reclining chair, he laughed and rode to his side, patting the front of the tricycle and saying, \u201cThis is a toy made by my daddy last night. It\u2019s called tricycle. I rode it to school this morning. Those senior brothers all scrambled to play. They all said it was fun and praised my daddy for being good at making toys\u2026\u201dYin Jinye glanced at the tricycle, then withdrew his eyes and continued reading.\u201cThose who ignored me before all came to play with me, we also had a tricycle race to see who rode the fastest. I won. Father, does it mean I am better than them? And then we also had a water gun fight. I\u2019m really happy\u2026\u201d Yin Tao was in a good mood so he didn\u2019t care whether his father was listening to him or not. He rode his tricycle in the room. At the same time, his mouth kept saying, \u201cThose senior brothers also said that they would come to our house for a visit. Father, we have to prepare a lot of delicious food to entertain them. They said that they like sweet cakes, and I also like it. Father, will you prepare them?\u201dYin Jinye\u2019s eyebrows tightened. This kid was really a chatterboxAfter an hour, Yin Tao was still talking. He had talked about what had happened in the school and what others had said once again, \u201cFather, my classmates say they will go out with their parents and travel to other big cities when they are off school. Father, I also want to travel with you and daddy.\u201dHis incessant chatter made Yin Jinye unable to focus on his reading, so he folded up his book and asked, \u201cWhere is your daddy?\u201d\u201cDaddy is sleeping in his room.\u201d Yin Tao lay down on his lap and whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s low down our voice and don\u2019t disturb him.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dHum, Rong Yi must have lied that he was sleeping, because he knew Yin Tao would keep chattering after he came back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYin Jinye guessed absolutely right. Right now in the opposite room, Rong Yi was lying in bed, tittering. In the past in his world, his five younger brothers and sister would twitter around his second brother after coming home from school, telling everything that happened in the school, talking from the dining table to the bathroom, and not closing their mouths until \u00a0time to go to bed.At that time, he felt that his brothers and sister were really noisy and bothering, so he also wanted Yin Jinye to taste what it felt like to hear all the chatter in his ears.However, Yin Jinye felt very interesting hearing Yin Tao talking happily now. His mood was flying with the child\u2019s tone, and a big smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.Rong Yi knew that Yin Tao had a good time in school today, so he was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, close his eyes and sleep while practicing to improve his cultivation.Everyone knew that he was cultivating, so they did not disturb him. Rong Yi slept for two days and didn\u2019t wake up until the early morning of the third day.On that day\u2019s morning, Rong Yi ate breakfast alone after Yin Tao went to school. Just as he was looking for something to do, the guard at the gate came in, \u201cYoung master, Immortal Yunyi is here.\u201d\u201cImmortal Yunyi? The master of my Little Cherry?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cYes.\u201dRong Yi pouted his lips. The man came at the right time!Rong Yi immediately asked the guard to invite the guest in, and asked the servants to clean up the table. Then he got up and went out to welcome Immortal Yunyi.Seeing Rong Yi who was heavily pregnant, Immortal Yunyi quickly stepped forward to support him, \u201cYou are pregnant. Don\u2019t come out since it is not convenient, lest you accidentally hurt yourself and the baby. By the way, this is the fetus-nourishing pill my junior sister has specially refined for you. She said, after taking the pill she has refined, the fetus in your womb will come to the world safely and surely. You will definitely not hurt yourself and your baby even if you fight with others for a half month. Even if someone secretly feeds you aborticide, it will not result any bad effect or hurt the baby a little bit.\u201dBefore Rong Yi could react, Rong Su already took the pill and slipped it into the Storage Ring, \u201cThank you, Immortal Yunyi. Thank you so much.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at Rong Su, \u201cThis is for me, why do you look so excited?\u201dRong Su replied quickly, \u201cWith the pill, we don\u2019t have to worry about you will have an abortion ever again.\u201dRong Yi sulked, \u201cFuck off!\u201dImmortal Yunyi was a bit confused, \u201cWhy do you want to have an abortion? No, you can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m still waiting for you to have another magic weapon refining talent.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dWell, this was the original intention of him sending the fetus-nourishing pill?!Immortal Yunyi sat down and took a sip of tea. Then he smiled, \u201cBy the way, did the evil beast\u2019s \u00a0milk I sent to you last time work? Have you let Little Cherry eat enough?\u201dAs he mentioned this, Rong Yi immediately flared up, \u201cWhat makes you think men should grow milk?\u201dImmortal Yunyi froze and said, \u201cNo? But you even gave birth to a child, how can you grow no milk?\u201dRong Yi really didn\u2019t have the energy to talk so much with him. So he got straight to the point, \u201cI was wondering your real intention coming here today.\u201dHearing this question, Immortal Yunyi hurriedly blurted out, \u201cI came to you today just wanting to talk about the enchantment stuff. Since you showed me the power of enchantment last time, I have let the disciples with thunder and fire spiritual roots try it over a hundred times. Only with your rune, they managed to enchant successfully, but the power they generated was barely satisfactory. So I want to ask, do you have any special rune spell and method to enchant successfully?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dImmortal Yunyi said hurriedly, \u201cSo, I mean\u2026can you\u2026you know\u2026\u201dRong Yi knew that he wanted him to pass on these things to others and immediately refused, \u201cNo.\u201dBefore his coming, Immortal Yunyi had anticipated Rong Yi would refuse. If it were him, he wouldn\u2019t pass on his unique secret technique to others, either, let alone the big secret technique that could arouse a big wave of the whole cultivation world.However, he did not want to give up like this, \u201cAren\u2019t you planning to take some disciples?\u201dRong Yi shook his head, \u201cNever thought about it. I think it\u2019s very troublesome to have disciples. Besides, I don\u2019t have enough time for teaching them this and that like others do.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to teach, as long as you let them be around you, as for how much they can learn from you is their ability. Besides, isn\u2019t it good to have a few more servants to serve you? They can offer you foot-washing water and protect you.\u201dRong Yi pointed to a large group of servants in the living room and hissed, \u201cDon\u2019t think there is no one washing my feet? I am no lack of people protecting me, either. Of course, if that person is better than my cultivation mate, maybe I will consider it.\u201dImmortal Yun Yi asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your cultivation mate\u2019s level?\u201dRong Yi struck dumb by this question, but he knew that Yin Jinye\u2019s cultivation could be no worse than those at the Immortal Refining level at least.He looked at the servants in the living room and wanted to ask them about Yin Jinye\u2019s cultivation level, but they all looked down busy with their own stuff as if they didn\u2019t see him at all.Worried that Rong Yi would turn him down again, Immortal Yunyi brazened out to ask, \u201cThe man who is gonna learn from you is not bad at cultivation. He can definitely protect you well. That\u2019s settled. Let him stay with you for the time being.\u201dRong Yi, \u201cWho told you\u2026\u201dImmortal Yunyi quickly changed the subject, \u201cApart from enchanting thing, I also want to talk about Little Cherry.\u201d\u201cWhat is wrong with my son again?\u201d\u201cI want to accept him as my pro-disciple and take him to Nine Void Sect to learn to refine magic weapons.\u201dRong Yi frowned. Hearing this, he was a little reluctant to send Yin Tao away. If it had been before he had transmigrated here, he wished that he could have stayed from the child, the farther the better.He shook his head, \u201cHe is too young to take care of himself. If he is bullied, we wouldn\u2019t even get noticed, let alone protect him.\u201d\u201cWho dares to bully him when I am around?\u201d said Yunyi with a cold snort.\u201cYes, no one would dare to do this to him when you are around. But you would not stay with him all the time. For example, if he wants to go to the toilet, would you follow? If he takes a bath, will you help him? If he wants to sleep, will you accompany him? What if you can\u2019t walk away from refining magic weapon when he needs you?\u201d\u201cEveryone knows that he is the disciple of mine. Even if I am not around, no one dares to bully him.\u201dRong Yi laughed scornfully, \u201cReally? Then please follow me for a trip.\u201d\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you get there. Well, before you go, please put a shapeshifting rune on you first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Immortal Yunyi immediately turned into a grey-haired old woman after putting it on.Rong Yi took the disguised Immortal Yunyi to Haishan Academy in a carriage.Seeing the plaque on the school gate, Immortal Yunyi said in surprise, \u201cLittle Cherry\u2019s daddy, isn\u2019t this Haishan Academy? What do you want to bring me here?\u201dRong Yi stroked his big belly softly and said banteringly, \u201cI just want to let you see if my son is as good as he is in his family under the protection of Immortal Yunyi here in school.\u201dThings could not be that simple, thought Immortal Yunyi.He took out the identity token of the school and the guards immediately let them in.Immortal Yunyi held Rong Yi into the campus.Since Rongyi was pregnant, both of them walked very slowly.While admiring the scenery of the campus, Immortal Yunyi said, \u201cI used to come and go in a hurry. I\u2019ve never slowed down to watch the scenery here like now. If you look carefully, the fengshui and environmental layout of the campus are quite good. It has the style of the Nine Void Sect. By the way, I heard that Little Cherry\u2019s father is also a disciple of the Sect. While your father is Rong Weiyi, the lord of the Tianxu Peak. In this way, you are my disciple\u2019s disciple\u2019s disciple, and you should call me grand grandmaster.\u201dRong Yi peered at him and said nothing.\u201cHey! Little Cherry\u2019s daddy! Give me some response!\u201d Immortal Yunyi wanted to use this relationship to cotton up with Rong Yi and let Rong Yi teach the people he wanted to introduce to learn the enchantment. He didn\u2019t expect Rong Yi to ignore his words, making him both anxious and depressed. Throughout the whole Zhonghai Prefecture, there were piles of people who wanted to curry favor with him, or want to get associated with him, so that he could help them make magic weapons, but Rong Yi seemed not to want this grandmaster at all.Rong Yi asked back, \u201cYou said you were my grand grandmaster, should I call my son grandmaster then? However, my son calls me daddy. I am his daddy and you are his master shifu. You and I should be peers. In this way, my dad is one generation higher than you. How do you call my dad? But my father also called you grandmaster, then my son\u2026\u201d\u201cHold on, hold on\u2026\u201d Immortal Yunyi was stunned by his words, \u201cYou might as well call me Immortal Yunyi.\u201dRong Yi smiled seeing him rubbing his temple in a painful look. He pointed to the courtyard in front of them and said, \u201cHere we are.\u201dThe two men walked before the courtyard gate of Yin Tao\u2019s classroom, just in time for the break.Those kids rushed out and ran to Yin Tao\u2019s classroom like a swarm of bees.And then Yin Tao walked out of the classroom surrounded by a group of kids and took out a pile of toys to play with them.\u201cLittle Cherry is really popular among those kids.\u201d said Immortal Yunyi with a smile.Rong Yi snorted lightly. Immortal Yunyi didn\u2019t see the situation two days ago, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t say so.He took Immortal Yunyi to the rockery in the garden to watch them play.Immortal Yunyi asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you go talk to Little Cherry?\u201d\u201cI only came here to see if he is doing well.\u201d\u201cObviously, he is doing very well. The kids playing with him are very smart, knowing to be close to my disciple is fawning on me.\u201dRong Yi hissed and turned his eyes around the garden. He saw Jia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian standing in the corner with a pair of envious eyes watching Yin Tao and their senior brothers have a water fight. They seemed to want to rush over and play with Yin Tao but were stopped by their guards who tried to block their view.Seeing this scene, Rong Yi hummed softly, \u201cWell, every dog has his day.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Rong Yi looked away and started to look for Jin Tong.Seeing Rong Yi\u2019s eyes wandering in the garden, Immortal Yunyi asked him curiously, \u201cLittle Cherry\u2019s daddy, what are you looking for?\u201dHardly had his voice faded away, a group of school guards rushed in and shouted at these kids immersing in playing, \u201cAll disciples, stand still. Don\u2019t move. All the guards of the disciples, stand still.\u201dThe kids were so scared that none dared to move a bit when they saw the school guards\u2019 aggressive appearance.The head of the school guard\u2019s sight swept across the crowd coldly and he announced loudly, \u201cThe school stipulates that in order not to delay students\u2019 study and cultivation, students are not allowed to bring toys to play in school. Now we will confiscate all your toys, and students who bring the most toys to play in school must be punished as a warning to others.\u201dJia Shaochong and Xiao Diandian\u2019s guards immediately gloated. They jumped out and pointed at Yin Tao and said, \u201cChief guard, the one who has brought the most toys is him. He brought five tricycles and seven water guns. He also lured other kids to play with him, causing them to delay their cultivation. You should punish him severely so as not to let him mislead other kids.\u201dAmong all kids, Yin Tao brought the most toys indeed.Yin Tao cried with his eyes turning red instantly seeing that the toys his daddy had made for him were all taken away, \u201cThese are mine, give them back to me. Give them back!\u201dHiding in the dark, Immortal Yunyi and Rong Yi felt their hearts ache when they saw Yin Tao jump up trying to grab his toys in the guard\u2019s hands.\u201cThose sons of bitch, how dare they confiscated my disciple\u2019s toys!? I swear I am gonna destroy them!\u201dRong Yi added, \u201cYes, tear them apart limb from limb and hang them at the gate of the school to let others know how miserable the consequences of bullying Little Cherry could be.\u201dImmortal Yunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Gu hurried out and grabbed Yin Tao, \u201cChief guard, I remember there is no such regulations that forbid them bringing toys to school.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new regulation issued this morning. The dean asked us to implement it immediately,\u201d the chief guard said.The new regulation was issued after Yin Tao had brought the toys to play with other kids. Su Gu knew someone was behind it as soon as he heard the chief guard\u2019s words. He tried hard to suppress his anger and said, \u201cSince it is a new regulation, it should be announced to all disciples in advance and then implemented. It is not too late to punish them if they still violate it after they know the new rule.\u201d\u201cWe are following the dean\u2019s order. Are you trying to disobey him?\u201d The chief guard stared sternly at Su Gu, \u201cDo you know the consequences of disobeying his orders?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Of course, Su Gu knew disobeying orders would only incur punishment, and then the disobeyer might be expelled from the school, it was their losses, not the school.Hiding behind the rockery, Immortal Yunyi took offence hearing that his little disciple would be punished, \u201cWhere is Jin tong? Where is Jin Tong? How can he be absent after such a huge thing happens?\u201dRong Yi sneered, if he didn\u2019t guess wrong, it was Jin Tong who as behind this. How would he be here right now? The guy had gotten good luck, otherwise, he could have torn the mask off his face right in front of Immortal Yunyi.The chief guard shouted, \u201cPut the child down.\u201dSu Gu knew in his heart that if they were to dispose of his little young master, they would definitely beat him to death, or use some dirty means to destroy the boy, so he must not hand over his little young master to them.He quickly picked up the child and flew towards the school gate.Seeing this, the chief guard quickly ordered, \u201cCatch them.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d More than a dozen guards immediately chased up.Those guards of Yin Tao\u2019s senior brothers were also very anxious on seeing this. After two days together, they thought Su Gu was a very nice person since he did not care about their disrespect, exclusion and snubbing to him, but enthusiastically let their young masters ride the tricycles and play with water guns.A disciple\u2019s guard could not help but say, \u201cThe sudden seizure of toys must have aimed at Yin Tao.\u201dThe other guards also followed, \u201cHmm, he just brought toys to play in the campus, and a new regulation is issued against him. Someone must have been aiming at him.\u201d\u201cIf he being caught, the punishment that follows would be definitely not as simple as spanking.\u201d\u201cScumbags, he even targets at a child! Their senior brother is really son of bitch, he did this all because he has not been accepted as a pro-disciple, but it\u2019s not that he has been totally ignored after his master shifu has new disciples. Why is he aiming at a three-year-old child?\u201dThe guards around hurriedly hissed, \u201cAre you seeking for death? If he hears this, our little younger masters will be implicated and expelled from the school.\u201dIn a split second, everyone went silent.At that time, a cold voice sounded from the crowd behind, \u201cWhich senior brother?\u201dA guard subconsciously replied, \u201cIdiot, of course, it is senior brother Jin Tong.\u201dThe guard beside him hurriedly scolded, \u201cAre you nuts? How could you say the name of our senior brother?\u201d\u201cI, I, I heard someone ask behind, so I answered subconsciously.\u201d The guard turned to look back, but there was no one, only a pile of rockeries.Those who could serve as guards in the school usually reached 8th or 9th level of cultivation in Base Practicing, which was much superior to the disciples of the school. And Su Gu was only at 3rd level of Base Practicing, so he was no their match at all.He did not fly very far before getting captured by the school guards. Those guards pressed him on the ground and grabbed the kid from him.Jia Shi and Xiao Zhi laughed gloatingly as they saw Su Gu and Yin Tao captured.Su Gu struggled hard while saying anxiously, \u201cLet go of my little young master. If you hut him, my master will never let you go.\u201d\u201cLet me go, let me go.\u201d Yin Tao could not break free, he bowed his head and opened his mouth to bite the hand of the school guard.\u201cOuch, you damn kid, how dare you bite me!\u201d The school guard threw Yin Tao to the ground in anger, and at the same time took out a magic weapon similar to a ruler and used all the strength he had trying to beat Yin Tao.Su Gu\u2019s pupils shrank and he screamed, \u201cLittle young master, run.\u201dThe guards of the disciples could tell with a glance that the power of the magic weapon was absolutely beyond a child\u2019s ability to bear. They exclaimed in succession that if the weapon hit on the kid, the kid would be crippled even if not dead.On the verge of the magic weapon hitting on Yin Tao\u2019s body, suddenly, a white light flashed in a spit second and the school guard with the ruler was kicked away like a Cuju( this is noted before. It\u2019s a style of football in ancient China). With a \u201cbang\u201d, he severely hit the big tree trunk, spraying a mouthful of blood.The chief guard was frightened and shouted, \u201cWho? Who did not abide by the rules of the college?\u201dThen, a man in white appeared in front of Yin Tao and squatted down to pick up the boy.The chief guard shouted again, \u201cWho the hell are you? How dare you break into our Haishan Academy? Are you sick of living?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, her cold and dignified eyes discouraged them and frightened them a few steps back.Immortal Yunyi didn\u2019t expect them to have the guts to bully his little disciple behind his back, which made his promise that he had made to Rong Yi turn into a total joke.\u201cLittle Cherry, little Cherry, are you all right?\u201d Rong Yi walked out of the rockery with a big belly and came before Yin Tao.When Yin Tao saw his daddy, he finally couldn\u2019t hold it and cried out in fear, \u201cDaddy, Daddy\u2026\u201dSince Rong Yi had transmigrated into this world, every time he saw this kid, he was always giggling happily. This was the very first time he saw him crying so sadly and fearfully.He hugged the child heartily. After he examined the child\u2019s body and confirmed that there was only trauma, he comforted his boy, \u201cBe good, don\u2019t cry, no one dares to bully you in front of your daddy.\u201dFortunately, he brought Immortal Yunyi to Haishan Academy today to expose Jin Tong\u2019s true face. Otherwise, he would only wait at home for the body of his child or a handicapped son. He would never lift his head in front of others and his smile would never be as bright as now.Rong Yi was scared at the thought of it and he hugged the child tightly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d Su Gu was delighted to break away from the guards and quickly ran to Rong Yi\u2019s side.Rong Yi asked with concern, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Seeing Yin Tao who was crying so sad with tears all over his face, Su Gu reproached himself, \u201cI\u2019m useless. I failed to protect the little young master. Please punish me.\u201d\u201cSince you know you\u2019re not capable enough, cultivate hard after you go back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe chief guard shouted, \u201cWho are you? Why did you break into our school and stop us from carrying out our order?\u201dImmortal Yunyi snorted. Before he could speak, the school bell rang, \u201cRinging\u2026Ring\u2026\u201dThose immortals who came to give lectures came to the garden one after another. Jin Tong, who originally wanted to wait for the guards to solve Yin Tao\u2019s problem, had no choice but showed his appearance in front of the public.When he saw the guard with the ruler and magic weapon fell down and vomited blood, while Yin Tao was crying in Rong Yi\u2019s arms unharmed, Jin Tong\u2019s eyes flashed a touch of maliciousness. Why didn\u2019t this annoying child die or get handicapped at least?Rong Yi\u2019s eyes surged with fire seeing Jin Tong coming through the crowd. He said to Su Gu with a cold voice, \u201cWhich teacher teaches my little Cherry to refine magic weapon? Let him come out and uphold justice for my son.\u201dSu Gu frowned. The young master knew Yin Tao\u2019s teacher was Jin Tong. He also knew that Jing Tong had strong jealousy towards the little young master. Even the seizure of toys could be commanded by Jin Tong. Su Gu really did not understand why his young master named Jin Tong to uphold the justice, and how could Jing Tong uphold justice for the little young master?The guards of Yin Tao\u2019s senior brothers also felt that Rong Yi was making a fool of himself. Jin Tong wished that Yin Tao would die right now. How could he speak for Yin Tao?Su Gu saw Rong Yi staring at Jin Tong coldly with sharp eyes. He guessed that Rong Yi would not really want Jing Tong to uphold justice for little Cherry. So he cooperated with his young master and said, \u201cIt\u2019s cultivator Jin Tong. And that one standing there is him.\u201d\u201cSir Cultivator Jin Tong, please speak something for my son.\u201d Said Rong Yi.Jin Tong had to walk out of the crowd and asked with his tongue in his cheek, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dKnowing that Jin Tong was the eldest disciple of Immortal Yunyi, the chief guard respectfully explained him the whole story.After hearing this, Jin Tong murmured softly and said gently, \u201cSince it\u2019s the new rule of the school, we should all follow it, otherwise, no one will abide by the rules and regulations of the school in the future.\u201dImmortal Yunyi slightly narrowed his eyes.Rong Yi asked coldly, \u201cSo do you think it is right to punish a kid without informing the kids that toys are not allowed to take to school in advance?\u201dJin Tong said with a face of \u2018awe-inspiring\u2019, \u201cThere must be some reason for the school to do so, and the punishment was also to make its disciples remember the mistakes they have made. Besides, junior Yin was absolutely wrong for bringing toys to play on the campus. He influenced his senior brothers to become fond of playing and no longer focus on cultivation. If our master shifu knows this, I believe he would not agree with his disciples\u2019 focus on playing toys.\u201d\u201cBut why are you using a magic weapon for punishing a kid? Are you really punishing him or trying to kill him?\u201d\u201cWhen the guards punish the disciples, they usually use ordinary sticks. They chose to use a magic weapon only because Yin Tao did not obey or rebelled against them. If you want him to stay in the school and learn how to smelt weapons, you should obey the orders.\u201dRong Yi sneered, \u201cYin Tao is only a three-year-old child. Even if he resisted, there was no need to take out a magic weapon prepared to deal with cultivators in Base Practicing to deal with him. In doing so, you clearly tried to kill my son. Now I really doubt that you are the teacher who taught my son how to smelt weapons. You didn\u2019t make any voice to defend him, instead, everything you said was pushing him to the opposite side. I can tell you even wish the schools guards could give him a good beating.\u201dThose words had precisely pierced through Jin Tong\u2019s mind. If he kept talking, Jing Tong\u2019s previous plans would all fall through.So Jin Tong winked quietly at the school guards.Those school guards immediately surrounded him.Su Gu hurriedly took out the magic weapon.Immortal Yunyi stepped forward, covering Rong Yi\u2019s group behind him. He pulled on his shapeshifting rune and said angrily, \u201cLet me see who dares to step forward!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What is master shifu doing here?Does it mean master shifu has seen the whole process?Jin Tong felt his legs turned into jello at once. Although he seemed to be following the rules and regulations of the school just now, after all, it was he who did not do the right thing on behalf of the school first. And he let Yin Tao take the punishment. His master shifu must have seen him through already. It was possible that his relationship with master Immortal Yunyi would come to an end.\u201cJin Tong, do you still remember what you have promised me before?\u201d said Immortal Yunyi sternly with a cold face. \u201cYou promised me that you would take good care of Yin Tao. You said that even if Yin Tao did something wrong, you would protect him unconditionally and I would be the one to decide whether Yin Tao was right or wrong. You also said that you would treat Yin Tao as your blood brother and would not let him suffer from any harm. But see what you have done just now!\u201dIf it hadn\u2019t been for his sudden visit to the school with Rong Yi, Immortal Yunyi would never know that Jin Tong, who showed great love to Yin Tao in front of him, would not only not protect his junior brother but also expose him to danger, hoping Yin Tao would be severely dealt with.Immortal Yunyi\u2019s face turned gloomier at the thought of the words of his disciples and their guards he had heard from behind the rockery. He had thought maybe it was their random guesses at the beginning. After seeing Jin Tong\u2019s performance, he even felt that all this was arranged by Jin Tong because Jin Tong\u2019s intention was too obvious even to a blind man. As a man who had gone through too much, he clearly knew that Jin Tong was jealous of Yin Tao\u2019s talent.Unfortunately, there was no solid evidence against him.Jin Tong hastened to explain, \u201cMaster shifu, junior Yin made the mistake first, I just\u2026\u201d\u201cMade a mistake?\u201d Immortal Yunyi was so pissed off, \u201cTell me, was is really such a big mistake that a three-year-old baby brings toys to play on the campus that you need you to punish him so severely? I know the school has its rules and regulations. Since the new rule has just been drawn up, you should have informed all the disciples first. If anyone dares to break the rule after knowing it, it is not too late to punish them then. However, if you suddenly change the rules and regulations without informing them, everyone could be punished at will. Do you think you still have any reason for doing that? What was the difference between your behavior and a robber robbing others? If you succeed this time, will you change the rules and regulations at will and find excuses to punish them in the future?\u201dThe more he said about it, the angrier he became. He turned to a certain direction and lifted his voice in an angry way, \u201cYing Shidao, move your ass here.\u201dYing Shidao was the dean of Haishan Academy. Hearing the roar of Immortal Yunyi, his legs softened on the spot and he almost fell to the ground. He hurried to fly by his sword to the garden where Immortal Yunyi was at, \u201cImmortal Yunyi, my greetings.\u201dImmortal Yunyi snapped, \u201cWhy did you suddenly want to amend the regulations of the school? After revising the rules and regulations without informing the disciples, do you think this practice can convince the public? It will only damage the reputation of our school and the Jiuxu Sect if people hear about it. The duty of the school guard is to protect our safety, not to punish the disciples.\u201dHe pointed to the guard who was lying on the ground after getting beaten by him, \u201cLook at your dutiful guard. He punished our disciple with a magic weapon. Half of the disciples in the school are only newly admitted kids who nearly have no cultivation. How can they bear the power of the cultivator in Base Practicing? I think your guard was not aiming at punishing but was trying to kill the kid. You really let me down. From today on, I will revoke your position and replace you with Elder Qiu Kui. When I return to Nine Void Sect, I will report the matter to the chief.\u201dYing Shidao\u2019s face turned pale. If he lost his position as the dean, he would have no place in Haishan City. And after he went back to Nine Void Sect, he would be laughed at by his peers and would live a shameful life.He quickly knelt down and said, \u201cImmortal Yunyi, I really have nothing to do with all these..\u201dJin Tong\u2019s heart started to pump in an instant and he stared at Ying Shidao with warning eyes.Immortal Yunyi then pushed him, \u201cYou changed the regulations. You tell me who has something to do with it!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I\u2026\u201d Ying Shidao took a glance at Jin Tong.Jin Tong went to see him the day before yesterday, asking him to revise the regulations of the school to forbid all disciples to bring toys to the school. He said that children should be discouraged from playing with toys. Moreover, the regulations should be implemented immediately even before announcing it. Only by doing so could they keep it in mind and would not focus on playing only.It was a good thing not to let children indulge in playing, but the dean actually didn\u2019t agree to immediately implement the new regulations without announcing them to those disciples. However, Jin Tong, the great grandson of the chief of Nine Void Sect and the eldest disciple of Immortal Yunyi, insisted on it. Moreover, he thought that Jin Tong only wanted to kick out someone from the school using the new regulations, not intend to kill or result in some bad consequences.He was now riding a tiger, not knowing how to survive. If he told the truth, he would become Jin Tong\u2019s target; if not, he would be immediately expelled from the school. What should he do?Rong Yi, who was standing aside to appease the child, saw that Ying Shidao was looking at Jin Tong with a face full of helplessness. So he thought that he could not let the dean be the scapegoat of Jin Tong. So he said aloud, \u201cDean, why are you looking at Jin Tong? Is it possible it is related to him?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayImmortal Yunyi had a bad feeling because Ying Shidao gave a look at Jin Tong, which made him more certain that it was Jin Tong behind all these things, and his heart immediately sank to the bottom.\u201cIf you think I am a part of this just because Dean Ying took a look at me, isn\u2019t it too hasty to jump to conclusions?\u201d Jin Tong tried to look nonchalant and said to Ying Shidao, \u201cDean Ying, say something. Am I part of this?\u201dGetting his threat in the eyes, Rong Yi cut in before Ying Shidao opened his mouth, \u201cDean Ying, just tell the truth. Immortal Yunyi wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d\u201cYing Shidao, if you are not a part of this, I won\u2019t dismiss your position and guarantee that no one could hurt you. And I will punish those who take advantage of the school regulations to hurt my disciples.\u201d Said Immortal Yunyi seriously as he stared at Jin Tong.Jin Tong felt a chill running from head to toes.Master shifu knew!Master shifu must know it was him. That was why he gave his words to Ying Shidao.As Ying Shidao made sure that Immortal Yunyi wouldn\u2019t be partial to his own people, he was relieved, \u201cTo tell the truth, it was Jin Tong who asked me to modify the regulations and ordered me to punish the disciple before announcing it. I didn\u2019t agree with him in the first place. But given that he was the great-great-grandson of the chief and also your eldest disciple, I could only give my permission to modify it. But as for other thing Jin Tong had done, I really have no idea, let alone be part of it. But I should also take the blame anyway. Please punish me, Immortal Yunyi.\u201d\u201cYou are lying.\u201d Jin Tong shouted, \u201cMaster shifu, what he said was total nonsense. I never did such a thing.\u201dNo! There was no way he should admit it!Otherwise, the master shifu wouldn\u2019t spare him.\u201cJin Tong, do you have anything to say?\u201d Yunyi glared at Jin Tong.\u201cShifu, you can\u2019t believe what he said. He is passing the buck to me because he is afraid of losing his position as the dean.\u201d Jin Tong tried to argue.Ying Shidao hurriedly argued, \u201cIf I lie on a single word, I\u2019m gonna die in my boots!\u201dYunyi summoned all the elders of the school and asked them to take Jin Tong back to Nine Void Sect, \u201cGround him at my cave and I will punish him later when I go back.\u201d\u201cShifu, I really didn\u2019t do anything to hurt Yin Tao, I swear!\u201d Jin Tong still wouldn\u2019t give up before he was taken away.The disciples were happy that Jin Tong was taken away because they didn\u2019t have to humble themselves in front of him anymore, nor do they have to flatter him on a daily basis, nor do they have to send him gifts in private.\u201cYou even deny it after everything is all crystal clear.\u201d Immortal Yunyi was disappointed at Jin Tong and said to Ying Shidao, \u201cThere is no chance you could get away from this. Without your approval, none of these would happen. But given that you only did this for once and you are honest to admit your mistakes, and you still need to run many school affairs, you are free from serious punishment. But you are deducted ten-year salary as a warning. If such a thing happens again, you will not only be deprived of your position as the dean.\u201d\u201cYes, shifu.\u201d\u201cAnd, I don\u2019t want to see anyone who would hurt my little disciple anymore.\u201d Immortal Yunyi gave a look at the bodyguards while saying those words.\u201cI will replace them with a brand new group of guards.\u201d Said Ying Shidao.\u201cChildren should take a break between classes. And their playing time during breaks wouldn\u2019t affect their cultivation. There is no need to modify school regulations at all.\u201d Immortal Yunyi nodded satisfactorily.\u201cI will withdraw the new regulations right now.\u201d\u201cOff you go.\u201dYing Shidao turned away and ordered the rest of the crowd to go back to have their classes.Jia Shi and Xiao Zhi left with their own little masters.\u201cWe are dead. We are so dead.\u201d Xiao Zhi said with a pale face, \u201cWe just pointed at Yin Tao and said that he had the most toys in front of Immortal Yunyi and got Yin Tao punished. Immortal Yunyi should have put the blame on us now.\u201dIf they had known that Immortal Yunyi was here, they would not have been so stupid as to say that Yin Tao had the most toys.\u201cYeah! He didn\u2019t even let go of his own disciple, let alone us who are no body to him.\u201d Jia Shi and Xiao Zhi looked back secretly and were relieved that Immortal Yunyi didn\u2019t look at them. But they saw something that made everyone\u2019s jaw drop.Immortal Yunyi, the person that everyone would try to suck up \u00a0to, was helping Rong Yi, a sissy pant that was known to all, sit down with extra care and served him a cup of tea as if he was a servant to him.\u201cRong Yi, have you already known that Jin Tong was jealous of little Cherry\u2019s talent in the first place, haven\u2019t you? So you deliberately brought me here to get him exposed, right?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that no one would bully my little Cherry? So I brought you here to see for yourself how he is at school so that you\u2019ll believe how he\u2019s doing.\u201d Rong Yi sneered.\u201cIt never occurred to me that Jin Tong would treat little Cherry differently in front of and behind me. But I assure you that I will certainly punish Jin Tong very hard later when I go back.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the priority, I\u2019m afraid. Jintong even suggested the guards to stop their little masters from playing with our little master. That was why he was all alone refining magic weapons in class every day. I already feel sorry for him on picturing it.\u201d Su Gu took the opportunity and added.\u201cYou mean seriously?\u201d\u201cMore than that, Jin Tong even scolds our little master every day for making shit magic weapons.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d\u201cWithout evidence, you will not believe it and he will not admit it. Other guards won\u2019t speak for us being afraid of offending him.\u201dHearing this, Immortal Yunyi decided to go back and punish Jin Tong immediately for venting his anger for his little disciple. He felt so sorry for Yin Tao,, \u201cLittle Yin Tao, come here . Let me give you a hug.\u201dYin Tao, however, cowered into Rongyi\u2019s arms with red eyes. He was indeed terrified just now.Rong Yi patted Yin Tao on the back and sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to punish the chief\u2019s great-great-grandson.\u201dPerhaps with a word of the chief, Immortal Yunyi would let go of Jin Tong.\u201cNot to mention that he is the great-great-grandson of the chief, even if he is my chief\u2019s father, I will not go easy on him this time.\u201d\u201cImmortal Yunyi. Immortal Yunyi. Bad news! Bad news!\u201d An elder who had just sent Jin Tong back to Nine Void Sect hurried back.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Immortal Yunyi frowned.\u201cWhen we were on our way to Haishan Academy, two ghost cultivators suddenly appeared to look for troubles and they broke his dantian (the pubic region) in the fight.\u201dWhen Rong Yi heard the words \u201cghost cultivators\u201d, his intuition told him it was Yin Jinye who sent someone to do it. After all, it was too coincidental that Jin Tong\u2019s dantian was destroyed right after he just injured Yin Tao.\u201cWhat? Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Immortal Yunyi stood up quickly to say goodbye to Rong Yi and left with the elder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But before they could speak, Rong Su, Rong Huan and Wen Chuan hurriedly gathered around and asked, \u201cIs the little master all right? Did he get hurt?\u201dBefore they came back, Rong Yi had already applied some medicine for him and his wound was almost healed.Rong Yi narrowed his eyes,\u201d how do you know he was hurt?\u201dWen Chuan confessed, \u201cSince you gave an early birth to the little master, her ladyship has sent some guards to protect you and the little master secretly. And they would report it to us or the master if there is anything wrong.\u201d\u201cSo you mean even if Immortal Yun didn\u2019t stop the school guards hurting little Cherry, they would lend a hand?\u201d Rong Yi looked at Su Gu and asked, \u201cDo you know about this?\u201dHe noticed Su Gu was very anxious at that time, so it was quite possible he didn\u2019t know.Su Gu shook his head, as he expected.\u201cNot many people know about it,\u201d Wen Chuan said.Rong Huan came over and said, \u201cMaster, let me hold the little master for you, please.\u201dBut Yin Tao held Rong Yi\u2019s neck tightly and wouldn\u2019t let go.It was painful for everyone to see Yin Tao lose his innocence and get so sensitive.\u201cWhat the heck! It was his luck just to destroy his dantian.\u201d Rong Su cursed angrily.\u201cIt was really his luck if he got killed. But it is different that we damage his dantian because he will no longer have the ability to cultivate. He will live in pain all his life and be laughed at by others.\u201d Rong Huan said.\u201cIt is really you people who did this?\u201d Rong Yi said.\u201cThe master gave us the order.\u201dRong Yi hummed slightly, \u201cNot bad. Now he knows to care his son after he got bullied.\u201dWen Chuan then tried to speak for Yin Jinye, \u201cIn fact, the master looks cold but he warm inside.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Rong Yi went into the hall and saw Yin Jinye sitting on a chair. He put Yin Tao on his lap and said, \u201cDaddy, your son is seriously scared. Comfort your son.\u201dYin Jinye looked down at Yin Tao who had swollen and watery eyes, he couldn\u2019t help raising a hand to rub his little head.\u201cLittle master, your father has disabled that big villain for you. Are you happy?\u201d asked Xing He who was standing aside.Yin Tao stared at him and didn\u2019t say a word\u201cOh no! The little master even doesn\u2019t know how to smile.\u201d Xinghe was worried.Other servants were also very worried about Yin Tao.\u201cAre there any other big towns near our big city?\u201d Rong Yi sat down and asked Rong Su.\u201cThere is a city called Linhai, which is a thousand li(five hundred meters long) away from Haishan city. It takes about half an hour to fly there by sword.\u201d\u201cWell, we will go on a trip to Linhai city tomorrow. But since little Cherry and I haven\u2019t been fasted yet, we will certainly be hungry on the way. You should prepare delicious pastries, such as osmanthus cake, begonia cakes, lotus cake, silver silk rolls, lotus seed cakes\u2026 \u201cRong Yi saw Yin Tao\u2019s eyes were sparkling every time he named one kind of cake. He looked at his little son \u00a0who was supporting his chin with one hand awkwardly, \u201cWe are going out for a trip. Are you happy? If you are not, we are not going.\u201dOn hearing that, Yin Tao immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going, daddy, I\u2019m going.\u201dAs he finally talked, everyone felt much relieved.Rong Yi asked, \u201cWhat pastries would like to bring tomorrow? Tell the butler to prepare them for you.\u201dYin Tao instantly turned to Wen Chuan and said, \u201cI want to eat cloud cakes and crystal cakes and\u2026 \u201d\u201cNo problem, little master.\u201d Wen Chuan said with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m going to take my toys with me.

We are going to travel.\u201dRong Yi struggled to open his eyes and looked out of the window at the dark sky with shining stars, \u201cwhat the fuck! It is not bright outside. I am not getting up.\u201d\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s Yin hour (an ancient way of timing. People divided a day into twelve hours. And each hour had its name like Yin hour and Mao hour that appears later.).\u201d Yin Tao pouted.Yin hour? Only three o \u2018clock in the morning?\u201cOh my god! You wake me up at three in the morning? I can tell how much you are expecting this trip!\u201d Rong Yi really wanted to slap himself on the face. He was having his own medicine. Why would he suggest going out on a trip? \u201cCan I sleep for a bit? You wake me up at Mao hour (five to seven in the morning).\u201dYin Tao gave him a hasty push as Rong Yi closed his eyes again, \u201cDaddy, daddy\u2026 \u201dRong Yi really couldn\u2019t take it, so he asked, \u201cSon, do you care about your daddy who is pregnant with your little brother and couldn\u2019t even have a good sleep?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Yin Tao nodded.\u201cThen be good and let me have some more sleep. I\u2019m gonna play with you when I have good enough sleep, OK?\u201d Rong Yi suddenly admired his second elder brother sincerely for the very first time. He already felt extremely exhausted to take care of only one child. But his brother had to play with five children every day. \u201cOh, right. You can go wake up your father first.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Yin Tao giggled, quickly slipped of the bed and ran barefooted to the room on the other side, \u201cFather, father.\u201dYin Jinye, who was mediating, opened his eyes to give Yin Tao a look and then closed his eyes again.Yin Tao ran up to him and tugged at his sleeve. \u201cFather, father. It\u2019s time to go traveling.\u201dYin Jinye did not respond to him.Yin Tao called him again, \u201cFather, father. It\u2019s time to go traveling.\u201dYin Jinye frowned at his noise and opened his eyes, saying flatly, \u201cWhat about your daddy?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d\u201cTell him to get up and wash up before you come to me.\u201dYin Tao stood there looking up at him.Yin Jinye raised his eyebrow, \u201cYou got a problem?\u201dYin Tao asked, \u201cFather, do you care about daddy?\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026 \u201dWhy did he suddenly ask such a question?Yin Tao then asked, \u201cDo you care about daddy who is pregnant with my little brother and even couldn\u2019t have a good sleep?\u201dYin Jinye,\u201d\u2026 \u201d\u201cIf you do, you should let daddy sleep more.\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026 \u201dYin Tao tugged his sleeve again. \u201cGet up, father. We can carry daddy into the carriage.\u201dWhen he could not get up in the morning, Su Gu would carry him into the carriage on school days.Yin Jinye, \u201c!!!!!! \u201dTo carry him into the carriage?\u201cCome on! Come on!\u201d urged Yin Tao.Yin Jinye\u2019s lips twitched and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cSo you don\u2019t care me at all?\u201dYin Tao looked down at his belly, then up at his face with that pair of bit and bright eyes, \u201cFather, do you have a little brother in your belly too?\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026 \u201dXinghe who was meditating on the roof really couldn\u2019t help laughing hearing the child\u2019s babble of little Yin Tao.Yin Jinye caught a glimpse of the roof, \u201cYou carry Rong Yi into the carriage.\u201d\u201cMy lord, he is your partner. It is not appropriate for me to carry him. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Xinghe.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFather, get up.\u201d Yin Tao dragged him into Rong Yi\u2019s room and shushed him, \u201cDaddy is sleeping. We should keep quiet.\u201dHe dragged Yin Jinye all the way to the bed to look at Rong Yi who was asleep. The black and loose hair made him look more like a woman. He was quiet and beautiful like a sleeping elf, with that small face and thin, rosy lips. He didn\u2019t sleep well and even frowned because he had to lie on one side due to the big belly.Yin Tao gave Yin Jinye a hasty push as his father froze there as he was staring at daddy\u2019s face.Yin Jinye then came to senses, gently bent down to pick Rong Yi up. For a cultivator, Rong Yi\u2019s weight was nothing even he was carrying that big belly.Rong Yi, who was half asleep, opened his sharp eyes as he sensed that someone was holding him. But when he saw it was Yin Jinye, he was a little surprised but then closed his eyes at ease.\u201cNow that you are awake, get off me and walk.\u201d Yin Jinye said.Rong Yi didn\u2019t mind being carried by a man in his arms at all. So he closed eyes and played sleeping. Now that he was even carrying a baby, how would he mind being carried by a man? And it felt not bad going from one place to another in a man\u2019s arms. Only a fool would come down and walk carrying that big belly.Looking at the man who was lying comfortably in his arms, Yin Jinye narrowed his eyes, turned around and tried to throw him into the pond full of lotus flowers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Rong Yi already anticipated Yin Jinye\u2019s reaction, he grabbed Yin\u2019s collar and pulled himself back at the very moment he was thrown out and put his arms around Yin tightly like an octopus.Rong Yi grinned, \u201cDaddy, am I quick-witted or not? Did I pass your test?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Yin Jinye.Who said he was testing him?He really meant to toss him into the pond to fresh his mind.\u201cYou just freaked me out, and also the baby in my belly. Now you have to carry me out even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Rong Yi leaned his head on Yin Jinye\u2019s shoulder as if he was \u2018ill\u2019 and suddenly bit Yin Jinye in the shoulder.He used all his strength he had and even with his spiritual power to bite him so that Yin Jinye would never throw him again. He asked for it to throw a pregnant man like this. Hum! Although for now he didn\u2019t have the power to beat him, he did have the capability to bite him. Thanks to Yin\u2019s ordinary robes, he could bite hard on his shoulder. Even so, Yin Jinye only felt a little sting because his spiritual power was too significant.Yin Jinye could not help frowning.This man was smart. He didn\u2019t act that he was angry at the beginning. Instead, he lowered his guard in a playful stone and bit him when he was not prepared for it.Rong Yi let go of him quickly before he got angry and said with a tone of slight anger, \u201cI bite you because I want to stress that you can not throw a pregnant man. If you do that ever again, I will\u2026\u201dHe hit Yin Jinye\u2019s crotch with his lower body, \u201ccastrate you.\u201dYin Jinye half narrowed his eyes and asked, \u201cDo you really think you have that ability?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it now, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t forever. It\u2019s never too late to take revenge. For me, I can wait for a thousand years.\u201dSince Yin Jinye was already at a high level, it meant that it would take him a long time to promote to the next. But the situation was different for Rong Yi since he was only at an entry level. He would promote much faster than Yin. Sooner or later he will catch up with him.\u201cYour words tip me. Should I kill you before you take revenge?\u201d Yin Jinye raised his eyebrows.\u201cSon, your father said that he will kill me. If I am dead, remember to avenge me.\u201d Rong Yi immediately shouted to Yin Tao.\u201cI will.\u201d Yin Tao agreed although he barely understood the situation.\u201c\u2026\u201dYin Jinye.\u201cYin Jinye, I take credit for giving a birth to your child and being pregnant for four years as a man. I don\u2019t expect you to repay me a lot. But at least you should treat me well. If you do it again, I will really get upset and I will\u2026\u201d Rong Yi hit Yin Jinye\u2019s private part with his lower body again, \u201ccastrate you.\u201dIt could be seen from Yin Jinye\u2019s move that he didn\u2019t take his words seriously. After all, they only spent one week together only. He needed to work harder to, at least, make Yin Jinye regard him with special respect. He didn\u2019t have to be the most important person in his heart. Yin Jinye spanked him gently and said, \u201cIf you play dirty again, I will throw you into the pond right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi now realized that he just hit Yin\u2019s \u2018little brother\u2019 with his \u2019little pal\u2019. He then coughed awkwardly, \u201cThen you should at least carry me upward a bit.\u201dYin Jinye gave it a thought and held Rong Yi upward.\u201cLittle Cherry, tell your father what is daddy for?\u201d Rong Yi asked Yin Tao.\u201cYou breastmilk me.\u201d Yin Tao gave a quick answer.Yin Jinye smiled a bit at Yin Tao\u2019s childish answer.\u201cOh my! Is that all you think of me? Am I that useless to you?\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes at him, \u201cremember what I said to you back in the room? All right. Let me ask you one more time, what do we do as daddy and son?\u201dYin Tao was a bit confused and answered hesitantly, \u201cCare about\u2026\u201dRong Yi smiled, \u201cRight. Use your biggest voice! Tell your father, what is daddy for?\u201dYin Tao then shouted happily, \u201cTo care about!\u201d\u201cYou heard him. Your three-year-old son knows to care about his daddy. You should learn from him.\u201d Rong Yi said to Yin Jinye.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen the three of them came to the gate.The servants had prepared a carriage which was twice the size of the one they used yesterday. It was even big enough for Yin Yao to make a rollover in it.Wen Chuan smiled bigger as he saw Yin Jinye was carrying Rong Yi. He picked up Yin Tao and asked Rong Yi, \u201cYoung master, seven days later, the annual contest of Nine Void Sect will begin. Is there anything you need me to do? Or should I prepare it as previous years?\u201dIf he didn\u2019t mention it, Rong Yi had already forgotten it, \u201cI have no intention of going.\u201dBut giving it a second thought, he added, \u201cForget it. We will see when we get back.\u201dHe had not intended to go because all competitions were similarly boring. Besides, without any memory of the original Rong Yi, it was strange if he could not be able to recognize people whom he may meet. However, if he did not go, he would know much less about the world which would be a great loss, and he would have no chance to see how miserable Jin Tong is now. It would be a pity if he missed out.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wen Chuan put the boy in the cart and then handed a storage ring \u00a0over to Rong Yi, \u201cI have put all your luggage and food in the storage ring which could sustain you for a few days.\u201dRong Yi took the ring and thanked him, \u201cthank you.\u201dYin Jinye then carried Rong Yi up into the cart.After them, Rong Su, Xinghe, Su Gu flew up to sit on the top of the cart and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We are going travelling.\u201dRong Yi sat beside him and asked, \u201cAre you really so happy?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. It\u2019s my first time to go out with daddy and father, and also, my little brother.\u201d Yin Tao threw himself into Rong Yi\u2019s arms and whispered to his stomach, \u201cLittle brother, we are going on a trip. We are going to Linhai city. Are you happy?\u201dLike the baby heard him, it kicked a bit as a response.Rong Yi thought it was cute the way little Yin Tao was talking to his belly using that child\u2019s tone. He rubbed his head and said, \u201cIt takes half an hour to get to Linhai City. We can take a nap so we will have enough energy for fun later.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Yin Tao yawned and lay down beside him obediently.Rong Yi said to Yin Jinye, \u201cWe are gonna sleep for a while and wake us up when the sun is about to rise.\u201dYin Jinye closed his eyes for meditation and did not answer him.Rong Yi then kicked him, \u201cWhen people talk to you, you should answer politely.\u201dYin Jinye opened his eyes and said, \u201cHmm.\u201dRong Yi smiled with satisfaction and lay down to hold Yin Tao in his arms. He rubbed him like he was a baby doll and closed his eyes contentedly.Yin Jinye stared at them for quite a while before he closed his eyes, but soon opened his eyes again. Looking at the two similar faces, he took out a big robe to cover on them, then closed his eyes to get back to meditation again.At the time of Mao hour (5-7 a.m.), the sky started to get bright.Yin Jinye opened his eyes to look out of the window and said to the sleeping daddy and son, \u201cThe sun rises!\u201dRong Yi opened his eyes and saw the bright sky outside the window. He then pushed Yin Tao. \u201cWake up, little Tao. It\u2019s dawn.\u201dYin Tao opened his barely-awake eyes and rubbed Rong Yi\u2019s chest, \u201cDaddy, hungry\u2026\u201dThe next moment, he was biting Rong Yi\u2019s chest accurately.\u201cOuch\u2026 \u201cThe pain in his chest made Rong Yi sober instantly. He was so angry that he pranked Yin Tao. \u201cYou damn kid! You promised that you won\u2019t bite my breasts, didn\u2019t you?\u201dYin Tao took several mouthfuls of blood before he woke up completely. He let go of the breast and looked at Rong Yi innocently.\u201cGet up, get up.\u201d Rong Yi asked Rong Su who was sitting on the roof, \u201cSu, do you have some vulnerary?\u201dThen a bottle of vulnerary was thrown into the cart.Rong Yi tore open the only coat he was wearing to reveal his fairy chest, and there were two bloody teeth marks on it, \u201cWhat the hell! How could your teeth be so sharp?\u201dYin Jinye looked over at his chest which drew all his attention.Rong Yi opened the bottle, dipped the ointment onto his fingertip and gently applied it to the wound.Yin Jinye narrowed his eyes as he noticed the pink tit next to the wound.As Rong Yi sensed that someone was staring at him, he quickly raised his head but got confused when he saw Yin Jinye was still meditating with his eyes closed. Was he paranoid?\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Yin Tao threw himself into Rong Yi\u2019s arms.Rong Yi, who got dressed up already, pranked him softly, \u201cYou should eat it later. Now we should enjoy the sunrise.\u201d\u201cSunrise?\u201d Yin Tao was too young to understand the beauty of the sunrise.Rong Yi held him to sit next to the window. Outside was a boundless sea.Yin Tao said, \u201cIt\u2019s a big lake.\u201dRong Yi said with a smile, \u201cit\u2019s not lake. It\u2019s called sea.\u201dHe pointed to the bright line on the horizon and said with a smile. \u201cYou see, the sun is coming up.\u201dThe three men sitting on the roof of the cart also opened their eyes and looked to the east in the distance. The horizon was shining with bright light. Soon, a small part of the sun emerged from the surface of sea water. The bright sunshine shone the entire sea and also all their faces.At this moment everyone\u2019s heart was as calm as the sea. They were too astonished to look away.Rong Yi then turned around and shouted at Yin Jinye, \u201cDaddy, you should come and see this. You won\u2019t want to miss out the beauty of the sunrise.\u201dYin Jinye open his eyes and saw the handsome face glittering under the sunshine. He then moved over involuntarily.Rong Yi put his hand on his shoulder like they were good buddies, \u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201dYin Jinye turned his head to Rong Yi and responded with an \u201chmm\u201d slightly.Rong Yi rubbed Yin Tao\u2019s head and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful, son?\u201dYin Tao nodded, \u201cIt is, like an egg cake.\u201dRong Yi tapped his head, \u201cCan you think of something else other than food?\u201dYin Tao giggled while saying, \u201cAnd daddy and father.\u201dRong Yi smiled, \u201cFine. You still have that little bit of consciousness.\u201dThen he saw a beach by the sea. He asked the wheeler to come to an anchor at the beach. Then he took off his clothes and was about to get out of the carriage.Yin Jinye said with a serious face, \u201cPut on your underlinen.\u201d\u201cHow am I going to swim with clothes on?\u201d Rong Yi was baffled by the displeasure in his voice. But he still put on his underlinen and rushed to the beach carrying Yin Tao who was drooling looking up to the sun in his arms, then he threw the boy into the water.Yin Tao swam out of the water and said happily, \u201cDo it again, do it again!\u201dRong Yi laughed and said, \u201cSo you think it\u2019s funny enough? You are easy to please. You\u2019ll have more fun later. Aren\u2019t you too happy to go back?\u201dYin Tao\u2019s eyes sparkled when he heard that there was something funnier to play with. He threw himself into Rong Yi\u2019s arms, \u201cDaddy, what should we play with now?\u201dSmiling without a word, Rong Yi turned back and waved at Rong Su.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRong Su quickly ran over and asked, \u201cYoung master, at your service.\u201d\u201cGo get a log for me in the woods nearby.\u201d Rong Yi described the roughs measurements.\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Rong Su left by flying his sword. About half an hour later, he brought back a log about ten feet long and two feet big.Su Gu and Xinghe gathered around out of curiosity, \u201cYoung master, what do you want to do with a log?\u201d\u201cMake a toy for Little Cherry.\u201d Rong Yi shapeshifted his magic bracelet into a sharp knife, cut the wood in half cleanly, then grinded them into two small boards with slightly narrow ends, one big and one small.Yin Tao looked excitedly at the toy which was about to take shape. \u201cDaddy, what kind of toy are you making for me this time?\u201d\u201cSort of surfboard, if I can call them that.\u201d Rong Yi set up the surfboard and asked Rong Su and others, \u201cDo you guys have a rope? It should be strong enough and about 300 chi (a unit of length, 1 chi equals 33.33cm) long.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Xinghe then took out a big ball of strong rope from the storage ring and handed it to Rong Yi.Rong Yi said, \u201cGive me your swords, Su Gu, Rong Su.\u201dRong Su and Su Gu then passed over their swords to Rong Yi.Rong Yi tied the hilts with two seventy-chi-long ropes and made a tight knot. Rong Su cast a protection enchantment on the end of the hilts to make sure the rope was firmly tightened. He tied one of the two ropes on a sword on Yin Tao and asked him to hold the other one in his hand. Then he put the surfboard on the water and put Yin Tao on the surfboard and make sure his two small feet were placed into the grove which enabled him to get attached to the board during surfing.After he prepared everything, he taught Yin Tao some basic knowledge of surfboard, like his gesture. When he was almost finished, he turned to Su Gu, \u201cSu Gu, you can now fly with your sword and drag Little Cherry on the water. Remember, don\u2019t start too fast. Start slowly and accelerate when he knows how to balance it.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Su Gu stepped on the sword and used his spiritual power to fly into the air, slowly dragging Yin Tao forward.It was the first time that Yin Tao surfed on water. He giggled excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun! So much fun! Daddy! I like it so much!\u201dRong Yi tied the rope of the other sword to his own body. And then he said to Rong Su with a smile, \u201cLet\u2019s chase them.\u201dThey followed behind, teaching Yin Tao how to keep balance.Sitting in the carriage, Yin Jinye was confused by Yin Tao\u2019s loud laughter. Was it really that fun to play with water?Out of curiosity, he got out of the carriage and saw Rong Yi and Yin Tao floating on the water and being pulled along. He went to Xinghe and asked, \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d\u201cSurfing. I\u2019ve never seen anyone being pulled over the water. It looks a lot fun. Even I now have the urge to try it.\u201d Xinghe said with a smile, \u201cThe young master has so many funny ideas. He even can make surfing so special.\u201dYin Jinye had the same thought too. Rong Yi had so many peculiar ideas and he could even make something that they had never seen or imagined before.Rong Yi waved at Yin Jinye as he saw him, \u201cDaddy, do you want to play with us?\u201dYin Jinye shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s fun. Come on. Come on!\u201dWithout saying anything, Yin Jinye signaled Xinghe to take out a table and a chair.Rong Su didn\u2019t fly fast as he was worried about Rong Yi\u2019s baby.As it was not fast and exciting enough with that speed and being pregnant was not convenient to play with water, he went ashore less than half an hour.\u201cYoung master, can I have a try?\u201d Xinghe quickly jumped on the surfboard and asked Rong Su to drag him on the water. Although it was his first time surfing on water and he didn\u2019t start perfectly, soon enough he got the hang of it since he learned martial arts and he had spiritual power with him. Soon he made turns, jumps, hops, and rollover freely. Rong Yi and Yin Tao envied him very much.Rong Yi dried his clothes and hair with his spiritual power, and sat next to Yin Jinye, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to have a try?\u201d\u201cNah.\u201d Yin Jinye then took out a book from his storage ring.Rong Yi rolled his eyes, \u201cWe are here to have fun. Why are you still reading books? How is that different from staying at home? No more books! Come on! It\u2019s a lot funnier to talk to me than to read books.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d Yin Jinye gave him a look.\u201cAbout us, of course\u201d Rong Yi took out the food, put it on the table and set bowls and chopsticks, \u201cWe are now partners, but we are still like literally total strangers.Since you came back, you either stay in your own room or study the whole day every day. Is there any difference between you coming back or not? If I didn\u2019t take the initiative to get close to you, we would not have met more than three times since you came back. Maybe we would still be strangers in a month or even a year, so\u2026 \u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Yin Jinye put the book back in his storage ring and listened to him with all ears.\u201cSo you should do your own duty as a father and a husband. For example, you should care about your son more. Such as, you should pick him up at school or take him out to have fun, or you can teach him to cultivate. Now that you don\u2019t need a secluded cultivation, you have a plenty of time to do other things. You should spend more time with us at dinner table or hanging out with us. It is very simple. You can do it, can\u2019t you?\u201d Rong Yi placed a bowl of porridge in front of him with a smile.\u201cThe duties as a father\u2026and a husband?\u201d Yin Jinye repeated slightly and asked, \u201cWhat you just said was the responsibility of a father. What is the responsibility of a husband?\u201d\u201cDo I need to say it? You should treat me well, of course, especially now when I am pregnant. You must not do things like throwing me into a pond earlier. You can\u2019t get physical with me either. I am not powerful enough to be punched by you, not even for once. You know, I am only at level 1 of Qi Practicing.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was confused why he suddenly became so easy to talk, \u201cand\u2026 and if I\u2019m in trouble or something goes wrong, you should be the first one to help me.\u201dThe best scenario would be that Yin Jinye could help him without hesitation When he was trying to transmigrate back to his own world.\u201cAnd?\u201d Yin Jinye asked again.\u201cAnd\u2026 \u201cRong Yi gave it a thought for a long time before he said, \u201cand\u2026and you can have a drink with me when you are free for bonding, so that we will not be total strangers like now.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cWhat else?!\u201d Rong Yi just wanted to get along with Yin Jinye in a different way and bond with him, and eventually they could become buddies who would get each other\u2019s back when needed. That was all he could think of, \u201cNothing. I guess that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cThere is one thing you haven\u2019t mentioned yet.\u201d Yin Jinye took a sip of his tea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIs there anything I didn\u2019t say?\u201d Rong Yi wondered. Why didn\u2019t he know he missed anything? \u201cSo what on earth is it? Just say it.\u201dYin Jinye smiled a bit, \u201cAs a husband, it is my obligation to satisfy you in bed.\u201dRong Yi got dumbfounded, only standing there looking at Yin Jinye dully.To his knowledge, Yin Jinye, like the original Rong Yi, was forced to accept this arranged marriage. Besides, the original Rong Yi had a wedding with Yin Jinye\u2019s memorial tablet. They were not literally husband and husband at all. It was already good enough that if Yin Jinye would treat him like a brother, given that he was such an indifferent person. Therefore, after he learned how he got pregnant, he knew that he was safe from having sex with a man and his back door was saved. That was why he had never thought of sex again. But now all things were out of his control.\u201cYou\u2026You\u2026You\u2026\u201dIt was the first time for Yin Jinye to see him stammer. He even smiled bigger, \u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026You are into men?\u201d Rong Yi stammered.\u201cAs long as I have feelings for that person, it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a she or he.\u201d Said Yin Jinye.Rong Yi had a feeling that he might lose his ass virginity, \u201cBut I am pregnant now. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201d Yin Jinye could not help but tease him.\u201cIntercourse cultivation.\u201d Rong Yi said with anger, \u201cYou are not that evil to make love to a pregnant man, are you?\u201d\u201cNo, of course I am not.\u201d Yin Jinye almost laughed out loud.Rong Yi felt much relieved on hearing him.\u201cI can wait for two years. It\u2019s affordable. To me, it is like a blink of an eye.\u201d Yin Jinye continued.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Could it be possible for him to overpower his own doom, become an immortal and transmigrate back to his own world in two years?Apparently the answer is negative.Suddenly, he felt the pain in his back door.\u201cEat some porridge.\u201d Yin Jinye put a spoonful of porridge by his mouth.Rong Yi opened his mouth subconsciously.\u201cYou should eat more because you are skinny.\u201d Yin Jinye scooped up another spoon, \u201cI prefer plumper body.\u201d\u201dAh-hem\u2026\u201d Rong Yi almost spitted the porridge out through his nose, \u201cWhat the fuck! Who is the one playing dirty?\u201dYin Jinye burst out laughing as he saw Rong Yi losing control.Rong Yi\u2019s mind went blank as he was astonished by Yin Jinye\u2019s elegant but kind of evil smile while he was eating the porridge Yin Jinye was feeding him. If Yin Jinye had been a woman, he would definitely have \u2018eaten him alive\u2019 right now.Yin Jinye was amused by Rong Yi\u2019s gazing eyes that revealed his true feelings. The way he gazed at him made him have the impulse to tease him. He took out a small spiritual stone, put it in the spoon and fed him.With all his attention to Yin Jinye, Rong Yi didn\u2019t even notice the spiritual stone. He opened his mouth, \u201cAh!\u201dAll of sudden, he felt sour and painful teeth. He quickly tilted his head and spit everything out.It was so funny that he was too attentive to look at him to notice the stone. Holding his laughter, Yin Jinye asked as if he didn\u2019t know, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI might have eaten a stone.\u201d Rong Yi looked down on the ground while he covered his face. Then he saw his vomit was blue. He picked up his chopsticks to remove the vomit, \u201cA spiritual stone? Why is there a spiritual stone in the porridge?\u201dWhen he looked in Yin Jinye\u2019s smiling eyes, he realized what had happened. He said angrily, \u201cDid you do this? You put the stone in the porridge, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThe cook must have left it in while he was cooking the porridge.\u201d Speaking of which, Yin Jinye fed him another spoon of porridge.What?! Did he think he was a fool? How could a cook take out a spiritual stone while he was cooking? If he did it by accident, he would definitely take it out, \u201cYou are fooling\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his sentence, Yin Jinye poured another spoonful of porridge into his mouth to shut his mouth.Asshole! Son of a bitch! He was definitely playing dumb! He knew it was him. Rong Yi stared at him angrily while he was chewing hard as if he was chewing Yin Jinye\u2019s flesh.Yin Jinye smiled slightly seeing he was so angry.Xinghe who was surfing on the sea was astonished when he saw Yin Jinye feeding Rong Yi with porridge. He lost his balance and fell off the surfboard. Rong Su dragged him right over the water for a while.Seeing that, Rong Su instantly stopped, flew down to pick up the surfboard and placed it before Xinghe, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cOf course I am not. So not right. I think I just had delusion just now. I saw that the lord is feeing our young master porridge.\u201d said Xinghe as he got down on the surfboard again.Yin Jinye had been indifferent to anyone since his soul was damaged. It never occurred to him that he fed his own mother with medicine with his own hands even if she got hurt. Now Xinghe was amazed to see that Yin Jinye feeding Rong Yi.\u201cYou are not having delusion. Lord is feeing young master.\u201d Rong Su looked over the beach.\u201cI will tell her ladyship about this.\u201d Xinghe dried his hands with spiritual power and wrote the old ma\u2019am a letter.Yin Tao played until he felt his belly was growling. Then he reluctantly went ashore for breakfast.After that, they flew to Linhai city, where Yin Tao could ride his tricycle in the streets as he wished. The strange tricycle attracted many people\u2019s eyes. People kept wondering what he was riding. They were wondering what that it.Yin Tao did not notice that everyone was looking at him. He rode his tricycle from one stall to another. He really enjoyed it. Once he was tired, he got off the bike and walked on the street holding Rong Yi\u2019s hand.When Yin Tao saw the child who was swung by his parents holding his hands in between, his eyes were brightened and he shouted excitedly, \u201cdaddy, daddy, want that.\u201dRong Yi took a look at the family of three in front of them and turned around and shouted: \u201chis father\u2026 \u201dYin Jinye frowned because he didn\u2019t like holding people\u2019s hands. Still, he reached for Yin Tao and lifted Yin Tao with Rong Yi.Yin Tao laughed happily loud. People around them were amused by his laughter.Rong Su elbowed Su Gu and whispered with a smile, \u201cthey finally look like a family.\u201dSu Gu smiled and nodded.It was not until the sun set and midnight after they returned to the beach to catch fish that they went back to Haishan City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t wake up until the next day.As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw an ugly masked face above his head. He was startled and transformed the bracelet into a sword, and pricked at that masked face.The masked face immediately vanished before his eyes and then appeared at the other end of the bed.Yin Jinye who was in another room broke in and stood in front of Rong Yi as he heard his scream.Rong Yi was relieved to see that Yin Jinye was here with him. He asked the masked man, \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe man wearing a mask knelt down, \u201cThis is your disciple Bu Qi, master shifu.\u201dYin Jinye then turned back at Rong YiDisciple? Rong Yi looked at Bu Qi, surprised, the disciple of the original Rong Yi? Did he even have taken a disciple? It was hard to believe that that sissy pant had a disciple.At this time, Rong Su and Xinghe also broke in and pointed their swords at Bu Qi. Wen Chuan walked in right after them and explained when he saw Bu Qi who was on one knee, \u201cMy lord, young master, his name is Bu Qi. Yesterday after your left, he came here with Immortal Yunyi\u2019s recommendation letter. Immortal Yunyi recommends him as your disciple. I told him to come back in a couple of days but he insisted on waiting here till you come back. So I could only arrange a room for him to stay.\u201d\u201cYou are the one that Yunyi talked about the other day?\u201d Rong Yi asked helplessly.Immortal Yunyi was very efficient to stuff a person to him. But the fact was that he didn\u2019t agree with him on that at all.\u201cYes.\u201d Bu Qi answered.\u201cWhy were you in my room? And showed up above my bed to scare me? Do you know that I was nearly frightened to death.\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes.Anyone would be scared by a masked face at the first sight in the early morning.\u201cMaster shifu, I was told that you would come back this morning. I was anxious to you soon. So I got in your room without your permission. And to see your face clearly, I flew up to the roof of your bed.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed that I will take you as my disciple. Don\u2019t call me master shifu this and master shifu that.\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s lips twitched.\u201cMy greetings, master shifu.\u201d Bu Qi made three hard kowtows to Rong Yi.\u201cWait. I haven\u2019t agreed yet.\u201d Rong Yi tried to stop him.As if he didn\u2019t hear Rong Yi at all, Bu Qi stood up, \u201cI will go get some water for you to fresh up, master shifu.\u201d\u201cCome back\u2026\u201d Rong Yi shouted at him but he walked out quickly, \u201cisn\u2019t he supposed to listen to me if he considers me as his master Sshifu? But he isn\u2019t. Why would I have a disciple like that then?\u201dRight after he said that, Bu Qi returned with a water basin in his hands, \u201cMaster shifu, I am back. At your service.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.It seemed that he couldn\u2019t chase this person away.Yin Jinye left the room as nothing really happened.Rong Su and Xinghe left too.Then Rong Huan walked in and said, \u201cYoung master, a man outside who claimed to be your disciple is looking for you.\u201d\u201cMy disciple? Again?\u201d Rong Yi looked at Bu Qi, \u201cDid Immortal Yunyi send some other people here other than you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRong Yi was confused. Where does this disciple come from?\u201cDid he tell his name?\u201d He asked Rong Huan.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cTell him to wait at the hall. I will be there in a minute.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dRong Yi stood up and Bu Qi immediately served him to get dressed and comb his hair for him, giving Rong Yi no chance to do it himself.When he came to the hall, he saw a middle-aged man sitting there drinking tea. He recognized it was Uncle Xiang who shared a yard with \u00a0Gongsu Ziqian in Hailu Village.\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201dXiang Lv immediately stood up and walked up to Rong Yi and greeted him, \u201cMaster shifu, my greetings.\u201d\u201cSince when have I taken you as my discople?\u201d asked Rong Yi.\u201cYou said that you would teach me to refine magic weapons if I take you as my master shifu a few days ago.\u201d Xiang Lv said.Having considered it for a few days, he finally made up his mind to learn officially from Rong Yi as he was curious how Rong Yi had refined the runes.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it when I said it. Don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d Rong Yi sat down, \u201cBesides, I have no intention to take anyone as my disciple.\u201d\u201cMaster shifu, please drink some tea.\u201d Bu Qi poured him a cup of tea.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Just right after he said that he didn\u2019t plan to take anyone as his disciple, Bu Qi called him master shifu. Wasn\u2019t he trying to slap him in the face?\u201cYou just said you would take no one as your disciple. Then who is he?\u201d Xiang Lv asked.\u201cMy nickname is master Shifu. Do you understand?\u201d Rong Yi rolled his eyes.Without arguing with him, Xiang Lv served him a cup of tea like Bu Qi did, \u201cMaster shifu, please drink some tea.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Xiang Lv then poured a cup of tea for Bu Qi, \u201cSenior brother, please drink some tea.\u201d\u201cThank you, junior brother.\u201d Bu Qi took the tea while saying so.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi.Was he just ignored by those two?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiang Lv And Bu Qi had been determined to take Rong Yi as their master shifu. Whatever Rong Yi did to expel them, they just wouldn\u2019t leave. Even after they got thrown out of the mansion by the servants, they again came back after wandering around nearby for some time.Rong Yi also didn\u2019t have that much energy, so he just let it be. But there was something he needed to make clear ahead, \u201cFrom the very beginning I already told you I have never considered taking any disciple. So don\u2019t expect me to specially spare some time to teach you how to enchant like other school or sect does. Just learn as much as you can in daily life with me. For the sake that you call me master shifu, you can come to ask me if you have something you don\u2019t understand.\u201dActually for him, it really didn\u2019t matter they called him shifu or not. But it had its benefits to be their shifu. He could ask them to do anything. Anyway, he wouldn\u2019t be their shifu for no good.Before Bu Qi came, Immortal Yunyi had already told him Rong Yi wouldn\u2019t teach him how to enchant. So after Rong Yi said those words, he nodded without any hesitation.\u201cGot it. Thank you, master shifu.\u201d Xiang Lv smiled deep from his heart. When he came, he was worried Rong Yi wouldn\u2019t take him in, after all Rong Yi really had ever said he wouldn\u2019t take him in as his disciple. So he already felt perfectly satisfied if he could learn a little from Rong Yi.Lei Sai, who had been hiding outside the window, dragged Rong Su into a corner, \u201cBu Qi is introduced by Immortal Yunyi. But who the hell is this Xiang Lv?\u201dXiang Su said, \u201cA cultivator of Hailu Village. The young master has refined his magic weapon there. The guy who has refined it for him lives in the same yard with Xiang Lv. He saw that our young master could even use herbs to refine magic weapon and also use low grade ingredients to refine holy magic weapon, so he decides to take the young master as his master shifu.\u201dLei Sai was a little confused, \u201cThe young master could ask me to do him the favor. Why did he make the detour to ask someone else to do it?\u201dIf he could refine the magic weapon for Rong Yi, maybe he already knew how Rong Yi had refined the magic weapon using herbs and low grade ingredients.\u201cThe young master said before you learn how to respect him, he won\u2019t teach you how to refine magic weapons.\u201dLei Sai said angrily, \u201cWhat the hell did I do to have offended him?\u201dRong Su patted his shoulder to calm him down, \u201cSenior Lei Sai, you call him young master by your mouth, but deep in your heart he is just a sissy, a whore. On your face you don\u2019t show a bit of respect. Anyone could tell you look down on our young master.\u201dLei Sai, \u201c\u2026\u201dAs Rong Su said, it was true he still hadn\u2019t take Rong Yi as his young master in his heart. But could it be his fault? If Rong Yi hadn\u2019t always worn that long face, and looked at them with that kind repugnant expression or talked to them using sarcasm all the time, why would he give Rong Yi some attitude?What annoyed him most was that Rong Yi took Yin Tao as his punch bag now and then. If he hadn\u2019t been pregnant with another baby, maybe he had already beaten the kid.\u201cRecently the young master has changed a lot. You should also change your attitude towards him. Maybe he is not that bad as you imagined.\u201dLei Sai gave him a look and nodded.\u201cIn the few days Nine Void Sect would hold the annual competition. All disciples of Haishan Academy would participate. And the little master and the young master would both join in. Huan and I will help the little master make preparations. Got to talk to you later.\u201dLei Sai said, \u201cI have already prepared the magic weapon for the little master. You don\u2019t have to do anything now.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the competition of Nine Void Sect was approaching, Rong Yi decided to meditate in seclusion with Yin Tao for a few days to cultivate. Without them horsing around, the mansion immediately became quite desolate.But no one was at a loose end. Except helping Rong Yi and Yin Tao prepare items for the competition, they all followed Rong Yi to improve their own cultivation.Just as Xiang Lv and Bu Qi lived in Yin Mansion, soon enough they both found that the spiritual qi here was thoroughly neat, which could help them double their cultivation speed by doing half of the work. Then they also noticed that the mansion had been set the Spiritual Cohesion Formation, which was a little different from what they had seen before. It could not only exclude the impurities in the spiritual qi, but also transmit the spiritual power into the cultivator\u2019s body actively, which could effectively improve the cultivator\u2019s cultivation speed.Xiang Lv and Bu Qi asked the servants about the Spiritual Cohesion Formation, After learning that it was set by their new master shifu, they were both mad with joy, especially Xiang Lv who finally felt relieved.Before he came, he had asked about Rong Yi. People all said Rong Yi was a sissy and liked seducing men. Now from what he had seen, Rong Yi neither was sissy nor he had done anything seducing a man, quite different from what he had heard from others\u2019 mouths.He believed his own eyes, besides, the rumors always deviated from the truth, so he chose to follow his own heart and came to take Rong Yi as his master shifu.Now he was very glad that he had not listened to other people\u2019s nonsense, or he would have missed the chance to learn the new method of refining magic weapons and also how to enchant.On the morning of the competition day, Rong Yi ended his cultivation early before it was complete dawn.He stretched himself and then turned to Yin Tao who was still meditating. Lips curled up, he got out of the room without making any noise. He saw that Yin Jinye was practicing swordplay, he waved at him and asked wearing a bright smile, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s been a few days. Did you miss me?\u201dYin Jinye glanced at him and then kept practicing his swordplay.Xinghe who was meditating on the roof then picked up the conversation, \u201cOf course. Every two hours, the master would put down the book and stare at your room for some time. Seeing you didn\u2019t come out, he then lowered his head and kept reading.\u201dRight after he finished his words, a severe gale chopped at him.Xinghe was a little surprised and immediately tried to dodge away. He then yelled at Yin Jinye down there, \u201cMy lord, do you really need to be so harsh? If I was a bit slower, I would have died.\u201dYin Jinye gave him a cold look and then kept practicing.Rong Xi smirked and didn\u2019t take Xinghe\u2019s words seriously.At this time, some noise came from the gate of Biluo Yard.Rong Su who was outside the gate tried to stop those who were coming in while saying, \u201cThe young master is cultivating. No guest is allowed.\u201d\u201cDo you take me as a fool? My little Yiyi has no spiritual root. How would he cultivate? Get out of the way. We want to see our little Yiyi. We\u2019ve got things for him. Don\u2019t stand in the way.\u201dIsn\u2019t it Qi Yueshi\u2019s sound? He has an absolute man\u2019s voice but always pinches his voice to talk like a woman. It really gives Rong Yi goose bumps.He said, \u201cSu, let them in.\u201dOn hearing Rong Yi, he immediately let them in.After Qi Yueshi and others came into the yard and saw Rong Yi, Qi Yueshi snorted faintly, \u201cHow dare he lied to us that little Yiyi is cultivating? Beat him!\u201dThen Qi Yueshi, Zhong Ziqiao, Tang Shangru and Zhu Xinyu spanked Rong Su each.Rong Su\u2019s face immediately reddened due to the super awkwardness, \u201cYou\u2026you guys\u2026\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe was also speechless towards Zhong Ziqiao and the other three. Fortunately his second elder brother would not molest other men before him.Qi Yueshi then smiled using a tiffany covering his mouth, \u201cYour little butt is really bouncy.\u201dZhong Ziqiao said smilingly, \u201cI just pinched him in the chest. Really tough.\u201dZhu Xinyu then scanned Rong Su\u2019s down part lustfully, \u201cDon\u2019t know whether his man part is big or not.\u201dTang Shangru covered his mouth and chuckled, \u201cI guess it should be pretty big, and handy.\u201dQi Yueshi asked curiously, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201dTang Shangru said shyly, \u201cBefore we came in, I bumped into him on purpose and rubbed his down part with my body, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou four goats! Never expect me to let you in next time.\u201d Rong Su really couldn\u2019t take it anymore. So he turned away and walked out of the yard angrily.Rong Yi quickly stopped them going on, \u201cThere are other people here. Don\u2019t say such indecent words.\u201dOn hearing him, Tang Shangru and the other three noticed that Yin Jinye and Xinghe were also in the yard.\u201cOh my god! Oh my god! I see a male god!\u201d On seeing Yin Jinye\u2019s godlike perfect face, Zhu Xinyu and others flew to Rong Yi\u2019s side, \u201cYiyi, who is the man holding a sword? He is so handsome! Even more handsome than your senior brother! Tell us! Who is he? Introduce him to us now!\u201dLike he didn\u2019t see them at all, Yin Jinye didn\u2019t stop swaying his sword at all.Rong Yi was worried they might go to flirt with Yin Jinye, so he immediately explained, \u201cThat is my partner.\u201d\u201cWhat? He is your partner? Come on. Hasn\u2019t he been dead already?\u201d They felt both pitiful and jealous.\u201cNo, he has survived.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Yiyi. You are so blessed. All men around you are so cute. I am so dead jealous.\u201d\u201cNever lay your finger on your friend\u2019s hubby. Since he is Yiyi\u2019s hubby, we won\u2019t take advantage of him then.\u201d Zhong Ziqiao winked at Rong Yi and teased him, \u201cYiyi, since your hubby is back, you wouldn\u2019t sleep alone, right? Has he satisfied you at night?\u201d\u201cDo you even need to ask? See his strong body and arms! He would definitely satisfy our Yiyi.\u201d Tang Shangru poked Rong Yi\u2019s waist, \u201cIs his bed skill as good as his sword skill?\u201dSince Yin Jinye was practicing his swordplay, he was wearing a black robe, exposing his strong body completely.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Rong Yi then peered at Yin Jin shyly to see if he had any reaction while the other party happened to be looking over to him. Two pairs of eyes collided, like getting an electric shock. Rong Yi instantly looked away, \u201cGet down to business. Get down to business. What are you doing here on such an early morning?\u201dZhu Xinyu still wouldn\u2019t let it go, \u201cI see your face looks ruddy. You should be moistened pretty well at night.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes, \u201cCan you guys keep it down? My partner and others would hear it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss?\u201d Qi Yueshi looked at Xinghe, \u201cOh right, Yiyi, who is the other man? He is also not bad. Can you at least introduce him to us?\u201dZhu Xinyu and others turned to Xinghe then. Xinghe smiled at them openly, \u201cMy name is Xinghe.\u201dTang Shangru\u2019s eyes shone, \u201cHe is even cuter than Rong Su.\u201dXinghe smiled, \u201cYou flatter me.\u201dAt this time, Lei Sai ran into the yard, \u201cMy lord, my lord\u2026\u201dThis was the first time Rong Yi saw him so panicked. So he was curious what had happened.Xinghe raised his eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhy are you in a hurry? This isn\u2019t you.\u201d\u201cComing\u2026He is here\u2026\u201d Lei Sai pointed at the gate, \u201cMaster Qi is here.\u201dXinghe\u2019s face changed a bit.Then an idle voice came out of the yard, \u201cYin Jinye, you have really kept me busy looking for you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then next moment, a coquettish man wearing aubergine robes came into the yard. In an instant, those delicate flowers suffered an eclipse because of his coming.Qi Yueshi and others dropped their jaws, feeling jealous in their hearts. If they could have been as pretty as he was, there would be numerous men chasing after them.Rong Yi was curious. Why was every man in this world so pretty?Qi Lan moved before Yin Jinye. After sizing him up and down, he chuckled, \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t have died so easily.\u201dYin Jinye said faintly, \u201cHow did you find here?\u201dQi Lan turned to Xinghe, \u201cThanks to the letter Xinghe wrote to the old madam. Otherwise I really couldn\u2019t find this place.\u201dHe found Haishan Town through Xinghe\u2019s paper bamboo dragonfly.Xinghe, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf he had known it\u2019d expose their whereabouts, he wouldn\u2019t have written that letter to the old madam.\u201cOh, I heard you have gotten married and even have kids now. I wonder who would be so lucky to be your partner.\u201d Qi Lan scanned everyone in the yard and finally laid his eyes on Rong Yi behind Xinghe, he then curled up his lips, \u201cIf I guess it right, it should that childe\u2026standing behind Xinghe.\u201dXinghe instantly felt his body tightened.Rong Yi was confused. Why even Xinghe and Lei Sai are so afraid of this man?Qi Lan chirped, \u201cOh, he looks not bad, but a little too weak. I can kill him like pinching an ant.\u201dHe then came before Rong Yi, \u201cI am Yin Jinye\u2019s senior brother Qi Lan. I\u2019m afraid I need to bother you for a few days. You wouldn\u2019t mind, would you?\u201dRong Yi thought although this person was showing a friendly smile, the information revealed in his eyes told him this person didn\u2019t like him, or he can say, hate him.He then moved forward from behind Xinghe, \u201cI am Jinye\u2019s partner Rong Yi. If he doesn\u2019t mind, I am totally OK.\u201dQi Lan picked his eyebrows, \u201cYou are quite interesting.\u201d\u201cOtherwise Jinye wouldn\u2019t take me as his partner and bear children for him.\u201d Rong Yi then winked at Yin Jinye, \u201cDaddy, am I right?\u201dHe thought Yin Jinye wouldn\u2019t pick up his words, but to his surprise, Yin Jinye nodded slightly and even responded with a \u201chmm\u201d.Qi Lan narrowed his pair of pretty eyes, saying smilingly, \u201cOh right, where is my little nephew? Why don\u2019t I see him?\u201dRight after he finished his words, Yin Tao who happened to finish his cultivation in the room shouted since Rong Yi was not in, \u201cDaddy, daddy!\u201dXinghe and Lei Sai quickly went in to stop him coming out, \u201cLittle master, it\u2019s almost gathering time of your school. We\u2019ll get you changed and help you wash your face. You\u2019re gonna have breakfast on the carriage.\u201dYin Tao pouted, \u201cBut I want to go to Nine Void Sect with daddy.\u201d\u201cLittle master, you are still not an official disciple of Nine Void Sect. You are not allowed in alone. So you have to go with other disciples of your school. Oh right, didn\u2019t you say your senior brothers are coming to hang out with you? You can invite them after the sect competition.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dQi Lan directly walked into the room and held Yin Tao out, saying to Yin Jinye, \u201cJinye, your son is really cute. Lend him to me for some fun.\u201dYin Jinye narrowed his eyes.Xinghe and Lei Sai quickly ran forward, \u201cChilde Qi, the little master is not for fun.\u201d\u201cNot for fun? Then why would you give birth to him?\u201d Speaking of which, Qi Lan threw the kid in the air. And Yin Tao was like a cuju (an Ancient Chinese game, like the football nowadays.) being kicked high into the sky.Everybody screamed like their hearts would bump out of their chests.While Yin Taoi was giggling\u2026 He didn\u2019t stop until it was about 300 meters high, and then he was in free fall fast.In the split second he was about to hit the ground, Qi Shiyue shouted anxiously, \u201cHe is falling down onto the ground. Catch him! Catch little Cherry! Come on! Hurry!\u201dLei Sai then sprung to his feet.But Qi Lan was one step ahead to catch the kid. Watching the kid who was still giggling, he asked, \u201cIs it fun?\u201dYin Tao nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dThe crowd, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis damn kid! They were all nearly scared to death while he said it was fun?!\u201cJinye, your son is pretty fun.\u201d Qi Lan then asked the kid wearing a smile, \u201cWhat about we try if you can drill into the ground?\u201dEverybody was stunned! How?Qi Lan then held the kid up and was about to smash him onto the ground.Zhong Ziqiao and others all panicked, \u201cNo! Stop it!\u201dIf so, the kid would definitely break into pieces like a watermelon falling onto the ground.Yin Jinye said coldly, \u201cQi Lan, enough is enough!\u201dQi Lan scanned Rong Yi and others, then curled up his lips, \u201cYou guys are so timid. This is already too much for you?\u201dYin Jinye then held the kid up.\u201cIt looks you really care about him.\u201d Qi Lan grinned, then took out a stick-shape golden magic weapon and handed it over to Yin Tao, \u201cMy little nephew, this is my gift for you.\u201dYin Tao then took it happily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why in such a hurry?\u201dRong Yi stared at the little magic weapon and narrowed his eyes, \u201cLittle Cherry, you are holding it upside down.\u201dQi Lan then gave him a meaningful look.Yin Tao then reversed it listening to daddy.Rong Yi then said, \u201cYou hold its bottom and screw it to the left for three rounds.\u201dLeft? Which is left? After thinking for a while lowering his head, Yin Tao screwed it to the left.After watching him do it, Rong Yi asked Yin Tao to activate it using his spiritual power.Suddenly, bam! The magic weapon ejected a red dazzling light into the sky. When it came to a certain height, it exploded again and the red dazzling light turned into some beautiful flowers.Yin Tao looked up into the sky, gasping in admiration, \u201cwow!\u201dQi Lan then asked him with a smile, \u201cSpiritual flowers, you like them?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThen you should put it away.

So I have refined a none-level magic weapon for you.\u201dRong Yi took a glance of it and then accepted, saying with a polite smile, \u201cThank you then.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you open it for a look?\u201dSeeing his provoking eyes, Rong Yi narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of rude to open the gift in front of the giver. I think I better open it when I am alone. By the way, I also have a gift for you, senior brother.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Lan was curious, \u201cWhat gift?\u201dWhen he had hardly finished his words, Rong Yi\u2019s left palm which was holding the gift gave off some aubergine light.Everyone was looking at him curiously.Qi Yueshi and others were all surprised, \u201cLittle Yiyi has spiritual powers?\u201dRong Yi quickly turned the box on the other side. He put it away in his Storage Ring and then took it out, and it looked like a whole new gift.He then gave it to Qi Lan, \u201cSenior brother, some humble gift. Hope you\u2019d like it.\u201dQi Lan raised his eyebrows. Isn\u2019t it the gift box he just sent to him?But the thing was some kind of strange rune was engraved on the gift box.Rong Yi smiled, \u201cSenior brother, won\u2019t you open it to take a look?\u201dQi Lan smiled, \u201cYou send me a gift using the my gift box. Isn\u2019t it too perfunctory?\u201d\u201cAre you sure it is still your gift box?\u201d Some kind of mocking feeling flashed in Rong Yi\u2019s eyes, \u201cOr you dare not open it?\u201dQi Lan narrowed his eyes. How dare he despise me? He smiled lightly and said, \u201cThank you then.\u201dHe had refined this box himself. No one was clearer of its inside. He just didn\u2019t believe Rong Yi could trick him in front of his face.Qi Lan then said to Rong Yi, \u201cThen I\u2019m gonna open it.\u201d\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Rong Yi then changed another position to hold the kid, so the kid\u2019s eyes would look in another direction.Noticing Rong Yi\u2019s action, Yin Jinye also slightly lowered his eyes.Qi Lan very confidently opened the box, then inside it shot a stunning strong light. In a spit second, he lost his sight and could not see those people and things around, and even his spiritual power was losing fast. He only felt itchy all over, even his eyes, throat and heart. He had a spur to scratch his whole body to stop it.Fortunately he had strong enough willpower, but still he couldn\u2019t help scratching palm lightly. The more he scratched, the itchier.\u201cSenior brother, are you all right?\u201dHearing the voice of Rong Yi, Qi Lan made a pause of what he was doing and he slowly regained his sight and people and scenery leaped to his eyes again, then he saw that Xinghe and Qi Yueshi and others were all looking at him, trying very hard to hold their laughing.This was the first time Xinghe, Leisai and others saw Qi Lan so embarrassed since the day they had known him. In the past, they would only be bullied by him. Since none of them was his rival, they could only hide away on seeing him every time.Yin Jinye curled up his lips slightly, \u201cSenior brother, please pay attention to your manner.\u201dQi Lan looked down, as if having been raped or what, with mess dress, his tough chest totally exposed. The only thing he didn\u2019t do was taking off his pants and let others appreciate his man part.Zhong Ziqiao whispered to Qi Yueshi and others, \u201cHe has a prettier face than a woman, but his body is no worse than Yiyi\u2019s hubby. What a surprise!\u201dQi Lan then looked at Rong Yi, looking quite embarrassed. But soon he regained his lazy and arrogant poseur and said with a faking smile, \u201cYour big \u2018gift\u2019 accepted and I will keep it in mind.\u201dYin Jinye said to Rong Yi, \u201cTake the kid in and get him changed.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dRong Yi then went back in the room holding Yin Tao, while Lei Sai and Qi Yueshi and others all followed in.After closing the door, Xinghe immediately asked out of curiosity, \u201cYoung master, what did you do to him?\u201dThey only saw a white light, and soon Qi Lan scratched his own body like crazy. Logically speaking, even if Rong Yi had spiritual power, he couldn\u2019t do anything on Qi Lan who was at a much higher level. But the truth was Qi Lan indeed got tricked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone was looking at Rong Yi curiously.Rong Yi simply explained, \u201cI just enchanted the magic weapon first, then engraved the rune that could give off blinding light and illusion rune that could make people feel deadly itchy. For those with high levels, how strong his spiritual power is, he could never expose his eyes under the blinding light. And the illusion rune also plays its part. Unless he doesn\u2019t look at it, or he\u2019d never avoid it. But the most important thing is Qi Lan is too confident of himself. He thought that as a man who has much lower cultivation than him, couldn\u2019t play any trick before him.\u201dHe was at a low level and really could not play any big tricks. If Qi Lan hadn\u2019t provoked him from the beginning, he also wouldn\u2019t fight back at someone at a much higher level, because it was like asking for death.Lei Sai said with a low voice, \u201cWell done!\u201dIt was a little trick, but he already felt much comfortable as long as Rong Yi could embarrass Qi Lan. Actually he had long wanted to teach Qi Lan a lesson, pity that he was not the other party\u2019s rival.Rong Yi then said to Xinghe, \u201cIt seems you are all afraid of him?\u201dLei Sai\u2019s face sank, \u201cYou know, every time he saw us, he would prank on every one of us. Plus we are not his match. So we could only take it. Most of the guards have died in his hands before.\u201dRong Yi was a little confused, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t your lord stop him?\u201dXinghe heaved a sigh, \u201cWhole Yin Family owes him.\u201dOnly five words, but they included all kinds of helplessness.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dNotice the atmosphere was a bit frozen, Qi Yueshi raised his soft fist and thumped on Rong Yi\u2019s shoulder, \u201cLittle Yiyi, do you even take us as your best friends? Why don\u2019t you tell us you have spiritual power now? You know, we were all worried that you may get bullied, so we have even prepared defending armor for you.\u201dThe corner of Rong Yi\u2019s eyes twitched. Does every sissy pants like thumping people with their pink fists? \u201cI have just gained cultivation recently.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYou can ask Lei Sai and others if I lied to you.\u201dLei Sai then explained, \u201cIt is true that our young master has started to cultivate recently.\u201dQi Yueshi then let it go, and took out a light blue robe he had made with his own hands and a pair of light blue boots to ask Rong Yi to change, \u201cThis is the robes we have especially refined for you and Little Cherry. We have embroidered the defending formation and rune inside it, as thanking gift for borrowing the spiritual stones to open the shop. For the record, it can only resist the attacks from cultivators of Qi Practicing.\u201d\u201cThank you. You are so thoughtful.\u201d Rong Yi was quite moved. In his own modern world, those so-called \u2018friends\u2019 wouldn\u2019t prepare anything for him when he had taken part in any competition.\u201cWe thought since you got no spiritual power, so we have made you only none-level robes.\u201d Zhong Ziqiao then signaled him to get up, \u201cWhat do you say?\u201dXinghe who was standing aside praised, \u201cPretty good.\u201dReally pretty good!Zhong Ziqiao and his friends were so considerate. The robe was simple, neat and elegant. And when Rong Yi who had such a pretty face wore it, he looked like a god! Besides, the robe could also cover his bulged belly, making it look much smaller.Rong Yi waved his arms to see whether the robe was tight or not, \u201cIt suits me perfectly, and it\u2019s comfortable. The most important thing is the belt shares the weight of my belly. So when I walk, I don\u2019t have to hold my waist or support my belly anymore. I like it very much.\u201dXinghe then took out a bag of spiritual stones, \u201cSince you like, please make some more for our young master, including the robes of winter, and also our lord and little master\u2019s.\u201dTang Shangru knew he was saving Rong Yi\u2019s face, so he also didn\u2019t stand on ceremony, saying smilingly, \u201cSo this is the first income of our shop?\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cWhen does your shop open?\u201d\u201cWe will open after the competition of Nine Void Sect is over. You can come visit our shop if you are available. Oh right, if anyone asks where you have made those robes, please you tell them it\u2019s from the garment shop in Eastwood Street.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dLei Sai said sullenly, \u201cSeeing your dressings, people are already bold enough not to run away, let alone get into your shop.\u201dHis words immediately invaded Qi Yueshi and others\u2019 disapproving, \u201cHow could you say that? How dare you\u2026\u201dThe corner of Lei Sai\u2019s eyes twitched a bit.Xinghe then laughed, \u201cLei Sai, don\u2019t be so bitchy.\u201d\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201dRong Yi also thought they should change some other outfits.Tang Shangru was also clear their dressing would make people feel uncomfortable, \u201cAfter the opening, we wouldn\u2019t dress up like women.\u201dYi Yueshi then pressed Rong Yi into the chair, \u201cLet me do up your hair.\u201dRong Yi looked at Qi Yueshi through the bronze mirror on the table, \u201cOh, shouldn\u2019t I wear the sect robe to attend the tests of Nine Void Sect?\u201dQi Yueshi grinned, \u201cDo you think you can still fit in the robes you have worn four years ago? Hum, Nine Void Sect doesn\u2019t take you as their disciple at all. You have left the sect for such a long time, they even didn\u2019t send someone to pay a visit to show some care at least, or prepare your some new clothes. On the contrary, every time they met you, they would only mock you. And after every annual sect competition, you would end up with a bloody nose and a swollen face, which shows you got bullied there apparently.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo the original owner has led such a miserable life?Zhu Xinyu then picked up the conversation, \u201cIf you fail the test this time, you\u2019ll have to be expelled from Nine Void Sect. Anyway you hubby is back. You can stay at home and serve him and bring up your children.Serve the husband and bring up the children\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if he had to leave Nine Void Sect, that was the last thing he would do.Qi Yueshi tied up his hair for Rong Yi, then tied it with a hair band of the same color of his robe. Then he turned to Zhu Xinyu and others and said, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Get little Cherry changed with the robe we have made for him!\u201d\u201cOh, OK.\u201d Zhu Xinyu then held the kid and put him on bed, \u201cLittle Cheery, be good. Let Aunt Yu get you changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOn hearing a man calling himself aunt, Xinghe and Lei Sai were both feeling like getting struck by the lightning.Qi Yueshi then whispered by Rong Yi\u2019s ear, \u201cLittle Yiyi, that person just now is not so easy to tackle with. You should be careful and let your son stay away from him. I don\u2019t think he would show mercy even on kids.\u201dOn thinking the scene the kid was thrown into the air, he still felt his heart fluttering with fear. If Lei Sai hadn\u2019t lent a hand, Qi Lan would have let the kid drop onto the ground for sure.Rong Yi nodded, \u201cHmm, I know.\u201dHe then stood up and took the magic weapon from Yin Tao\u2019s hand, \u201cI will keep this magic weapon for you.\u201dZhong Ziqiao looked at it and asked, \u201cI saw that you all looked nervous about it? Is it really so powerful?\u201d\u201cIt is a toy magic weapon. At the bottom it is a toy, but on the other side it is a lethal magic weapon. Just now I let little Cherry turn it to left three rounds, that is to shut down the magic weapon. And if activating it with spiritual power, it\u2019d explode. Cultivator below Base Practicing level would be hurt by the spiritual wave. And the closer the more severe, one would even get his own dantian destroyed.\u201d Rong Yi\u2019s little brothers had such similar magic weapons, but got refitted, so they wouldn\u2019t get hurt when they used it.Xinghe and Lei Sai\u2019s faces both sank. Qi Lan even wouldn\u2019t let go of an innocent child!Tang Shangru cried, \u201cOh my god! He is so horrible!\u201d\u201cDone!\u201d Zhu Xinyu then held up the kid and kissed on his face, \u201cOur Little Cherry is so pretty.\u201dLooking at Yin Tao\u2019s dress, Lei Sai nodded satisfactorily.Those sissy pants really knew how to get the kid dressed. Unlike rough men them, they only knew wrapped the kid with clothes made of expensive cloth, and never cared about whether it fitted him or not, only if they could make the little master and look noble and wouldn\u2019t be laughed at.The more he looked at Yin Tao\u2019s dress, the more satisfied Lei Sai felt. Suddenly he felt that Yi Yueshi and his friends were not so annoying now.Zhu Xinyu then put the kid in Rong Yi\u2019s arms and said with a smile, \u201cYou are indeed father and son. He is like a replica of you, especially when you two wear the same dresses.\u201dIf they went out together, they\u2019d definitely attract all disciples\u2019 eyes and their shop would also be much popular.Rong Yi lowered his head and looked at his and Yin Tao\u2019s clothes, asking casually, \u201cAre we wearing parent-child dress?\u201d\u201cParent-child dress?\u201d Qi Yueshi and others looked at him, confused.Rong Yi then explained, \u201cIt means father and son wear clothes of the same style.\u201dTang Shangru\u2019s eyes were beaming, \u201cLittle Yiyi\u2019s words enlighten me! In the future we can also make father-son dresses, mother-son dresses, father-daughter dresses, mother-daughter dresses, or even the same style for the whole family. And I bet we will attract a lot of customers.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat a smart brain!Qi Yueshi and others all echoed, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. After our shop opens, we\u2019ll let little Yiyi and little Cherry wear the robes we make to attract the customers.\u201dXinghe held up Yin Tao and interrupted their conversation, \u201cit\u2019s late. We should go to Haishan Academy now.\u201d\u201cHmm. Little Yiyi, show your hubby your new look! Come on!\u201d Qi Yueshi and others pushed Rong Yi to the door.After Rong Yi and others went out of the room, Yin Jinye and Qi Lan were still standing there. The former was looking in the direction of Rong Yi\u2019s room, while the latter was staring at the former. Though the two of them didn\u2019t say a word, judging from Qi Lan\u2019s expression, Rong Yi could tell they were using ventriloquism.Yin Jin saw that Rong Yi became more graceful and more elegant after getting changed and his eyes was beaming. He then moved to Rong Yi actively for the first time.Qi Lan immediately asked him through ventriloquism, \u201cHave you fallen for him?\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t answer him.Qi Yueshi and others smiled covering the mouths, \u201cLittle Cherry\u2019s father, isn\u2019t our little Yiyi very pretty today?\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at them, \u201cHow could you use the word pretty to describe a man?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t we? Any laws or regulations against it?\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t want to argue with them, so he turned to Yin Jinye, \u201cIt\u2019s not early. I should go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send you to Nine Void Sect.\u201d Yin Jinye stretched out a hand.Rong Yi was a bit stunned and then involuntarily put his hand in his palm.Zhong Ziqiao and others all looked at them, drooling, feeling jealous.Yin Jinye then walked to the gate holding Rong Yi\u2019s hand.Rong Yi cast a glance at Qi Lan who was behind, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you inform your senior brother?\u201dYin Jinye said flatly, \u201cWen Chuan.\u201dThe next second Wen Chuan already showed up before them.\u201cSee the guest out.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wen Chuan then walked before Qi Lan, \u201cChilde Qi, please.\u201dQi Lan then walked by Yin Jinye and Rong Yi\u2019s side, still wearing that smile, \u201cWon\u2019t you really let me stay?\u201dYin Jinye said, \u201cSee you.\u201dQi Lan smiled gently, giving Rong Yi a meaningful look.Rong Yi looked at his back, eyes narrowed.Qi Yueshi and others walked to the gate of Yin Mansion and said goodbye to Rong Yi.Rong Yi saw the wheeler Bu Qi who was also wearing robes of Nine Void Sect, eyebrows raised, \u201cAre you also disciple of Nine Void Sect?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Bu Qi felt his robes were a little uncomfortable, so he dragged a corner to adjust it.Rong Yi looked at the mask on his face, \u201cDo you wear that mask every day?\u201d\u201cYeah, getting used to it.\u201d Bu Qi jumped off the carriage, and signaled Rong Yi to get onto the cart, \u201cPlease get into the carriage.\u201dRong Yi then stepped onto the box step.\u201cYoung master, we have put all your stuff on the cart. Remember to put them away in your Space Ring.\u201d Su Rong came out and jumped onto the top of the carriage and went together with them.\u201cOK.\u201d After getting into the cart, Rong Yi put those medicine and equipment Rong Su had prepared for them a few days ago in his Space Ring.\u201cIf Qi Lan ever comes to our mansion again, just ignore him.\u201d Yin Jinye who came after him suddenly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to entertain him, or stay alone with him, or accept his invitation to his place.\u201dRong Yi frowned, \u201cDo you mean he would do harm to us?\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t answer him, indicating he approved his question.Rong Su who was sitting on the roof said, \u201cAnything the lord cares or likes, or anything that belongs to the lord, Childe Qi would destroy them all.\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cWill he also do harm to little Cherry?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe carriage then jumped into the air and flew towards Nine Void Sect at the fastest speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNine Void Sect lied among the mountains in the rear of Haishan City, which was covered by the clouds. So those down the hill could not appreciate its magnificence.Rong Yi brushed aside the curtain out of curiosity. At the foot of the rolling green mountains, one piled upon another, some towering into the clouds, some wriggling far away, some like flying dragons, some like lying cattle, endless postures, like the waves of the sea, endless extension to the far end of the sky.Many cultivators passed by their cart flying on the swords. Some wore robes of Nine Void Sect, some wore robes of other sects. They either talked about cultivation or bragged whose sect was more powerful. Unwittingly, they had arrived at the gate of Nine Void Sect.Bu Qi then stopped the carriage at a corner, \u201cMaster shifu, we are arrived.\u201d\u201cWe are all disciples of Nine Void Sect. Isn\u2019t it inappropriate to call me master shifu?\u201d Rong Yi walked outside the carriage while saying so. Yin Jinye then said, \u201cWait.\u201dRong Yi turned around, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dYin Jinye took off the jade pendant around his waist, \u201cPut it on.\u201dRong Yi noticed it was sending off some kind of light spiritual qi, he then said with a smile, \u201cYou put it on for me.\u201dSeeing that he was bearing that big belly and his hand couldn\u2019t even reach the other side, Yin Jinye then moved to his side and wore it around his waist for him, \u201cIf you meet any danger, it can save your life.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Rong Yi lowered his head and looked at Yin Jinye. Looking from a high angle, he found that Yin Jinye\u2019s eyelashes were thick and long, very beautiful especially when he blinked.Yin Jinye then looked up to him, \u201cWe will wait for you here.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dRong Su, who was standing outside, saw that their faces were very close through the gap of the curtain. His eyes shone and he then pushed Rong Yi who was close to the curtain a little hard while crying, \u201cThe young master is here.\u201dIt was already not very easy for Rong Yi to keep stable on the cart, now he leaned forward and immediately pressed his lips against Yin Jinye\u2019s cold lips.Both sides were stunned.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not on purpose.\u201d Rong Yi instantly straightened up, but forgot he was standing on the cart, then his head hit the roof and then got bounced back, and his lips again kissed on Yin Jinye, but this time, it was Yin Jinye\u2019s face.He hurriedly raised his head and forced a smile, \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean it, I swear.\u201dYin Jinye curled up his lip and supported him to get off.Rong Yi glared at Rong Su.And Rong Su looked at him innocently, \u201cYoung master, why are you staring at me?\u201dOf course Rong Yi knew he pushed him on purpose, so Rong Yi said grumpily, \u201cYou got gum in the eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRong Su touched the corner of his eyes, \u201cNo.\u201dRong Yi then turned around and elbowed into the crowd with Bu Qi.Yin Jin watched him leave while touching his lips that got kissed, \u201cThey are soft.\u201dRong Yi who had already walked far away turned back. The carriage was already out of sight. He also subconsciously touched his own lips and muttered to himself, \u201cCould a man\u2019s lips be so soft?\u201dBesides, he also smelled some kind of light scent of plum blossom on Yin Jinye\u2019s face, so refreshing, unlike the thick perfume modern women wore, which was pungent and would make him sneeze.Bu Qi heard him, and answered promptly, \u201cNot soft at all.\u201dRong Yi looked at Bu Qi, \u201cHave you also kissed a man before? Or are you saying your own lips are hard?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve ever kissed a man.\u201d\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cImmortal Yunyi.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c!!!!!!\u201dHe really couldn\u2019t imagine why Bu Qi would have kissed an old man who had already half stepped into his own coffin.Bu Qi stopped, \u201cMaster shifu, I got something to do. You go in first.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Rong Yi then took out the token Rong Su had given him and showed it to the guarding disciples outside the gate.As they saw it was the token of Nine Void Sect, they immediately let him in.Rong Yi looked back at the direction of Bu Qi leaving the moment he entered the gate. He saw a disciple walk aside with him and Bu Qi quickly lifted the mask to show his face to that disciple.When the disciple saw his face, he was both frightened and respectful, so he hurriedly invited him in without taking off the mask to examine his face.After Bu Qi came in, he instantly spotted Rong Yi and then trotted toward him, \u201cMaster shifu, sorry to keep you waiting.\u201dRong Yi thought Bu Qi\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t simple, but he was not interested in who he was, \u201cYou own Thunder-fire Spiritual Root, right? What level of magic weapon maker are you?\u201d\u201cSeven.\u201d\u201cThat is enough.\u201dBu Qi was confused, \u201cWhat do you mean by enough?\u201dRong Yi didn\u2019t explain, instead, he took out a white paper and handed it to Bu Qi, \u201cNow I got you a task. You engrave a rune using your thunder-fire arts without tearing it.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of rune?\u201d\u201cAnyone kind would be fine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When you do it without burning it, I will teach you other stuff.\u201dBu Qi was excited, eyes beaming, \u201cMaster shifu, will you teach me enchanting arts?\u201d\u201cStill those words. When you learn how to enchant without burning it, I will teach you other stuff.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Bu Qi immediately started to try. But the moment the fire flaring up in his hand, pfff, the paper turned into ashes. Fortunately he got enough papers in his Storage Ring. He hurriedly took them out and kept trying.Rong Yi looked at pieces of white paper burned, he held his laughing and turned to look elsewhere. When came in, he was occupied with the thinking of kissing Yin Jinye\u2019s lips, so he didn\u2019t even notice the magnificence of the gate. Now taking a broad view, he realized why Nine Void Sect would be rendered as the number one sect of Zhonghai Prefecture.The place where he was standing now was a huge square, which would make people feel how small they were. In the middle of the square, there was a huge brass tripod about a hundred feet high, with light fragrance coming out of it now and then, which could make people feel quite refreshing.At the end of the square there were nine large stone bridges, set on top of the square and other peaks, through which one can reach all the other \u00a0peaks and temples. And in the clear sky, there were cranes hovering, making some melodious sound.At this moment, Rong Yi felt so luck that he had transmigrated into this cultivation world, or he was gonna miss the opportunity to appreciate such a big cultivation sect.While gasping in admiration, he took a few deep mouthful of spiritual qi! Really worthy to be rendered as a big cultivation sect. Only a square was much bigger that a whole small sect in modern world.Rong Yi then turned around and asked Bu Qi who was still burning papers, \u201cWhere do I take the tests?\u201d\u201cWhen it is time, all disciples would gather at the competition area. And then those newly recruited disciples and their master shifus would have a tests here.\u201d Bu Qi wouldn\u2019t give up and took out another white paper.\u201cWhat about you? Don\u2019t you have to compete?\u201d\u201cNo, I am here as your company.\u201dRong Yi looked around, feeling kind of dull, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a competition within Nine Void Sect? Why are there disciples from other sects?\u201d\u201cWhen any sect is having an internal test, other sects would send a patch of disciples to see whose disciple are more capable.\u201dAt this time, the bell came from the high mountains from afar.Then those disciples on the square immediately flew their swords towards the competition area.There were also many carriages in the sky, some of which were driven by coachmen dressed in the guard\u2019s robes of Hishan Academy representing those sitting inside were disciples of Haishan Academy, who also followed other disciples to the competition field.Rong Yi sighed, \u201cAlas! I am even lamer than my son.\u201dEven Yin Tao could go to the competition field himself. As his daddy, Rong Yi had to stay here waiting for the test.As the disciples all left, the square became desolate, only some cultivators who didn\u2019t wear robes of Nine Void Sect left.They became very tense and no one dare to say a word.After quite some time, someone flew over the square on a crane.Someone called, \u201cHere comes an immortal! Everybody line up!\u201dRong Yi saw the person on the crane then said with eyebrows raised, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Jin Tong?\u201dBu Qi cast a glance at him and said, \u201cHis dantian has been ruined, so the chief has sent him here to supervise the newly recruited disciples.\u201dRong Yi snorted lightly, \u201cImmortal Yunyi has promised to punish him, but now he is still in whole piece and even got an easy job.\u201d\u201cOf course he got punished. Once he came back, Immortal Yunyi has removed his name and even gave him a hundred pranks a few days ago.\u201dFor common people, a hundred pranks might have killed him. But Jin Tong\u2019s dad had let him taken the elixir secretly in advance, otherwise he would have already gone to say hi to King of Hell.Those newly recruited disciples all looked at Jin Tong riding the crane with jealousy.The crane stopped in front of them. Jin Tong, who was injured, stumbled as he came down and almost fell to the ground. Fortunately everyone was focused on the crane. But even if they saw it, no one dared to laugh at him.Jin Tong pulled a long face and sulked, \u201cAll stand by!\u201dSome smart disciples immediately greeted Jin Tong, \u201cMy greetings.\u201dOthers all echoed.Jin Tong looked a bit eased since they all showed him some respect.Rong Yi sneered. Dantian destroyed and he could still hang in there.The one who was reasonable for the recruiting work handed three pamphlets to Jin Tong, \u201cSupervisor Jin, this is the list of the disciples we have recruited this year.\u201dJin Tong took the one on top and casually turned to a page and the first name he saw was Rong Yi, he immediately whispered to the disciple beside him, \u201cRong Yi? Is it the son of the chief of Tianxu Peak?\u201dThe disciple said with a mocking tone, \u201cWho else could it be? Every year he would come for the test. Oh right, Aunt Jin has issued an order. If he comes, don\u2019t let him go.\u201d\u201cAunt Jin? You mean my aunt Jin Yueyao?\u201d Jin Tong knew that his aunt liked Rong Yi\u2019s senior brother Bai Yunchen, but because of Rong Yi standing in the way, Bai Yunchen was always cold to Jin Yueyao, so Jin Yuetyao hated Rong Yi to the bones.\u201cExactly.\u201dJin Tong showed a flash of maliciousness, \u201cWhat the fuck! I\u2019m gonna send him to hell today!\u201dHe inquired about the fact that Immortal Yunyi went to Haishan Academy with Rong Yi. He thought that it was Rong Yi who told Immortal Yunyi about Yin Tao, and Yunyi would kick him out of the sect and even gave him a hundred pranks!It was all because of Rong Yi and Yin Tao. If it hadn\u2019t been for them, his dantian would not have been crushed by some ghost cultivators on the way back to Nine Void Sect.On thinking of this, Jin Tong gritted his teeth, \u201cRong Yi, it\u2019s your turn!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I heard you are totally wasted since your dantian got ruined\u2026\u201dHis words immediately aroused Jin Tong\u2019s hatred, and his eyes immediately turned red, just like the devil who wanted to eat people, and his eyes were about to protrude out of the sockets.\u201dRong Yi, don\u2019t talk nonsense\u2026\u201dThis thing has clearly been locked up, and he can continue to pretend to be a normal person with cultivation, but why Rong Yi knew now? Did Immortal Yunyi tell him?Those newly recruited disciples were mostly kids. On seeing Jin Tong\u2019s twisted face, they were all frightened and backed a few steps subconsciously.The disciple who was responsible for the recruiting work was stunned. They had been busy with the recruitment job everywhere, and didn\u2019t know Jin Tong had got his dantian destroyed. Even those within the sect didn\u2019t know about it. After all Jin Tong was the grand grandson of the chief. Of course they had already concealed it.Looking at those bewildered disciples, Rong Yi knew the news was concealed, so he said with an innocent tone, \u201cI am not talking nonsense. I am caring about you. I also heard that Immortal Yunyi has removed your name and punished you. I also feel sorry on hearing it. Anyway you were my son\u2019s senior brother. Oh right, I got a pill here which might help with the injuries on your butt. Please accept it.\u201dHe then took out a small pill and handed it to Jin Tong.\u201cIf you keep talking nonsense, I will expel you out of Nine Void Sect!\u201d Jin Tong brushed off his pill and turned to the disciples who were responsible for the recruitment work, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He said that only because he is jealous of me.\u201dBut his twisted face was not persuasive at all. Besides, if he wanted to prove the other party was really talking nonsense, he only needed to use his spiritual power to prove himself. He didn\u2019t need to shout at all, which made him lose his grace.Those disciples responsible for the recruitment work then looked at each other, wearing kind of weird expression on their faces.Rong Yi looked at him, \u201cWho would be jealous of someone who got his dantian damaged?\u201d\u201cRong Yi, I don\u2019t think you are gonna stay in the sect anymore\u2026\u201d Jin Tong turned over the pamphlet and then used the brush with red ink to removed Rong Yi\u2019s name, suddenly a hand covered Rong Yi\u2019s name.Everyone was stunned and looked at the woman who suddenly flew her sword here. She was wearing the robe of Nine Void Sect glaring at Jin Tong, \u201cWho allowed you to remove Rong Yi\u2019s name without authorization? Even if he fails, before my big brother comes back, no one can remove his name, including the chief.\u201dRong Yi felt pitiful. He almost got his name removed.\u201cGreetings, Deacon Rong.\u201d Those disciples who were responsible for the recruitment quickly saluted to her. Even Jin Tong restrained his anger and said, \u201cDeacon Rong, the chief said if Rong Yi fails again, he would be expelled out of the sect.\u201dRong Yuanyin even didn\u2019t want to talk with those juniors. She turned to Rong Yi and sulked, \u201cYou useless thing! You can\u2019t even fix disciples with lower position. What can you do? Huh? You\u2019ll only lose our face. And because of you, my niece Xiao\u2019er still hasn\u2019t found a mate for dual cultivation. They are all worried that they\u2019d give birth to such losers like you!\u201dThrough her words, Rong Yi could tell she should be the original owner\u2019s aunt. He thought she would speak for him. But it turned out he thought too much. Otherwise the original owner wouldn\u2019t gotten beaten so badly during the test every time as Qi Yueshi and others said.\u201cTest first!\u201d Rong Yuanyin held his hand and said to those disciples who were responsible for the recruitment, \u201cGet me the crystal stone.\u201dOne disciple then carried a prismatic transparent crystal stone in front of Rong Yi.Rong Yuanyin then pressed one of Rong Yi\u2019s hands on the crystal stone. After a few seconds, the crystal stone showed a piece of chaos. There was no colorful light shining, which meant that Rong Yi was someone with no spiritual root.All the disciples showed contempt expression, even those newly recruited disciples looked at him with disdain. It\u2019d only bring shame to the Nine Void Sect to let him stay.\u201cHum, the results are the same every year. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the point of coming here every year?\u201dRong Yuanyin tossed off Rong Yi\u2019s hand which got grabbed by another hand the next second.Rongyi looked back and saw that the person holding his hand was Bu Qi who had come with him.\u201cIt would be more accurate to test with Hundred\u2013colored-Bead.\u201d Bu Qi then put Rong Yi\u2019s hand on a big bead what was giving off all kinds of colors.Hundred\u2013color Bead was the pearl that cost the Clam Demon five thousand years to breed, which was extremely hard to obtain. It not only was a kind of nine level medicinal materials, but also could be used to accurately test the spiritual roots and levels of the cultivators.It was very fast to show the result. Once Rong Yi\u2019s hand was pressed on it, it immediately glittered with some kind of aubergine light. But it was a bit dark, indicating that this person\u2019s level was not very high.Rong Yuanyin, Jin Tong and others all couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. The Hundred\u2013color Bead was giving off aubergine light, which meant that not only Rong Yi owned his spiritual root, but also it was the mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root, because only mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root would give off aubergine light.Rongyi quickly pulled back his hand before it showed any color of his other spiritual roots. He then said grumpily, \u201cAre you here to set me up?\u201dBu Qi said to him using mouth shape, \u201cImmortal Yunyi told me to do so. He doesn\u2019t want you to leave the Sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After having known that Rong Yi had no spiritual root, he thought it was quite weird, because he had seen him using his spiritual power to enchant. It was impossible that he had no spiritual root. The reason it didn\u2019t test out he owned spiritual root was because his was recessive root. Plus Immortal Yunyi also got to know those disciples of Nine Void Sect all gave Rong Yi their attitude but Rong Yi still wouldn\u2019t show them he owned spiritual power, so he guessed Rong Yi might plan to leave the Sect, so he specially found the Hundred\u2013color Bead to do test for Rong Yi.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThat old fox! Why would he set me up from time to time?Seeing Rong Yi looked a little annoyed, Bu Qi immediately explained using mouth shape, \u201cImmortal Yunyi said this is the last time.\u201dRong Yi snorted.\u201cNo way.\u201d Jin Tong flared up, \u201cIt\u2019s false. It must be false. This Hundred\u2013color Bead must be a fake one!\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe someone who had no spiritual root in the last 18 years would suddenly have it.Rong Yuanyin also thought it impossible. She quickly got him checked again. But the thick spiritual qi still told her it couldn\u2019t be truer.\u201cThunder-fire Spiritual Root! It\u2019s mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root!\u201dThunder-fire Spiritual Root could be used to refine magic weapons, equipment and elixirs, and played great importance in a lot of other things. Besides, the one who owned the Thunder-fire Spiritual Root\u2019s power was lethal and that person\u2019s cultivation speed would be very fast. Although Rong Yi was only 18 years old, he could catch up with those who had cultivated ten years earlier in only a few years\u2019 time.Rong Yuanyin\u2019s face turned slightly pale. She had already forgotten why she came here. On thinking she had always mocked his talented big brother for giving birth to such a loser, she felt her face burning hot, like someone slapped right in her face hard.The most annoying thing was this loser\u2019s spiritual root was even better than her son\u2019s.\u201cYeah, Thunder-fire Spiritual Root.\u201d Bu Qi took over the pamphlet from Jin Tong\u2019s hand and handed it to some other disciple, \u201cRecord it.\u201d\u201cOh, oh.\u201d The disciple suddenly came to his sense.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d After Jin Tong came to his sense, he pounced at the disciple but got kicked dozens of meters away by Bu Qi.Jin Tong who had already turned into a mortal passed out on site.Then the disciple quickly wrote it on and turned to Rong Yi, \u201cWell\u2026\u201dHe said hesitantly, \u201cUncle\u2026uncle Rong, your senior brother\u2026uncle Bai is waiting for you in Jinlin Yard. He asks you to see him after the test.Rong Yi looked at him.His sharp eyes made that disciple look away because he felt guilty. Actually it was Jin Yueyao who had asked to say so to trick him to go to Jinlin Yard. As for what would happen next, it was not his concern.\u201cThank you.\u201d Rong Yi smiled at him and then turned around and walked to the nine bridges on the square.After coming by the bridges, Rong Yi asked Bu Qi, \u201cWhich bridge should I take?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you go to Jinlin Yard?\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him. Apparently that disciple was tricking him to go there. Of course he would never fall for it. \u201cNow I only want to see how the competition goes.\u201d\u201cOK. The competition site is over there.\u201d Bu Qi pointed at the direction those cultivators flew to, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit far. I will take you there.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter they left, Rong Yuanyin came to her sense. Seeing that Rong Yi was gone, she sulked, \u201cWhere is Rong Yi?\u201dA disciple said, \u201cHe has gone.\u201d\u201cWhere did he go?\u201dThe disciple told him it was the competition site.Rong Yuanyin stamped on her feet. And then flew her sword eastward.Seeing his mother was here, Wei Wenxiao hurriedly asked, \u201cMother, have you found Rong Yi?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d On thinking of the test thing, Rong Yuanyin\u2019s face sank.\u201cDid you ask them where they have put Rong Weiyi\u2019s documents in his cave?\u201d\u201cHe is already gone when I was about to ask him.\u201dWei Wenxiao was surprised, \u201cDid you let him run away? It\u2019s weird. How could he run faster than you?\u201d\u201cXiao\u2019er, you know what, when I found him\u2026\u201d Rong Yuanyin then told Wei Wenxiao about the test result.\u201cHow is that possible?!\u201d Wei Wenxiao couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cMother, is it possible you made a mistake?\u201d\u201cSo many people were there. How could I make a mistake? Now some disciple has already recorded that he has spiritual root in the pamphlet. Within a day, everyone will know he owns mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root.\u201dWei Wenxiao asked, \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\u201cThey said he has come here.\u201dWei Wenxiao then showed a murderous look, \u201cMother, what about before everyone knows he owns spiritual root, we\u2026\u201dHe made a silence gesture at Rong Yuanyin. He was not like his mother who had been pressed under by his loser uncle for her whole life.Rong Yuanyin also didn\u2019t want his big brother\u2019s son better than her own son and let his son live under other\u2019s shadow.

I didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him crossly, \u201cThen tell me how a disciple from Nine Void Sect doesn\u2019t even know where the competition site is! What kind of disciple are you?\u201dAfter leaving the square, they had hovered over the sect for nearly an hour but still hadn\u2019t found the site. Then they asked a disciple but Bu Qi still didn\u2019t find it and on the contrary, they were flying even further away. Rong Yi even thought they were nearly flying out of the sect.Bu Qi asked, \u201cMaster shifu, aren\u2019t you also disciple of Nine Void Sect?\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you know where the competition ground is either?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Rong Yi found a random excuse, \u201cYou know my cultivation is bad and I can\u2019t fly a sword. I seldom had the chance to leave Tianxu Peak, of course it is reasonable I don\u2019t know which peal they are at now. Wait. let me ask you. Why are you asking me now?\u201dBu Qi then said awkwardly, \u201cI haven\u2019t gone back for years. If Immortal Yunyi hadn\u2019t come to me, maybe it may take another dozens of years for me to come back.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes. It was true he hadn\u2019t been back for a long time. He even couldn\u2019t remember which mountain the competition was held. \u201cBut we can\u2019t keep flying like this. We should ask some disciple to lead us the way.\u201d\u201cMaster shifu, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Bu Qi apologize to him.Rong Yi thought maybe it wasn\u2019t a bad thing they didn\u2019t get there, then he didn\u2019t have to see those relatives or disciples who looked down on him. Though he was not the original owner of this body, he could imagine how awful that kind of feeling could be. Alas! Thinking back that the way he looked at his second elder brother, he really should reflect on himself and shouldn\u2019t hurt his brother like that anymore, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. This trip isn\u2019t in vain. At least you let me enjoy those beautiful sceneries of Nine Void Sect and also appreciate how magnificent the Sect is.\u201d Nine Void Sect was as big as a city except that it didn\u2019t have so many people. But it had a lot of mountains and halls, which any of the modern cultivation sects could never compare.\u201dBu Qi then kept checking for another few peaks but still saw no one.Today was the first day of the competition. It was quite normal no one was in the hall, because almost all disciples had gathered on Jufeng Mountain, first to watch the combats, second, to get to see the chief and those elders of other sects, and also the head of all peaks. Those disciple only had the chance to see all of them on such big occasions.\u201cMaster shifu, I remember there is a Magic Weapon Peak ahead. Usually those magic weapon refiners and equipment forgers would cultivate there. There must be disciples guarding. Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201dRong Yi was OK with that. He took out some pastries out of his Storage Ring to stuff his belly. He felt like he was quite easy feeling hungry today. He was sure he just had breakfast on the carriage about two hours ago and now he already felt hungry.Bu Qi then brought him to the Magic Weapon Peak. Before they even drew near, the bustling sound was heard from above the peak.Rong Yi then looked over to the peak, \u201cThere seems a lot people out there.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Bu Qu flew the sword over the peak and looked down. Most of them were disciples of Nine Void Sect who were chattering about the magic weapon refining and equipment forging stuff in knots.Bu Qi then landed on Magic Weapon Peak, then asked a disciple curiously, \u201cWhat are you guys doing here instead of going to the competition site?\u201dThat disciple looked at him like looking at an idiot, \u201cWe are now here waiting for our magic weapons and equipment to compete.\u201dBu Qi was a bit confused, \u201cThere are even competitions of magic weapons and equipment?\u201dBut he remembered there was only competition of magic before.\u201cNot only that, there are even competitions of elixir refining, rune spells and formations. Others like feng shui and puppet making have few learners, so we don\u2019t have such competitions.\u201d That disciple sized him up, \u201cIt\u2019s been five years since those were separated to compete. How long haven\u2019t you come back?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed quite a long time.\u201d Bu Qi brought Rong Yi to a corner, \u201cMaster shifu, don\u2019t you also know those are separated to compete?\u201dRong Yi said, \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t been in the sect for recent years, besides, I am not qualified to take part in the competition at all, how would I know?\u201dBu Qi thought it was reasonable.The costumes of Haishan Academy some disciples were wearing reminded him of his little Yin Tao, \u201cBu Qi, come on, see if my son is also here.\u201dBu Qi had high cultivations, so his ears were quite sensitive. He soon heard kids giggling. Following the sound he then saw Yin Tao having fun with a bunch of other kids.He pointed at him and said, \u201cThere he is.\u201dRong Yi saw that Yin Tao was having fun with his little senior brothers, his lips also curled up subconsciously, but he didn\u2019t have the heart to go to disturb them.\u201cDuang\u2026Duang\u2026\u201d Some disciple struck the gong and shouted, \u201cThe competition begins!

Pity that there were disciples patrolling. No one was allowed to get close to them.Bu Qi then asked, \u201cMaster shifu, do you still want to go to the competition site?\u201d\u201cNah! I am a little tired. I need to find some place and take some rest.\u201d Rong Yi had stood on the flying sword for nearly two hours. Even if the belt could share part of the weight of his big belly, he still felt quite sour in the waist.Bu Qi remembered there was a shop selling cloth nearby, so he proposed, \u201cMaster shifu, there is a shop selling cloth not far from here. We can go there and have some rest.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dThe shop was run by an elder from the Nine Void Sect, so all disciples from the sect could deposit the ingredients they had collected here for sale, so one could almost find any ingredients he/she wanted here.On seeing Rong Yi and Bu Qi walk in, the disciple in the shop immediately moved forward to welcome them, \u201cWelcome, seniors, what would you like please?\u201dBu Qi said, \u201cWe are just here to take some rest.\u201dThe disciple pointed at the chairs on the opposite side, \u201cYou can take some rest there.\u201dAfter Rong Yi and Bu Qi sat down, they heard a female disciple whispering inside the counter, \u201cDid you hear? Uncle Bai has canceled the marriage with Taiyuan Sect.\u201dRong Yi couldn\u2019t help looking up towards them.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve also heard of it. But haven\u2019t they just gotten engaged?\u201d\u201cI am also not very clear about it. But I heard that after uncle Bai came back from visiting uncle Rong, he immediately sent a letter to Taiyuan Sect and canceled the marriage. I guess uncle Rong doesn\u2019t agree him marrying a woman.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t understand. Since uncle Rong likes uncle Bai, and uncle Bai really cares about him and listens to his words, why haven\u2019t they become a cultivation couple?\u201d\u201cNobody knows. Anyway, after this, Taiyuan Sect would hate uncle Rong to the bones, after all uncle Bai proposed to them due to uncle Rong. And now still because of uncle Rong, uncle Bai canceled the marriage. Taiyuan Sect wouldn\u2019t go easy on both of them. I heard that the elders from Taiyuan Sect have gone to confront our chief and ask for an explanation.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dIs uncle Rong they are mentioning him?Why would a misfortune dropped from heaven fall on his head and he had made a bunch of enemies from nowhere while he had been stayed in Yin Mansion and done nothing???\u201cAchoo!\u201d A male disciple beside said, \u201cYou are talking about uncle Bai this and uncle Bai that all day long. He is just a little bit handsome and a little bit outstanding. Do you really have to keep talking about him like this? Hum! Besides, he even wouldn\u2019t lay his eyes on none of you, idiots!\u201dRong Yi found this man so funny. Apparently he was jealous.The female disciple sulked, \u201cWe like talking about him. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cWe just enjoy talking about uncle Bai. So what?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t argue with you.\u201d He then carried a box of ingredients and put it on the counter, asking another disciple, \u201dSenior brother, what are these? How many spiritual stones are they worth?\u201dThat disciple gave that box a look and said, \u201cJust some Campsis Stones, cloddy. If anyone who wants them, ten low grade spiritual stones for a whole box.\u201dOn hearing it was Campsis Stones, Rong Yi picked up his ears and asked that disciple, \u201cWhat are these things?\u201cCampsis Stones.\u201d That disciple took out a piece of black stone giving off faint light, \u201cDo you want them?\u201dRong Yi\u2019s eyes were beaming. He stood up and walked over, then took it from that disciple and took a close look. It was really Campsis Stone!In modern world, some advanced magic weapons or when to enchant advanced magic weapons, one might need it. But just because of thst, the Campsis Stones less and less, meanwhile it made them become more and more precious. A thumb size Campsis Stone was worth a fairy level spiritual stone, sometimes one couldn\u2019t buy one even if he had the stone.Rong Yi asked at once, \u201cHow many spiritual stones does it need?\u201dThe disciple said, \u201cA box of low grade spiritual stones. Want it?\u201dRong Yi looked at that big box of Campris Stones, eyes beaming, \u201cSure. How many do you have?\u201dIf he could bring those Campris stones back to his modern world like his ancestors did, he would be super rich!\u201cI guess there are another 25 boxes upstairs. If you want them, we can carry them down for you.\u201d\u201cSure. I want them all.\u201d Rong Yi immediately took his Storage Ring out but only found that there was not a single spiritual stone in it. He swore sullenly, \u201cDamn it! Although money is not almighty, you really can\u2019t live without money.\u201dAfter he went back, he would make a lot of money, otherwise he couldn\u2019t even afford a little thing.Rong Yi then turned to Bu Qi who was burning rune papers, \u201cBu Qi, did you bring spiritual stones with you? Borrow me some. I will pay you back after we go back.\u201dBu Qi then took out a bag of spiritual stones and gave it to him, \u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cI have to.\u201d Rong Yi opened the bag which was filled with upper grade spiritual stones. He then took one out and handed it to the disciple.While giving him the change, the disciple said, \u201cHang on for a second. I\u2019ll ask them to carry them down.\u201dHe then walked to the stairs and yelled towards upstairs, \u201cSenior Meng, Senior Shao, someone wants the Campsis Stones. Please get them down.\u201dSomeone upstairs replied, \u201cGot it.\u201dBu Qi walked over and asked, \u201cMaster shifu, why would you buy those Campsis Stones?\u201dHe had also learned magic weapon and equipment refining, so he also knew about ingredients. But for his knowledge, Campsis Stones were totally useless.Rong Yi slighted over, \u201cThey are useful of course, whether refining magic weapons or equipment.\u201dThe disciple who said Campsis Stones were worthless grinned, thinking, \u201cIf those things are really so useful, they would be arrears of stock and so cheap!\u201dAt this time, someone put all those Campsis Stones in the Storage Ring and walked downstairs. When he saw Rong Yi who was standing by the counter, his face sank, \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rong Yi quickly put those Campsis Stones into his Storage Ring and didn\u2019t give him a chance to regret at all.He touched his ring overjoyed. Those ingredients in ancient times inexhaustible, so he could collect as many as he wanted.Meng Hua was surprised it was Rong Yi who bought those ingredients. He snorted, \u201cA wasted loser with no spiritual root also wants to buy ingredients? This is a joke!\u201dRong Yi sneered, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t choke to death on the joke!\u201dMeng Hua slightly narrowed his eyes.The disciple who had said those Campsis Stone were worthless asked, \u201cSenior Meng, who is he?\u201dWhen he got enrolled into Nine Voide Sect, Rong Yi had already married into Yin Mansion. So most disciples didn\u2019t even see Rong Yi before. Even his peers seldom had the chance to see him.Meng Hua peered at the two female disciples inside the counter, \u201cUncle Rong that Donghuan and others often gossiped about.\u201dThe two female disciples popped out their eyes. They never thought that one of the male leads they have been talking about was standing right before them. But to be honest, Rong Yi was really pretty, ever prettier than them girls, big and bright eyes, thin and ruddy lips. There is no gainsaying that Rong Yi and Bai Yunchen really matched perfectly. Pity that he had no spiritual root. Even with the best elixir, he still would die of old age and wouldn\u2019t grow old with his senior brother Bai Yunchen.The disciple who said that those Campsis Stones were useless snorted. No spiritual root means no cultivation, and also means that he couldn\u2019t refine magic weapons, but sarcastically he said those Campsis Stones were of great use, pretending to know things others didn\u2019t. What! Is he trying to show off his talent to them? Pity that he got exposed on spot. So embarrassing!Meng Hua turned around and said to the other cultivator who came down with him, \u201cSenior Shao, shouldn\u2019t you go say hello to your uncle?\u201dShao Xingjiang snorted, \u201cSuch an uncle is way out of my league.\u201dMeng Hua smiled and then said, \u201cOh right, senior Shao, I heard the chief plans to get your grandfather promoted as a peak leader and reward Tianxu Peak as your abode.\u201dOn hearing this, Shao Xingjiang was extremely cocky, \u201cExactly. The chief said if the head of Tianxu Peak still won\u2019t come back half a year later, he will let my grandfather take in charge. I heard Tianxu Peak is most sufficient with spiritual qi. If I can cultivate there, I will definitely speed up like riding on an arrow.\u201d\u201cToo much noise!\u201d Rong Yi picked his ear and flipped the earwax, showing he was not interested in their two-man comic show. He then kept checking if there were any especially good ingredients on sale.His indifferent expression made Meng Hua and Shao Xingjiang unable to carry on their conversation, who could only stare at Rong Yi before the counter, face darkened.Bu Qi peered at them and said, \u201cMaster shifu, what about go out to take a walk?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Since Rong Yi didn\u2019t find anything that intrigued his interest, he then followed Bu Qi to a corner, asking, \u201cDo you know\u2026well\u2026where my father has been to?\u201dBu Qi shook his head, \u201cImmortal Yunyi said your father left five years ago, saying that he was going to look for the method of planting spiritual root for you. But during these five years, no one has ever heard any news from him. The last time some disciple saw him was in Beiba Prefecture four and half years ago. That disciple heard that he said he was looking for some place to another cultivator. As for where he was going, he didn\u2019t tell. And then your father asked a disciple to take a message saying that he would never come back if he could not find that place and everything of Tianxu Peak would be left to the chief to deal with.\u201dRong Yi was curious, \u201cWhat place was he looking for? Did he need to leave his son and all the disciples behind?\u201dIf Rong Weiyi had still been in Nine Void Sect that year, he would never have allowed the original owner\u2019s mother to let his own son to give birth to babies for someone else.\u201cThat disciple said when they were talking about that place, they looked very excited and furtive, like they had found a shaken secret.\u201d\u201cDid you ask my mother where my father has been?\u201d\u201cYou know, Nine Void Sect doesn\u2019t get along with your mother\u2019s sect.\u201d\u201cSince they don\u2019t get along, how did they give birth to me?\u201d\u201cThen you should ask your parents.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough Rong Yi was curious about the place Rong Weiyi was looking for, since no one knew, he could only bury it in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them was Immortal Yunyi, next to him was an old man wearing a red-and-white strip robe, and three children who were wearing the same clothes as him, all about four or five years old.Immortal Yunyi yelled at an old man wearing red and white strip robes angrily, \u201cOf course my little disciple is better than yours. He could refine magic weapons at three.\u201dThe old man wearing red and white stripe robes sneered, \u201cMy three disciples also began to refine magic weapon at three. What makes you think your disciple is better than mine? Besides, your disciple has only started learning it not long ago. Do you really think you can beat me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Immortal Yunyi walked into the competition hall, \u201cStop! Stop! Everybody stop!\u201dThose disciples who were refining magic weapon all failed because of his disturbing and stood up sullenly to glare at him.Rong Yi and Bu Qi then moved before the gate of the hall, \u201cWhat is Immortal Yunyi doing?\u201dBu Qi said helplessly, \u201cHe is showing off to Immortal Jixin of Xuanxin Sect that he has taken a talented disciple.\u201dRong Yi pointed at himself, \u201cIs that talented disciple my son?\u201dBu Qi nodded.Rong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was not that he belittled his son. It was that Yin Tao had only started learning to refine magic weapons. He couldn\u2019t even make a good shape, how could Yunyi brag before others?Seeing that those disciples were complaining, Immortal Yunyi waved his hand, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. The competition just now doesn\u2019t count.\u201dThe disciples jumped to their feet and cheered. They had all been too tense just now only fearing that they would fail to refine good magic weapons. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have failed the moment Immortal Yunyi shouted at them. But now since they were given a new chance, of course they well overjoyed.The immortal who was in charge of supervising those disciples quickly walked to Immortal Yunyi, \u201cWhat brings you here, grandmaster shifu?\u201d\u201cI come for my little disciple.\u201d Immortal Yunyi scanned the hall and saw that Yin Tao was sitting in a corner refining magic weapons. He immediately put on a smile, \u201cWhen my little disciple is refining magic weapon, he wouldn\u2019t move even heaven collapses. That\u2019s why I like most.\u201dImmortal Jixin snorted slightly, \u201cMy three disciples are also that good.\u201d\u201cHum!\u201d Immortal Yunyi then turned to Yin Tao, \u201cJust wait a minute. He would succeed soon.\u201dRong Yi looked in through the window. Yin Tao\u2019s little face was quite serious, no usual giggling or what. He was just staring at the furnace attentively, indicating that he was refining the magic weapon seriously.Rong Yi saw it was golden fire in the furnace, \u201cPity that he owns mutant Golden-fire Spiritual Root. He could do better if it is Thunder-fire Spiritual Root.\u201dBu Qi agreed to it.Yin Tao threw the last piece of ingredients into the furnace and let it slowly infuse with other ingredients. After about half an hour, the magic weapon was finally forged. He activated it and flied it out of the furnace, crying happily, \u201cI made it! I made it!\u201dWhen he noticed that everyone in the hall was staring at him, he was a little surprised. Then he saw Immortal Yunyi who was standing headmost, he immediately said excitedly, \u201cOld master shifu, I made it!\u201dThen Yin Tao ran towards him.Immortal Yunyi squatted down, opening his arms smilingly. But when Yin Tao was on halfway, he saw Rong Yi outside the window. Eyes beaming, he then turned around and ran to the window, \u201cDaddy, daddy, I made it.\u201dHe was so happy that his daddy could come to watch him compete. He jumped out of the window and held Rong Yi\u2019s neck, \u201cDaddy, see? I have made a magic weapon successfully.\u201dRong Yi said with a smile, \u201cImpressive.\u201dAnd Yin Tao then kissed on his face happily.Being kissed by such a cute baby, Rong Yi\u2019s heart softened however hard it had ever been. He felt like he didn\u2019t hate kids so much as before.Immortal Jixin then made fun of Immortal Yunyi who was still squatting there, \u201cSee? Your disciple doesn\u2019t put you in his eyes at all.\u201dImmortal Yunyi didn\u2019t care at all. He hummed slightly and then moved to Rong Yi\u2019s side with a smile, \u201cLittle Cherry\u2019s daddy, what are you doing here?\u201dRong Yi gave Bu Qi a look and said, \u201cWe came here by accident.\u201dImmortal Yunyi then said to Yin Tao, \u201cLittle Cherry, show me your magic weapon.\u201dYin Tao then handed his level one magic weapon to Immortal Yunyi.Immortal Yunyi turned around and showed it to Immortal Jixin, saying happily, \u201cSee? It\u2019s not bad, right?\u201dElder Jixin then looked at the magic weapon. Forget about the shape, it was really a rare thing that a three-year-old child could have refined a level one magic weapon. He nodded. Before he opened his mouth, an older kid of the three who was standing next to him said with disdain, \u201cSo ugly!\u201dOther two kids also echoed, \u201cYeah, really ugly!\u201dImmortal Yunyi said angrily, \u201cWhen you just started learning, your magic weapon were no better this.\u201dElder Jixin then stroke his big disciple\u2019s head, \u201cThis kid is a perfectionist. The magic weapon he has refined at the age of three could be as good as those refined by a ten-year-old kid. Though the shape is not so delicate, it\u2019s much better that a lot of young magic weapon refiners.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201dElder Jixin then took out a delicate magic weapon and handed it to Immortal Yunyi to appreciate, \u201cThis is a level one pure magic weapon he has refined a few days ago.\u201dImmortal Yunyi took a glance. It was undeniable that it was indeed not bad.Rong Yi suddenly felt uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t mean to compete that old man\u2019s disciple with his son. He just felt uneasy when he heard someone said his son was no better that other kids.No wonder his mother would have turned from a graceful woman into a shrew every time she someone was denouncing his second elder brother, saying his cultivation was no better than others. She couldn\u2019t bear a single bad word of her kids.Rong Yi now felt the same way as his mother.Immortal Jixin smiled, \u201cImmortal Yunyi, do you still think it\u2019s necessary to compete?\u201dImmortal Yunyi immediately said, \u201cSure. Why not? We are competing whose magic weapon is more powerful, but not competing its shape. When my Tao\u2019er grows up, he will definitely make better-looking ones. But it\u2019s only fair to let your youngest disciple to compete.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Immortal Jixin patted the shoulder of his youngest disciple and said, \u201cYi\u2019er, do you have the confidence?\u201dHe Shuiyi nodded and said while looking at Yin Tao, \u201cShifu, I will kick his ass.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayImmortal Yun Yi said to Yin Tao, \u201cLittle Cherry, would you like to compete with him?\u201dYin Tao was clinging on Rong Yi. On hearing Yunyi, he rubbed on Rong Yi\u2019s face with his, \u201cI wanna go home with daddy.\u201dImmortal Yunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThose female disciples around all thought Yin Tao was so cute, especially father and son were wearing the same robes, making them also want such an adorable kid, and they could also wear the same clothes and the same accessories, from which people could tell they were family.Immortal Jixin laughed, \u201cSo this is still a baby that still drinks milk.\u201dRong Yi smiled slightly. Yin Tao was a total innocent and pure kid. That kid called Yi\u2019er was too competitive at such a young age who might go to the dogs after encountering setbacks in his life. That was bad for cultivation.He Shuiyi snorted, \u201cCoward!\u201dYin Tao pouted, \u201cI am no coward!\u201dImmortal Yunyi came to coax him, \u201cLittle Cherry, what about you go home after the competition?\u201dOther disciples were all jealous of Yin Tao since even Immortal Yunyi would bow down to coax such a little kid like him.Yin Tao looked up to Rong Yi, \u201cDaddy, will you wait for me?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Immortal Yunyi cut in and answered him on\u00a0 Rong Yi\u2019s behalf quickly.Rong Yi gave Immortal Yunyi a hard look! This old man really likes making decisions for others.Yin Tao nodded, \u201cThen I\u2019ll compete with him first.\u201dImmortal Yunyi said excitedly, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, Rong Yi said, \u201cI want to have some words with little Cherry alone.\u201dImmortal Yunyi promptly nodded, \u201cOK. Be quick!\u201dRong Yi then carried the boy beside the parterre in the yard. He squatted down and pointed at a blooming yellow chrysanthemum and asked Yin Tao, \u201cIs it pretty?\u201dImmortal Yunyi hurriedly released his spiritual sense to overhear their conversation.\u201cYes.\u201d Yin Tao nodded at the chrysanthemum.Rongyi asked him to move closer, and then he turned the chrysanthemum in his hand to let him see the overall appearance of it, \u201cyou can see that there are not many petals in the chrysanthemum. Each petal is thin and pointed, and very thin. In the middle, there is a flower core ball formed by overlapping petals\u2026\u201dOn hearing that, Immortal Yunyi frowned. He thought Rong Yi would teach Yin Tao how to refine magic weapons but it turned to be some useless conversation, so he withdrew his spiritual sense.\u201cI like chrysanthemums most. Do you like them?\u201d\u201cIf daddy likes them, I do too.\u201dRong Yi stroked Yin Tao\u2019s little head. After talking for about half an hour while appreciating those chrysanthemums, Rong Yi took out a Campsis Stone he had bought not long ago and gave it to Yin Tao, \u201cAfter you have refined the magic weapon, you smelt it till it becomes transparent and then engrave it onto the magic weapon. You remember?\u201dYin Tao nodded.Rong Yi then stood up and walked in front of Immortal Yunyi with Yin Tao.Immortal Yunyi patted on Yin Tao\u2019s shoulder softly and said, \u201cI have selected the ingredients for you. You can start later.\u201dKids were still young and didn\u2019t know how to select ingredients, so their masters would prepare the needed ingredients for them before they refined magic weapons.Yin Tao then came before the assigned furnace and sat down, then ignited the furnace with his golden fire.He Shuiyi owned mutant Fire Spiritual Root, so the temperature of the fire he generated was much higher than those who owned ordinary fire spiritual root. But even so, those disciples aside were all looking at him with jealousy. Though they also owned Fire Spiritual Root, they also owned other spirituals roots at the same time. Naturally their cultivation speed was slower that those who owned single spiritual root, thus the magic weapons they refined were less powerful.He Shuiyi was a little faster. After he smelted those ingredients, he immediately put the rest ingredients in. After all those ingredients were fused together, he generated his spiritual power to slowly make it into the shape in his head.Every move of him let those disciples think he was pretty confident of what he was doing. On the other hand, Yin Tao was comparatively slow, but he didn\u2019t look anxious at all, like he was refining magic weapons as usual, no others watching and no so-called competition.After the shape of the magic weapon is formed, He Shuiyi ceased the fire. He then took it before Immortal Jixin happily, \u201cMaster shifu, I\u2019m done.\u201dThe magic weapon he had refined was a golden cyan hammer, level one. The appearance was a bit rough, but much better that the one Yin Tao had refined last time. At least everyone could tell it was a hammer. But the one Yin Tao had refined last time was\u2026what to say\u2026like a lump if you might call that, like he directly took it out after smelting all the ingredients together, no shaping process at all.From the appearances, all disciples thought Yin Tao would lose for sure.Immortal Yunyi looked at Yin Tao anxiously. When he saw Yin Tao threw the last ingredient into the furnace, he felt a bit relieved. But, after Yin Tao had smelted all these ingredients, he took out a black stone giving off faint light out of his Storage Bracelet.\u201cHmm? What kind of ingredients is the stone he used? Why have I never seen it before?\u201dSome new disciples asked other senior brothers out of curiosity.They looked at each other, confused. No one knew what it was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt\u2019s Campsis Stone!\u201d someone suddenly said.Then everyone turned to the one who was speaking. It was Xu Yi who said those Campsis Stones were worthless in that shop. He also came on hearing the noise.Meng Hua and Shao Xingjiang also came. When they say that Rong Yi\u2019s son put the Campsis Stone into the furnace, they both sneered. Rong Yi could not refine magic weapons with those stones, so he used them on his son. What he didn\u2019t know was by doing this his son would be humiliated.Some disciple asked, \u201cCampsis Stones? Why have we never received those stones? We even have never heard of it.\u201dXu Yi sneered, \u201cCampsis Stone is level one upper ingredients, originated from the desert of Xijing Prefecture, with dense spiritual qi and some certain defensive power. At first most cultivators used them to refine magic weapon, but the surface of those magic weapons was pretty rough, some even had kind of rugged and sharp gravels, which would often cut the hands of the cultivators who used them. Over time, few people used them. Only those rune makers would grind them into powder and engraved onto their runes, on one hand, for some defensive use, on the other hand, for decoration, because after it was grinded into powder, it was glittering. Most female disciples liked beautiful runes, so to cater their preference, the rune makers would use some.\u201dThose disciples were confused, \u201cSince they are useless, why would Immortal Yunyi\u2019s little disciple add it into his magic weapon?\u201dImmortal Yunyi was also confused. There were no Campsis Stones among the ingredients he had prepared. Why would Yin Tao add them in without even telling him?He then subconsciously turned to Rong Yi. His intuition told him it was Rong Yi. He wonder what Yin Tao was trying to do.Rong Yi curled up his lips, quite satisfied with his son being so obedient.The Campsis Stones had high stiffiness, hard to refine, besides, Yin Tao was only at the qi practicing stage, with not enough spiritual power. Half an hour had passed, but he still couldn\u2019t smelt the Campsis Stone. Those onlookers gradually lost patience and most of them went out of the yard for some chitchat.He Shuiyi and his people also became impatient. He looked up to Immortal Jixin, \u201cMaster shifu, can he do it or not?\u201dRong Yi have him a glance, didn\u2019t say a word.Immortal Yunyi was also a little impatient and moved to Rong Yi\u2019s side, asking, \u201cWhat did you ask him to do?\u201dRong Yi smiled, \u201cRefining magic weapon, of course.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBu Qi patted on Immortal Yunyi\u2019s shoulder and comforted him, \u201cTake it easy.\u201dImmortal Yunyi looked at the while paper in his hand and then the ashes on the ground, \u201cWhat were you doing? Just now you kept burning papers. Who were you burning them for?\u201d\u201cFor you.\u201d Bu Qi then kept burning papers to practice.Immortal Yunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi then laughed in spite of himself, \u201cIt should be done soon.\u201dAbout another half an hour, Yin Tao finally was done.Those disciples who were yawning immediately yelled at the disciples in the yard, \u201cIt\u2019s done! It\u2019s done!\u201dThen all disciples instantly ran into the hall.Yin Tao used his spiritual to fly the magic weapon out of the furnace and a blooming golden chrysanthemum appeared before everyone. Under the light, it was like a divine magic weapon, glittering.At first no one expected he would make a good shape, but when they saw that beautiful golden chrysanthemum, they got all amazed, jaws dropped. The one the former little disciple had refined couldn\u2019t compare with it at all.Yin Tao then ran to Rong Yi excitedly, \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m done. It\u2019s daddy\u2019s favorite flower. Here.\u201dRong Yi couldn\u2019t help kissing on his little face. The little thing still remembered that he said he liked chrysanthemums. So heartwarming!\u201cLittle Cherry, you should send it to your daddy later. Be good.\u201d Immortal Yunyi quickly strode forward to check it, \u201cIts shape is like a chrysanthemum\u2026\u201dHe recalled that Rong Yi had taken Yin Tao to appreciate those chrysanthemums, so he raised his head and asked Rong Yi, \u201cYou brought him to appreciate the chrysanthemums only wanting him to smelt his magic weapon into a good shape?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d Rong Yi kissed on Yin Tao\u2019s little cheek, \u201cThe kid is too young. It is impossible to let him create a good shape, so before he smelt the magic weapon, I let him keep some shape of other things in his head. So when he was refining, he could smelt it according to the thing he has kept in mind.\u201d\u201cGood! Good! That\u2019s brilliant.\u201d praised Immortal Yunyi.He took the magic weapon Yin Tao had refined before Immortal Jixin, \u201cSee? This time the magic weapon my little disciple has refined looks even better than your disciple\u2019s!?\u201dImmortal Jixin laughed, \u201cYeah, kind of. But my disciple\u2019s is level one magical one, while yours is only level one refined kind.Immortal Yunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe could clearly feel his little disciple\u2019s magic weapon had higher spiritual power, how could it have lower level???He Shuiyi pulled Immortal Jixin\u2019s sleeve and asked excitedly, \u201cShifu, do I win?\u201dImmortal Jixin cast a glance at Immortal Yunyi who was wearing a long face, curling up his lips, \u201cOf cour\u2026\u201dRong Yi then cut in, \u201cYour magic weapon has higher level, so what? Yours still could not beat my son\u2019s.\u201dImmortal Yunyi immediately said, \u201cRight. We\u2019ll only know after the competition. Since the magic weapons are done, why not have a competition?\u201dImmortal Jixin snorted, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till the fat lady sing (an idiom from Harry Porter series)! All right. I\u2019ll let you be sincerely convinced! The two kids just finished refining and a bit exhausted. So I\u2019m gonna be on his behalf.\u201dHe activated the magic weapon and then rushed toward Immortal Yunyi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayImmortal Yunyi hurriedly drove his magic weapon. Then one petal of the chrysanthemum magic weapon turned into a shield and warded off Immortal Jixin\u2019s attack.Bang! Two magic weapons clashed!Generally speaking, when a higher level magic weapon hit a lower level one, the lower level one would not resist its fierce attack and explode. But, the magic weapon in Immortal Yunyi\u2019s hand was in perfect condition.Everybody was surprised. Even Bu Qi stopped burning rune papers and watched them fight.Immortal Yunyi smiled, and his confidence had greatly increased on seeing that. The petals of his magic weapon then turned into sharp daggers and shot at Immortal Jixin like an arrow rain.Immortal Jixin quickly activated the shield inside the magic weapon to resist the shooting of those petals.After those petals hit the shield, they started spinning crazily like tops, like they would never stop before they drilled through the shield.Boom!The petals drilled through the shield and shot at Immortal Jixin.He quickly picked up the hammer and swept away those petals, which hit the hammer with a clanging sound.When the elder heard the voice, he looked at the magic weapon in his hand. The hammer, which was as thick as his fist, cracked. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201dImmortal Yunyi then smiled, also a bit surprised, \u201cShall we still go on?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Immortal Jixin touched his magic weapon slightly and it immediately fell apart onto the ground.It seemed He Shuiyi got a heavy blow, standing there and watching the handle left in Immortal Jixin\u2019s hand.Those disciples were all amazed. Level one refined magic weapon cracked level one magical one? That was unbelievable!Immortal Yunyi then said with a smile, \u201cImmortal Jixin, are you convinced this times?\u201dImmortal Jixin then grabbed the magic weapon from his hand, noticing that the spiritual qi of it was even denser. And after taking a closer look, he found there was a thin transparent layer on it. He then asked Yin Tao, \u201cWhat is that transparent thing on it?\u201dYin Tao then said, \u201cCampsis Stones.\u201d\u201cCampsis stones?\u201d Immortal Jixin touched the smooth surface and frowned, \u201cHow are Campsis Stones transparent? Besides, if you smelt the Campsis Stones into the magic weapon, it\u2019d make the surface unsmooth and also would hurt the user\u2019s hands. But yours is quite smooth.\u201dRong Yi explained, \u201cSmelting the Campsis Stones into transparent liquid, and the apply it onto the surface of the magic weapon. It wouldn\u2019t diminish the power of it, meanwhile it could protect it from getting destroyed easily by those three levels higher, and could improve its attacking. If it is applied onto master grade magic weapon, it could great reduce its repair frequency, and doesn\u2019t need expensive ingredients to fix, which could save a large amount of spiritual stones. But the higher the magic weapon is, the more time it needs to refine those Campsis Stones, besides, the cultivator has to input spiritual power to intensify it, after all it just belongs to level one top grade ingredients. It\u2019s kind of difficult for it to protect high level magic weapons.\u201dIn modern times, materialist lacked of ingredients. It was already not an easy thing to own a high level magic weapon. If it got broken, the cultivator might not even be able to find the original ingredients to fix it, so one would usually apply a lay of Campsis Stone on the magic weapon.Having been in the hall for so long, this was the first time Immortal Jixin looked at Rong Yi, \u201cIf it is true as you said. Campsis Stones are really super ingredients. I\u2019m gonna have a try after I go back.\u201dOn hearing that, those disciples all turned to ask Xu Yi from the magic weapon store, \u201cSenior Xu, do you still have Campsis Stones in your shop? I want some\u2026Me too\u2026I also want some\u2026\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d Then everyone strived to buy the stones.Both Meng Hua and Shao Xingjiang\u2019s face both turned dark and gloomy. They never expected that Campsis Stones were this useful. They only sold their 26 whole boxes for only 260 lower grade spiritual stones! What a bargain!Xu Yi\u2019s face turned ghastly pale, \u201cNo!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? No one has ever bought them before? You should have some inventories.\u201dXu Yi cast a glance at Rong Yi who was playing with the kid, \u201cUncle Rong has bought them all.\u201d\u201cWho is uncle Rong?\u201d\u201cDaddy of that little disciple of Immortal Yunyi.\u201dEverybody looked over to Rong Yi and then back at Xu Yi, \u201cWhen will you replenish the stock?\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be any in one or two years. It\u2019s originated from the desert of Xijing Prefecture. It\u2019s hot and dangerous there. If without any mission, no one would go there.\u201dEverybody felt disappointed.\u201cI wonder if other stores have them.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d some disciple said affirmatively, \u201cThose were brought back by disciples who have gone through experience and toughening there. No shop would sell things they can\u2019t make money.Someone then asked Rong Yi, \u201cUncle Rong, can you sell us some?\u201dRong Yi said decently, \u201cSure. Ten upper grade spiritual stones for one.\u201dOn hearing that, Xu Yi, Meng Hua and Shao Xingjiang nearly spitted out blood. They sold those Campsis stones at the price of over 100 low grade spiritual stones each box. If selling at the price Rong Yi named, they were worthy at least 26 thousand upper grade spiritual stones! Rong Yi was rich this time!Some disciples who were super rich immediately shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll buy!\u201dRong Yi sold one hundred and thirty-four pieces in succession and made a great fortune. In fact, he did not mean to use it on Yin Tao. But thinking that in this world it had abundant resources, he could still buy more or find more. So he changed his mind and used the magic weapon little Yin Tao had refined to improve the price and made a great fortune.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I think they look pretty good. So I also want to make a few suits.\u201d One female disciple asked. Although they were required to wear the robe of the sect, they would often go down the mountain or go out for training, so that they could wear other robes.Rong Yi answered, \u201cThere was a clothing shop in Eastwood Street. It\u2019d open after the competition is over. Things are rather cheap. You can go there and take a look then.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d That female disciple immediately said to her peers, \u201cAfter the competition, let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dThe immortal who was supervising the competition then shouted, \u201cGo back to your own seats. The competition starts in an hour!\u201dOn hearing him, everybody went back to their own seats.Immortal Yunyi then said to the immortal, \u201cMy little disciple would quit. Ranking means nothing to him.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, sure.\u201dRong Yi then walked out of the hall with Immortal Yunyi and others, holding Yin Tao\u2019s hand.Immortal Yunyi said cockily, \u201cJixin, are you convinced this time?\u201dImmortal Jixin snorted, \u201cThis time it\u2019s not about whose is more powerful, but about the ingredients.\u201dImmortal Yunyi did not argue with him since he won, and what Immortal Jixin said made sense. Without the Campsis Stone, Yin Tao could not win He Shuiyi. After all, He Shuiyi was a year ahead of Yin Tao.He caught a glimpse of He Shuiyi who looked a bit frustrated, \u201cHmm, your disciple is indeed impressive. Some day he will definitely become a superb magic weapon refiner.\u201dImmortal Yunyi then rubbed He Shuiyi\u2019s little head and said, \u201cAfter you go back, keep up your good work. Next year I\u2019ll let little Cherry compete with you again. And at that time he won\u2019t lose again.\u201dHe Shuiyi raised his head, \u201cAre you trying to say I won this time?\u201dImmortal Yunyi smiled, \u201cYours is level one magical one, my disciple\u2019s is level one refining one. Of course you won.\u201d\u201cYay!\u201d He Shuiyi immediately jumped and cheered holding his seniors\u2019 hands.Immortal Yunyi then took them to his abode.Rong Yi took out a bag of spiritual stones and give it to Bu Qi, \u201cHere.\u201dBu Qi didn\u2019t refuse.Rong Yi sized up Immortal Yunyi\u2019s abode while holding Yin Tao\u2019s hand.Then everybody sat in the hall, and one disciple here served them some spiritual tea.Rong Yi and Yin Tao looked at the spiritual tea and then the disciple standing aside who served it, and then Immortal Yunyi. Rong Yi felt a little depressed. Only tea?!Immortal Yuiyi noticed it and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d The father and son said simultaneously.\u201c\u2026\u201d Immortal Yunyi then asked the disciple to serve a few plates of spiritual fruit.But spiritual fruit could only supplement one\u2019s spiritual qi, but could not stuff the father and son\u2019s belly.Bu Qi was a bit confused, \u201cMaster shifu, haven\u2019t you been eating all the way here? How come you are still hungry?\u201dRong Yi also had no idea.Immortal Yunyi asked, \u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable? Or getting possessed?\u201dIf he got possessed, it was no way they couldn\u2019t see it through.Rong Yi shook his head, \u201cI feel good. I mean, I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable or what. But I always feel I am hungry, like the food I ate would be digested soon.\u201dEven the food in his Storage Ring was eaten up.Immortal Jixin said, \u201cI know a little leechcraft. What about I feel the pulse for you?\u201dRong Yi hesitated a bit and nodded, \u201cThank you then.\u201dImmortal Jixin then switched his seat with Bu Qi and felt Rong Yi\u2019s pulse and then frowned.On seeing this, Immortal Yunyi became anxious, \u201cDoes he get some serious disease?\u201dImmortal Jixin didn\u2019t make a sound. After feeling the pulse of the other hand, he frowned even tighter.Immortal Yunyi then urged, \u201cCome on! Say something!\u201dNoticing Immortal Jixin\u2019s face, Rong Yi also became very tense, \u201cAm I having some terrible illness? Immortal Jixin, I can take it. Just tell me what I have got.\u201dBu Qi\u2019s face sank, \u201cWhatever illness it is, I will find the best herbs to cure you.\u201dImmortal Jixin exhaled a breath, rubbed his temple and said, \u201cI think Imust have been too exhausted today, so I would have illusions.\u201dImmortal Yun Yi glared at him, \u201cI served you superior spiritual tea and you still feel exhausted?\u201d\u201cLet me try again.\u201d Immortal Jixin then felt Rong Yi\u2019s pulse again, it was still the same type of pulse. He frowned, \u201cIs it possible my leechcraft is not qualified?\u201d\u201cWhat type of pulse is it?\u201d Immortal Yunyi was very nervous, \u201cIf you can\u2019t cure him, I\u2019ll send them to get the physician.\u201dImmortal Jixin looked at Immortal Yunyi, saying reluctantly, \u201cI felt the pregnancy pulse! Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m having illusion?\u201dBoth Immortal Yunyi and Rong Yi looked at him, with a full face of question marks, \u201cPregnancy pulse?\u201dImmortal Jixin said to Rong Yi, \u201cYeah, I felt your pulse and found you are pregnant.\u201dImmortal Yunyi, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dBu Qi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen the three of them heaved a sigh of relief.Immortal Yunyi said grumpily, \u201cYou old thing! You nearly scared the shit out of me.\u201dThis time it was Immortal Jixin who got confused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Immortal Yunyi told Immortal Jixin about Rong Yi, Immortal Jixin knew that Rong Yi was really pregnant, \u201cWhen I saw his big belly, I thought it\u2019s kind of mid-age spread. How would I know even a man would be willing to give birth to babies.\u201dHe then looked at Yin Tao, \u201cIs it possible your little disciple his son?\u201dImmortal Yunyi nodded, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s his son.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Having been living for over a thousand years, it was the very first time that Immortal Jixin saw a man giving birth!Immortal Yunyi pointed at Rong Yi\u2019s belly and said, \u201cThis one inside is my another little disciple. Come on! Check how he is doing in there.\u201dRong Yi hummed, \u201cAre you so sure the baby in my belly could also be a magic weapon talent?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes and ignored him.Immortal Jixin felt Rong Yi\u2019s pulse again and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. The baby is in great condition. He is absorbing his daddy\u2019s spiritual qi without a break, which might be the reason why Rong Yi is so easy to feel hungry.\u201dImmortal Yunyi felt thrilled, \u201cCan you tell when he is gonna deliver the baby?\u201dRong Yi was both pissed off and speechless, \u201cWhy are you even more anxious than its father me?\u201dImmortal Yunyi didn\u2019t say a word.Rong Yi then continued, \u201cThe physician in the mansion said it needs another two years at least.\u201dImmortal Jixin said, \u201cNo, maybe one year later, maybe ever earlier. The more spiritual power he absorbs, the earlier. If you want him to come out ASAP, then transmit more spiritual power for him.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dOne year or even earlier\u2026What to do? He was not ready to give birth to a baby!Immortal Yunyi then slipped some spiritual fruit into his hand, \u201cEat some more.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him.At this time, the disciple who was guarding outside came to report, \u201cGrandmaster shifu, a disciple from Taixu Peak comes to invite uncle Rong and the little master to have dinner at their place.\u201dImmortal Yunyi raised his eyebrows, \u201cNews has legs. They knew Rong Yi is here already.\u201dRong Yi was confused. Who would invite him to Taixu Peak as the honored guest?Immortal Yunyi then said to Rong Yi, \u201cSince your grandfather invites you, you should not turn him down. Take little Cherry to visit him. He knows that little Cherry is my disciple, so I guess he would not get your goat.\u201dRong Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dTo be honest, he really didn\u2019t want to meet any relative of the original owner. He didn\u2019t know them at all. He didn\u2019t know what to talk. But that was the original owner\u2019s grandfather, it was inappropriate to say no.Immortal Yunyi said to Bu Qi, \u201cBu Qi, you go with them.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Bu Qi held up Yin Tao, led Rong Yu out of the mansion, and then flew the sword with the disciple of Taixu Peak.On the way to Taixu Peak, someone called them suddenly.\u201cRong Yi!\u201dRong Yi turned around and saw a beautiful woman flying fast toward them.\u201cRong Yi, finally I found you!\u201d The beautiful woman flew to Rong Yi\u2019s side, saying while holding his hand, \u201cMy aunt told me you are here for the test, so she has specially prepared a whole table of dishes to entertain you. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe disciple from Taixu Peak immediately said, \u201cGuard Rong, our lord has already invited Uncle Rong and them to have dinner there.\u201dRong Yuanqin cast a bland look at that disciple, \u201cGo tell my dad that Rong Yi is going to our abode to have lunch and then go to visit him later.\u201dThe disciple of Taixu Peak showed a slice of awkwardness, \u201cGuard Rong, we invited him first and now you cut in. It\u2019s a little inappropriate, isn\u2019t it? And I don\u2019t know how to explain to the lord.\u201dRong Yuanqin ignored him, held Rong Yi\u2019s hand and jumped onto her flying sword.\u201cSecond sister, wait a sec.\u201d A gentle voice came from afar at this time. Then a graceful lady flew before them on a sword.After Rong Yuanqin saw it was her third sister-in-law Liu Yuyi, her face sank.Liu Yuyi gave her a gentle smile and said, \u201cYuanqin, it\u2019s dad who invited Rong Yi first. It\u2019s really not appropriate to cut in. Dad would not be happy.\u201dShe had anticipated that someone would hold Rong Yi up, so she came in person.Rong Yuanqin snorted, \u201cExcept my third brother, has our father been happy for anything we do? Since he would not be happy whatever I do, why would I give him face?\u201d\u201cSecond sister, he is still your father. Whether he is happy or not, he is our father and our elder. You shouldn\u2019t say anything bad about him.\u201d Liu Yu Yi waved to the Rong Yi ad said with a gentle smile, \u201cLittle Yi, come here, I will take you to see your grandfather. He has been nagging about you every day and worried about you living outside alone. Since today he knows that you will come to school today for the test, he specially ordered them to prepare a full table of dishes, and a lot of toys for your son.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He took back the hurt hand and rubbed it. Just as he opened his mouth to refuse their invitation, Rong Yuanqin sneered, \u201cFather talks about Rong Yi every day? Hehe, are you kidding? I see that he is curing Rong Yi and wishing he would die sooner, then he wouldn\u2019t bring disgrace to the family. Hum! I don\u2019t know why was so angry after knowing Rong Yi was pregnant and even claimed to kill Rong Yi at once.\u201dLiu Yuyi was still wearing a calm smile, \u201cNo matter who heard his grandson is pregnant he would be angry, say some angry words, but after the anger, dad also slowly accept the thing? You see Yi and his sin are pretty well, that means father is just saying some angry words, Yi, let\u2019s go. You can\u2019t keep your grandfather waiting.\u201d\u201cHum! Hypocrite!\u201d Rong Yuanqin then turned to Rong Yi, \u201cRong Yi, don\u2019t listen to her. Your grandfather invites you only wanting to ask you about where your father has hidden the ingredients.\u201dIf Rong Yi would go with her, she would never let his father succeed.Liu Yu smiled, frowning, \u201cYuanqin, how can you say that about our father? How would he covet the ingredients our big brother has left to his kid?\u201dRong Yuanqin said sarcastically, \u201cEven if not, that\u2019s because Rong Yi\u2019s son is Immortal Yunyi\u2019s most favored disciple, so dad wants to suck up to Immortal Yunyi, wanting Immortal Yunyi to smelt magic weapons for him.\u201dNow Rong Yi have probably understood both of their purposes, for original owner having such a family, he would feel sad for him. If he could, he wished he would never see those people ever again. \u201cYou two stop quarreling for me. I can tell you now. I would go neither of your abode, not now, and never. And you don\u2019t have to cook something on me, because I don\u2019t know where my dad has hiddem those ingredients, and even if I know, I will not tell you. Beside, don\u2019t expect to use my son to let Immortal Yun smelt magic weapons for you. If you really want him to do it for you, you go beg him yourself. Bu Qi, let\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Bu Qi then switched the direction of the sword.Liu Yuyi hurriedly said, \u201cLittle Yi, don\u2019t listen to your aunt\u2019s bullshit. Your grandfather is not that kind of person.\u201dRong Yi ignored her and said to Yin Tao, \u201cSon, don\u2019t you talk to them if you see them again, or even go with them, you know?\u201dYin Tao nodded, \u201cI got it.\u201d\u201cHum! Kid, you are really overweening!\u201d Someone snorted from far away. And then next moment, five men wearing robes of Nine Void Sect flew over on the swords and stopped before Rong Yi. They even deliberately stopped 1 meter higher in the air, showing kind of commanding position. \u201cHubby!\u201d Liu Yuyi then flew to the man in the headmost.Rong Werchen sneered at Rong Yi, \u201cRong Yi, do you have any idea those words you just said are like saying you\u2019ll cut loose to our whole Rong Family? Hum! Without the protection of Rong Family, you will have no place in Nine Void Sect\u2026\u201dBu Qi then interrupted him, \u201cImmortal Yunyi will protect them well.\u201dHis words were like telling Rong Weichen and others that without Rong Family, Rong Yi could still stay in Nine Void Sect, so they should not be so arrogant.Rong Weichen narrowed his eyes, \u201cOK, fine. You better mark your words today. Don\u2019t you ever come to us if anything happens to you\u2026\u201dRong Yi nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I will never go to look for you. But if you have anything, don\u2019t you ever come to me either. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t entertain you.\u201dFor relatives like them, the more you gave them, the greedier they became, wishing that they could suck out every bit of you. So the best way was to cut loose from them.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Rong Weichen tossed his sleeves and left flying his sword.\u201cHubby, hubby\u2026\u201d Liu Yuyi quickly chased after him. Until Rong Yi could not see them, she immediately lowered her voice and said, \u201cYou were too impulsive just now. Let\u2019s put aside the ingredients your big brother has left. How are you gonna explain to father? And Shao Family! Once Shao Family takes over Tianxu Peak, he has plenty of time to look for the ingredients you big brother has concealed. Having wandered around the world for a few hundred years, your big brother must have gathered numerous precious stuff. Do you want to offer them to Shao Family?\u201dRong Weichen said angrily, \u201cBut look at what that kid said! What did you expect me to do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all your second sister\u2019s fault. She put everything above the table, apparently trying to tell us if she could not get him, neither could us. We can push everything to your big sister and let father figure it out.\u201dRong Weichen nodded, \u201cHmm.\u201dAfter they left, Rong Yuanqin still wanted to exploit something from Rong Yi. Pity that Rong Yi and others directly flew away on the swords.After they flew far away, Bu Qi said, \u201cMaster shifu, don\u2019t worry. Without Rong Family, you still have me and Immortal Yunyi to protect you.\u201dYin Tao immediately shouted, \u201cAnd me! Daddy, you still have me!\u201dRong Yi then pinched his little face softly, \u201cYou little thing! I can carry you with one bare hand. How are you gonna protect me?\u201dYin Tao pouted, \u201cFather is powerful. I can let father protect you.\u201dBu Qi nodded, \u201cMaster Yin is really someone few people have the guts to trifle with.\u201dSpeaking of Yin Jinye, Rong Yi immediately thought of the morning kiss. He couldn\u2019t help touching his lips. After they kissed, he neither felt disgusted nor had the feeling of vomiting, but instead, he kind of missed that kiss now.Rong Yi covered his face with a hand, groaning sullenly. Hadn\u2019t he hated gays and could not bear to see two men kissing and holding each other? Why was he missing a man\u2019s kiss now?\u201dAt this time, over a dozen disciples wearing robes of other sects flew from down the peak and rushed to them and someone yelled at Rong Yi, \u201cRong Yi, you are finally here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Among them, there was the man who he injured with the invitation card the day he had transmigrated here. It seemed Rong Su called him\u2026Quan..Quan Feng! Right, Quan Feng!Bu Qi tilted his head slightly and said to Rong Yi, \u201cMaster Shifu, they are from Taiyuan Sect.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dQuan Feng said to disciples of Taiyuan Sect while pointing at Rong Yi, \u201cThis pregnant sissy is the one who got our senior sister get dumped, making her and out whole Taiyuan Sect humiliated! What the fuck! I have been waiting for you in Jinlin Academy for a few hours and finally you are here. Only killing you could pacify our hearts!\u201dRong Yi was speechless. To wait for him, they even came to Jinlin Academy!Bu Qi held the kid in one hand, and his sword in the other, \u201cMaster Shifu, grab me tightly. Don\u2019t fall down.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Rong Yi then put his hands on his shoulders.Quan Feng stared at Rong Yi fiercely, \u201cLet\u2019s kill him!\u201dThen the whole sixteen disciples from Taiyuan Sect bore down on them.Bu Qi swayed his sword at all of them, and the slashing sword wind immediately threw those sixteen disciples into the air.But since this was the terrain of Nine Void Sect, plus the other side was from Taiyuan Sect, it was not appropriate to hurt them too hard, which might put the chief of Nine Void Sect in between. So after slashing those disciples away, Bu Qi and others left flying the sword.Those sixteen disciples of Taiyuan Sect hurriedly flew their swords to catch themselves and then chased after them. But given their power, it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to catch up with Bu Qi.Bu Qi got rid of them easily.\u201cIt\u2019s really not my day today. I\u2019m just out for a test and could meet so many bad things!\u201d While Rong Yi was complaining, he heard a cheerful sound from not far away, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening out there? Why is there so much noise?\u201dBu Qi said, \u201cI guess we finally arrived at the competition field.\u201dRong Yi was speechless, \u201cWhen we were crazily looking for it, we just couldn\u2019t.

I want to see it.\u201dRong Yi said, \u201cThen let\u2019s go down and have a look.\u201dJufeng Mountain was a huge peak whose mountain top got flattened. It was very broad and could accommodate over hundreds of thousands of people.When Rong Yi and others came to the peak, they saw more than 100,000 disciples were surrounding in several circles, each circle was holding the competition of disciples from different levels, while at the edge of the peak, a row of big stones was used to make the seats from where one could see the whole place specially for the chief and those elders.\u201cMom, look, it\u2019s Rong Yi.\u201d Wei Wenxiao said to her mother while pointing at Rong Yi who was flying down.Rong Yuanyin pulled a long face, \u201cSo he didn\u2019t come here when we were looking for him. He really kept us busy.\u201d\u201cMom, he got helping hands around. We can\u2019t take any rash actions. What should we do?\u201dRong Yuanyin narrowed her eyes. With a glance at the competition field, she had cooked a plan, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got a plan.\u201dShe then got up and went to the deacon who was in charge of the Qi Practicing competition and whispered by his ear.This deacon owed her one. So after hearing her, he immediately nodded approvingly and added Rong Yi\u2019s name on the list.After getting back to her seat, Rong Yuanyin said to his son, \u201cProblem settled.\u201dWei Wenxiao was confused, \u201cHow did you settle it?\u201dRong Yuan sneered, \u201cJust wait for a good show.\u201dRong Yi who was staying with his son completely had no idea that someone was plotting against him. While watching the competition, Rong Yi teased his son, \u201cHow about I throw you onto it?\u201dYin Tao said excitedly, \u201cOK.\u201dRong Yi was embarrassed, \u201cDo you think they are playing?\u2019At this time, the competition of the Qi Practicing disciples was over.Then the deacon went up onto the platform and shouted, \u201cMa Jing from Daoxu Peak, Peng Yifei from Anxu Peak, Wei Shiqiu from Kongxu Peak, Tian Miao from Jixu Peak, Chang Fuming from Jingxu Peak, and Rong Yi from Tianxu Peak, line up!\u201dOn hearing his own name, Rong Yi was struck numb!Bu Qi who was standing behind frowned. Rong Yi from Tianxu Peak? Someone with the same name?It should be someone sharing the same name. After all Rong Yi had just passed the test and could only be qualified to compete two years later.On hearing the deacon was calling Rong Yi\u2019s name, Wei Wenxiao immediately gave Rong Yuanyin a smile, \u201cDestroy him without making our hands dirty. Mother, you are quite impressive.\u201dRong Yuanyin then smiled complacently.The other five disciples immediately jumped onto the contest field on hearing their names.Seeing only five of them, the host of the competition cried, \u201cRong Yi from Tianxu Peak! Come up! Or you are out!\u201dSomeone who knew about Rong Yi\u2019s situation asked, \u201cDeacon Yu, did you make a mistake? That Rong Yi from Tianxu Peak has no spiritual root. How is he supposed to compete?\u201dDeacon Yu just ignored his words and said, \u201cIs Rong Yi from Tianxu Peak here? Hurry up!\u201dRong Yi then turned to Bu Qi and asked, \u201cI suppose that Rong Yi they are talking about is me. Why would I get enlisted?\u201dBu Qi was also not clear what was going on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wouldn\u2019t go up there?\u201d\u201cRight, plus he is still pregnant. What if he hurts the baby when he competes?\u201dThose disciples around all laughed out loud, \u201cThat\u2019s no horrible. The most horrible thing is he would say he is gonna give birth to the baby while fighting.\u201dNow everybody was laughing even harder!Seeing those people were all making fun of him, Rong Yi narrowed his eyes.And at this time someone saw Rong Yi, he immediately pointed at him, \u201cRong Yi is there.\u201dThen everyone looked over to him, \u201cSenior Rong, the deacon is calling you. What are you waiting for?\u201d\u201cHe has no spiritual root. He is only asking for death if he goes up.\u201d\u201cHum! If it were me, I would go up there even if I don\u2019t own spiritual root. I can\u2019t let others belittle me.\u201d\u201cHow could he be compared with you! He is a coward!\u201dOn hearing that they were gossiping about his daddy, Yin Tao shouted unhappily, \u201cMy daddy is not a coward!\u201d\u201cIf he is not a coward, then let him compete.\u201d After the disciple who was talking found that Yin Tao resembled Rong Yi, he immediately added, \u201cAlas, this kid looks exactly like senior Rong. Is he that freak senior Rong has given birth to?\u201dOn hearing someone called Yin Tao a freak, Rong Yi showed some kind of murderous look. After putting the kid in Bu Qi\u2019s arms, he said, \u201cTake care of my little Cherry.\u201dBu Qi was worried, \u201cMaster Shifu, are you really going?\u201d\u201cThat disciple said right. I can not let them belittle me.\u201d Rong Yi went to the side of the field, trying to climb up, only finding it was higher than expected. Besides, he was holding such a big belly. It was really not convenient to jump onto it.He then turned around, \u201cBu Qi, come here. Lend me your palm.\u201dOn hearing that, everybody laughed out loud again, \u201cHe can\u2019t even get onto the field. What a loser!\u201dYin Tao said grumpily, \u201cMy daddy is not a loser!\u201dBu Qi moved forward and pushed him up holding his girdle and easily sent him onto the field.Seeing that he got up, Wei Wenxiao felt thrilled, \u201cMom, look, he is up! He is up there!\u201dRong Yuanyin sneered, \u201cChang Fuming from Jingxu Sect is his sworn enemy. He wouldn\u2019t go easy on him.\u201dRong Yi then walked to the disciple who said his son was a freak, \u201cI demand you to apologize.\u201dThat disciple was confused, \u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cFor that you said my son is a freak.\u201d\u201cOK. If you win, I will apologize to him.\u201d That disciple pursed his lips and then continued, \u201cHow about this? If you can win, it is not a problem even if you ask me to kneel down and offer tea to him.\u201dRong Yi sneered, \u201cHe is Immortal Yunyi\u2019s little disciple, which means he is also your grand master. Of course you should kneel to offer him tea.\u201dHe was not a tolerant person. Since the other party had already crossed the line first, he would be a fool if he didn\u2019t use the privilege of little Yin Tao as Immortal Yunyi\u2019s disciple.That disciple\u2019s expression changed a bit, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dOthers all looked at each other, speechless.Some disciple said, \u201cI heard it\u2019s true.\u201dSome disciple patted on the disciple who claimed to kneel to offer the tea with a pitiful look, \u201cGuo Rui, it seems whether senor Rong wins or not, you should offer the tea for sure.\u201dGuo Ru gritted his teeth, \u201cExcept offering tea, I\u2019m gonna kowtow to him to apologize.\u201d\u201cThen be a man of your words.\u201d Rong Yi snorted and then walked into the middle of the field.Chang Fuming pointed at Rong Yi with his sword, \u201cRong Yi, I won\u2019t show mercy for that you got no spiritual root. And also for the old hatred.\u201dThat year the chief asked those disciples of Qi Practicing to the magic weapon warehouse to choose their own magic weapons. He fancied a sword giving off blue light on the first sight and even thought it should have been refined for him. But Rong Yi also fancied it and wanted it, thought Rong Yi was not qualified to choose his own magic weapon, but Bai Yunchen could. After hearing Rong Yi said he liked it, Bai Chen took it away for him. Since among all the peers, Bai Yunchen was the most powerful one, plus his cultivation speed was the fastest, the chief gave him the privilege to choose his favorite magic weapon first.And then instead of comforting him, his master said he was not capable enough and could only swallow it. He also had to admit that Bai Yunchen was really a rare talent for cultivation. He had already promoted to Golden Elixir phase while he himself was still on level 9 of Qi Practicing.\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was wondering how many people the original owner had offended.\u201cRong Yi, show your magic weapon.\u201dThose disciples down there all made fun of him, \u201cHis magic weapon? Even if he has one, does he have spiritual power to activate it?\u201dSome disciple asked, \u201cSenior Rong, should I borrow you an ordinary sword?\u201dAnother disciple beside him asked, \u201cDo you even have an ordinary one?\u201d\u201cI got a toy sword which I planned to give to the newly recruited junior disciple as a present.\u201d\u201cSenior Rong, be careful. Don\u2019t hurt the baby in your belly. All the physicians are competing elixir refining. No one has time to deliver the baby for you.\u201dThen everyone burst into a laugher again.After scanning all of them, Rong Yi activated his magic bracelet with his spiritual power and then a beautiful light blue long sword showed up.Everybody was stunned.Rong Yi swayed the long sword in his hand and did some warm-up exercise. However, this body did not exercise all the year round, and its bones were very stiff. Even swaying the sword was a bit stiff.Bu Qi who was down there thought he was not like a new learner at all judging from the away he swayed his swords, but more like someone who hadn\u2019t used his swords for years, because his actions looked kind of rusty. But anyway, he felt much relieved since Rong Yi knew some swordplay.Some disciple murmured, \u201cDid I see it wrong? Senior Rong\u2019s sword has spiritual qi, and pretty dense, even better that senior Chang\u2019s level one elite magic weapon.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t make a mistake. His sword really has spiritual qi.\u201d\u201cHe has no spiritual root. How is he supposed to activate a sword with spiritual qi?\u201dEverybody was confused.At this time, the deacon shouted, \u201cThe competition begins!\u201d(Heads-up: I\u2019m really appreciated that so many readers like this book.

    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn hearing the deacon, Rong Yi didn\u2019t rush forward immediately. He stood at the spot where he swayed the sword, from being rusty and slow to being faster and faster and also more and more proficient, like he was gonna become one with it.A disciple down the field looked at Rong Yi surprisingly, \u201cIt seems senior Rong has spiritual power. Doesn\u2019t he have no spiritual root? Where does his spiritual power come from?\u201dOthers were all surprised.\u201cI heard in order to let Taiyuan Sect plant the spiritual root for senior Rong, senior Bai agreed to marry into Taiyuan Sect. But now senior Bai suddenly canceled it, maybe it was because he found a method to plant the spiritual root for senior Rong.\u201d\u201cYour words make sense. So this is all senior Bai\u2019s credit?\u201d\u201cEven if he has spiritual power, so what? Look! His spiritual power is so weak. It is nearly impossible for him to beat senior Chang who is at level nine of Qi Practicing.\u201dAfter casting a glance at those disciples, Rong Yi kept swaying his sword to practice.Seeing Rong Yi was swaying his swords faster and faster, Chang Fuming narrowed his eyes. He never knew that Rong Yi knew swordplay. But they were not competing swordplay anyway, so there was nothing to worry about.He then stabbed at Rong Yi holding his sword.Rong Yi then raised his sword to resist.Chang Fuming sped up!Rong Yi also sped up swaying his sword, like he had already seen through where the other party was gonna poke.Everybody looked at Rong Yi, eyes popped out.\u201cOh my! Senior Rong\u2019s sword is too fast that my eyes nearly can not catch up with it. His swordplay is no worse than his sword cultivation, besides, senior Chang even failed to break his magic weapon. What level on earth is his magic weapon?\u201d\u201cHis magic weapon is sending off weak light at the edge, much weaker than senior Chang\u2019s. Apparently it is one with no level, but its spiritual qi is much more dense than senior Chang\u2019s.\u201d\u201cHmm. It seems senior Rong\u2019s magic weapon is really not bad, which also makes up that his cultivation phase is lower than senior Chang.\u201dMagic weapon was also a key of a fight. That is why everyone is longing for a superb magic weapon and great equipment.Chang Fuming stared at the Rong Yi. He thought that he would be able to defeat Rong Yi with only one move. But after so many moves, Rong Yi was still standing there safe and sound. Except feeling surprised, he felt a stronger spur to defeat him.Wei Wenxiao and Rong Yuanyin also started to feel anxious. They also thought he would give Rong Yi a good beat. But Rong Yi just dealt with him easily.Bu Qi finally exhaled a sigh of relief. Judging from the present situation, Chang Fuming could not defeat his master shifu in a short time.Chang Fuming grinded his teeth. He then enchanted a spell and turned his magic weapon into ten swords.Rong Yi squinted. He was clear that he had lower spiritual power, not suitable for a long time fight. So he generated his magic bracelet again and brought out another sword. He then resisted with one sword, and swung the other at Chang Fuming.Chang Fuming was surprised and quickly dodged.Rong Yi didn\u2019t give him a chance to breathe, and stabbed at him again.His sword was fast, fierce and accurate. Everyone could tell he should have learned swordplay since he was young, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be so proficient of it.Chang Fuming quickly added a defending shield for himself. But just a few pricks, his arm got wounded.\u201cChang Fuming, you are really a loser! You can\u2019t even defeat someone who has just been at the entry level!\u201d Wei Wenxiao even had a spur to fight Rong Yi himself.Rong Yuanyin murmured, \u201cSince when has Rong Yi become so powerful? What has happened during the four years while he was not in the sect?\u201dWhile trying to get close to Chang Fuming, Rong Yi repelled his sword and then pushed him to a corner, leaving him no chance to fly his magic weapon at all. And then he accelerated his pace and pricked on him.Chang Fuming now even got no chance to fight back.Yin Tao shouted excitedly, \u201cDaddy, beat him. Daddy, beat him!\u201dRong Yi then turned back and gave him a smile.Everybody was staring at Rong Yi, jaws dropped.\u201cSince when senior Rong has become so capable?\u201d\u201cIs this person really that senior Rong?\u201dRong Yi suddenly stopped and said, \u201cSenior Chang, you should go change your robes.\u201dRight after his words, Chang Fuming\u2019s robes were like withering flowers with petals falling down. At last only his underpants left.\u201cAh!\u201d Those female disciples all screamed and hurriedly covered their eyes, \u201cSo embarrassing.\u201dYin Tao also covered his little face like other female disciples did, \u201cSo embarrassing. So embarrassing.\u201dBu Qi couldn\u2019t help rubbing his little head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChang Fuming felt kind of cool, and instantly looked down.Taking this opportunity, Rong Yi hit on Chang Fuming\u2019s chest with the handle of his sword and swept him off the field.All disciples exclaimed.They never expected the one who would get defeated was Chang Fuming.The deacon was also surprised and looked over towards Rong Yuanyin.Bu Qi followed his eyes\u2019 direction and reminded him, \u201cDeacon Yu, according to the rules, the one who got blown off the arena loses.\u201dSince it was really inappropriate to let him climb back in front of so many people, Deacon Yu could only announce that Chang Fuming lost.\u201cI didn\u2019t lose. I didn\u2019t lose.\u201d Chang Fuming rushed to the arena and yelled, as he was not resigned to lose to Rong Yi like that.Bu Qi then swept him away again by swinging his palm.Those disciples around all persuaded him, \u201cSenior Chang, you already got beaten off the arena. You\u2019d get punished if you get onto it again.\u201dChang Fuming yelled, \u201cRong Yi got lower spiritual level. He got no chance to win over me. Rong Yi, let\u2019s have another fight. I will definitely beat you.\u201d\u201cSenior Chang, he won only because he got a better magic weapon.\u201d Those disciples all persuaded him.Rong Yi then walked before Guo Rui, pointed at him with the sword, saying with a cold voice, \u201cApologize to my son.\u201dLooking at the point of his sword glittering with cold light under the sun, Guo Rui couldn\u2019t help swallowing some saliva.One of his senior brothers pulled his sleeve and said in a low voice, \u201cHis son is the little disciple of Immortal Yunyi, our grand uncle master shifu. Apologize if you still wanna stay.\u201dGuo Rui\u2019s legs immediately turned into jello, and he instantly kneeled in front of Yin Tao, saying while kowtowing hard, \u201cGrand uncle master shifu, I am sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that to you\u2026\u201dThose disciples who were competing in another arena also looked over to them on hearing the noise.\u201cWhat is going on out there?\u201d\u201cIt seems someone is kneeling down to apologize.\u201d\u201cTo whom?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. You can go ask someone.\u201dWithin an hour, everyone on site knew that Rong Yi not only had spiritual root but also defeat a disciple who was at level 9 of Qi Practicing with his superb swordsmanship.Bai Yunchen who was competing in the Golden Elixir competition field also heard the news, frowning. No one knew his junior brother better than him. His junior brother had never laid a finger on swords, so he would never have such superb swordplay. They should make a mistake. Maybe he should ask about it after the competition.Of course the chief and elders also saw everything on the competition field of those disciple at Qi Practicing phase..Elder Jiuqing said, \u201cI remember that pregnant disciple is the leader of Tianxu Peak\u2019s son Rong Yi.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s him.\u201d Elder Jiumen frowned, \u201cHow is it possible the disciple who only brings shame to Nine Void Sect suddenly owns spiritual power?\u201dThe chief said faintly, \u201cAfter the competition, I\u2019ll send someone to investigate it.\u201dAfter Guo Rui\u2019s kowtowing, Rong Yi immediately asked Bu Qi to leave, because if they didn\u2019t leave now, more competitions would be waiting for him.Noticing Rong Yi was leaving, Wei Wenxiao was so angry that he even wanted to chop someone with his sword, \u201cMother, now everyone knows he has spiritual power.\u201dRong Yuanyin tried to comfort him, \u201cTake it easy. He is only at Qi Practicing phase. We have plenty of opportunities to kill him. Actually it\u2019s not a bad thing that he survived. We can still explore where his father has hid those precious ingredients.\u201dOn hearing his mother, Wei Wenxiao felt much more relieved.After Rong Yi and others left the site, Yin Tao shouted excitedly, \u201cDaddy is awesome! Daddy is awesome! I also want to learn swordplay.\u201dRong Yi smiled, \u201cOK. I will teach after we get back. You should get up at 5 am to do horse stance.\u201dOn hearing he had to get up so early, Yin Tao immediately changed his tone, \u201cOh, then I quit.\u201dRong Yi was speechless.Fortunately he also had no intention to teach Yin Tao who didn\u2019t own the Blade Spiritual Root the swordplay. After all in the early stage of sword cultivation was too weak, and his little son might get bullied.Bu Qi then led them to fly over the gate of Nine Void Sect.For a very far distance, Rong Yi already saw the carriage they had taken this morning..He couldn\u2019t help wearing a smile. So Yin Jinye really came to pick them up.On seeing them, Rong Su who was sitting on the roof immediately said to Yin Jinye who was sitting inside, \u201cMy lord, they are back.\u201dThen Bu Qi flew the sword before the carriage.Rong Su quickly picked the kid up from his hands, \u201cLittle young master, is everything OK?\u201dYin Tao nodded, \u201cI have smelted a chrysanthemum for daddy today.\u201d\u201cWow! You are impressive!\u201d Rong Su didn\u2019t ask his rank but only praised him, and then slipped the boy into the carriage.Seeing Yin Jinye was inside, Yin Tao\u2019s eyes were beaming. He then threw himself into his arms, \u201cFather, father, when I was competition, I have refined a chrysanthemum-shape magic weapon for daddy and master Yunyi used it to defeat someone else. Isn\u2019t my magic weapon awesome? Daddy is also awesome. He swung his sword, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, then blew someone down and even tore that guy\u2019s robes into pieces, only his underpants left. Haha\u2026\u201dSeeing he was never ready to stop, Yin Jinye picked up a piece of cake and stuffed into his mouth.Those pastries were prepared by Rong Su, saying Rong Yi might be hungry.Before Yin Tao who was starving swallowed the piece in his mouth, he already took another piece.Outside the carriage, Rong Su asked Rong Yi, \u201cYoung master, have you passed the test?\u201dRong Yi gave Bu Qi a look, \u201cIt\u2019s like a piece of cake.\u201d\u201cSure, our young master is so impressive, of course you would be qualified.\u201d Rong Su then supported him to get onto the carriage, \u201cYoung master, come on. I have prepared you some pastries.\u201dRong Yi was also starving, \u201cYou are so sweet!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRong Yi immediately scrambled for the food with his son once he got into the carriage.Looking at this pair of father and son gobbling like that, Yin Jinye couldn\u2019t help picking his good-looking sword-shape eyebrows.Seeing there was only one last piece of pastries on the plate, Rong Yi quickly grabbed in in his hand.Yin Tao looked at him pitifully with that pair of innocent big eyes.\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Rong Yi shook it in front of him.Yin Tao immediately nodded.Rong Yi then put it beside his mouth.Yin Tao then opened his mouth happily.But Rong Yi did not stuff it into his mouth. Instead, he withdrew his hand a bit, and Yin Tao stretched out his neck a bit. Then Rong Yi again withdrew his hand a bit more, Yin Tao failed again and stretched out his neck a bit more.Rong Yi then instantly took it back and stuffed it into his own mouth, \u201cHmm, yummy.\u201dYin Tao was thunderstruck and then threw himself into Rong Yi\u2019s chest angrily, \u201cDaddy, bad.\u201dRong Yi couldn\u2019t help laughing.Looking at those father and son huddling together, Yin Jinye shook his head, thinking Rong Yi was really too childish, which also was why Yin Tao so clingy to him.Suddenly Rong Yi cried, \u201cAh! You damn silly kid! You bit my chest again!\u201dFortunately he got defending armor, so the kid could not bite through it.Rong Yi then spanked Yin Tao a bit hard, and then lifted him by the collar and let him kneel before a corner of the wall to reflect on himself, saying with a very serious tone, \u201cNext time if you bite my chest again without my approving, you\u2019ll have to reflect on yourself for three whole days, no food, no sleep.\u201dYin Tao called him in a low and pitiful voice, \u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use even if you beg your father!\u201dYin Tao could his daddy was really pissed off this time and dare not move a bit.Yin Jinye thought Rong Yi did a right thing to punish the kid when he did something wrong, saying, \u201cHow was the test today?\u201dRong Yi smiled at him while rubbing his chest, \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t ask me about today\u2019s thing.\u201dSeeing Yin Jinye was about to pick up his book, he immediately sat next to him, \u201cMy spiritual root has hidden attributes, so common tests would not find it. Even I myself couldn\u2019t have found its presence if I hadn\u2019t checked my body carefully last time. So that was why I was not qualified when the disciple used the crystal stone to test me. Then Bu Qi used a Hundred-color Ball to test me and found that I got mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root. Hum! I had planned to take this opportunity to let them remove my name from Nine Void Sect. But now it is impossible.\u201dThen he leaned forward to Yin Jinye whispered into his ear, \u201cActually not just mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root, I also possess other spiritual roots. But I won\u2019t tell you now. I\u2019ll let you find it yourself. This way you will pay more attention to me.\u201dThe hot air when Rong Yi spoke flew into Yin Jinye\u2019s ear, like a feather tickling his heart, making him kind of turned on in his down part.Yin Jinye was a little uncomfortable of being so intimate with someone else, so he raised his hand and pushed Rong Yi\u2019s face away.Rong Yi said sullenly, \u2018What are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou were too close.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s some pillow talk, of course I should get close enough, otherwise they may hear me.\u00a0 But if I am too low, you might not hear me.\u201d\u201cOf course I can hear you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Rong Yi looked into Yin Jinye\u2019s eyes, lips moving a bit.Seeing he didn\u2019t say a word for some time, Yin Jinye showed a slice of confusion in his eyes.Rong Yi asked, \u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis guy said nothing at all, OK?Rong Yi picked his eyebrows, \u201cDid you hear me? Didn\u2019t you say you can hear me however low I am?\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe could not read his mind!Rong Yi then put his hands on his shoulder smilingly, \u201cI told you to be closer so you could hear me clearly.\u201dYin Jinye then gave him a cold look.Rong Yi grinned and continued, \u201cI have encountered a bunch of relatives at Nine Void Sect, they either look down on me, or want to explore where my father has hidden his previous ingredients from me. I\u2019d father cut the connections with those relatives. If any of them comes here to look for me, don\u2019t let them in, Asu, do you hear me?\u201dHe thought the original owner\u2019s relatives were all stupid. Isn\u2019t it convenient to bring the ingredients with them since they got Storage Rings? Why would Rong Weiyi (the original Rong Yi\u2019s father) hide them somewhere?On hearing his order, Rong Su who was sitting on the roof of the car said, \u201cYeah, got it.\u201dRong Yi then continued, \u201cI also encountered another bad thing. I got chased after by disciples of Taiyuan Sect. Then we accidentally came to the competition field in a hurry and I got rolled to compete on the arena without a reason. Now thinking it back, I bet there must be someone behind it who wants to get me killed, otherwise for someone who has just passed the test would have no right to join the competition at all. But who would it be?\u201dOh right, he remembered when he was fighting, he heard some disciple said that the reason Bai Yunchen agreed to marry into Taiyuan Sect was they promised to plant the spiritual root for him. So this Bai Yunchen was really good to the original owner. Even his biological brother wouldn\u2019t sacrifice this much for him.Yin Jinye asked, \u201cThen why would Taiyuan Sect try to put you down?\u201d\u201cBecause they think Bai Yunchen canceled the engagement because of me.\u201dRong Su who was sitting on the roof cried, \u201cSenior brother Bai has canceled the engagement?\u201dIs it possible the young master and Bai Yunchen has rekindled the past feelings?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then if someone was after him, he could at least deal with it himself. But now with this big belly, it was really not convenient.Rong Hun cast a glance at his belly, \u201cThe little master in your belly should be as big as a six months\u2019 old baby now, so your belly is bigger than a normal pregnant person.\u201dRong Yi was surprised, \u201cHow is it possible?\u201d\u201cHe could have been come to this world together with little master Yin Tao, but due to some accident, he could only keep staying in there and grow slowly.\u201dThree years\u2019 time? Only as big as a six month old baby? Man! It is slow, OK?Rong Yi then asked, \u201cIf I practice my swordplay every morning, will it affect him?\u201d\u201cAfter having taken the pregnancy nutrition elixir, it\u2019d be no problem even if you have eight hundred rounds of fight.\u201d\u201cAll right, then I will start practicing my swordplay tomorrow.\u201dBefore the sun rose the next day, Rong Yi already got up and came into the yard. He held his sword and did some warm-ups.Xinghe, who was meditating on the roof, say that he was just swaying his sword casually, he thought Rong Yi had no sword cheats. When he was considering whether he should go teach him some moves, Rong Yi made a neat turnback and pricked onto the ground. Holding that big belly, his leg moves were not very agile but graceful, and deliberate. The swords combined with his body, his body combined with his qi, and his qi combined with his temperament, unlike a new learner at all.As Xinghe watched, he had a spur to compete his swordplay with Rong Yi. But then he felt that a dense strong stream of qi was gathering around Rong Yi. For those who were at higher phase of cultivation, it was just a stream of sword qi. But to those cultivators who were at the same level of Rong Yi, his sword qi was extremely powerful. As the sword rose and fell, one could fell some kind of invisible wave. Without touching the ground, it already left swords marks. Even those trees around were rustling due to the strong sword qi.On hearing the noise, Yin Jinye who was meditating in the room got up and moved to the window.Pity that Rong Yin just finished and withdrew his sword.Holding his big belly, he walked into the pavilion and sat down, exhaled a big breath. Carrying the baby, only some light action and he already could barely breathe. He needed to practice more.Seeing Xinghe who was on the roof, Rong Yi called him, \u201cXinghe.\u201dXinghe then jumped off, \u201cYoung master, what is it?\u201d\u201cI am hungry. Ask them to bring the food here. Oh right, I feel hungrier this morning, so ask them to make more food.\u201dXinghe was lazy and directly shouted at the direction of the kitchen with his spiritual power, \u201cThe young master is hungry. Take the breakfast here in the pavilion.\u201dSoon someone replied, \u201cGot it.\u201dRong Yi then turned to Yin Jinye\u2019s room, seeing he was again holding a book, so he asked Xinghe curiously, \u201cWhy does your lord like reading so much? Is it really so enjoyable?\u201dHaving transmigrated into this world, he knew that most characters were complexformed characters he could mostly recognize. While the book Yin Jinye read used seal characters, which were hard for him to read.Xinghe said, \u201cActually our lord is not reading, he is looking for something. He couldn\u2019t understand the content in it, so he could only kept reading again and again, hoping he could unscramble it someday.\u201dRong Yi wiped off his cold sweat with the back of his hand, \u201cSo you also don\u2019t know what\u2019s written in it?\u201dXinghe said helplessly, \u201cEven the lord doesn\u2019t understand, how would we servants know?\u201d\u201cIs it really so complicated and hard to understand?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cWhat is looking for? Is it very important to him?\u201dXinghe looked at Rong Yi and said hesitantly, \u201cThe master is looking for Spring Hell Flower, but he has no idea where those flowers grow.\u201dRong Yi paused a bit, \u201cSpring Hell Flower?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRong Yi tried to confirm again, \u201cYou really mean QUAN-YIN-FLOWER?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dRong Yi frowned, \u201cI remember Spring Hell Flower could repair one\u2019s damaged soul, something very nutritious for ghost cultivators, because it could not only improve a ghost cultivator\u2019s cultivation, but also heal a severely injured ghost cultivator, and even could prolong one\u2019s life. Is your master injured?\u201dRight after he said those words, Yin Jinye instantly showed up in front of Rong Yi, \u201cYou know Spring Hell Flowers?\u201dRong Yiu snorted slightly, \u201cI told you I am wealthy in knowledge. I have read over hundreds of thousands of volumes of books. But you don\u2019t believe it. What can I say?\u201dYin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe could barely recognize characters, who would believe he was wealthy in knowledge???Xinghe, \u201c\u2026\u201dIs this person praising himself?Even those famous litterateurs would at most read hundreds of volumes of books the whole life while he claimed he had read I have read over hundreds of thousands of volumes of books? Did this man know what he was saying?Yin Jinye still didn\u2019t believe Rong Yi\u2019s words, so he asked, \u201cDo you know what Spring Hell Flower looks like?\u201dRong Yi thought a bit, \u201cIts shape is like the dragon claw, also like an umbrella. In the middle it is round. The petals are as thin as a needle, as red as blood. During daytime, it would make some sound like ghost\u2019s howling, very creepy. And at night it could conjure ghosts.\u201dIn Rong Family they had a few. Pity that none was at the master level, but only some dried flowers.Yin Jinye and Xinghe both looked at Rong Yi, jaws dropped. Though no book had ever described the complete shape of the flower, what Rong Yi said was almost the same as said in the book.Rong Yi really knew about Spring Hell Flower!Xinghe hurriedly asked, \u201cYoung master, do you know where they grow?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOf course. The reason why it is called Spring Hell Flower, first, it has the meaning of leading to the netherworld, and second, the flower has the yin soul of human.\u201d Rong Yi then continued while shaking his head, \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to find.\u201dYin Jinye then sat by his side, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cIt grows on the corpse of a cultivator. But not every dead cultivator could grow it. The dead cultivator should possess heavy grievance, and there should be residual soul left in the corpse. The residual soul with no sense would combine with the heavy grievance and grow into a red flower. The higher cultivation level the cultivator was at, the higher level of the flower. If one wants to improve his cultivation or uses it to cure some disease or injuries, the precondition is the cultivation level of the dead cultivator should be below that person.\u201d\u201cNo wonder the book says left foot in mortal world while right foot in netherworld. So it means half soul goes into hell while the other half is left in mortal world. But why doesn\u2019t the book tell it grows on a cultivator\u2019s body?\u201d Xinghe looked at Rong Yi, confused.\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? The one who wrote the book wanted people to know about the presence and uses of Spring Hell Flower, but at the same time, he also didn\u2019t want the ghost cultivators to use it to improve their cultivation with it in case he/she would do evil to the world after he/she gets much stronger. So he could only hide part of it.\u201dXinghe really had an impulse to dig the writer\u2019s tomb and whip his corpse, \u201cThen how did you know it?\u201d\u201cI have read a lot of books, you know. It\u2019s a natural thing that I read about it in other books.\u201d\u201cThe cultivator had to have higher cultivation level than ourd lord when he was alive, and could also grow a Spring Hell Flower. That is too harsh. I even doubt \u00a0if there is such corpse in this world.\u201dRong Yi looked at Yin Jinye curiously, \u201cTell me your level and so you could have my knees.\u201dYin Jinye said lightly, \u201cWandering Immortal.\u201dThe last phase of a cultivator was doom overpowering phase. If one could overpower his doom, he could become an immortal. But if failed, one would perish and turn into a wandering immortal and keep cultivating. A wandering immortal\u2019s cultivation is higher than any other cultivator who was in the Doom Overpowering phase. But a wandering immortal had to overcome a sea of troubles to overpower his doom. One had to overpower much more dooms, and every time the thunder would be more dreadful every time one tried to overpower the doom. One even had to be prepared to turn to ashes. But if one could overcome them all, one could directly become a genuine immortal.\u201cWandering immortal? Seriously?!\u201d Rong Yi thought Yin Jinye could only be at Soul Refining phase or Void Purifying phase. But it turned out he was a wandering immortal! He couldn\u2019t help screaming and threw himself at Yin Jinye, holding his arm tightly, \u201cDaddy, I am all yours. I am all yours for the rest of my life. You can never abandon me. You can never abandon me and our sons.\u201dSo his initial assumption was right. This person could definitely bring him back to his modern world.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dXinghe poofed, thinking Rong Yi was really funny.Rong Yi then instantly raised his head and leaned on Yin Yinjin\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It is easy to find corpse having higher cultivation thank you.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Yin Jinye looked down at him, \u201cI am all ears.\u201d\u201cWe can go dig their ancestors\u2019 tombs of those big sects, better be sects of ghost cultivation, beast cultivation or evil cultivation. They have the strongest grievance because they were very reluctant to leave this world. So it is easier to grow Spring Hell Flower on their bodies.\u201dRong Family had found Spring Hell Flower in others\u2019 ancestors\u2019 tomb.\u201cIs it appropriate to dig other\u2019s ancestor\u2019s tombs?\u201d Xinghe really admired Rong Yi. He could even come up with such villainous way. But for the lord, they could only take the chance.But if someone knew about this, they would be chased after by many sects.Rong Yi then said, \u201cThere\u2019s some other methods. We can find a mysterious realm left by an earth immortal or wandering immortal. Usually earth immortals and wandering immortals would hide their own bodies in their own mysterious realms. But they often die peacefully, so there is only a slight chance they could grow out Spring Hell Flower. Besides, most mysterious realms are floating everywhere, and with all kinds of traps inside. It\u2019s not worthy for us to take such a big risk.\u201dNow Yin Jinye really had to reexamine Rong Yi, because he really knew a lot of things.After giving it some thoughts, Xinghe thought they could only dig other\u2019s ancestor\u2019s tombs.Suddenly Rong Yi thought of something and couldn\u2019t help frowning, \u201cWhat worries me is if the will of the one who takes the Flower is not firm enough, it is possible that he would be controlled by the residual grievance and soul in it.\u201dYin Jinye said with a low voice, \u201cI won\u2019t let them control me.\u201dXinghe said, \u201cI will ask them to pry into the ancestor tombs of other sects now.\u201dYin Jinye didn\u2019t object.Rong Yi then asked Yin Jinye, \u201cCan you tell me why you want the Flower? To improve your cultivation or cure your injuries or mend your soul?\u201dSince he already knew it was he who was looking for Spring Hell Flower, Yin Jinye didn\u2019t need to hide it from him, \u201cI failed to overpower my doom and got severely injured. Although it\u2019s nothing serious, I still need the Flower to recuperate so I can resist the thunder doom next time.After thinking for a bit, Rong Yi said, \u201cI got a prescription. Though not so efficient like Spring Hell Flower, I can guarantee that it can consolidate your body and decrease the harm that the thunder strike does to you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So tell them to find as many herbs as they could.\u201dYin Jinye glanced at the list on the paper, frowning. He always had a feeling that Rong Yi was unreliable, because he had never heard that high level herbs could mix with low level herbs. Besides, Rong Yi was only at level one of Qi Practicing and he was not an elixir refiner at all, how was he supposed to know the prescriptions of level nine elixirs? He thought he must be insane to choose to trust Rong Yi.\u201cSee if there\u2019s any mistake.\u201d Yin Jinye passed the prescription to him.Rong Yi quickly leafed it through and said, \u201cNothing wrong. You need to write down the refining method and do every step as I told you.\u201dAfter writing down the steps Rong Yi told him, Yin Jinye went back to his room and called, \u201cYin Yan!\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d Then a shadow jumped into the room through the window, \u201cWhat\u2019s the instruction?\u201d\u201cSee if this prescription could really temper one\u2019s mortal body.\u201d Yin Jinye passed the prescription to him.\u201dAfter scanning it fast, a slice of astonishment flashed in Yin Yan\u2019s eyes, \u201cSeen from those herbs they could indeed strengthen the body. But I have never heard that someone could refine elixirs mixing high level herbs and low level herbs, because the high level herbs would overshadow the low level herbs\u2019 properties, so low level herbs would lose their efficacy. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t mix the low level herbs in it at all. But the refining method is a little abnormal, so maybe we got a chance.\u201dThe more he said, the more excited he became, \u201cAnyway, I want to have a try.\u201dSeeing he was so excited, Yin Jinye nodded, \u201cYou can go.\u201d\u201cThen I am leaving, master.\u201dYin Jin moved to the window and saw that Rong Su came out holding Yin Tao to have breakfast with Rong Yi. He remembered that Rong Yi had asked him to be with them more often, so he went out for them.On seeing his Savior Yin was coming, Rong Yi immediately filled a bowl of meat porridge for him.Yin Jinye had been fasting, so he just ate a little.Rong Yi looked up to Rong Su, \u201cAsu, buy a pad of blank rune papers for me later.\u201d\u201cNo need. I got a lot here.\u201d Rong Su then took out piles of rune papers and put them on the table. Then he saw that Rong Yi was eating porridge one bowl after another and stuffed a few plates of pastries, he was surprised, \u201cYoung master, why do you eat so much today?\u201dRong Yi patted his belly, \u201cAsk him.\u201dRong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter eating all the food on the table, Rong Yi said, \u201cGet Bu Qi here for me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSoon enough Bu Qi came, with Xiang Lv following.Rong Yi asked Bu Qi, \u201cHow is your rune engraving going now?\u201dBu Qi said, \u201cI have practiced the whole night but still burn it easily.\u201dRong Yi then took up a piece of rune paper, \u201cSee how I engrave.\u201dBu Qi and Xiang Lv immediately stayed focused.In order to let Bu Qi see it clearly, Rong Yi held a rune paper with a hand, and generated his spiritual power with the other, from which popped out some aubergine thunder fire instantly. But the fire was weak while the thunder was strong.He first balanced them and then got close to the rune paper, then punched through the yellow rune paper like embroidering with thunder thread without burning the paper, back and forth like embroidering a flower. And soon the rune was engraved on the paper.Then Rong Yi swept over it with the red fire. And then an aubergine rune appeared on the paper. He then asked Bu Qi, \u201cDid you see it clearly?\u201dHe tried to teach Bu Qi because he needed him to do one thing for him.Bu Qi nodded, \u201cI think I still need practice.\u201dXiang Lv had ever heard from Bu Qi that one had to possess mutant Thunder-fire Spiritual Root to learn enchanting, so he felt depressed that why he only owned single Fire Spiritual Root, otherwise he could also learn enchanting from Rong Yi and others.\u201cMaster Shifu, can you send this rune to me as a gift?\u201dRong Yi nodded and handed it to him, \u201cMy spiritual power is not high enough, so I can only enchant level one or below magic weapons.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dRong Su then said, \u201cYoung master, send me one please.\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him, \u201cYou are at Base Practicing phase already. It doesn\u2019t work on you. I will give you some when I can enchant magic weapons of Base Practicing.\u201d\u201cBut when you can do that, maybe I have already made it to Golden Elixir phase.\u201dRong Yi was speechless and could only enchant one for him.Yin Tao also cried, \u201cDaddy, I want one too. I want one too.\u201dRong Yi brushed off his little hand, \u201cIf everyone asks one for free, how am I gonna make money? No, no!\u201dRong Yi was a little surprised, \u201cAh? Young master, are these for sale?\u201d\u201cYou tell me! Do you think I am making those for fun?\u201d Speaking of which, Rong Yi finished one more, \u201cIn a few days, the clothes shop is opening, and then I can put them in there for sale.\u201dYin Jinye cast a glance at Rong Su blandly and then asked Rong Yi, \u201cAre you out of money?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I never maltreated him I swear!\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him, \u201cWe are all cultivators.

So I want to make some more money when I still can for future expenditure.\u201dRong Su said, \u201cThe master\u2019s spiritual stones are enough for you.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t always ask his favor, right?\u201d Rong Yi frowned, \u201cSince now I still have the ability to earn some spiritual stones on my own, plus it doesn\u2019t consume much of my strength, why can\u2019t I support myself?\u201dEvery man on spot totally understood. He was just trying to support himself with his own hands. He didn\u2019t want to be taken as a woman living on a man, which would make him belittled by others.Xiang Lv said, \u201cFor your abilities, it\u2019s really a shame if you don\u2019t make money on your own. I bet one year later you will be the wealthiest man in Haishan City.\u201dThinking that even a prescription of Rong Yi could be sold at the price of a divine spiritual stone, let alone it was enchanting arts that was known to nobody. Of course he would make a big fortune!Rong Yi cupped his hands and said smilingly, \u201cYou flatter me. You flatter me. Actually my arm is to be the wealthiest man in Zhonghai Prefecture (Here is an exaggerating way by contrast with the former sentence you flatter me because Haishan City is attached to Zhonghai Prefecture).\u201dXiang Lv, \u201c\u2026\u201dRong Su said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough spiritual stones, please let me know.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Rong Yi then held Yin Jinye\u2019s hand on the table.Yin Jinye looked at him, perplexed.Rong Yi then said to everyone smilingly, \u201cAnyone who wants to go shopping with me put up your hand!\u201dHe then instantly raised Yin Jinye\u2019s hand.Yin Jinye\u2019s mouth twitched.Rong Yi smiled at him, \u201cDaddy, you are so good.\u201dRong Su laughed in spite of himself, thinking the young master was really cunning. He knew that the lord wouldn\u2019t go with, so he chose to take the initiative.\u201cDaddy, daddy, I want to go too. I want to go too.\u201d Yin Tao raised his hand high enough, for fear that Rong Yi wouldn\u2019t see him.Rong Yi patted his shoulder and said, \u201cYou should go to the school. I will take you when you are off school.\u201dYin Tao pouted, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go to school.\u201d\u201cBut you have to!\u201d Rong Yi took up a rune paper and asked him, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s written on it?

Aren\u2019t you afraid you senior brothers may laugh at you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Of course Yin Tao didn\u2019t feel like being laughed at.\u201cGood. Su Gu, send little Cherry to school now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Su Gu then jumped off the roof, held up Yin Tao and left.Rong Su then asked curiously, \u201cYoung master, I also don\u2019t know the words on it. What are they?\u201dRong Yi rolled his eyes at him, \u201cApparently these are not words. I was tricking little Cherry to go to school. How could you also fall for it?\u201dRong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dXiang Lv couldn\u2019t help laughing.Rong Yi also curled up his lips. After watching Rong Yi stick those rune papers all over the whole mansion, he and Xiang Lv went back to their own yard.Rong Yi also went back to change his clothes. When he and Yin Jinye walked to the gate, suddenly a shadow pounced at them.Yin Jinye tossed his sleeve and swept the other party away.Rong Yi noticed it was a simply dressed old woman.The old woman didn\u2019t pick herself up, but only crying and complaining lying there, \u201cRong Yi, you are so heartless. I am your grandma! How could you let him push me over? My son is gone, so everyone ignores me! All your Rong family are assholes!\u201dGrandma???Rong Yi frowned. Yesterday he saw that the original owner\u2019s relatives were all from Nine Void Sect and all well-dressed. How could he have such a shabby grandma?\u201cWeiyi, Weiyi, my son, where have you been?\u201d Xu Youlian cried hard, \u201cWithout you here, even your son doesn\u2019t care about me now\u2026\u201dSome kind-hearted passer-by held him up and scolded Rong Yi and Yin Jinye.\u201cReally an asshole!

How would he have time to care about his grandma?\u201dYin Jinye scanned those passers-by indifferently and then said to Rong Yi, \u201cWho is she?\u201dRong Su then said, \u201cMaster, her name is Xu Youlian, the young master\u2019s old flame. Since she possesses no cultivation talent, the young master\u2019s grandpa didn\u2019t marry him. But he accidentally got her pregnant and she gave birth to the young master\u2019s father. For the sake that the kid had cultivation talent, the young master\u2019s grandpa found a place in a town near Haishan City and sent him some spiritual stones every five years. But after the young master\u2019s grandpa got married, he cut his connections with her and never sent him spiritual stones. And then she married some other man and had a son a daughter. As filial as the young master\u2019s father is, he still sent her spiritual stones and food every five years. Pity that she is a total gamester and would lose all the spiritual stones every time.

It\u2019s just you come without being invited, and even wouldn\u2019t ask the servant to inform that you are here.

Invite her in and let her have a good rest.\u201dOn hearing him, Xu Youlian immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m not going in. Who knows what you would do to such a weak old woman like me if I go in? I don\u2019t wanna die in there.\u201dRong Yi then lowered his eyes, looking pretty seemingly upset, \u201cI never know you would miss me so much, which really makes sad. Asu, since my grandma doesn\u2019t want to go in, give her a bag of upper grade spiritual stones and find her a decent place to settle down. Oh by the way, find two good maids to serve her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want your spiritual stones either.\u201dRong Su really couldn\u2019t take it, \u201cYou don\u2019t want this, you don\u2019t want that! What do you want, huh? You said we mistreat you! It\u2019s you who are being unreasonable!\u201dEven those passers-by now also thought Xu Youlian was being unreasonable now. Her grandson invited her and gave her spiritual stones and even got her servant girls, but she just didn\u2019t want this and didn\u2019t want that! What on earth did she want?Noticing the crowd were all taking Rong Yi\u2019s side, Xu Youlian argued, \u201cRong Yi, are you taking me as a fool, or a beggar? Do you think some spiritual stones can make me go? Rong Yi, let me tell you. No way! If you don\u2019t spare half of the ingredients my son has left, this is never over!\u201dRong Yi sneered in his heart. As expected, she was here for those precious ingredients, \u201cGrandma, who told you my father left those ingredients to me?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t concern you. As Weiyi\u2019s mother, I have the right to take a share of the ingredients he has left.\u201d\u201cBut my dad didn\u2019t leave me anything when he left.\u201d Rong Yi thought if Rong Weiyi had really left some top ingredients to the original owner, the original owner wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this, even having not a single spiritual stone on him.\u201cYou liar! You just don\u2019t want to share it with me!\u201d Xu Youlian screamed and even rushed towards Rong Yi, trying to snap his robes, but got stopped by Rong Su.Rong Yi then asked her back, \u201cI lied to you? So did you see my dad has given the ingredients to me with your own eyes or hear that he has left those things to me?\u201dXu Youlian, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSince you didn\u2019t see or hear my dad has left the ingredients to me, what makes you say that I lied to you? Only because of a few words from others? You\u2019d rather trust those nobodies instead of your own grandson? You came to denounce your own grandson for some fictitious gossip? Don\u2019t you know what you did is really like stabbing my heart with a knife?\u201d\u201cNo way! They would never lie to me.\u201dRong Yi snorted slightly, \u201cThey? Who are they in your mouth? Why did they tell you I got the ingredients if they didn\u2019t mean to sow discord between us?\u201dXu Youlian was struck dumb.\u201cMom, mom, mom, are you all right?\u201d A woman who resembled Xu Youlian ran to hold her up, \u201cMom, I told you not to come. Since that person has received such a big sum of fortune and is living a comfortable life himself. How would he share half of it with you? Don\u2019t daydream! Come on. Let\u2019s go home.\u201dXu Youlian yelled at Rong Yi, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t give it to me, I will live here!\u201dYin Jinye hated such unreasonable people most, so he ordered Rong Su, \u201cArrange a place for her and send some people to serve her and let her eat all delicacies and wear only superb silk clothes and give him a hundred upper grade spiritual stones every month as pocket money, let her enjoy her old age in peace.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXu Youlian got tempted by the condition he provided.Her daughter pinched her below the sleeve and whispered, \u201cMom, we are here for the ingredients. Don\u2019t get tempted.\u201dXu Youlian then came to her sense and said hurriedly, \u201cNo, I only want the ingredients.\u201dRong Su said, \u201cOld madam, your son did not leave any ingredients for our young master, nor did he leave half a spiritual stone for our young master. Since he moved into the Yin mansion, all his expenses have been given by our lord. We do not expect you to trust us. However, if you refuse our young master\u2019s good intention this time, there\u2019d be no next time. This is kind of once-in-a-lifetime chance, you know.\u201dSome kindhearted passer-by also persuaded her, \u201cOld madam, even if you grandson has those ingredients, it\u2019s no better than that he assures you a good life. Think about it. Some day you are gonna run out of the money you get from those ingredients. But things would be different they support you. As long as you live, they have to support you and be filial to you. And you will never be short of spiritual stones.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xu Youlian wanted to say yes, but her daughter called her anxiously, \u201cMom\u2026\u201dXu Youlian hurriedly answered, \u201cNo\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t need them to support me. I only want the ingredients, or don\u2019t expect me to leave!\u201d\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t leave, then just leave her here.\u201d Rong Yi was sick of talking to her and went back into the mansion. He already lost the mood to go shopping.Others all thought she was being unreasonable, so all left.\u201cYou heartless son of a bitch\u2026\u201d Seeing they all went back into the mansion, she started to cry, but everyone just ignored her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Rong Yi and others all went into the hall, Rong Su immediately asked, \u201cYoung master, do we need to investigate who is behind this?\u201dRong Yi snorted, \u201cWho could it be expect Rong family?\u201dThe only thing that he was curious about was whether Rong family was really so short of ingredients. Anyway, the original owner\u2019s grandfather was a peak leader. Did he really need ingredients so badly that they had to keep pushing a junior of the family? Or maybe the original owner\u2019s father had hidden some important thing in the ingredients so Rong Family was desperate to find it?Rong Su asked, \u201cAre you still going out?\u201dRong Yi said with his head on the table, \u201cNo, my good mood is totally spoiled. I will go out when Qi Yueshi and others open their clothes shop.\u201dYin Jinye said, \u201cYou can ask Rong Su to buy things you wanted to buy.\u201dRong Yi gave him a casual look, \u201cI meant to go to the evil beast market with you to see if there is any good evil one.\u201d\u201cGiven your phase of cultivation, you may not be able to control them, or may even get hurt by them. So it\u2019s not suitable for you bring an evil beast by your side. Only those at higher phase than them could tame them.\u201dRong Yi said confidently, \u201cI know how to tame them without letting them hurt me a bit.\u201dRong Su then asked, \u201cYoung master, what kind of evil beast do you prefer?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026it doesn\u2019t have to be very powerful. Like you said, given my low phase of cultivation, I can\u2019t control those powerful ones. And not too big. Actually the smaller the better. It\u2019d be the best if it can hide in my robes or in my hair. So it could protect me better.\u201dRong Su blinked, \u201cWhat could such a tiny evil beast do? I can even crush it with a finger.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d said Rong Yi while yawning, \u201cI should go back to my room to cultivate. If there\u2019s no emergency, no one should disturb me.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dYin Jinye then gave Rong Su a look.Rong Su nodded and went out of the hall.After getting back to his own room, Rong Yi sat cross-legged and started to cultivate and didn\u2019t open his eyes until five days later. And he immediately felt his body was much lighter. He checked on his own body and found there was a sign of promoting. Cultivating for a few more days next time he could promote to level two of Qi Practicing.After walking out of his room, Yin Tao instantly threw himself into his arms, \u201cDaddy, you are out finally!\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cHow many days have I cultivated?\u201dYin Tao then stretched out a hand.\u201cSo many days already\u2026\u201d Suddenly Rong Yi recalled Xu Youlian, and asked Su Gu who was playing with Yin Tao, \u201cIs my grandma still outside?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d On hearing about that old woman, Su Gu couldn\u2019t help frowning, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave before she gets the ingredients. Now she even builds a bothy beside our gate and lives in it now.\u201d\u201cDaddy, it stinks there.\u201d Yin Tao complained.\u201cStinks?\u201d Rong Yi looked at Su Gu, confused.Su Rong said awkwardly, \u201cShe just poops and pees beside the bathy. Every time I pick the little master from school, we could smell the disgusting smell.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rong Yi was also speechless. People came and went on the road every day, as a woman, how could she even have the face to poop there? She was really shameless.\u201cYoung master, you are out.\u201d On seeing Rong Yi, Rong Su who had just come into the yard immediately ran out, \u201cI will ask the kitchen to prepare you some food.\u201dRong Yi sat in the pavilion and said casually, \u201cLittle Cherry, where is your father?\u201d\u201cHe is playing chess with my master shifu in the study. I will go call him.\u201d Yin Tao then started to run with that pair of cute short legs while shouting, \u201cFather, father, daddy is out. Daddy is out!\u201dYin Jinye who was playing chess just ignored Yin Tao and focused on the checkerboard. Only a few steps and he could win Lei Sai.Yin Tao rushed in and pulled his hand, \u201cFather, father, daddy is out. Let\u2019s go grab some food with daddy.\u201dYin Jinye still didn\u2019t talk to him.Yin Tao was too little to move him a bit, \u201cFather, father, daddy is out.\u201dYin Jinye said blandly, \u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cBut daddy said he missed you\u2026\u201d And this time Yin Tao pulled Yin Jinye out of his seat and they went out of the room.Only Lei Sai was left there staring at the chessboard, feeling kind of frustrated. Before his little disciple would call master shifu this and master shifu that. He was so close to him. But since Rong Yi had enchanted Yin Tao\u2019s magic weapon last time, little Yin Tao had completely changed. Now he called daddy this and daddy that. Every time he was off school, the first thing was to look for his daddy and totally ignored learning refining magic weapons from him. Now he just ignored him even after he saw him, but just pulled Yin Jinye away\u2026Alas! His status became lower and lower in this house!Yin Tao then pulled Yin Jinye to sit next to Rong Yi, then crawled onto Rong Yi\u2019s lap and leaned to his ear and whispered, \u201cDaddy, father has prepared you a big surprise.\u201d\u201cA surprise?\u201d said Rong Yi while turning to Yin Jinye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he had known, it couldn\u2019t be called a surprise.Then he directly asked Yin Jinye, \u201cOur son said you have prepared a surprise for me? What is it?\u201dActually he was more curious about why Yin Jinye suddenly thought of preparing him a surprise.Yin Jinye then gave Su Gu a look.\u201cI\u2019ll tell them to bring it now.\u201d said Su Gu smilingly while walking out.Later Rong Huan came in and took out a box out of his Storage Ring, \u201cYoung master, my lord, childe Qi and others sent a box of stuff, saying they are opening tomorrow and would like you to attend if you have time.\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cWhat did they send me?\u201d\u201cSome robes, saying that you should wear them if you go to their shop tomorrow.\u201dRong Huan opened the box. There were three suits of simple but noble purple robes, respectively for Rong Yin, Yin Tao and Yin Jinye. From the colors of the flowers embroidered to the decorative design, absolutely father-son style.Even Yin Jinye praised, which was rarely seen, \u201cNot bad.\u201dRong Yi also thought so, \u201cThey are opening tomorrow. Does it mean the competition of Nine Void Sect is officially over?\u201d\u201cYeah. Next their chief will allow all disciples to go out of the mountains to purchase some necessities, and all disciples of Haishan Academy could have a day off. It will be very lively in the streets today. Oh right, the little master\u2019s seniors will also come play with him.\u201dYin Tao said happily, \u201cDaddy, I invited my seniors to hang out with me.\u201dRong Yi asked, \u201cWhen are they coming?\u201d\u201cThey said they are going out with their parents in the morning, so they could only come in the afternoon and go back home after dinner.\u201d\u201cHmm, good. We\u2019re also going out in the morning and wouldn\u2019t come back until noon.\u201d\u201cYoung master, your dishes are ready.\u201d Rong Su and some servants laid the dishes on the table and then filled their bowls with some rice porridge.Later Su Gu also came, with a bunch of people Rong Yi had never seen before. They were all holding something in their hands covered with black cloth, so Rong Yi couldn\u2019t tell what it was.Rong Su then said with a smile, \u201cYoung master, this is what the lord has specially prepared for you. See if you like it.\u201d\u201cLook at you! All being so mysterious! What\u2019s underneath those black cloth?\u201d After taking a few sips of porridge to stuff his belly, Rong Yi walked before one of them, lifted a corner of the black cloth, noticing that something was wriggling, \u201cSomething alive?\u201dYin Tao was also curious what was in it, so he shouted, \u201cDaddy, pull it open!\u201dRong Yi pulled off the black cloth, and then a black worm came into sight in front of him.He was a bit surprised, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201dThe one who was holding the cage hurriedly introduced, \u201cYoung master, this is an Earthworm Locust that has promoted to Intelligence phase. It could spit out stones and also could burrow, and even understands human language.\u201dOnce he finished his words, the Earthworm Locust immediately spit out a pile of stones at Rong Yi. But since it was locked in the iron cage, plus the cage was set the formation suppressing it, the stones just bounced back on its own body, so it got upset and could only make circles inside it.\u201cYoung master, you like it?\u201d Rong Su asked, \u201cThe lord has specially asked me to get it for you.\u201dRong Yi looked over to Yin Jinye surprisingly, \u201cI was just saying it the other day, you really got it for me?\u201dTo be honest, it was impossible not to be touched if some of your random wishes were kept in mind by someone else!Yin Jinye responded with an \u201chmm\u201d.\u201cThank you,\u201d Rong Yi turned back and said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like this evil beast.\u201dOn thinking that such a worm wriggling inside his clothes, he already felt disgusted.Yin Tao also didn\u2019t like it, \u201cIt\u2019s ugly.\u201dOpn hearing someone said it was ugly, the Earthworm Locust immediately kept spitting out stones at Yin Tao angrily.Yin Tao giggled, \u201cYou can\u2019t reach me! You can\u2019t reach me!\u201dRong Su then asked the Earthworm Locust seller to back off, \u201cOur young master doesn\u2019t like it. You can go. Remember to go to the butler to get your spiritual stones.\u201dThat man immediately thank him. No one wouldn\u2019t feel happy getting free spiritual stones. \u201cNext.\u201dThe women behind the walked before Rong Yi, grinning, \u201cYoung master, please pull it off.\u201dNow Rong Yi knew it was all evil beasts behind the black cloth, so he just directly lifted it over, not so carefully as just now. This time it was a green snake in it.The snake seller then introduced, \u201cYoung master, this green snake has also promoted to Intelligence phase, and deadly poisonous. Those with low levels would immediately turn into corpse water if getting bitten by it. Those who were at the same level with it would also die in an hour. And those with higher levels or one phase higher would also feel feeble after getting bitten.\u201dThat green snake was even neither thicker nor longer than Rong Yi\u2019s finger, but the way it hissed was pretty vicious, like it was gonna bite you once it was released.Rong Yi shook his head, \u201cNah! I don\u2019t like snakes either.\u201dHe thought snakes were cold-blooded, and would easily hurt the boy.And over a dozen of evil beasts next also didn\u2019t interest Rong Yi, either too big or looking too disgusting.Now there were only three.\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d Then the next evil beast seller moved forward. Before he opened the cage, a big harsh sound was heard already.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRong Yi frowned and gave that man a look.The noise in the cage became louder and louder, like something was exploding. Yin Tao hurriedly covered his little ears and Su Gu quickly moved forward and carried him away.Then the cage shook violently, as if the beast in the cage was about to break out. The cage shook from side to side, and the man selling the beast was about to lose his grip on the cage.He instantly groveled and pressed it on the ground.Rong Su\u2019s voice sank, \u201cWhat is wrong with the evil beast?\u201dThe man then smiled awkwardly, saying with a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s an evil beast at Evil Elixir phase.\u201dEvil beasts belonged to beast cultivation. Like cultivators, they also had nine phases, Spirit Gathering, Intelligence, Bone Tempering, Beast Elixir, Shapeshifting, Soul Condensing, Immortal Approaching, Mahayana and Doom Overpowering. But their cultivation was more difficult than cultivators. They could reach the Intelligence phase after fifty years or even a hundred years to own human-like wisdom, but they were still quite weak and needed a few hundred years or even a thousand years to reach the Shapeshifting phase and turned into human shape. But those evil beasts owning the bloodline of grand evil beasts or divine beast could do shapeshifting during the Bone Tempering phase and their cultivation speed was much quicker than other evil beasts.\u201cEvil beast of Evil Elixir phase?\u201d Rong Su was on fire, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I want an evil beast below Bone Tempering phase? Why did you bring me this one? You are really unreliable!\u201dThe man explained in a hurry, \u201cWe got little evil beast of Intelligence phase, but before I brought it here, it happened to be promoting to Bone Tempering phase and failed to overpower its doom and died. So my boss asked me to bring an evil beast at Evil Elixir phase to try our luck. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll take it back. Guard Rong, please let the young master take a look. If he doesn\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll leave right away.\u201dIf it hadn\u2019t been that this evil beast was too small and hard to find a buyer, their shopkeeper wouldn\u2019t have asked him to bring it to have a try. If it was some evil beast of bigger size at the Evil Elixir phase, it might even be out of stock!Rong Su then turned to Rong Yi.Rong Yi said to the man, \u201cEvil beast of Evil Elixir level can talk, not bad. You put it on the stone stool and show me.\u201cOK!\u201d The man excitedly put the cage on the stone stool, then lifted the black cloth and pressed the cage from above in case it jumped up and down.The two colored shadows in the cage kept bumping into each other so fast that all the people around them could only see two shadows flying around.Rong Yi asked, \u201cIt seems there\u2019s more than one evil beast?\u201d\u201cYes, one is Wind Mosquito Beast, while the other is Bone Mantis Beast. Wind Mosquito Beast is like a common one from its appearance, but not so vulnerable. To some extent, it could resist most poisonous things and could drain its enemy\u2019s blood in an instant. The one gotten stung by it would grow carbuncles and discharge pus, the whole body would rot, and extremely itchy. And it could infect others with the disease or toxin it has brought from some other places. It flies as fast as the wind. So you know, it\u2019s really hard to catch one. And I can attack the enemy using its wings, deadly kind, you know.\u201dAfter hearing his introduction, Rong Yi suddenly got interested, \u201cI like this one.\u201dHaving seen so many evil beasts till now, this was the most satisfying one. On hearing that he said he liked it, the man\u2019s eyes were beaming and he thought there was a great chance he could sell both, so he immediately continued to introduce the other one, \u201cThe other one is called Bone Mantis Beast, as little as an ant. It can fly and fart. Its legs are pretty sharp and could debone someone in an instant. It could also spin and spit out corrosion liquid like a spider. The corrosion liquid could corrupt those magic weapons with lower level than it and make it useless. It can also release ice mist to freeze anything. Thought both were small, but very destructive, and very close to Shapeshifting phase. At that time, they would become even more powerful. They are really a bargain, and would definitely be useful to you, young master.\u201d\u201cShapeshifting phase\u2026\u201d Rong Su frowned. One should know an evil beast at Evil Elixir phase was almost on the same level with a cultivator at Golden Elixir phase or Nil Infant phase. So he really doubted whether Rong Yi who was only at level of Qi Practicing could control it.Rong Yi said, \u201cI want to see what they look like. If I can accept their looks, then I\u2019ll buy them.\u201d\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201d The man felt a little embarrassed, \u201cYoung master, I am only a cultivator at Qi Practicing. I can\u2019t let them stop fighting.\u201dRong Yi then turned back at Yin Jinye and wore a smile, \u201cDaddy, use your spiritual pressure to suppress them.\u201dYin Jinye gave him a look and then released his spiritual pressure over the cage. The next moment, the cage became quiet. The two little evil beasts were like being pressed by something over a thousand jin (one jin equals 0.5 kilogram), lying in the cage, legs shivering.The man then said while pointing at the one glittering with all colors, \u201cThis is the Wind Mosquito Beast, and that one with blue and white strips is Bone Mantis Beast.\u201d\u201cWow! They look beautiful!\u201d Yin Tao said excitedly.Rong Yi also liked them very much, \u201cI want them!\u201dRong Su then said, \u201cYoung master, they are both at Evil Elixir phase, you know.\u201dHe was afraid that the young master might not be able to control them and even get killed! At least he needed to own powerful enough spiritual pressure like the lord, or use powerful spiritual arts to bond with them, making them unable to resist.Rong Yi smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know how to make them behave.\u201dRong Su, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI also like them. Daddy, I want them, too!\u201d Yin Tao slipped off Su Gu\u2019s body and threw himself into Rong Yi\u2019s arms, \u201cDaddy, I want them too.\u201dRong Yi rubbed his little head, \u201cWhen you grow a little bigger, I\u2019m gonna buy you an evil beast. Rong Su, I want them. You can pay.\u201dThen the other two beast sellers said, \u201cYoung master, you haven\u2019t seen ours. Maybe you and the little master would both like them.\u201dRong Yi pulled off the black cloth. Both were Snake Bug Beast of Intelligence phase, not so adorable, \u201cI still want the Wind Mosquito Beast and the Bone Mantis Beast.\u201dRong Su then said to the Bone Mantis Beast seller, \u201cHow much are these two?\u201dThe man said, \u201cTwo thousand upper spiritual stones.\u201dDue to their small bodies, people would have no desire to buy them, otherwise they could be sold at least over ten thousand.Rong Su nodded, \u201cKeep the Wind Mosquito Beast and the Bone Mantis Beast, others can go to the butler to claim your reward.\u201dYin Jinye withdrew his Spiritual Pressure and asked Rong Yi, \u201cWhat are you gonna do with them next?\u201dRong Yi said to Rong Su, \u201cAsu, bring me Bu Qi and Xiang Lv.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWind Mosquito Beast tried to pick itself up and exclaimed, \u201cYou hypocritical human race! You claim to eliminate all evils and beasts while you enslave us to kill your enemies! I will never yield to you!\u201dBone Mantis Beast said approvingly, \u201cRight, we will never be enslaved to your human race who are weaker than us!\u201d\u201cWow! Wow! Wow! Daddy, they are talking!\u201d Yin Tao cried while staring at those two little evil beasts closely.Rong Yi said, \u201cWhen they advance to the Shapeshifting phase, they could even turn into human shape.\u201d\u201cWill they play with me then?\u201dThe Wind Mosquito Beast said grumpily, \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kill you!\u201dThe Bone Mantis Beast said, \u201cYou damn silly kid, are you taking us as toys?\u201d\u201cDaddy, they are so rude\u201d Yin Tao turned to Yin Jinye, \u201cFather, please use your Spiritual Pressure on them.\u201dThe Wind Mosquito Beast and Bone Mantis Beast, \u201c\u2026\u201dA kid who had his backing was really troublesome.Yin Jinye, \u201c\u2026\u201dDoes the kid take him as a beast tamer?Rong Yi also felt a little embarrassed. The kid was really a fast learner.He then put the cage on the table and sat down, saying to those two evil beasts, \u201cWhat are you names?\u201dThe Wind Mosquito Beast sulked, \u201cBah! You human race don\u2019t deserve to know our names.\u201dSeeing that every word of those evil beasts was full of disdain and contempt to Rong Yi, Su Gu really couldn\u2019t believe Rong Yi really had a way to control them.Rong Yi just ignored its words, and pinched its chin and said, \u201cSince you got no name, I can give you one.\u201dYin Jinye couldn\u2019t help giving him a glace. Would it be some kind of quirky names?\u201dRong Yi pointed at the Wind Mosquito Beast and said, \u201cYou are called Phoenix from now on. And the Bone Mantis Beast is called Dragon.\u201dOn hearing that, the two evil beasts were both angry and anxious, \u201cHow can give us Holy Beasts\u2019 names? No, definitely no! You can not show disrespect to them! Human race, you can\u2019t call us that!\u201dExcept that, those evil races who had inherited the blood of Phoenix and Dragon would also hunt them and their races down. Plus, they would also get laughed at by other evil races.Yin Tao giggled, \u201cPhoenix, Dragon! I like them!\u201dThe Wind Mosquito Beast said anxiously, \u201cYou silly kid, don\u2019t call me Phoenix! Call me Wind Inducing!\u201dThe Bone Mantis Beast immediately said, \u201cAnd don\u2019t call me Dragon. Call me Mantis Wave!\u201dRong Yi then said smilingly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? You know I even cracked my brain to think of those suitable names for you two.\u201dWind Inducing and Mantis Wave, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Gu couldn\u2019t help smiling. It seems the young master really knew how to deal with them.\u201cMaster shifu, are you looking for us?\u201d Bu Qi and Xiang Lv directly jumped in over the wall.Rong Yi asked Bu Qi, \u201cHow is your rune burning practice?\u201dBu Qi answered, \u201cThree out of ten failed. I still need more practice.\u201d\u201cAlready good enough.\u201d Rong Yi then asked Xiang Lv, \u201cCan you refine magic weapons and equipment for evil beasts at Evil Elixir phase?\u201dXiang Lv found that his talent could finally come in handy, he instantly answered excitedly, eyes beaming, \u201cOf course, that\u2019s what I am good at. What evil beasts would like me to refine those things for??Rong Yi then pointed at the two little evil beasts in the cage.Xiang Lv frowned, \u201cSo little?\u201dWind Inducing and Mantis Wave, \u201c\u2026\u201dHuman race would refine magic weapons and equipment for them???\u201cCan you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRong Yi looked at Wind Inducing and Mantis Wave again and again, \u201cThese two little things are too fragile. You need to refine them with the hardest ingredients of level one, two, three and four.\u201dTo him, evil beasts of Evil Elixir phase were still too weak. So they needed magic weapons and equipment to improve their abilities and cover their shortages.Xiang Lv knew it was not any formula he had used before, so he immediately took out a brush and a piece of paper to write it down.Mantis Wave ridiculed, \u201cYou human race is so stingy to use level 1 ingredients to refine magic weapons for us! They can\u2019t even compare with those we are wearing now.\u201dWind Inducing said, \u201cI will never wear anything human race has refined for me!\u201dRong Yi cast a glance at them, and then told Xiang Lv a series of ingredients\u2019 names. After observing them for some time, he then drew some paintings and gave them to Xiang Lv.Xiang Lv took the paintings excitedly, \u201cI\u2019ll do it now!\u201dRong Yi then said, \u201cI\u2019ll take the ingredient fees as your tuition.\u201dXiang Lv hurriedly thanked him, \u201cThank you, master shifu.\u201dAll ingredients together, it was 100 upper spiritual stones at most. An absolute bargain compared with a divine spiritual stone for a formula of master shifu!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
