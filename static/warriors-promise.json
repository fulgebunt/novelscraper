Both Rank 2 and Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul were common Martial Souls and were considered mediocre.Many people in the martial practice field fixed their eyes on two young men who were standing in the front row.One was dressed in teal clothes, and the other one was wearing purple clothes. They were both quite handsome.The young man in teal was called Su Mo, the young master of the Sus and the son of the Master of the Sus.The young man in purple was the son of the First Elder of the Sus.They both were seeded disciples with great talents among all inferiors, especially Su Mo.The young master had accomplished Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm at the age of 15, and he was endowed with the highest talent among all inferiors.Therefore, everyone looked forward to seeing what levels of Martial Souls they would awaken.In the first row, Su Yu, dressed in purple clothes, glanced at Su Mo, who was next to him. He sneered and said, \"You're called the top genius of the entire Su clan. I hope that you can awaken a Martial Soul that is well worthy of your identity.\"The eyes of Su Yu were full of sarcasm. He had an extremely high talent, but Su Mo was spoken more highly of than him in the Su clan.The so-called nickname of top genius made Su Mo so famous that he stole Su Yu's honors.As a result, Su Yu could only be second to him every time.Su Yu was so furious, because even the lady he liked had a crush on Su Mo.Now, his opportunity had finally arrived. As long as he could awaken a Martial Soul with a higher level than that of Su Mo, he would claim the title of first genius among the Sus.However, Su Mo was unprovoked. He did not say anything, because he clearly knew Su Yu's hostility toward him.Then, the hosting elder exclaimed,\"Next up, Su Mo!\"Su Mo instantly strode onto the altar.Right at this moment, all people fixed their eyes on him and the entire martial practice field immediately quietened. They were wondering what the level of Martial Soul Su Mo, the first genius of the Su clan, could awaken.After entering the altar, Su Mo sat cross-legged with his eyes tightly closed.Glowing runes emerged consecutively beneath the altar and entered into Su Mo's body.The surrounding disciples of the Sus started to whisper after Su Mo entered the altar.\"Can you guess which level of Martial Soul brother Su Mo can awaken?\"\"As the young master, the level of his Martial Soul must be very high.\"\"You're right. He has accomplished Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm at less than 15 years old, so he'll awaken a Martial Soul with an extremely high level.\"Amidst the disciples' heated discussion, more and more sparkling runes floated above the altar and enveloped Su Mo's body.With his legs crossed and eyes closed, Su Mo started to breathe quickly, and roaring sounds gradually arose.Everyone stopped breathing and stared closely at the altar.Boom!Finally, with a mighty booming sound, a dark shadow abruptly rose from his body.This dark shadow was a huge vortex, inside which was a bottomless black hole, making people feel a chill.At the same time, a yellow halo appeared above the shadow.Ah!All the Sus were instantly glassy-eyed.\"Why is there only one halo?\"\"His Martial Soul is Rank 1 Human Class?\"\"How is this possible?\"Everyone was stunned, and even Su Yu felt startled with his mouth agape.He had not expected that Su Mo would only awaken a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.The Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul was the lowest one and totally useless.Seated on the altar with his legs crossed, Su Mo slowly opened his eyes. He was also dumbfounded when he saw his Martial Soul.\"Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul...\" Su Mo murmured with a bitter smile on his lips. He had never thought that he would awaken a lowest rank Martial Soul.After a while, everyone regained consciousness, and the martial practice field was suddenly in an uproar.\"Oh my, my eyes must be playing tricks on me. It's a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, the totally useless one?\"\"He awakened a useless Martial Soul. Crap, I can't believe I anticipated for so long!\"\"He isn't a genius, but the most useless person in our clan!\"\"...\"All the spectators were talking about the matter, and all the elders and inferiors of the Sus changed their view of Su Mo.They used to look at him with respect and admiration, but now, they were looking at him with disappointment and contempt.On the altar, Su Mo managed to slowly stand up with his fists clenched.He looked around and saw their expressions. \"What snobbish people they are!\" Su Mo smiled satirically in his heart.Previously, when he was considered to be highly talented, all of them showed their respect to him. Wherever he went, they all swarmed to him and kissed his ass.Now, after he awakened a useless Martial Soul, they all instantly looked at him with contempt.After a while, Su Mo took a deep breath and strode off the altar.\"Next one, Su Yu!\" exclaimed the hosting elder.Glancing at Su Mo, he shook his head secretly. The former genius was a genius no more!Upon hearing this, Su Yu walked toward the altar with a prideful look.When he passed by Su Mo, he coldly laughed and disdainfully said, \"I used to regard you as my rival. But from now on, the rivalry is gone, and I'll tread you under my foot forever!\"Su Yu felt extremely happy. Now that Su Mo had awakened the lowest rank Martial Soul, Su Mo would not even be eligible to lick his shoes.Even if he awakened a bad Martial Soul, it would still be higher than Su Mo's.Su Yu strode onto the altar after saying these words.Without responding to his provocation, Su Mo returned to the martial practice field and calmly observed the ceremony.Standing in the martial practice field, he felt some disparaging eyes fixed upon him and saw the disdainful expressions of disciples around him.Su Mo's heart could not stop twitching. After all, the feeling of falling from heaven to hell was indeed torture.Now, Su Yu sat on the altar cross-legged. The glowing runes emerged from the black alter and all entered his body.The martial practice field quieted down again, and everyone looked forward to seeing his Martial Soul.Su Mo had awakened a useless Martial Soul, so it was impossible that Su Yu would awaken another useless one.Otherwise, the Sus would become a joke in Sunnywood City.Howl!As everyone was anticipating, a beast's roar abruptly came out from Su Yu's body.A giant virtual shadow of a snake rose above the head of him, triumphantly.There were five dazzling yellow halos around the python's shadow.The hosting elder was stunned at the sight of his Martial Soul. Then, he shouted excitedly, \"Five halos! It's a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul \u2014Iron-scaled Python.\"The Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul was the highest one in all of Sunnywood City. Finally, another genius had appeared in the Sus.The entire martial practice field fell into silence at the sight of Su Yu's Martial Soul.Then, it was in an uproar again.\"Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul!\"\"Haha! The top genius appeared in the Su clan.\"\"Brother Su Yu turned out to be the first genius of our Su clan. Su Mo is nothing!\"\"You're right! Su Mo only has a useless Martial Soul. He can't be compared with Su Yu!\"All disciples of the Sus looked at Su Yu with admiration.On the altar, Su Yu saw that he awakened a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and heard the surprise and admiration from the crowd.A thick of pride arose in his heart and felt that everything was beautiful. He was full of high spirits and thought that no one could rival him.He arrogantly turned to Su Mo and looked at him with eyes full of sarcasm, as if to say, \"I will always tread you under my foot from now on.\"After seeing Su Yu's proud look and hearing the praise from the crowd, Su Mo sighed in his heart and left the martial practice field.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To be exact, he was a king of mercenaries, a legendary hero in the field.As an orphan, he had lived with his relatives since he was a child. At the age of 17, he decided to drop out of school and join the army.After two years' training, Su Mo was recruited into the strongest special forces in China for his excellent martial skills and soon became the top member of the special forces.Within four years, Su Mo had successfully executed nearly 100 national military missions.Su Mo had thought that he would devote his entire life to his motherland, to the army. But unfortunately, he had got discharged from the army for an accident and left the army dismally.After returning home, he could not fit into normal society or find a job because he had no diploma, skills, or network.Half sitting around for six months, Su Mo decided to embark on a new journey.He enlisted several past comrades in arms and formed Dragon Soul, a small mercenary organization.In the ensuing years, Su Mo and the Dragon Soul Mercenary Group travelled all over the world.They were on the spot in all wars, including ones in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia.The Dragon Soul Mercenary Group developed rapidly from its initial size of a few people into dozens, hundreds, and finally, thousands of people.It went from an unknown small organization into a powerful mercenary army that ruled over a dark world.Dragon Soul Mercenary had never failed its missions. For the right price, the organization could accomplish any mission, like destroying the army of a small country or overthrowing governments.Last year, Dragon Soul Mercenary even defeated Blackblood Mercenary, which used to be the top mercenary organization in the world, thus becoming the new ruler of the mercenary field.As the leader of Dragon Soul Mercenary, Su Mo was regarded as king of all mercenaries.One could say that his name remained a taboo in the dark world. When he stomped his foot, the entire dark world would shake.However, no one could keep his shoes dry if he always walked along the riverside. In the end, he was completely betrayed!He was sold out by his most trusted brothers and died with his enemies in a trap.After being in this world for 14 years, he was fully adapted and had almost completely forgotten his previous life.He was greatly curious about this world, which was a very magical place that was completely different from Earth.This continent was called Firmament and Continent and had a vast and unmeasurable landscape.This world highly revered martial arts and believed in survival of the fittest. The strong were worshipped like kings, while the weak were crushed like ants.If a person could achieve grand completion in cultivation, he would possess the most powerful skills and could travel to anywhere he wanted in the universe.A powerful martial artist could access unlimited power, status, money and women.In order to become a powerful martial artist, one needed to awaken his Martial Soul, absorb Spiritual Qi from the heaven and earth, fortify his body, and refine his genuine Qi.There were countless types of Martial Souls with varying levels of strength.They were divided into three classes, namely heaven, earth and human class, each of which was classified into nine ranks.The higher a martial artist's level of Martial Soul, the stronger his power and potential were, and the faster his ability to cultivate was.After coming to this world, Su Mo had worked very hard to cultivate.He did this because he wanted to explore this big and exciting world.In his previous life, he had been a powerful man and ruled the whole world.In this present life, he still wanted to be a strong man who could overlook others.However, today's Martial Soul awakening ceremony was a humbling slap to the face.His dream was wonderful, but the reality was much too cruel.Suddenly, a deep voice sounded at the door and brought him back to his senses.\"Mo'er.\"The voice belonged to a tall and solemn middle-aged man. He was Su Hong, the Master of the Sus.Upon seeing Su Mo, Su Hong tried to comfort him, saying, \"Stop thinking about your Martial Soul. You may have a weaker one, but if you try your hardest to cultivate, you'll still become powerful one day.\"Su Mo gave him a bitter smile, thinking, \"My Martial Soul isn't just weaker. It's the weakest one.\"\"Don't worry, Father. I'll work harder!\" he said, forcing a smile.He knew that his father was comforting him.Everyone knew that the level of one's Martial Soul decided his future accomplishments. The stronger the Martial Soul one awakened, the further one would go in martial arts.This was an indisputable law.It was impossible for him to become powerful with his Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.\"Good.\" Su Hong nodded.He took out a jade jar and handed it to Su Mo, saying, \"This is a Qi Condensation Elixir that'll help you break through your cultivation and enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.\"\"Father...\"Su Mo felt his heart ache. After he awakened a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, he would be considered as a total failure to cultivate.Qi Condensation Elixir was so priceless that the Sus could not have bought it for him, so Su Hong must have bought it with his own money.Su Mo accepted this elixir, and the two chatted for a while before Su Hong left.\"What type of Martial Soul have I awakened?\"Su Mo was not in a haste to take the elixir after his father left. Instead, he sat cross-legged in his room and released his Martial Soul.A dark vortex surrounded by a shining yellow halo suspended quietly above him.\"What special skills does it have? I'd better cultivate it for a while.\"Su Mo calmed his heart, used his mind to connect with the Martial Soul, and sensed the Spiritual Qi from heaven and earthThe black vortex began to slowly rotate, and the center of the vortex emitted a strong suction force.Wisps of Spiritual Qi converged toward Su Mo and entered his body.He was soon immersed in cultivating and drove his Martial Soul to continuously absorb the Spiritual Qi.After a long time, Su Mo stopped.He opened his eyes with a hint of surprise.\"My Martial Soul is Rank 1 Human Class, but its cultivating pace equals the speed of Rank 2 Human Class.\"Su Mo had met many martial artists whose Martial Souls were of the Rank 2 Human Class, and his Martial Soul was no worse than theirs.This unexpected surprise greatly alleviated his depression.After some pondering, Su Mo realized that this speed was probably related to the property of his Martial Soul.His Martial Soul was a vortex which naturally had the property of suction.Therefore, it was normal for his Martial Soul to absorb Spiritual Qi at a speed that equaled that of Rank 2 Human Class Martial Soul.He took out the Qi Condensation Elixir his father had given to him and prepared to enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.At the beginning of the martial arts journey, one must complete Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm. Then, one could awaken the Martial Soul to absorb Spiritual Qi, refine genuine Qi, and enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.Only after entering the Qi Cultivation Realm would one be considered a true martial artist.As soon as he swallowed the Qi Condensation Elixir, its effects immediately surged throughout his body.Su Mo hurriedly ushered its powers into his elixir field and started to refine genuine Qi.Time slowly passed. After four hours, Su Mo abruptly opened his eyes, and a sliver of light flashed in his eyes.At this moment, a mass of vaporous genuine Qi had gathered in his elixir field.The Qi Condensation Elixir was proven to be worthy and had helped him enter Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he had awakened his Martial Soul, and his cultivation was at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm, he could choose cultivation skill and martial skill suited for him.There were nine levels of cultivation skill and martial skill.Each level was divided into three grades: Lower, Medium, and Upper.Martial artists who used higher grade cultivation skill were naturally more powerful.\"Elder, I want to choose a scroll on the second floor,\" Su Mo said, saluting the pavilion protector as he stepped into the Book Collection Pavilion.\"The second floor?\"The pavilion protector, a fat old man, said indifferently, \"Su Mo, the second floor can only be accessed by those whose cultivation is at the Qi Cultivation Realm. No exceptions.\"\"I know that, elder. My cultivation is at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm,\" Su Mo nodded and said.\"Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm?\" The pavilion protector was stunned. Then, he said with a cold expression, \"Su Mo, you just awakened your Martial Soul yesterday, and it was at Rank 1 Human Class. How could you be at the Qi Cultivation Realm so soon with that crappy Martial Soul? Even if you had a Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul, it wouldn't be possible. Are you kidding me?\"\"Humph! You'll see!\"Su Mo released an aura of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm with a serious expression.Then, he turned around and went up to the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion, leaving the pavilion protector behind.\"He... he did it!\"The pavilion protector was stunned, but then he laughed disdainfully and said to himself, \"The Master must have given him some precious elixir, but he still won't be able to go much further with his crappy Martial Soul.\"Su Mo went to the second floor and saw rows of antique bookshelves, which were full of scrolls.The Sus was one of two main clans in Sunnywood City, so they had many cultivation skills and martial skills. There were almost 100 scrolls on the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion.A tall young man was browsing the scrolls there.\"Su Mo!\"The young man was initially surprised to see Su Mo, but then he glared at him with complete disdain.\"Su Heng!\" Su Mo glanced back at him.Su Heng also awakened a Martial Soul yesterday. His Martial Soul was of Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul, which was not as good as Su Yu's, but a high rank nonetheless.Since Su Heng was on the second floor, his cultivation must have also reached the Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Well, this is unexpected, Su Mo. I heard yesterday that the Master bought a 'Qi Condensation Elixir' from the Herbs Shop, which is probably what you used to increase your cultivation!\"Su Heng looked at Sumo and said disdainfully, \"Otherwise, you wouldn't even be able to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with that crappy Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.\"\"It's none of your business how I got this cultivation,\" Su Mo said coldly. Then, he began to browse the manuals and ignored him.Su Mo knew Su Heng very well.When Su Mo was still considered the top genius of the Sus, Su Heng had fawned on him, and Su Mo had been very kind to him.However, Su Heng now had a completely different attitude towards Su Mo.\"Humph! So much for being a genius. You're nothing but a piece of trash!\" Su Heng snorted and continued selecting his manuals.Su Mo picked up a manual in the cultivation skill category and began reading it.\"Raging Fire Skill. Medium Lv 1 Cultivation Skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method has extremely powerful fire power and has a very strong attack...\"Su Mo continued to browse after reading a few pages of this book.He wanted to read a few more manuals to choose the most suitable cultivation skill.All of the manuals on this floor were at Medium Lv 1. The manuals of Upper Lv 1 were only on the third floor.However, those manuals were only available for those whose cultivation was at Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Huge Rock Skill. Medium Lv 1 cultivation skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method is dense and has strong defense...\"\"Clouds Skill. Medium Lv 1 cultivation skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method is pure and has equally strong attack and defense...\"After reading several manuals, Su Mo selected Cloud Skill because of its pure genuine Qi and strong attack and defense.After choosing a cultivation skill, it was time to choose a martial skill.\"Iron Fist. This fistplay is fierce and can easily crack open stones after practicing to the great Completion Realm... \"\"Flying Swordplay. This swordsmanship is ethereal, agile, and gorgeous...\"\"Breeze Palm...\"\"Infinite Push Hands...\"Su Mo was not satisfied with a dozen martial skills that he read.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist?\"Su Mo's eyes brightened when he saw the name of this manual. He could recognize that it was extraordinary.He opened the manual excitedly. \"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist. Medium Lv 1 Martial Skill. The body is like the sea, and the fist is like a wave. The fist force has many levels, and each level is stronger than the previous one.\"\"This is the one!\" After reading for a moment, Su Mo nodded with satisfaction.As he was about to leave with the two manuals, Su Heng suddenly blocked him.\"Su Mo, put down Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist,\" Su Heng shouted arrogantly.Su Mo glanced at him and asked, \"Why should I?\"\"I was thinking about taking that manual, and I've decided that I want it, so give it back to me!\" Su Heng raised his chin and ordered.\"Give it back to you? It was never yours!\"Su Mo scoffed and said, \"The book is mine now, so you're not getting it.\"\"Are you sure?\" Su Heng's eyes grew cold, and he said, \"Su Mo, do you know what the consequences of angering me are?\"\"What consequences?\" Su Mo smiled and said, \"I have no idea. Please tell me.\"\"You're a piece of trash, but you're still so arrogant.\" Su Heng shouted furiously, \"Su Mo, I'll say it again. Give it to me, kneel, and apologize, or I'll break your legs.\"\"Kneel and apologize, or you'll break my legs?\"A cold light flashed in Su Mo's eyes, and he said indifferently, \"I'd like to see you try!\"\"You're courting death!\"Su Heng shouted, and his spirit of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm exploded. A yellow light shone behind him, which meant that he was arousing his Martial Soul to attack.\"Stop it!\"At that moment, the pavilion protector said with an icy voice, \"No fighting in the Book Collection Pavilion, or you'll be banned for life!\"These words stopped Su Heng.\"Elder, I'm sorry. I won't violate the rules,\" Su Heng said hastily to the elder, stifling his anger.Even though he wanted to teach Su Mo a lesson, Su Heng did not dare to violate the rules.It would be a great loss if he was banned from the Book Collection Pavilion for life.\"Today is your lucky day. I won't let you off next time,\" Su Heng turned to Su Mo and snarled.\"Idiot!\" Su Mo glanced at him and turned to leave.\"What did you say?\"Su Heng became furious again. He glared at the leaving Su Mo and gnashed his teeth in anger.Since he had awakened a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul, his status had risen a lot in the Sus, and others were polite to him.Today, he was insulted by this useless man with a crappy Martial Soul, and that drove him mad.\"Damn it, I'll make you pay!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His cultivation was slowly increasing.While Su Mo was cultivating, the news that he awakened a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul spread all throughout Sunnywood City.The young master and the first genius of the Sus unexpectedly had a crappy Martial Soul!This caused a stir in Sunnywood City, and many people treated him like a joke....Five days later, Su Mo stopped cultivating.\"The level of my Martial Soul is so low that it's slowing down my cultivating!\" Su Mo sighed.After five days of hard work, his cultivation had only increased marginally.At this rate, it would take at least six months to enter Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm .Luckily, he had cultivated Clouds Skill to the second level and purified and condensed a good amount of genuine Qi in five days.\"Time to cultivate my martial skill!\"Su Mo took out Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist and carefully read it.After he fully understood all of the details, he closed the scroll and walked into the yard.\"The purpose of Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist is to regard the body as a raging sea and the fists as waves, each one stronger than the one before...\"With the key to this fistplay in mind, he practiced every gesture and motion according to the manual.\"Ho! Ho! Ho!\"He punched very slowly at first, but gradually moved faster and faster. In the end, his fists exploded like bombs and stirred up endless gusts of wind.Another five days passed by.The wind from his fist power was screaming, and the air was endlessly stirred.\"Ho!\" Su Mo lifted up a shout and landed a punch on the stone bench ahead.Bang!The stone bench exploded with a rumbling sound, and its fragments flew everywhere.\"Hu!\"Su Mo took a deep breath and stood with his fists clenched.\"Not bad! I've achieved Minor Completion!\" Su Mo could not stop smiling.He was now able to punch with a fivefold fist force, but after reaching Completion Realm, his fist force would be ninefold.Almost no one in Sunnywood City could reach the Minor Completion Realm of a Medium Lv 1 Martial Skill in only five days. Su Mo was able to do so because living two lives had given him very strong comprehension.\"Now, it's time to enter Breezewind Mountain to try my luck.\"Su Mo whispered. Then, he packed up and set out.Breezewind Mountain lay in a mountain range that covered about 49,000 square kilometers,\u00a0and it was 15 kilometers away from Sunnywood City. It was lofty and densely covered in forests.Since there were a lot of Spiritual Herbs there, many martial artists in Sunnywood City always went into the mountains to collect them.However, opportunity always came with danger. Lots of martial artists were killed and eaten by the large number of demonic beasts that lived in the mountains.In spite of the dangers, Su Mo had to take a chance. It was too hard for him to cultivate with his low-grade Martial Soul.Su Mo was walking down a tree-lined path when he suddenly heard a burst of a giggles.He turned around and was stunned by what he saw.A boy and a girl were cuddling happily with each other under a pavilion beside a pond.The girl was a true beauty. Tall and slim, she wore a purple dress over her fair skin, and her loose black hair was draped over her shoulders.She was Liu Yushan, Su Mo's childhood sweetheart and cousin.Liu Yushan was the eldest daughter of the Liu clan, which was a small clan in Sunnywood City that depended upon the Sus.Su Mo and Liu Yushan grew up together, so they were very close.Their parents had wanted them to get engaged at the beginning of next year.The young man with Liu Yushan was no other than Su Yu, the martial artist who replaced Su Mo as first genius of the Sus....Su Mo made eye contact with them.\"Yushan, why are you two together?\" Su Mo asked with a frown, walking toward them.Liu Yushan turned her head away with an inexplicable glint in her eyes and said nothing.Su Yu glanced at Su Mo and coldly smiled. \"Su Mo, from now on, Yushan is mine. Leave her alone, or you will have to answer to me.\"\"Yushan!\" Su Mo ignored Su Yu and stared at Liu Yushan.\"Su Mo, did you hear what I said?\" Su Yu's eyes were cold, and he said, \"A piece of trash like you doesn't deserve her. Only I, a genius, am the best fit for Yushan.\"Liu Yushan nodded and said, \"He's right.\"\"Why? Because of my Martial Soul?\"Although Su Mo was upset, he did not let himself get enraged and remained calm. He was a mercenary king during his past life and had gotten his fair share of women. If a girl did not like him, it did not bother him.\"Cousin, we don't belong to the same kind of people anymore,\" Liu Yushan nodded and said.\"Don't belong to the same type of people anymore?\" Su Mo muttered and smiled bitterly, thinking,\"Three days ago, I awakened a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul. We will only grow further apart as time goes on.\" Liu Yushan said pridefully, \"Su Yu, the genius of the Sus, is my ideal spouse. As for you, my cousin, you're a good-for-nothing. The difference between you and him is extremely apparent.\"\"Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul?\"Su Mo was not surprised by her Martial Soul, because Liu Yushan was very talented.\"I see!\" Su Mo nodded and said calmly. Everyone was entitled to a choice. Since she had chosen to abandon him, he would not try to change her mind.Liu Yushan frowned at Su Mo's placid face.She had thought that he would be devastated and would beg desperately for her,So his cool demeanor bothered her.\"Yushan, remember what you said today. I hope that you won't regret it in the future!\"Su Mo took a deep breath as he said those words and left.\"Regret? How is that possible?\" Liu Yushan laughed and shook her head....After leaving the Sus, Su Mo sprinted straight toward Breezewind Mountain.An hour later, he arrived at the foot of Breezewind Mountain.Breezewind Mountain looked like a huge monster creeping on the ground, giving off a cold and ruthless aura.Without hesitation, Su Mo sprang into the mountains.Before long, Su Mo had run five kilometers into the forest, where the trees towered over him with thick trunks and completely blocked out all the sunlight.\"Howl!\"Then, a giant black wolf sprang out into Su Mo's path.\"Evilwind Wolf, Class 1 Lv 1 Demonic Beast!\"Su Mo recognized it. A demonic beast at this level was as powerful as martial artists at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Well, I'll practice with you!\"Su Mo flew forward like a flying arrow and hit the Evilwind Wolf with his fist, which was covered with strong genuine Qi.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist!\"\"Howl!\"The Evilwind Wolf was enraged by Su Mo's attack, roared, and pounced on him. Its sharp wolf claws split toward his head.Bang!The claws and fist clashed with a muffled sound.Boom! Boom! Boom!Su Mo was stumbled back three steps, but the Evilwind Wolf was blown 10 meters away.The Evilwind Wolf was quite powerful, but its rough force was no match for Su Mo's martial arts.\"Haha! Let's go again.\"As Su Mo moved forward and continually punched, the Evilwind Wolf retreated one step after another.Soon, the flesh of the wolf was split into shreds, and several of its bones were broken.The Evilwind Wolf would have been dead if it were not so tough.\"Howl!\"The seriously injured Evilwind Wolf roared and slunk away instead of attacking again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The plant had eight green leaves surrounding a pale red fruit, which was only the size of a thumb but exuded a fruity fragrance.\"Is that... Purple Spirit Fruit?\"Su Mo stared at it and became excited.Purple Spirit Fruit was a Medium Lv 1 Spirit Fruit, which could increase by one level the cultivation of martial artists who were below Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm.However, judging by its color, the fruit was not yet fully ripe.Nevertheless, eating this fruit would still increase Su Mo's cultivation to Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm.The Evilwind Wolf must have selected the cave as its den for the sake of eating Purple Spirit Fruit.\"Howl!\"Seeing Su Mo enter the cave, the injured Evilwind Wolf roared and bit toward the Purple Spirit Fruit.\"Damn it...\"Su Mo was rattled. If the Evilwind Wolf swallowed the Purple Spirit Fruit, all hope would be lost.\"Die!\"Su Mo roared and stepped suddenly. Genuine Qi spewed out from under his feet, propelling him over the Evilwind Wolf.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist!\"After motivating his genuine Qi to the extreme, Su Mo heavily struck the head of the Evilwind Wolf with his fivefold fist force.Bang!With blood splashing and brains spraying, the Evilwind Wolf was blasted to pieces.After killing the Evilwind Wolf, Su Mo was finally relieved.Walking to the side of the corpse, Su Mo pulled a gray crystal, its Demonic Core, from the Evilwind Wolf's skull.The Demonic Core of a Class 1 Lv 1 Demonic Beast was at least worth 10 taels of silver.Then, Su Mo plucked the Purple Spirit Fruit without hesitation.Although the Purple Spirit Fruit was not ripe, Su Mo could not afford to wait. After all, a Medium Grade Purple Spirit Fruit was quite rare.He sat down cross-legged and swallowed it.The cave was secluded, so it was not dangerous to refine the fruit there.As soon as the Purple Spirit Fruit was swallowed, its strong medicinal effects spread throughout Su Mo's body.Su Mo hastily held his breath and concentrated so he could transfer the effects flowing in his meridians into genuine Qi and guide them into his elixir field.After a while, Su Mo's elixir field bulged with abundant Qi.\"I've finally broken into the Late Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"Su Mo exclaimed and nodded with satisfaction.The Purple Spirit Fruit not only helped him reach Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm but also promoted him to the Late Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm.Now, Su Mo's genuine Qi was twice as dense as it was before.He could obviously feel that his senses were more acute than before.\"I should stabilize my cultivation before leaving.\"Su Mo smiled and began cultivating again.A black vortex Martial Soul rose from behind him and rotated slowly.Then, something strange happened.The dead Evilwind Wolf's Blood Qi and energy were all sucked in by the vortex Martial Soul.Moreover, an illusory Beast Soul floated up slowly from the corpse and was devoured by the vortex Martial Soul.All of the Evilwind Wolf's Blood Qi was transformed into a strong energy after entering Su Mo's body.Su Mo felt his Qi increase greatly and approach the peak of Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"What is this...?\"Su Mo trembled in shock.\"Can a Martial Soul devour Blood Qi?\"\"Can a Martial Soul devour Beast Souls?\"Su Mo had never heard of or seen such a Martial Soul.In the midst of his marveling, something strange happened.The vortex Martial Soul that had devoured the Beast Soul began vibrating and then exploded with yellow light.Instead of having its previous yellow halo, it was now shining with two yellow halos.The vortex Martial Soul now was twice as fast at abosrbing Spiritual Qi as before.\"What?\"Although Su Mo was usually a composed person, he was filled with excitement at that moment.Everyone knew that the rank of one's Martial Soul was determined at birth and unchangeable after awakening. This was an eternally immutable truth.The cultivating talent of a martial artist was mainly determined by the level of their Martial Soul.Su Mo's Martial Soul had just broken the logic of this world.His Martial Soul had progressed from Rank 1 Human Class to Rank 2 Human Class.If he could devour enough Beast Souls, his Martial Soul level could even increase to Earth Class and Heaven Class.\"The Heaven Class! How exciting it would be!\" Su Mo felt very excited.\"Haha, Haha!\"After a while, Su Mo calmed down but could\u00a0not help laughing.\"Is this my luck as a time traveler?\" he thought.Since his awakening, Su Mo had felt depressed by the level of his Martial Soul.He did not know about his Martial Soul's special ability before.However, this supernatural ability exceeded all of his expectations.Su Mo's excitement dispelled all of his depression.\"I'll call you Devouring Martial Spirit from now on!\" Su Mo said with a laugh.After that, Su Mo quickly left the cave and could not wait to kill demonic beasts and devour Beast Souls.Over the next two days, Su Mo crazily slaughtered more than 50 demonic beasts.Among these beasts, 10 demonic beasts were Class 2 Lv 1, and the others were Class 1 Lv 1.Having devoured the essence, blood and Beast Souls of all the demonic beasts, not only had Su Mo's cultivation broken through to Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, but also his Martial Soul had progressed to Rank 3 Human Class.His fistplay had also greatly improved by killing those demonic beasts.His Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist now had sixfold fist force, and its attack had greatly increased.Su Mo sat cross-legged in the cave. The black Devouring Martial Spirit floated behind him with three dazzling yellow halos.The surrounding Spiritual Qi was being absorbed into Su Mo's body in torrents.After his Martial Soul progressed to Rank 3 Human Class, it was ten times faster at absorbing Spiritual Qi than at Rank 1.After a while, Su Mo opened his eyes.\"With my cultivation fully stabilized at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, I can kill stronger demonic beasts!\"Su Mo grinned exuberantly.After the progression of his cultivation and Martial Soul, Su Mo had returned to the cave again. After all, his sharp increase in cultivation over the past two days needed to be well consolidated.Pitter-patter, pitter-patter...Footsteps suddenly sounded from outside the cave.\"Brother Wei Long, the Purple Spirit Fruit is in this cave, and it is probably almost ripe.\"\"Be careful, I think there's an Evilwind Wolf guarding it.\"\"Hah! A mere Evilwind Wolf? I can kill it with a turn of my hand.\"Hearing the voices, Su Mo saw two tall young men stride into the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you steal our Purple Spirit Fruit?\" Wei Long, the handsome one, barked at Su Mo.\"Your Purple Spirit Fruit?\"\"Spiritual Herbs grow naturally in the mountains, so they're fair game. Why is it yours?\" Su Mo sneered.\"Go to hell! How dare you steal our Spiritual Fruit!\" shouted Wei Shan, the long-faced youth.\"We found the Purple Spirit Fruit 10 days ago and were just waiting for it to ripen! How dare you take it from us!\"\"Why do you look so familiar?\"Wei Long suddenly said with a glint in his eye, \"I remember. You are Su Mo, a piece of trash with a Martial Soul of the Rank 1 Human Class.\"\"Oh, it's you!\" Wei Shan said scornfully.\"Are you two from the Weis?\"Su Mo saw on their clothes the symbol of the Weis, one of the two main clans in Sunnywood City.The Weis and the Sus were equally matched as the two most powerful families in Sunnywood City, and they constantly contested and clashed.\"Exactly! Come on, give me the fruit!\" Wei Shan arrogantly yelled.\"Forget it. I have already swallowed it,\" said Su Mo indifferently.\"What?\" Both men were instantly enraged.Since they had waited for the Purple Spirit Fruit for over half a month, how could they not be angry that they got nothing in the end?\"Damn it! How dare you eat my fruit? Kneel to me and destroy your cultivation, or die!\" Wei Long yelled in a rage.\"Kneel? Destroy my own cultivation?\"Su Mo was speechless. \"Are they playing God? Maybe I was so nice after coming to this world that they think I can be easily bullied?\"\"Crap! Brother Wei Long, let me kill this piece of trash.\"With an angry shout, Wei Shan punched toward Su Mo's face, thinking that one punch would be enough to defeat him.\"Die for your arrogance!\" Su Mo coldly said, and he slightly lifted up his palm and punched back.Wei Shan sneered, \"Do you want to play rough? How stupid! Go to hell!\"However, his smile froze in the very next second.As they collided, Wei Shan felt a horrible power from Su Mo's fist, like that of a monstrous wave.\"Ah!\"With a scream, Wei Shan was blasted against the wall of the cave and passed out.\"What? How can it be?\"Wei Long was shocked. He looked at Su Mo and said, \"The Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm? Damn it! Aren't you just a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul?\"\"A piece of trash?\"With a cold laugh, Su Mo blocked their exit and strode toward Wei Long, saying, \"How dare you to call me a piece of trash? Dumb-ass!\"Seeing Su Mo moving toward him, Wei Long frowned and yelled, \"What do you want?\"\"To kill you!\" Su Mo laughed coldly.\"Kill me? How dare you! My father is one of the elders in the Weis. If you kill me, he will find you and kill you, wherever you go.\"Wei Long was quite confident and fearless.\"Idiot! No one will know that I killed you in this remote mountain.\"Ignoring Wei Long's threat, Su Mo was preparing to kill him as he gathered genuine Qi in his fist.Fear instantly appeared on Wei Long's face. His cultivation was at the Peak Lv 2 Qi Cultivation Realm, only a little bit stronger than Wei Shan's, so it was impossible for him to defeat Su Mo.\"Su Mo, don't kill me... don't kill me!\"\"Give me a reason not to.\"\"A reason... A reason...\" Wei Long was anxious like a cat on hot bricks. Suddenly, his eyes brightened up and he said, \"Look, I have a treasure map which can lead you to find treasure.\"\"Treasure map? What treasure map? Show me first,\" Su Mo said.\"I can give it to you if you promise you won't kill me!\" Wei Long was not stupid, so he wanted Su Mo to promise him first.Su Mo scoffed at Wei Long's words. He knew what he was thinking.\"Don't want to give it to me? OK! I'll kill you first and then find it on your body.\"\"Here it is... Here it is!\"Wei Long was scared. He immediately took out a small piece of animal skin and gave it to Su Mo.Su Mo checked it out. Indeed, it was an antique and simple map, obviously from long ages ago.According to the map, there was treasure right in Breezewind Mountain.\"Su... Su Mo, I already gave you the treasure map. Can I leave now?\" Wei Long asked nervously.Hearing no response from Su Mo, Wei Long carefully walked toward the exit.As soon as he was close to the cave entrance, Wei Long looked back with a trace of a viciousness at Su Mo. He was planning to bring some people back from outside the mountain to kill Su Mo.\"Boom!\"At that moment, Su Mo jumped up and punched him.Wei Long was killed on the spot.\"I will never be merciful to my enemies!\" Su Mo said flatly.He had killed countless people in his previous life, but that was his first kill in this world.Returning to the unconscious Wei Shan, Su Mo gave him another punch.Wei Shan was completely killed.After that, Su Mo took the map and decided to look for the treasure.\"Ah-ha!\"Su Mo stopped suddenly with a glint in his eyes. \"If my Martial Soul can devour Beast Souls, can it also devour human Martial Souls?\"He walked back to the two bodies and released his Devouring Martial Spirit.His Devouring Martial Spirit with three halos looked like a bottomless black hole. It spun two times faster than it had at Rank 1 Human Class and had extremely strong suction.Wei Long and Wei Shan had just died. Their Blood Qi and Martial Souls, which had not yet disappeared, were immediately sucked up.The Martial Soul of Wei Shan was a small green tree with two yellow halos. It was Rank 2 Human Class Martial Soul.The Martial Soul of Wei Long was a bird with three halos. Obviously, it was Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul.As the two Martial Souls were instantly swallowed, Su Mo felt his own Martial Soul shake, and its three halos shone brighter.However, his Devouring Martial Spirit did not progress out of Rank 3 Human Class.\"Haha! I was right! I can devour both Beast Souls and Martial Souls!\"Su Mo was overjoyed and surprised by his Devouring Martial Spirit once again.The ability of his Devouring Martial Spirit was beyond imagination.Not only did it have the ability to progress, but it also could devour others' Martial Souls.If Su Mo released his Martial Soul in a fight, his enemy's Martial Soul would be out of their control and devoured by his.\"Well, time to find the treasure!\"Having enjoyed the surprise, Su Mo left the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay7 Storage RingIn the mountains, Su Mo passed through the jungle, guided by his map.He was extremely careful the entire time.He was more than 25 kilometers deep into the Breezewind Mountain, and there were many Class 4 Lv 1 Demonic Beasts nearby, and even some at Class 5.He might not beat a Class 4 Lv 1 Demonic Beasts with his current strength, let alone one at Class 5.Therefore, he was constantly on the lookout.Finally, after another perilous half hour, Su Mo arrived in an overgrown valley.The valley had only one entrance and was surrounded by cliffs that were hundreds of meters high.Full of thistles, thorns and bushes, it looked extremely desolation.Su Mo stayed alert of his surroundings and prepared to escape at the first sign of danger.Although treasures were important, nothing was more important than his life.Su Mo saw that this exact valley was the place marked on the map.He carefully scoured the surrounding environment and soon found a large crack on a rock wall.It was a horizontal crack that was hundreds of meters long and looked like a huge, unfathomable mouth.It was overgrown with weeds and not easily noticeable.Su Mo frowned as he peered inside.Worse than the small cave before, the crevice was gloomy, cold and full of unknown danger.After hesitating for a while, Su Mo gritted his teeth and entered.Since he had already come, he must find something.Danger?Su Mo had never been afraid of danger.As he walked deeper into the crevice, his vision became dimmer and dimmer, until he was completely surrounded by darkness.Su Mo used genuine Qi to improve his eyesight and continued walking.After a moment, the pathway in the crevice began gradually sloping downward.He estimated that he was about ten meters underground.After walking further, Su Mo felt a cold breeze and heard the sound of running water.Intrigued by this change, he quickened his pace.Soon, Su Mo was suddenly met with a bright light. He saw a huge space, which was over five meters tall, over seven meters wide, and unfathomably long.It was a secret underground world.A river flowed through the space toward an unknown destination.Fish swam in the river, and natural cobblestones on the bank gave off a fluorescent light, allowing Su Mo to see the whole underground world clearly.A demolished stone room stood nearby.Several dried bones lay outside the stone room. Their owner had obviously been dead for a long time.\"Has the treasure been taken by others?\"Su Mo walked over slowly and entered the stone room.With a length and width of less than five meters, the room was quite small, and half of it had collapsed.There was nothing inside except for two skeletons in the center.Thinking that the treasure had already been taken, Su Mo was inevitably a little disappointed.\"Hmm?\"Then, he was suddenly astonished.He found that one of the skeletons had not decayed and gave off a light gold hue.\"Why is the skeleton light gold?\"Su Mo was puzzled.This was indeed the skeleton of a human martial artist, but he had never heard of a light gold skeleton.\"What? Is that...\"Su Mo noticed an antique and simple ring on the left hand of the golden skeleton.\"Is that a storage ring?\"Su Mo excitedly snatched up the ring.A storage ring was a treasure capable of storing objects in its own space, so it was quite precious.No one in all of Sunnywood City had a storage ring. Common martial artists stored objects in storage pouches, which were of a lower grade than rings.After taking a deep breath, Su Mo applied genuine Qi to the ring.In the next moment, his awareness entered a dusky space.The space was not big. It had a length, width and height of about five meters.Several scrolls, a long bright sword and a pile of milk white crystals were piled in the corner of the space.With a single thought, the long sword appeared in Su Mo's hand, instantly giving off a sword sound when injected with genuine Qi.Swish! Swish!The long sword emitted a sword ray to the wall one meter away and cut through the hard stone wall.\"What?\"Su Mo was quite surprised. He had not expected the sword to be so strong and to be able to cut through the stone wall so easily.\"Spirit-slayer, Medium Lv 3!\"Su Mo saw several obvious small characters etched on the hilt of the sword.\"It's a weapon of Medium Lv 3?\"Su Mo was immediately overjoyed.There were no Upper Lv 2 weapons at all in Sunnywood City, so a Medium Lv 3 weapon was extremely precious.\"'Spirit-slayer' must be the name of the sword.\"After a while, Su Mo put the long sword back in the storage ring and took out several scrolls.There were four scrolls in total, including Divine Wind Swordplay, Elephants Strength Skill, Shadow Steps, and Primordial Qi Manual.Su Mo opened Elephants Strength Skill gently and read it.Elephants Strength Skill, Upper Lv 5 Body Refining Skill, with a total of 15 levels. After grasping the manual, one's body would become strong like an Archean Fierce Beast with the strength of 10,000 elephants.It enhanced strength from the first level to the third level!It tempered bones from the fourth level to the sixth level!It fortified the body from the seventh level to the ninth level!It intensified extraordinary power from the tenth level to the twelfth level!It amplified Panorama from the thirteenth level to the fifteenth level!As he read the contents of the book, Su Mo was shocked once again.Upper Lv 5 Cultivation Skill?Body Refining Skill?Elephants Strength?What was the force of Elephants Strength? The force of over ten thousand elephants?The \"elephant\" here was not a normal Demonic Elephant but a Post-archean Elephant.An adult Post-archean Elephant had a huge force of more than 10,000 kilograms even without cultivating.How powerful was the force of over 10,000 Post-archean Elephants?Fifty million kilograms?Several billion kilograms?Su Mo suddenly felt overwhelmed by all this information.\"It's an Upper Lv 5 Cultivation Skill! Not to mention, it's a Body Refining Skill!\"Su Mo was overjoyed. This treasure hunt was truly worth it!He knew that Sunnywood City had no book about Lv 3 Cultivation Skill, let alone Lv 5 Cultivation Skill.As one of the two big families in Sunnywood City, the Sus' supreme grade cultivation skill was just Medium Lv 2, which was a Secret Clan Manual, so ordinary members could not cultivate it.Now, he had an Upper Lv 5 Cultivation Skill, and it was even a Body Refining Skill.Body Refining Skill was more precious than Qi Cultivation Skill because of its rarity.It was the true skill of fortifying one's body. The Body Tempering Realm before the Qi Cultivation Realm could only exercise the body.The Sus had only two Body Refining Skills, but the young disciples seldom cultivated them because it was slow-cultivating and time-consuming.Instead, their first target was to improve their cultivation and increase strength.Elephants Strength Skill was even more precious than the Spirit-slayer Sword.\"Huff!\"Taking a deep breath, Su Mo looked at the other three scrolls.Compared to Spirit-slayer Sword and Elephants Strength Skill, the other three manuals were more ordinary.The three scrolls were all Lower Lv 3, and they were respectively on swordsmanship, footwork, and cultivation.Although not as good as Elephants Strength Skill, the three scrolls were still much better than those of the Sus.These were exactly all that Su Mo needed.He did not know what the remaining milk white crystals were, but judging from their strong Spiritual Qi, he knew they were precious.After a while, Su Mo calmed down and put away the other manuals, leaving only Elephants Strength Skill.He carefully read the formulas and key points and memorized them.The underground world was safe and quiet, so he sat down cross-legged, released his Martial Soul, and started cultivating.Elephants Strength Skill was a mysterious cultivation skill that quenched the body with the Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth or one's own genuine Qi.Su Mo's genuine Qi became an elephant-shaped rune, entering and quenching his body.After an hour, he suddenly opened his eyes in shock.\"This cultivation method requires so much genuine Qi!\"After cultivating for two hours, Su Mo's genuine Qi was almost completely consumed.Next, Su Mo could only use his Martial Soul to absorb Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth to quench his body.All the absorbed Spiritual Qi became runes and entered his body.Su Mo's body absorbed Spiritual Qi runes crazily like a bottomless pit.How time flew!Su Mo kept cultivating for eight days, during which he caught fish to sate his hunger.On the sixth day, Su Mo succeeded in cultivating the first realm of Elephants Strength Skill.After this success, his body became much more powerful. The force of his fist alone was more than the force of three tigers, which was stronger than that of a martial artist at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.A martial artist at the Qi Cultivation Realm could increase his force by that of one tiger by increasing a realm of cultivation.The force of one tiger was about 250 kilograms, making the force of three about 750 kilograms.Su Mo felt that his force was almost 1000 kilograms, the force of four tigers.His strength advanced rapidly after cultivating for a few days, which encouraged him to try to complete the cultivation method.If he could grasp more than 10 realms of the cultivation skill, he would be invincible in Skymoon Country, let alone Sunnywood City.However, he obviously felt that cultivating the second realm would be ten times slower than cultivating the first realm.It had only taken six days to cultivate the first realm, but it would take at least two months to completely cultivate the second realm.Therefore, after two days of cultivating, Su Mo stopped.After being here for ten days, it was time to go back.After Su Mo's genuine Qi completely recovered, he buried the golden skeleton, left the underground world, and ran like the wind back to Sunnywood City.The golden skeleton gave Su Mo an opportunity through its storage ring, so Su Mo repaid it by laying it to rest.On his way back, Su Mo suddenly thought of something.Cultivating Elephants Strength Skill needed a great deal of Spiritual Qi, and more Spiritual Qi would be required in future cultivating.If he kept cultivating with this skill, all the Spiritual Qi absorbed by his Martial Soul would be used up.His genuine Qi would not increase, and his cultivation would not improve.If Qi Refining and Body Cultivation were conducted at the same time, the cultivation of both aspects would be greatly slowed down.\"Should I give up Qi Refining and focus on Body Cultivation?\"Su Mo immediately rejected this idea.Carrying out Qi Refining and Body Cultivation at the same time was probably difficult for others, but it would be no problem for him, because he could upgrade his Martial Soul.As long as the level of his Martial Soul improved, so would the speed of absorbing Spiritual Qi, so that cultivation could be enhanced quickly as well.His Martial Soul was now of Rank 3 Human Class, and its speed of absorbing Spiritual Qi was ten times faster than that of Rank 1 Human Class.If his Martial Soul upgraded a few ranks, his cultivating would certainly accelerate greatly.Therefore, Qi Refining and Body Cultivation could only enhance his strength, and they would have little effect on his cultivating speed.\"Haha! It seems like I'll have to kill more in the future!\"Su Mo smiled bitterly, thinking that only killing could help him devour both Beast and Martial Souls!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some of the older disciples had awakened their Martial Souls two years ago, even reaching Lv 7 or 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.Those disciples with high cultivations would not attend these lectures.After returning, Su Mo spotted the Fourth Elder in the field and walked over to him.\"Su Mo, all the other disciples who awakened their Martial Souls with you arrived a long time ago. Why are you only showing up now?\"The Fourth Elder paused his lesson and sullenly asked the unhurried Su Mo.It was a great honor to attend a lecture given by him, and all the other disciples came early to wait for him, yet Su Mo's late arrival showed that he had no respect for the elder.Many of the disciples smirked to see Su Mo get into trouble.Su Mo never expected the Fourth Elder to scold him for being late, since elders' lectures were completely optional.\"Fourth Elder, I just returned from an expedition,\" Su Mo respectfully replied.\"Expedition?\"The Fourth Elder smirked and said, \"With your crappy Martial Soul? You won't achieve anything great in your lifetime. You have nothing to experience!\"Su Mo's expression instantly became cold, and he huffed, \"Fourth Elder, I respect you because you're an elder, but you should know that an elder without good qualities isn't worthy of respect!\"\"What? Are you saying I'm unworthy of respect?\"The Fourth Elder was fuming. How dare a useless fool, a piece of trash provoke him?\"Doesn't calling me trash as an elder make you unworthy of respect?\"Su Mo was also infuriated. Ever since he awakened his Martial Soul, not only did inferior disciples despise him, now even elders treated him with contempt.Did they all think he could be easily bullied?It seemed that he should not keep a low profile in the future!\"How dare you!\"The Fourth Elder shouted in rage. \"Am I wrong? Aren't you trash and a useless fool with your Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul? Is there anyone else in the city with such a crappy martial soul?\"\"That's right! You're nothing but trash! You're a disgrace to our clan!\"One of the disciples yelled.Su Mo turned his head and saw that it was Su Heng who had spoken.With Su Heng's words, other disciples followed suit.\"Right! Rank 1 Human Class! You're a good-for-nothing!\"\"That's right! Shame on you!\"\"...\"Su Heng laughed as many disciples echoed him. He looked at Su Mo and said, \"Su Mo, so many people are calling you trash and a good-for-nothing. Do you know your place?\"The Fourth Elder laughed and said with a sneer, \"Su Mo, I told you so!\"Su Mo walked up to Su Heng and said, \"Su Heng, you call me a piece of trash and a good-for-nothing, but let me ask you this: if you find out you're not as good as me, what does that make you?\"\"I'm not as good as you? Haha! This is the funniest joke I've ever heard.\" Su Heng sneered.Not as good as Su Mo?He had to be joking.Su Mo's eyes glinted coldly, and he said with a smile, \"Su Heng, I'm issuing you a challenge. Do you dare to accept it?\"His words silenced everyone.They all looked at Su Mo in disbelief.Su Mo actually challenged Su Heng?Su Heng was also stunned. After he awakened a Martial Soul of the Rank 4 Human Class, his position in the clan rose greatly, and he was awarded many family resources, which allowed him to reach Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.Yet, this good-for-nothing Su Mo still dared to challenge him?The Fourth Elder was the first to respond. He said to Su Heng in a hurry, \"Since he wants to challenge you, you should teach him a lesson.\"Su Mo's earlier provocation had angered him. As an elder, he could not directly punish his inferior, but luckily, Su Mo presented the opportunity himself.\"Haha! Don't worry, Fourth Elder! I definitely won't disappoint you!\"Su Heng smiled and walked towards Su Mo, his eyes flickering with malice.Ever since Su Mo provoked him in the Book Collection Pavilion, he had been looking for an opportunity to teach him a lesson!This unexpected challenge greatly excited him.\"Su Mo, how many moves of mine can you endure? Three? Or just one?\"Now that he was about to beat up Su Mo, he was in a very good mood.Su Mo lifted his index finger and shook it.\"Haha! You're quite self-aware! At least, you're aware that you can only endure one move.\" Su Heng chuckled.\"No! I mean I only need one move to deal with you,\" Su Mo shook his head and said calmly.Su Mo was not being cocky. Even without using genuine Qi, his physical strength was far more powerful than that of a martial artist of Level 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, rivaling the power of a martial artist of Level 4.\"One Move!\"Everyone was shocked by Su Mo's words and thought he was a retard.Even between martial artists of the same level, it was rare for one to defeat the other with one move. Never mind Su Mo, whose cultivation was much lower than Su Heng's.Defeating Su Heng with one move! They really had no idea if Su Mo was conceited or idiotic!\"Defeat me with one move?\"Su Heng became unpleasant. He did not think a piece of trash like Su Mo would dare look down on him like this.\"If I don't cripple you today, my name won't be Su Heng!\"Boom!With a roar, Su Heng immediately released his Martial Soul, and four yellow halos shined behind him.Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!Su Heng's Martial Soul was a majestic goshawk with sharp eyes.After he released his Martial Soul, Su Heng's aura rose sharply.His cultivation completely exploded.\"Die, Su Mo!\"Su Heng roared and was the first to strike, clawing at Su Mo's chest.Su Heng used his strongest skill so he could defeat Su Mo in one move and let Su Mo know the distance between them.He also wanted Su Mo to know what a joke his earlier pride was!Su Mo raised his hand and punched Su Heng's claw.This was a regular punch without using Martial Soul or Genuine Qi.Su Heng sneered. This good-for-nothing was so arrogant that he wanted to stop him with a punch? Impossible!\"I'll break you!\"Genuine Qi swiftly spewed from Su Heng's hand, and his five fingers turned to silver spears. He wanted to break Su Mo's fist.What happened next was completely unexpected.When his claw hit Su Mo's fist, Su Heng felt a strong force that pushed his hand away and hit his chest.Bang!The fist squarely landed on Su Heng's chest. A raging force surged from Su Mo's fist, fracturing his chest with the sound of cracking bones. Su Heng was thrown about six meters away and crashed on the ground, spewing blood.The audience was completely silent. All eyes were frozen on him.Su Mo defeated Su Heng with a single punch?The Fourth Elder looked at Su Heng, who was lying on the ground in a daze.\"How could it be... How could it be?\"Su Heng was unable to accept the outcome and roared angrily with a twisted expression. However, just after he finished shouting, he was spitting blood again.\"You called me a piece trash and a good-for-nothing every time you opened your mouth, but this piece of trash just defeated you with a single punch. Doesn't that make you worse than trash?\"Su Mo said mockingly, walking to Su Heng and looking down on him.\"You\u2026 \" Su Heng looked livid, ashamed, and resentful.\"And you, Fourth Elder. Do you still think I'm useless now? I've defeated your prodigy, Su Heng, whom you thought highly of. What is he now?\"Su Mo looked at the Fourth Elder.\"You only won through sheer luck. You have nothing to be smug about!\"The Fourth Elder's expression was unpleasant. \"The year-end clan meeting is in two months. When that time comes, you'll realize the true abilities of the outstanding talents in our clan. You're nothing compared to them!\"\"Through sheer luck?\" Su Mo said with a smile, \"I am quite lucky. Perhaps \"through sheer luck\", I can achieve a high ranking in the clan meeting.\"At that, he turned around and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bam! Bam!Amidst constant resounding collisions, Su Mo immersed himself in his fistplay.He pictured himself as the sea, the genuine Qi as the water, and his fist force as great waves dashing against the rocks and constantly gushing.After a long time, he stopped, wiped sweat off his forehead, and sat down in the yard.Su Mo had made rapid progress in cultivating Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist. He had already achieved the Great Completion Realm in just two days.In Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist, threefold fist force was a sign of crossing the threshold, fivefold fist force was a sign of Minor Completion, and sevenfold fist force was a sign of Great Completion. Now that he had achieved sevenfold fist force, he was not far from achieving ninefold fist force, which was a sign of the Completion Realm.With his strength and physical force nowadays, Su Mo was not afraid of martial artists at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm at all.He did not rush to cultivate the scrolls in the storage ring, because it was more urgent to improve his cultivation.\"I have to find a way to increase the rank of my Martial Soul,\" Su Mo murmured to himself.He was now performing both Qi Cultivation and Body Refining at the same time. He needed a great amount of Spiritual Qi for Elephants Strength Skill, but his Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul did not absorb Spiritual Qi quickly enough.The only way to improve the rank of a Martial Soul was to devour Beast Souls and other Martial Souls.Devouring Martial Souls was not practical for now, since he could not kill people in the city, so he had to devour Beast Souls.In addition to hunting for Beast Souls, he could also buy them with gold from any big shop in Sunnywood City.However, they were not cheap. The higher the rank of demonic beast, the pricier its Beast Soul was.As far as Su Mo knew, the Beast Soul of a demonic beast with Lv 3 or 4 Qi Cultivation Realm usually cost over one kilogram of gold each.After pondering for a while, he had an idea and walked to the Master Mansion.\"Haha! Mo'er, you came just in time. I have something to ask you.\"In the Master Mansion, Su Hong smiled at his son and asked, \"Is it true that you beat Su Heng with just one move the other day?\"\"Yes.\" Su Mo nodded.\"Haha! Good, you proved yourself to be my son.\"After hearing his son confirm it personally, Su Hong was very satisfied. He knew that Su Mo might have encountered some miracles, but he did not inquire about them and just said encouragingly, \"Mo'er, just keep trying. Even though your Martial Soul doesn't have a high rank, you may still reach the Spiritual Martial Realm one day.\"\"Yes, Father.\"\"Alright. Why are you here?\"\"I have a favor to ask. Please help me,\" Su Mo answered earnestly.Su Hong was a little bit surprised by Su Mo's seriousness and said, \"Mo'er, I'm your father, not a stranger. Tell me what you want, and as long as I can do it, I will never decline.\"\"Father, I need 500 kilograms of gold,\" Su Mo said.He looked at his father nervously, for fear of refusal.500 kilograms of gold was not a small sum. Usually, the income of the entire Su family for a whole year was only 5,000 kilograms of gold, so 500 kilograms of gold was more than the Sus' monthly income.If Su Mo was still regarded as a genius, it would not be difficult to get him 500 kilograms of gold.However, with his Martial Soul, he was regarded as a piece of trash. Even if Su Hong managed to get him the gold, he would be under a lot of pressure from the family.Su Mo had asked for such a large quantity of gold because he wanted to buy a lot of Beast Souls. As long as he could get enough Beast Souls, the rank of his Martial Soul would soar, and along with it, his cultivation speed.Su Hong was surprised. He stared at his son to make sure he was not kidding, but after a while, he nodded and said, \"Wait here. I'll be back in a minute.\"Then, he left.He did not ask Su Mo why he asked for so much because he trusted his son.Su Mo waited in silence, and soon, Su Hong returned.\"Here are the gold tickets for 500 kilograms of gold. Take them!\" Su Hong passed Su Mo several gold tickets.Holding the tickets, Su Mo took a deep breath and said, \"Father, I won't let you down in the clan meeting in 2 months.\"...Su Mo headed toward the marketplace.After an hour, he stood at the door of a big store. It had a gilded tablet with bold script that read: Purple Gold Pavilion.Purple Gold Pavilion was a three-storey tower covering over 100 acres. It was the biggest store in the entire city. As long as you had enough money, you could get any cultivation skill, elixir, weapon, or anything else related to cultivation.It was said that Purple Gold Pavilion had powerful connections, belonged to a major chamber, and had branches in many cities in Skymoon Country.It held so much power in Sunnywood City that even the Sus and the Weis dared not to get in trouble with it.\"How can I help you?\" asked a young and beautiful maid reverently as Su Mo entered the pavilion.\"I want to buy some Beast Souls,\" Su Mo answered.\"You want to buy Beast Souls? Come with me!\"Su Mo soon followed her to a counter that specialized in Beast Souls, where there stood an old man in gray. He smiled and asked, \"Could you tell me what rank of Beast Souls you want to buy?\"\"How much Beast Souls of Middle Lv 1 cost?\" Su Mo asked.A Beast Soul of Middle Lv 1 was of Class 4 Lv 1, Class 5 Lv 1, or Class 6 Lv 1.\"Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls cost one and a half kilograms of gold each, Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls are two and a half kilograms, and Class 6 Lv 1 Beast Souls are five kilograms,\" the old man answered.\"I'll take 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls,\" Su Mo said after some quick consideration.He had devoured a lot of Beast Souls in Breezewind Mountain, so he knew that Beast Souls of higher rank were more effective.While the prices of Beast Souls doubled with each one level, his Martial Soul was only at Rank 3, so Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls were enough for him.\"What?\"The old man was so astonished, so he checked again:\"Are you sure you are taking 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls?\"\"Yes, is there a problem?\" Su Mo asked.\"I can't call the shots for such a grand deal. I need to inform the leader of Pavilion. Please wait a moment!\" the old man answered and rushed into the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion.Su Mo could do nothing but wait.Soon, the old man rushed back and told Su Mo, \"The leader of Pavilion would like to meet you.\"\"Show me the way,\" Su Mo said.In the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion, there was a small house. Su Mo followed the old man into a side hall.He was stunned when he got inside.There was an extraordinarily stunning woman sitting in the hall.She looked like she was in her late 20s, with refined facial features on her charming face, and her skin was snow-white. She wore a tight leather skirt that fit her curvy body perfectly.This was an enchanting beauty with peerless charm!She was the leader of Pavilion, Luo Huan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the sound of her voice held a hint of charm.Su Mo quickly regained his composure while secretly scolding himself for losing focus and almost being captivated by her.However, this woman was truly exceptional. He had rarely seen anyone like her, even in his past life.\"Please take a seat, Young Master Su.\"Luo Huan arched her thin brow slightly and could not help but feel impressed by Su Mo.She was very confident about her looks. Any man who saw her was often rendered speechless or would have a lewd expression on his face.Meanwhile, this 14-year-old young man was only slightly stunned before regaining his composure.\"Thank you, Her Excellency.\"Su Mo sat down, confused by the fact that she knew his name.However, Su Mo soon realized that he was now \"well-known\".\"Ha ha! Don't be so formal. My last name is Luo, and I'm a couple of years older than you, so you can call me Sister Luo,\" Luo Huan said with an unwavering and charismatic smile.Um!Su Mo was dumbfounded, and then immediately nodded his head.Luo Huan continued, \"I heard that Young Master Su wants to purchase 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, but our pavilion only has 150. Would Young Master Su be willing to have the remaining 50 replaced by Beast Souls of other levels?\"\"Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls would be fine!\" said Su Mo.He did not mind that Class 4 were less effective because he could simply take more.\"Yes, Young Master!\" Luo Huan nodded, took out a gray pouch, and handed it to him.\"Here are 150 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, and 85 Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls. That'll be 500 kilograms of gold. Also, this storage pouch is a gift from me to you.\"Su Mo was shocked by her generosity.This storage pouch was definitely not cheap. Even the cheapest pouches cost over 35 kilograms of gold.\"Ha ha! Thank you so much, Sister Luo!\"Su Mo did not object and accepted the storage pouch.After buying the Beast Souls, Su Mo immediately said his goodbyes and left.\"My Lady? I heard that young master Su only has a Martial Soul of Rank 1 Human Class, why are you...?\" asked a frowning old woman, who appeared silently in the hall.\"Aunt Xu, Su Mo isn't as simple as he seems. I can feel that he has incredibly strong Qi blood, much stronger than that of other martial artists of his level.\"...While Su Mo was out purchasing Beast Souls in Purple Gold Pavilion, there was a meeting going on in the Su meeting hall.\"First Elder, why have you called this meeting?\"asked Su Hong, who was seated at the head of the table and eyeing the First Elder.\"Master, I heard from the Accounting Department that you took out 500 kilograms of gold today. What were you planning on using this money for?\"The First Elder Su Yue, a grumpy middle-aged man in his 40s, interrogated Master Su Hong as soon as the meeting began.As the First Elder of the Sus, Su Yue was second only to the Master in power and status.He was also the only person in the Sus who had the nerve to speak to Su Hong in this manner.\"These 500 kilograms of gold were funds for Su Mo to purchase resources for his cultivation,\" admitted Su Hong frankly.\"What!?\" The First Elder was shocked.All the elders were also completely shocked!\"Su Hong, are you insane?\"The First Elder came to his senses, sprung to his feet, and roared, \"Su Hong, how dare you use 500 kilograms of gold to cultivate your failed son! As the Master, what right do you have to spend that much gold on your own son? The Sus doesn't consist of only your family. I won't allow it!\"\"That's true. Su Mo is a failure. We shouldn't waste so much on raising him!\" agreed the Fourth Elder, Su Tai.\"Exactly, Master. It's so selfish of you to care only about your own son!\"\"How could you waste so much gold on raising your degenerate son?\"\"...\"All the other elders spoke to echo the First Elder.\"Are you all done talking?\"Su Hong waited for everyone to quiet down and scanned the room of elders coldly. \"I've already spent the 500 kilograms of gold. This issue is over. If there's nothing else to discuss, let's end this meeting!\"\"What? It's all been spent already?\"Everyone was stunned.The First Elder's countenance hardened.His son, Su Yu, had awakened a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and was regarded as the first genius in the Sus, yet all his monthly cultivating expenses barely exceeded 50 kilograms of gold.Yet, a piece of trash like Su Mo somehow managed to use up over 500 kilograms....After successfully buying his Beast Souls, Su Mo was extremely excited and impatiently ran home.He was eager to see what level his Martial Soul would advance to after devouring these Beast Souls.\"It should be enough to advance to Rank 6 Human Class!\" thought Su Mo.\"Ha ha! Little lady, with me, you'll feel like a goddess every day.\"\"Get out of my way!\"\"Damn, don't flatter yourself. It's an honor to be selected by me.\"Suddenly, Su Mo heard a ruckus and saw three young men ahead of him surrounding a maid in blue.She was extremely pretty, with a stunning face, pale skin, and willowy figure.The leader of the young men was about 16 or 17 years old and sickly pale, and he was staring lewdly at the maid.The maid was terrified but could not escape, since she was surrounded.\"Ha ha! You have nowhere to run!\"The young man cackled perversely and reached out to grab her hand.BAM!Suddenly, a palm reached out and cast away his hand.\"Damn it, what nuisance has the nerve to interfere with my business?\" the young man yelled angrily.He turned around to see who it was, and immediately chortled, \"Wow! Look who it is, the top 'genius' of the Sus!\"The young man heavily emphasized the word \"genius\" with a jeering expression on his face.It was indeed Su Mo.\"Come here, Qingqing!\"Su Mo gestured for the maid to stand behind him.This maid in blue also belonged to the Sus and was called Su Qingqing. Although Su Mo was not close to her, he still knew who she was.He could not bear to watch the inferiors of the Sus being bullied without doing something.\"Brother Su Mo!\"As soon as Su Qingqing saw Su Mo, she hurriedly hid behind him like he was her savior.\"Only you, Wei Lin, would be so shameless to harass women in broad daylight!\" chuckled Su Mo at the perverted young man.The young man's name was Wei Lin. He was the second son of the Master of the Weis.He was notorious in Sunnywood City for using his clan's power as an excuse to commit all kinds of atrocious deeds.Countless women had been violated by him.\"How dare such a piece of trash like you interfere with my business. You must be tired of living!\" said Wei Lin in a wild and boasting tone.\"Are you calling me a piece of trash?\" Su Mo's expression hardened. He was instantly enraged by the title.\"That's right. You have a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul. That makes you a piece of trash!\" scoffed Wei Lin.\"You have two choices: One, give Su Qingqing to me, kneel and bow your head to me in repentance, and call me grandfather three times, so that I will let you go. Two, I'll shatter all your limbs, then take Su Qingqing with me.\"Wei Lin was determined to have Su Qingqing today. He had pined for her beauty for a long time, and he was not willing to give up his opportunity to have her.Although Su Qingqing belonged to the Su clan, she was only a common inferior, and her parents had little status in the clan. Even if Wei Lin forced himself on her, there would be few consequences.\"Kneel and bow my head in repentance? Call you grandfather three times?\"Su Mo's eyes flashed with rage. \"Are all members of the Wei clan the same? Both Wei Long and Wei Lin love to make people bow down to them!\"\"I'm giving you the span of three breaths to disappear from my sight, or you'll have to deal with the consequences,\" said Su Mo coldly.He was not at all scared of these three people.Aside from Wei Lin, who was at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, the other two with him were both at Lv 3.\"What?\"Wei Lin was shocked and then scoffed, \"Deal with the consequences? How dare a piece of trash like you say such bold things to me!\"\"You two, attack him! Don't beat him to death. Just break his limbs,\" ordered Wei Lin.\"Ha ha, don't worry young master. Leave it to us!\"His two companions cackled and rushed toward Su Mo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bang!With two crashes, the men flew back and fell to the ground heavily with painful screams.\"Wei Lin, do you really think these two degenerates can break my limbs?\" Su Mo said with a disdainful smile.\"You...!\"Wei Lin had not expected that Su Mo could defeat them in merely a second, so he felt very angry.\"Humph! You're at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm. No wonder you're so arrogant.\"Wei Lin laughed at him and threatened. \"But your strength is nothing compared to mine. Today, I'll not only break your limbs but also destroy your cultivation and make you a truly useless piece of trash.\"\"Ho!\"As Wei Lin shouted out loud, he fully released his Lv 4 Qi Cultivation, and his Martial Soul rose up behind him, bathed in yellow light.His Martial Soul was a demonic wolf of Rank 3 Human Class, so it had three yellow halos.His talent was only average, but he was older and had awakened his Martial Soul last year, so he was able to reach Lv 4 Qi cultivation Realm....The commotion had already attracted many spectators.They all burst into a discussion since the two were both \"well-known\".\"He's Su Mo, the young master of the Sus. He'll get a really bad beating today for insulting Wei Lin, the second son of the Weis!\"\"Yeah! He might be capable of defeating those two subordinates, but he can't defeat Wei Lin.\"\"\u2026\"Standing behind Su Mo, Su Qingqing instantly became pale after seeing Wei Lin releasing all his spirit.She was only a normal girl who had not awakened her Martial Soul, so Wei Lin's menacing aura made her very nervous.\"Brother Su Mo, I shouldn't have gotten you involved. It's best if you leave! Don't worry about me,\" Su Qingqing said to Su Mo hastily.Su Mo smiled and said, \"Qingqing, relax. He's all bark and no bite.\"\"Hum! Su Mo, you're so arrogant and ignorant.\"Wei Lin punched toward Su Mo's lower abdomen, shouting, \"Go to hell!\"He intended to destroy Su Mo's elixir field first.\"You're asking to die!\"At the same time, Su Mo punched toward Su Heng's fist, channeling his genuine Qi and sevenfold fist force coupled with the strength of his body.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist!\"Bang!The two fists crashed into each other, releasing a blast wave around. Su Mo stood in place, while Wei Lin was knocked back and exposed his vulnerable torso.Dong!Su Mo seized this opportunity to quickly rushed forward and punched toward Wei Lin's lower abdomen.\"You piece of trash! How dare you?\"Wei Lin was very shocked, but he did not have enough time to dodge it. In a hurry, he tried to use his left arm to block the attack.Crack! Pop!After the sounds of breaking bones followed a sound similar to that of popping a balloon.Wei Lin's arm was snapped by the powerful force, and his bare bones exposed.Even though his arm had blocked Su Mo's fist, his elixir field was shattered.\"You... you destroyed my elixir field?\"Wei Lin became numb shock, then he instantly started to scream.\"Since you want to destroy mine, you run the risk of having yours destroyed. Get used to being a useless waste!\" Su Mo said coldly.He would never hold back against such dirtbags.Wei Lin was at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, but he had indulged so much in wine and women that his genuine Qi was weak. Therefore, he was barely better than Su Heng, who was at Lv 3 Qi cultivation Realm.After saying those words, Su Mo pulled the shell-shocked Su Qingqing away, leaving the stunned crowd behind....In the mansion of the Sus\u2014After coming back to the mansion, Su Mo went to his room.He took out his storage pouch and poured out over 200 gray crystals.These were Soul Crystals, which were used to contain Beast Souls.Since the beasts' level were too low, the Beast Souls had lost their consciousness after death.If not contained in the Soul Crystals, Beast Souls would vanish in a very short time.Su Mo released his Martial Soul, a dark vortex, floating behind him with three shining yellow halos.Crack!Su Mo crushed two Class 4 Lv 1 Soul Crystals, and the Beast Souls instantly floated out.He hurriedly channeled his Devouring Martial Spirit, which immediately produced a strong suction and devoured the two Beast Souls.His Devouring Martial Spirit did not change after devouring two Beast Souls, so he continued to crush the crystals.Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!10 Beast Souls!20 Beast Souls!40 Beast Souls!As he devoured the 60th Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Soul, the Devouring Martial Soul abruptly trembled, and the fourth yellow halo burst out.Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!Su Mo felt excited and continued devouring.When he finished all Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls, he started to devour Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls.He could clearly feel that these Beast Souls were more powerful than those before.10 Beast Souls!30 Beast Souls!50 Beast Souls!100 Beast Souls!140 Beast Souls!Even after he devoured the 140th Beast Soul, he was depressed to find that his Martial Soul had still not progressed.The higher the level of his Martial Soul, the harder it was to progress.\"I hope the last 10 Beast Souls won't disappoint me.\"Crack! Crack! Crack!After he crushed and devoured the last 10 all at once, his Devouring Martial Soul finally changed.Another yellow halo appeared again.Five yellow halos. It was Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul!He was overjoyed and immediately used his Martial Soul to absorb the aura from heaven and earth with all his strength.Strands of aura quickly convered to him and entered his body.After his Martial Soul leveled up, it absorbed aura 10 times faster than it did at Rank 3 Human Class.After a long time, he stood up in high spirits.\"Su Yu, you're called the first genius of the Sus, and you have a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul, right? Just wait until I crush you in the clan meeting.\"Su Mo smiled. \"Also, Liu Yushan, you'll know how stupid your choice was.\"Then, he went to the clan armory and picked out a steel long sword.He needed to practice swordsmanship.He could not use the Spirit-slayer Sword often because its level was too high.He knew that it was not smart to show off his wealth.He would cultivate not only Divine Wind Swordplay but also Shadow Steps and Primordial Qi Manual.These three manuals were Lower Lv 3 Cultivation Skills. His strength would greatly increase when he had successfully cultivated them.Divine Wind Swordplay belonged to the Wind System and had four moves.The first move was Gale Blade.The second move was Separating Remnant Clouds.The third move was Wind Roaring in the Sky.The fourth move was Divine Wind Kill.Each move was harder to practice, and more powerful than the one before.The key point of Divine Wind Swordplay was speed. The moves must be fast beyond the limits.Shadow Steps was a profound footwork. When he reached its Great Completion, he could move shadowless.As to Primordial Qi Manual, a cultivation skill, the practicer could cultivate Primordial Genuine Qi, which was 10 times more powerful than the genuine Qi in Clouds Skill.In the following days, he practiced swordsmanship and movement in daytime and cultivated Primordial Qi at night. As a result, his strength was stably improving.One day, he was practicing swordplay in the yard.The water-like sword radiance formed a shining sword curtain, and the unstoppable sword Qi sliced the air into pieces.Knock! Knock! Knock!Right at that moment, someone began knocking furiously on his door.Su Mo frowned and thought, \"This man isn't knocking on my door, he's pounding on it, like he wants to smash it to pieces.\"\"Who is it?\"Su Mo opened his door with a cold face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Mo, you'd better go to the meeting hall at once.\"Su Tai smirked with a hint of gloating in his eyes.\"The meeting hall? What for?\"Su Mo felt confused.Su Tai impatiently scolded, \"Stop with all the questions! You'll know when you get there.\"\"Humph!\" Su Mo grunted and walked toward the meeting hall.\"Loser, you shouldn't be so arrogant. I can't wait to see you be punished today.\"Su Tai sneered and followed closely behind.In the meeting hall\u2014Su Hong sat in dignity in the seat of honor.Beneath him, several elders and junior disciples of the Sus were sitting to his left.On the right were two middle-aged men and three young men of the Weis, all of them fuming with an accusatory look.\"Why hasn't Su Mo arrived yet?\"A middle-aged man of the Weis wearing a brocade robe asked sullenly.\"Haha! Our Fourth Elder has already informed him. He'll be here any minute,\" said an elder of the Sus with a conciliatory smile.\"Su Mo hurt my son. How will you punish him?\" Another middle-aged man asked.He was Wei Wankong, the Master of the Weis.\"Ah...\"The present elders of the Sus remained speechless. They all wanted to say that the Weis could punish Su Mo however they liked, but they did not dare to speak before Su Hong.Nobody wanted to talk first and infuriate Su Hong.\"Su Hong, your son hurt my son and destroyed my son's cultivation. If you don't do something about it, the Weis will never forget this,\" said Wei Wankong, who coldly scanned the room and fixed his eyes on Su Hong.\"Since Su Mo had evil intentions and hurt your son, we should let you punish him at will.\"The First Elder replied before Su Hong could.His eyes were full of gloating.\"How dare you?\"Su Hong abruptly shouted and looked at him. \"First Elder, are you the Master? Can you make decisions for the Sus?\"\"You...!\"The First Elder was furious but could not refute him, and his expression suddenly became stony.\"Master Wei, we don't clearly know about the incident and can't make a decision until my son is here,\" Su Hong said to Wei Wankong.\"Humph! I'm looking forward to a satisfactory result.\" Wei Wankong sneered.\"It will definitely meet your demands!\" The Sus' elders showed fake beaming faces.While some of them cursed Su Mo inwardly.\"Why did that piece of trash choose to hurt Wei Lin, out of all people?\"\"That loser just got us into deep water! \"None of the elders were willing to offend the Weis. While the Sus and Weis were regarded as the two largest clans, the latter was more powerful than the former.The Weis had ruled over Sunnywood City for over 200 years, so they had a profound background.However, the Sus only rose into prominence in the past few decades, so their background was less profound than the Weis'.The Weis sneered at the desperate Su elders, their faces full of contempt.Everyone waited in silence.The atmosphere in the hall was very grim.After a while, footsteps sounded outside of the door.Su Mo and the Fourth Elder entered the hall.\"Su Mo, do you confess your crime?\"The First Elder suddenly yelled as soon as Su Mo entered the hall.\"Confess my crime?\" With a glint in his eyes, Su Mo asked, \"First Elder, what have I done wrong? Why should I confess?\"\"You maliciously mutilated the second son of Master Wei. You're the scum of our clan and have embarrassed us greatly. What do you have to say for yourself?\"The First Elder, with his determined gaze and unstoppable aura, wanted to fix the crime on Su Mo.\"Su Mo, describe to us how you hurt Master Wei's second son.\" Su Tai, the Fourth Elder, also ordered.The other elders also echoed him. Now that the First Elder had taken the lead, they did not hold back.Now, all the elders of the Sus were on the First Elder's side.The first elder not only was as powerful as Su Hong, but also, more importantly, he had a genius son.Su Yu had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul, and as the first genius of the Sus, he would rule the clan someday.All of the Weis only watched silently.\"Maliciously? Scum?\"Su Mo laughed and indifferently asked, \"Elders, as soon as I entered the hall, you said I'm malicious, called me a scum, and want my confession. How are you so sure that I'm guilty since you know nothing?\"Glancing at the Wei clan, Su Mo realized that the Weis came here!\"How dare you to quibble?\" The First Elder yelled, and his looked extremely gloomy.Su Mo's eyes grew cold. He sneered and said, \"First Elder, you asked me to confess before hearing my explanation. Am I guilty just because you say I am? Is everything I said quibbling? Are you an elder of the Sus or the Weis?\"\"You...!\"The First Elder was incensed. He did not expect Su Mo to be so sharp-witted.\"It's enough, Mo'er. Tell us about it in detail.\"Su Hong said as he glared at the First Elder with narrowed and piercing eyes.\"Alright!\"Su Mo immediately gave them a specific description of what had happened.However, he did not mention Su Qingqing by name and only explained that Wei Lin wanted to abduct a girl.Su Qingqing was just a common inferior in the Sus, and he did not want to get her in trouble.\"Humph!\"As soon as Su Mo finished speaking, Wei Wankong burst out shouting, \"Douchebag, you hurt my son, and you deserve to die, period.\"\"That's right. You're so mean! Death sentence!\"\"You should have known that you would die for provoking the Weis.\"The Weis all started to yell one by one.\"Wei Lin attempted to break my limbs and destroy my elixir field, so I was forced to maim him.\"Su Mo ignored the Weis and instead asked indifferently, \"Elders, in your opinion, was it criminal of me to defend myself against someone who wanted to destroy me?\"\"Outside of the mansion, all disciples of our clan can only be bullied by others, and if we fight back, we'll be criminals. Am I right?\"His brilliant words made all the elders sullen and silent.\"Master Wei, it's pretty clear that your son wanted to break my son's limbs and destroy his elixir field, so he had to defend himself. Your son brought the trouble to himself.\"\"It's impossible!\"Wei Wankong shouted loudly with a cold expression. \"My son's misfortune is all your son's fault. If you don't let me handle this little piece of sh*t, you'll face the wrath of the Weis!\"\"Humph! Destroying scumbag like your son is doing everyone a favor!\" Su Mo disdainfully responded.\"Fu*ker, go to hell!\"Wei Wankong screamed angrily, suddenly stood up and flew toward Su Mo.A bleak aura of killing desire radiated from his body and enveloped the entire hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thud! Thud!Both men were struck back a few steps. They were equal in this confrontation!The pale-faced Su Mo, who was standing nearby, was pushed back a dozen steps by the air blast, narrowly escaping injury.\"Wei Wankong!\"Su Hong yelled thunderously with killing desire in his eyes. \"How dare you attack my son in my own house? Are you questioning my authority?\"\"Humph! Your son got lucky today!\"Wei Wankong was not rattled by the furious Su Hong at all and wore a calm expression.\"Mo'er, are you okay?\" asked Su Hong hastily as he went over to Su Mo, glancing over Wei Wankong.\"I'm fine. Thank you, father!\"Su Mo nodded and looked at Wei Wankong with cold eyes full of killing desire.\"You old dog, I'll keep this in mind and kill you some day!\"Su Mo's bleak voice was filled with terrifying killing desire.\"A loser like you? Kill me?\"With a disdainful expression, Wei Wankong then signaled to someone behind him with a wink.A haughty young man from the Weis walked out holding a spear and said, \"Trash, you maimed the second young Master of our clan, which is unforgivable. I, Wei Liang, challenge you to a fight to the death. Do you dare to accept?\"Wei Wankong could not kill Su Mo in one strike and obviously could not do it again, so he ordered Wei Liang to challenge Su Mo and kill him.\"Fight to the death?\"The Sus were all shocked.As a genius disciples, Wei Liang had reached Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm at a very young age. He actually challenged Su Mo!\"Wei Wankong, Wei Liang is 17 years old and three years older than my son, right? Besides, hasn't his cultivation has reached Lv 6?\"Su Hong frowned and asked flatly, \"You let an older disciple with a higher cultivation challenge my son. Do you have no shame?\"He knew exactly what Wei Liang was thinking.He just wanted to kill Su Mo in battle!Wei Liang smiled faintly. \"Master Su, I'm indeed three years older than Su Mo, but this isn't an excuse. I'll always be three years older than him, so does that mean I can never fight him?\"He smirked at Su Mo contemptuously and said, \"Su Mo, if you admit that you're a piece of trash, destroy your own cultivation, and break your arms and legs, I won't challenge you.\"Su Mo coldly glanced at him. \"Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm?\"\"Alright, I accept your challenge. But our fight will take place two weeks later.\"Su Mo agreed to his challenge without hesitation.\"Mo'er...\" Su Hong was surprised.\"Father, I have a plan. Please don't worry!\" Su Mo said with a wave of his hand.Su Hong frowned with worry, but he knew that his son was a calm person and never reckless, so he did not say anything else.\"Well, Su Mo, remember what you said. In two weeks, at the Central Square of Sunnywood City, you and I are going to fight to the death.\"Wei Liang was overjoyed and had a trace of contempt in his eyes.At that moment, the Weis laughed with disdain.\"Su Mo would definitely die in two weeks.\"The elders of the Sus were also secretly sneering at him. Su Mo was too stupid to bear Wei Liang's provocation, and sealed his own fate.Su Mo's death was insignificant to them. He was merely a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.\"Master Su, see you in two weeks. Farewell!\"The Weis left in high spirits.News of Su Mo and Wei Liang's fight to the death quickly spread throughout Sunnywood City.Suddenly, that was all everyone was talking about!In the courtyard\u2014Su Mo and his father sat face to face.\"Mo'er, was it too reckless to accept Wei Liang's challenge?\"Su Hong was still worried.\"Father, don't worry. I'm sure I can defeat Wei Liang in two weeks,\" Su Mo said confidently.Looking at Su Mo's confident face, Su Hong could do nothing but nod. Su Mo's strength had greatly increased recently, and Su Hong thought it might have been something miracle happened to him, so he did not say anything more.With a sigh, Su Mo took out a milk-white crystal from his storage pouch and asked, \"Father, do you recognize this crystal?\"\"Hmm?\"As soon as he saw it, Su Hong immediately became alert and asked, \"Mo'er, this is a Spiritual Stone. Where did you get it?\"\"Spiritual Stone? I got it by accident. Father, what can it do?\" Su Mo asked.\"Spiritual Stones contain a great amount of Spiritual Qi that can be absorbed into the body to increase cultivation. However, only the Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists can use them. A Spiritual Stone has so much Spiritual Qi that it could blast a Qi Cultivation Realm martial artist to death.\"\"They are very expensive. Yours looks like the cheapest Lower Spiritual Stone, but it still worth thousands of taels of gold.\"\"They are extremely rare, and even our entire clan can't get many in a year!\"\"It's that valuable?\" Su Mo was suddenly shocked.\"Father, I have a lot of Spiritual Stones. You can take them!\"Su Mo waved his hand, and a small pile of at least 100 glittering Spiritual Stones suddenly appeared on the stone table.\"What?\"Su Hong widened his eyes in disbelief.\"100 Spiritual Stones?\"\"Each worth thousands of taels of gold?\"That would be hundreds of thousands of taels of gold, which was many times the yearly income of the Sus.\"Father, I happened to come upon an ancestor's cave, and these Spiritual Stones were all from there,\" Su Mo said honestly to his puzzled father.Su Hong supressed his shock, thought for a while, and said, \"Mo'er, since they're yours, you should keep them. They're enough for you to buy a lot of cultivating resources to quickly improve your strength.\"Su Hong did not accept the Spiritual Stones.\"Haha! Father, just take them! I have a lot!\"Su Mo smiled. He had about 200 Spiritual Stones. He took out half of them, and there were about 100 left in the storage ring.\"There are still some more left?\"Su Hong was stunned but immediately nodded happily and said, \"I didn't think you'd get so lucky. Well! In that case, I'll take them. With these Spiritual Stones, the breakthrough of my cultivation is just around the corner.\"He had a beaming face.Su Hong's cultivation had been stagnant at the Peak Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm for many years, but with so many Spiritual Stones, before long, he could progress to Lv 5 Spiritual Martial Realm.Once he succeeded, he would have few opponents in Sunnywood City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Su Hong left, Su Mo was about to begin cultivating.A beautiful young girl with thin brows and bright eyes came into his yard. It was Su Qingqing.\"Brother Su Mo, I'm so sorry for causing you all these troubles. If it wasn't for me, the Weis wouldn't have been after you!\"Su Qingqing felt incredibly guilty and repeatedly apologized to him.When she heard that the Weis were demanding revenge and that he and Wei Liang would have a battle to the death in two weeks, she was incredibly anxious.\"Haha! Qingqing, don't blame yourself. I'll be fine!\"Su Mo consoled her with a smile. \"Wei Liang is no match for me at all. Do you think I'll lose to him?\"\"Of course not. You'll definitely be the winner!\" said Su Qingqing confidently, shaking her head.\"Haha! Then stop worrying!\"\"But...\"Although Su Qingqing was quite confident that Su Mo would defeat Wei Liang, she was still anxious.After all, Wei Liang was a powerful genius among the Weis.\"Qingqing, you will awaken your Martial Soul next year, right? If you cultivate well and become powerful, nobody will dare to bully you ever again!\"He had a good feeling about this innocent girl, mostly because she was very pretty.\"Yes, I'll become powerful in the future, and then I can protect you!\"Her determination was very adorable.After chatting with Su Qingqing for a while, Su Mo sent her off and started to cultivate.He sat down cross-legged, concentrated hard, and released his Martial Soul to absorb aura from heaven and earth.Although he currently stood at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, he also cultivated Primordial Qi. This made his genuine Qi very dense and powerful, so he was no worse than a Lv 4 Qi Cultivation opponent.Additionally, his physical strength had the force of four tigers, so he could also physically rival a Lv 4 martial artist without using Qi.Even so, for now, he was no match for Wei Liang, who stood at two realms higher at Lv 6.He had already cultivated Divine Wind Swordplay and Shadow Steps, but he was only in the beginner's realm after three days and had limited combat forces.After two hours, he opened his eyes and stopped cultivating.Having packed some food and water into his storage ring, he set out with his longsword.He was heading to Breezewind Mountain again.While his Martial Soul had reached Rank 5 Human Class and cultivated much faster, it would still be difficult for him to defeat Wei Liang in two weeks if he cultivated the normal way.The fastest way to improve his power was through farming and killing.His Devouring Martial Spirit was insanely strong because it could not only level up his martial soul by devouring Beast Souls and the others' Martial Souls, but also his cultivation by devouring Blood Qi and energy.Therefore, fighting and killing would be the quickest method to increase his strength.He also wanted to buy Beast Souls, since he possessed many Spiritual Stones. Even a few stones would sell for the price of tens of thousands taels of gold.However, he dismissed this idea because precious Spiritual Stones should be saved for the future when he was at a higher level.When passing through the clan's noisy martial practice field, he noticed several disciples gathering together with noise and excitement.In the center of the martial practice field, two young men were stirring up wind and Qi in an intense training battle.\"Hmm? It's Su Yu!\"Su Mo recognized one of them as Su Yu, whom he had not seen for some days.The young man Su Yu was fighting was a stocky young man.Su Peng, a strengthful young disciple among the Sus. It was rumored that he had reached the Peak Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm at only the age of 18.Their fight was even-matched, and it was hard to tell who was winning.\"Brother Su Yu is really amazing. I can't believe he becomes powerful as Su Peng in such short time!\"\"Brother Su Yu has a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and is the first genius of our clan, so I'm not surprised.\"\"Since Brother Su Yu was prioritized by the clan and in seclusion for a long time, it makes sense that his strength has boomed.\"\"Haha! I think that Brother Su Yu will soon be as powerful as Su Tianhao, the top master among the Sus' inferiors.\"The disciples burst into a heated discussion as the fight intensified.Su Yu finally figured out Su Peng's weakness and fiercely attacked him, forcing him to stumble back again and again.Su Yu took the opportunity to launch his final attack. He punched Su Peng's chest, making his opponent spit blood and stumble back.\"Wow, Brother Su Yu won!\"\"Long live Brother Su Yu!\"\"\u2026\"Following Su Yu's victory, the field went into a big uproar.Su Yu stood proudly in the middle of the field in high spirits and look around in a haughty manner.\"Hmm?\"Then, he caught a glimpse of Su Mo nearby and laughed disdainfully.\"Wow, 'the number one genius' of our clan is here!\"He lifted his chin, looked down on Su Mo and emphasized \"the number one genius\" to express his sarcasm.\"Haha, the loser is here!\"\"The loser will be dead in a few days!\"\"\u2026\"Many disciples looked at Su Mo scornfully.Although he had recently made his name for defeating Su Heng and destroying Wei Lin, the second son of the Wei clan, everyone thought that his glory would end soon.He was doomed to be a loser for the rest of his life due to his Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.Su Mo glanced at them coldly and kept walking with no regard for them.\"Stop!\"Su Yu's eyes grew cold, and he stepped out of the crowd and stood in Su Mo's face.\"How dare a loser ignore me!\"This enraged him greatly.\"Su Mo, let's have a training battle. I won't fight back until after 100 moves.\"Su Yu sneered.\"No fighting back until after 100 moves?\"\"That is a blatant insult to Su Mo!\"\"I'm not interested!\" Su Mo indifferently replied.\"Not interested? Hmph! In two weeks, you won't get to fight me even if you want to!\"Su Yu scoffed, \"You must be really ignorant or cocky to fight Wei Liang to the death, so you'd better enjoy your last few days.\"Su Yu sneered in his heart and thought, \"You're asking to die by choosing to fight against Wei Liang.\"\"My fights are none of your business.\"\"Haha, of course your survival has nothing to do with me.\"Su Yu slightly smiled and said, \"Actually, since we awakened our Martial Souls, you don't deserve my attention at all.\"\"You're no match for me in terms of honors, status, or women!\"Su Yu was very happy with his present situation. He had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and was the first genius of his clan. Furthermore, both his cultivation and clan status had rapidly improved.Su Mo was nothing to him.He felt refreshed upon mocking Su Mo, as if he were floating in heaven.\"Is that so?\"Su Mo arched his brow and sneered back, \"Honestly, I've never wanted to compete with you because you're just a laughable scoundrel who doesn't deserve my attention.\"\"You...!\"Su Yu was furious, and his face turned livid.\"Hmph! You only have a few more days to gloat! In two weeks, I'll be there and witness your death.\"Su Yu held back his anger upon thinking that Su Mo would die soon.Su Mo gave him a disdainful smirk and left without saying anything.\"Am I going to die?\"\"We'll see who dies!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn a shady path 80 kilometers away from Sunnywood City, with the long sword on his back, Su Mo used his body movement to rush toward Breezewind MountainBreezewind Mountain was over 100 kilometers away from Sunnywood City, but with his speed, he could reach it within one hour.\"Hmm? It smells really strongly of blood!\"On his way to the mountain, Su Mo keenly smelled blood in the air.\"What happened?\"\"Where from?\"He stopped, and after some pondering, he decided to follow the smell.After a while, he came across a small village with about 100 households.However, the whole village was in ruins. Most of the houses had collapsed, and corpses scattered on the ground.Scarlet blood dyed the ground and converged into streams, making the place look like hell itself.That was where the thick smell of blood was coming from.\"What is this?\"Su Mo was quite appalled at this sight, even though he thought he had seen everything.\"Who could be so vicious to slaughter an entire village?\"He was extremely incensed, and his eyes grew cold.After taking a deep breath, he rushed into the village.The whole village was dead silent, but the strewn corpses, broken limbs, and scarlet blood were everywhere. It was appalling.Many of the corpses were dead women, children, and old people. He saw a three or four-year-old little girl lying in a pool of her own blood, with a knife stabbed through her body.All of these things made him very angry, and his face darkened.\"Who is so inhumane that he can commit such a formidable crime?\"\"Ah! Ah!\"Suddenly, he heard a faint groaning sound.Su Mo hastily ran toward the sound, and he soon arrived at a collapsed ruin and found an old, gray-haired man.The old man was covered in blood with half of his body crushed under the ruin. He was heavily wounded, but still alive.\"Sir, are you alright?\"Su Mo hurriedly walked forward, removed the ruins, and helped the old man up.He realized that the old man's stomach had been cut open, and his guts were flowing out. There was no chance he could survive.\"What I've done to you, my Lord! It's unfair! Ooh, ooh...!\" The old man was in a daze and burst into tears.\"Sir, what happened?\" Su Mo asked him.The old man stopped crying and regained consciousness gradually.\"Please save my granddaughter! Please! Please!\" implored the old man as he looked at Su Mo and abruptly grabbed his hands.\"Sir, don't worry! Just tell me what happened,\" Su Mo asked.\"The Bloody Blade Stockade looted our village and slaughtered all of us.\"The old man was in grief, yet his eyes were filled with resentment.\"The Bloody Blade Stockade?\"Su Mo's eyes narrowed, for he had heard of the Bloody Blade Stockade.It was said that the Bloody Blade Stockade was a bunch of bandits stationed 100 kilometers from Sunnywood City who often committed cruel crimes like this.They were evil in every way, but they were very smart to not attack powerful groups and only targeted the weak.Therefore, the Bloody Blade Stockade had always gotten their way for years instead of being uprooted.\"How many were there? What's their strength?\"Su Mo's eyes were cold, and he felt a raging desire to kill them.\"It was a small team with about 20 people, but they all were powerful martial artists above Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"The old man had lost too much blood, and his voice trailed off. \"Our village had only five martial artists of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and none of them could rival them, so they were all killed in a short time!\"\"Young man, please save my granddaughter. She was abducted, and as long as you can save her, I'll be your servant in my next life.\"He pleaded to Su Mo, without considering if Su Mo would be able to defeat those bandits.Judging from Su Mo's expensive clothes, the old man could tell that he was an inferior of some big clan, so he would certainly save his granddaughter.\"Sir, don't worry! You got it.\"Su Mo nodded seriously.He was experiencing a mix of emotions. He knew that the laws of nature dictated that the strong would always be to prey upon the weak.\"Well! Well! Thank you...!\"The old man gave him a faint smile, then his head tilted, and he died.\"The Bloody Blade Stockade, huh?\"Su Mo stood up with his fists clenched, and his eyebrows furrowed with killing desire. \"You dirtbags don't deserve to live.\"Then, he dashed off and followed the horse tracks out of the village.The village had just been robbed, so the bandits should still have been nearby.He was going to kill all of those animals....\"Giddy up! Giddy up!\"The Bloody Blade Stockade bandits spurred their war horses along a mountainous path.They were slowed down by the 20 to 30 ladies they had captured.Some of these ladies were 30 or 40 years old, and some were only 12 or 13 years old. No matter if they were married women or maidens, they were all very pretty.\"Brothers, let's take a rest here and continue after a meal,\" ordered the tall leader of the bandits.Soon, the bandits stopped to rest. They lit a bonfire and roasted some game.Then, they gathered all the ladies together.\"Haha! I didn't expect so many pretty women this time. I can't wait any longer!\"A bandit smiled disgustingly and lewdly looked at those ladies.\"Haha! I haven't touched a woman for over a month, so let's really enjoy ourselves this time!\"Another scar-faced bandit laughed, fixed his eyes on a maiden in green, and said creepily, \"This girl is beautiful! Damn! I've never seen such a pretty girl in my life.\"A 15-year-old maiden in green stood out among the ladies with her outstanding looks, which attracted the bandits' attention.The simple clothes on her could not disguise her elegance.\"Humph! If you want to save your little ass, you'd better leave her alone. I'm about to give her to the chief!\" The leader scolded coldly.\"Haha! Since she's a give for the chief, I won't touch her.\"The scar-faced bandit shivered at the thought of the chief's cruelty and gave the leader a big smile.Thud! Thud! Thud!\"Hmm?\"Right at that moment, one of the ladies started to run away while the bandits were not paying attention and made it dozens of meters away in the blink of an eye.\"Haha! Leader, leave her to me!\"The scar-faced bandit laughed coldly and chased her in excitement, catching her in no time.\"Haha! Little cunt, trying to run under my watch? I'll teach you a lesson right now!\"He chuckled vilely and dragged her into a grassy field.\"Ah!\"Not long after he disappeared, a loud scream emerged from the grass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Has the third son of Ma become impotent? Did he finish as soon as he went in?\"\"Haha! What a loser. Let's see if he still has the guts to brag in front of us.\"The bandits could not help but mock him when they heard the screams coming from the bushes.However, their expressions soon changed.After a long time, the scar-faced bandit still had not emerged.The bushes were completely silent.\"What happened? Why hasn't he come out yet?\"All the bandits were confused.\"Ma the Third...\"The bandits began yelling his nickname, but there was no reply from the bushes.\"You two, go take a look,\" ordered the leader of the bandits to two men next to him.The two looked at each other and walked into the bushes.However, they did not make a single sound after entering the bushes, as if they had completely disappeared, just like the scar-faced bandit.All the bandits finally could not sit still any longer and stood up with grave expressions.\"Damn it, what happened?\"\"Fu*k! What the hell!\"\"Humph! I want to know who has the guts to mess with the Bloody Blade Stockade!\"The leader of the bandits yelled with a grave expression, \"You two, stay here to watch over these women. The rest come check it out with me!\"Clang! Clang! Clang!They unsheathed their steel sabers and approached the bushes in a fan shape.\"Huff... Huff...\"Many of them were panting and alert, prepared for any potential danger.Soon after they stepped into the bushes, they saw three mangled corpses in the grass.It was the scar-faced bandit and the two bandits who had come to check on him.The three bodies did not even look like human anymore. They were completely emaciated and drained of their blood and Qi, as if they had been mummified.If not for their clothes, the bandits would not be able to tell that the corpses were their companions.\"Hiss!\"\"Hiss! Hiss!\"Although these bandits were cruel murderers who were numb to death, they all hissed in shock.\"Is this.... the work of a vampire?\" one of the bandits asked.However, there was no one in sight.\"No, they were killed by a human. Look at their necks.\"An astute bandit noticed that there was a thin slice on each of the three corpses' necks.Killed in one sword stroke!This was the same for all three men.\"Ah! Ah...!\"Suddenly, something strange happened again.Two screams came from behind them.The terrified screams of the women followed.\"Damn it...!\"All the bandits retreated in shock.The bandits saw that the two men they had left behind were lying on the ground.Next to the two men stood a young man. He was around 15 years old, held a bloody sword, and was looking at them coldly.When the women saw this man run out and swiftly kill two people, they began screaming in terror.\"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you!\" said the young man to the women.That young man was Su Mo.He had followed the scar-faced bandit and saw him trying to do unspeakable things to a woman, so he entered the bushes, killed the scar-faced bandit, and saved the young woman.Then, he killed the other two bandits.Afterwards, he also devoured all of their blood and Qi.All three bandits were at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, and after Su Mo devoured their blood and Qi, he immediately reached the Peak Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.Then, when the bandits came to inspect the situation, he circled back around and killed the two guards.Thus, Su Mo effortlessly killed five men in a row.\"Who are you? How dare you challenge the Bloody Blade Stockade?\" asked the leader, who sized up Su Mo coldly.\"I'm the one to kill all of you!\"Su Mo's eyes were cold, and he exuded a fierce murderous aura.\"Humph! Peak of Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, and you want to kill us all?\"The bandit leader sensed Su Mo's cultivation and chuckled. He waved at his subordinates, and they immediately surrounded Su Mo.The leader was at Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm and very powerful. Three or four of his men were at Lv 4, and the others were at Lv 3.With all their strength, he naturally was not afraid of a scrawny Lv 3 kid.However, he still did not let his guard down, since this kid had somehow mummified all the bodies that he killed.Also, this kid must be considerably powerful since he had managed to kill all those men without a sound.\"You'll see.\"Su Mo grinned. The benefits from devouring all the blood Qi had begun to boil his blood.\"Kill him!\"The bandit leader ordered his men with a wave, while he stood still and watch.\"Kill!\"\"Kill! Kill!\"Four bandits roared, and rushed toward Su Mo and cut with their glinting steel sabers at him.The bandit leader chuckled. He believed that this attack would instantly kill the kid.All four attacking bandits were at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm. Together, they would overpower even a Lv 4 martial artist.Su Mo scoffed at their attack and said, \"Go to hell!\"\"Whoosh!\"Su Mo used Shadow Steps to dodge their attack.\"Whoosh!\"A dazzling sword radiance appeared, and Sword Qi shot out everywhere.\"Ah! Ah...!\"With a series of cries, all four bandits immediately collapsed and died.Killed with one stroke!\"What...\"All the other bandits stared in disbelief.They could not understand how this kid at Lv 3 Qi cultivation could be so powerful.\"Kill! Everyone! There's no way a low-level kid can kill us all!\"The bandit leader roared with a livid face and led the rush forward.He carried a giant billhook, which he forcefully brought down upon Su Mo.This billhook weighed at least 100 kg. Combined with the leader's cultivation of Level Five, one hack was enough to split even metal into two.Whoosh!Su Mo did not dodge his attack but instead met it with his sword.Gale Blade!Su Mo channeled all of his genuine Qi and his physical strength to carry out the first move of Divine Wind Swordplay, Gale Blade.Clang!The billhook and sword violently crashed into each other and gave off a thunderous noise.Su Mo's entire body shook, and he and the bandit leader both staggered back three steps.Both men were equal in this attack!Although the bandit leader was at Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was two whole realms higher than Su Mo's, his cultivation skill and martial arts techniques were only Medium Lv 1.Su Mo was only at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, but his Primordial Original Qi was incredibly strong and made his true ability equal that of Lv 4.Also considering his physical strength, he could easily contend with Lv 4 martial artists.He also had cultivated a Lower Lv 3 Martial Skill, the Divine Wind Swordplay.If he had begun cultivating this skill earlier, he would have been able to defeat the bandit leader with that stroke.\"How is this possible?\" the bandit leader roared in shock.\"How can you be so powerful at only Peak Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bandit leader was incredibly shocked by Su Mo's abilities.He was fully aware of his own strength, and common Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm martial artists were no match for him.How could he not be shocked that he was forced back by a Lv 3 martial artist?\"Ahhh!\"While the bandit leader was lost in confusion, two more screams tore through the air.Su Mo's sword was as fast as lightning and as nimble as wind, so his sword Qi was unstoppable.Three more bandits were instantly killed.This small group of bandits used to have 20 men. However, Su Mo killed nine men before, and he just killed three more, so now there were only eight left.\"Die!\" Su Mo\u00a0yelled, his body as swift as a flash. With a glint of his sword, two more bandits were slashed in the waist and collapsed to the ground, spilling their guts everywhere.\"Hurry! Surround and kill him! Hurry!\" screamed the bandit leader.He raised his giant war saber and charged toward Su Mo.This time, Su Mo did not directly block his attack. He used his swiftness to weave between the men, and with every flash of his sword, he struck down a bandit.\"Screw you!\" roared the bandit leader angrily. No matter how hard he swung his war saber, he had never touched a hair on Su Mo's body.After Su Mo practiced the Lower Lv 3 body move, Shadow Steps, his dexterity had been greatly increased. Although he had only begun to cultivate Shadow Steps, his movement was way beyond the bandit leader's capabilities.Besides their leader, the other bandits were all at Lv 3 or Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, so very few stood a chance against Su Mo's sword.Even if they blocked one strike, they could not block another.With Sword Qi spreading everywhere and sword radiance shining, Su Mo killed one man with every step he took.Soon, the bandit leader had become a commander without soldiers.Even the men who tried to run were killed by a single strike before they could get away.\"You've killed so many men of my Bloody Blade Stockade! I won't let you get away with it!\"The bandit leader issued this threat but turned around to run away. He could tell that he was at a disadvantage.There was no way that he could kill his opponent!\"You're going nowhere!\"Su Mo blocked the bandit leader's path.\"Don't push me! Even though I can't kill you, you also can't kill me!\" The bandit leader yelled.\"Really? I've told you that you will all die today!\"Su Mo sneered condescendingly, which immediately enraged the bandit leader.\"You must be looking for death! I'll show you just how powerful I am.\"The bandit leader roared, and his Martial Soul rose up behind him, bathed in yellow light.His Martial Soul was a three-meter-tall Fierce Bear.After activating his Martial Soul, the bandit leader's abilities at least multiplied. He drew out his shining war saber and swung it forcefully towards Su Mo.Su Mo did not dodge it and stood silently in place.The bandit leader was overjoyed to see this, and he channeled all his force into his swing to incapacitate Su Mo with one strike.Su Mo smiled coldly. When the bandit leader's war saber was about to come down, he sheathed his sword.This action instantly shocked the bandit leader.\"Is this boy dumb?\"However, he was even more excited. Now that his enemy had sheathed his weapon, this was his chance to kill him.Just as the bandit leader's war saber was about to reach Su Mo, a shining long sword appeared in Su Mo's hand with a flash.This was the Spirit-slayer Sword, a Medium Lv 4 weapon.Su Mo grasped the Spirit-slayer Sword and swung it up to meet the war saber.Clang! Splash!When the weapons met, the bandit leader's war saber was shattered. The Spirit-slayer Sword did not lose any momentum and cut through the bandit leader's neck like lightning, causing his head to fly up and spew blood everywhere.Huff!Su Mo let out a sigh after killing all of the bandits.\"Spirit-slayer Sword, you didn't let me down!\"Su Mo looked at the longsword in his hands and smiled. His Medium Lv 4 weapon was really exceptional.Weapons of different levels and grades varied greatly in quality, not to mention that the bandit leader's weapon was a common Lv 1.Since the two weapons were not even at the same level, it was not surprising that his sword could slice through the war saber.When faced with these degenerates, Su Mo was not stupid enough to fight fairly.After killing all the bandits, Su Mo looked towards the kidnapped women, who were all shell-shocked and unresponsive.\"Alright, all of the bandits have been killed! You're all free!\"Su Mo said, waking the women.\"Thank you, kind sir!\"All the women kneeled on the ground and bowed their heads to Su Mo in thanks.\"You can all get up! It isn't safe here. Go back to your village first!\"Su Mo waved his hand and asked them to stand. Although their village had been destroyed, he could only ask them to go back.Luckily, most of the bandits had war horses that the women could ride back to the village.\"Sir, I'll never forget your kind deed today. Could you tell me your name? I'll bear it in mind forever.\"A young girl in green quietly said as she nervously walked up to Su Mo.She was the girl whom the scar-faced bandit had lusted after, and the one who was being taken as a gift to chief brigands.Her skin was as white as snow, her beauty unparalleled, and her eyes as clear as a spring. Although she was wearing rags, she exuded an undeniable elegance.The girl had the appearance of a fallen angel, making her desirable but incorruptable.Su Mo had only just realized this outstanding beauty among the women.\"How could such a small village produce such a gem?\"Judging purely by appearance, this girl surpassed even Luo Huan, the leader of Purple Gold Pavilion. However, she seemed shyer than the charismatic Luo Huan.\"My name is Su Mo! Go back first, and I'll come later and help you bury your relatives.\"Su Mo smiled and led a war horse over to her.\"Yes, sir.\" The girl lightly nodded.After everyone had left, Su Mo stared at the pile of corpses with excitement glinting in his eyes.\"With all these blood essence, breaking through my cultivation shouldn't be a problem!\"Su Mo immediately walked over, sat down cross-legged, and released his Devouring Martial Spirit.The longer he waited, the more essence these bodies would lose. Moreover, their Martial Souls would disappear after a while, which would be a great loss!Su Mo used all his force to activate his Devouring Martial Spirit, which quickly sucked in all the bandits' Martial Souls and Blood Qi.Most of these bandits' Martial Souls were Rank 2 or 3 Human Class, so Su Mo's Martial Soul was not affected after devouring them.However, the great amount of Blood Qi became a surge of pure energy after it was devoured and absorbed into Su Mo's body.Su Mo suddenly experienced a spike in genuine Qi!Boom!In the blink of an eye, Su Mo's cultivation broke through the bottleneck of Lv 3 and entered into Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm.The Blood Qi was so strong that Su Mo's cultivation continued to rise after reaching Level Four.Early Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!Middle Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!Late Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!Peak Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!Finally, after Su Mo finished devouring everyone's Blood Qi, his cultivation stopped at Peak Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was only a step away from Lv 5.He was not disappointed and was instead satisfied that he had increased his cultivation by one level.\"If I keep killing and taking other people's Blood Qi and Martial Souls like this, won't my cultivation skyrocket?\" Su Mo thought excitedly.However, he shook his head. \"If I continue this, even though my strength will improve quickly, I will also lose my humanity and become a bloodthirsty monster.\"Su Mo had always been a moral person who had no sympathy for enemies and villains, but slaughtering the innocent was no different from those bandits.Then, he took a deep breath, stood up, took all of the mummies' belongings and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were big pits behind the village that had been dug to bury the bodies.After talking to the men, he found out that they were a hunting squad that had survived the slaughter because they were out hunting.\"You saved so many of our women and killed all the bandits to avenge us. Thank you very much! Please accept my gratitude!\"The leader of the hunting squad instantly bowed to him respectfully after learning that Su Mo had saved the women.\"Brother, you're welcome. Let's first bury the deceased and help them rest in peace!\"Su Mo said and waved his hand to the leader.\"Alright!\"The leader nodded silently and continued to carry the bodies.\"Hmm?\"Su Mo looked around and saw the gorgeous maiden from before kneeling down before a body and crying.The corpse belonged to the old, gray-haired man whom he had talked to.\"She must be that old man's granddaughter!\" Su Mo instantly realized.Walking over and squatting down next to her, he lightly patted her shoulder and consoled her. \"I'm so sorry for your loss!\"However, the maiden continued sobbing, as if she had not heard him.\"Alas...\"Su Mo secretly sighed and thought, \"Parting with the dead is the most painful thing in life!\"\"Master, I'm an orphan and was abandoned in the wilderness as a child. Grandpa found me and raised me.\"The maiden slowly said in a bitter tone, \"Grandpa treated me like his own granddaughter, always saving the best things for me and offering me a good life, but it's all my fault that he's dead.\"\"Why am I not a martial artist?\"\"If I'd been a powerful martial artist, I would've been able to protect grandpa and our village!\"\"If I'd been a powerful martial artist, grandpa and all the other villagers wouldn't have died!\"\"\u2026\"She kept talking, and Su Mo could not tell if she was talking to him or just murmuring to herself.Her body shook continuously, and big teardrops rolled down her cheeks.Su Mo listened to her in silence.\"Survival of the fittest means that the strong preys on the weak, so things never end well for the weak!\"After a long time, she stopped crying.\"You must toughen up if you don't want your grandpa to worry in heaven.\" Su Mo could not do anything but comfort her.\"I'm so sorry to let you see me like this!\" she said bashfully, wiping the tears from her face.\"It's fine. Let's first bury your grandpa and help him rest in peace,\" said Su Mo. They then buried the old man behind the village.After that, Su Mo was about to leave.The villagers had buried all the deceased and came here to show their gratitude to him again.Su Mo returned all the belongings the bandits had stolen to the villagers and was ready to leave.\"Young master!\"Suddenly, a voice chirped behind him. Su Mo turned around and saw the maiden in green.\"I... I want to follow you. Would you be willing to take me in?\"She slowly walked toward Su Mo and was tightly gritting her teeth, as if she had made up her mind.She stared at Su Mo with her bright, beautiful eyes, as if she was afraid of being rejected by him.Su Mo was startled and did not know why she would want such a thing.\"Why do you want to follow me?\"He, of course, did not mind having such a beautiful girl around.However, he still had to understand her intentions. After all, he could not foolishly take her home simply due to her attractiveness.\"I want to learn to practice martial arts with you.\"Her tender face was full of resolve, and she said, \"I think you're a good person. Only by following you can I be a powerful martial artist.\"\"You can rest assured that I won't be a burden to you, since I can cook, wash clothes, and do chores. I'm even willing to be your servant, so please take me in!\"She looked very pitiful, and her eyes widened anticipation. After she spoke, she started to kneel.Su Mo hurriedly pulled her up and said, \"Since you're willing to follow me, come, and I'll teach you cultivation.\"\"Of course, if you want to leave in the future, I won't stop you.\"Su Mo sighed in his heart. \"The maiden may have seemed weak, but she was strong-willed and resolute.\"\"Thank you, Young Master!\"She gave him a rare and charming smile, which stopped his heart.Then, Su Mo took the maiden back to Sunnywood City.They did not ride horses and instead walked back.She had not awakened her Martial Soul to be a real martial artist, but she had reached Lv 6 Body Tempering. Thus, she could easily walk dozens of kilometers.On the way, Su Mo chatted a lot with her and got a general understanding of who she was.She was called Gu Lanxi, a very beautiful name.She was 14 years old this year and 15 in two months, so she was almost the same age as him.At dusk, they reached the Su clan.\"Holy crap! Where did Su Mo find such an appealing girl?\"\"The piece of trash probably knows that he'll die soon, so he wants to enjoy his last two weeks.\"\"You may be right! Damn it, why all beauties are wasted on losers!\"When Su Mo brought Gu Lanxi into the mansion of the Sus, many people were instantly drawn to her looks.Many disciples spoke sourly out of admiration, jealousy, and in most cases, contempt.Su Mo led her into his yard and arranged a room for her.His yard had four rooms. One was for himself, and the other three were empty.\"Xi'er, this is where you'll stay.\"Su Mo helped her clean up the room and gave her some daily essentials. \"If you need anything later, just let me know.\"\"Thanks a lot!\" She lightly nodded.\"As for cultivating, I'll buy you some elixirs to help you accomplish your Body Tempering as soon as possible.\"He added, \"When you finish your Body Tempering, I'll find a way to help you awaken your Martial Soul.\"\"Alright. Sorry to bother you!\"The maiden felt somehow touched and greatly respected him.\"Haha! Xi'er, you don't need to be so polite. I'm very casual.\"Su Mo lightly smiled and said, \"Don't call me 'young master' anymore, it sounds very awkward. You can just call me by my name.\"\"I... I can't do that!\"She hastily waved her hands and anxiously said, \"You did me a great favor, so how can I directly call you by your name? That is quite disrespectful. Besides, I'm only your maid, and I wouldn't dare to call you that.\"Er!Su Mo was instantly speechless and thought, \"She's too uptight!\"\"Who says you're my maid? From now on, you're my little sister,\" Su Mo said seriously.Hearing this, she suddenly widened her bright eyes and stared at him intently.\"So you don't want to be my little sister?\" Su Mo deliberately pretended to be angry and asked her.\"No... No, I want to!\"Her face was blushing, and his words touched her heart.\"Haha! Come on, call me brother,\" Su Mo smiled and said teasingly.\"Er... Brother Su Mo!\" she said very quietly with her head down, her face blushing with shame.\"Haha...\" Su Mo burst into laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its sword momentum was sometimes like a light breeze, and sometimes a wild gale.At that moment, Su Mo's heart was completely calm, and he had a clear grasp on Divine Wind Swordplay. His entire body was one with the air, and in his mind appeared the paths, the speed, and the changes of the wind.He continually thrust his sword, practicing the moves of Divine Wind Swordplay again and again, faster and faster.\"Gale Blade!\"His long sword danced with its radiance that broke through the air, giving off a piercing sound.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"The wind was integrated with the sword so that as the sword moved, the wind followed.\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"A strong gale arose, and the sword momentum then combined with the wind, sending the sword shadow everywhere.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"The wind stopped, and the sword shadows disappeared, and a loud whistling sound arose. A beam of sword radiance shot out swiftly from the sky at a lightning speed.The beam shot through the hard stone wall with a crack, sending rock fragments everywhere and leaving behind a half-meter-long mark.Huff!Su Mo sheathed his sword and stood up.\"If I keep cultivating the four moves of Divine Wind Swordplay at this speed, I'll reach its Minor Completion in no time!\" Su Mo thought happily.Although he had not yet reached the Minor Completion of Divine Wind Swordplay, he was very close. His attack was more than twice as strong as when he first started.\"This is how powerful Lv 3 martial arts techniques really are!\" Su Mo exclaimed inwardly.Su Mo had not left the city for five to six days and spent most of his time cultivating martial arts techniques.Besides making great progress in Divine Wind Swordplay, he was also steadily improving his Shadow Steps, which was also close to the Minor Completion.As for his cultivation, Su Mo was still at Peak Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm. His realm still needed some time to stabilize after increasingly so rapidly last time, so it would be hard for him to make another breakthrough for a while unless he devoured a large amount of Qi blood again.Although his cultivation had not increased, his physical strength had greatly improved. He now had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul, which could devour aura from heaven and earth for his physical cultivation 10 times faster than before.He was almost done with Stage 2 Elephants Strength Skill. His physical strength was equivalent to 1250 kilograms, or the strength of five tigers, and he could contend with an Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm martial artist.\"Brother Su Mo, you should rest for a while!\"A girl in white walked out of her room, holding a cup of steaming tea, and handed it to Su Mo.\"Haha! Xi'er, are you comfortable here?\" Su Mo asked with a smile.Gu Lanxi's white robe elegantly floated around her body, making her look like an angel.As the saying goes, clothes make the man. Su Mo had only bought her two pieces of regular clothes, but they made Gu Lanxi even more stunning.Even Su Mo could not help but feel tempted by such a timeless beauty.\"Yes, Brother Su Mo. I'm very happy here.\" The young girl smiled charismatically.\"Haha! Xi'er, you've been here for so long, but I haven't shown you around yet. I'll take you on a walk outside,\" said Su Mo with a smile, \"and we'll buy some cultivating resources on the way.\"\"Yes!\" The girl lightly nodded.Su Mo and Gu Lanxi walked out of the Sus.Su Mo originally wanted to find his father, but since Su Mo had given him the 100 Spiritual Stones, Su Hong had been in seclusion. It seemed that he was breaking through the cultivation bottleneck, so Su Mo did not want to disturb him.Su Mo went to Purple Gold Pavilion again with Xi'er.When they walked into the lobby, a young maid walked over and said, \"Hello, how can I help you?\"\"I want to see your pavilion leader, Luo Huan!\" said Su Mo bluntly with a smile.\"What?\" The young maid looked at him in shock and thought, \"What kind of person do you think you are to directly ask for our leader?\"\"Master, our leader is very busy. If you need to buy elixirs, weapons, or other goods, I can help you with that.\" The young maid refused politely.She had encountered many men who had demanded to see the leader.Her beauty had charmed countless people, so many men came by only to see her for themselves.She glanced at Xi and thought, \"This young man is such a player! Isn't he satisfied with his beautiful companion?\"\"Oh, really? Can you handle exchanges involving over 500kg of gold?\" asked Su Mo with a smile.\"Ah! 5... 500kg of gold?\"The young maid was instantly shocked and hastily said, \"Please wait a minute, Master. I'll go get the leader immediately.\" She then hurried off.The young maid did not suspect Su Mo. Purple Gold Pavilion was very reputable in Sunnywood City, and no one would dare to cause trouble there.Soon, she swiftly returned and said to Su Mo, \"Master, our leader is waiting for you!\"Once again in the side hall, Su Mo saw Luo Huan, the leader of Purple Gold Pavilion.Luo Huan sat in the main seat of the side hall, wearing the same tight leather dress. Her body was voluptuous, and her eyes were full of charm and temptation.From afar, Su Mo could smell a faint and seductive fragrance.No man she seduced would be able to resist her.\"After such a long time, Leader Luo is still beautiful as always,\" said Su Mo with a calm face, not revealing a hint of his infatuation.\"Haha! Young Master Su is joking. How can I compare to the beauty next to you!\" said Luo Huan.She looked at Xi'er and could not help but feel amazed.She had a powerful background and had traveled far beyond Sunnywood City. However, she had never seen such a pure beauty.Hearing Luo Huan's praise, Xi'er instantly became bright red and lowered her head shyly.\"Leader Luo, what price does this pavilion offer for Spiritual Stones?\" asked Su Mo, cutting to the chase.\"Does Young Master Su have Spiritual Stones?\" Luo Huan arched her brows and asked with surprise, \"How many do you have, and of what quality are they?\"Su Mo opened his hand to reveal a milk-white crystal and said, \"It's this type of Spiritual Stone, but I only have few.\"Su Mo planned on only selling a couple of such stones. Even though Purple Gold Pavilion had an impeccable reputation, it was too risky to reveal all the expensive stones at once.Besides, five Spiritual Stones were already worth an enormous amount of wealth.\"This is a Spiritual Stone of Lower Grade. I can offer you 130kg of gold for one stone,\" said Luo Huan, who looked at it and quietly gasped.\"Alright, I have five Spiritual Stones, so that equals 650kg of gold.\"Su Mo took out four more stones and gave them to her.\"Young Master Su, do you need to purchase anything else?\" asked Luo Huan, accepting the Spiritual Stones with a smile.Su Mo saw her smile and felt as if he had been ripped off.\"I want Beast Souls. How much is a Class 9 Lv 1 Beast Soul?\" asked Su Mo.Now, low-level Beast Souls did very little to increase his Martial Soul, so he wanted to buy Class 9 Lv 1 Beast Souls.\"20 kg of gold.\"\"Please give me 30!\"Su Mo currently had so much money that he did not care about 500kg of gold.\"Also, I want 20 Body Tempering Elixirs.\"Those were for Xi'er so that she could quickly complete her Body Tempering.Body Tempering Elixirs could fortify her body constitutions and increase her physical strength.However, these elixirs could only be taken once every two weeks, and taking more had no additional effect.Luo Huan gave the order, and soon Su Mo had 30 Class 9 Lv 1 Beast Souls and 20 Body Tempering Elixirs.\"By the way, Leader Luo, I also have some Demonic Cores that I can sell to you!\"Su Mo took out from his storage ring some Demonic Cores that he had captured in Breezewind Mountains.\"Alright, 30 Beast Souls is 600kg of gold, and 20 Body Tempering Elixirs is 50kg. That's 650kg in total, so you still have 100 kg left.\"\"These Demonic Cores are worth 25kg, so I'll give you 125kg of gold.\"Su Mo took the gold ticket for 125kg and said, \"Leader Luo, since I've bought everything that I needed, farewell!\"\"Haha! Goodbye, Young Master Su!\" said Luo Huan with a charming smile.After he left, Luo Huan fell into deep contemplation.\"So many Beast Souls. What is he hiding?\"\"If it weren't for his low-level Martial Soul, I would recommend him to the island.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many of their specialties contain demonic beasts' meat, which will greatly help your cultivation!\"\"Okay! It's all up to you, Brother Su Mo!\"Xi'er nodded and felt greatly moved by Su Mo's kindness. Over the past few days, she had gotten to know his character.He was gentle, easygoing, generous, and sincere.She was overjoyed that she had made the right decision to follow him.Rongxuan Restaurant was the best one in Sunnywood City.The interior decoration of the five-story building was extremely luxurious. This bustling restaurant was where many wealthy martial artists ate and entertained guests.Su Mo walked up to the door, holding Gu Lanxi's hand.\"Brother Su Mo, it must be expensive to eat here!\"Xi'er could not help but comment at the sight of this luxurious restaurant. Born into a poor family, she naturally felt a little timid about such an upscale place.\"Haha! Xi'er, we're tycoons now. Money isn't a thing!\" said Su Mo with a smile.The girl grew silent as she remembered witnessing Su Mo spend more than 500kg of gold in the blink of an eye.They immediately caught many people's attention as soon as they entered, but most of the attention was focused on the girl.Their eyes were full of infatuation.They were jealous of Su Mo and thought, \"How did the loser young master of the Sus manage to win such a beauty?\"\"Su Mo, over here!\"Suddenly, a voice called to him from the lobby of the restaurant.\"Hmm?\"Su Mo turned around and found that Su Heng had actually called to him.Su Heng and another teenager were sitting near the window.The handsome young man was donned in fine clothes and was gazing at them intently.To be exact, he was gazing at Xi'er.Su Mo frowned at them. He knew that the young man in fine clothes was the son of the Sunnywood City Governor\u2014Lin Xiao.\"Why are they eating together?\"However, since Su Heng buried the hatchet and invited him, Su Mo would not put on airs, either.Su Mo walked over while holding her hand.Seeing them hold hands, Lin Xiao's eyes glinted with an undetectable trace of bleakness.\"Should we sit here?\" asked Su Mo when standing in front of them.However, Su Heng did not respond to Su Mo, and Lin Xiao did not even glance at him.Lin Xiao stood up, smiled gently at Xi'er, and said, \"Hi, my name's Lin Xiao, son of the city governor. Please have a seat!\"Having glanced at him, Xi'er turned to look at Su Mo.If Su Mo did not answer, she would not accept anyone else's invitation.Su Mo sneered at Lin Xiao's hidden intention, but he still said, \"Xi'er, let's sit here!\"He then pulled a chair over to sit down.\"You don't deserve to sit here, you loser.\"Lin Xiao suddenly barked at Su Mo with a darkened expression.\"What do you mean?\" Su Mo squinted and asked coldly.\"Didn't I make myself clear? You, a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, don't deserve to sit with me!\"Lin Xiao glared at Su Mo, thinking, \"This guy really has no self-awareness!\"Subsequently, he smiled gently at Xi'er and said, \"Please do me the honor of sitting with me and drinking the most delicious wine in Rongxuan Pavilion.\"With a sincere expression, Lin Xiao invited Xi'er once again.Her's eyes revealed a hint of disgust, and she refused to sit down. She became annoyed by their humiliation of Su Mo.\"You two are jerking me around?\" Su Mo asked indifferently without becoming enraged.\"Yes, we are! So what?\"With his face full of disdain, Su Heng proudly said, \"Su Mo, if you know what's good for you, you'd better give this beauty to the son of the city governor, or you'll be in deep water.\"\"Su Heng, as a disciple of the Sus, how dare you to kiss up to him?\"Su Mo smiled mockingly and said, \"Was my last lesson to you not enough? Are you itching for another beating?\"\"You...!\"Su Heng was furious. It took him two entire weeks to fully recover from the injuries Su Mo inflicted.Su Mo's words had uncovered this bad memory. If he were not wary of Su Mo's strength, he would have struck him at once.\"Su Mo, right? I won't say it again. She stays, but you get out!\" Lin Xiao stopped smiling and ruthlessly snapped.\"Get out?\"Su Mo raised his eyebrows, coldly smiled, and gently flicked his extended hand.Crack!A crisp and loud slap echoed in the restaurant.Suddenly, a clear palm print appeared on Lin Xiao's face.The scene silenced the crowd around and shocked them. They obviously had not expected that the useless young master of the Sus would actually slap the son of the city governor on his cheek!\"This guy is done for. Even if he isn't killed, he'll at least lose a layer of skin!\"Everyone was watching the incident with great interest and taking guesses at what would happen.No one was happier than Su Heng who could now watch Su Mo be taught a lesson by the son of the city governor.\"Haha! Su Mo, you're exceptionally stupid!\"\"The son of the city governor is at Lv 5 Qi cultivation Realm, and you should never provoke him. You'll meet a miserable end today!\"Su Heng wildly laughed in his mind.The slap was even more unexpected for Lin Xiao, who was now frozen in shock.He soon snapped out of it. Feeling the stinging mark on his cheek, he scanned the eyes of all the people watching him.The raging and boiling anger in his mind was all-consuming.As the son of the city governor, he had been widely adored for all his life.No one in Sunnywood City dared to hit him. Even his father, the city governor, did not beat him at all.However, he had been slapped by a loser in public.\"You... slapped me?\"His deep voice sounded like a beast's roar in the back of his throat, and his eyes flashed like those of poisonous snakes.\"Are you a retard or a stupid fu*ker? Don't you know whether you've been slapped?\"Su Mo acted in a nonchalant fashion as if he had done nothing.Everyone fell silent and looked at Su Mo with sympathy.\"Is he a fool?\"\"His Martial Soul is trash, and so is his mind!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who gave a piece of trash like you, with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, the guts to strike me? Do you know what the consequences are?\"Lin Xiao narrowed his eyes, but he did not immediately explode in anger.\"I also don't understand why you keep calling me a piece of trash. Where does your confidence come from? Is it simply because you're the city governor's son?\" Su Mo smiled mockingly and continued. \"In my eyes, your status is completely worthless!\"\"Go to hell!\"Lin Xiao could not control his anger any longer. He swung his fist at Su Mo without hesitation.His fist hurtled towards Su Mo's face with a great gust of aura.Many of the spectators even closed their\u00a0eyes and resisted to watch what was about to happen.They knew that Su Mo's face would be bloodied beyond recognition if Lin Xiao's fist met its target.Su Heng was the only one who was grinning from ear to ear. He wanted nothing more than for this punch to kill Su Mo!However, Lin Xiao's fist was unexpectedly stopped halfway.A palm was wrapped around Lin Xiao's fist, directly blocking his punch.This palm firmly clenched Lin Xiao's fist like an iron claw. He could not move an inch despite his best efforts.\"How... How could this be?\"Lin Xiao's expression changed drastically.\"What?\"The spectators widened their eyes in shock. \"How can it be? How can Su Mo block Lin Xiao's punch so easily? Moreover, he is composed while Lin Xiao is bright red in the face.\"\"Is this the full extent of your power? You're just a good-for-nothing, yet you're still so arrogant! How ridiculous!\" Su Mo scoffed.He applied slight pressure with his hand, producing a cracking sound.Ah!Lin Xiao screamed as the stinging pain in his fist caused him to twist his face in agony. Heavy drops of sweat dripped from his cheek.\"How dare you?\" Lin Xiao roared.\"Why wouldn't I dare? People who respect others are also respected, and people who insult others are also insulted. Beat it, you piece of trash!\"Su Mo calmly flung his arm, sending Lin Xiao flying out of the window.The spectators were stood with their mouths agape, thinking \"Su Mo is too insolent!\"\"Is he really a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul?\"\"It seems like the rumors are false!\"\"Su Mo, you wait! I'll make you pay for my humiliation 100 times over!\" Lin Xiao screamed furiously from outside the restaurant.He knew that he was no match for Su Mo and did not want to stay any longer. Thus, he slunk away with his tail between his legs.After taking care of Lin Xiao, Su Mo directed his gaze at Su Heng.Su Heng shivered in fear of the chill emanating from Su Mo. He asked in a shaky voice, \"Su Mo, what... what do you want?\"\"Scram!\" Su Mo spat coldly.Su Heng froze, feeling his face pale with disgrace.However, he was too afraid to say anything else and hastily scurried out of the restaurant.After getting rid of the two men, Su Mo had also lost his interest in eating there.\"Xi'er, let's order a couple of dishes and have the restaurant deliver them home.\"\"Alright.\"Su Mo called the waiter and ordered several dishes to be delivered to the Sus. He then left the restaurant with Xi'er....Su Hong entered the yard just after Su Mo and Xi'er finished eating\"Mo'er!\"\"Father, you're finally out of seclusion!\" Su Mo exclaimed.Su Hong said with a smile, \"Yes, I am!\"He then was instantly stunned when he saw a beautiful girl in the yard.\"Xi'er, this is my father.\" Su Mo introduced his father to Xi'er.\"Greetings, Master.\"She immediately got up and bowed to Su Hong.\"Father, this is Xi'er.\"After Su Mo made the introductions, he told his father about everything that had happened to her village.\"Since Xi'er is willing to follow you, you must take good care of her in the future.\"Su Hong gave Xi'er a careful once-over and secretly gave his approval. The hint of joy in his eyes spoke volumes.Noticing the mirth in his father's eyes, Su Mo rubbed his nose speechlessly. It seemed that his father had gotten the wrong idea.\"Father, have you made a breakthrough in your cultivation?\" asked Su Mo, trying to change the subject.Though he could not sense his father's cultivation, it was easy to guess the answer from his father's happy demeanor.\"That's right! I have!\"Su Hong nodded with a pleased smile. His cultivation had remained stagnant for many years, and a breakthrough made him feel satisfied.Su Mo was also happy for his father. Su Hong had already been an expert in Sunnywood City, but now with his improved cultivation, he had few opponents besides a couple of old men in long-term seclusion.The father and son chatted for a while. Su Hong then asked seriously, \"Mo'er, you'll be fighting Wei Liang in a few days. How confident are you in winning?\"He was still worried. After all, Wei Liang was a genius of the Weis, and his strength should not be underestimated.\"Don't worry, Father! I won't say I have complete confidence in winning, but 80 to 90% odds is fair,\" said Su Mo with a smile.He was not bragging. Though he had only reached the Peak Lv 4 Qi cultivation Realm, his genuine Qi was equivalent to that of Lv 5. Paired with his human body that was equal to Lv 5, he was not much weaker than a master at the Lv 6.Moreover, after cultivating three types of Lv 3 techniques, he now had the ability to contend with a Lv 6 martial artist.Su Mo was also confident that he would be able to break through into the Lv 5 in the next few days.\"Good. Though I don't know where your assurance comes from, I'm relieved as long as you're confident!\"Su Hong nodded and said, \"I still have things to attend to, so I'll take my leave.\"After his father left, Su Mo also prepared to continue his cultivation.\"Xi'er, take these Body Tempering Elixirs. Try your best to reach the peak of the Body Tempering Realm by the end of this year, so you can awaken your Martial Soul next year.\"Su Mo handed Xi'er all the Body Tempering Elixirs he had bought.\"Don't worry, Brother Su Mo. I definitely won't let you down.\"A hint of confidence appeared in Xi'er's eyes. \"When I become powerful, I'll be able to protect you!\"\"Haha! Silly girl, I'll still have to protect you!\"Su Mo laughed heartily, gently pinched her delicate cheeks, and said flirtatiously, \"How soft!\"Eek!Xi'er's face instantly became bright red, and she ran away with a squeal.\"Haha!\"Su Mo burst out laughing and then entered his room to begin his cultivating.He sat cross-legged on the bed and first took out 30 Soul Crystals.\"30 Class 9 Lv 1 Beast Souls should be enough for my Martial Soul to advance to Rank 6 Human Class, right?\"With a smile on his face, Su Mo crushed a Soul Crystal, and an Ox-like Beast Soul immediately floated out of it.He hurriedly released his Martial Soul to devour the Beast Soul.The Devouring Martial Soul trembled lightly before becoming calm again.\"A Class 9 Lv 1 Beast Soul is just as powerful as I expected!\"After devouring the Beast Soul, he felt a massive power being absorbed into his Devouring Martial Soul.It felt much stronger than that of a Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Soul.Su Mo continued devouring the Beast Souls.Five!10!20!25!When he devoured the 28th Beast Soul, his Devouring Martial Soul suddenly shook and emitted a piercing yellow light.A sixth yellow halo appeared over it.Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul!Su Mo smiled brightly and devoured the two remaining Soul Crystals.\"A Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul should be the most highly-ranked one in Sunnywood City! I wonder how powerful it'll be.\"He channeled all his power into his Devouring Martial Soul, and its dark vortex began spinning rapidly.Its rotating speed was now twice as fast as before, collecting all the Spiritual Qi around Su Mo.The majestic Spiritual Qi almost enveloped Su Mo's entire body. The whole room seemed to have transformed into a sea of Spiritual Qi.Su Mo became overjoyed and called on his Martial Soul with all his strength.Massive amounts of Spiritual Qi entered Su Mo's meridians, where he converted them into genuine Qi.The genuine Qi inside his body became incredibly dense. When it came to a breaking point, that was the time when he would break into the Lv 5 Qi cultivation realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Master and elders of the Weis, as well as people from Mansion of City Governor have all come.\"\"Many people from the Sus also come! Their Master and first elder are here, too!\"\"Who do you think will win today's fight to the death?\"\"Who do you think? Of course, Wei Liang will!\"\"I don't think so. I've heard Su Mo is quite strong and even beat up the son of the city governor the other day.\"\"Even so, Su Mo is no match for Wei Liang. I've heard Wei Liang's cultivation has reached the peak Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"\"...\"A simple spectator stand had been set up in the square.The Weis sat on the left. Wei Wankong sat in the middle, with elders flanking him and inferior disciples behind him, including Wei Liang.On the right sat the Sus. Su Hong, the first elder, and some other elders were here, too.Su Heng and the other disciples stood behind them.Besides the Weis and the Sus, many big shots in Sunnywood City sat there, who were here on the Weis' invitation.The Weis wanted everyone in the city to witness a disciple from their family sadistically kill the young master of the Sus.\"Su Hong, why isn't your son here yet? Does he get cold feet?\" Wei Wankong glanced at Su Hong and asked mockingly after noticing Su Mo's absence.\"Humph! Don't worry! Since my son dared to accept the challenge, he'll definitely come!\" Su Hong huffed back coldly.Wei Wankong sneered and thought, \"Gloat on! Let's see how smug you'll be when your son dies!\"\"Su Mo's here!\"Loud cheers came from the outside of the square.The crowd automatically parted to make way for a young man and lady.The young man was carrying a long sword and was very handsome, while the young lady was such a beauty that she drew everyone's attention.They were Su Mo and Xi'er.Everyone thought that they were such a lovely match, but they also lamented that Su Mo would die very soon.Su Mo and Xi'er walked onto the spectators stand toward Su Hong.\"Father.\" Su Mo saluted Su Hong.\"Mo'er, I look forward to your performance,\" said Su Hong with a nod.\"Su Mo, since you're already here, let's not waste any time!\" Wei Wankong sneered as he glanced at Su Mo. He then looked around and loudly said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, today is the voluntary fight to the death between Wei Liang of our family and Su Mo of the Sus. Let Heaven determine their lives! With you all as witnesses, neither family can challenge the outcome afterward!\"\"Let Heaven determine their lives!\"\"Let Heaven determine their lives!\"The crowd was instantly invigorated and cheered.A wide smile appeared on Wei Wankong's\u00a0face. He said all of this, because he believed that Su Mo would undoubtedly die today.However, if Su Hong lost his mind after his son's death and recklessly waged war against the Weis, there would be horrible consequences.Now that he had said this in front of countless citizens of Sunnywood City, Su Hong would have no reason to argue after Su Mo's death.\"Alright. Let's begin!\"Wei Wankong took his seat again and nodded to Wei Liang, who was standing behind him.With a spear in his hand, Wei Liang stepped out and flew to the center of the square.\"Su Mo, come and meet your death!\"Wei Liang glared at Su Mo murderously with his long spear pointing to him.Su Mo glanced at his opponent and turned to Xi'er, saying, \"Xi'er, stay by my father's side.\"He was about to leave and meet Wei Liang's challenge when Xi'er grabbed the hem of his clothes.\"Brother Su Mo!\" Xi'er looked extremely worried.\"Don't worry, Xi'er. I'll be fine,\" said Su Mo while patting her hand to comfort her.Suddenly, a loud voice came from outside of the square.\"Purple Gold Pavilion is starting a handicap. The odds of Wei Liang's victory is one-to-one. The odds of Su Mo's victory is ten-to-one. Hurry up and place your bets!\"Hearing this, many went to place their bets.Most betted on Wei Liang's victory.Su Mo was momentarily speechless and cursed in his head, \"Ten-to-one odds? Purple Gold Pavilion is really looking down on me!\"\"Master, we're going to place some bets as well!\" said the elders of the Sus with malice in their eyes.The First Elder Su Yue, the Fourth Elder Su Tai, and the others wagered a good deal of money on the outcome.Though they were from the Sus, they betted on Wei Liang's victory. How ironic!A few people nearby, who were hesitating, made their decisions when they saw that even the elders of the Sus made such a bet.\"Purple Gold Pavilion will rake in a huge profit this time!\" thought Su Mo with the tempting figure of Luo Huan flashing in his mind.As so many people bet on Wei Liang, Purple Gold Pavilion would earn a fortune if Su Mo won.\"Father, go and bet on me! The money is ours to take!\"With his ten-to-one odds, a bet of 50kg of gold would make a return of 500kg. How could he let such a great opportunity slip out of his hands?\"Alright! I'll bet 100kg of gold on you!\" Su Hong smiled and placed his bet on Su Mo.\"Haha! Since Master Su is so confident, we will definitely match you on that!\"Wei Wankong laughed and wagered a decent amount of money on Wei Liang.The Weis was ecstatic about how easy it would be to make money from this obvious outcome.After everyone placed their bets, Su Mo flew onto the field in a flash and stopped 10 meters away from Wei Liang.The fight was about to start!People fixed their gazes on the field.\"Su Mo, this date next year will be the anniversary of your death.\"Wei Liang sneered. He did not see Su Mo as a worthy opponent at all.\"Really? Wei Liang, I suggest you give this fight your all strength today. Otherwise, you don't even deserve my full effort,\" Su Mo said with a smile.\"How dare you speak so arrogantly!\" Wei Liang angrily shouted and said, \"I hope you won't kneel down and beg for mercy later, but even if you do that, I still won't let you live.\"\"Are you done with your nonsense? Hurry up and attack! I don't have all day,\" Su Mo said calmly with a relaxed expression.\"Die for your arrogance!\"Wei Liang was completely enraged with genuine Qi spreading all over his body and turning into a fierce sweeping wind....Su Yu and Liu Yushan stood closely together among the crowd of spectators, watching the two fighters on the field.\"Yushan, I didn't want to come, but you insisted. What's so interesting about a predictable fight?\" Su Yu shrugged and said flatly.\"Though his talent is too poor to deserve me, he's still my cousin and was very kind to me in my childhood. He's fighting to the death today, so I have to come.\" Liu Yushan sighed.She still harbored feelings for Su Mo, but those feelings meant nothing in the face of martial arts. Thus, she had abandoned them without hesitation.\"Wei Liang's cultivation is at the Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm. Even I can't defeat him easily, not to mention that failure, Su Mo!\"Su Yu pursed his lips and said with certainty, \"For some reason, Su Mo's strength has greatly improved recently, but at most, he's at the Lv 4. He'll be killed by Wei Liang with one move...\"Before Su Yu could finish speaking, his face froze.Su Mo had completely released his breath at the Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Even if he's at the Lv 5, he'll still be defeated eventually.\" Su Yu scoffed with an unpleasant look on his face.As the top genius in the Sus, he had just reached the Lv 6 with the help of plenty of resources from the family.How did Su Mo with his rubbish Martial Soul reach the Lv 5 so unexpectedly?How did he cultivate this?Su Yu could not understand this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His Lv 5 cultivation was fully exposed for everyone to see.That was right. He had successfully broken the Lv 4 bottleneck and entered the Lv 5 two days ago.With his cultivation breakthrough, his strength had naturally increased as well. He now possessed complete confidence in his victory today.He would show everyone how he, the so-called piece of trash, would turn this battle around.\"Damn! Su Mo actually has the Lv 5 cultivation!\"\"Didn't they say his Martial Soul is only at the Rank 1 Human Class? How does he have such a high cultivation?\"\"It looks like all the rumors are fake! The Sus must have lied to us!\"When everyone realized what Su Mo's true cultivation was, they\u00a0started raising a commotion and chatted among themselves furiously.Unless there was a large disparity in the cultivation, a martial artist couldn't hide his cultivation by obscuring his aura.Moreover, martial artists who cultivated low-level cultivation skills would find it hard to determine the cultivation of those who practiced high-level ones.Su Mo cultivated Lv 3 cultivation skills, and he had never shown off his level, so no one knew his true cultivation.On the spectator stand, the Weis was also surprised to see Su Mo's cultivation, but not by much.The Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm?It still was not good enough!Unlike the composed Weis, the Sus were all gripped with shock.They knew that Su Mo's Martial Soul was indeed at Rank 1 Human Class. They had seen it with their own eyes, so it could not be a mistake.Logically, it was not possible for a person with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul to achieve an Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm even within five to six years.How long had it been since Su Mo awakened his Martial Soul?It was less than two months!Su Yue, the first elder, grew sullen, but a sneer soon appeared on his face. He thought that Su Hong must have bought a bunch of elixirs to forcibly increase Su Mo's cultivation.Otherwise, Su Mo\u00a0would not have had such a cultivation at all.A couple weeks ago, Su Hong had even taken 500kg of gold from their treasury.Since then, the First Elder began controlling the Sus' finances with an iron fist. He ruled that even the Master could not withdraw so much money at will without the elders' approval.If Su Hong wanted to train Su Mo, he had to use his own money.The Sus would not waste their money and resources on training a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.Su Hong glanced at the elders beside him and took in their expressions. A cold smile appeared on his face.He naturally knew what they were thinking, but he did not want to say anything.In the middle of the square, Wei Liang raised his eyebrow at the raging Su Mo and laughed. \"You have an Lv 5 cultivation. No wonder you're so arrogant. However, do you really think that's enough to beat me?\"\"Are you spouting all this nonsense to flaunt your superiority?\" Su Mo asked impatiently.\"Humph! Since you want to die, I'll help you!\" Wei Liang snorted and brandished his spear, hurling it at Su Mo's chest.Like a dragon emerging from the sea, his silver spear moved with a harsh screech as it pierced toward Su Mo.\"It's pretty powerful, but sadly, it's too slow!\"Su Mo shook his head and dodged the spear, leaving only a residual shadow where he had just stood.Wei Liang's pupils shrunk in surprise, thinking, \"How fast!\"\"Su Mo, you can't defeat me just by relying on your speed.\"Operating the genuine Qi inside him, Wei Liang suddenly stomped on the ground. He flew out like a sharp arrow and pounced on Su Mo like a rain of 1,000 spears.His spear suddenly transformed into countless shadows, completely enveloping Su Mo.\"Let's see how you'll dodge this time,\" Wei Liang said with a sneer.Rip! Rip! Rip!The white shadow of the spear pierced the air and stacked on each other tier upon tier, completely trapping Su Mo in.\"Not bad, but I'll still break them!\"Instead of drawing his sword, Su Mo launched punch after punch, and his powerful fist force eventually broke through the shadow that covered the sky.Boom! Boom!The bursting sound of the air continued to ring loud and clear, sending sand and pebbles everywhere.\"Impossible! I've only used 70 or 80 percent of my strength, but it still shouldn't be easily broken by an Lv 5 martial artist!\"Wei Liang's expression changed, and he began to get serious.What he did not know was that Su Mo's Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist had reached the Great Completion Realm, and his physical strength was also very strong.\"Once again! Meteor Spearplay!\"This time, Wei Liang put all his strength into his attack.The dazzling spear radiance grazed the sky, as if meteors were falling.\"That's the Meteor Spearplay of the Weis! Su Mo's going to lose!\"\"I've heard that Meteor Spearplay is an Upper Lv 1 martial art technique and has incredible power. I didn't expect Wei Liang to practice this technique!\"\"I think Su Mo will be killed with a single strike.\"Everyone started exclaiming as they watched the radiance speeding past them. It was so fast that there was no way to dodge it, so it had to be met head-on.On the spectators stand, Su Hong and Xi'er nervously kept their eyes trained on the arena.Meanwhile, the Weis all smiled.It was over for Su Mo!Just then, an indifferent voice rang from the middle of the square.\"Not bad. You're worthy enough for me to draw my sword!\"Su Mo's expression was calm as he unsheathed his long sword. The white radiance shone as he wielded the sword at a greater speed than Wei Liang's spear.In all honesty, Su Mo could avoid that attack if he dodged with all his effort, but Wei Liang had roused his fighting spirit.Therefore, he decided to draw his sword.Boom!The point of sword hit the point of spear. Boom! The sword Qi was everywhere and the spear light flashed.Both men were forced backward.\"What? Su Mo actually fought off this move!\"\"Unbelievable! Su Mo's realm is one rank lower than Wei Liang's, but he can compete with him!\"\"...\"The crowd outside the square instantly erupted with endless chatter.\"Interesting! There's actually someone with the strength to fight beyond his rank in this remote town!\"Outside the square, a charming figure stood behind the crowd and watched the fight from a distance.She wore a veil covering her face, but judged from her enchanting figure, she must be a stunning beauty.She was the leader of Purple Gold Pavilion, Luo Huan.She had been here the whole time, watching the fight silently.She was rather curious about Su Mo.In the middle of the square, Wei Liang's expression was very ugly. He felt embarrassed after failing to defeat Su Mo after so many moves.Wei Liang felt very embarrassed, because he did not defeat Su Mo after a series of strikes.\"Su Mo, I'll admit you're pretty good, but it's impossible for you to win today!\" Wei Liang shouted.\"Really? I've already taken three of your moves. Why don't you take three of mine?\" Su Mo smiled without responding to Wei Liang's statement.\"Humph! Never mind three strikes. I can take hundreds of strikes from you. Bring them on!\"Wei Liang's tone was disdainful, but his expression was grim.Su Mo's strength was far beyond his expectations. He had completely stopped underestimating Su Mo.Su Mo smiled gently and suddenly charged at Wei Liang at an incredible speed.Whoosh!The long sword in his hand seemed to be dancing, flashing with a liquid sword radiance before suddenly disappearing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His arms went numb, and he was forced to stumble back.Su Mo's blood was boiling, and Qi blood was pouring profusely from him. His first strike did not hit its target, so he swung his force again with powerful genuine Qi and physical force.\"Gale Blade!\"The sword ray glinted and pierced the air, and its shadow swept toward Wei Liang's head.Huff!Wei Liang shouted and waved his spear, forming a shield against Su Mo's sword.Boom!The long sword swung down violently, and its immense force sent Wei Liang flying back a dozen meters.\"How could it be? How could you be this powerful?\" Wei Liang roared in shock.His hands were fractured, and his entire arm was completely numb. He could barely hold the spear in his hand.His blood was also boiling with Qi blood rising up his throat, but he forced it back down.\"Nothing is impossible! Those were two of my moves, and here's another one.\" Su Mo said coldly and immediately attacked again, leaving Wei Liang no time for recovery.Blast through Stray Clouds!Pew!The sword radiance glinted, and all the surrounding airflow immediately began to rumble. Suddenly, a cyclone appeared, tearing up all its surroundings and heading straight towards Wei Liang.\"Howl!\" Wei Liang roared as a fear of imminent death arose in him, and a seven-foot-long spear appeared on his back surrounded by yellow light.Wei Liang's Martial Soul with four yellow halos was also a long spear, and it meshed well with the weapons he used.Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!\"Starlight Illuminating the Earth!\"This time, Wei Liang did not simply defend himself. Instead, he used his Martial Soul and all the genuine Qi in his body to enact his strongest move to counter Su Mo's attack.After he released his Martial Soul, Wei Liang's power increased at least by half.The spear rattled and tore through the air to meet the approaching attack.Boom!The fierce attacks violently crashed into each other.Poof!A stream of blood shot into the air. Wei Liang's body flew back like a limp sack and fell to the ground.Silence!Everything surrounding them was dead silent.All the spectators were completely dumbfounded and could not believe their eyes. The result was way beyond their expectation.Su Mo had gained a crushing victory over Wei Liang!Wei Liang was defenseless against Su Mo!After a moment of silence, the entire square erupted with deafening noise.\"My God, Wei Liang actually lost!\"\"Is this Su Mo's actual power?\"\"What kind of Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul could do that? The Sus have been lying to us!\"\"Tsk tsk, it's so impressive that he's that powerful with only an Lv 5 cultivation!\"\"...\"The chaotic chatter went on for a long time.On the spectators stand even Su Hong seemed stunned. Even though he believed in his son, he was still surprised by Su Mo's strength.Unlike the shocked Su Hong, Xi'er was smiling joyfully.Su Mo had a special place in her heart, and her impression of him was merging with the dashing hero she met two weeks ago.Back then, when Xi'er was kidnapped by bandits, she had already given up her will to live. If those bandits had tried to tarnish her chastity, she would have immediately killed herself.However, at that moment, a handsome young man had come out of nowhere, rescued her, and avenged her.She vowed to follow Su Mo not only because she wanted to become stronger, but also out of her thankfulness and idolization toward him.In the Weis' camp, every member of the Weis was stone-faced, especially Wei Wankong, who was sulking and secretly cursing Wei Liang for being a failure.In a 30 meter-high tower with 300 meters from the square, a well-dressed handsome young man watched the square from afar with a sour look on his face.He huffed coldly and turned away.This young man was Lin Xiao.On the square, Wei Liang stood up pathetically and could not help but spit out another mouthful of blood.\"This can't be possible!\"His eyes were filled with shock, and he could not accept his loss.\"Ha! Wei Liang, didn't you want to kill me?\" Su Mo asked with a mocking smile.\"You...!\"Wei Liang's face contorted, and he roared with a crazed look in his eyes. \"I haven't lost, and you'll still die today!\"He suddenly took out a black medicinal pill from his pocket and swallowed it.Boom!After swallowing the pill, Wei Liang's body noticeably shriveled.At the same time, the breath in his body dramatically increased. In a matter of seconds, he reached an equivalent of Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"It's a Seething Blood Pill!\"\"My God, Wei Liang ate a Seething Blood Pill!\" The crowd immediately exclaimed.The Seething Blood Pill was an extremely potent elixir that caused a martial artist's blood to erupt and their body to dry up in 15 minutes.The benefit was that during this time span, this person's strength would greatly increase.Of course, the cost was that the person would die of blood loss as the time passed.However, if the martial artist stopped the effects of the pill earlier, he could survive, but this would prevent him from pursuing martial arts in the future.\"Stop it!\" Su Hong stood up in the spectators stand and yelled angrily at the Weis. \"Wei Wankong, how dare your disciple to use the Seething Blood Pill in an official match! This battle is canceled.\"Wei Wankong was stunned, but then his sulking expression turned into a smile.He had not expected Wei Liang to take a Seething Blood Pill, either.However, since he had already taken it, this battle could turn in his favor.\"Su Hong! You've never said that medicinal pills couldn't be used before the battle began.\" Wei Wankong chuckled and continued, \"We've agreed before that the results of this battle and their lives would be decided by fate. Are you going back on your word?\"\"You...\" Su Hong shouted angrily, \"This battle is no longer fair. I object to it.\"He then yelled into the arena, \"Mo'er, this battle is over! You can come back!\"After he took the Seething Blood Pill, Wei Liang's cultivation was equivalent to Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm. Su Hong was not willing to watch his son be killed.In the arena, Su Mo heard his father's call but did not move.He coldly glanced at Wei Liang and said to Su Hong, \"Father, I don't see any issue in testing his current abilities!\"Su Mo's eyes surged with fighting desire, and his blood boiled.\"Seething Blood Pill?\"\"Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm?\"\"Who knows who's going to win or lose!\"\"Mo'er...\" Su Hong was extremely worried.\"Father, don't worry! I know what I'm doing.\"Su Hong sighed and nodded in defeat while secretly preparing to save Su Mo if his life was in danger.\"Great, he's indeed quite brave. Su Hong, since your son wants to keep fighting, let's continue!\" Wei Wankong laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I've underestimated you.\" A cold light gleamed in Wei Liang's eyes as he continued, \"Now, you no longer stand a chance.\"\"Do you really think you're definitely going to win?\" Su Mo asked calmly.\"Is that not the case?\"\"How about this, Wei Liang? Let's not waste each other's time and settle this in one move!\"Su Mo's eyes blazed with fighting desire.\"Alright, ending this match quickly is exactly what I wanted.\" Wei Liang roared, and the genuine Qi in his body increased infinitely and all poured into his spear. The spear shook and emitted a blinding light.Su Mo's face was solemn, and, like his opponent, he put aside his mocking attitude.He twirled his long sword, which was surging with Primordial Genuine Qi. The sword radiance grew much brighter.At that moment, Su Mo's mind was as still as water and only focused on his burning desire to kill.Everyone held their breath and kept their eyes glued to the arena.It was finally the deciding moment!\"Starlight Illuminating the Earth!\"Wei Liang attacked first with his usual strongest move, but this move was far more powerful than before. His spear turned into a raging dragon that crazily shot toward Su Mo.Suddenly, everything came to a standstill, and all that was left was the blinding light of the spear.Whoosh!Su Mo threw his body forward and lept into the air.An unparalleled sword radiance pierced the air so violently that it seemed to break the restraints of space and time.Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!This was the last and most fatal move of Divine Wind Swordplay.This move was overpowering, sharp, strange, and ethereal.This move shocked all of the Sus and the Weis!This move shocked all of the spectators!Su Mo's swordsmanship did not belong to the Sus'. They had never seen such powerful and sharp swordplay.Wei Liang felt the menace of this attack more than anyone, but both men had made their moves, so there was no going back.Wei Liang could only howl and increase his genuine Qi to make his attack 30 percent more powerful.Boom!Amidst everyone's shock, the two attacks violently crashed into each other and exploded like meteors hitting the earth.Boom!The air streams from the explosion shattered the ground and sent debris flying everywhere.Su Mo and Wei Liang's silhouettes were enveloped in a layer of smoke. No one from the outside could tell what was going on.On the spectators stand, everyone got up from their seats and fixed their gazes on the square.\"Who won?\" This was the question burning in everyone's minds.The smoke dissipated after a while, revealing Su Mo and Wei Liang standing five feet away from each other.Everyone stared with wide eyes.Everything was dead silent.Pfft!At this moment, they heard a slight noise.In the middle of the square, Su Mo's body shook, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.\"What?\"\"Su Mo has lost?\"\"At the end of the day, the powerful Su Mo has still been defeated!\"The spectators were shocked, but they soon realized that no matter how powerful Su Mo was, the gap between their cultivations was too great to overcome.Just as this idea popped into their minds, they met with a surprise.Clunk!The spear in Wei Liang's hand dropped to the ground with an echoing sound.Amidst everyone's stunned stares, Wei Liang's tall figure came crashing down and sent up a cloud of dust.Upon closer inspection, everyone saw a terrifying sword wound on Wei Liang's body.The gash extended from his neck to his abdomen, practically slicing him in two.However, since the Seething Blood Pill had almost dried up all of his blood, he was not bleeding much.Hiss!Gasps were heard everywhere among the crowd.\"So Wei Liang actually lost!\"Everyone looked at Su Mo in awe.This martial artist with a Lv 5 cultivation was able to kill Wei Liang, who was at Lv 7.Nothing like this had ever happened in the history of Yunyang City.Who was a genius?Su Mo was a true genius!The entire square erupted with thunderous noises, including the adoring screams of young women.\"Haha! Great! Great!\" On the stand, Su Hong was beaming and could not contain his laughter. His son never failed to surprise him.One person's joy was another's sorrow. Unlike the overjoyed Su Hong, Wei Wankong was stone-faced. This time, not only was he unable to avenge his son, he also lost a genius disciple.He wanted to scream in rage, but he was too prideful to do so.He himself had said in front of everyone that it would be a fight to the death.In the end, he could only scoff and order for Wei Wankong's body to be collected. He then pathetically left in defeat along with the members of his family.\"Mo'er, how are you doing? Are you badly hurt?\" Su Hong asked with concern as he approached Su Mo.\"Haha! Father, I'm fine! It's just a scratch.\" Su Mo shook his head with a smile. He was telling the truth. He only suffered some trauma to his abdomen, which would heal in a couple of days.This was due to Su Mo's physical strength. Elephant's Strength Skill not only made him powerful but also greatly improved his physical resilience.Otherwise, even if he was not killed by this blow, he would still be severely injured.\"Alright, since this battle is over, let's go home!\" said Su Hong.\"Brother Su Mo, let me help you walk,\" said Xi'er while rushing to put her arm around him.\"Xi'er, it's just a minor injury.\"\"You spit up blood! How is that a minor injury?\" Xi'er shook her head and insisted on helping him.Su Mo smiled helplessly. Next to Xi'er, he could smell the faint fragrance of her body, and he was instantly captivated.Subsequently, he accompanied his father to collect the winner's prize and returned home.Having betted 100 kg of gold, Su Hong walked away with a whopping 1,000 kg of gold.Aside from him, everyone else had lost their bets and were all wailing in despair!The First Elder and other members of the Sus had all lost their bets and were extremely displeased.Prior to the match, they were certain that Su Mo would lose, so they had bet heavily against him.Now, they had lost all their money.As the crowd slowly thinned out, Su Yu and Liu Yushan stood outside the square in shock.Liu Yushan's emotions were complicated. She had always believed that Su Mo was not good enough for her, but his performance today proved her wrong.A faint feeling of regret stirred in her heart.\"He only has a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul. Even if he's strong now, it's only temporary. He can't go far in martial arts!\" said Su Yu.His words gradually calmed her down....\"Xi'er, wasn't I cool?\" asked Su Mo shamelessly on their way home.\"Very cool!\" said the girl shyly with a faint blush spreading on her face.\"Did you fall in love with me?\" Su Mo was in a great mood and teased her mischievously.Xi'er was instantly embarrassed and practically buried her flushed face in the ground.\"Haha!\" Su Mo burst out laughing.After they returned to the Sus, his father gave him healing elixirs.Su Mo began to heal in seclusion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ever since his fight with Wei Liang a month ago, he had gained a deeper understanding of Divine Wind Swordplay.Actual battles were the best way to practice.Lately, he had been coming here every morning to practice his swordplay.Divine Wind Swordplay had four movements. Two weeks ago, he had reached the Minor Completion Realm of the first three, and two days ago, he had reached the Minor Completion of the last one, boosting his strength tremendously.Su Mo did not neglect his cultivation over the course of the month, which had steadily increased to the Peak Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm.His Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul cultivated extremely quickly, so he spent most of his time cultivating his physical body.His cultivation of Elephant's Strength Skill had reached the late stage of Lv 2, making his body as strong as six tigers and equivalent to a Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm martial artist.If he had fought Wei Liang with his current strength, Su Mo would have been able to instantly kill him with one move.Nearby, Xi'er sat on a smooth boulder, resting her cheeks on her hands. She wore a snow-white dress with a blue jade pendant.\"Xi'er, do you want to learn this swordplay?\" asked Su Mo with a grin, having finished practicing.\"Haha! Brother Su Mo, I'm very dumb. I don't know if I can learn such profound swordplay,\" Xi'er said with a smile.\"Who said you're dumb? Xi'er is smarter than everyone else.\" Su Mo smiled and then seriously said, \"Xi'er, you've reached the Lv 8 of the Body Tempering Realm, right? Soon, when you complete it and awaken your Martial Soul, I'll teach you how to practice swordplay.\"The Body Tempering Realm toughened one's body, so it would be strong enough to awaken a Martial Soul.\"Uh-huh!\" Xi'er nodded.\"Also, I always see you wearing this jade pendant and staring at it. Is there a story to it?\" Su Mo asked, sitting down next to her and looking at her pendant.\"Of course, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I'm just asking.\" Su Mo hastily added when he saw her smile had disappeared.\"Brother Su Mo, this jade pendant is related to my birth story.\"She took off her jade pendant and gently said, \"When grandpa found me back then, I was still a baby. The only thing he found on me was this jade pendant. Perhaps, this jade pendant is the only thing related to my real identity.\"Su Mo took the jade pendant from her and studied it carefully.The sea-blue jade pendant was the size of a child's palm and had the word \"Xuan\" carved on the back. This script was extremely elegant and gave off a powerful aura.Su Mo could tell that this was no ordinary pendant.\"Xi'er, if I ever get the chance, I'll definitely help you find your birth parents,\" Su Mo seriously said after handing her the pendant.\"That's alright, Brother Su Mo. I'm very happy with my life, and I feel lucky to be able to watch you practice swordplay every day.\" Xi'er smiled.\"Haha! You silly girl!\" Su Mo gently rubbed her head.\"Let's go home, Xi'er!\" Su Mo walked back to the Sus with her....After returning, Su Mo went to the Sus' martial practice field.The clan had an announcement to make today about the clan meeting.A lot of disciples already gathered in the martial practice field. Many of them greeted Su Mo when they saw him.\"Hello, Cousin Su Mo!\"\"Hello, Brother Su Mo!\"After Su Mo proved his strength to everyone in the fight last month, no one dared to call him a piece of trash anymore.Of course, a majority of them still wanted nothing to do with him.These people, including Su Heng and Su Yu, believed that Su Mo's powerful strength was temporary, and his accomplishments would nevertheless be limited due to his low-level Martial Soul.Su Yu was also on the martial practice field. He glanced at Su Mo as he approached from a distance but quickly looked away.Though the fight last month had shocked him, he still looked down on Su Mo.With a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, Su Mo would never be able to catch up with him.A group had gathered around Su Yu, chattering about something excitedly.\"Brother Su Yu, I've heard that Brother Tianhao and Su Hai have returned from the Sky Yuan Sect.\"\"Yes! I've heard both of them reached Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. They're really terrifying!\"\"Haha! Brother Su Yu's Martial Soul is of a higher level than theirs. It won't be long before you enter the Sky Yuan Sect and surpass them.\"\"Are Su Tianhao and Su Hai back?\"Su Mo overheard their conversation from afar and raised his eyebrows.Su Tianhao and Su Hai were respectively the sons of the third and fourth elders. They were the strongest among the young Su disciples.Last year, they left the Sus at the age of 18 to join the Sky Yuan Sect, one of the four sects of Skymoon Country.No one expected they would reach Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm in just one year.Just then, the crowd stirred.\"Here comes Brother Tianhao and Brother Su Hai!\"Su Mo turned his head and saw two young men slowly walking over.Their aura was extremely powerful and greatly surpassed everyone else's.Su Tianhao was tall and slim, wearing a yellow robe and a stern expression.The other stocky man dressed completely in black was Su Hai.\"Brother Tianhao!\"\"Brother Su Hai!\"Just as the two reached the martial practice field, a group of young disciples crowded around them with adoring expressions.\"Brother Tianhao, Brother Su Hai, can you tell us what the Sky Yuan Sect is like?\"\"Yes, yes! I've heard that the Sky Yuan Sect is brimming with masters and geniuses. Is that true?\"\"...\"The crowd fired one question after another about the Sky Yuan Sect.Su Tianhao looked prideful and showed no interest in answering their questions.On the contrary, Su Hai was full of smiles and answered. \"You're right. The Sky Yuan Sect has 5,000 disciples, and each of them is a genius.\"That's not all. The sect has all kinds of powerful cultivation skills and martial arts techniques, as well as countless miraculous pills.Each month, we receive all kinds of resources, and our cultivation improves by strides.I'm so valued in the sect that I've heard some elders want me as their disciple!\"\"...\"The more Su Hai blabbered on, the more excited and exaggerated he became, spewing spittle all over the place.However, all the surrounding disciples were mesmerized and envious. Even Su Yu was entranced by the stories.Su Mo's lip curled. Though he was not familiar with the Sky Yuan Sect, he knew that Su Hai was bragging.As one of the four sects in Skymoon Country, it made sense that every disciple was a genius there.However, Su Hai's Martial Soul was only at Lv 4, which probably placed him in the bottom tier of the sect. How could he receive so much attention and be selected as a disciple by elders?He was just talking crap!Su Hai loftily raised his head and smugly took in everyone's jealous stares.He greatly enjoyed the feeling of being envied.Just then, Su Hai noticed Su Mo's unimpressed expression out of the corner of his eye and instantly became enraged.\"Haha! Su Mo, I've heard your strength is equivalent to Lv7 Qi Cultivation Realm, and you killed Wei Liang last month,\" he said with a smirk.Su Mo did not reply.Su Hai then abruptly changed his tone and scoffed. \"However, with your strength, you're nothing to me!I know you only have a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul. You'll never reach the Peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, never mind entering the Sky Yuan Sect.\"Su Mo frowned. What was wrong with this guy? He had done nothing to deserve his ridicule!\"Whether or not I'm capable of entering the Sky Yuan Sect is none of your business,\" he said flatly.\"Humph! You're just a powerless nobody!\" Su Hai coldly scoffed, and then he turned to Su Yu with a smile. \"Su Yu, I've heard you have a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul. Not bad. At the end of this year, you can take the sect's entrance exam. It won't be a problem for you.Of course, all members with Rank 4 Human Class Martial Souls can take the exam, but that rank is the minimum requirement for entry, so it'll be hard to pass the exam. Back then, Brother Tianhao and I had exerted great effort to pass it.\"\"Haha! Next year, I'll definitely enter the Sky Yuan Sect.\" Su Yu smiled confidently and glanced at Su Mo with mocking eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, he sat down to meditate.After a while, Su Hong arrived on the martial practice field with the elders.\"Please be quiet, everyone. May I have your attention?\"Su Hong held his hand up to silence everyone.\"Our yearly family martial arts competition will be held in 10 days.\" When the crowd grew quiet, Su Hong continued, \"However, unlike those in the past, the elimination match has been changed to a challenge match. The winner will be able to enter the Sunnywood City Martial Arts Competition.The City Martial Arts Competition is a joint competition between our family, the Weis, and the City Governor's Mansion. Each family will send 10 superior disciples to attend this competition, and our three families will grant large rewards to those who perform well in the competition.The 10 disciples from our family will be selected from the challenge match. Before the match begins, we'll select 10 seeded disciples. Other disciples can challenge them, and if they defeat the seeded disciples, they can replace them.\"Su Hong explained the family competition and the Sunnywood City competition carefully.\"Who are the 10 seeded disciples?\" someone asked.\"We'll discuss this soon,\" the First Elder said.He looked around and continued, \"Su Tianhao and Su Hai, you're both outstanding among our inferior disciples, so both of you are definitely seeded disciples. Yu'er, you should also work hard. You have the highest Martial Soul among the Sus, and you're the first genius of our family, so live up to your title. In this competition, you three are critical to our family's victory. You must win glory for our clan.\"The others all nodded and did not doubt his words. They all believed that these three were the main talents of the Sus.Su Yu and Su Hai looked extremely arrogant.Su Tianhao maintained a stony expression. He was the most powerful among all the young disciples, so he did not care about this level of competition.\"Alright, you may now be dismissed. Be industrious in your cultivating,\" said Su Hong, waving his hands.When the disciples left, Su Hong found Su Mo and said, \"Mo'er, you'll be one of the seeded disciples.\"\"Haha, Father, I'm actually not that interested in the martial arts competition,\" Su Mo said with a chuckle.\"Mo'er, this martial arts competition will offer generous prizes, and the City Governor's Mansion is even gifting the winner an Energy-boosting Elixir. Other rankings will have big rewards as well,\" Su Hong said.\"Oh, Energy-boosting Elixir!\" Su Mo's eyes instantly lit up.The Energy-boosting Elixir was an Upper Lv 1 elixir. It was very precious for martial artists between Lv 7 and Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, because it could save them three months' worth of cultivation.Additionally, martial artists below Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm could use it to break through their realms.\"Both the Weis and the City Governor's Mansion have powerful disciples who have cultivated in Sects. I don't expect you to enter the top three. I'll be very satisfied if you enter the top 10.\"Su Hong did not want to give him too much pressure. After all, he knew that Su Mo had only cultivated for a short time and was weaker than the disciples in Sects.\"Haha, father, don't worry. I'll try my best to rank high.\" Su Mo smiled, his eyes twinkling.\"Only top 10? My father has such low expectations for me!\"\"Good.\" Su Hong patted him on the shoulder with relief.After going back to his room, Su Mo sat down cross-legged and started to cultivate.He had to cultivate harder if he wanted to win the martial arts competition.That was right. He wanted to win!Either he did not compete, or he would aim to be the champion.He sat cross-legged with closed eyes. The three-meter-high Devouring Martial Soul suspended behind him and crazily sucked in aura from heaven and earth.When his Devouring Martial Soul had just awakened, it was only one and a half meters high, but now, as its level progressed, it was three meters high.The Devouring Martial Soul rotated and emitted an invisible suction to devour all the surrounding Spiritual Qi.Su Mo used the Lv 2 cultivation skill of Elephant's Strength Skill. His giant mass of Spiritual Qi became elephant-shaped runes, which continuously entered his body.His body felt a little numb, which meant it was being increasingly reinforced.Lvs 1 to 3 of Elephant's Strength Skill mainly enhanced his strength and fortified his body.His cultivation of Elephant's Strength Skill had reached the late stage of Lv 2, which gave his body the strength of six tigers.With his cultivation speed, it would take at most a couple of days to complete Lv 2 and begin cultivating Lv 3.Elephant's Strength Skill could refine Spiritual Qi at a formidable speed and could absorb any amount of it at an alarming speed.His Martial Soul at Rank 6 Human Class still could not absorb Spiritual Qi as quickly as his body.Time trickled by slowly.Three days later, Su Mo felt that his body was saturated with Blood Qi and could not absorb the elephant-shaped runes anymore.He opened his eyes and stopped cultivating.He had completed Lv 2 of Elephant's Strength Skill.Next, he needed to cultivate Lv 3 cultivation skill.However, in order to speed up his cultivation, he decided to go on a trip.Sunnywood City's martial arts competition would be held soon, so he decided to go back to Breezewind Mountain to increase his strength.There, he could kill as many beasts as he wanted and devour their Beast Souls, essence, and blood.Stepping out of his room, he saw Xi'er practicing her punches in the yard.She was cultivating the Body Tempering Fist. She waved her fists, shouting with determination.Her pretty face was glistening with beads of sweat.\"Xi'er, I'm going to Breezewind Mountain to hunt demonic beasts. I'll be back tomorrow,\" he said to her.\"Brother Su Mo, I want to go, too. Please take me!\" Xi'er stopped cultivating and looked at him excitedly.\"Alright! Let's go!\" After considering this for a while, Su Mo nodded.Although the mountain was dangerous, he could protect her as long as they did not go too deep into the mountain.They left Sunnywood City for Breezewind Mountain immediately....In a quiet yard in the City Governor's Mansion sat a handsome young man who wore a silk robe.He was holding a flirtatious maiden in blue in his arms, kneading her hip and sizeable breasts.He was Lin Xiao, the son of the city governor.Just then, a voice said from outside of the yard, \"Young master, I have something to report.\"Lin Xiao frowned but did not let go of the maiden. He shouted, \"Come on in!\"Immediately, a tall middle-aged guard walked in and bowed to him.\"Young master, Su Mo left town!\" he said.\"Hmm? With whom?\" Lin Xiao asked excitedly, and his eyes lit up.\"It is just him and Lady Xi'er.\" The guard replied.\"Excellent! I'm in luck! Take several people with you to kill him and steal Lady Xi'er back.\" Lin Xiao was overjoyed and added hurriedly, \"Remember, you can't hurt her. Send her to my room at night.\"\"Yes, sir!\" The guard said before leaving.Lin Xiao's face was full of excitement. Since he saw Xi'er last time, he had not been able to get her beautiful figure out of his mind.He had been tirelessly thinking about how he could make her his woman.Therefore, he had dispatched someone to keep an eye on Su Mo and her.Now, to his joy, his dream was about to come true.As soon as he imagined her dainty face and the charming figure lying under his body, Lin Xiao began to blush furiously.Suddenly, he lost all interest in the beautiful maiden in his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That's why it looks like this now.\" Su Mo admitted truthfully.\"Devoured?\"Xi'er was even more confused, for she did not understand how it could be done.\"Haha, Xi'er, if you want to how, I'll show you later,\" Su Mo said with a smile.Xi'er only shook her head and said, \"Since you don't want me to see it, then I won't. Let's go, Brother Su Mo!\"Most of the demonic beasts in the outskirts of the mountain were below Class 3 Lv 1.Since Xi'er slowed him down, Su Mo killed every demonic beast they encountered and devoured their Beast Souls, essence, and blood.Xi'er closed her eyes every time Su Mo killed a demonic beast, despite her curiosity.Although Su Mo allowed her to watch, she insisted against it.Because Su Mo did not want her to see, she would not do so.Su Mo could only shake his head helplessly at her stubbornness.Boom!He killed a Class 3 Lv 1 demonic beast again.Just when he was about to devour it, he suddenly sensed something and turned around.Swish! Swish! Swish!Seven or eight men in black suddenly jumped out of the woods behind them and quickly surrounded Su Mo and Xi'er.\"What do you want?\" Su Mo asked with a frown, hastily pulling Xi'er behind him and giving them a once-over.The men held steel broadswords, and their dense aura indicated that they were all masters. They surrounded Su Mo and Xi'er without saying a word and obviously had bad intentions.\"Su Mo, give us the girl, and I might consider letting you live.\"The leader of this group was a tall and strong middle-aged man with a cold face and eyes full of killing desire.Su Mo arched his brows after hearing that.\"They're here for Xi'er, and they know my identity. It seems they came prepared,\" Su Mo thought.\"Who are you?\" Su Mo snapped at them.\"A dying man has no business knowing.\" The middle-aged man sneered, and then he waved his hands and shouted, \"Kill him!\"He was obviously unwilling to waste his time, so he gave a prompt order.Whoosh! Whoosh!The others waved their long sabers and sprang toward Su Mo.These people had a very powerful aura and were all at Lv 7.If combined, they could even rival someone at Lv 8.Swish!Su Mo quickly pulled Xi'er away, and they dodged the sabers, leaving only a shadow where they had just stood.\"Xi'er, get on my back and hold tight!\" Su Mo pulled her onto his back.Although they were all at Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, it was impossible for them to kill him.Su Mo was only slightly threatened by the leader, who seemed to be at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, far more powerful than the others.If he were fighting a master at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm one-on-one, he would definitely be able to slip away easily if he could not win.However, protecting Xi'er was his top priority.Xi'er also understood the severity of the situation, so she obediently climbed onto Su Mo's back.Su Mo felt the softness and fragrance of her body, but before he could enjoy it, a long saber hit toward him.\"Whoosh!\"Su Mo used his body move to dodge to the side of a man in black.Clash!After a long sword came out of its sheath, with a flash of sword radiance, a stream of blood sprayed out.Killed in one move!Su Mo stepped back rapidly after the kill.\"What?\"The men in black were so astonished that he could kill someone in such a short time.\"He's so fast!\" the leader said in shock.Just a month ago, Su Mo's strength was rarely equivalent to the Lv 7, but now, he could instantly kill a Lv 7 martial artist.\"You're still going to hell today!\" the leader roared, pulling out his revolving saber and hacking toward Su Mo.\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\"He hacked three times in a row, and three sharp gusts of sword Qi went zig-zagging toward Su Mo.The saber Qi blocked Su Mo from dodging, so he had to face it directly.\"Gale Blade!\"Su Mo swung his sword with the power of surging winds. Soon, the sword radiance burst out and cut the saber Qi in front of him.Boom!The saber Qi was shattered and turned into a fierce wind that swept around.Uh!Suddenly, a muffled groan escaped from Xi'er's lips.Su Mo turned back and found Xi's face was pale as white paper. She was biting her lips so hard to hold her moans back.Su Mo was shocked and felt guilty for not noticing.Xi'er was so weak that she could not withstand the aftershocks of the attacks.However, there was no time to think. As soon as he countered this attack, more attacks came from the other men.The saber radiance shined like streaks of lightning, heading toward Su Mo's vital parts.Swirling Winds and Clouds!As a sword slashed, a fierce wind forced both the men and Su Mo back.He could have beaten those men, but he had to make sure that Xi'er could avoid the aftershock of his attack.Before Su Mo could find his footing, the saber radiance swept toward his stomach.The leader had attacked him again.The others also attacked him fiercely and did not give Su Mo the slightest break.The leader struck him at his most vulnerable time, which was after Su Mo finished his last strike and before he could strike again.In order to protect Xi'er, Su Mo had to reign in his attacks, so he could not display his full strength.Su Mo could no longer resisting the attack and could only try his best to dodge it.Puff!Although Su Mo managed to dodge the blade, the saber Qi still left a deep wound on him.His blood streamed out of the wound.\"Brother Su Mo!\" Xi'er was horrified, and tears appeared in her eyes.\"Brother Su Mo, just put me down and forget about me. You should run!\" Xi'er said, sobbing.\"Xi'er, don't be silly. They can't trap me if I don't want to stay.\"Su Mo laughed, and then he swiftly shifted his direction and dashed deeper into the woods.In the blink of an eye, he had run dozens of meters.\"Follow him and don't let him get away!\" The leader ordered and led his men after Su Mo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just put me down!\" Xi'er said on his back.\"Xi'er, stop! I won't leave you for as long as I'm alive!\" Su Mo said firmly.Xi'er felt deeply touched by Su Mo's words.With Xi'er on his back, Su Mo ran like the wind, which caused him to bleed unstoppably.\"I can't keep doing this!\"Su Mo frowned. Bleeding would only make his body weaker.\"I have an idea!\"Suddenly, Su Mo had an idea and began running in another direction.A moment later, he saw a small cave.This was the same place where he had found the Purple Spirit Fruit.Su Mo entered the cave quickly with Xi'er on his back.He glanced around the cave. The corpse of Wei Long, whom he had killed, had been eaten by demonic beasts and reduced to pieces of cloth.\"Xi'er, wait for me here. I'll go out to kill these dogs,\" Su Mo said, putting Xi'er down.\"Brother Su Mo!\" Xi'er firmly grasped Su Mo's hands, looking worried.\"Don't worry! I'll protect you forever! I can't be killed easily!\"Su Mo patted Xi'er's soft hands and kissed her forehead gently. After that, he turned to leave.Xi'er stood there in a daze, like she had been shocked by electricity.\"I will protect you forever!\" Feeling the residual warmth on her forehead, Xi'er recalled Su Mo's words.She cried! Her tears flowed down her cheeks!However, a joyful smile appeared on her face.Su Mo went out of the cave, seeing that it had been surrounded by several men in black.At that moment, Su Mo blocked the entrance of the cave, so Xi'er was quite safe.Without her on his back, he could easily slaughter these enemies.\"Su Mo, you have nowhere to run!\" the leader said with a cold laugh. He had not expected that Su Mo would be so foolish to hide in a cave.Now, Su Mo was trapped like a rat in a hole.\"Who said I need to escape? It's time for you to escape!\" Su Mo sneered, thinking, \"These pieces of trash want to kill me. What a joke!\"\"How dare you still be so rude on your deathbed!\" The middle-aged leader scorned him and shouted, \"Attack him!\"He led the way, chopping his revolving saber toward Su Mo.Buzz!Su Mo's refined sword disappeared and was replaced by a silvery long sword.It was Spirit-slayer.\"You're courting death!\" Su Mo shouted loudly and bore down on the incoming saber without dodging.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"Su Mo applied his strongest movement.The middle-aged man in black was the leader of the enemies, so if he was killed, the others would not stand a chance.His unmatched sword radiance was like dazzling starlight, rising into the sky and tearing through the air.The saber and sword then crashed into each other violently.Boom!A fierce burst of force erupted in all directions.Crack!The leader's long saber was broken. The sword radiance halted for a second before shooting toward the leader with full strength.\"What?\"The leader was frightened, but it was too late for him to dodge, so he could only turn his body to protect his vital organs.Slice!With a flash of sword radiance, a long arm flew into the air and sprayed red blood everywhere like rain.\"Ah!!\"The leader screamed, and his face twisted in severe pain.He retreated quickly away from Su Mo.Su Mo did not attack him again, but instead, he turned and aimed his long sword toward the other men in black.\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\"Su Mo's eyes glinted coldly, and his body flitted around, leaving a series of residual shadows as his long sword kept attacking.\"Gale Blade!\"\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"These men in black only had an Lv 7 Qi cultivation Realm, so they were even weaker than Wei Liang. There was no way they could defeat Su Mo.With the Spirit-slayer Sword, Su Mo became so powerful that he could kill a man with each step.In no time, the rest of them were all killed.\"What...\"The injured leader was greatly frightened and stared at Su Mo in horror.Realizing that it was impossible to kill Su Mo, he turned to escape quickly without hesitation.\"Whoosh!\"Su Mo suddenly sprang forward to block the leader's path.\"Do you think you can escape today?\" Su Mo asked indifferently.\"Su Mo, I beg you... let me go.\"The leader's arm was cut off, and he lost a great deal of blood. His complexion turned as white as paper.\"Well, if you tell me who you are and why you're trying to kill me, I might consider letting you go,\" Su Mo said with a sneer.\"We're guards of the Mansion of the City Governor. His son wants to kill you and capture Xi'er.\" The leader concealed nothing from Su Mo.He was the same guard who had reported Su Mo's whereabouts to Lin Xiao.He knew that it was impossible for him to go back to the Mansion of the City Governor, for he had failed his task and missed an arm. If he went back, he would be killed.Therefore, he did not intend to hide any information.\"Swish!\"As Su Mo was lost in thought, the middle-aged man turned around and escaped.Having seen Su Mo kill the others in a short time, he knew Su Mo would not let him go.\"Whoosh!\"After he ran only a few steps, a sharp sword radiance instantly shot toward him and penetrated his heart.Su Mo's eyes glinted coldly. He was never soft-hearted to his enemies.\"So it's Lin Xiao? He will pay the price for your actions,\" Su Mo murmured.After all the men in black were killed, Su Mo hurried to enter the cave.He saw that Xi'er had come out of the cave and was standing at the entrance, staring at Su Mo.\"Xi'er!\" he called toward her.\"Brother Su Mo!\"She suddenly ran like the wind to Su Mo and entered his arms, holding his waist tightly.Su Mo smelled her elegant fragrance, and he was calmed by the touch of her soft body.\"Xi'er, don't be afraid! I've killed them.\" Su Mo patted her back to comfort her.After a while, she left Su Mo's arms, slightly blushing.\"Xi'er, weren't you curious about how I mummified the demonic beasts?\" Su Mo said suddenly, \"In fact, human beings are the same. In a second, I'll swallow their essence and blood.\"Su Mo went to the corpses and sat cross-legged, releasing his Martial Soul.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mo sat cross-legged next to the corpses of the men in black and released his Devouring Martial Soul.Their essence, blood, and Martial Souls immediately converged toward him.Their Martial Souls, including the leader's, were all only at Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul, so they barely had an impact on Su Mo's Martial Soul progression.However, most of them were at Lv 7, and the leader was at Lv 8, so their essence and blood held a great amount of energy.After devouring only half of their essence and blood, Su Mo felt his genuine Qi increase intensely and break through a barrier in cultivation.He had reached Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm!As he kept devouring, his cultivation was still rapidly increasing.Early Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm!Middle Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm!Late Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm!When Su Mo's cultivation had almost reached the peak Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm, he had devoured all the remaining essence.All the corpses became mummies.Huff!He slowly exhaled a mouthful of heavy air.He turned to look at Xi'er, who was staring at Su Mo with her mouth slightly ajar and a stunned face.\"Xi'er, now you know what I meant!\" He stood up and walked toward her.\"Brother Su Mo, this...\"Xi'er was shocked beyond words and stared at him with wide eyes.\"Haha, this is my Martial Soul's special ability.\" Su Mo explained with a smile.Even he himself had been extremely shocked by this ability at first.He had never heard of Martial Souls that could turn essence into Qi, or more importantly, increase their level.\"Oh!\" Xi'er nodded in confusion.\"Let's keep hunting demonic beasts!\"\"Brother Su Mo, your wound is still bleeding!\" Xi'er exclaimed, looking at the gash on his body.\"It's alright. It's just a scrape. I'll be fine after I take an elixir!\" he said with a wave of his hand and swallowed a healing elixir.Once the pill healed his wound, he and Xi'er continued to forge into the woods.Boom! Boom! Boom!Su Mo crazily killed demonic beasts as he went like a maniac.Anything that walked into his path was instantly killed.He would have killed the flying beasts, too, if only he could reach them!Soon, he had walked over 15 kilometers into the woods and killed more than 40 demonic beasts.However, even after he devoured their Beast Souls, essence, and Qi, his Martial Soul and cultivation still did not progress.All these demonic beasts were of Class 4 or 5 Lv 1. They had little effect on his Martial Soul, and their blood only increased his cultivation to the peak Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm.The essence and blood of more than 40 Class 4 and 5 Lv 1 demonic beasts was not even equivalent to the essence and blood of a martial artist at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.As they got deeper into the woods, they began to meet demonic beast with higher levels.Roar!A giant Demonic Bear appeared in front of him.This bear was as black as ink, almost seven meters tall, and weighed about 1500 kilograms. Its massive body exuded a thick cloud of demonic Qi.This was definitely a Class 6 Lv 1 Demonic Beast.\"Haha!\"Su Mo was overjoyed and swiftly ran forward.Roar!Spotting a human that had ventured into its territory, the Demonic Bear immediately let out a roar that shook the entire forest.Its giant body thundered towards Su Mo, breaking countless tall trees in its path. It swung its paws, which were as big as millstones, towards Su Mo's head.Although this Demonic Bear was only Class 6 Lv 1, its massive body and powerful strength made it equivalent to a Class 7 Lv 1 one.Swish!Despite this, the Demonic Bear still could not block Su Mo's brilliant sword, which immediately cut off its paw and half of its head.Blood and brains spewed everywhere.Boom!The Demonic Bear's giant body immediately crashed down.Su Mo immediately devoured its essence and blood, transformed it into genuine Qi, and absorbed it into his elixir field.The genuine Qi in his elixir field had already reached the brink.He wanted to break through to Lv 7 but was still unsuccessful after two tries.\"It's still not enough. I need a little more!\"Su Mo moved on with Xi'er.On the way, he kept killing and devouring.Finally, after Su Mo had killed and devoured eight Class 6 Lv 1 demonic beasts and two Class 7 Lv 1 ones, his elixir field swelled.His genuine Qi increased greatly once again, and an aura arose from his body that was much stronger than that of Lv 6.He entered the Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm!In a short couple of hours, Su Mo had progressed from the Peak Lv 5 into the Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.If other martial artists learned about his cultivation speed, they would be scared to death.\"Leveling-up is too easy!\" Su Mo exclaimed with joy.He had originally estimated that it would take him two days in Breezewind Mountain to reach Lv 7.He had not expected that he would achieve it in only half a day.\"It's so fast!\"Devouring essence and blood increased his cultivation much faster than he had expected.Of course, all of the men in black had also helped greatly.\"If I kept killing here for two weeks, would my cultivation reach the Spiritual Martial Realm?\"Su Mo's heart was burning with excitement.However, he soon rejected this notion.Increasing his cultivation this way no doubt muddled his genuine Qi and made it unstable.Also, after he killed the guards from the Mansion of the City Governor and prevented Lin Xiao from getting his way, Lin Xiao would probably send more men after him.It was best for Xi'er's safety to go home soon.Su Mo could tell from the sky that it was still early in the afternoon, so he decided to hunt a few more demonic beasts before taking Xi'er back.He continued killing and ended up hunting more than 10 Class 7 Lv 1 demonic beasts by nighttime.After he devoured them, Su Mo's cultivation reached Late Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.His cultivation had improved drastically.However, his Martial Soul had still not progressed even after devouring all of these Beast Souls.Su Mo estimated that if he wanted to increase his Martial Soul to Rank 7 Human Class, he would have to devour at least a couple hundred more Class 7 Lv 1 Beast Souls.This task was too big to be undertaken by killing demonic beasts one by one.It was better to buy them directly.It was late, and Su Mo did not want to stay any longer. He swiftly left Breezewind Mountain with Xi'er and returned to Sunnywood City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mo was quietly cultivating in his room.His Devouring Martial Spirit floated behind him, and he was enveloped by Spiritual Qi.The endless Spiritual Qi turned into runes and melted into Su Mo's body.He was cultivating the Lv 3 of the Elephant's Strength Skill.After completing the Lv 2 cultivation skill, Su Mo's physical strength had surpassed that of six tigers but was still weaker than that of seven.Now that he was cultivating the Level Three cultivation method, his physical strength was once again rapidly increasing.Endless amounts of Spiritual Qi entered him, turning into elephant-shaped runes that were absorbed by his body crazily.Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, 10 days had already passed.During these 10 days, Su Mo had only spared a little time to cultivate his genuine Qi. Once his cultivation had reached the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, he used all his time to cultivate his body.His physical strength was increasing even faster than his cultivation.During 10 days, he had already reached the middle stage of Lv 3 of the Elephant's Strength Skill.Su Mo felt like his body had an explosive power that could allow him to break the air with a single punch.The strength of eight tigers!His physical strength alone equaled that of a martial artist at Level Eight.Lv 3 of the Elephant's Strength Skill was actually ten times more difficult to cultivate than Level One.However, Su Mo's Martial Soul was now ten times faster at absorbing Spiritual Qis than before.\"Huff!\"Su Mo stopped cultivating and walked out of his room.\"Xi'er, what are you looking at?\"Xi'er was sitting on a stone chair in the yard, resting her cheeks in her hands and pursing her lips slightly. She looked adorable.\"Brother Su Mo, you're out of seclusion!\" Xi'er exclaimed joyfully when she saw Su Mo.\"Yes!\"\"Xi'er, have you reached the peak of the Body Tempering Realm yet?\" asked Su Mo.The corners of Xi'er's mouth curled into a beautiful smile that spread like a blooming flower.\"I didn't let you down! I've already completed the Ninefold Body Tempering,\" said Xi'er proudly, lifting her snow-white chin slightly.\"Good. Once I finish my challenge match today, I'll help you awaken your Martial Soul.\"Su Mo was also happy for Xi'er and said with a smile, \"Soon, my Xi'er will also be a real martial artist!\"\"Hehe!\" Xi'er giggled.\"Let's go! Xi'er, today is the day of the clan meeting's challenge matches.\"They walked toward the clan's martial practice field....A simple grandstand had been set up in the martial practice field.On the stand stood Master Su Hong and various other elders.Below the spectators stand, 10 wooden chairs were placed neatly, with over 100 young Su disciples gathering around the chairs.Su Mo and Xi'er's arrival attracted many people's attention.After his battle with Wei Liang, Su Mo was now considered a legend in the Su clan.However, some still looked down on him.Su Tianhao and Su Hai did not even bother to look at him.\"Humph!\" Su Yu glanced at Su Mo and scoffed with jealousy.He had taken Liu Yushan from Su Mo, but Su Mo had found a girl much more beautiful than Liu Yushan, making Su Yu extremely envious.Su Mo ignored everyone's looks and walked onto the martial practice field.After a while, Master Su Hong scanned the crowd, stood up, and said, \"Alright, now that almost everyone is here, let's begin the challenge matches.\"\"First, I'll announce the 10 seeded disciples.\"\"Su Tianhao!\"\"Su Hai!\"\"Su Yu!\"\"Su Mei!\"\"Su Mo!\"\"Su Peng!\"\"...\"Su Hong announced 10 names.\"The 10 of you are the seeded competitors. You can take your seats in front of the stand.\"\"If anyone thinks they're powerful enough, they have two chances to challenge any of these disciples.\"\"Alright, let the challenge matches begin!\"The 10 seeded disciples sat in their seats, including Su Mo.Su Mo knew that these so-called challenge matches were actually no more than a formality.These 10 seeded disciples were basically the 10 strongest people among the Su clan inferiors.Su Tianhao and Su Hai were both at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, and the girl called Su Mei, who was the second elder's daughter, was at Lv 8.Even the weakest ones among them were at Lv 6.Next, people began to challenge the seeded disciples.Almost everyone chose to challenge the weakest disciples.After an hour, the challenge matches ended.Besides a disciple at Level Six who successfully replaced a seeded disciple, all other challengers failed.Su Mo and the other rest were too powerful, so they were never challenged.The challenge matches soon ended, and Su Mo prepared to leave.\"Su Mo,\" Su Yu suddenly said, walking toward him.\"Yes?\" Su Mo asked.\"Haha! Haven't you heard? Wei Rufeng announced publicly that if you attended this martial arts competition, he'd break your limbs and ruin your cultivation to avenge his brother and Wei Liang.\" Su Yu smiled, his eyes full of gloating.\"Wei Rufeng is back?\"Su Mo arched his brow.Wei Rufeng was Wei Lin's older brother and the oldest son of the Master, Wei Wankong. He was also the first genius of the Weis.He left Sunnywood City a year ago and entered one of the four sects in Skymoon Country, Scorching Sun Sect.\"If he wants to avenge his brother, I'm afraid he doesn't have the ability to do so!\"Su Mo shook his head unconcernedly and left with Xi'er.\"Humph! How delusional! Has his confidence grown to this extent after defeating Wei Liang?\" Su Yu sneered....Su Mo left the martial practice field with Xi'er and went to the Sus' memorial temple.\"Xi'er, I'll help you awaken your Martial Soul now,\" said Su Mo.\"Alright!\" Xi'er nodded nervously.\"Brother Su Mo, what kind of Martial Soul do you think I'll awaken?\" she asked.\"Haha! I don't have the power to predict the future!\"Su Mo smiled and said, \"However, I know that my Xi'er is as beautiful as an elegant phoenix, so your Martial Soul will surely be amazing.\"\"Brother Su Mo, you're teasing me again!\"Xi'er's face instantly turned bright red.Soon, Su Mo and Xi'er reached the clan memorial temple.In the temple was a small altar called the Awakening Altar.However, it was tricky to open the Awakening Altar, since it required a great amount of genuine Qi or Spiritual Qi.The Sus usually waited for a large group of disciples to enter the Body Tempering Realm before awakening their Martial Souls together.\"Xi'er, step onto the altar,\" said Su Mo.Xi'er took a deep breath, slowly and daintily walked up to the altar, and sat down cross-legged.Su Mo walked to the back of the altar, where there was a groove: the magical eye of the Awakening Altar.Usually, the Sus activated this eye with the help of genuine Qi from many elders or abundant Demonic Cores of demonic beasts at the Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo did not have such powerful genuine Qi or such powerful Demonic Cores, but he did have Spiritual Stones.He took out a Spiritual Stone from his storage ring and placed it in the groove.Buzz!As soon as the stone was placed inside, the eye began to work its magic.Suddenly, a great amount of white light erupted from the altar.The white light turned into a strange rune and entered Xi'er's body.Xi'er's body seemed to have a shadow wiggling inside of it.Time trickled by.Su Mo soon saw cracks appearing on the Spiritual Stone in the groove, as if it was about to crumble.This meant the Spiritual Qi in the Spiritual Stone was about to be used up.Su Mo immediately took out a couple more stones and placed one in the groove.More and more runes floated above the altar and enveloped Xi'er's entire body.However, her Martial Soul still did not awaken.Soon, the second Spiritual Stone also ran out of Spiritual Qi, so Su Mo placed the third one in.Then,The fourth one.The 10th one.The 20th one.The 30th one.The 40th one.Su Mo's expression changed, and his eyes were filled with confusion.He had used a lot more Spiritual Stones than were needed to awaken a Martial Soul.The value of 40 Spiritual Stones in gold was about the yearly income of the Sus.If awakening Martial Souls needed this much Spiritual Qi, the Sus would not be able to afford it.Su Mo frowned, gritted his teeth, and kept putting in more Spiritual Stones.50 stones!80 stones!100 stones!105 stones!After a while, all his Spiritual Stones were gone.However, Xi'er's Martial Soul had still not awakened.When the last Spiritual Stone was used up, the Awakening Altar slowly stopped working. It dimmed and became silent again.Su Mo's face darkened. \"I've used over 100 Spiritual Stones, but Xi's Martial Soul still hasn't awakened!\"\"What's going on?\"\"Does Xi not have a Martial Soul?\"There were some people who were born without Martial Souls and could never become martial artists.Su Mo was very confused. He soon dismissed this idea because he could feel Xi'er's Martial Soul vibrating strongly within her.\"Then why won't it awaken?\"Su Mo could not understand.\"Brother Su Mo, why... why can't I awaken my Martial Soul?\"Xi'er looked at Su Mo with the same confusion in her eyes.\"I don't know!\"Su Mo shook his head and said, \"Don't worry, Xi'er. We'll go ask my father. He's witnessed many awakenings, so he should know why.\"Then, they left the memorial temple and walked toward Su Hong's quarters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were grand and mysical, as if they were from the heavens.In one of the extravagant palaces, a majestic figure sitting on a dragon chair suddenly stood up.The figure gave off an air of sweeping strength and vigor, and his eyes shone keenly like daggers cutting through the air.\"Servant!\" His call shattered the silence like a bomb.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\"Master!\"\"Master!\"Immediately, dozens of figures flew swiftly into the hall and bowed to him.\"My daughter's tracks appeared in the East Continent.\"The figure stared towards the East, with a rare smile appearing on his stony face.There was finally news of his daughter, who had been lost for more than 10 years!\"Who would like to venture to the East Continent and bring my daughter back?\"The majestic figure's eyes shone like lightning and swept over his servants.\"Your humble servant is willing!\"\"Your humble servant is willing!\"\"Your disciple is willing!\"Everyone answered loudly in unison.\"13th Elder, Hao'er, you two go! You must bring my daughter back to me!\" declared the figure. With a wave of his hand, a small jade plate flew towards the two men. \"This can detect the location of my daughter.\"\"Yes, Master!\"\"Yes, Master!\"A thin old man and dashing youth immediately accepted his order, took the jade plate, and left with a bow....In Sunnywood City, Su Mo and Xi'er returned to the Master's yard to see his father, Su Hong.\"Father, why did this happen? Why can't Xi'er's Martial Soul be awakened?\" Su Mo asked after explaining to his father what happened with Xi'er.\"Let me first examine her!\"Su Hong held her arm in his palm and injected a gust of genuine Qi into her body.As he was examining, he began to frown.Su Mo saw his father's expression, and his heart skipped a beat with dread.\"Father, what's going on with Xi'er?\" Su Mo could not help but ask again.\"There is some kind of force in Xi'er's body that is preventing her Martial Soul from being awakened!\" Su Hong declared with uncertainty. His eyes revealed a hint of concern, and he stopped inspecting.\"Force?\" Su Mo was confused.\"I see. It's a seal. Xi'er's Martial Soul can't be awakened because it's been sealed!\" he suddenly realized something and said in shock.\"What? A seal?\" Su Mo turned to Xi'er in confusion and asked, \"Xi'er, how could you have a seal inside your body?\"Xi'er shook her head, looking lost as well.Su Hong thought, \"Sealing is a very advanced method that most people do not possess. I've only seen it a couple of times.\"He was even more confused given Xi'er's past.She was merely a girl from a mountainous village. Why had a martial arts master placed a seal inside her?\"Father, is there any way to break the seal?\" Su Mo asked desperately.Su Hong shook his head and said with a sigh, \"I've only encountered seals a few times before. I know nothing about breaking them. The art of seals is too advanced for people like me.\"Su Mo's brows furrowed. If he could not break the seal inside Xi'er's body, she would never be able to awaken her Martial Soul.He could not allow this to happen.\"Mo'er, no one in Sunnywood City can break this seal. It's likely that only masters in the large Sects outside the city can do it,\" said Su Hong.\"Brother Su Mo, don't worry. It's alright if I can't awaken my Martial Soul!\" Xi'er said with a forced smile.Xi'er did not want him to worry too much about her.\"Don't worry, Xi'er! I promise to find a way to break your seal and help you awaken your Martial Soul,\" Su Mo said firmly, seeing the disappointment in her eyes.With his talent, he would eventually be powerful enough to leave Sunnywood City and find a way to break Xi'er's seal.Since his father could not break it, Su Mo did not have any other options.Just as he was about to leave with Xi'er, Su Hong stopped him and advised, \"Mo'er, the martial arts competition starts in three days! Wei Rufeng of the Wei clan announced publicly that he would avenge his brother at this competition. He wants to break your limbs and ruin your cultivation. If you run into him, just give up without a fight.\"\"What cultivation is Wei Rufeng?\" Su Mo asked.\"I heard that he's already reached the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. He's very powerful, maybe even stronger than Su Tianhao,\" said Su Hong.\"Wei Rufeng only achieved at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. How dare he talk so recklessly?\" Su Mo thought.Su Mo scoffed with a hint of coldness in his eyes and said, \"He should know better and learn from his brother's mistakes.\"Afterwards, Su Mo and Xi'er left.Su Hong was shocked at first, then smiled bitterly and his head. His son was growing more mysterious and confusing by the day!After returning, Su Mo and Xi'er sat down in their own yard.\"Xi'er, in the new year, when the martial arts competition is over, I'll take you out of Sunnywood City. There are many masters out there who must know how to break your seal,\" Su Mo comforted gently.\"I'm sorry Brother Su Mo. I'm such an inconvenience to you!\" Xi'er lowered her head apologetically.\"Silly girl, don't be so polite with me!\" He rubbed her head adoringly.He had developed feelings for this gentle and naive girl.\"Brother Su Mo, I don't want to become a burden to you.\" Xi'er looked up at Su Mo, her eyes filled with determination. She said, \"You're incredibly talented and belong to the world outside. I'll wait at home for you to return.\"\"Ho ho! Silly girl!\"Su Mo's heart was moved. He brought her into his arms.Her body was shaking slightly, but she did not resist him and instead lay her head on Su Mo's shoulder.Neither of them spoke, but the passion was blooming in both of their hearts.At that moment, Xi'er felt nothing but joy.Su Mo felt very calm, when he held her.As someone who had lived two lives, he had never felt as calm as he did at this moment.In his past life, he had been constantly battling in blood and fire, making him stressed all the time.Now, holding Xi'er made him feel so calm. A deep sense of attachment arose in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A strong flow of Qi was constantly moving around him.He was trying to break through to the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.He had reached the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm a couple days ago and spent the last three days trying to break through the realm bottleneck.After a long time, Su Mo opened his eyes, which revealed a hint of frustration.He still had not broken into a new realm.His cultivation had increased too rapidly recently. After he devoured a large amount of Blood and Qi in Breezewind Mountain, his cultivation spiked from the Peak Lv 5 to the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.This speed made his cultivation unstable and incapable of making more breakthroughs for a while.Though he was at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, his strength was equivalent to Lv 8.Combined with his physical strength of eight tigers, he could even defeat martial artists at Lv 9.He would definitely win first place in the martial arts competition today.He left his room with Xi'er and followed the clan elders to the Mansion of the City Governor, where the competition would be held.The mansion was located in the northern section of Sunnywood City. It looked like a small palace and was very majestic.Its steel gate was about five meters tall, rivaling even the city gate.A large crowd flooded into the mansion. They were all invited by the City Governor to watch the competition.\"Look, the Sus are here!\"A sudden uproar swept through the crowd.\"Look! That's Su Tianhao, a strong contender for first place.\"\"That's Su Hai behind him. His abilities are second only to Su Tianhao.\"Everyone only discussed Su Tianhao and Su Hai, the two strongest disciples in the Su clan.Just then, another group of people walked over.It was the Weis.\"Haha! Su Hong, your clan will be completely defeated in this competition,\" said Wei Wankong as he approached them.\"Wei Wankong, martial arts competitions are about actual ability, not chitchat!\" Su Hong said mockingly, glancing at Wei Wankong.\"Humph! Let's wait and see!\" sneered Wei Wankong.Next to Wei Wankong stood a youth in purple who looked vaguely like him.He was the eldest son of Wei Wankong, Wei Rufeng.Wei Rufeng's eyes scanned the members of the Sus and landed on Su Mo.Pat! Pat! Pat!Wei Rufeng stormed over to Su Mo.\"What?\"Su Mo arched his brow and glanced at him.\"You small fry, you'd better pray you don't have to go against me, or you'll end up begging for your death.\" Wei Rufeng smiled menacingly.\"How dare you! Wei Rufeng, you...\" Su Hong yelled at Wei Rufeng, who was threatening his son in front of him, but Su Mo interrupted him. He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, \"Wei Rufeng, I'd say the same to you!\"Wei Rufeng smiled mockingly and turned to look at Su Tianhao with strong fighting desire in his eyes.\"Su Tianhao, you're the only person worthy of fighting me among the Sus. Don't let me down!\"Wei Rufeng looked haughty, and his tone was incredibly proud.\"Humph! Those are bold words! Wei Rufeng, I'm curious to see the moves you've learned in the Scorching Sun Sect!\" Su Tianhao chuckled with the same fighting desire raging in him.Wei Rufeng was a disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect, one of the four sects of Skymoon Country. It was just as powerful as the Sky Yuan Sect.\"I'll be waiting!\"Wei Rufeng turned around and strode toward the Mansion of the City Governor.The Weis followed him.\"Tianhao, what do you think your chances of beating Wei Rufeng are?\" asked the third Su elder.\"I have a 50-50 chance!\" Su Tianhao said, \"Besides, I also can't underestimate Lin Qiong, the daughter of the city governor. They're both my biggest competitors for first place.\"The Sus nodded. These three were the only disciples in this competition who were at the peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.It seemed there would be a fierce battle among them.The Sus also entered the mansion.Inside was a vast martial practice field that could easily hold 10,000 people.A large square fighting arena was built in the middle of the field.There were also spectators stands all around the arena.The stands facing east, west, and north were already packed with members of the Mansion of the City Governor, the Weis, and the Sus. In front of each family sat 10 of their most outstanding disciples.Spectators of lesser prestige did not have the right to sit with them, so they all stood below the spectator stand.\"Look, that beautiful girl is the daughter of the city governor, Lin Qiong,\" someone said, pointing to a slender and delicate girl in blue standing in front of the north spectators stand.\"She's so beautiful! She's also so talented to have reached the peak Lv 9 at the age of 17.\"\"Yes! The champion will undoubtedly be her, Wei Rufeng, or Su Tianhao!\"\"...\"The audience chattered on for a long time.There were only a couple of people sitting in the south spectators stand.In the middle sat a beautiful woman with a captivating body and charming face. Her presence attracted everyone's attention.She was the leader of Purple Gold Pavilion, Luo Huan.Su Mo stood on the east spectators stand and was very shocked to see her.\"It seems that Purple Gold Pavilion is so powerful that even the Mansion of City Governor dares not disrespect them!\"Perhaps sensing Su Mo's gaze, Luo Huan turned to look at him and smiled charismatically.Su Mo turned away from her enticing stare in a hurry.Suddenly, the tall and stern city governor, Lin Sheng, stood up on the north spectators stand.He scanned the crowd, smiled, and said loudly, \"Welcome to the martial arts competition of the Mansion of the City Governor for Sunnywood City. I'll stop wasting your time. Let the games begin!\"He nodded at the Sus and Weis and sat back down.A middle-aged man next to Lin Sheng stepped into the fighting ring.He was the manager of the Mansion of the City Governor, Lin De.\"There are 30 participants in this competition. Everyone will compete in the elimination matches. To ensure fairness, come up now to draw lots.\"Li De held a box of pegwood sticks and yelled, \"These 30 sticks are numbered from 1 to 15, so whichever two people draw the same number will be fighting each other.\"All the competing disciples went into the ring to draw lots.Su Mo went up and took a pegwood.He drew number 15, the last number.When everyone was done drawing lots, Lin De yelled, \"Let the martial arts competition begin! The two competitors who drew number 1 should stay in the arena. Everyone else, please wait outside.\"One of the competitors was a disciple of the Weis. His name was Wei Cheng, and he had a Level Seven Qi cultivation.Unfortunately, his competitor was Su Hai.\"I give up.\" Wei Cheng dejectedly raised his hand.Su Hai won by default.No one looked down on Wei Cheng for doing this because his Qi cultivation was only at Lv 7, while Su Hai's was already at Early Lv 9. Fighting Su Hai would only bring more humiliation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now would the two No.2 competitors come forward?\" Lin De declared.One of these two competitors was a disciple from the Mansion of the City Governor, and the other was a disciple of the Weis.Both were at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, and they were locked in a fierce combat from the very beginning.\"Steel-Smashing Palm!\"\"Fierce Tiger Fist!\"After sparring for a bit, they came at each other with their unique skills.Bang!By the end, the slightly weaker Wei disciple was pushed back a couple of steps. His opponent seized the opportunity and sent him flying with a punch.\"Lin He wins!\" Lin De announced.Next were the two No.3 competitors.The competitions continued in full swing. After every fight, the loser left feeling dejected while the winner left feeling cheerful and confident.\"Let the No.7 competitors come forward!\"As the words left Lin De's lips, two figures flew into the fighting ring.One of them was Su Peng of the Sus. He turned pale and frightened upon seeing his competitor.That was because his competitor was Lin Qiong, daughter of the City Governor.\"I give up!\" Su Peng said helplessly.Su Peng was only at the Peak of Level Six, so there was no point in fighting Lin Qiong.Lin Qiong calmly and silently flew out of the fighting ring, as if she had expected him to give up.The combats continued.It became clear that the inferior disciples of the Mansion of the City Governor and the Weis were generally stronger than those of the Sus.Although the Sus had two disciples at Level Nine of the Qi Cultivation Realm, they had only one disciple at Level Eight.On the other hand, the Weis and the Lins had one disciple at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm and three or four disciples at Lv 8.\"Now, let the No.10 competitors come forward.\"Another two disciples came into the fighting ring.One of them was Wei Rufeng of the Weis, and his opponent was Su Nan of the Sus, who was only at the Peak of Level Six.\"I give up, I give...\"Su Nan chose to give up straight away, just as the crowd had expected. Even the Sus thought it was a smart choice.After all, Wei Rufeng's cultivation was three level higher than Su Nan's.However, something unexpected happened.In the fighting ring, before Su Nan could finish his words, Wei Rufeng struck suddenly with an evil smile and punched Su Nan's chest fiercely.\"Ah!\"Su Nan was thrown out heavily from the ring with a painful scream. He spat out a mouthful of blood and instantly fainted.The crowd suddenly became so silent that one could hear a pin drop. They had no idea that Wei Rufeng would attack Su Nan so abruptly.\"Humph! A piece of trash doesn't have the right to give up!\" Wei Rufeng sneered with an extremely arrogant look.All of the Sus glared at Wei Rufeng fumingly.They were completely enraged by the pompous and conceited Wei Rufeng, who not only humiliated Su Nan, but also injured him badly.He was obviously doing so to provoke the Sus. It felt like a public slap to the face.\"What is this, Wei Wankong? Our disciple already gave up. Why did your disciple still attack him so violently? Do you think you can just trample over the Sus?\" Su Hong stood up and roared.\"Haha! Su Hong, injuries are unavoidable in combat. If your disciple is wounded, you can only blame his weakness!\" Wei Wankong smiled slightly and was unfazed by Su Hong's rage.\"You... Fine, since you said so, the Sus won't hold back either!\" Su Hong said coldly.\"Humph! Then let's fight!\" Wei Wankong sneered.\"Alright, alright, Brother Su and Brother Wei, please calm down. Don't get so worked up over a combat!\"Lin Sheng, the city governer, suddenly stood up and tried to make peace. Although he was happy to see the two families clashing and restricting each other, he did not want them to mess up the competition.\"From now on, intentional injuries are forbidden. Whoever breaks this rule will be severely punished!\"Lin Sheng glanced around and loudly declared, \"Continue!\"Su Hong caged his anger and kept silent.The competition continued!Soon, Su Tianhao appeared in the ring. He was No.13.His competitor was a disciple of the Weis with a cultivation at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.Although he did not give up and attacked Su Tianhao fiercely from the start, he was easily beaten.Su Tianhao was also quite angry with the Weis, but he did not injure his competitor due to the City Governor's words.Soon, it was Su Mo's turn.He smiled bitterly. He was No.15, which meant he was in the final group to fight in this round, and whoever had not gone up yet would be his competitor.This person was Su Yu!In the fighting ring, Su Mo and Su Yu stood 10 steps apart.\"Su Mo, just give up!\" Su Yu said proudly as soon as he walked into the ring.\"Oh? Why should I?\" Su Mo asked curiously with a dashing smile.\"Humph! Do you think you can beat me?\" Su Yu asked, smirking coldly.\"We'll find out after this fight,\" Su Mo said with a flat tone and calm demeanor.Su Yu frowned at Su Mo's tone. Although he felt confident, he also had witnessed Su Mo's strength and could not underestimate him.However, even so, he was still confident that he would win.In the spectators stand of the Sus, the first elder glanced at Su Hong proudly and said, \"Master, your son will be eliminated. How unlucky that he needs to face Yu in his first fight!\"\"First elder, how can you be so sure that your son will win?\" asked Su Hong.\"Haha! It's obvious!\"The first elder snickered and said, \"Although Su Mo's strength isn't bad and is almost equal to a martial artist at Level Seven, he'll lose to Yu without a doubt!\"\"Since you're so confident, let's wait and see!\"Su Hong did not want to argue with the first elder anymore and stared at the fighting ring. \"The truth will speak for itself,\" he thought.Nearby, another pair of eyes stared at the fighting ring with mixed emotions as well.They belonged to Liu Yushan.She had abandoned Su Mo and chosen Su Yu, abiding by the logical law that clever birds chose their trees when they nest.However, Su Mo, who she had spurned, had astonished her with his great strength in his fight with Wei Liang.Still, she had no regrets. Although Su Mo was powerful, his talent was nothing compared to Su Yu's.Their fight today would prove this fact.At this moment, the two competitors were engaged in combat in the ring.\"Ho!\" Su Yu shouted as his arms and body twisted into a strange pose, like a coiled poisonous snake giving off a cold aura.Su Mo instantly felt a chill, as if he was fixed by the snake's stare.\"My Gosh! It's Nine Variables of Viper, a Level Two martial art technique!\" cried someone among the Sus who had recognized Su Yu's move.Su Mo was shocked. He had not expected that Su Yu had cultivated a Lv 2 martial arts technique!Nine Variables of Viper was a Lower Lv 2 martial arts technique of the Sus. Normal disciples did not have the opportunity to cultivate it.Generally, only people in the Spiritual Martial Realm could cultivate this martial arts technique.\"Is this why you're so confident?\"Su Mo shook his head and sighed. The clan had really invested everything in Su Yu, even letting him cultivate Lv 2 martial arts techniques!Moreover, to his surprise, Su Yu's cultivation was the same as his, at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had used eight variables of Nine Variables of Viper but could not hurt Su Mo at all. Su Mo was more powerful than he had expected.\"Swallowing Like a Whale!\" He shouted, his palms turning into claws that resembled the mouths of vipers. One claw shot toward Su Mo.\"Time to end this!\" Su Mo murmured.Driving his genuine Qi to increase his aura, he punched with full force.After a long stretch of fighting with Su Yu, he knew the extent of power of Nine Variables of Viper.It was quite powerful. With this technique, Su Yu could probably contend with a martial artist at Lv 8.Boom!His fist landed on Su Yu's claw. A burst of Qi swept through the ring. Then, Su Yu was pushed away like a broken kite, and after drawing a beautiful arc in the air, he crashed down under the fighting ring.Su Mo had controlled his strength so that he only threw Su Yu out of the ring instead of injuring him.\"How... how could it be?\"Su Yu's face darkened, and his eyes were full of astonishment. \"You...you're actually at the Peak of Level Seven!\"Su Yu could not believe that Su Mo had reached the same cultivation as himself.Su Mo practiced a Level Three cultivation method, which was more advanced than the methods of any of the people present. Additionally, he did not reveal his cultivation aura, so no one knew his real cultivation.Everyone in the Sus' spectator stand was shocked.\"The cultivation at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"\"His cultivating speed is way too quick!\"\"Over a month ago, he was at the Peak Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"\"Haha! Good! That's my son!\" Su Hong laughed and gloatingly glanced at the first elder.The first elder was ashamed, and his face was continuously twitching. He had tried his best to cultivate Su Yu at the expense of the family's countless resources, but Su Yu was only at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.Meanwhile, with a useless Martial Soul, Su Mo had the same cultivation speed as Su Yu!Also, with the same cultivation, Su Yu was no match for Su Mo.Beneath the spectators stand, Liu Yushan grew pale and shivered as if she would pass out at any minute.She tightly bit her red lips and stared at the tall figure in the fighting ring.Now, she felt very regretful.On the four spectators stands, many people secretly wondered at Su Mo's success.However, they were only slightly shocked and did not think too highly of Su Mo. He was indeed powerful, but he was still far inferior to the top martial artists of the three families.\"Su Mo wins!\" Lin De exclaimed. Then, he said, \"Now, the second round will begin. No.1 fights against No.2, and No.3 fights against No.4. No.15 can randomly choose one of the winners to compete against. If he wins, he'll replace his opponent.\"The second round began.Su Hai, No.1, strode into the fighting ring. His counterpart was a disciple of the Mansion of the City Governor.Su Hai's opponent was at the Peak Lv 8, but he still defeated him in three movements.\"Su Hai is really powerful!\"\"Yeah! Su Tianhao, Lin Qiong, and Wei Rufeng are at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. If those three fight against each other in advance, one of them will be eliminated, which means that Su Hai will definitely enter the top three.\"\"If they do not fight this round, two of them will certainly fight against each other in the next round.\"The spectators burst into a heated discussion.In the following competitions, Lin Qiong, Su Tianhao, and Wei Rufeng all amazed the spectators with their powers, using one move to defeat their rivals.Su Mei, the only disciple at the Lv 8 among the Sus, fought against a Wei disciple with the same cultivation.After dozens of moves, Su Mei was defeated in dismay.After seven competitions were finished, only Su Mo was left.\"No.15, come into the fighting ring. You can choose one of the winners as your rival. If you win, you can take his or her place,\" announced Lin De.Su Mo flew into the fighting ring and looked around to choose his opponent.Then, he smiled and pointed. \"I choose him!\"Everyone realized that Su Mo had chosen a weaker person to prey on.The rival he chose was a handsome young man in an expensive robe. He was Lin Xiao, son of the City Governor.Lin Xiao had reached the Early Lv 7 Qi cultivation Realm, but he was very lucky to have not fought against a powerful disciple in the previous two rounds, so he remained until now.His cultivation was probably the lowest among all seven progressors.Everyone understood Su Mo's choice, for anyone would choose the least powerful one to compete against.\"You choose me?\" Lin Xiao's face darkened. He did not think he could defeat Su Mo.\"Yes! Do you not have faith in your power? Do you want to give up? Don't you have the guts to fight against me?\" asked Su Mo, his face full of contempt.He was purposefully provoking Lin Xiao to fight on purpose because Lin Xiao might give up without a fight due to his visible advantage.Su Mo still remembered that Lin Xiao had ordered his stooges to abduct Xi and kill him. Though he could not kill Lin Xiao now, he could give him a good spanking in advance.\"You...\"Lin Xiao was enraged at the scorn Su Mo showed him and screamed, \"Su Mo, defeating me isn't so easy.\"Then, he walked into the fighting ring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You deserve my full effort,\" he said loudly with gleeful eyes.\"Humph! Don't just assume you can beat me, even with all your effort!\" Lin Xiao huffed coldly.\"Is that so?\" Su Mo laughed and shouted, \"Then I'll try even harder! Make your move, Lin Xiao.\"Huff!Lin Xiao's face grew serious, and he stopped wasting time and activated all the Qi in his body. With great speed, his palms flew towards Su Mo.Su Mo saw the palms rapidly approaching, and his eyes became cold.\"I'll make you pay for trying to kidnap Xi'er.\"He clenched his fists and swung them with an unstoppable force toward Lin Xiao.The force of Su Mo's punch was twice the force of the one that had just defeated Su Yu.Even if Lin Xiao slightly stronger than Su Yu, he would still be seriously injured by this punch.Crack!\"Ah!\"As expected, Lin Xiao was no match for him. His arm immediately snapped, and he was sent flying backward, screaming and spewing blood.His crimson blood left a long trail in the fighting ring.Lin Xiao crashed heavily below the ring and was hurt so badly that he could not get up for a long time.The entire arena was dead silent.Everyone looked at Su Mo in disbelief.\"The following matches will end when a competitor is about to lose. Anyone who purposefully injures their opponents will be heavily punished!\"Lin Sheng's words from before still lingered in their minds.Now, Su Mo had seriously injured Lin Xiao. It seemed like a blatant disrespect to the city governor.\"Damn it, Lin Xiao, I didn't expect you to be so weak! You can't even take one punch!\" Su Mo stepped forward in shock and said guiltily, \"It's my fault. If I'd know you were so weak, I would've only used 10% of my force.\"\"You... Ahem!\"Lin Xiao was furious. He was about to speak when he started coughing up blood again.He obviously knew that Su Mo had wanted to injure him on purpose.When he had sent his men to kill Su Mo, not a single hitman had returned alive, and he could not even find their corpses.Su Mo must have known that Lin Xiao was behind this attack, and now he was getting his revenge.Even though Lin Xiao knew this, he could not say it aloud.Now, not only had Su Mo seriously injured him, but he had also embarrassed him.He instantly felt rage building up in his heart, which made his injuries even worse.\"How dare you!\" Lin Sheng suddenly roared from the north spectators stand. He smashed the arm of his chair in a fit of rage.\"Su Mo, how dare you act so ruthlessly. Do the words of the city governor mean nothing to you?\" Lin Sheng asked, his face darkening.Su Mo had not only ignored his words, but also injured his son. It enraged him to no end.\"I didn't injure him on purpose!\" Su Mo explained calmly, \"You saw that I considered Lin Xiao to be very powerful, so I wanted to fight him with all my effort. I didn't expect him to be so weak, so I injured him by accident.\"\"You... you act so viciously, and then you dare to refute me?\"Lin Sheng was furious, and his eyes flashed with killing desire.\"City Governor Lin, please remain calm,\" said Su Hong apologetically. \"My son only hurt your son by accident. Everyone here witnessed it. I hope you can be gracious.\"\"Humph! That's easy for you to say. Your son wasn't injured!\" Lin Sheng huffed coldly.\"City Governor, your son's injuries are of utmost importance at the moment. At the end of the martial arts competition, I'll apologize personally to your son on my son's behalf.\"Su Hong's words skillfully saved face for Lin Sheng and gave him a way out.Lin Sheng could not argue further, so he scoffed coldly and ordered someone to carry Lin Xiao out of the ring.\"Next, let the third round of matches begin!\" announced Lin De. \"There are seven competitors left. Four more will be eliminated to determine the top three in this martial arts competition.Now, the seven of you will draw lots once again. Number one will fight with number two, three with four, five with six, and number seven can choose any competitor to fight.\"Lin De took out some bamboo sticks.Su Mo and his competitors drew lots one by one.Su Mo got number. 6.Afterward, Lin De yelled, \"The third round begins now. No.1 and No.2, step into the ring.\"No.1 was Lin Qiong. Her competitor was another Lin disciple.\"I give up.\" The Lin disciple sighed dejectedly. He was hoping that he could fight against Su Mo and enter the top three.Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. If he had encountered anyone else, he definitely would have fought them, even if he did not stand a chance.However, since Lin Qiong and he were both disciples of the Mansion of the City Governor, they had already fought before outside of the competition. There was no need to fight again.\"No.3 and No.4, please step into the ring.\"No. 3 was Wei Rufeng, and No. 4 was exactly Su Hai from the Sus.\"Su Hai, you're no match for me!\" Wei Rufeng said pretentiously as he glanced at Su Hai.\"Really? You can't win a fight just by talking!\" Su Hai retorted.\"Humph! I'll show you just how much better than you I am,\" Wei Rufeng sneered. \"You're worthy of my Roaring Flame Saber Style, which I learned in Scorching Sun Sect.\"Su Hai frowned. He glanced at Wei Rufeng and said, \"Then make your move!\"Wei Rufeng raised his right palm slightly, which immediately began to emit scalding Qi. His hand became as hot as a soldering iron and burned with light flames.\"A hand knife is enough to beat you!\"Wei Rufeng smiled proudly and flew into the sky.\"You're going down!\"Wei Rufeng swung his knife multiple times in midair. Countless knife shadows flew towards Su Hai.Puff!Scalding saber Qi pierced the air, causing space to contort.Wei Rufeng's move was so powerful that it could instantly defeat even martial artists at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"You're so ignorant!\"Su Hai was enraged by Wei Rufeng's belittling attitude. He punched repeatedly with his explosive fists, shattering all of the Sword Qi.The ring sounded with continuous explosions. Qi was flowing everywhere.\"Roaring Flame in the Sky!\"Wei Rufeng used this chance to approach Su Hai and swing towards him. Before his hand knife had even touched him, Su Hai felt a scalding pain.\"He's so powerful!\"Wei Rufeng's power put a lot of pressure on Su Hai.\"Thunder Fist!\"Su Hai was using 120% of his combat force to meet Wei Rufeng's attack.Bang!As Su Hai's fist met the knife, he was forced back many steps.\"You're going down!\" Wei Rufeng yelled. He jumped up, making three continuous slashes with his knife.\"Roaring Flame Triple Cut!\"Three flashes of sword radiance tore through the air and surrounded Su Hai's head.Su Hai's pupils constricted. He felt an extreme sense of fear spread over his body.\"Infinite Thunder Force!\"Su Hai used his strongest move. His fists moved like lightning and gave off thunderous sounds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Boom! Boom!After blocking the first stroke, Su Hai's entire body was shocked.After blocking the second stroke, he was forced back five steps.After blocking the third stroke, he slipped back a dozen meters and fell from the fighting ring.He was defeated!With a cultivation of Lv 9, Su Hai was defeated by Wei Rufeng in three moves.\"Roaring Flame Saber Style of Scorching Sun Sect deserves its reputation!\"\"It's so powerful because it's the top method among all kinds of Medium Lv 2 swordplay!\"\"Since Wei Rufeng is so powerful, I guess Su Tianhao and Lin Qiong are no match for him!\"Wei Rufeng's ability shocked the spectators because he could defeat Su Hai without using his broadsword.Wei Wankong was all smiles and in high spirits.\"Su Hai, you're quite impressive for being able to withstand three moves from me!\"Wei Rufeng looked proudly at Lin Qiong and Su Tianhao, who were standing beside the fighting ring, with fighting desire in his eyes.\"Wei Rufeng won! Next, No.5 will be fighting No.6!\" Lin De announced.It was Su Mo's turn. His opponent was Wei Kun, a disciple of the Weis.\"A piece of trash with a cultivation of Lv 7 also wants to be one of the top three?\" Wei Kun shouted coldly with a jeering expression, \"I'll give you 30 seconds to get out of the ring!\"His words were overbearing, sharp, and extremely arrogant, as if Su Mo meant nothing to him.Su Mo laughed and looked at him as if he was an idiot.\"What are you laughing at?\" Wei Kun asked coldly, \"Do you actually want to fight me?\"\"How dare you act so arrogantly with a lowly cultivation at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm. The people of your family are really all unprincipled,\" sneered Su Mo.\"A lowly cultivation?\"Wei Kun was stunned, but then he said with fierce eyes, \"What ignorant confidence you have! Now that 30 seconds have passed, there's no chance for you to give up!\"With a surging aura bursting out from his body, Wei Kun leaned slightly and gently lifted his right leg, allowing all his genuine Qi to flow into it.Then, he suddenly rushed out like a cheetah, leaping high and then violently bringing down his leg.\"Mountain-shaking Leg Techniques! Shaking Mountain with One Kick!\"With strong momentum and strength, his leg was as heavy as a mountain and stirred up a fierce wind.The wind fluttered Su Mo's clothes, but he stood completely still.Soon, the strong leg kicked him.\"Oh no!\"However, Wei Kun's heart dropped when he realized that he had only kicked a residual shadow.\"Impressive, but you're too slow!\" Su Mo said behind him and swung his fist at the same time.Without any thought, Wei Kun swept his leg back out as soon as he touched the ground.Bang!With a loud explosion, both the fist power and force of the kick dissipated.Wei Kun was forced back five steps and looked shocked.People around were quite startled that Su Mo actually drove off Wei Kun.\"How is Su Mo so strong? Wei Kun's cultivation is at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"Everyone was shocked. Although Su Mo used to be able to fight martial artists whose cultivation was higher than his, his cultivation was only Lv 5 at the time. As the level of cultivation increased, the gap between each level became larger, so it became more difficult to fight martial artists of a higher level.\"Does Su Mo have such a special talent? How can he still fight martial artists of higher levels?\" everyone could not help but wonder.Moreover, Su Mo's swordsmanship was excellent, but he was not even using his sword!\"It shouldn't be possible!\" Wei Kun roared with a gloomy expression, \"How can you be so powerful?\"\"It's ridiculous! Do you think everyone is weaker than you? Can't you accept that there is someone who is stronger than you?\"Su Mo was quite speechless.\"I don't believe you can defeat me!\" Wei Kun shouted and rushed toward Su Mo again with his arms open wide, like a great hawk spreading its wings, and his powerful legs kicking out.\"Continous Kicks!\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Numerous leg shadows moved like rolling mountains or roaring waves, and fierce leg force swept through the air.\"I don't have time to play with you!\"Su Mo used 30% of his power to wave his fists continuously. His endless fist force was like a flowing river.The leg shadows that obscured the sky were instantly broken. Su Mo rapidly moved through the chaos to punch Wei Kun on the sole of his foot.Flop!Wei Kun's body was thrown high and crashed outside the ring.Su Mo turned around and walked off the platform.\"Yes, nice move!\"Su Hong was ecstatic.Standing behind Su Hong, Xi'er also felt pleased for Su Mo and grinned widely.Wei Wankong looked extremely upset, but after glancing at his son, he felt calmer.Defeating Wei Kun was nothing serious. If Su Mo fought Wei Rufeng, he would definitely be defeated.\"Su Mo won!\" Lin De announced. \"Su Tianhao, you can choose an opponent at your will. If you beat your opponent, you will replace him or her and become one of the top three.\"Su Tianhao was the No.7 competitor.He stepped into the fighting ring and glanced down at the other competitors.There were only three people, namely, Lin Qiong, Su Mo, Wei Rufeng.\"Lin Qiong, let's fight!\"After a moment of thought, Su Tianhao chose Lin Qiong.Since Wei Rufeng was too powerful, Su Tianhao decided to leave him for last.As for Su Mo, he disdained him too much to challenge him.\"Haha, Su Tianhao chose Lin Qiong. No matter who wins, one of them will certainly be eliminated, but Su Mo is sure to be one of the top three!\"\"Su Mo is so lucky that he avoided fighting a martial artist at Level Nine and directly entered the top three.\"\"That's right! Su Hai, a martial artist at the Lv 9, has been eliminated, while Su Mo unexpectedly survived until the end.\"Everyone was jealous of Su Mo's luck.Lin Qiong wore blue clothes that showed off her slim figure. With a stomp, she steadily stepped into the fighting ring.\"Su Tianhao, I've been looking forward to this battle for a long time!\" She smiled.\"Me too!\" Su Tianhao nodded and said, \"Well then, let's fight!\"After Su Tianhao said this, a yellow light shone behind him, and a boulder shadow emerged.The Rocky Martial Soul!Su Tianhao's Martial Soul was at the Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul and flashed with four halos.In Sunnywood City, a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul was rare among the junior generations, and Su Yu was the only one who had the Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul.Facing Lin Qiong, Su Tianhao did not take any risks and directly released his Martial Soul.The power of the Martial Soul could enhance the abilities of martial artists a lot. The higher the level of Martial Soul, the more it enhanced strength.Lin Qiong also released her Martial Soul, which was a long black sword, sharp and cold.It was also at the Rank 4 Human Class.\"Water Condensation Swordplay!\"The long sword clanged out of the sheath. Lin Qiong attacked first.As the long sword was swinging, water vapor in the air suddenly condensed into sharp water droplets. They cut through space with the sword radiance.\"This move is useless against me!\" Su Tianhao said flatly as genuine Qi spewed from him. At the same, the shadow of his Martial Soul covered his whole body.Clang! Clang! Clang!The sword radiance was instantly shattered as soon as it hit Su Tianhao's body.The defense of the Rocky Martial Soul was too strong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her move was only to test his abilities, and she obviously did not expect to break his defense just in one strike.Whoosh!Lin Qiong attacked again swiftly. She swung her long sword, which emitted a thin and sharp beam of sword radiance. In the blink of an eye, she was right in front of Su Tianhao.\"Good move! Gold Stone Fist!\" Su Tianhao shouted.Instead of dodging, he charged forward and shattered the sword radiance with his iron fists.He closed in on her with continuous punches.Boom! Boom! Boom!His fist force clashed repeatedly with her sword Qi, stirring up an explosive whirlwind.They were locked in a fierce battle.10 moves!50 moves!100 moves!After the two had exchanged 100 moves, there was still no clear winner among them.\"Wow! How powerful!\"\"This is a real competition between two powerful and well-matched martial artists. It'll take a long time to decide a winner between them!\"\"They're both deserving of being the champion!\"The spectators were all exclaiming at the exciting competition.\"Su Tianhao is about to lose!\" thought Su Mo as he shook his head.Contrary to the spectators, he believed that Su Tianhao would be defeated within another 20 moves.As the competition continued, Lin Qiong fought with more spirit and vigor.On the other hand, Su Tianhao increasingly relied on his defense to block her attacks.Though his defense was strong, her sword was powerful enough to destroy it.Unsurprisingly, Su Tianhao began to lose steam 10 moves later. He was soon wounded with several gashes on his body.\"Su Tianhao, you've lost!\" Lin Qiong yelled.With a sharp and stunning sword ray piercing the air, she stabbed her sword into Su Tianhao's shoulder.\"Ugh!\"A muffled groan escaped Su Tianhao's lips, and he was forced back continuously.Her long sword had left a gaping hole in his shoulder that was spewing blood.The crowd was silent. In the end, Su Tianhao still lost to Lin Qiong.\"Lin Qiong, I'll definitely defeat you one day!\"Su Tianhao was a little disappointed but quickly calmed down.\"Anytime!\"After Su Tianhao left the fighting ring, Lin Qiong looked at her other opponents.She glanced at Su Mo coldly before turning to glare at Wei Rufeng with eyes full killing desire, and she said, \"Wei Rufeng, let's not waste time. Come up here to fight me! Let's prove who's most powerful in Sunnywood City!\"Having defeated Su Tianhao, she felt fully confident in challenging Wei Rufeng.If she defeated him, she would be the champion.As for Su Mo, she did not pay any attention to him.However, she could not ignore the fact that he had injured her little brother. After her battle with Wei Rufeng, she intended to make him pay.\"Haha! Lin Qiong, I don't want to take advantage of you. We'll fight after you rest and regain your genuine Qi.\"Wei Rufeng laughed. He turned to look at Su Mo with killing intent in his eyes. \"Su Mo, it's our turn.\"Su Mo sneered and was about to enter the arena when Lin Qiong objected, \"Wei Rufeng, I don't need to rest!\"She swallowed a medicinal pill and said, \"Let's cut the nonsense and fight!\"Wei Rufeng's face darkened. \"Very well, Lin Qiong. Since you can't wait, I'll grant your wish!\"Then, he stepped into the fighting ring.This time, he carried an ancient long black saber on his back.Clang!Wei Rufeng unsheathed his long saber, and his aura rose swiftly. \"Lin Qiong, let's see what's more powerful. Will it be your Water Condensation Swordplay or my Roaring Flame Saber Style?\"\"Roaring Flame in the Sky!\"Wei Rufeng charged forward.He swung his long saber at Lin Qiong, its knife radiance dyeing the sky red like a rain of fire.Swish! Swish! Swish!Lin Qiong waved her long sword to form a sword curtain and shattered Wei Rufeng's saber radiance into millions of pieces.\"Roaring Flame Burns Cities!\"After an unsuccessful move, Wei Rufeng struck again.His saber radiance scorched the surrounding air like a scalding flame.Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!The saber radiance charged forward, causing the burning air to crackle.Lin Qiong remained calm as she wielded her long sword several times and managed to destroy the saber radiance.\"Haha! This is fun! Here come three more strikes from me!\"Wei Rufeng was now standing right in front of Lin Qiong. With a loud shout, he swung his saber three times and hurled it at her with unstoppable momentum.\"Roaring Flame Triple Cut!\"Wei Rufeng's attacks were extremely fierce and rained on without any sign of stopping.Although Lin Qiong was a girl, she maneuvered her sword with as much speed and force as Wei Rufeng.Clang! Clang! Clang!In the blink of an eye, she blocked Wei Rufeng's saber radiance.\"Here come five more strikes!\" Wei Rufeng became reckless. His long saber thrust madly like an unleashed wild horse, sending crimson saber radiance flying everywhere.Ding, ding, ding...In a split second, saber radiance and sword Qi enveloped the entire arena, obscuring the two martial artists from the crowd.Whoosh! Whoosh!After a moment, the two figures flew backward and stood a dozen meters apart from each other.They left the arena destroyed and etched with saber and sword marks.The crowd trained their eyes on them to see who had won.\"Pfft!\"Lin Qiong's body shook, and a trail of blood trickled from her mouth.Everyone widened their eyes.\"Has Lin Qiong lost?\"\"Lin Qiong, you've lost!\"Wei Rufeng smiled arrogantly and emitted an overpowering aura.Lin Qiong tightly gritted her teeth and said resignedly, \"Wei Rufeng, you're indeed powerful and worthy of the title of number one martial artists among the inferiors in Sunnywood City.\"She then flew out of the fighting ring.\"Hahahaha!\"A round of loud laughter abruptly resounded on the spectators stand. Wei Wankong stood up, grinning from ear to ear.\"Rufeng, congratulations on winning first place! This is a testament to your strength and a honor. I'm proud of you!\"Wei Wankong felt very happy and looked around smugly.Naturally, he was basking in pride thanks to his son's victory.\"Congratulations, Master Wei!\"\"Master Wei, you raised a great son!\"\"Your son is great! Congratulations, Master Wei! Congratulations!\"Some of the commoners under the spectators stand stood up and congratulated Wei Wankong.\"I hereby announce that Wei Rufeng is the champion of this martial arts competition!\" Lin De loudly announced.\"Haha!\"Wei Rufeng smiled and felt extremely spirited.\"What?\" Su Mo frowned and thought, \"Why is Wei Rufeng the champion? I haven't competed yet!\"\"Ahem!\" Su Mo cleared his throat to draw everyone's attention.\"Wei Rufeng is the champion? Are you kidding me?\" Su Mo looked at Lin De and said calmly, \"I have yet to compete!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

People could even hear the sound of a pin dropping.Everyone stared at Su Mo curiously. \"Does he really want to fight Wei Rufeng? Does he think he can defeat him?\"\"Su Mo, what would be the point of a fight?\" Lin De's face darkened, and he said, \"Wei Rufeng is definitely the champion. Your fight with him would be meaningless.\"\"Oh... but how are you sure that Wei Rufeng is the champion before our fight?\" Su Mo scoffed, shrugging his shoulders.According to the competition rules, each of the top three needed to fight the other two to decide the final ranking.There should be three combats, but only the one between Wei Rufeng and Lin Qiong had been held. How could they announce that he was the champion?How ridiculous!The crowd was surprised by Su Mo's confidence. He seemed as if he was actually powerful enough to fight Wei Rufeng.Lin De frowned.\"Supervisor Lin, I should fight him in the finals. Since he wants to fight, I'll grant his wish.\" Wei Rufeng smiled. He turned to Su Mo and said, \"I'll absolutely destroy you. I'm afraid you'll give up immediately.\"\"Don't worry. I'll never give up,\" said Su Mo.Wei Rufeng smile insidiously. Su Mo's words were exactly what he wanted to hear.If Su Mo did not give up, Wei Rufeng could keep attacking and seriously injure him without receiving any blame.\"However, what if you're the one to give up?\" Su Mo asked, looking at Wei Rufeng innocently, as if he did not know his intentions.Wei Rufeng was stunned at first and then could not help but laugh. \"Me? Give up? Haha! That's the funniest joke I've ever heard.\"\"Fine, then let's fight!\" Su Mo stepped into the fighting ring and gazed at Wei Rufeng.\"Su Mo is way too confident!\"\"Exactly! Beating Wei Kun must have made him cocky!\"\"I don't think he can take even three moves from Wei Rufeng!\"Nobody thought highly of Su Mo or believed that he was an equal opponent for Wei Rufeng.On the spectators stand, even Su Hong's face was full of worry. Although Su Mo had exceeded his expectation time after time, he did not think Su Mo had the strength to defeat Wei Rufeng.Xi'er was perhaps the only one in the martial practice field who had great faith in Su Mo, because she adored him blindly.In the fighting ring, Su Mo drew his long sword from its sheath with a clang, and his aura instantly changed. Sharp and brilliant Qi spread from him. His eyes were as sharp as a piercing sword.Wei Rufeng was a little shocked by Su Mo's vigor, but only a little bit.\"Cut!\" he shouted, lifting his dazzling long saber up high and slashing it quickly towards Su Mo.Puff!A scalding saber radiance flew out, melting the air.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Su Mo swiftly stabbed his long sword three times.Crackle!With a crisp sound, Su Mo's sword shattered Wei Rufeng's saber radiance into pieces before they hit him. A wave of Qi rippled in the air.\"You're going down!\" Wei Rufeng rushed to the front of Su Mo with one step.\"Roaring Flame Triple Cut!\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The blade of Wei Linfeng's long saber tore the air into pieces with a shrill sound, and the scorching sword radiance even set the air ablaze.\"Su Mo is about to lose!\" everyone thought. \"This is the move that defeated Su Hai before, and even he couldn't take three cuts, never mind Su Mo.\"\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"Su Mo calmly poured genuine Qi into his long sword, causing its sword radiance to grow quickly. A fierce gale sprang up as he brandished his sword toward Wei Rufeng.Boom! Boom! Boom!Wei Rufeng's saber and Su Mo's sword clashed constantly, exploding with Qi. Su Mo's long hair and clothes were flowing, but his body remained steady.\"What?\"\"He blocked the attacks!\"The crowd widened their eyes in amazement at the calm youth before them.\"He's really something! No wonder he's so arrogant!\"Wei Rufeng squinted at Su Mo and shouted coldly, \"You're only hanging on by a thread! I'll give you nine cuts more!\"He jumped into the air, swung his saber down toward Su Mo with enough power to split a mountain.\"Roaring Flame Nine Cut!\"Nine streams of fiery-red saber Qi burst out in different directions, forming a giant formation of cuts.\"Break!\" Su Mo shouted and did not back down.He charged forward and swept his sword with varied power. The sharp sword radiance became one with the wind.Boom! Boom! Boom!With an explosion of Qi, the formation of cuts was broken.Su Mo's sword cut through the formation.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"Powerful sword radiance merged with the wind to become as fast as lightning and shot towards Wei Rufeng.\"Damn it!\"Not only had Wei Rufeng's attack been broken, but he had also been beaten back by Su Mo. In a violent rage, he put all his genuine Qi into his long saber and fiercely hit the sword radiance.Boom! Crack!With an explosive sound and a sudden gust of wind, they both flew back.Su Mo frowned and looked at the long sword in his hand.The tip of his refined sword was broken off, and the entire blade was full of cracks.Su Mo's refined sword was only a Medium Lv 1 weapon and could not endure his power anymore.Besides, Wei Rufeng's weapon was obviously not at a low rank. The tip of Su Mo's sword had been broken by his long saber.\"Haha! Su Mo, your sword is already broken. You'll lose today!\" Wei Rufeng said with a laugh.With a cold laugh, Su Mo was considering whether he should take out the Spirit-slayer Sword, when Su Hong suddenly yelled, \"Mo'er, take this sword!\"On the spectators stand, Su Hong snatched a sword from an elder beside him and threw it to Su Mo.\"What a great sword!\"Taking a look at it, Su Mo's eyes lit up.It was a silver sword that was over a meter long. Although the wide blade looked ancient and simple, its sharpness was undeniable.At Lv 2, this weapon was not as good as his Spirit-slayer Sword, but it was much better than his refined sword.\"Wei Rufeng, you're not so powerful after all. You're definitely going to lose today!\"Su Mo's flickering figure shot out suddenly, too fast to be seen by the naked eye.\"He's so fast!\"Wei Rufeng was astonished and looked grave. He no longer looked down upon Su Mo.Pew!Su Mo used his Shadow Steps to the extreme and suddenly appeared on Wei Rufeng's left, slashing his sword.Clang!Wei Rufeng trembled as he blocked the strike with his saber. In the next second, Su Mo disappeared again, and then he showed up behind Wei Rufeng.Slash!The cold and forceful blade sent chills up Wei Rufeng's spine. He leaned slightly to one side and swung his saber against this cut.Swish! Swish! Swish!Su Mo kept leaping around Wei Rufeng, dealing one cut after another. Each cut was stronger and more powerful than the one before.In close combat, Su Mo was able to exploit the advantage of his physical strength to the fullest extent.Boom! Boom! Boom!One step.Two steps.Three steps.With each explosion, Wei Rufeng was forced backwards continuously. He felt his arms go limp and numb, and his Qi blood boiled throughout his body.He was enraged and roared in anger.\"What? Wei Rufeng is being suppressed by Su Mo!\"\"How could it be? Su Mo is so powerful! How unexpected!\"\"Gosh! His cultivation is only the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm! He's already so powerful!\"The crowd was shocked.Su Mo's attacks became extremely violent. With incomparable speed, he continually cut with the force of wind, every cut faster than the one before.\"Gale Blade!\"\"Swirling Clouds and Clouds!\"\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"\"Uh!\" Wei Rufeng grunted and stumbled back a few steps. He angrily looked up and saw a beam of light shooting towards him.It was sword radiance!The sharpest and fiercest sword radiance ever!Right after it appeared, it had already reached Wei Rufeng.\"Divine Wind Kill!\"Wei Rufeng's blood instantly turned cold. Before he could parry with his saber, the radiance cut his abdomen.Puff!Wei Rufeng was sent flying, spewing blood everywhere.\"Ah!\"With a sad and shrill scream, he crashed down heavily.\"My elixir field... my cultivation!\" screamed Wei Rufeng desperately as he lay on the ground. His abdomen was cut wide open, and genuine Qi flooded out from his body.Standing aside, Su Mo put his sword away and coldly watched his opponent.If he had not withdrawn 80% of his power for the last move, Divine Wind Kill, Wei Rufeng would have died.There was a deathly hush in the martial practice field.Everyone stared at Su Mo. They had no idea that he could beat Wei Rufeng so decisively with his cultivation at the Peak Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.Su Mo's words echoed through people's minds, \"I have yet to compete!\"\"How can you know Wei Rufeng is the champion before our fight?\"It seemed that Su Mo was not arrogant, and he actually had the ability.\"Rufeng!\" A roar suddenly came from the spectators stand, shocking everybody.Wei Wankong instantly landed in front of Wei Rufeng. When he saw that his son's elixir field was broken and his cultivation was banished, he began to tremble violently.\"Bastard! You're asking to die!\"With blood-red eyes, Wei Wankon swung his palm at Su Mo.A huge and terrifying palm-print arrived in front of Su Mo within a second.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had two sons. Wei Lin, the younger son, had become a waste three months ago when Su Mo destroyed his elixir field. Now, Wei Rufeng, his talented elder son, whom he had great expectations for, also lost his cultivation because of Su Mo. How could he not lose his mind? Wei Wankong's eyes turned red, and he intended to kill Su Mo in one move. His huge palm print, coupled with intense killing desire, rushed toward Su Mo. Su Mo felt trapped by the overbearing momentum of the palm print, so he could not dodge it. Wei Wankong's cultivation was the Peak Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm, so he was more than ten times stronger than Su Mo. Just before the palm print struck Su Mo, Su Hong flew into the fighting ring and stood before him. \"Wei Wankong, you're asking to die!\" yelled Su Hong angrily. He punched back with his scorching fist, shattering the palm print into pieces. Without losing its impact, his punch directly blew Wei Wankong out of the fighting ring. \"Pfft!\" Wei Wankong spat out a mouthful of blood and fell down to the ground. He looked at Su Hong in shock and asked, \"Su Hong, have you broken into Lv 5 Spiritual Martial Realm?\" With his eyes full of killing desire, Su Hong coldly said, \"Yes. If you're asking to die, then I don't mind killing you right here, right now.\" \"You...\" Wei Wankong's face became livid, and he desperately wanted to kill Su Mo, but he could only swallow his grievances. After all, he had never expected Su Hong to reach Level Five of the Spiritual Martial Realm. Now, he was no match for Su Hong at all. Taking a deep breath, Wei Wankong tried his best to calm down and ordered his subordinates to carry Wei Rufeng out of the fighting ring. He planned to avenge his sons and himself in the future. The crowd was also stunned by Su Hong's powerful ability. Su Yue, the first elder of the Sus, felt a mixture of complex emotions. Before, he was just as powerful as Su Hong and had a genius son. In his view, he could have gradually undermined Su Hong's authority in the family and eventually replaced his status. The cruel reality was that Su Yu could not defeat Su Mo, and Su Hong had become much more powerful than him. The city governor, Lin Sheng, lightly frowned and thought, \"The Su family is becoming too powerful now!\" \"Su Mo won!\" exclaimed Lin De, looking at Su Mo in confusion.\u00a0 He then fixed his eyes on Lin Qiong and asked, \"Miss, do you still want to fight Su Mo?\" Based on the rules, Lin Qiong and Su Mo had to fight before the top three could be decided. However, Lin Qiong had been defeated by Wei Rufeng, who had been defeated by Su Mo. Su Mo was insanely powerful, so there was no doubt that he was the champion. That was why Lin De asked Lin Qiong if she still wanted to fight. Lin Qiong had mixed feelings toward Su Mo. She had never thought of him as a threat and had wanted to avenge her younger brother in the battle. Unexpectedly, Su Mo was much more powerful than her. \"I give up!\" Lin Qiong gritted her teeth and said in dismay. Lin De nodded his head. He had guessed she would give up. \"Now, I'll announce this competition's results.\" Lin De looked around and announced, \"In first place is Su Mo, second place is Wei Rufeng, and third place is Lin Qiong.\" As soon as he finished talking, the crowd burst into cheers. Many young girls even screamed towards the fighting ring to show their affection. \"Brother Su Mo! Congratulations!\" Xi'er also walked into the fighting ring and congratulated him with a smile. \"Haha!\" Su Mo burst into laughter and lightly tapped her on her nose. The sight of the young boy and girl laughing together amazed everyone. A genius young man and a stunning beauty were such an envious couple. The city governor, Lin Sheng, handed out the rewards. As the champion, Su Mo received an Energy-boosting Elixir and a precious 100-year red sage. Wei Rufeng and Lin Qiong also received big rewards. However, now that Wei Rufeng was a waste, the rewards were useless for him. \"Now, the martial arts competition is over,\" Lin Sheng stood up and said.\u00a0 Everyone got up and prepared to leave. In the fighting ring, Su Mo smiled and was about to leave with Xi'er, when something unexpected suddenly happened. The tranquil sky suddenly filled with surging clouds and roaring wind. \"Crack!\" A sound like that of a mirror breaking was heard. Suddenly, to everyone's disbelief, a crack appeared in the sky. The crack gradually expanded to ten meters long. Inside the crack lay empty and bottomless darkness. Everyone stared at the sky in shock. \"What's going on?\" \"Why is there a 10-meter-long crack in the sky?\" \"Is the sky broken?\" Everyone was startled, for they had never seen such a sight in their life before. At the moment, their eyes widened again. They fixed their eyes on the sky, and their hearts tightened with shock. Two people walked out of the huge crack. One was a thin old man in a gray robe, and the other was a handsome young man in an expensive robe. As they stepped out of the crack, an eerie aura instantly enveloped the entire city. Everyone was frozen in fear of this formidable air, and their hearts were about to beat out of their chests. After stepping out of the crack, the men overlooked the crowd with sharp gazes. Their shocking eyes made everyone shiver. \"Both of them are very powerful!\" Even Su Mo felt suffocated by their gaze. Fortunately, they only glimpsed at him. They quickly fixed their eyes on Xi'er, who was next to Su Mo. Out of the blue, they retracted their aura, and their eyes softened. The thin old man showed a hint of joy. The handsome youth revealed a trace of surprise. \"Milady, we have finally found you!\" exclaimed the old man. They stepped out of the sky, and landed in the fighting ring. \"Milady?\" Su Mo's eyes were frozen, and his heart skipped a beat. Xi'er lightly arched her brows and looked at the old man in confusion. The old man smiled and gently explained to her, \"You're the daughter of the master of Emperor Xuan Palace, but our master has lost you for many years. Now, we're going to take you back.\" The old man was the 13th Elder of Emperor Xuan Palace and had been ordered to bring Xi'er back to Emperor Xuan Palace. \"Emperor Xuan Palace?\" Everyone was surprised. Although they had never heard of Emperor Xuan Palace, they all knew that these two men must be extremely powerful. \"How can you be sure that I'm your master's daughter?\" asked Xi'er nervously. Although she asked this, deep down, she believed his words. Few people knew that she was an orphan. Besides, the jade pendant she had worn for her entire life had \"Xuan\" written on it. \"Milady, over a decade ago, when our master was fighting for the throne of Emperor Xuan Palace, you were just a baby. In order to control our master, his rivals wanted to hold you captive. Luckily, our subordinates protected you and took you away, but we eventually lost track of you.\" The 13th Elder was very patient and continued to explain, \"You can't awaken your Martial Soul, can you? That's because your Martial Soul is sealed inside your body. Did you try awakening your Martial Soul several days ago? We sensed activity in your Martial Soul, which is how we found you.\" \"Junior Sister, please follow us back to Central Continent. You don't have to stay in this remote place any longer!\" said the handsome youth with a smile. He was Shangguan Hao, a pro-disciple of the master of Emperor Xuan Palace, so he called Xi'er his Junior Sister. He was astonished by Xi'er's flawless beauty. Even as the son of the saint of Emperor Xuan Palace, he had never seen such a beautiful girl in the entire Central Continent. Hearing this, Xi'er lightly arched her brows and felt anXi'erous in her heart. After glancing at Su Mo, she firmly said, \"Sorry, I won't follow you. I'm quite happy here.\" The 13th Elder and Shangguan Hao were stunned, and then they saw that Xi'er and the young man next to her were tightly holding hands. Instantly, Shangguan Hao's face darkened, and he intended to kill Su Mo. \"Junior Sister, you don't want to go back because of this peasant?\" Shangguan Hao looked down upon Su Mo with eyes full of contempt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I won't allow you to talk about my Brother Su Mo like that.\"Xi'er felt furious. Anyone that insulted Su Mo made her upset.Shangguan Hao lifted his eyebrows as he never thought that Xi'er cared about this native so much.\"Lady, our master orders us to take you back no matter what happens,\" said the 13th Elder. Since the master made such an order, he would bring Xi'er back even against her will.\"Brother Su Mo!\"Xi'er anxiously looked at Su Mo.\"Xi'er, don't worry!\"Su Mo patted her on her hands and said, \"As long as I'm here, nobody will take you away.\"Su Mo was very glad that Xi'er could find her biological parents. If she would like to accompany her parents, he would, of course, not stop her. However, since she was unwilling to go back, he would definitely protect her.\"As long as you're here? How dare you to promise that, you menial ant!\" shouted Shangguan Hao. Out of the blue, a rush of air burst out from his body and impacted Su Mo.\"Puff!\"With a mouthful of blood escaping his lips, Su Mo was flown backward and fell down on the ground heavily.\"Brother Su Mo!\" Xi'er was shocked and held him up hurriedly.\"Mo'er!\"Su Hong was furious and, staring at Shangguan Hao with his eyes full of anger, he yelled, \"What do you mean?\"\"You're not qualified to talk to me!\"Without looking at Su Hong, Shangguan Hao just waved his robe, and then Su Hong felt his body being hit by such a great force that he was pushed back several steps with a trace of blood on the corner of his lip.\"What?\"Su Hong was extremely shocked.\"How is this possible?\"The young man looked only 16 or 17 years old, but with just a wave, he had hurt Su Hong and shocked him backward.The arrogant, bully and domineering Shangguan Hao had, in his eyes, a very high status that deprived Su Hong and other people of the qualifications to talk to him.Su Mo clenched his fists tightly and felt absolutely furious that Shangguan Hao was so unscrupulous and overwhelming.But he did not impulsively move to fight against Shangguan Hao, for he was not his match at all and would end up as a big failure.Besides, a more powerful elder was standing next to him.\"Well, son of the saint, don't waste time. The master is waiting for us!\" said the 13th Elder to Shangguan Hao. Then, he instantly looked at Xi'er and said, \"Lady, with all due respect, we have to return to Emperor Xuan Palace.\"Then the 13th Elder waved his hand, creating a strong wind that brought Xi'er back to his side.\"Xi'er!\" Su Mo was stunned. As soon as he wanted to try and help her, his body was shocked by a formidable momentum as if a mountain was on his back and he could no longer move.\"Let me go! Let me go!\"Xi'er furiously screamed, but she could not free herself from her bonds.\"Lady, what the hell do you want to do?\" asked the 13th Elder with his face darkened. If she were not the master's daughter, he would have directly taken her away regardless of her will.\"Leave me alone, and I want to be with brother Su Mo,\" yelled Xi'er.The 13th Elder frowned, glanced at Su Mo and said with his head shaking, \"You two will never be together.\"\"Why not?\" asked Xi'er.\"Because you two will be in totally different worlds.\"The 13th Elder indifferently continued, \"He's a commoner, just like a carp that lives in a small lake forever. He'll never have the opportunity to see the outside world. But after returning to Emperor Xuan Palace, you'll become a bird, flying in the sky at your will, and your road will become wider. Do you understand?\"The farthest distance in the world was the distance between a bird and fish.Xi'er was in a daze, but then she firmly shook her head and said, \"I don't need to understand, and all I want is to be with Brother Su Mo.\"Su Mo was touched upon hearing Xi'er's words of such deep feelings for him.The 13th Elder's said with his darkened face, \"Lady, I persuade you to forget him! If the master knows this, he'll destroy not only him, but also his clan.\"Xi'er completely was completely stunned.The color seemed uncertain on Su Mo's face. After a while, he said to Xi'er suddenly, \"Xi'er, go with them!\"\"Brother Su Mo!\" Xi'er was shocked and looked at him with confusion.\"Xi'er, he's right. You can practice your martial arts better only after you go back with them. I'll go to the Central Continent to look for you later!\" said Su Mo seriously.Su Mo had thought it through that it was not bad for Xi'er to go back with them. Instead, she would obtain a better start on the road of martial arts.More importantly, he knew that those two would take Xi'er away anyway and he could not block them.That was because he could not match them.Su Mo tightly clenched his hands together as he was desperately eager for power at this moment.Speechless, she had tears welling up in her eyes.\"Don't be ridiculous. You'll never go to the Central Continent for the rest of your life and you'll never see my sister again.\"Shangguan Hao smiled scornfully and his words were full of thick ridicule.When he stared at the young man in the brocade\u00a0robe, Su Mo's eyes were filled with a frozen chill and a killing thought arose from his heart.\"It's not your business whether I can go to the Central Continent or I can see Xi'er or not,\" said Su Mo coldly.\"You're asking to die! How dare you talk to me like that! Do you know my status?\" yelled Shangguan Hao coldly with his eyes full of a burning desire to kill.\"Your status? Don't you come from Emperor Xuan Palace?\" asked Su Mo.\"Haha! Do you know what Emperor Xuan Palace stands for?\"After scornfully laughing, he said full of arrogance, \"I'll tell you what Emperor Xuan Palace represents. Emperor Xuan Palace's power is beyond your imagination, you'll never get close to it in your entire life! It can also decide on the life or death of millions of people in a second.\"Now you know the distance between you and me\u2014you lowly ant!\"Shangguan Hao lifted his head and looked at Su Mo with his eyes full of bold contempt.Su Mo tightly frowned, felt furious at his contempt, and said coldly, \"You keep calling me a menial ant. Now, as powerful as you are, what realm have you achieved?\"\"Haha!\"Shangguan Hao laughed condescendingly and replied, \"My cultivation is what you'll have been eager for your whole life.\"\"That I've been eager for my whole life?\"Su Mo disdainfully shook his head and said with surprise, \"Since you're so confident, let's see how long you can keep me looking up to you. It'll take me 10 years, no, only five years to exceed you. I'll challenge you in five years.\"The crowd became instantly silent at his words and all looked at him in surprise.Even Su Hong felt shocked at his son.\"What? You should challenge me in five years?\"Shangguan Hao was stunned, then he disdainfully laughed and shook his head, speechless. Then he said, \"You still don't get it. You're like the frog in the well, which is so sad!\"Then Shangguan Hao continued, \"I accept your challenge and wait for you at any time. By the way, my name is Shangguan Hao.\"Shangguan Hao said those words jokingly, he did not take the words seriously.\"Is it possible for a menial nonentity to surpass me in five years?\"\"Of course, it's impossible.Su Mo ignored him, looked at the elder who was in a grey robe, and said, \"Elder, you've said just now that Xi'er will become a bird in the sky while I'm only a carp in a small lake. I admit that it's a good and appropriate metaphor.\"The crowd felt astonished at his words and thought that Su Mo had straightened out his thinking.The 13th Elder lifted his eyebrows at his words, then felt puzzled and thought, \"Did he suddenly become reasonable?\"But right at that moment, Su Mo suddenly shifted the topic, \"But I want to remind you that even a carp can pass a dragon gate and transform into a dragon. How can you be sure that I won't become a powerful man just like you?\"Su Mo pronounced his words one by one as if the lofty ambition of a young man became true and then soared into the sky.\"The carp leaps through the dragon's gate?\"\"A carp transforms into a dragon?\"The 13th Elder felt surprised at Su Mo's exciting words, then he shook his head. After glancing at Su Mo again, he said with a stony face, \"Son, you're too naive. The carp leaps through the dragon's gate? A carp transforms into a dragon? These are the fantasies of the weak.\"The 13th Elder felt amused in his heart and thought, \"This young man has a great but unrealistic ambition!\"\"I'll make it in five years,\" said Su Mo with determination.\"I'll make it in five years,\" said Su Mo with determination.The 13th Elder smiled, took his words as a joke, and said to Shangguan Hao, \"Son of the saint, let's go.\"\"Yeah!\"Shangguan Hao nodded, looked at Su Mo, and coldly said, \"A carp will remain a carp forever and never become a dragon.\"Then together with Xi'er, they flew directly into the sky.\"Brother Su Mo, I like you!\"Xi'er abruptly shouted with her beautiful eyes full of tears.Su Mo's heart suddenly beat, for this was the first time that Xi'er told Su Mo her feelings towards him.\"Xi'er, wait for me!\"Su Mo yelled back when seeing her figure gradually disappear in the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just want to be with Brother Su Mo.\"\"Brother Su Mo, I like you!\"After a while, Xi'er's words still lingered in his ears.Su Mo felt bitter in his heart. He was incompetent in protecting Xi'er, whom he liked very much.\"Mo'er, let's go back!\"Su Hong patted him on his shoulder and consoled him. \"I believe that you'll eventually see Xi'er again one day.\"Hearing Su Hong's words, Su Mo recovered, inhaled a deep breath, and firmly said, \"In five years, I'll bring Xi'er back. More importantly, I'll keep Shangguan Hao under my foot forever.\"\"I trust you!\" Su Hong deeply nodded his head and comforted Su Mo.Then, they left the Mansion of the City Governor and returned to the Su's.As the spectators left, what had happened in the martial arts competition had been spread over the entire Sunnywood City.Su Mo, out of all expectations, had defeated Wei Rufeng of the Wei clan and become the champion in the martial arts competition.When the competition was just over, two powerful and mysterious men had come to the Mansion of the City Governor and taken that timeless beauty away.Su Mo had made a five-year engagement with the youth that he would challenge him in five years.In a word, after the martial arts competition, Su Mo had completely become the man of the hour and the first genius in Sunnywood City.Regardless of what was happening outside, Su Mo sat cross-legged in his room and swallowed the Energy-boosting Elixir that he had gotten in the martial arts competition.No wonder Energy-boosting Elixir was in the Upper Lv 1, for tremendous efficacy was hidden inside.The elixir was transformed into pure energy and spread over his entire body the minute he swallowed it.Su Mo activated the cultivation method, which led the energy to flow smoothly through his meridians. Finally, the energy ended up in his elixir field.As the efficacy took effect, the genuine Qi inside his body was quickly multiplied. One hour later, he smoothly smashed through the barrier in cultivation.He was promoted to the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.Afterward, Su Mo also ate the 100-year red sage.The 100-year red sage was also in the Upper Lv 1, but it was not as powerful as the Energy-boosting Elixir in efficacy. However, it could not only improve his cultivation but also complement his Qi blood.With the help of the red sage, Su Mo reached the middle stage of the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.Over the following days, Su Mo was immersed in cultivating each day.His cultivation progressed steadily. Besides, he also made progress in swordplay and footwork day after day. His Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist achieved the Great Completion Realm.The only thing that Su Mo had faith in was that he must go to Central Continent in five years to find Xi'er.Nobody could stop him, even though he did not know where Central Continent was or how far away it was.Time flew by. A half month passed in the blink of an eye. The lunar new year was just around the corner.In the Master's yard, Su Mo and Su Hong sat at the table, which was filled with delicious food. Apparently, they were enjoying the family reunion dinner.Speaking of which, the family had only two members.Su Mo's mother had died at an early age and Su Hong did not have any siblings. Such being the case, only Su Mo and Su Hong enjoyed the family reunion dinner each year.\"Mo'er, do you have a plan for the new year?\" asked Su Hong.\"Dad, I'm planning to go out and get experience for myself!\" replied Su Mo. Based on his ability, he was peerless among all the young inferiors in Sunnywood City.Moreover, the higher his realm progressed into, the slower his cultivating speed became, so it was time to get himself some practice outside of Sunnywood City.\"In one month, the four sects in Skymoon Country will recruit new disciples. You can give that a try.\"Su Hong sighed, and then continued, \"But the four sects have high requirements on the levels of their disciples' Martial Souls. Their bottom line is a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul. You're highly talented, but your Martial Soul is too low. Although there isn't much hope, you still have an opportunity.\"Su Hong greatly hoped that his son could be recruited by one of the four sects. But he felt also hopeless about Su Mo's Martial Soul being too low.\"Dad, my Martial Soul isn't at Rank 1 Human Class.\"After some thought, Su Mo decided to tell him the truth.\"What? Not at Rank 1 Human Class?\"Su Hong was stunned in confusion. Though he had not been at the scene, many elders and inferiors had witnessed Su Mo awaken a Martial Soul of Rank 1 Human Class. Thus, it could not be wrong.\"That's right, dad. Look!\"Su Mo smiled and let out his Martial Soul.The black Devouring Martial Spirit suspended in the air with six shining yellow light rings around it.Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul!\"What? Six yellow light rings?\"Su Hong was shocked.Su Mo pulled back his Martial Soul. After a while, Su Hong recovered.\"Mo'er, your Martial Soul is at the Rank 6 Human Class now! No wonder you can cultivate so quickly!\"Su Hong was overjoyed and excited, thinking, \"A Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul is very rare. Sunnywood City hasn't seen one for decades.\"He did not know how Su Mo's Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul had progressed to be at the Rank 6 Human Class, but it did not matter anymore.\"Haha! Dad, due to my talent, I'll have no difficulties being recruited by any Sect,\" said Su Mo confidently.\"Haha, you bet. A Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul is good enough for you to enter any Sect.\"Su Hong laughed, then asked, \"Which Sect do you plan on entering?\"\"Dad, what are the differences among the four sects?\" asked Su Mo.After some thought, Su Hong explained, \"The four sects are the Sky Rapier Sect, the Scorching Sun Sect, Gale Island, and the Sky Yuan Sect. Among them, the Sky Rapier Sect is the most powerful one and the other three are at the same level. Thus, if you want to join in a Sect, the Sky Rapier Sect is the best choice.\"\"The Sky Rapier Sect?\" Su Mo meditated on that.\"Yeah. The Sky Rapier Sect is famous for its swordplay and over 90% of its disciples cultivate swordplay. Since you're used to swords, the Sky Rapier Sect is your top choice.\"\"Yeah!\"Su Mo nodded his head. At the present, the Sky Rapier Sect was the most well-matched with him.Time flew by. Several days passed.On this day, Su Mo was practicing in his room. \"Dong, dong...!\" Knocking sounds broke out.Su Mo stood up, opened the door, and found a servant and a pretty lady standing before him.Su Mo had met this lady before. It was the maid of Purple Gold Pavilion herself.\"Young master, This is Lady Yue from Purple Gold Pavilion, who asks to see you,\" said the servant respectfully as he paid homage to Su Mo.Su Mo lightly arched his brows, wondering why the maid had asked to see him, and then asked, \"Why do you want to see me?\"\"Young master Su, our leader dispatches me to invite you to the Pavilion,\" she gently said, staring at Su Mo with her bright eyes.Her eyes were full of mixed feelings, including fear, admiration, and shyness. She was curious about the first genius of Sunnywood City.\"Your leader wants to see me?\"Su Mo felt somewhat surprised. Aside from twice trading Beast Souls, he had no relationship with the leader of Pavilion, Luo Huan. But why did she want to see him?\"Alright! Show me the way!\"After some thoughts, Su Mo decided to meet Luo Huan and figure out why she had asked to meet him.Then, Su Mo followed the maid and walked toward Purple Gold Pavilion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was wearing a light red dress that made her elegant, decent, and less inviting.\"Leader Luo, why did you request to see me?\" Su Mo asked after they were seated, trying his best to not look at her.\"Young Master Su, I'd like to ask you something,\" said Luo Huan gently with a chuckle.\"Please go ahead.\" Su Mo nodded his head.\"Come on! Young Master Su, why not call me Sister Luo like I told you last time?\" said Luo Huan coquettishly with an attractive smile on her face while rolling her eyes at Su Mo.\"Er...\"Su Mo shook his body for he could not tolerate her posture. He anxiously took a deep breath and said, \"Sister Luo, please.\"\"Hoho! That's right!\"Luo Huan smiled, pursed her lips and asked, \"The four Sects in Skymoon Country will soon recruit new disciples. Does Young Master Su want to go?\"Su Mo was in a daze and wondered why she asked him about this, for whether he went or not had nothing to do with her.After some thought, Su Mo told her the truth. \"I'll go and participate in the test.\"As Luo Huan was not surprised by his words, she nodded her head and again asked, \"Which Sect does Young Master Su want to join?\"After saying those words, Luo Huan smiled and stared at Su Mo with her bright eyes.Su Mo furrowed his brows, knowing that she asked him with a purpose, so he said with a smile, \"Sister Luo, please get to the point!\"Luo Huan gave him an inviting smile and said, \"Since you said so, I won't beat around the bush.\"Luo Huan handed a letter to Su Mo and said, \"Young Master Su, please read this.\"Su Mo was confused, then found that it was a recommendation for him.In this letter, Su Mo was recommended to Gale Island.Luo Huan smiled at Su Mo's surprising look and said, \"Young Master Su, you may probably not know that Purple Gold Pavilion is affiliated with Gale Island. Based on this recommendation, you can directly become an Outer Disciple without attending the threshold test.\"\"Does Gale Island own Purple Gold Pavilion?\"Su Mo suddenly understood. No wonder Purple Gold Pavilion was very reputable, cause Gale Island was behind it.\"You're right!\"Luo Huan lightly nodded her head and said, \"If Young Master Su wants to join a Sect, I hope you can join Gale Island. Among the four Sects, Gale Island isn't the most powerful but it is the most resourceful. Since Purple Gold Pavilion has branches over the entire Skymoon Country, countless resources are transported into the island every day.\"In a word, Gale Island is your best choice.\"\"Oh?\"Su Mo's eyes flashed with a hint of light, then he asked in confusion, \"Sister Luo, why do you value me so much, even writing a recommendation for me yourself? Although my talent isn't bad in Sunnywood City, it means nothing in the entire Skymoon Country.\"Su Mo felt a little strange. Like he had said, his talent was ranked as the top one in Sunnywood City, but many people in Skymoon Country were endowed with higher talents than him.Furthermore, almost everyone knew that his Martial Soul was at the Rank 1 Human Class, which meant that his Martial Soul was totally useless.Under such circumstances, Luo Huan wrote a recommendation for Su Mo which could directly help him become an Outer Disciple of Gale Island, which made him feel even more puzzled.\"Don't kid with me. Even though your cultivation was at the Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, you defeated a martial artist at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, which is a rare talent in the whole Skymoon Country.\"Luo Huan smiled and continued. \"In addition to making money for Gale Island, our pavilion is also responsible for selecting good disciples. I can sense you're different, so I hope you can join Gale Island.\"Su Mo nodded his head and knew that her words made sense.However, Su Mo lowered his head to meditate instead of answering her right away.Upon seeing his look, Luo Huan's eyes became gentler and she seductively said, \"As long as Young Master Su promises to join Gale Island, I'll give you a present.\"\"A present?\"Su Mo was surprised and thought, \"If I promise to join Gale Island, I'll directly be an Outer Disciple and receive a present. What a good trade!\"Without asking about the present, Su Mo made a decision after some meditation.The four Sects were no different to Su Mo and he was okay with joining any Sect. If he wanted to be a powerful martial artist, he needed to take the initiative to practice himself.Since Luo Huan had sincerely invited him, he decided to join Gale Island.\"OK! I promise you that I'll join Gale Island.\"Su Mo thought for a while before making the promise.\"Hoho! I'm very happy to deal with you. In that case, here is the present.\"Luo Huan took out a storage pouch and handed it to Su Mo.Su Mo was instantly overjoyed the minute he opened it.There were 100 Soul Crystals in it. Judging from their soul Qi, he was sure that they were all Beast Souls of demonic beasts at Class 9 Lv 1.100 Beast Souls of demonic beasts at Class 9 Lv 1 were worth of 40,000 taels of gold. Su Mo was surprised by Luo Huan's generosity.After seeing Su Mo's joyful expression, Luo Huan smiled.Su Mo had bought a large number of Beast Souls twice from this place, so she chose Beast Souls as the present from her judgment that Beast Souls were of great use to Su Mo.\"Sister Luo, thanks for your bountiful gifts. Someday, I will surely repay you.\" Su Mo bowed to Luo Huan in thanks.\"Hoho! How will Young Master Su pay me back?\" Luo Huan chuckled and revealed an unspeakable expression.\"Er!\"Su Mo was almost under her spell and thought, \"She really is a fairy!\"Having chatted with her for a while, Su Mo left Purple Gold Pavilion with a bow.At the mansion of the Su clan, Su Mo saw three people standing before his door from a distance as he was approaching his yard.\"What are they doing there?\"Su Mo was confused. The three people were Su Tianhao, Su Hai, and Su Yu.\"Su Mo!\"At this moment, they also saw Su Mo.\"What's wrong?\" Su Mo walked forward and confusedly asked.\"Su Mo, in several days, Su Hai and I, along with Su Yu and other disciples, will go back to the Sky Yuan Sect. They'll participate in the threshold test of our Sect. Do you want to go with us?\" asked Su Tianhao.As the most powerful one among all the inferiors, Su Tianhao was very arrogant and had almost never talked to Su Mo before.But since the martial arts competition in Sunnywood City, he had greatly changed his attitude toward Su Mo and was not like he had been before.\"Yes! Su Mo, you can go with us!\" said Su Hai.Like Su Tianhao, Su Hai had also changed his attitude toward Su Mo. He did not dare to belittle Su Mo anymore.Su Yu did not say anything and he was embarrassed, for he had a bad relationship with Su Mo before.\"You go! I'm not planning to go to the Sky Yuan Sect.\"Su Mo shook his head and continued. \"I'm going to Gale Island.\"\"Gale Island?\"They were all in a daze and then nodded their heads in unison.They did not ask any more questions. Now that the four Sects had the same strength, joining any Sect made no difference.Moreover, due to the fact that they did not have good relationships with Su Mo, they were embarrassed to say anything more since Su Mo had made up his mind to go to Gale Island.Then, they left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, his Martial Soul still had not made a progression.\"F*ck!\"Su Mo could not help but say a dirty word.As the level of his Martial Soul upgraded, it became more and more difficult to make a progression. He had devoured many Beast Souls and Martial Souls in Breezewind Mountain before, and now he devoured so many Beast Souls once more, but his Martial Soul still could not make a progression.\"Alas!\"Su Mo sighed, and he stopped stressing about it. He believed that as long as he kept devouring Beast Souls and Martial Souls, his Martial Soul would make a progression sooner or later.When one was cultivating, time always flew by. Another five days passed.Once his Elephant's Strength Skill had gotten to the late stage of the third realm, he had the strength of nine tigers, which was equal to the strength of a martial artist at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. He walked out of his room.It was in half a month that Gale Island would recruit disciples.It was time to leave!He came to his father's residence and told his father what he thought.\"Mo'er, it is a long journey to Gale Island. Let me order someone to take you!\" Su Hong said.\"No, father, I'll do it alone!\"Su Mo rejected his father's advice.\"Father, here are three scrolls. Take them!\"Su Mo handed the Primordial Qi Manual, Divine Wind Swordplay, and Shadow Steps to his father and said, \"I found these three manuals accidentally. They're very powerful and far beyond the martial arts of our Su clan. If you learn them, your strength will be more powerful.\"Looking at the scrolls in his hands, Su Hong was quite shocked by their levels, but he nodded without asking.\"Father, I'm leaving!\" Outside the gate of Sunnywood City, Su Mo looked at Su Hong and said while leading a cyan-maned horse.\"Mo'er, be careful on your way,\" Su Hong said.\"Well, father, go back!\"Su Mo mounted the horse, once again looked back at Sunnywood City, and then immediately flicked the reins. The cyan-maned horse ran away like raging wind and a flash of lightning.Su Mo carried the longsword and rode the horse all over the world.Looking at the endless earth, Su Mo was full of excitement and in a high heroic spirit.The dream of being a martial artist that he had during his previous life came to his mind.It was always in Jianghu that a man could get his romance. (Jianghu is typically used to mean people who live in a world parallel to conventional society, one that operates by its own laws and code of ethics.)He needed to be a strong person during this life.If he could wear good clothes, ride a steed, drink wine, be accompanied by beauties, sing while wielding a sword, overrun the whole world, and go anywhere as he pleased, there would be no regrets during his second life.It was said that, as a kind of high-quality breed, the cyan-maned horse had a demonic beast heritage and could run 500 km in the day and 400 km at night.Clack! Clack! Clack!On the galloping horse, Su Mo gradually rode away from Sunnywood City.\"Whoa!\"When he was about 50 km away, Su Mo suddenly drew the reins and stopped.A tall figure suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his way.That person was in a gray robe with his back to him. Squinting his eyes, Su Mo closely stared at him.That man must not be here to show kindness.\"Su Mo, today you'll die!\"A husky voice arose, and that person turned around. He was a middle-aged man with a gloomy face.\"You are... Wei Guang?\"Looking him up and down, Su Mo felt that he was familiar, and he immediately thought that he was the elder of the Wei clan, Wei Guang.\"Yes, I am.\"Wei Guang sneered with a wisp of killing desire in his eyes and said, \"Su Mo, you killed Wei Liang, and you destroyed two young masters of the Wei clan, so only with your blood can revenge be taken.\"After saying that, Wei Guang gathered all of his momentum, and then rushed out and swept his palm to attack Su Mo.As a strong martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm, Wei Guang swept his palm at a very fast speed, and the shape of the palm made up of Genuine Qi split the air and moved toward Su Mo.Clang!In the face of the extremely dangerous situation, Su Mo was not in a panic. He flew up and cut with his sword.Whoosh!After a bright light flashed, the shape of the palm made up of Genuine Qi was divided into two and fragmented.\"Hmm? Your power is strong, but you still will die!\"Wei Guang raised his eyebrows and then attacked again.\"You're not able to kill me,\" Su Mo indifferently said, calm in the face of disaster.\"You're so arrogant!\"Shouting with anger, Wei Guang continuously swept his palm. The shapes of the palm made up of Genuine Qi, which had a momentum of shaking the sky, looked like mountains and moved toward Su Mo one by one.When a martial artist was at the Spiritual Martial Realm, his Genuine Qi would have been transformed into Congenital Genuine Qi, and his Genuine Qi could leave his body and kill enemies without touching them. It would work within 100 steps.A martial artist of the Qi Cultivation Realm could barely make his Genuine Qi leave his body, but it worked within 10 steps. At more than 10 steps, its attack power would be greatly reduced.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"The raging wind was blowing and the sword radiance was flashing. The shapes of the palm were broken one by one and dissipated with the wind.\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"As the wind was roaring, the longsword changed into a bright light to stab Wei Guang.\"You're asking to die!\"Without making a dodge, Wei Guang stretched his palm and slapped on the sword to beat it away.In the meantime, Wei Guang made a lightning attack toward Su Mo's head with his left palm.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist!\"With his ninefold fist force spewing out, Su Mo punched Wei Guang's palm with his left fist.Boom!After a crack, Su Mo made a sound in his chest and flew back.\"A martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm is really powerful!\" Su Mo thought in his heart.However, in the next second, Su Mo shook his longsword, his eyes flashing a wisp of bright light. With the Sword Qi filling the sky and the wind covering his sword, Su Mo attacked Wei Guang with his sword once again.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"The sharp sword radiance split the space and mixed with the wind to destroy everything.\"Kill!\"Seeing that Su Mo was so powerful, Wei Guang swept his palm a few meters away with a stronger killing desire in his eyes. A giant shape of the palm appeared with a great momentum.\"Sky-splitting Palm!\"Boom! Boom! Boom!When the sword radiance dissipated and the shape of the palm was broken, Su Mo made a sound in his chest and flew back again, and his mouth spat out a stream of blood.However, in the next moment, Su Mo quickly turned around and flew away.He knew that it was impossible to defeat Wei Guang, so he left without hesitation.\"Boy, you have nowhere to escape to!\"Wei Guang loudly shouted and quickly ran after him. His figure looked like a great hawk spreading its wings.Wei Guang felt shocked in his heart. At just the peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, Su Mo was able to fight him, which was unexpected to him. With such an excellent talent, if someday Su Mo became more powerful, there would not be a place for the Wei clan in Sunnywood City.Actually, Wei Guang's cultivation was not at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, but at Lv 2.He thought that it would have been very easy for him to kill Su Mo. However, the improvement of Su Mo's abilities was beyond his expectation.So, today he had to kill Su Mo.Su Mo ran Shadow Steps to the extreme. In the next moment, he looked like a leopard and he could be 10 meters away with one step. His speed was incredible.However, as a Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist, Wei Guang was not worse than Su Mo. He kept following him, even though the martial arts technique that he cultivated for speed was worse than what Su Mo cultivated.\"Su Mo, it'll be impossible for you to escape!\"The angry shout of Wei Guang came from behind him.Su Mo sneered, improved his speed once again, and entered the roadside woods.Su Mo's speed was greatly limited by the woods, but so was Wei Guang's.In the dense woods, with big trees and brambles as his cover, Su Mo constantly changed his direction. Before long, Wei Guang lost his trace.\"Bastard!\"Wei Guang was in a rage. As a Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist, he could not catch up to an inferior with the cultivation in the Qi Cultivation Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its area was more than 3,000 square kilometers and was almost one-fifth of the area of Skymoon Country.Star-water Lake had a great reputation in Skymoon Country, not only because of its large area but also because Gale Island, one of the four sects of Skymoon Country, was located here.There was a city named Waterside City that was located by the lake.Waterside City was an extremely prosperous city. People walked on the streets in an endless stream, and horses and carriages were everywhere.\"It is indeed a large city. Sunnywood City doesn't hold a candle to it!\"Walking on the street, Su Mo looked like a bumpkin stepping into the city because he was curiously looking here and there.Sunnywood City was only a small remote town with a population of about 300,000, while Waterside City was a large city with a population of more than two million. They could not be mentioned in the same breath.At this time, Su Mo was fatigued from his journey.After more than 10 days of travel, he finally arrived at Waterside City.Waterside City was the closest city to Gale Island. One could directly access Gale Island by ships at the wharf outside of the city.When Su Mo arrived at the wharf, hundreds of people were gathering there.People were surrounding a big wooden sign that was erected in the wharf and looking at something that was written on it.After stepping forward, Su Mo found that it was a notice board posted by Gale Island. The notice said that there would be a warship from Gale Island to pick up the disciples for the examination in the morning two days later.Su Mo understood that Gale Island made a unified arrangement because countless people came to take the examination.Then, Su Mo booked a room at an inn.After that, he sat in a window seat in the lobby and ordered some food. As he was eating, he was also listening to the discussions around him.The inn was called Greeting Guests Inn, which was luxuriously decorated.The business at the inn was very good. The lobby was full of guests, many of whom were boys and girls. Judging from their appearances, they also apparently came from afar to participate in the Gale Island examination.\"I heard that the standard of recruiting disciples in Gale Island was improved this year?\"\"Yes! When they recruited disciples in previous years, the minimum standard for a Martial Soul was Rank 4 Human Class, but this year it is Rank 5 Human Class!\"\"Compared to the previous years when they recruited 1,000 disciples each time, they are only recruiting 500 disciples this year. They would rather have quality over quantity, so the standards are naturally raised.\"Listening to the discussions around him, Su Mo could not help being surprised.A Martial Soul of the Rank 5 Human Class was rare to be seen in Sunnywood City over the past few decades. Now only Su Yu had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul among the young disciples in the city.However, a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul was just the minimum standard that Gale Island had set this year.Su Mo sighed that only the four sects of Skymoon Country could lay down such a criterion.At the same time, thinking that before long he could compete with numerous geniuses, Su Mo felt excited, and his blood boiled.Just then, two boys and a girl walked into the lobby. The moment they stepped into the inn, they attracted everyone's attention.The girl was in a blue dress, fair-skinned with an exquisite face, and was quite beautiful. One of the boys was in fine clothes, and thin, with a face that was full of pride.However, the young man among them was the most attractive one. He was about 15 or 16, handsome with deep eyes and, judging from the pure and powerful momentum he did not hide, Su Mo knew that he was a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm.Raising his eyebrows, Su Mo had to admire that his cultivation was in the Spiritual Martial Realm although the young man was roughly the same age as him.\"Brother Yan Qi, it seems there's no seat!\" the girl in the blue skirt said to the handsome boy in the middle after her eyes swept the lobby and found that it was full.\"It's easy, let's sit down over there.\"Seeing that Su Mo was sitting alone, the thin boy stepped toward Su Mo.The other two followed behind him and walked over.\"We're going to sit here. You can go sit with the others!\" said the thin boy with a commanding tone, coming over to Su Mo.Su Mo raised his head and glanced at him, but he completely ignored him and continued to drink.The thin teenager frowned and shouted, \"Boy, I'm talking to you! Didn't you hear me?\"Su Mo said with a trace of a smile on his face, \"Oh, what's up?\"I said go away, we're going to sit here.\"The thin teenager sank his face and was overbearing.\"I'm sorry, you'd better go sit with the others!\" Su Mo said indifferently, shaking his head.There were morons wherever you went. They were really arrogant to forcibly occupy another's seat.\"You... !\"He was stunned, but then said in a cold tone, \"Boy, your courage is impressive, but do you know who we are?\"\"What does it have to do with me?\"Su Mo raised his head and sneered.\"You're asking to die!\"He was enraged and then pointed at the handsome boy just walking up to him, saying, \"We're from the Yan clan in Purple-hill City, and he's our young master, Yan Qi.\"Once the young man said that, a commotion was caused in the lobby.\"He's actually Yan Qi, the young master of the Yan clan.\"\"The Yan clan the overlord in Purple-hill City. Besides, it is said that Yan Qi, the young master of the Yan clan, is a super genius with a Martial Soul of Rank 8 Human Class. He reached the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm when he was just 15.\"Hearing those words, the thin teenager raised his head higher with a proud face, as if people were talking about him.That handsome boy and the girl in blue were smiling.\"Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class?\"Su Mo fixed his eyes and felt quite surprised as he could not help glancing at the handsome junior.\"Now you know who we are? Get out of here!\" seeing the surprise in Su Mo's eyes, the thin teenager coldly shouted with a proud look.\"The Yan clan? Yan Qi? Never heard of them. I only heard a dog barking in front of me.\" Su Mo sneered.Now that they did not respect him, he would not be polite to them.\"You're asking to die!\"The thin boy and the girl in blue were enraged. They were going to beat Su Mo, but they were stopped by Yan Qi.Yan Qi said in a cold tone with light flashing in his eyes, \"Who are you? Why do you despise our clan?\"Yan Qi was not an idiot, as seeing that Su Mo was not afraid of them, he guessed Su Mo's identity. Su Mo probably had an impressive background now that he dared to despise the Yan clan.His clan was only the overlord of Purple-hill City. Several of the clans in Waterside City were not weaker than his clan.However, after looking Su Mo up and down, he found that Su Mo was a very ordinary person and had nothing special, so Su Mo should be a disciple of a small clan.\"If you want to gain the respect of others, you must learn to respect others first,\" Su Mo indifferently said, glancing at Yan Qi without answering his question.\"Respect?\"Yan Qi's eyes flashed a hint of mockery, then he sneered, \"Respect is based on power, do you have any?\"Su Mo fixed his eyes. Yan Qi's words sounded harsh, but it was true in this world.The strong could win others' respect, while the weak could only be bullied by others.\"Brother Yan Qi, he can never be forgiven for despising our clan.\"The girl in blue had a soft voice, but her words were full of killing desire.\"Yes, he is so arrogant that he despised our clan, which is unforgivable,\" the thin boy said with a gloomy face. Su Mo had called him a dog, which made him very angry.\"Yan Xing, destroy his cultivation, then let him go!\"Yan Qi nodded and said in a flat voice. It sounded like he was showing his mercy by destroying Su Mo's cultivation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were going to destroy Su Mo's cultivation just because he had offended them.Everyone sadly looked at Su Mo.Now that they had asked for those seats, he had better give them up. It was not worth having his cultivation destroyed just in order to show himself.However, just when the crowd was feeling sad about Su Mo, something strange happened.Crack!With a clear sound, Yan Xing felt a burning pain on his face before he could punch at Su Mo.A clear handprint appeared on his face.Yan Xing was stunned!The others were also stunned!\"Damn, you're courting death!\"When Yan Xing recovered, his face was livid and blood vessels appeared on his forehead. Yan Xing looked at Su Mo with a strong killing desire in his eyes.Su Mo had just given his face a solid slap.Yan Xing was furious. With Genuine Qi spewing around his fists, he was going to attack Su Mo once again.\"Stop it!\"Just then, a loud shout resounded like a big ringing bell, and a great momentum suddenly swept through the lobby.When people lifted their heads, they saw an old, solemn, and dignified man in a cyan gown walking down the stairs.\"If anyone dares to make trouble in Greeting Guests Inn, I'll cut off his limbs and destroyed his cultivation.\"The old man's voice was not loud, but to the others, it sounded like he was speaking right into their ears.Su Mo closely stared at the old man because the momentum he released was 10 times more powerful than his father's.\"Senior, I'm the young master of the Yan clan in Purple-hill City. He'll never be forgiven for disgracing our clan,\" Yan Qi said, pointing at Su Mo, after he had made an obeisance to the old man.\"The Yan clan in Purple-hill City?\"The old man squinted his eyes and looked them up and down, then indifferently said, \"The rules can't be broken, everyone is banned from fighting inside this inn. When you're out of the inn, whatever you do has nothing to do with me.\"Although the Yan clan was strong, the clan behind the old man was not weaker than it, so he was not afraid of the Yan clan.Yan Qi frowned, he did not expect that his clan's reputation would not work on the old man.After considering for a moment, Yan Qi glanced at Su Mo, then waved to the girl and boy, and said, \"Let's go!\"\"Er...\"Having reconciled himself to that result, Yan Xing looked at Su Mo with deep resentment.\"Let's go!\"Yan Qi shook his head, then strode out of the inn.Yan Xing and the girl in blue followed him. Although Yan Xing was unwilling to leave, he could do nothing.Outside the inn, Yan Xing asked Yan Qi, \"Brother Yan Qi, do we just let that guy go?\"\"Humph, we can't fight inside the inn, but he'll walk out of it eventually, so we can wait for him outside of the inn,\" the girl said with a cold smile.Yan Xing's eyes brightened after he heard that.\"Yan Lan, don't be troubled! He probably came here to participate in the examination of Gale Island. As long as he enters Gale Island, I have a hundred ways to deal with him.\"Yan Qi narrowed his eyes and a cold light flashed in his eyes.\"And if he doesn't pass the examination?\" Yan Xing asked.\"Humph! If he doesn't pass the examination, he'll not be a Gale Island disciple, then we can kill him on the spot,\" Yan Qi said.Yan Xing and the girl nodded, then they strode away.In the lobby, after they left, the old man in the cyan gown glanced at Su mo, then turned around and left.Sitting in his position and looking through the window, Su Mo saw those three people whispering. He could not hear what they were saying, but he knew that they were thinking of ways to deal with him.However, he was not afraid of them.After dinner, Su Mo went back to his room, sat cross-legged on the bed, and released his Devouring Martial Spirit to cultivate.Su Mo had been practicing to the later stage of Lv 3 of the Elephant's Strength Skill, and his strength was equivalent to the power of a martial artist at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Therefore, Su Mo decided to stop practicing Elephant's Strength Skill for now. Enhancing his Genuine Qi and cultivation was his first priority.Su Mo's cultivation had been at the peak of Lv 8 for some time, and he felt that his cultivation could step into Lv 9 before long.When he was cultivating, the time flew by. Two days had passed.In the early morning, after washing his face and having breakfast, Su Mo walked to the wharf outside the city.When he arrived at the pier, Su Mo was scared by the scene.The whole dock was full of people, and the din of their voice reached to the sky. If one had a bird's eye view of the dock, he would see nothing but heads.With a sweeping glance of the pier, Su Mo estimated that there were more than 10,000 people gathered there.Except for a few elders acting as escorts, the rest were all boys and girls. The oldest one was no more than 18 and the youngest was only 13 or 14.All their faces were youthful and they were excitedly talking to one another.Since Gale Island's ships had not arrived, Su Mo stood by the lake and enjoyed the surrounding scenery.About an hour later, 10 black spots appeared on the surface of the vast lake.Those black spots got larger and, impressively, they were 10 large warships.Each warship was 100 meters long with huge sails that were fluttering in the wind.The words \"Gale\" on the sails were written in elegant handwriting with vigorous strokes.Gale Island's ships had arrived!Soon, the warships were all docked.\"All those who will participate in the examination of Gale Island get on board now!\" cried a majestic middle-aged man on a warship in the middle. His voice was mixed with thick Genuine Qi and sounded like roaring thunder.People went on board one by one and Su Mo, following the crowd, also embarked on a warship.Soon, all of the people had completely boarded the warships, which hoisted their sails to set off again.Star-water Lake had many islands with a radius of 750 kilometers.Gale Island was located more than 200 kilometers away from Waterside City.The warships were sailing with the wind, and they would arrive at Gale Island at noon with a speed comparable to a galloping horse.Looking at the boundless water and surging waves, Su Mo was standing in the prow, thinking that there must be many exciting experiences in the sect.\"Hmm?\"At this time, Su Mo was suddenly awakened by a few gloomy eyes that he felt.After turning his head around, he found that Yan Qi and his fellows were coldly looking at him from the warship next to the one he was standing in.Su Mo smiled. \"If you act recklessly, I don't mind turning you into nourishment for my cultivation.\"Then Su Mo no longer cared about them.The warships rode the wind and waves, and more than four hours later, they finally got close to Gale Island.Standing in the prow, Gale Island appeared in Su Mo's field of view.It was a lush, green island.He could dimly see a large group of buildings standing in the center of the island and distributed in the mountains, which was spectacular.Before long, the warships arrived at the pier of Gale Island, where the ships docked and everyone disembarked.\"No one is allowed to wander around on the island. Anyone who violates this will be killed without exception!\"The middle-aged man came to the front of the people and coldly cried, \"Now, everyone follows me onto the island.\"Then, he turned around to go onto the island with 10,000 people following behind him....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this time, many people had been waiting there.Apparently, they were the examiners of Gale Island.\"Elder Wei, all examinees are here,\" said the middle-aged man respectfully to a small and stout elder.\"OK! You can step off!\"The small and stout elder waved his hand, then gave an instruction to a stony-faced youth.The youth nodded, strode out, and shouted while glancing at the crowd, \"Whoever has a recommendation from Purple Gold Pavilion, step out.\"Hua! Hua! Hua!About 100 people strode out from the crowd.Of course, Su Mo was one of them.They could directly become outer disciples due to the recommendations of Purple Gold Pavilion.Su Mo had heard that without recommendations or without being in the Spiritual Martial Realm, they could only be handyman disciples\u2014even if they had passed the test.Handyman disciples were the lowest disciples in Gale Island. And what was worse, they had to do daily chores, which was really torture.Thus, Su Mo wanted to be an outer disciple directly.Su Mo was not stupid and would not prove his force by passing all kinds of tests.It was nonsense.Since he had a recommendation, he would make full use of it.\"You follow me!\" the youth loudly yelled, looking at those 100 people.Then, he led them to the other side of the square.Seeing Su Mo and the other people go out, the remaining young men and girls were jealous.Immediately, based on the instructions given by the stout elder, they started to take the complex tests accordingly.After Su Mo and the others went to the other side, the youth collected their recommendations.Then, they lined up according to the youth's requirements.\"Your recommendations from Purple Gold Pavilion are a testament to your high talents. Thus, unlike the others, you can directly become our island's outer disciples without being tested,\" said the youth loudly in front of them.\"But, in order to know your talents well, please release your Martial Souls for me.\"When the youth finished, they let out their Martial Souls in unison without any hesitation.So did Su Mo.Boom! Boom! Boom!Instantly, many yellow lights were sprung out, giving off dazzling light.There were various Martial Souls, such as snakes, monkeys, tigers, knives, swords, axes, trees, flowers, grasses, and so on.Three of those Martial Souls were quite outstanding.They were respectively a golden revolving saber, a purple flower, and ice surrounded by its cold air.The three Martial Souls all had eight shining yellow rings. Obviously, they were in the Rank 8 Human Class.The golden revolving saber belonged to a tough young man while a dainty young girl in purple owned the purple flower.It was Yan Qi himself who had the ice Martial Soul.As for the others, most of them had Martial Souls of the Rank 7 Human Class. Only 20 people's were in the Rank 6 Human Class.And besides those, none of them had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul.Everyone except for Su Mo looked at Yan Qi and the other two people with envy in their eyes.In Gale Island, a person with a Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class would be considered a genius.One could say that it was much easier for a person with a Rank 8 Human Class Martial Soul to break through the Spiritual Martial Realm and enter into the True Spirit Realm, which was a higher realm.In the entire Skymoon Country, a True Spirit Realm martial artist was generally regarded to be the top one.Those three felt proud to draw people's attention, especially Yan Qi, who full of arrogance, disdainfully took a glimpse at Su Mo.Yan Qi had worried that Su Mo had higher talent than him upon seeing Su Mo's recommendation. But now, he scornfully laughed at Su Mo's Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul.The youth secretly nodded his head with his eyes brightened when he saw three Martial Souls of the Rank 8 Human Class.\"Good, three people's Martial Souls are in the Rank 8 Human Class. Very good. What are your names?\" said the youth with a smile. Apparently, he attached more importance to them.\"My name is Cao Yuan!\" said the tough youth.\"My name is Feng Zilan!\" said the young girl in purple.\"My name is Yan Qi!\"The stony-faced youth nodded, then glanced at the people and said, \"I know your Martial Souls and talents. Now, follow me to the outer area and you'll be given an abode.\"Then, they followed him, left the square, and walked towards the gate.On the square, nearly 10,000 young men and ladies were left behind to sit through rounds of tests. The atmosphere was very heated.The threshold test of Gale Island was divided into three parts.The first part was to test Martial Souls. The level of a Martial Soul was the most important benchmark to measure a martial artist's talent.The second part was to test comprehension, which was also significant for a martial artist to cultivate his talent. The higher comprehension that he had, the faster that he could practice martial arts.The last part was to test stamina. This part was to test a martial artist's willpower, stamina, and temperament. If a martial artist was not good in other aspects, a strong temperament and tough willpower would complement them.Overall, the tests of Gale Island were relatively comprehensive, covering the Martial Soul, comprehension, and temperament.Of course, the test of Martial Souls held the key, leaving the last two as a supplement.However, Su Mo did not need to attend those complex tests. Now, he had come to the outer area.Covering a vast region, the outer area was located on the mountainside with thousands of courtyards situated there. It was very spectacular.\"Well, this is the outer area. Courtyards from No.700 to No.1000 are available. You're at liberty to choose one of them to live in,\" said the youth indifferently after ushering them there.All the courtyards had visible house numbers, and besides, they were arranged in good order.\"Each courtyard has three separate rooms, so each courtyard can accommodate three people,\" he added.\"Excuse me, who lives there?\" a young man pointed to a place far away and asked just then.The crowd looked at that place and found that 10 lofts were located on the top of the outer area.Each of the 10 lofts had three floors. All of them were much more elegant and spectacular than regular courtyards.The stony-faced youth smiled at his question and said, \"That's where the 10 outer disciples live. In Gale Island, the more powerful you are, the better treatment you get. If one day you can defeat one of them, you'll replace him and live in the loft.\"The 10 outer disciples not only live in better places but also obtain much better resources than the regular outer disciples.\"Hence, you must redouble your efforts if you want better treatment,\" the young man patiently explained to them.Although the young man wore a stony face, he was warmhearted.The crowd was surprised by the huge difference between the 10 outer disciples and the regular outer disciples.\"Our sect will hold the Qingyuan Trial Test in 10 days and all new disciples are asked to attend the trial test. The outstanding disciples will obtain big rewards, so you must cultivate harder.\"Alright, you can choose your rooms. Each room has a sect brochure, which documents our sect rules and other things. You can have a look.\"After finishing his speech, the stony-faced young man was about to leave.\"By the way, I'm Wang Hui, the outer elder. If you find something incomprehensible, you can find me in the elder hall of the outer gate.\"After one more sentence, he left.\"Is he the outer elder?\"\"He looks 27 or 28 years old, but has he already become an elder?\"\"Huff! You don't understand. Although he appears to be 27 or 28 years old, he is likely in his 30s. Due to his higher cultivation, he looks much younger.\"They all burst into a discussion....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCourtyard No. 730. was where Su Mo chose to live, and now that no one else had chosen this place, he was alone.The courtyard had three rooms and Su Mo carelessly chose the one on the right.Entering the room, he found it to be very shabby with a small area of around 10 square meters. It was only equipped with one wooden bed, a desk, and a chair.As expected, a brochure was placed on the desk, which Su Mo read carefully.The first several pages of it gave a detailed description of Gale Island.As one of the four sects in Skymoon Country, Gale Island had a long history of 800 years.At present, nearly 20,000 people were on the island, including elders, deacons, and disciples.According to their cultivation, the disciples were classified into several levels, namely handyman disciples, outer disciples, inner disciples, as well as core disciples.Besides them, elders were also divided into outer elders and inner elders.Gale Island had also dozens of strict rules.The brochure also documented hundreds of common demonic beasts and Spiritual Herbs, which really widened his horizons.In the last pages, the brochure explained about the geographical landscape of Firmament and Continent.Firmament and Continent was divided into five continents, namely East Continent, South Continent, West Continent, North Continent, and Central Continent. Additionally, it had 108 domains.Skymoon Country was located in Hong Domain, East Continent and was one of the 100 countries.After he finished reading, Su Mo felt quite shocked and could not calm down.This world was much bigger than he thought. But as vast as Skymoon Country was, it was still small in Firmament and Continent. Thus, compared to the entire continent, it was like a drop in the bucket.Even if a martial artist was in the Spiritual Martial Realm, he could not step out of East Continent in his entire life, let alone martial artists in the Qi Cultivation Realm.Moreover, East Continent was just one of the five continents.\"Central Continent!\"Seeing Central Continent, Su Mo could not help thinking of Xi'er.\"How is she doing?\"\"Has she led a happy life since she went back?\"After a while, Su Mo closed the brochure and helplessly sighed. He sat cross-legged and was ready to cultivate.\"The clock is ticking and time flies!\"At this moment, noises resounded in the courtyard. Su Mo felt a little confused and strode out of the room.He found that two young men were talking to each other in the courtyard.One was good-looking in a brocade\u00a0robe while the other was wrapped in an animal hide. He was tall and sturdy and had dark skin.\"Tell you what, as long as you follow me, I'm sure you'll have a comfortable life here,\" said the young man in the brocade\u00a0robe to the dark-skinned young man.\"Brother Li Feng, all I want is to work hard in cultivating and become an expert. Then, after returning to my village, I can protect it and the villagers,\" replied the dark-skinned young man with a naive smile on his face.\"Haha! Under my protection, you'll become an expert much easier!\"The young man in the brocade\u00a0robe confidently patted himself on his chest.Hearing them talking, Su Mo speechlessly smiled. \"These two people should be the new handyman disciples. The young man in the brocade\u00a0robe was just recruited, but he wanted to rope in the dark-skinned youth.\"In Gale Island, the handyman disciples were also affiliated with the outer gate, thus, they lived together with the outer disciples. However, due to their lower cultivations, they had to do some daily chores.Even if some people were not in the Spiritual Martial Realm, the recommendations could help them directly become outer disciples, such as Su Mo.\"Brother, good day!\"Just then, the dark-skinned youth noticed Su Mo and respectfully paid homage to him hurriedly.Li Feng, who was in the brocade\u00a0robe, glimpsed Su Mo, squinted his eyes, and asked, \"Are you also a new disciple?\"\"Yeah!\" Su Mo nodded his head with a smile.\"You're an outer disciple directly because of a recommendation!\" Li Feng commented again, then confidently said with a smile, \"I'm a handyman disciple, but my talent is as high as yours.\"\"Is that so?\"Su Mo smiled and noncommittally shrugged.There were many geniuses among all the handyman disciples. After all, the Purple Gold Pavilion could not discover all of the geniuses of Skymoon Country and it only recommended a few geniuses.\"Humpf! You'll see. I'll become world-renowned in Skymoon Country in several years,\" said Li Feng coldly upon seeing Su Mo's expression, then strode into the central room.Su Mo still remained speechless and thought, \"This guy is overconfident! He brags that he'll be world-renowned just after he's been recruited.\"He was arrogant, however, he was unlike Yan Qi and other people, who felt proud of themselves but looked down on others.\"Brother, my name is Niu Xiaohu. We can look after each other,\" said the dark-skinned young man to Su Mo with a bow.\"I'm Su Mo.\" He nodded to him.\"Brother Su Mo, since you can be an outer disciple directly, you must be a genius.\"Niu Xiaohu innocently smiled, then scratched his head and said, \"I'm a little stupid. If Brother Su Mo is free in the future, I hope you can give me some instructions.\"Seeing his clean, simple, and sincere eyes, Su Mo could not help befriending him, thus, he chatted with him.Niu Xiaohu was born into a poor family in the north of Skymoon Country. His ancestors were hunters and so was he. He had a Martial Soul of the Rank 5 Human Class, which had been the highest one in his village for hundreds of years.Hence, he came here to attend the entrance examination. Both of his parents and the entire village laid great expectations on him.\"Xiaohu, as long as you're resolute and have a strong heart, you'll be a powerful man sooner or later.\"In the end, Su Mo patted him on his shoulder and encouraged him.\"Yeah!\" Niu Xiaohu profoundly nodded.Immediately, Su Mo went back to his room and cultivated cross-legged.The circling Spiritual Qi surrounded him. The Spiritual Qi in Gale Island was 10 times richer than they were in Sunnywood City. As a result, it was much easier for him to cultivate than it was before.Unfortunately, Su Mo was standing at the bottleneck of his cultivation, so he would not make a breakthrough within the next few days.Time flew by. The next morning, Su Mo heard someone knocking on his door.\"Brother Su Mo!\"Just then, Niu Xiaohu's voice resounded.\"Xiaohu, what's up?\" asked Su Mo after he opened the door.\"Brother, just now the deacon asked us to take our jade identification badges,\" said Niu Xiaohu.\"Oh, let's go now.\" Su Mo nodded and walked out with Niu Xiaohu.\"Yeah, almost forget Brother Li Feng!\"After Niu Xiaohu informed Li Feng, the three of them walked toward the Sect Affairs Hall of the outer gate.The mountainous road was crowded.Soon, they came to Sect Affairs Hall and lined up to receive the jade identification badges.The jade identification badges were green jade badges the size of a palm. They were very magical. If someone injected Genuine Qi into it, his identification information would appear on it.Su Mo gently injected a trace of Genuine Qi into it, then some characters instantly appeared on it.Name: Su Mo.Identity: Outer Disciple.Contribution points: zero.Based on the brochure, contribution points were the contributions a disciple made to the sect. Contribution points were precious, for they could be used to exchange for various kinds of resources.After receiving the jade badges, they went to the outer square.The outer square was very big. Many disciples were practicing martial arts techniques or fighting with each other, so\u00a0it was quite noisy.\"Many people are there. Brother Su Mo and Li Feng, let's go and have a look.\"Dozens of people were gathering at the edge of the square. They had also gone there out of curiosity.A two-meter-high, black stele was situated there, and it had many white crystals that were inscribed around it.Now, a young man in a yellow robe was attacking the stele. After a punch, it stayed motionless, but its crystals became luminous.\"What is it?\" Su Mo asked Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu.Niu Xiaohu shook his head, which indicated that he did not know.\"This is a stele for the ATK test, which is used to detect a martial artist's attack force.\"Apparently, Li Feng was knowledgeable. After a smile, he provokingly looked at Su Mo and said, \"Let's compare and figure out who has a stronger attack force.\"...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Stele for the ATK test?\"Su Mo curiously asked, \"How do we know the specific attack?\"\"It's very simple. Have you seen the crystals on the stele? These crystals represent the data. 250 kg of power, which is a tiger force, can light a crystal. How many tiger forces that you have, is how many crystals you'll light,\" Li Feng said.Su Mo shook his head and said, \"A crystal means a tiger force? That'll be a big error. If two people's attack power has little difference, the attack showing on the stele will be the same.\"\"Ignorant!\"Hearing that, Li Feng disdainfully laughed and said, \"Each crystal has five different colors, namely yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Yellow light means 50 kg of force. The rest of the colors mean 100 kg, 150 kg, 200 kg, and 250 kg, respectively. For example, if your strength is 4300 kg, then you can light nine crystals. The first eight crystals are all purple, and the ninth crystal is cyan.\"\"Oh, I got it!\"Su Mo nodded with a smile. The stele was very interesting, but he just did not know who designed it.\"How about we compare with each other? Do you dare to? If you don't, just forget what I said,\" Li Feng said with a proud look.\"Of course I do. But it'll be even more interesting if you add some gambling wager,\" Su Mo said with a smile. Judging from his manner, Li Feng was from a big and rich family.Now that he had decided to compare with him, Su Mo would gain some benefits from him.\"Gambling wager? Hehe, it seems that you're very confident!\" Li Feng laughed with bright eyes. \"Well, since you want to give me money, I, of course, will not refuse. How about we bet 20,000 taels of gold on it?\"Su Mo was surprised that Li Feng would like to bet 20,000 taels of gold, which meant that he was pretty rich.\"Okay, done.\"In fact, Su Mo was now poor for he had no Spiritual Stones, and only had just over 1,000 taels of gold remaining.However, to gamble he did not need to have money because he was sure of his victory.That was because Li Feng was not a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm but a martial artist of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and few martial artists in that realm could beat him in attack\u00a0power.\"Well, I'll go first. Keep your eyes open wide!\"With a confident look, Li Feng walked through the crowd to the front of the stele.\"Ho!\"After a loud shout, Li Feng's breath exploded out and his momentum skyrocketed.\"Powerful momentum! He is at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"\"Awesome! A few people are at the Lv 9 among these new disciples.\"The crowd all burst into a discussion.Most of these disciples around the stele were new and all curious about the stele, so they surrounded to watch.Among the 500 newly recruited disciples, many of them were at Lv 7 or Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, a few disciples were at Lv 9, and a couple of disciples were in the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm?\"Su Mo nodded without surprise. Niu Xiaoxu had told him that Li Feng's Martial Soul was at Rank 7 Human Class, so it was not surprising that Le Feng could have the cultivation of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Gold Stone Fist!\"At this point, Li Feng shouted and heavily punched the stele for the ATK test.Boom!A wave of ripples appeared on its surface with a boom, and immediately, the crystals on it were lit up.One Crystal!Three Crystals!Five!Eight!Nine!After the nine crystals shined with a purple light, the 10th crystal twinkled and then shined with a blue light.2450 kg!\"Brother Li Feng, cool!\" Niu Xiaohu said with his face full of adoration.The crowd was in an uproar again. A normal martial artist at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm had nine tigers' strength, but Li Feng actually had 2,450 kilograms of power, which had approached 10 tigers' strength, and it proved that he was stronger than a martial artist at the peak of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Li Feng looked at Su Mo with a proud face, saying, \"Su Mo, do you still want to try? How about directly giving me the money?\"In Li Feng's view, no one could be stronger than him, except for the disciples in the Spiritual Martial Realm and the disciples a half step from the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Your strength is only 2450 kilograms with the cultivation of Lv 9. Shame on you!\"Su Mo shook his head, went straight to the stele, and used his Genuine Qi to punch the stele.Su Mo controlled the force of his punch to be just stronger than that a martial artist at the peak of the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Upon hearing Su Mo's words, Li Feng was in a daze for a moment before he showed a dismissive expression. He did not believe that Su Mo could attack better than him.The crystals on the stele were lit up after Su Mo punched it.One Crystal!Three Crystals!Five!Eight!10!The first 10 crystals were all blooming purple light, however, instead of stopping there, the 11th crystal turned yellow, but then the light quickly transformed into a blue light.10 crystals were in purple and the 11th crystal was blue.2700 kg!That was more than 10 tigers' strength and had gotten close to 11 tigers' strength.People were shocked and looked at Su Mo with reverence.Niu Xiaohu was stunned!Apparently, Su Mo's strength was beyond his expectations.Li Feng was also shocked and in disbelief. 2700 kg with a punch meant that he was stronger than those at the peak of Lv 9 and was almost equal to those at a half step from the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Li Feng, give me 20,000 taels of gold!\" Su Mo said with a smile, stretching out his hand.\"Ah...\"Li Feng was speechless and asked with a gloomy face, \"Su Mo, how could you have such a strong attack? It doesn't make sense!\"They were in the same realm, but Su Mo was a tiger strength stronger than him. Li Feng usually saw himself as a genius, so he could not accept the result.Actually, Su Mo was at the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, but Li Feng thought that Su Mo was at the Lv 9, and if he knew the truth, that would be even more unacceptable to him.\"Li Feng, you are a genius, and then you should know that a genius can't be measured by common sense!\"Su Mo teased him.Er!Li Feng was speechless and his face turned red for the \"genius\" that Su Mo said sounded harsh to him.\"Humph! I lost!\"Li Feng did not go back on his word. He took out 20,000 gold tickets and gave them to Su Mo.Su Mo was overjoyed because he could buy some Beast Souls in the sect for his Martial Soul with the 20,000 taels of gold.\"Get out of my way!\"At this time, a loud cry came from behind the crowd and the vigor of the Spiritual Martial Realm blew the people away.Only Su Mo and Li Feng stood still.Su Mo turned his head and saw that it was a boy in black with a hooked nose and an evil face.\"Wu Kui? What do you mean?\"Li Feng coldly said. Apparently, he knew this person.\"Yo, I thought about who he was! It turns out to be you, a waste.\"When the teenager saw Li Feng, his face was full of mockery.\"Wu Kui, you're going too far,\" Li Feng angrily said.Wu Kui sneered, \"A defeated man dares to shout at me! Get out of here, or I'll show you no mercy!\"\"You...\"Li Feng grit his teeth with a livid face, but finally he stepped aside.Wu Kui was an extremely dangerous man. Li Feng did not dare to offend him now.\"Hmm?\"Seeing a person still standing in front of him, Wu Kui coldly said two words with his face going black and rage: \"F*ck off!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough the word did not reveal any emotions, Wu Kui made it sound arrogant and condescending.Su Mo squinted his eyes and thought that Wu Kui was even more arrogant than Yan Qi.\"What if I don't make room for you?\" Su Mo indifferently replied.The test tablet was originally placed here for the disciples on the island. If Wu Kui wanted to take the test, Su Mo would definitely make room for him.But Wu Kui's arrogance of telling him to fu*k off arose Su Mo's killing desire.\"You won't?\"Wu Kui felt a little bit surprised. He looked at Su Mo coldly and said with a frightening smile, \"You're brave and fearless! But I wonder who can back you up. Do you know the consequences of your insults? Or do you think Li Feng will help you?\"Wu Kui had seen Su Mo talking with Li Feng, so he thought that they were close.\"I don't need anyone's help. I've seen so many idiots like you, and I'm tired of hearing these kinds of threats!\" Su Mo disdainfully said, shaking his head.\"What?\"Hearing this, Wu Kui's eyes were like vipers, full of killing desire.\"Since you're asking to die, I'll satisfy your wish.\"With Genuine Qi surging in his hands and his clothes billowing without any wind, Wu Kui was preparing to kill Su Mo.\"Wu Kui, stop it!\" Li Feng coldly yelled.Wu Kui looked at Li Feng and said with a scornful smile, \"Do you actually want to help him? He's just a loser, but if you're also asking to die, then make your move!\"\"I'm not offering to help him!\"Li Feng shook his head and continued, \"Wu Kui, Gale Island forbids its disciples from fighting each other in private. If someone breaks the rule, he'll be confined for one month or expelled from the sect. Do you still want to break this rule?\"At that, Wu Kui furrowed his brows and pondered deeply.Li Feng was not lying. Wu Kui had just entered the sect and did not have a strong footing, so he decided that it was not worth it to be expelled over an insignificant person.\"Boy, I'm letting you off easy for once. When the Qingyuan Trial Test comes around, I'll have you begging me for mercy,\" said Wu Kui coldly. He circled around Su Mo, walked in front of the test tablet, and swung his right hand into the tablet.Boom!The tablet shuddered, and the test crystals on it shone brightly.One Crystal!10 crystals!15 crystals!All 15 of the test crystals shone with a dazzling purple light.The strength of 15 tigers!Everyone was shocked.No wonder he was an expert of the Spiritual Martial Realm. His casual strike was the strength of 15 tigers, or 375 kilograms of force.Wu Kui shot a proud glance at Su Mo.Su Mo narrowed his eyes. \"The strength of 15 tigers? He isn't too weak.\"However, that alone was not enough to terrify him.\"Li Feng, Xiaohu, let's go!\" Su Mo shouted and turned around to leave.Niu Xiaohu hurried behind him, and Li Feng left with a groan.\"Li Feng, do you know Wu Kui well?\" Su Mo asked Li Feng on the mountain.\"I come from the same city as him,\" said Li Feng with a nod. Then, he reminded him, \"Su Mo, I'm begging you not to antagonize Wu Kui. He's a very scary man.\"\"Oh? How is he scary? Explain it to me,\" said Su Mo.Li Feng sighed and said, \"Wu Kui has a Rank 8 Human Class Martial Soul, and he is incredibly talented. His cultivation is already at the peak Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, and he is very brutal and cruel. Anyone who offends him will die a terrible death.\"Li Feng used to have some conflict with Wu Kui. Although he was not close with Su Mo, he also did not want to see Wu Kui kill Su Mo.He had spoken out before to help Su Mo diffuse the situation.Although he had lost 20,000 taels of gold to Su Mo, he had accepted his loss without complaint.That amount of gold was nothing to him.\"Thank you for your reminder. However, I am not provoking him, but he is provoking me.\"Su Mo nodded and thanked Li Feng. Li Feng was a proud man, but he was essentially kind.Then, Su Mo's tone changed, and he said coldly, \"If he doesn't know what's good for him, he will undoubtedly pay for it.\"Er!Li Feng choked in shock and stared at Su Mo.He thought himself to be very proud already, and he never expected that this seemingly gentle young man was even prouder than him.Li Feng shook his head. \"How can a martial artist in the Qi Cultivation Realm look down upon a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm? Where does his confidence come from?\"\"Do you know how the Qingyuan Trial Test works?\" asked Su Mo. He knew that Li Feng came from a great family and had seen it all, so he wanted to learn a little about the test beforehand.\"The Qingyuan Trial Test is conducted on Qingyuan Island, and it's mostly hunting demonic beasts,\" said Li Feng. He knew about the Qingyuan Trial Test, but he did not know much about the specific rules.\"Hunting demonic beasts?\"Su Mo's eyes flashed. \"That's so simple. Isn't this a perfect opportunity to increase my abilities and my Martial Soul level?\"\"Hehe, I like hunting demonic beasts,\" said Niu Xiaohu with a smile. \"Since I was 10, I've hunted demonic beasts with my village. Killing demonic beasts is my strongest talent.\"\"Hehe, Xiaohu, I hope you do well in the test,\" said Su Mo with a smile.Niu Xiaohu only had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul, but he was very diligent at cultivating and had already reached early-stage of the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm. His abilities were average among the new disciples.The three men returned to the courtyard and went to their separate rooms.In his room, Su Mo was deep in thought. He left the room and walked to the Contribution Palace.Su Mo wanted to exchange contribution points.Gale Island's sect manual detailed the many different ways to earn contribution points.Disciples of the sect could earn sect contribution points by giving the sect Spiritual Herbs, cultivation methods, martial arts techniques, and demonic beast materials, or by completing tasks for the sect.Of course, they could also simply contribute money to the sect.After all, monetary wealth led to more resources.Su Mo had just won 20,000 taels of gold from Li Feng, so he wanted to exchange it for contribution points to buy Beast Souls.In Sunnywood City, Su Mo's Martial Soul level was probably the highest among everyone.Now, on Gale Island, a Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul was too low. There were so many people who had a higher level than him.Su Mo exchanged all of his gold at the Contribution Hall, and only received 20 contribution points.One contribution point cost 2,000 taels of gold.Afterwards, Su Mo used the 20 contribution points to purchase 10 Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Soul Crystals.A Class 1 Lv 2 demonic beast was equivalent to a martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm. One Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Soul Crystal cost two contribution points, which was 2,000 taels of gold.The price was five times that of a Class 9 Lv 1 demonic beast Soul Crystal.Su Mo sat cross-legged in his room and released his Devouring Martial Spirit.Crack!He crushed a Soul Crystal that had a Beast Soul of Lizard inside. As soon as the crystal burst, the Beast Soul charged out with a roar and opened its mouth towards Su Mo.Su Mo was terrified. He did not expect that this Lv 2 Beast Souls would still have a conscience.He hastily spurred his Martial Soul, and a strong suction force instantly devoured the Beast Soul of Lizard.This demonic beast was probably very powerful when it was alive, but it was now only a soul and could not resist Su Mo's Devouring Martial Spirit.After his Devouring Martial Spirit devoured this Beast Soul, Su Mo did not feel any changes and continued devouring.Soon, he had gone through all 10 Beast Souls.His Devouring Martial Spirit still did not progress.Su Mo was extremely disappointed. His Martial Soul had stopped at the Rank 6 Human Class for a very long time, and he had already devoured a large number of Beast Souls in Sunnywood City. Now, even though he had just devoured another 10 Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Souls, he still had not progressed.\"What's wrong? Can my Martial Soul only progress to the Rank 6 Human Class?\"Su Mo was confused. Although each higher level required more Beast Souls to achieve, he did not think that any level required such a large amount.\"Oh well! If I keep devouring, I'm sure I'll progress eventually!\"Su Mo still could not understand after a while, so he could only sigh and stop thinking about it.Then, he cleared his mind of distractions and began to cultivate.However, Su Mo did not cultivate Genuine Qi, and instead, he began cultivating his body.This was because his cultivating speed was slowing down as his cultivation increased. It would be very difficult to break through the bottleneck and increase his cultivation to Lv 9 before the Qingyuan Trial Test.Thus, he decided to cultivate his physical strength, so that he could complete Lv 3 Elephant's Strength Skill before the Qingyuan Trial Test. Then, his physical force would exceed that of a martial artist at the peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, and it would rival even a martial artist that was a half step from the Spiritual Martial Realm.This way, his combined abilities would not be inferior to any of the new disciples.In his room, surging Spiritual Qi collected around Su Mo, and countless runes flew into his body.He cultivated to no end, and in the blink of an eye, days had flown by.The Qingyuan Trial Test was about to begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu stepped out.\"Senior Brother Su Mo, morning.\" Greeted Niu Xiaohu with a smile.\"Xiaohu, you've progressed a lot in cultivation recently.\"Said Su Mo with a smile. He could sense that the Qi in Niu Xiaohu had been enhanced a lot so that he was at the middle stage of the Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Ha ha! Due to the rich Spiritual Qi in Gale Island, I can cultivate much faster than when I was at home,\" replied Niu Xiaohu with a naive smile.\"Su Mo, Qingyuan Trial Test will begin today. Let's contend with each other to see who can get a higher ranking.\"Li Feng looked at Su Mo, his eyes surged with fighting desire.Since Su Mo defeated him in terms of the attack last time, Li Feng had worked harder these days and wanted to defeat Su Mo.As a result, he had made a huge progression in cultivation.Though he was at the middle stage of the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, his cultivation was much stronger than that of the peak stage.Besides the attack, the overall strength of a martial artist was also decided by speed, defense, and fighting experience.Thus, in his view, he was as powerful as Su Mo, and he was very confident in this trial test.\"Deal! How about 20,000 taels of gold?\"Su Mo wore a thought-provoking smile on the corner of his lips.\"Deal!\"\"Yeah! Let's go!\"The three walked together towards the outer square where the Sect had summoned all new disciples.Now, more than 300 people were waiting there. Each one was excited and wanted to cause a stir in this trial test.\"On average, this year's new disciples are all powerful,\" said Su Mo, after looking around.More than 40 of the 300 people were at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Even the lowest ones were at the Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.This year, Gale Island laid on higher threshold requirements. As a result, only a few disciples would be recruited, but each was an elite.The four sects in Skymoon Country almost had the same rule that if the new disciple could not reach the Spiritual Martial Realm within two years, he would be expelled.The four sects were very powerful, so they would definitely reject wastes.Each year, Gale Island would expel many people.Hence, Gale Island laid on higher threshold requirements this year.Su Tianhao and Su Hai of the Sus had joined the Sky Yuan Sect for one year, so if they remained at the Qi Cultivation Realm and could not reach the Spiritual Martial Realm within one year, they would also be expelled by the Sky Yuan Sect.\"These people aren't threats, and our biggest opponents are those at the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Hearing this, Li Feng shook his head and seriously said, \"Eight of these new disciples are at the Spiritual Martial Realm, who are powerful rivals, especially the five super geniuses with Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class.\"\"Are there five people with Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class?\"Su Mo was surprised. He had known that four people had Martial Souls of the Rank 8 Human Class, including Yan Qi, Yan Lan, Yan Xing and Wu Kui. However, there was another one.\"Yeah! Five people's Martial Souls are at Rank 8 Human Class, and they're called 'the new five geniuses'. Each one is highly talented, and a rumor is that the Sect will spare no efforts to cultivate them,\" said Li Feng.\"The five geniuses?\"Su Mo smiled. Since he was cultivating in seclusion these days, it was the first time that he heard of it.\"Look, here comes Yan Qi, one of the five geniuses.\"\"An expert at the Spiritual Martial Realm has such a strong momentum!\"Suddenly, uproars flowed through the crowd.Su Mo turned around and found that two young men and a lady were slowly walking forward. The handsome young man in yellow emitted a strong and unscrupulous Qi.He was Yan Qi.As for the two people next to him, they were Yan Xing and a maid in blue, Yan Lan.As they walked to the square, the crowd gave way to them.Full of arrogance, Yan Qi looked around. When seeing Su Mo, he got a cold smile on the corner of his lips.Su Mo clearly saw his expression, but he did not treat a martial artist at the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm as a threat at all.Cao Yuan, Feng Zilan, and Wu Kui arrived soon after Yan Qi.As sturdy as Niu Xiaohu, Cao Yuan was taller than Niu Xiaohu. Wearing a stony face, he carried a long black saber on his back, making him mighty and domineering.Unlike Cao Yuan, Feng Zilan was much weaker. She was not that beautiful but had a nice body, which was very attractive to men.When the four geniuses arrived, the crowd suddenly quieted. The four seemed to be telepathic and stared at each other while fighting desire surged in their eyes.Wu Kui was wearing a black robe and his eyes were ghastly cold. He pulled out his red tongue to lick his lips. A sneer appeared in the corner of his lips.Full of confidence, he would be the No.1 of this trial test. Whoever wanted to stand in his way would be killed, including the other four geniuses.After all new disciples reached the square, the crowd's attention was drawn to a man walking towards them from afar.This young man in a white robe was good-looking with a smile on his face.He seemed to walk slowly. Actually, he walked very quickly and just in a blink, he stood in front of the crowd.He carried a huge white bow on his back. Although he appeared to be common without any Qi in his body, everyone could sense an invisible pressure from him.Su Mo could not help but squint his eyes upon looking at the young man. He could feel that he was much more powerful than Wu Kui.\"He is Luo Qianfan, one of the five geniuses.\" Li Feng explained to Su Mo.\"Luo Qianfan?\" murmured Su Mo.He remembered the name by heart.He knew that the young man would be his biggest rival.Su Mo felt somewhat excited about this Qingyuan Trial Test, where there must be fierce competitions.\"He keeps a low profile and rarely appears in public. It's said that he has some relationship with the island, which remains a mystery to verify,\" said Li Feng.\"Senior Brother Li Feng and Su Mo, why do I feel that he's common?\" asked Niu Xiaohu puzzledly while scratching his head.\"Ho ho!\"Su Mo smiled at his words and said, \"Xiaohu, you should see through a person. Though he doesn't reveal his Qi, his eyes are profound and energy is extremely deep. Feel through and you'll find him different.\"\"Is that so? I'll have a try.\"Niu Xiaohu nodded his head.When they were chatting, dozen of strong imposing manners suddenly got closer from afar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were a dozen men moving towards them, like flying shadows, from the distant mountaintop. At the same time, the majestic atmosphere that came with them was spreading all around.Su Mo was so shocked that his eyes were wide open. \"They can fly.\" He thought.Rumor had it that it was no problem for a man to fly in the air when he broke through the Spiritual Martial Realm and reached the True Spirit Realm. Now he knew that it was true.Boom!After arriving at the square, the flying figures stood floating in front of the crowd as well as in the air. A strong atmosphere circled around each of them.The whole square went quiet all of the sudden.Everyone present felt a depressing tension. Their looks were instantly changed, and they struggled to breathe.The head of the flying team was a stout elder, Elder Wei, the same person who had hosted the entrance examination the other day.Elder Wei was said to be the third elder of the outer gate, a powerful man.Elder Wei stood steadily in the air. His gaze swept over the new disciples, finally settling on Wu Kui, Yan Qi, Feng Zilan and the other two. \"You five are very good, and you all own Martial Souls of Rank 8 Human Class. You're the most talented among your peers. I look forward to your performances during the coming trial test.\"The rest of the elders were also looking at the five young men, smiling. Their eyes were filled with appreciation.There were more than 10,000 disciples on Gale Island. Less than 100 of them possessed Martial Souls of Rank 8 Human Class. It was rare for people to hold Martial Souls of Rank 8 Human Class.Yan Qi and the other four were totally qualified to get special training offered by Gale Island.\"As someone who presides over the Qingyuan Trial Test for the New Disciples, today, I shall fill you in with the trial test rules.\"Elder Wei spoke again in a voice that could shake the whole square.All those present suddenly cheered up and listened to him carefully.\"The Qingyuan Trial Test will last for three days and be held on Qingyuan Island. Your simple task is to hunt demonic beasts and achieve Demonic Cores as many as you can.\"In spite of its small size of 50 thousand square kilometers, there are tens of thousands of demonic beasts living on Qingyuan Island. The trial test is graded by the number of Demonic Cores that you obtain. The more Demonic Cores you gain, the higher score you get. A Demonic Core of a Class 7 Lv 1 demonic beast is the lowest as one point. A Class 9 Lv 1 Demonic Core is four points while a Class 1 Lv 2 Demonic Core is eight points, and so on.\"The trial test has four rules. Please pay attention to the following. First, only the Demonic Cores obtained on Qingyuan Island can be counted as your score. Your own Demonic Cores aren't available in the trial test. Don't even think about cheating. We have our ways to tell the difference.\"Second, the top 20 of the trial test will be rewarded.\"Third, during the trial test, there will be many elders monitoring the island to control the entire trial. If you run into danger on the island, just shout, 'I give up' loudly, and you'll be taken out within ten minutes. As a result, you lose the access to the competition.\"Fourth, you have to go through suffering to become a powerful man, so during the trial test, you could rob and slaughter at your will.\"Elder Wei sounded like thunder, especially the last four words. They had the sound of murder.His words startled everyone. Their eyes were flashing, and their expressions seemed worried.\"Slaughter at your will! It's highly likely that this trial test will turn into a riot of fighting and killing!\"Su Mo secretly nodded and knew that Elder Wei's words were right. The method was cruel, yet it made sense.Flowers in the greenhouse might become experts, but they could never be the powerful ones.One could never overrun the whole world and go anywhere as he pleased, going anywhere as he pleased if he had not gone through hell first.Just then, Su Mo felt two murderous stares fall on him.Arching his eyebrows, he turned and found that the stares were coming from Yan Qi and Wu Kui.Their murderous eyes were tightly fixed on Su Mo.Su Mo sneered and decided to ignore them.Elder Wei once again glanced at the disciples and said, \"Now, let me announce the reward of the trial test. The first prize is 300 contribution points; the second place will be rewarded with 200 contribution points; the third winner gains 100 contribution points. From the fourth place to the 10th place, each gets the prize of 50 contribution points. Whoever ranks from the 11th to the 20th place will receive 30 contribution points.\"Elder Wei's speech quieted the entire crowd.All the new disciples widened their eyes and breathed quickly with burning faces.The island was rich in resources. The disciples of Gale Island could exchange their contribution points for any treasure as long as they had enough.Therefore, on Gale Island, the contribution points played an important role when it came to rewards.The achievement of contribution points was extremely difficult for ordinary disciples. Even if they could exchange gold for it, one contribution point was worth of 63kg of gold.Now, rewards of the Qingyuan Trial Test were amazing. Even the 20th contender could obtain 30 contribution points. And the champion was entitled to 300 contribution points.300 contribution points, in fact, were worth almost 19,000kg of gold.Many of the new disciples came from the great wealthy clans, and they had outstanding family backgrounds. But now, even as sophisticated as they were, they could not be more surprised.Gale Island was good at taking full advantage of its wealth.They were paying so many contributions on one merely new disciple trial test.Su Mo was amazed as well. After recovering from his astonishment, he could not help being excited. Fanaticism shone in his eyes.If he possessed 300 contribution points, Su Mo could buy a large number of elixir to strengthen his cultivation and many Beast Souls to upgrade his Martial Soul's level.His cultivation would soar rapidly and reach the top level within a short time.The scene's atmosphere changed right away, and the killing intent that had been hidden in people's eyes was deliberately exposed. They all seemed cautious when they looked at the people next to them.Some so-called friends started being on the alert against each other even though they had nice relationships before.\"Am I understood?\" Elder Wei shouted.He glanced sharply at all the disciples.\"Yes, Sir!\" The crowd shouted back.\"Well, good. Go to the dock to board, now!\"Elder Wei led the other elders, flying directly to Qingyuan Island. They were like speeding light that almost cut the sky into two halves.The warships of Gale Island had been waiting a long time by the shore. When all 500 new disciples finished boarding, they drove to the Island.Qingyuan Island was located in the southern waters 300km of Gale Island.High mountains and dense forests formed Gale Island, and it was covered with numerous demonic beasts, fairy flowers, and magical herbs, making it a perfect trial test place for the new disciples.Therefore, in recent years, the new disciples of Gale Island had been doing their trial tests here.The new disciples were not only able to practice and enhance themselves during the trial but also had access to other resources on the island, such as the sky talent and land treasures.The warships sailed so fast that they arrived at Gale Island by noon.After landing on the island, all the people gathered just outside the wooded mountain.All the elders, including Elder Wei, had waited here for a long time.\"All people shall enter the forest in batches. Disciples with low cultivation go first.\"Elder Wei said loudly, \"disciples at the Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, get going!\"Over 300 disciples rushed out of the crowd and hurried into the forest like thunder.As soon as the 300 people entered the forest, they all disappeared in the blink of an eye, just like mud cattle sinking into the sea.Su Mo secretly nodded to himself and knew that this arrangement had been made for the sake of the low cultivation disciples.After all, a trial test like this did not do much favor for the disciples with low cultivation.If they all entered together, some of the higher cultivation disciples were likely to hide in the deep woods and try to kill those with low cultivation.\"Whoever at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm may now enter the mountain forest,\" Elder Wei said again about 15 minutes later.Su Mo and Niu Xiaohu looked at each other. They stepped out and rushed into the mountain forest, along with more than 100 disciples of the same level of cultivation.Wu Kui stood outside the wood and stared coldly at Su Mo's back, an evil smile creeping onto his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They ran like the wind together in the mountain forest.\"Xiaohu, are you with me or on your own?\" asked Su Mo.After some thoughts, Niu Xiaohu said, \"Senior Brother Su Mo, I'll go alone!\"Niu Xiaohu wanted to go alone not because he did not trust Su Mo.Although he was simple and honest, he was not foolish. If they were together, who would be responsible for killing and who would gain the Demonic Cores? It was a problem.So he chose to go alone.\"OK, be careful!\"Su Mo nodded. He did not stop him.\"Yeah, Senior Brother Su Mo, be careful, too. I have to go.\"Niu Xiaohu nodded and ran quickly in another direction.Watching Niu Xiaohu leave, Su Mo took a deep breath and went into the deep mountain forest.Demonic beasts were all over the forest. It was also a heavenly and treasured place for increasing cultivation for Su Mo.It had been a long time since he had killed demonic beasts and swallowed blood essence on Breezewind Mountain.He would swallow blood essence with abandon this time.Boom!After killing a Class 6 Lv 1 Cyan-eyed Tiger, Su Mo looked around. He released his Martial Soul to fully swallow its Beast Soul and blood essence instantly.Although the level of a Class 6 Lv 1 demonic beast was too low, and the Beast Soul and the blood essence were of little benefit to Su Mo, something was better than nothing.He would certainly not give up the prey in front.He took out the Demonic Core, leaving behind the withered dead body.Although a Class 6 Lv 1 Demonic Core was useless in this trial test, it was still valuable.Several hundred meters away, Su Mo heard a roar. At the same time, six Cyan-eyed Tigers ran quickly toward him.\"Haha!\"Su Mo was not frightened to see so many demonic beasts on Qingyuan Island. He was happy.So many demonic beasts had appeared in such a short time.Boom! Boom! Boom!Su Mo waved his fists to smash the six tigers instantly, causing a rain of blood.Su Mo let his Martial Soul out again and devoured the Beast Souls and the blood essence.However, a forced smile soon appeared on his face.He had devoured the six Beast Souls, but only 20% of the blood essence.The six Cyan-eyed Tigers had burst into residue and their blood was immersed into the ground, thus, 80% of the blood was wasted.\"I shouldn't kill demonic beasts so crazily!\"Depressed, he shook his head and advanced again.There were indeed many demonic beasts on Qingyuan Island. The density of demonic beasts in the mountain forest was much higher than that on Breezewind Mountain.Almost two hours later, Su Mo was deep in the mountain forest, where he met demonic beasts with higher levels.Hiss!Hearing a hiss, he saw a giant yellow python. It was tens of meters long and as thick as a bucket. It rushed from the grass and opened its bloody mouth, ready to bite his head.Su Mo could smell its stench.The strength of the python was equivalent to the Peak of Class 8 Lv 1.\"You're courting death!\"Su Mo howled. He glided over the python's attack and rode it until he hit its head.Bang!The python's rock-like skull was crushed. Fresh blood and white brains splashed out.\"What?\"Devouring the python's blood essence and Beast Soul, he heard beasts roaring and the sound of fighting from a faraway place.Judging from the sound, Su Mo could tell that there were at least ten demonic beasts.With Su Mo's present strength, he could make his genuine Qi flow to his ears, then feel any disturbance or trouble within 500 meters.\"Maybe it's a group of beasts. Go and see!\" Su Mo thought to himself.He took the Demonic Core of the python out and ran in the direction of the noise.He did not want to miss so many demonic beasts. His cultivation had been at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm. Besides, he had swallowed a great deal of beast blood essence.He could feel that he was ready to break through his realm.Su Mo soon came to a valley.It was the place where the roars and sounds of fierce fighting had just come from.Jumping up into a big tree in the mouth of the valley, he looked carefully into the valley.He saw 30 to 40 giant black wolves gathering. This kind of wolf was called the Ironteeth Wolf. They were demonic beasts at the Peak of Class 8 Lv 1.In the wolf pack, he saw an Ironteeth Wolf king. Its physique was bigger than the others. The Ironteeth Wolf king was clearly a Class 9 Lv 1 demonic beast.At the moment, the wolf pack was sieging upon two young men.The two young men were new disciples of Gale Island. They were both thin and extremely similar, thus, it was clear that they were brothers.Their cultivations had reached the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Although they had great strength, they could not fight against the entire pack. They had killed more than ten wolves, but they were also wounded.Besides, the Ironteeth Wolf king gave sneak attacks from time to time, thus, the two young disciples were not in an optimistic situation.\"Hey buddy, since you're here, why not give us a hand?\"One of the youths saw Su Mo hiding in the tree and shouted to him.\"Have I been discovered?\"Su Mo was surprised because the tree was more than 200 meters away from the young men and he was careful enough to hold his breath, never thinking that the youths would discover himSince he had been discovered, Su Mo did not hide. He jumped down and walked towards them.\"Brother, there are three strains of Jadeglow Grass in the mountain forest. We'll hold the wolf pack. Go get the Jadeglow Grass quickly!\" shouted the other yellow-clothed disciple after seeing Su Mo.\"Jadeglow Grass?\"He knew that Jadeglow Grass was a kind of Upper Lv 1 Spiritual Herb. If a martial artist with higher Qi Cultivation Realm swallowed it, they could save two months in cultivation practice.A martial artist with cultivation in a bottleneck could easily break through a cultivation realm after swallowing Jadeglow Grass. Su Mo was just such a martial artist.\"OK, be careful!\"Without any hesitation, Su Mo bypassed the wolf pack and rushed deep into the valley.Awoo!Seeing Su Mo rush into the valley, the wolf king howled, ordering the wolf pack to pursue Su Mo.\"You're not going anywhere!\"The two youths shouted and let their Martial Souls out to use the strongest fighting capacity, firmly stalling the wolf pack, and buying some time for Su Mo.Su Mo rushed into the valley and found the three strains of Jadeglow Grass under a rock wall fairly quickly.The three strains of Jadeglow Grass were 23 to 26cm high, surrounded by mist and full of Spiritual Qi.After taking the three strains of Jadeglow Grass, Su Mo cast his skills to fly out of the valley.\"Done. Let's go!\"Reaching the mouth of the valley, Su Mo shouted and rushed out.In fact, with Su Mo's current strength, he could kill and swallow all the Ironteeth Wolves. However, considering the two young disciples, he did not do that.Seeing that Su Mo had gotten the Jadeglow Grass, the two youths made efforts to repel the wolf pack and ran after Su Mo quickly.Awoo! Awoo! Awoo!The wolf pack was quite angry and quickly chased the three people.However, after chasing them over five kilometers, the wolf pack stopped.Demonic beasts had their own domains. Once the wolf pack entered other areas, they would fight with other demonic beasts. Thus, they finally retreated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A moment later, they came to a concealed meadow.\"Hey, you two. There are three strains of Jadeglow Grass, so each of us can get one,\" Su Mo said, looking at the two youths with a smile.It was the first time he was able to look at the two youths clearly. Their skinny faces and long, narrow eyes gave off an air of gloom.\"Ho ho, thank you, Junior Brother. Thanks for picking the Jadeglow Grass for us.\"The two looked at each other. The one in yellow gave a strange smile.\"Huh?\"Su Mo raised his eyebrows, then squinted. \"Picking the Jadeglow Grass for you? What do you mean?\"They laughed coldly and blocked Su Mo in front and behind.\"You! Such a small fry only at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm! How dare you want to share the Jadeglow Grass with us! Leave the Jadeglow Grass and get out!\" the youth in black shouted coldly, sneering.\"You couldn't have gotten the Jadeglow Grass blades without me. Now, you dare to monopolize them?\"Su Mo darkened his face.He did not expect that the two were so greedy that they could suddenly turn hostile over Jadeglow Grass.Shaking his head, the one in black said in a low voice, \"Because of your help, we could spare your life. Now leave the Jadeglow Grass immediately and get out!\"\"Ho, interesting! Due to my help, you spare my life? How generous you are!\"Su Mo scoffed, with cold light flashing in his eyes.Noticing that Su Mo did not appreciate their kindness, the other youth said, \"Brother, save your words! Just kill him.\"\"Hey, boy! This is your last chance! Give us the Jadeglow Grass or die!\"His face suddenly turned ferocious.Su Mo shook his head with killing desire in his eyes and said, \"You're rendering me a chance? What a shame! There is no chance for you two!\"The two looked at Su Mo in amazement and asked, \"What do you mean, boy?\"\"I mean, both of you'll die,\" Su Mo said indifferently.\"We'll die? Are you insane?\"The youth in black sneered and shouted, \"Brother, kill him!\"\"Go to hell!\"The youth in yellow laughed cruelly and attacked Su Mo with a palm.\"You're courting death!\"With a stony face, Su Mo did not panic at all. He punched against the palm. The force of ninefold fist spurted out immediately.He gave full force to this fist.As the first martial arts technique Su Mo had cultivated, Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist was only a Medium Lv 1 fistplay, but powerful enough.Due to its moderate level, it was not difficult. Although Su Mo had not cultivated too much in the past month, he had achieved the Completion Realm.Boom!When Su Mo's fist hit his palm, the youth's whole body shook. Bleeding everywhere, he screamed and was blown away. He had already died when he fell onto the ground.His arms were broken to pieces by Su Mo's insane and violent force.His internal organs were shattered to meat puree.\"Brother?\"The youth in black was shocked. He stared at Su Mo in disbelief. Alarmed, he asked, \"Are... aren't you at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm? Are you in the Spiritual Martial Realm?\"In his opinion, only a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm could kill his brother with one fist.After killing the youth in yellow with one fist, Su Mo turned to the youth in black.\"I don't want the Jadeglow Grass anymore. I'm leaving, now,\" said the youth in black.His face had changed, and he was backing away.\"I have a question. How did you find me when I was hidden outside the valley?\"Su Mo asked as the question had suddenly come to him.\"My Martial Soul is Clairaudient Beast with super hearing, and I can hear everything within two miles, even the sound of a fly shaking its wings.\"The youth in black asked, \"Can I leave now?\"\"I see!\"Su Mo nodded stealthily. There were a great variety of Martial Souls. No one should be underestimated. Su Mo looked at the youth and scoffed, \"I said there was no chance left for you. You were meant to die since you planned to monopolize the Jadeglow Grass.\"If they had not been reckless with greed to possess the Jadeglow Grass, they would have remained alive.Without another word, Su Mo's figure turned into a residual shadow and rushed out.The youth in black was frightened and desperate. He tried to turn around and run away but was caught instantly and killed with one fist.He did not even get a chance to call for help from elders of the Sect.Before his death, there existed only endless repentance in his mind.If they had not been avid to keep the Jadeglow Grass, they would not have died.The two had just joined Gale Island with a promising future where they could ride on the crest of success. But now they had fallen down into the abyss.They died and all disappeared in a flash.\"How weak they are!\"Su Mo shook his head. The martial artists at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm could not take one fist from him. Maybe only the martial artists in the Spiritual Martial Realm could be his opponents.\"Could their blood essence at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm help me break through my cultivation?\"Su Mo sat cross-legged on the ground and released his Devouring Martial Spirit. The inky vortex was hanging behind him and their blood essence turned into blood ray, melting into the vortex.He mercilessly swallowed their Martial Souls, both at Rank 7 Human Class.\"Sure enough, the Blood Qi of the martial artists at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm is powerful.\"Su Mo's whole body shook once the Blood Qi entered his body. Their Blood Qi in the blood essence was so tremendous, like great rivers running through Su Mo's meridians.Su Mo heightened his focus and made great efforts to cultivate it.The tremendous Blood Qi was refined into genuine Qi and finally mingled into Su Mo's elixir field.Within 15 minutes, the genuine Qi in Su Mo's elixir field broke through the limit and the bottleneck of cultivation.Boom!Su Mo's elixir field expanded rapidly. His whole elixir field was full of the genuine Qi which was exponentially increased.A spirit much higher than Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm blasted up from Su Mo's body with a loud crash.Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm!After a short while, Su Mo cultivated all the Blood Qi and stood up with brightness shining in his eyes.\"Ha ha! With my current strength, none of the new disciples could be my opponent!\"Great joy winged Su Mo's spirit.He ferreted out two storage pouches from the two mummies.Normal martial artists of the Qi Cultivation Realm could not afford storage rings. Usually, they used storage pouches.In their storage pouches, there were more than 150kg of gold, over 30 Demonic Cores, three scrolls as well as some clothes.Among them, over 20 Demonic Cores were above Lv 7 of the Qi Cultivation Realm.Su Mo took out the three scrolls and glanced through them. They were martial arts techniques all above Upper Lv 1. Although of no big use for himself, he could exchange for some contribution points with the Sect.Packing up the storage pouches, Su Mo then raised his head, looking deeply into the mountain and forests.\"The Qingyuan Trial Test only lasts for three days. Don't waste it. Just kill!\"Su Mo's killing desire was extremely strong. At this moment, he seemed to come back to his previous life where he was the king and would kill anyone standing in his way.He turned around and returned.He would not let the group of Ironteeth Wolves get away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was handsome with upright brows and sharp eyes.It was Su Mo himself.After a while, Su Mo opened his eyes and breathed out a mouthful of heavy air.Those wolves' blood essence improved his cultivation, and now Su Mo was almost in the middle stage of the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.After devouring all these Beast Souls and Martial Souls, his Devouring Martial Spirit still had not progressed, which was the sole pity.Su Mo felt very anxious. Based on his ability, he could remain powerful temporarily among all the new disciples, but if his Martial Soul could not be progressed, his cultivating would become slower and slower. Soon, he would be surpassed by others.Moreover, many old disciples in Gale Island were much more powerful than the new disciples. Thus, if he could not improve his cultivation, how could he compare with them?His Martial Soul could devour blood essence, but he could not depend on that to enhance his cultivation.Because he had discovered that devouring blood essence could rapidly improve his cultivation, its side-effect was also quite big.The genuine Qi inside his body would become mixed after devouring amount of blood essence. The more he devoured, the more mixed it became. If the condition continued, his elixir field would be affected.Consequently, every time after a massive of devouring essence blood, Su Mo needed some time to solidify his cultivation and condense genuine Qi as a way of protecting his elixir field.In a second, Su Mo glanced at this messed valley and left.Su Mo was not in a hurry to take the three strains of Jadeglow Grass, and he took priorities to continuously devour.The three strains of Jadeglow Grass would help him break through his realm when he achieved the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, even a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.In the woods, Su Mo, like an unstoppable Death God, killed all demonic beasts he encountered regardless of their classes.Undoubtedly, the demonic beasts he had killed were all at Lv 1, and he had never met a demonic beast of Lv 2.After Su Mo killed dozens and the night befell, he coincidently met Li Feng.Now, Li Feng was in disorder. His face was pale, clothes broken, and blood all over his body. What was worse, his Qi was weaker.As Li Feng ran into the wood, he was spitting out a mouthful of blood, which apparently showed that he was badly wounded.\"Su Mo, why are you here?\" asked Li Feng faintly after he stopped running when seeing Su Mo.\"Li Feng, why are you injured so badly?\"Su Mo stood before Li Feng and asked in confusion without answering his question. Li Feng was very powerful so that few of the new disciples could hurt him. Did he encounter the demonic beasts of Lv 2?\"Su Mo, I...!\"Li Feng was about to reply to him when his face changed, and a mouthful of blood escaped from his lips.Li Feng fell down onto the ground, unconscious.\"What...\"Su Mo was in shock. Hurriedly, he examined his body and found that Li Feng was severely wounded.Three of his ribs were broken, and his internal organs were badly wounded. If he was not treated, he would not survive for two days.Su Mo sighed and thought. \"Since I met him, I won't let him die.\"Li Feng was arrogant but also kind. Su Mo did not have a history with him.Su Mo held Li Feng up and took him to a nearby cave.Su Mo had killed the demonic beast in it, so the cave was very safe.Placing Li Feng next to the wall, Su Mo helped him take a healing elixir and activated genuine Qi to enter into his body in order to make the elixir more effective and stabilize his wounds.After the elixir was in effect, Li Feng remained in a coma. Hence, Su Mo had to continuously activate genuine Qi to cure him.The process lasted for a night.When the next day came and Su Mo almost ran out his genuine Qi for the third time, Li Feng finally woke up.\"Su Mo, thank you for saving my life,\" said Li Feng gratefully.His eyes flashed with a complex feeling.These days, Li Feng had treated Su Mo as a competitor. Out of expectation, Su Mo saved his life this time.\"We're in the same sect, so don't be so polite!\"Su Mo shook his head and asked, \"Li Feng, why are you injured so badly? Who hurt you?\"After an examination, Su Mo had known that Li Feng was injured by a martial artist, not by demonic beasts.\"It's Huang Yunqing who bashed me up,\" said Li Feng angrily and his eyes were full of rage.\"Who is Huang Yunqing?\" asked Su Mo in confusion while he was sitting cross-legged to recover his genuine Qi.\"Huang Yunqing is one of the eight martial artists in the Spiritual Martial Realm. His Martial Soul is of the Rank 7 Human Class, lower than the five geniuses, but he's also entered the Spiritual Martial Realm. In a word, he's greatly powerful,\" said Li Feng.\"Why did he attack you? Did he want to grab your Demonic Cores?\" Su Mo asked again.\"Yeah!\"Li Feng nodded his head and said, \"But he didn't snatch my Demonic Cores for himself.\"\"Not for himself?\" Su Mo was confused. If snatching the Demonic Cores was not for himself, who was it for?\"Su Mo, you don't know the situation, do you?\"Li Feng shook his head and continued, \"The new disciples have entered into different groups. Except for the mysterious Luo Qianfan, the other four geniuses have roped many people in and ordered them to snatch Demonic Cores for them.\"\"They've snatched the Demonic Cores from everywhere and no one could stop them. Huang Yunqing has been roped in by Wu Kui.\"Su Mo furrowed his brows, never thinking that the four could make such a move.If so, the four geniuses would obtain Demonic Cores at a formidable speed.If so, Su Mo was even harder to enter into the top five, let alone the top one.Su Mo wondered why Huang Yunqing, a martial artist at the Spiritual Martial Realm, was willing to work for Wu Kui.Only eight of 500 new disciples reached the Spiritual Martial Realm. It had to admit that if things went smoothly, Huang Yunqing would easily enter into the top ten.What price did Wu Kui pay to draw Huang Yunqing in?\"How is your wound?\" Su Mo asked after a while.Li Feng was in dismay and discouraged. He shook his head and said, \"I was injured so badly that I can't recover in a short time. Thus, I'll give up.\"Su Mo sighed and knew that Li Feng told the truth. It would take him at least one month to recover fully.\"Under such a circumstance, you can ask the elders to take you back!\"After a moment, Su Mo recovered most of his genuine Qi. Standing up and looking outside the cave, he said with his eyes full of fine light, \"Don't worry. I'll avenge you.\"Li Feng was stunned, then asked in shock, \"Su Mo, you want to look for them, don't you?\"Li Feng felt helpless. The four geniuses were very powerful and respectively drew many disciples in, so Su Mo was asking to die.\"Do you think so?\"Su Mo squinted his eyes and wore a thought-provoking smile on the corner of his lips.Of course, Su Mo was not for avenging Li Feng for their relationship was not that good.He wanted to grab Demonic Cores for himself. Robbing would be much quicker than hunting.As long as he could obtain enough Demonic Cores, he would be the top one in the trial test. 300 contribution points were quite attractive to him.As for devouring demonic beasts' blood essence, he had enough time to hunt down demonic beasts after the trial test.Moreover, if someone was not smart enough and stood in his way, Su Mo would also devour his blood essence, which was the same effect as the demonic beasts.\"Alright, I gotta go and you take care!\"Su Mo did not say anything more and turned around, leaving the shocked Li Feng behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was hunting demonic beasts while he tried to find traces of Wu Kui and the others.Along the way, Su Mo ran across a couple of disciples who were hunting demonic beasts alone.Their cultivation was all at Lv 7 or Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was not high compared with Su Mo's, so when feeling Su Mo's cultivation, they hurriedly ran away at once like the frightened birds.Su Mo felt speechless about that. He did not run after them to make a robbery because it was not significant for Su Mo.So far, Su Mo had gotten many Demonic Cores, and almost 150 of their levels were above Class 7 Lv 1.By such a score, 150 Demonic Cores, he could definitely be in the front rank.However, Wu Kui and other three geniuses had roped a lot of disciples in. The speed that they got Demonic Cores was certainly far beyond him.Thus, only to rob them could Su Mo get the first place in this trial test.If other disciples knew what Su Mo was thinking, they would agree with Li Feng that Su Mo had been out of his mind.A martial artist of the Qi Cultivation Realm was going to plunder a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm? Besides, most of them were in the Spiritual Martial Realm, but he was alone.However, Su Mo was confident in his own abilities without any fear.It would not be a problem for Su Mo to be their enemy. Su Mo was very clear that Wu Kui and Yan Qi had wanted to kill him long ago, so if there was a chance to kill them, Su Mo would do it without hesitation.Having searched for about an hour in the mountains and forests, Su Mo did not find any trace of Wu Kui or the others. He could not start his robbery plan, which made him feel depressed.\"If encountering other disciples, I'll ask them!\" Su Mo said in his heart.\"Hum?\"At this moment, Su Mo heard an insolent and indistinct laughter from far away.\"Were they Wu Kui, Huang Yunqing, and their fellows?\"Su Mo's eyes lightened. He immediately pulled back his breath and cautiously rushed toward the place where the laughter came.Su Mo behaved very carefully although he was not afraid of Wu Kui and his men. After all, there were two martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm among them. His cautious action was very necessary.Soon Su Mo saw a group of young men.However, they were not Wu Kui and his followers.At this moment, a young man in purple was surrounded by nine juniors in an opening place among the trees.Among the nine teenagers, the lowest one was even at Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm and three of them were at Lv 9.Su Mo knew one of them, Yan Xing, who was a disciple of the Yan clan, the same as Yan Qi. Yan Xing was also one of the three people of Lv 9.The young man they encircled was also at Lv 9. However, he had a pale face with a trace of blood hanging from his lips. Obviously, after a conflict with them, he was hurt.\"Haha! Zhou Xin, now here are three options for you. First, hand over all of your Demonic Cores. Second, pay allegiance to brother Yan Qi, but also hand over Demonic Cores. Third, we'll kill you, and then plunder all your belongings.\"At this point, Yan Xing made an insolent laughter again with an arrogant face.Zhou Xin looked depressed. He was at the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm and any of them could not defeat him. But two fists were no match for four fists, and he was injured by one joint strike from them.\"Guys, although Yan Qi is powerful, you're also geniuses. Are you willing to be driven by him?\" Zhou Xin did not answer Yan Xing, but looked at the several people standing by Yan Xing and seriously asked.\"Zhou Xin, our talents are far worse than brother Yan Qi's. Only brother Yan Qi can help us realize our ambitions in Gale Island,\" a stony-faced junior next to Yan Xing said.\"Only Yan Qi can help you realize your ambitions?\"Zhou Xin disdainfully smiled and shook his head. \"Wang Lei, as a genius, you're actually willing to be a lackey for others. Shame on you!\"Zhou Xin looked down upon these people. When choosing to yield, they had no dignities anymore.\"You're asking to die!\"Hearing the words, the stony-faced junior was enraged. He was going to kill Zhou Xin.\"Well, Zhou Xin, if you want to know why they sought refuge with brother Yan Qi, I can tell you why, and this is also a chance for you.\"Yan Xing shook his head to stop the stony-faced junior and said to Zhou Xin. \"Because, as long as they go and seek refuge with brother Yan Qi, they can join Sky Alliance.\"\"Joining Sky Alliance?\"Zhou Xin was stunned for a moment but then understood.Su Mo did not hide far away. When he heard the words of Yan Xing, a wisp of bright light flashed in his eyes.He did not expect that Yan Qi actually had such a big energy.It was by the power of Sky Alliance that he could rope so many people in.Su Mo had heard of Sky Alliance.Sky Alliance was an organization among the disciples in Gale Island, and its force was very powerful.Gale Island had more than 10,000 disciples. And it also had no fewer than 100 large and small groups, among which Sky Alliance was the most powerful.Countless disciples were proud to join Sky Alliance, and countless disciples had always dreamed to join Sky Alliance.The leader of Sky Alliance was the first core disciple, Duan Jingtian.Duan Jingtian's achievement was just like the meaning of his name. With a great cultivation and an excellent talent, he was the pride of Gale Island, adored by numerous disciples.It was said that his Martial Soul was the Earth Class Martial Soul, and he had reached the Spiritual Martial Realm at 12. Moreover, he had broken through the Spiritual Martial Realm into the True Spirit Realm at 20.Now, he was only 22, but he had been invincible among all the disciples in Gale Island.Duan Jingtian and other three peerless geniuses from other three big Sects were known as \"Four Talents of Skymoon Country\". They had been well-known throughout Skymoon Country.Su Mo had heard of the fame of Four Talents of Skymoon Country a long time ago, but since Sunnywood City was remote and uninformed, there was little news about them.After coming to Gale Island, Su Mo knew that Duan Jingtian, the first core disciple of Gale Island, was one of them, ranking the third place among them.As an organization created by Duan Jingtian, Sky Alliance was greatly reputable in Gale Island and was a great attraction for the ordinary disciples.Su Mo shook his head. Now that Yan Qi had promised such a good benefit, no wonder many disciples were willing to follow him.\"Zhou Xin, the elder brother of Senior Brother Yan Qi is an Inner Disciple, and he's also an important member of Sky Alliance. If you join us, you'll also become a member of Sky Alliance. Don't miss the chance.\"At this time, another person also tried to persuade Zhou Xin, and he was obviously familiar with Zhou Xin.\"If joining you, I'll be a member of Sky Alliance?\"Hearing that, Zhou Xin raised his eyebrows and struggled in his heart.He really wanted to join Sky Alliance, but as a martial artist, he had always upheld the belief that he would rather die than yield, and that he fearlessly and bravely moved forward.But now, if he yielded to join Sky Alliance, it would go against his belief in his martial arts.However, to be a member of Sky Alliance was a big temptation for him.Struggling for a long time in his heart, at last, Zhou Xin bit his teeth, shook his head, and said, \"I won't go and seek refuge with Yan Qi. If I want to join Sky Alliance in the future, I'll make it by my own abilities.\"Zhou Xin's voice was very firm. He could not go against his belief in his martial arts, and he was also confident of his talent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After hearing Zhou Xin's words, he praised him in his heart.Faced with such a dilemma, he could directly reject the temptation of Sky Alliance.With such a good disposition, he would definitely grow into an outstanding person someday as long as he did not die young.\"Zhou Xin, you're a talent, so I tried to persuade you, but you don't know how to appreciate favors!\"However, hearing the words of Zhou Xin, Yan Xing went extremely angry but gave a smile full of killing desire. \"You'll join Sky Alliance with your own abilities in the future? Do you think you still have a future?\"Zhou Xin felt scared and gloomily said, \"What? Are you really going to kill me?\"\"Yes, now that you don't want to submit, you'll be our enemy, and death will be the only result for our enemy!\"Looking proud and overbearing, Yan Xing ordered others. \"You, kill him together.\"Hearing the order, everyone struck at once. Suddenly all kinds of palm print, saber radiance and sword Qi exploded and flooded toward Zhou Xin.In the face of so many attacks, Zhou Xin felt his blood frozen and constantly dodged instead of resisting.However, there were too many attacks, and Zhou Xin could not dodge them all. Before long, after suffering several more, he was hurt worse.Unless something happened, Zhou Xin would soon be killed here.Even if now Zhou Xin shouted for the elders' help, when the elders arrived, he would already be dead.Shaking his head, Su Mo decided to help him. If Zhou Xin, with such a good disposition, died here, that would be a pity!Moreover, Yan Xing and his fellows were Su Mo's enemies. Su Mo would like to mess up their plans.He picked up an egg-sized stone from the ground and threw it out.Whoosh!The stone split the air and flew toward Yan Xing, with a harsh noise.\"Who is attacking me?\"Yan Xing leaned to one side and dodged the stone before it approached him.Presently Yan Xing saw a cyan-clothed young man walking out of the woods.His appearance lightened Yan Xing's eyes, and Yan Xing could not help laughing. \"Haha, it's you, Su Mo. I'm looking for you! But unexpectedly, now you're presenting yourself!\"Yan Xing was very happy because he had a grudge against Su Mo. The insult from Su Mo last time was kept in his mind all the time.Yan Qi ordered him to kill Su Mo as soon as he encountered him in this trial test.After searching for a large area in the mountains and forests, Yan Xing did not find Su Mo. However, Su Mo just showed up when he felt depressed.He wore out his iron shoes in hunting around when all the time it was easy to be found!When Su Mo came into the field, the other disciples stopped their attacks at once and vigilantly stared at Su Mo.\"Senior Brother Yan Xing, who is he? Does he have a grudge against you?\" asked a gray-clad teenager.\"He's just a nonentity. It was he that provoked brother Yan Qi and me!\" Yan Xing disdainfully said.\"Is he? He was too arrogant. I'll help you kill him.\"The young man in gray coldly smiled and made his way toward Su Mo, shouting. \"Boy, you're going to die for offending Senior Brother Yan Qi. After entering the hell, remember it's Cao Ling who kills you.\"Without saying anything, Su Mo just turned his head and glanced at the teenager in gray as if he was looking at an idiot.\"Damn it!\"Infuriated by Su Mo's eyes, Cao Ling attacked Su Mo by sweeping his palm from above.Cao Ling had reached Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, so the palm blew a strong wind.Cao Ling's palm was about to hit him, but Su Mo did not do anything as if he had been scared silly.There was a wisp of cruelty flashing in his eyes as if Cao Ling had seen the scene that he had killed Su Mo with a palm.Just then, Cao Ling's face stiffened because his hand was caught and could not move forward anymore.Su Mo raised his arm, caught his hand and asked with a smile, \"You're going to kill me?\"Su Mo's smile looked very pure as if he was really happy and was not angry with his attack.\"Yes, go to hell!\"With a cold light flashing in his eyes, Cao Ling shook his palm to try to get rid of Su Mo and attacked again.Even though he had done everything he could, he could not get free. Su Mo's hand was like a pair of iron pincers tightly clutching his hand.Soon, Cao Ling flushed, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.Even if Cao Ling was a stupid idiot, now he had understood that the boy in front of him was a very powerful expert. At least, Su Mo's strength was far more powerful than his.\"People who kill others will be killed too. Goodbye!\"Su Mo smiled, pulling Cao Ling closer, and punched him on the chest.Bang!Cao Ling softly fell down before he could scream.Everyone was shocked. They never thought that the harmless boy would kill Cao Ling in cold blood when he was smiling.\"Su Mo, you're going to die! Today, nobody can save you.\" Yan Xing roared.Cao Ling was killed without even touching him, which made him furious.\"Let's kill him together!\"Afterwards, Yan Xing shouted and was the first to attack. With his genuine Qi spurting, he threw a punch splitting the air.Hearing his words, the others struck their heaviest blows one after another.Suddenly, a variety of attacks converged into a river to flood toward Su Mo.\"Hey, Junior Brother, be careful!\"Zhou Xin immediately alerted Su Mo. He clearly knew the strength of their joint blow. The joint attack power of three martial artists of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm and five martial artists of Lv 8 was equivalent to the attack of a martial artist who was a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm and had been close to the attack of a martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Easy, these useless people can't hurt me!\"Su Mo calmly smiled.Hearing that, Zhou Xin was stunned. \"We are\u00a0Useless? This guy is too confident! Is he a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm?\"As their attack approached Su Mo, the smile on his face was suddenly replaced by an icy expression.\"Broken!\"After making a shout, Su Mo exploded his imposing manner and threw nine lightning punches.Boom! Boom! Boom!Su Mo smashed the joint strike with the first punch.The remaining eight punches were like eight shells whistling toward the eight men respectively.\"What?\"The eight were greatly frightened. Their joint and powerful blow was broken by a single punch.What was his cultivation?Besides, Su Mo also made a lightning counterattack.There was no time to think about that. They could only resist Su Mo's punches with their strongest strength.\"Ah! Ah! Ah!\"The next moment, screams sounded one after another. The five disciples of Lv 8 could not resist Su Mo's punch at all, and they were all exploded by the punches.Although the three disciples of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, including Yan Xing, blocked the punches, they all were forced back spurting blood.\"How, how could it be? You can't be so powerful!\"Lying on the ground with a scared face, Yan Xing could not accept the fact at all.He could not understand why Su Mo had such an incredible strength, impossible even for a martial artist of a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.It was obvious that the cultivation Su Mo showed was just Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someday, I'll make you pay a high price for this!\"\"Pay a high price? Do you have the ability?\" Su Mo sneered.\"Hmph! We will see!\"Yan Xing grunted, and said to the other two, \"Let's go.\"Then he turned around and was to take the two injured people to leave.This time Yan Xing had not only failed to kill Su Mo but was also wounded in the fight and lost some manpower. All of these made him very angry.However, a wise man knew when to retreat. Now he was obviously no match for Su Mo. The only thing he could do was tell Su Mo's news to Yan Qi, and it was impossible for Su Mo to be alive if Yan Qi beat him.\"Yan Xing, did I let you go?\"At this time, Su Mo suddenly shouted at the three men and stepped out to block their way.The two disciples at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm were flabbergasted and stared at Su Mo with vigilance as if they were confronted by a formidable enemy.\"Su Mo, do you dare to rob our Demonic Cores?\" Yan Xing gnashed with anger.\"What I want is not only your Demonic Cores, but actually, also your lives!\" Su Mo shook his head and said in a cold voice.\"Hahahaha!\"After being in a daze for a second, Yan Xing could not help laughing and said, \"Su Mo, you dare to kill me? Do you know the consequences of killing me?\"Yan Xing had no fear about what Su Mo said and heaped scorn on him.Just now, even though Su Mo stopped him, he only thought that Su Mo was going to rob their Demonic Cores and did not worry about his life at all.But now, Su Mo said he would kill him, which made Yan Xing instinctively feel that it was funny.\"Oh, what consequences? Tell me.\" Su Mo asked with interest, wearing a smile.\"If you kill me, there'll be no place for you to hide in Gale Island, and you'll die without a burial ground.\"Yan Xing sneered and continued to say, \"My clan has many Inner Disciples and Outer Disciples in Gale Island. What's more, there is an Outer Elder of Gale Island in my family, who has a distinguished status. After knowing all this, do you still dare to kill me?\"Then Yan Xing looked provocatively at Su Mo with a sneer.This was exactly what Yan Xing relied on. Even an ordinary Inner Disciple would not dare to kill him, let alone Su Mo.\"Your clan is really powerful. No wonder you're so confident!\"Su Mo understood why Yan Xing had nothing to fear and nodded his head.\"Well! Are you afraid? You'll die for offending me.\"A trace of pride flashed in Yan Xing's eyes. Seeing the expression of Su Mo, he thought Su Mo was afraid, and laughed. \"However, I can give you a chance. If you kneel and kowtow to apologize and promise to be my servant, I'll forgive what you've done.\"Yan Xing chuckled in his heart. \"Even if you have strong power, it's useless. Without a strong background, how can you fight with me?\"As long as Su Mo was his servant, he could have a hundred ways to torture him to death.\"What good advice! Yan Xing, you're so 'generous'!\" Su Mo grinned, revealing a line of white teeth.After hearing that, Yan Xing's eyes shone and immediately he felt very pleased. If he knew that he could master Su Mo so easily, then why should he go to all the trouble!\"Haha! It's a wise choice. Su Mo, you're indeed a smart man.\"Yan Xing laughed and suddenly shouted, \"Su Mo, kowtow to me quickly!\"Su Mo nodded and walked towards Yan Xing, saying nothing.Looking at Su Mo's behavior, Yan Xing was laughing and riding high.But the two men beside him were looking down on Su Mo. They did not expect that such a powerful person could actually be so timid and cowardly. Just a few words could scare him into kowtowing for forgiveness.Zhou Xin was also stunned by Su Mo's behavior and felt disappointed. He originally thought that Su Mo was a somebody, but his conduct was so unbearable.Even if he had powerful strength, it was useless if he was so timid and afraid of death.As Zhou Xin was disappointed, changes came suddenly. Su Mo extended his palm and grabbed Yan Xing by the neck in a flash.Su Mo's hand had great power, as if an iron tong firmly pinched Yan Xing's throat.If his hand made a slight exertion now, Yan Xing's throat would be broken.\"Hehehe!\"Yan Xing's eyes suddenly bulged and his face became red and frightening. He wanted to speak but could only make the sounds \"Hehe\" in his throat.\"Yan Xing, do you know why you'll die?\"Su Mo smiled and said, \"You'll die for your stupidity. Among the idiots I've ever met, congratulations, you top the list!\"\"He! He! He!\"Yan Xing struggled to say something, but he could not. Because of the lack of oxygen, his face had changed from red to livid.Su Mo's hand firmly pinched Yan Xing's throat, which made him stiff and lose his strength.Consternation filled Yan Xing's eyes because he knew that Su Mo could kill him easily if he had that thought.Su Mo continued to say, \"You've tried to kill me twice. Do you really think that I'll let you go and wait for you to try and kill me again?\"Actually, you have a strong background. However, for me, that's bullsh*t! What I hate most in my life is being forced. I'll kill whoever forces me, even an emperor.\"Without hesitation, Su Mo tightened in his palm, and then a clicking noise was immediately\u00a0heard. Unable to even scream, Yan Xing tilted his head and lost his breath.The shape of Yan Xing's dead body was very terrible. His eyes were like those of a dead fish and his face had already turned purple.Until Yan Xing's death, Su Mo did not give him any chance to speak.Dropping Yan Xing's corpse, Su Mo turned his eyes to the other two disciples.When they caught a glimpse of Su Mo's cold eyes, the two disciples shivered unconsciously. They began to realize that Su Mo was actually a Killer God, and how ridiculous it was that Yan Xing had wanted him to kowtow before.\"Run!\"Without any hesitation, both of them turned and ran. In just the blink of an eye, they already had run dozens of meters.They did not escape in the same direction but tacitly ran in two directions, respectively.In this way, even though Su Mo wanted to kill them, he could only kill one.However, Su Mo did not immediately chase them but glanced at Zhou Xin, and said, \"Zhou Xin, these two people wanted to kill you a moment ago, and you just let them run?\"\"Ah!\" Zhou Xin responded subconsciously and returned to his mind immediately.Just now he had been disappointed with Su Mo, but he did not expect for Su Mo to launch a brutal surprise attack and instantly kill Yan Xing without hesitation.From the beginning, he was not going to kowtow for forgiveness! It was clear that Su Mo had already decided to kill him.\"I'll chase them now! Su Mo, I'll repay you for saving me today.\"Zhou Xin looked at Su Mo gratefully and then chased one of the disciples quickly.Seeing Zhou Xin leaving, Su Mo immediately freed his Devouring Martial Spirit to devour the blood essence and Martial Souls of the dead.The reason why Su Mo let Zhou Xin kill them was just to send him away actually. He would not let Zhou Xin know the magical effect of his Martial Soul.Including Yan Xing, seven disciples had died.Their blood essences were completely devoured by Su Mo in a flash. However, only six of their Martial Souls were devoured, because Cao Lin had been dead for a long time, and the remaining Martial Soul had already faded away when Su Mo was devouring. However, it was not a pity for Su Mo.Although the levels of the Martial Souls were all above Rank 6 Human Class, these levels were still too low for him, and they had no effect on the advancement of his Devouring Martial Spirit.After devouring, Su Mo quickly took their storage pouches. Then he turned into a shadow and rushed into the forest to chase them.The direction he chose was exactly the way that one of the disciples ran.Su Mo's purpose was not to kill the man but to follow him to find Yan Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 Luo QianfanThe two men separately escaped, and Zhou Xin was chasing one of them.It was not difficult for Zhou Xin to deal with a badly wounded one whose strength was worse than his.Su Mo chased the other one who was in a neat, black dress. That one was quickly running in the forest, but not very fast, for he was also wounded.After a while, Su Mo caught up with him but did not attract his attention keeping 100 meters behind him.Since he yielded to Yan Qi, he must know where Yan Qi was. As long as he followed him, Su Mo could find Yan Qi at last.If he found Yan Qi, Su Mo could rob his Demonic Cores and even kill him.In fact, Su Mo and Yan Qi had no deep hatred. They only had a skirmish in the inn.It was just because of the skirmish that Yan Qi, in his pettiness, wanted to kill Su Mo.Su Mo was not a person fond of killing. On the contrary, he was a principled person.His faith was that, \"I will respect those who respect me and I will kill those who disrespect me.\"He would kill those who disrespected him without hesitation.Su Mo would not bully or kill those who had no grudge against him.For example, Su Mo did not kill Zhou Xin for the purpose of devouring his blood essence but saved him instead.Certainly, Su Mo looked for Yan Qi mainly for the purpose of robbing his Demonic Cores. Otherwise, he would not especially do that.After devouring the blood essence of Yan Xing and others, Su Mo's cultivation was further improved to the middle stage of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was not far from the late stage of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Such a cultivation and his body equivalent to a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm made Su Mo more confident.Now, he could not wait to fight against a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo followed the young man for miles.The young man did not know Su Mo was following. After escaping for miles and finding that no one was following, he ran in another direction.Su Mo hurried to follow.When Su Mo was considering how to deal with Yan Qi, after chasing for miles, something unexpected happened.An extremely harsh sound suddenly came.Su Mo was so startled that all his hair stood on end, and an extreme sense of fear arose in his heart. He stopped at once.Slice!At the same time, a black eagle plume arrow was shot in the position five steps away from Su Mo, and the arrow was still shaking.The arrow seemed not to kill Su Mo, but to stop him.Su Mo frowned and suddenly turned to the right.A young man stood on a hill, 100 meters high and 500 meters away from him.The young man stood with his white dress waving in the wind. He stared at Su Mo while holding a white bow in his hand.\"Luo Qianfan?\"Su Mo never thought he could meet the most mysterious Luo Qianfan among the five geniuses, and Luo Qianfan had fought against him.\"Did he want to rob my Demonic Cores?\" Su Mo thought inwardly.\"What do you mean?\"Su Mo coldly shouted with genuine Qi in his voice. Such a voice could be heard even from 1500 meters away.In the face of Su Mo's question, Luo Qianfan on the top of the hill was not angry but only smiled. \"Junior Brother, be lenient wherever it's possible. Since he's been badly wounded, why not let him go?\"Luo Qianfan's face was full of a gentle smile without any hostility to Su Mo.Su Mo paused but immediately understood that Luo Qianfan must think that he wanted to kill the young man in black.That was why Luo Qianfan gave a warning shot.\"It's none of your business.\"Su Mo shrugged and sneered.This guy was interesting because he would like to save others here.\"It's indeed none of my business!\"Luo Qianfan nodded and said, \"I'm just interested in you.\"\"Interested in me?\"Su Mo's face slightly changed with goosebumps rising and said with surprise, \"Unexpectedly, you have such a hobby? However, you'll be disappointed because I only like women!\"\"Um!\"Luo Qianfan was surprised and shook his head wordlessly. \"You think too much. I just mean I'm interested in your strength. I can feel you're the only one who can rival me among all the new disciples.\"\"Really?\"Su Mo frowned and felt amazed.Unexpectedly, Luo Qianxun could judge his strength.Besides, the way Luo Qianfan spoke obviously indicated that he paid more attention to Su Mo than the other four geniuses.Hearing Luo Qianfan's words, Su Mo was full of an uncontrollable fighting desire.A martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm was just a chance for Su Mo to test his strength.\"If you can block my three arrows, I'll consider cooperating with you.\"Seeing the fighting desire in Su Mo's eyes, Luo Qianfan smiled.\"What cooperation?\" Su Mo asked in doubt.\"If you can block my three arrows, I'll tell you, otherwise, you don't have to know,\" Luo Qianfan shook his head and said.\"OK! Come down to fight against me.\"Su Mo agreed without hesitation. Even if there was no cooperation, Su Mo wanted to fight with Luo Qianfan.As Luo Qianfan could see his strong strength, Su Mo could also judge Luo Qianfan's.\"I won't go down. Receive my arrows!\"Luo Qianfan shook his head and held a black eagle plume arrow in his hand, placed the arrow, and drew the bowstring.With the string tightened, Luo Qianfan's imposing manner greatly changed revealing his ability to the full extent. He was quite different from the gentle one before.\"What?\"Su Mo was surprised that Luo Qianfan wanted to launch an attack 500 meters from him.It was 500 meters! Although bows and arrows were long-distance weapons, an arrow might have no force here after such a long distance.The next moment, Su Mo knew he was totally wrong.Whoosh!The black eagle plume arrow, shot from the string, became a black light, instantly splitting the air with a harsh sonic boom and quickly approached Su Mo.Fast!Very fast!It was an unspeakable arrow that broke at an extreme speed through the distance of space toward Su Mo.\"What?\"Su Mo was greatly frightened because he had never seen such a fast attack.The force wave of the arrow was extremely strong and completely different from what he thought just now.Su Mo had no time to dodge, and it was also too late for Su Mo to draw his sword because the eagle plume arrow had arrived in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The strong force made Su Mo retreat several steps backward.\"He's so powerful!\"Su Mo was amazed. The force of the shot was extremely strong, almost equal to a force of over 10,000kg.The attack of the arrow was stronger than 90% of martial artists in the same realm.Although Luo Qianfan and the ninth elder Wei Guang of the Wei's were both in the Spiritual Martial Realm, the attack of Luo Qianfan's arrow was much stronger than that of Wei Guang.Su Mo only had the cultivation of Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm when Wei Guang had wanted to kill him. Thus, Wei Guang looked down on Su Mo and did not give full play to his power.\"The second shot!\"Luo Qianfan said. Three eagle plume arrows appeared in his hands at the same time.Riding his horse, Luo Qianfan pulled the three arrows on the white bow and fully stretched it in a quick, smooth motion.A cool breeze passed.Buzz!The bowstring trembled with the roar came out. The black arrow shot out from the top of the hill to Su Mo directly.The second shot came with three arrows!The force of each one of the three arrows was stronger than the former one. The three arrows vibrated and left no space for Su Mo to dodge.\"Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist!\"Su Mo did not dodge but instead threw a punch with both fists. The fist force was as strong as that of sea waves. It flowed constantly to kill most of the force of the three arrows. Then, he threw another punch to beat back the three arrows.Su Mo's eyes were just like lightning, full of fighting desire.Su Mo had been unfavorable in face of the shot before only because he was caught off guard.Now, he would not fail because he was well prepared.\"So I'm right that your cultivation can fend against the attack of half my strength!\"Luo Qianfan smiled and warned, \"However, I'll apply 80% of my strength in the last shot. If you can't fend against it, you may die. Do you want to continue?\"\"Half of his strength?\"Su Mo frowned, and thought, \"Such a strong attack is only half his strength?\"But Su Mo had also only applied half his strength to fend against the second shot!\"Bring it on!\"Su Mo nodded with a dignified expression.Whoosh!At the top of the hill, Luo Qianfan suddenly jumped up like an eagle stretching its wings and rushing into the high sky.The next moment, his body paused in the sky, overlooking Su Mo. A new black eagle plume arrow appeared in his hand.This arrow was huge. It was about two meters long and as thick as a child's arm. It seemed to be more a spear than an arrow.With the arrow in his hand, Luo Qianfan roared. He opened the bow and pulled the arrow. It became a flash of black lightning and shot towards Su Mo.Yes! It was a kill!The big arrow was extremely fast like a drill in the air. It rotated at a high speed to form a whirlwind breaking the air.Su Mo stood still. His clothes were blown by the strong wind and his face became grim.The strength of the shot was more than twice stronger than that of the last shot.Whoosh!Su Mo unsheathed his long sword, with shining radiance.Su Mo held the sword and injected genuine Qi into it so that the sword was full of radiance.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"Su Mo shouted and waved his sword.All the force of Su Mo's body burst out and his blood was surging.Su Mo used the sword to repel Luo Qianfan's shot.With a fierce wind, the sword radiance hit the huge arrow.Su Mo had wanted to test whether his current strength could fend against a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm.Though Luo Qianfan was not a common martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm.Bang!The sword radiance hit the huge arrow, causing a loud explosive sound. Everything shook. Endless airflow swept the place, sending the sand, stones, grass, and trees surrounding Su Mo in every direction.After a short while, the smoke slowly faded away.Luo Qianfan had fallen onto the branch of a huge tree.He stared at the site. In fact, he had not known whether Su Mo could fend against such a shot. He had once killed a Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist with it.Although he had only used 80% of his strength, a martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm could not fend against his shot, never mind Su Mo, at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.After the smoke faded away, the site was a big mess. A tall figure appeared.\"Haha! This is fun!\"Su Mo smiled, looking at Luo Qianfan.Su Mo was dirty and his clothes had been torn by the strength. He looked like a drowned rat.However, he has not wounded aside from his arm which held the sword. It was a little limp and numb from the strong force.\"Great!\"Seeing Su Mo's tall and straight figure and even stronger momentum, Luo Qianfan knew that Su Mo was not hurt. He admired him.He had never thought that a martial artist with Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm could have such strong strength.Even a common martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm might not be as good as him!\"Haha! Luo Qianfan, do you want to go on?\"Su Mo asked loudly, with insistent fighting desire in his eyes.Luo Qianfan jumped down from the tree. Shaking his head, he said, \"No, your strength isn't worse than mine.\"Su Mo nodded. Since Luo Qianfan did not want to continue, Su Mo could only agree with him.Only the three shots had given Su Mo a clear idea of his own strength.\"You said that you'll cooperate with me. What did you mean? Tell me.\" Su Mo asked.Although Luo Qianfan had stopped him from tracking the man in black, Su Mo did not hate him at all.Luo Qianfan nodded and asked, \"Well, what's your name?\"\"Su Mo!\" Su Mo answered.Luo Qianfan muttered to himself and said, \"Junior Brother Su Mo, I found an underground demon cave in the center of Qingyuan Island, where there are a lot of demonic beasts and Spiritual Herbs.\"But because there are many strong Lv 2 demonic beasts in the cave, I can't defeat them alone.\"So I want to explore the cave with you. If we go together, we can get a lot of Demonic Cores and many Spiritual Herbs.\"What do you think?\"Luo Qianfan asked, staring at Su Mo.\"The underground demon cave?\"Su Mo frowned and asked, \"Have you entered the cave? What Spiritual Herbs are there? How many demonic beasts are there?\"Su Mo did not hurry to answer Luo Qianfan because he was not familiar with him.\"I've entered, but not very deep. I found more than four Spiritual Herbs outside the cave, but I retreated quickly because I was sieged by five Class 1 Lv 2 demonic beasts, and a Class 9 Lv 1 demonic beast.\"\"So many demonic beasts! And they are all Lv 2!\"Su Mo was surprised, thinking that the demon cave presented both opportunities and risks. He asked again, \"What are the demonic beasts?\"\"They are worm-like beasts!\"\"Worm-like demonic beasts? What kind of worm?\" Su Mo was curious.\"They are the size of a human head, which I've never heard of. Their whole body is black and hard like iron, with wings.\" Luo Qianfan was worried. These demonic beasts were so strong that Luo Qianfan could not underestimate them.Su Mo was silent. He had never heard of such demonic beasts.However, in Su Mo's view, it would be of great value to obtain the Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Cores from the demon cave.Although the demon cave was dangerous, they could escape easily if they were defeated.\"OK! I'll fight with you!\" Su Mo said to Luo Qianfan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do the others also know?\"Su Mo frowned and asked, looking at the crowd.\"Hm, this underground demon cave was discovered by two new disciples, but they were too scared to enter. Later on, I passed by and entered with them. Finally, we escaped from the cave together.\"Luo Qianfan nodded and said in resignation, \"It seems that the two disciples leaked the news.\"\"Let's go take a look,\" Su Mo said and walked over with Luo Qianfan.There was a two-meter-wide cave in the middle of the valley against a stone cliff. All the thistles and thorns growing around its entrance had been cleared away, revealing the mysterious cave.A crowd of youths surrounded the entrance and camped out in four groups.\"Who are you?\"One of the youths yelled when they saw Su Mo and his companion.When everyone saw Su Mo and his partner's faces, they were all surprised with glints in their eyes.Most of them probably did not know Su Mo, but they recognized Luo Qianfan, one of the five great geniuses.\"Get out of my way!\" Luo Qianfan said coldly, glancing at the crowd.The youths looked at each other. A stocky youth stepped forward reluctantly and said, \"Senior Brother Luo, this place has already been claimed by the other four great geniuses. I suggest you go elsewhere!\"\"Claimed by the four great geniuses?\" asked Luo Qianfan with a darkened expression.Su Mo was also very surprised. He had not expected that the four great geniuses besides Luo Qianfan had all arrived.With all the five great geniuses here, there was bound to be a series of battles!\"Yes. Senior Brother Wu Kui, Yan Qi, Cao Yuan, and Senior Sister Feng Zilan are all inside. They've ordered us to prevent anyone from entering, so please leave,\" said the youth respectfully.He nervously watched Luo Qianfan's expression.Luo Qianfan was one of the five great geniuses and a prominent figure in the Spiritual Martial Realm, so the youth was too afraid to force him to leave.He had already sworn his loyalty to Wu Kui. Since Wu Kui had given him orders, he had no choice but to block Luo Qianfan.\"Get out of my way!\" Shouted Luo Qianfan bluntly, glaring at the crowd with steely eyes.Everyone felt a strong force sweeping towards them, making them quicken their breathing.None of these people had high cultivation because their stronger companions had all entered the cave with the four great geniuses. Everyone left behind was only at Lv 7 or Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.After a moment, they all gritted their teeth and scattered to make way for Luo Qianfan, afraid to confront him.If this prominent figure of the Spiritual Martial Realm was enraged, none of them would withstand his wrath.Luo Qianfan rushed impatiently into the cave with no regard for Su Mo.With the four great geniuses inside, he needed to enter as soon as possible, or he would get nothing at all. He knew exactly how many Spiritual Herbs were inside.After Luo Qianfan entered the cave, Su Mo also tried to enter, too.\"Stop right there!\"The stocky youth blocked Su Mo with his body and said coldly, \"This place has been closed off. Who allows you to enter?\"Su Mo raised his brow and pointed at Luo Qianfan, who was deep inside the cave, and said, \"Didn't you let him in?\"\"Ha ha! He's one of the five great geniuses, an expert of the Spiritual Martial Realm. Who do you think you're in comparison to him? Get out!\" Scoffed the stocky youth mockingly.The stocky youth saw that Luo Qianfan had entered the cave without any regard for Su Mo, so he thought that the two were not close.\"So this is due to ability.\" Thought Su Mo.\"I'm giving you three breaths to disappear from my sight, or I'll kill you,\" Su Mo indifferently said with a cold expression.\"What?\"The stocky youth was stunned and said mockingly, \"You must really think you're an expert of the Spiritual Martial Realm! I want to see how you can kill anyone with so many of us here!\"The stocky youth was not worried at all. There were over 20 men who were at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, so even a martial artist at the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm was not a match for them.\"Die!\"Su Mo's eyes flashed with killing desire, and he swung his fist.Boom!The stocky youth was struck forcefully by Su Mo's fist, and his body exploded into multiple pieces.The crowd was shocked and speechless. No one had expected Su Mo to be so violent, smashing a martial artist at the Peak of Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm into pieces due to a single disagreement.After killing the youth, Su Mo strolled into the cave.He intentionally killed a man with a single blow to scare the others, so that he would not have to face them all. No matter how fearless he was, he still could not kill dozens of men at once!Su Mo entered the cave and found it slope downwards and gradually widen.After walking for about 15 minutes and one kilometer, he finally arrived in a large underground space.This space was so immense that he could not see the edges, and it was countless times larger than the underground world Su Mo had found in Breezewind Mountain.This underground world was dark, and the cold air had a rotting scent to it.Su Mo looked around and had not found anyone, not even Luo Qianfan.Luo Qianfan originally wanted to ally with Su Mo, but when he found out that the four great geniuses were in the cave already, he did not need Su Mo anymore and decided to act on his own.Su Mo had no choice but to venture forward carefully on his own.This space was deep and dark, and although a couple pieces of jade on the ground gave off a faint light, they did not provide much visibility.After walking for a while, Su Mo saw a dozen insect carcasses on the ground.They were large black insects the size of a human head covered in hard shells. They had long mouths and menacing fangs as sharp as knives.There were also the corpses of three martial artists, obviously new disciples of Gale Island.They must have fallen under the giant insects' attack.Su Mo felt the residual heat on these people's bodies, which meant that they had just died. He released his Martial Soul and began to devour.The three people's Martial Souls and the black insects' Beast Souls had already disappeared, leaving only some blood behind, which Su Mo devoured entirely.Due to the time of their death, most of the energy in their blood essence was gone.All three men were at Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, and those giant insects were demonic beasts at Class 9 Lv 1. Even if their energy was mostly gone, the devouring still made Su Mo's cultivation increase greatly to the late stage of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.\"Ha ha, these corpses are treasures to me!\"Su Mo smiled and continued venturing into the deep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe underground world was massive. Su Mo wandered for less than an hour without reaching the end.He did not run into any danger or any other people.However, Su Mo occasionally spotted some fresh corpses of new disciples and black Demonic Insects.Su Mo obviously could not let these blood essence go to waste, so he devoured the essence of all the corpses he saw.He could devour a large amount of blood essence without much effort. This was much faster than killing demonic beasts for their essence.However, the Demonic Cores of these Demonic Insects had already been taken away. Su Mo also did not see any Spiritual Herbs, and he guessed that this was probably because the great geniuses had already taken them.Su Mo was not worried. Even if he did not find any Spiritual Herbs or Demonic Cores, he was already happy with a large amount of blood essence he had.As long as he could continue to improve his cultivation and strengthen his abilities, he was not worried about not having Demonic Cores!\"Lv 2 Demonic Insects?\"Suddenly, Su Mo's eyes brightened as he saw a couple more corpses. There were the corpses of three Demonic Insects and two martial artists.The three Demonic Insects were twice the size of previous ones he had seen, and they were as large as a cow's head.Su Mo was overjoyed and swiftly ran forward to devour.Although the three Demonic Insects did not have as much blood essence as the two martial artists, the amount of their Blood Qi was about seven or eight times that of the martial artists.After Blood Qi entered his body, Su Mo rushed to cultivate, and his cultivation soared once again.Soon, he had progressed from late-stage of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm to peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, and there was still a large amount of Blood Qi in his body that had not been cultivated.Su Mo sat down to cultivate the Blood Qi and refine his genuine Qi.With the support of such strong Blood Qi, even if he did not directly break through the bottleneck to the Spiritual Martial Realm, he would at least achieve a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.For the martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm, the genuine Qi in their bodies had already changed into congenital genuine Qi.The so-called half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm meant a transitional period and not an actual realm.For the martial artists at a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm, their genuine Qi was turning into congenital genuine Qi, but they had not entered the Spiritual Martial Realm. However, they were still much stronger than the martial artists of Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, so this period was called a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.The strong Blood Qi had been turned into genuine Qi, and the genuine Qi turned into a mist and filled Su Mo's entire elixir field. There was endless genuine Qi flooding into his meridians.A large amount of genuine Qi stretched Su Mo's elixir field to the point of discomfort, and he tried extremely hard to compress the genuine Qi.When the amount of genuine Qi in Su Mo's elixir field reached a certain boundary, the center of the genuine Qi suddenly collapsed, forming a vortex.The genuine Qi vortex slowly turned, drawing in all the genuine Qi in the elixir field, and the vortex gradually widened.After a while, Su Mo had completely cultivated all the devoured Blood Qi, and all the genuine Qi in his elixir field had been absorbed into the vortex. The genuine Qi vortex had increased greatly in size and took up almost half of Su Mo's elixir field.The vortex is made from genuine Qi which is so compressed that it is almost liquid.Suddenly, wisps of congenital genuine Qi appeared from the center of the vortex and mixed into the genuine Qi.A half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm!Then, Su Mo violently opened his eyes, and they shot out two bright beams of light in the dark space.\"Time to get Demonic Cores and Spiritual Herbs!\"Su Mo clenched his fists and felt his strength greatly increase. He smiled.Now that his cultivation had reached a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm, there was no need for him to devour large amounts of blood essence anymore.Even if he found large amounts of essence, he would not devour them.In under two days, Su Mo had devoured a giant amount of blood essence, and his cultivation had increased from peak Lv 8 Qi cultivation Realm to a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.He had to rest for a while and refine his genuine Qi before making more breakthroughs.When cultivating the \"Primordial Qi Method\", Su Mo felt that his Primordial Genuine Qi was very pure and refined. But now, the genuine Qi in his body was messy and crude.If he broke through into the Spiritual Martial Realm under these circumstances, that would affect the foundation of his martial arts, so he did not want to rashly break through.Su Mo sighed and drifted forward like a ghost.After walking for a couple miles, Su Mo felt a strong wave of genuine Qi in front of him, followed by a series of rumbling sounds. He was startled and hurried to conceal his Qi so that he could prowl ahead.Soon, Su Mo saw a mountain of hundreds of giant black insects crazily attacking a group of young men.There were over 20 people, and Su Mo saw the four great geniuses, including Yan Qi, Wu Kui, Feng Zilan, and Luo Qifan was also among them.In front of them stood a tree that was over 333.3 meters tall. The trunk was as thick and strong as a pillar, and it grew from the floor of the underground world straight into the top of the rocky mountain.On the trunk were many gray scabs that were as large as watermelons, which coated the tree's branches.Su Mo looked closely and noticed that there were signs of life in every gray scab, revealing that they were all insect eggs.Here had to be the breeding site of the black Demonic Insects.There were not only many insect eggs on the tree, but there were also nine red fruits as large as fists on the branches. The fruits gave off a red glow, and Su Mo could smell their light fragrance from more than 100 meters away.\"What kind of spirit fruit is that?\"Su Mo's eyes lit up. Although he did not recognize the fruit, he knew that they were no ordinary objects or these people could not be here.These men were obviously trying to get the spirit fruits, which is why they were attacked by the insects.Su Mo did not rush up to seize them, and instead, he carefully observed the battle.There were at least 10 Lv 2 Demonic Insects in the crowd, and three of them were class 2 Lv 2 demonic beasts, which were equal to a martial artist of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.Most of the Demonic Insects were Class 9 Lv 1 Demonic Beasts, and even the lowest ones were Class 8 Lv 1.These 20 new disciples were also not weak. All eight of the Spiritual Martial Realm experts were present, including the five great geniuses.The rest mostly were at peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, and some had even reached a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.However, they were still no match for the Demonic Insects.Many of them were injured and on the verge of death.Luo Qianfan was dealing with one of the Class 2 Lv 2 Demonic Beasts, and Wu Kui, Cao Yuan, and others were dealing with the other two.Although the three Demonic Beasts were temporarily restrained, no one could deal with the other Class 1 Lv 2 Demonic Beasts, which were striking down man after man.The Demonic Insects had hard shells that required a large amount of force to break through, and they had sharp incisors that could tear off a large piece of flesh with one bite.\"Huang Yunqing, block it so I can get the Empty Spirit Fruit!\" yelled Wu Kui towards a tall young man who was battling a Class 2 Lv 2 Demonic Insect with him.Then he turned around, abandoned the Demonic Beast, and rushed towards the giant tree.\"Brother Wu, I...\"Huang Yunqing was startled, but he had no time to finish his thought. The Demonic Insect struck again with its menacing incisors, which gave off a cold light.\"Huff!\"Huang Yunqing yelled and released his Martial Soul, using all his force to block the Demonic Insect's attack.His Martial Soul was a Cyan Feather Bird with piercing eyes and fierce glow.He pushed his Martial Soul to use all its strength. Although it was not a match for the Demonic Insect, it barely held it off.Wu Ku hurried towards the giant tree and soon approached it. When he saw the nine red fruits on the treetop, his heart raced with excitement.He was about to jump onto the three when a loud scream sounded behind him.Wu Kui was startled and turned to his side as a dark flash sped past him.It was an arrow!\"Luo Qianfan, what are you doing?\"Wu Kui turned around and glared at Luo Qianfan, who had shot the arrow.\"Wu Kui, are you trying to take all the Empty Spirit Fruits for yourself?\"Luo Qianfan chuckled as he fought the Demonic Insect.Luo Qianfan was very powerful, and the Class 2 Lv 2 Demonic Insect could barely contend with him. Now that he was using his full force, he was able to kill the Demonic Insect in no time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Qianfan was very powerful, and his bow also gave him an edge.Since he could launch an attack within 1,000 meters, no one could grab the Empty Spirit Fruits under his watch.\"How is that possible? I won't do that.\"Wu Kui remained calm and roared. \"Shouldn't you know the situation? If we don't pick them up right away, we'll probably be eaten by Demonic Insects with time passing. After I pick them up and get out of here, we can distribute them.\"Though Wu Kui's expression was unchanged and said something upright, he secretly scolded them in his heart.He was ready to have all Empty Spirit Fruits for himself.As long as he picked those Empty Spirit Fruits up, he would leave here immediately. He did not care about others at all.After the words, Wu Kui immediately flew to the huge tree to pick the Empty Spirit Fruits.\"Wu Kui, stop it!\"Another yell followed. Then, Yan Qi repelled two demonic beasts of Class 1 Lv 2 away, got himself out of the fighting ring, and also flew to the tree.Yan Qi wanted to contend with Wu Kui for the Empty Spirit Fruits.In the distance, Su Mo felt nervous upon witnessing the scene. He did not make a move because he believed that Luo Qianfan would stop them.They fought together to deal with the Demonic Insects, but each of them wanted to get more fruits, so they also fought for themselves and stayed alerted to each other.As expected, seeing them almost pick the fruits, Luo Qianfan's eyes became cold. He immediately stepped back, leaving a distance between him and the Demonic Insects.Whoosh!At the same time, five eagle plume arrows appeared in his hand.Pew!After he stretched his bow and fixed the arrows, the five arrows were popped out in unison. Instantly, they were transformed to black light and rushed at Wu Kui and Yan Qi.Three of them were rushing at Wu Kui, leaving the last two towards Yan Qi.\"Jerk!\"Both Wu Kui and Yan Qi stretched out their hands and almost touched the Empty Spirit Fruits. Right at this time, they were attacked by Luo Qianfan and became enraged.But no matter how angry they were, they had to pull their hands back and dodge the arrows. Otherwise, they would be dead even if they had obtained the Empty Spirit Fruits.Boom! Boom!After several strikes and fists, they broke Luo Qianfan's attack.Due to the powerful attack of the arrows, they were pushed back and blown from the tree.Instantly, they fell into a battle with several fierce demonic beasts of Class 1 Lv 2.\"Ah\"At this moment, a painful scream sounded. When Huang Yunqing was in a solo battle with the Demonic Insects of Class 2 Lv 2, his neck was bitten into halves by them and he died immediately.\"Damn it!\"The crowd was startled. Huang Yunqing was dead and no one was able to stop the Demonic Insect.Seeing this, many people wanted out.They were all afraid that they would get the Empty Spirit Fruits at the expense of their lives.Dozens of disciples in the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm retreated quickly and escaped to a place far away.Swish! Swish! Swish!Seeing many disciples retreating, a few of the rest people flew to the tree without any hesitation.Cao Yuan, Feng Zilan, and the other two disciples of the Spiritual Martial Realm took the lead and flew to the tree at a formidable speed.With so many disciples fleeing the fighting scene, they had lost the chance of killing Demonic Insects, so they had to snatch the Empty Spirit Fruits as soon as possible.\"Humf!\"Since the scene was a mess, Luo Qianfan was dejected. After a humf, he also flew to the tree.Luo Qianfan was much quicker than anyone else. As he rushed to the tree, he also shot arrows towards them, causing them to dodge the arrows and slowing them down.\"Luo Qianfan, you're courting death!\" Roared the slim Feng Zilan.Her face was full of coldness as she wielded her long sword to stab toward Luo Qianfan.When Luo Qianfan attacked them, they immediately stopped to shirk the arrows. After a second, they were surrounded by Demonic Insects and fell into a fierce battle with them.\"I can't wait anymore!\"Su Mo decided to make a move. He had heard from Wu Kui that this fruit was called Empty Spirit Fruit. He did not know its effect, but it must be extremely precious since these disciples in the Spiritual Martial Realm crazily wanted to obtain them.Su Mo hid his figure and pulled his Qi back. After bypassing them and the Demonic Insects, he quickly ran to the tree.Soon, Su Mo approached the huge tree.Giving full force to his techniques, like lightning, he reached the tree.At this time, each one was fighting against a number of Demonic Insects, and they did not notice Su Mo, who had come to the tree with his hidden figure.Whoosh!In the tree, Su Mo rapidly collected an Empty Spirit Fruit. The red fruit was cold emitting a unique aroma.\"Who is it?\"An angry roar indicated that Su Mo was discovered.A fierce Sword Qi pierced through the air and rushed at Su Mo. It was a tall and sturdy young man who swayed his sword. Apparently, it was Cao Yuan himself, one of the five geniuses.\"What?\"\"You're asking to die!\"\"Get the hell off the tree!'The others also discovered Su Mo and grew furious.Just in a blink of an eye, a couple of attacks were continuously rushing at Su Mo, including sword rays, fist radiance, and the shadows of the claws.\"Damn it!\"Su Mo felt speechless and thought, \"They are really insane!\"Clang!After several sword radiances, Su Mo unsheathed his long sword and made a sword curtain before him. The sharp sword radiance smashed the attacks into millions of pieces.Su Mo was growing powerful now. Even if they fought together, Su Mo was capable of defeating them.\"You're asking to die!\"\"Hand over the fruit, or you'll die!\"They were all furious and roared. Wu Kui and Yan Qi were startled when seeing Su Mo. They had never considered Su Mo as a threat at all, but Su Mo was unexpectedly powerful.After he smashed all attacks, another round of attacks was rushing at him before he had time to collect the Empty Spirit Fruits.This round of attacks was extremely forceful. Among them, a black electrical ray pierced through the air and rushed towards Su Mo.It was an arrow, from Luo Qianfan!Meanwhile, Yan Qi and other people took the risk of being wounded and attacked Su Mo regardless of Demonic Insects.\"Sh*t!\"Su Mo's expression was changed. These overlapping attacks darkened his face.The five geniuses were all very powerful. Although their cultivations were at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, their forces were actually close to Lv 2. Besides, there were 10 more people. If all of them launched a joint attack, a martial artist of Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm could also be defeated.Moreover, Su Mo felt a little bit afraid of Luo Qianfan.Except for Luo Qianfan, Su Mo had to deal with a large number of Demonic Insects.If all the people present attacked Su Mo, it would be more difficult for him to snatch many Empty Spirit Fruits.\"Luo Qianfan, our promise remains valid,\" shouted Su Mo.Confronted with the flood-like attacks, Su Mo quickly retreated, flew from the tree, and dodged the attacks.Luo Qianfan was stunned at his words, then burst into laughter, \"Haha! Su Mo, I wish you could honor your promise!\"Luo Qianfan abruptly turned around, quickly retreated the battle, and flew away.In a blink of an eye, he was in 500 meters away.\"This...\"Su Mo, dazed and confused, thought, \"What's Luo Qianfan doing? Why did he run away?\"The others were also numb and did not know what was going on. However, before thinking twice, they all ran to the huge tree wanting to snatch the fruits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking from his 500-meter distance, he laughed confidently. \"Su Mo, today I'll show you who the King of Distant Fighting is!\"Whoosh!He dropped down, put five eagle plume arrows on the bow and drew the bow quickly.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The bowstring was buzzing, which meant that it was another five-arrow-shooting. The five arrows looked like five black rays of light. They pierced through the air and flew toward several people in the large tree.After he shot the five arrows, instead of stopping, Luo Qianfan once again placed another five sharp arrows on the bow.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!If one were to judge only from his hands, it would appear as if he was suffering convulsions. His hands were shaking so fast that people almost could not see them. The sharp arrows pierced through the air continuously, sounding like beans being fried.Volley arrows!Endless multiple arrows!Luo Qianfan shot five arrows each time and the arrows flew one after the other.The flying arrows flew toward different targets. It was as if they had eyes.The unceasing arrows were like rain, shooting into the crowd in a flurry.In order to block the arrows, several people were killed by Demonic Insects.The martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm like Yan Qi, Wu Kui, Feng Zilan and others shot back and could no longer go one step further. At the same time, they were also being attacked by Demonic Insects and had been injured.Few people could block the ferocious Class 2 Lv 2 Demonic Insects and soon several more people died.\"Sh*t! Freaking awesome!\"Su Mo was stunned and could not help saying a rude word.\"The King of Distant Fighting?\"Su Mo could not help praising him. If a martial artist in the same level fought with him and could not get close to him, he would be defenseless against this archery.\"Su Mo, you should take this opportunity to pick the fruit.\"Alerted by Luo Qianfan's words, Su Mo immediately jumped up into the big tree with a laugh and began to pick the Empty Spirit Fruits.This time, no one could stop him.He picked the eight remaining Empty Spirit Fruits one by one.Anyone who rushed toward him was blocked by the sharp arrows.Some attacking Demonic Insects were also killed by the sharp arrows. Even when several occasional Demonic Insects passed the blockade of arrows, Su Mo killed them. They were no match for him.\"Haha!\"Having successfully picked off all the Empty Spirit Fruits, Su Mo felt overjoyed. Now he could not help admiring Luo Qianfan.\"Su Mo, put the Empty Spirit Fruits down!\"\"If you dare to take them, I won't let you go after we return to Gale Island.\"Seeing that Su Mo had taken all the Empty Spirit Fruits, others shouted at him loudly, one after another with angry expressions.\"You'd better deal with the demonic beasts first! Haha!\"Su Mo laughed again, leaped down from the tree, and flew away.Su Mo soon joined Luo Qianfan, and the two quickly disappeared.\"Bastard!\"\"Sh*t...\"The others were enraged. They tried their best to get rid of the attacking Demonic Insects. At last, they escaped, leaving dozens of corpses.Under the siege of the Demonic Insects, most of them died. Only 10 were able to escape.They were four geniuses, two martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm, as well as four disciples who were half a step away to the Spiritual Martial Realm.In the cave for the exit, Su Mo and Luo Qianfan were walking side by side.\"Nine Empty Spirit Fruits, how do we divide them?\" Su Mo asked, looking at Luo Qianfan.\"We each take four. As for the remaining one, the one who wants it will pay 1,500 kilograms of gold for it. What do you think?\"Luo Qianfan said with a smile after thinking for a moment.Su Mo felt surprised. The one who wanted the extra fruit would pay 1,500 kilograms of gold for it.The value of an Empty Spirit Fruit was far beyond 1,500 kilograms of gold, possibly even twice that.\"1,500 kilos?\"Instead of answering at once, Su Mo asked, \"What are the specific functions of Empty Spirit Fruits?\"\"You don't know?\" Luo Qianfan asked in surprise.\"Nope!\"\"How about allocating these Empty Spirit Fruits first? Then I'll tell you,\" Luo Qianfan said with a deep voice.A hint of a strange light flashed in Su Mo's eyes. Luo Qianfan was not disclosing it due to a lack of trust. He was afraid that Su Mo would break the promise once he knew the functions of Empty Spirit Fruits.Su Mo did not mind. After all, they were not that familiar with each other. His cautious behavior was reasonable.\"Give you four. If you want one more, give me 2,000 kilograms of gold,\" Su Mo said with a smile, handing him four Empty Spirit Fruits.He was sure that even if he added to 2,500 kilos, Luo Qianfan would still want the fruit.\"2,000 kilograms of gold?\"Luo Qianfan thought for a moment but nodded at last, frowning. \"Deal, 2,000 kilograms.\"Although the price was very high, an Empty Spirit Fruit was worth that much.\"Here's 1,500 kilograms of gold, and a Lower Lv 2 Spiritual Herb. The herb is worth almost 500 kilograms of gold. They're all yours now.\"Luo Qianfan took out 1,500 gold tickets and a blue herb and then handed them to Su Mo.The Spiritual Qi the blue herb released was extremely rich, far beyond that of Su Mo's Jadeglow Grass. It was indeed a Lv 2 Spiritual Herb.Su Mo immediately gave him the last Empty Spirit Fruit.\"Now can you tell me?\" Su Mo asked.\"Empty Spirit Fruit is an extremely rare spiritual fruit. It's said that an Empty Spirit Fruit tree can only bear nine fruits once every 50 years.\"Luo Qianfan continued, \"It can't increase the cultivation of the martial arts, but in a short period of time, it can lead a martial artist who is under the True Spirit Realm into a state of Empty Spirit. When practicing martial arts techniques in this state, he'll get double the results by doing half the work.\"\"What? Awesome! Does it work for any martial arts techniques?\"Su Mo was shocked by the amazing function of Empty Spirit Fruits.\"Haha, it only works within a certain range of its capabilities.\"Luo Qianfan said with a smile, \"For example, I'm now at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm. If I took a fruit, I'd be able to quickly reach a very high realm when practicing any Lv 2 martial arts techniques. However, if I learned Lv 3 martial arts techniques, the effect would be greatly reduced. After all, the higher the level of the martial arts techniques are, the more difficult to practice.\"Su Mo nodded. Indeed, the higher the level the martial arts techniques were, the more difficult to cultivate.The two Lv 3 martial arts techniques he had practiced were 10 times more difficult than the Lv 1 Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist.Su Mo had been practicing Divine Wind Swordplay and Shadow Steps to the Minor Completion. The progression of his realm had been extremely slow. More than a month had passed, but the two martial arts techniques had only reached the peak of the Minor Completion.\"Hmm?\"Suddenly, Su Mo was aware of a problem. According to Luo Qianfan, it would still be very difficult for him to practice the Lv 3 martial arts techniques even if he took the Empty Spirit Fruits.He had never eaten an Empty Spirit Fruit, but the Lv 3 martial arts techniques he practiced had reached the peak of the Minor Completion.\"Is my comprehension excellent?\"Su Mo could not help thinking in his heart, but he immediately shook his head and no longer entangled in the problem. Anyway, his high comprehension was a good and harmless thing.\"How long will the effect of Empty Spirit Fruit last?\" Su Mo asked again.\"Each Empty Spirit Fruit can last an hour more or less, and you can take two at a time,\" Luo Qianfan answered.They walked and talked, and soon, they could see the light outside the cave.\"You go first!\"Su Mo suddenly stopped and said to Luo Qianfan.Glancing at Su Mo, Luo Qianfan felt confused, but without asking, he nodded and said, \"Be careful!\"Luo Qianfan went straight out of the cave.In the cave, Su Mo turned his head and looked back with a cold smile, and then he sat cross-legged on the ground.Anyone who wanted to go out must pay a price!Yes, Su Mo was ready to rob some Demonic Cores here.In the demon cave, there had been too many Demonic Insects, so he had not had a chance to plunder. But now he would not miss it, otherwise, it would be hard to rob them on such a large island.Although they were not weak and outnumbered, compared to Su Mo, they were not strong enough at this time.In addition, each of them had suffered serious injuries.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes were closed and he was sitting cross-legged.Before long, the sound of footsteps came from the demon cave.A burly figure rushed out quickly from the demon cave.The man was drenched in blood and had two huge bleeding wounds. He stopped suddenly when he was 10 steps away from Su Mo.He was one of the five geniuses, Cao Yuan.With the fastest speed, Cao Yuan was the first to get rid of the Demonic Insects and escape.\"Su Mo, I can't believe that you didn't escape!\"With his eyes bright, Cao Yuan was surprised. However, the next moment, he looked confused.Logically speaking, having grabbed so many Empty Spirit Fruits, Su Mo should have escaped as soon as possible instead of sitting here now.Thinking carefully, Cao Yuan did not attack at once, because even though Su Mo's cultivation was half a step to the Spiritual Martial Realm, he had easily blocked the attack from several people. He was at least as powerful as himself.Only a few people could block their joint shot after they gave a hurried shot and the attack power was not strong.Besides, now he could only give half of his force as he was seriously wounded. So, he might not defeat Su Mo.Cao Yuan was waiting for several people behind him. They could easily catch Su Mo if they did it together.\"Cao Yuan, leave your Demonic Cores before you go!\"Su Mo opened his eyes to take a glance at Cao Yuan.\"What?\"Stunned for a moment, Cao Yuan smiled in anger. \"Did I hear wrong? A trash of a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm actually wants to snatch my Demonic Cores? Ridiculous.\"Cao Yuan laughed as if he had just heard a joke.As one of the five geniuses in the new disciples of Gale Island and a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm, he was not afraid of Su Mo at all.\"What? Won't you?\"Su Mo smirked and smiled scornfully.\"Hmm! You want me to give up my Demonic Cores? Impossible!\"Cao Yuan sneered but immediately realized that if Su Mo snatched his Demonic Cores and left quickly, he would not be able to stop him. He was extremely wounded.But in order to hold Su Mo down and play for time, Cao Yuan said with a smile, \"However, I have a lot of Demonic Cores. If you want, I can sell some to you.\"\"Hand over your Demonic Cores in three breaths or you die!\" Su Mo said indifferently with a cold gaze.He stood up, wasting no time.\"You... Damn, you want my Demonic Cores? Show me your ability.\"Cao Yuan was furious. As a genius with a Rank 8 Human Class Martial Soul, he had never been despised like that. Without a word, he sliced Su Mo with his long saber.Suddenly, a 10-meter giant Sword Qi slashed toward Su Mo.Whoosh!There was a flash of white light, then the Sword Qi was split into two.Phew!The next moment, an icy cold light was pointing at Cao Yuan's throat.Gulp!Feeling the cold blade on his throat, Cao Yuan stood stiffly. He could not help swallowing.\"You still have one breath.\"Su Mo grinned. But that smile was terrifying in Cao Yuan's eyes.\"I'll hand... hand over my Demonic Cores!\"Cao Yuan hurriedly cried, with a pale face, and his eyes full of fear.Su Mo's strength was far beyond his expectation.He quickly handed his storage pouch over to Su Mo.\"F*ck off!\" Su Mo said coldly.He flipped the ridge of his sword to hit Cao Yuan's head. Cao Yuan staggered and almost fell down.\"Su Mo, you better watch out!\"Gnashing his teeth in anger, Cao Yuan hurriedly escaped with hate rising in his heart.Su Mo had not just taken his Demonic Cores away; he had even robbed him of his storage pouch.Watching Cao Yuan run off, Su Mo put the pouch into his storage ring. If Cao Yuan had directly handed him his Demonic Cores, Su Mo would not have taken his other items. However, he had not cooperated, so Su Mo robbed him blind.He looked into the demon cave as footsteps sounded again. It meant that someone was coming out.However, this time there was more than one person as the footsteps were noisy.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The next moment, a group of figures swept out from the demon cave.There were nine of them in total, including Wu Kui and Yan Qi and they all looked pale and flustered.When they saw Su Mo standing in front of them, the raging killing desire that had been surging in their hearts almost drowned him.They had been busy getting the Empty Spirit Fruits for a long time with many casualties, but they had not expected that Su Mo would get the final benefit. How could they not be angry?!\"Su Mo, hand over the Empty Spirit Fruits, or die!\" Yan Qi shouted.He rushed quickly towards Su Mo, his face full of killing desire.\"Su Mo, you can't get away!\"Wu Kui, Feng Zilan and the others arrived one after another and quickly besieged Su Mo.Su Mo blinked and smiled. \"Did I say I would flee?\"\"Su Mo, no more nonsense. I'm telling you clearly. You're going to die whether you hand over the Empty Spirit Fruits or not.\"With a cold expression and eyes full of cruelty, Wu Kui sneered. \"I'll tear your skin and tendons, and I'll torture you to death.\"\"Haha! Even tearing his skins and tendons would be showing mercy on him!\"Feng Zilan smiled. Her eyes had a vicious glint.It was difficult to imagine a woman could actually be so cruel.\"Guys? How do we allocate the Empty Spirit Fruits after killing him?\" a disciple of the Spiritual Martial Realm asked.\"He picked up a total of nine Empty Spirit Fruits, but he certainly gave some to Luo Qianfan. Only after killing him we'll know how many fruits he's left,\" Feng Zilan nodded and said.\"He may have four or five, and we...\" Yan Qi said, but then he was interrupted by Su Mo.Hearing their conversation, Su Mo laughed. Were they thinking that he was the fish on the chopping block? They had not even started fighting yet, but they were already discussing how to distribute the spoils!\"How could they be so confident!\"\"Are you done talking?\"Su Mo sneered and said, \"Don't you wonder why I am here waiting for you?\"\"Huh?\"They were all in a daze and felt puzzled.He was right! Why was he here waiting for them? Waiting to give them the Empty Spirit Fruits? Of course not!\"Hmm! Su Mo, why you stayed here.\"Yan Qi laughed disdainfully and proudly said, \"No matter what tricks you play, you can't escape today.\"Yan Qi was very confident. Although they were injured, they could fight with a martial artist at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm by jointly working with their full power, never mind Su Mo.\"Haha, because I'm waiting for you.\"Su Mo said with a smile, \"I'm waiting for you to give me your storage pouches.\"\"What?\"They were stunned and surprised by what Su Mo said. It appeared that he was going to snatch their storage pouches.They had a strange feeling.A martial artist half a step to the Spiritual Martial Realm was threatening to rob several martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm!Whoosh!Just then, Su Mo, who was smiling, suddenly launched an attack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mo suddenly popped up, and an unstoppable sharp sword radiance was rushing at Wu Kui like a strong wind. Unpredictably, it appeared before Wu Kui in a flash.\"Gale Blade!\"Su Mo swiftly launched an attack with the purpose of killing someone instantly.They jointly attacked him, which did not pose a real threat to him, but would put him into trouble.As long as he could kill one of them in the Spiritual Martial Realm, they would be in caution of him.Wu Kui was the most badly injured among them all.Moreover, Wu Kui desperately wanted to get rid of Su Mo and kept saying that he wanted to peel Su Mo's cramps.Therefore, Su Mo decided to attack Wu Kui with no hesitation.\"Puff!\"A head was tossed upward, and then blood was shot up into the sky.Wu Kui's head rolled down to the ground with his eyes wide open. Till the end, he had no idea how he died.\"What?\"The rest of the people were stunned when their faces were spattered with scarlet blood. Then, they all retreated in unison and kept their distance from Su Mo.None of them had thought that Su Mo would suddenly kill someone.\"Su Mo, you killed Wu Kui?\"Yan Qi was frightened and looked at Su Mo in disbelief.All of them felt afraid in their hearts for Su Mo appeared to be greatly powerful.Swish!After a flash, Su Mo stood in front of them and blocked them from leaving.\"Hand over all your storage pouches to me within 10 breaths, otherwise, you'll die as he did.\"Su Mo coldly glimpsed at them and indifferently said so.\"Why? Why should we give our storage pouches to you?\" A disciple of the Spiritual Martial Realm roared with a ferocious face.\"Puff!\"Replying to him, with a sharp Sword Qi flashing by, the disciple's head flew, same as Wu Kui.That disciple was also in the Spiritual Martial Realm, but he was heavily injured as well. Thus, he could not ward off the attack from Su Mo.\"No reason. You wanted to kill me, but I only want your storage pouches. In this case, I'm very merciful to all of you.\"Su Mo glanced at the rest of the seven people and coldly said, \"Three breaths have passed, you now have seven breaths left.\"\"You...\"The seven people were all furious and their eyes were flickering.Su Mo had killed two people in a second, which not only shocked them very much but also put a lot of pressure on their minds.Su Mo had killed two people with two strikes, showing that he was ridiculously powerful. Hence, he was more than a martial artist a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.Though Su Mo raided Wu Kui, he could not successfully kill Wu Kui without having enough ability. No one could succeed by only raiding.\"Yan Qi, if we jointly attack him, can we escape?\"Feng Zilan jiggled her lips and asked Yan Qi with the sound transmission technique.A martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm had the capability of transmitting their sounds within 100 steps.\"Hardly. He's probably experienced some adventures, so he's very powerful. What's more, even if we weren't injured, we couldn't defeat him.\" Yan Qi transmitted his words back.\"Then what should we do? Give our storage pouches to him? I'm unwilling to do that!\"Feng Zilan's face became pale and her eyes were full of indignation. She continued, \"Does he really dare to kill all of us?\"\"Hey! He's insane! No one knows what he will do!\"Yan Qi sighed and said after some thought, \"We'd better hand our storage pouches to him!\"\"Well...\" Feng Zilan hesitated in her mind.\"Relax. This is only for escaping. As long as we go back to Gale Island, we'll be at liberty to dispose of him.\"Yan Qi continued in a cold tone, \"My eldest brother is an Inner Disciple as well as a member of the Sky Alliance, so he'll easily handle Su Mo. By then, I'll make Su Mo pay a heavy price.\"Hearing this, Feng Zilan secretly sighed, \"Alright!\"On the scene, Su Mo saw all of them remain silent, and he sneered. \"Now the 10 breaths are gone, you're all so stubborn and silly. Then, don't blame me!\"Then, Su Mo gave full play to his breath and the longsword in his hand gave off a dazzling brilliance.\"Stop!\"Yan Qi shouted as he grit his teeth, \"I'm willing to give my storage pouch to you!\"After saying this, Yan Qi dejectedly passed his storage pouch to Su Mo.Then, Feng Zilan also handed her storage pouch over to Su Mo.After those two geniuses, the rest of the five people dejectedly followed suit.\"Haha!\"Su Mo was instantly overjoyed when he received their storage pouches.In fact, even if they were not willing to surrender their storage pouches, Su Mo did not dare to kill all of them.Basically speaking, these disciples were the most powerful ones among all of the new disciples. They were highly talented and valued by the Sect, especially those with Martial Souls of the Rank 8 Human Class. The Sect attached the most importance to them.He had killed Wu Kui. The Sect would be enraged by him if he killed Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, and other people. Consequently, he would receive severe punishment.Even though the trial test was open to killing, it was just right comparatively. If these new genius disciples were all killed, the Sect would be furious.After grabbing their storage pouches, Su Mo searched for the two storage pouches on the dead Wu Kui and the other disciple. After a loud laugh, he flew away, leaving Yan Qi and other people on the scene, livid and speechless.In a small cave, Su Mo sat cross-legged on the ground.Su Mo felt joyful upon seeing the trophies from these two days.In front of him, the storage pouches were lined up in good order.There were more than 20 storage pouches there. Over the two days, he had killed many people and all the storage pouches that he snatched were there.Holding a storage pouch, Su Mo opened it and its contents made his eyes brighten.This storage pouch had 32 Demonic Cores with a level higher than Class 7 Lv 1. Besides, 18,000 taels of gold and two Martial Scrolls were also included.\"Ho ho!\"Su Mo gently smiled and took out another storage pouch. He really looked forward to it as he opened it.It was the storage pouch which belonged to Wu Kui and it was considered valuable.Crash!As it was opened, a pile of things was poured out.Su Mo's eyes were frozen. There were nearly 200 Demonic Cores, over 80,000 taels of gold tickets, five Martial Scrolls, and seven Spiritual Herbs, as well as 20 Lower Spiritual Stones.Among the seven Spiritual Herbs, five were Spiritual Herbs of Upper Lv 1, while the remaining two were at Lower Lv 2.\"Ha ha!\"Su Mo was exhilarated and thought, \"This is huge wealth!\" Unexpectedly, Wu Kui was so opulent that he even owned 20 Spiritual Stones.Immediately, Su Mo impatiently opened all of the storage pouches and he felt shocked by the total wealth.Over 20 storage pouches had 1,130 Demonic Cores, 450,000 taels of gold tickets, 42 Martial Scrolls, 16 weapons, and 43 Spiritual Herbs.Those people who were robbed by Su Mo all were outstanding among the new disciples. None was weak and each one was born into a wealthy family.Especially Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, and other Spiritual Martial Realm disciples. Each one's storage pouch was as valuable as Wu Kui's.\"Are there also Soul Crystals?\"Su Mo found five Soul Crystals among all the things. Judging by their fluctuating souls, he could tell that they were all Soul Crystals of Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Souls.Soul Crystals were of little importance to regular martial artists, so few of them would purchase.As far as Su Mo was concerned, only Pill-refining Masters or Tool-forging Masters would buy plenty of Soul Crystals.Seeing the Soul Crystals, Su Mo could not help sighing secretly.In this trial test, Su Mo grabbed countless valuable items. Unfortunately, after devouring so many Beast Souls and Martial Souls, his Devouring Martial Spirit had still not progressed.He felt anxious again. If his Devouring Martial Spirit could not progress, it would remain a great blow to his martial arts road in future.His Martial Soul stood at a medium ranking among the Outer Gate, let alone the entire Gale Island.Sighing again, Su Mo shook his head, then crushed five Soul Crystals. He let out his Martial Soul to swallow the five Beast Souls.Buzz!Right at that moment, after keeping silent for a long time, his Devouring Martial Soul instantly shook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mo was feeling depressed because his Martial Soul had not progressed for a long time.He carelessly swallowed five Beast Souls, and he never anticipated improving his Martial Soul in this way.However, an unintentionally positive outcome appeared. At this moment, his Devouring Martial Spirit was shaking.The seventh yellow halo suddenly appeared next to the sixth.Su Mo's eyes widened instantly in surprise. Finally, his Devouring Martial Spirit progressed.His Martial Soul was promoted from Rank 6 Human Class to Rank 7 Human Class.\"Huff!\"He slowly let out a mouthful of heavy air and no longer felt depressed.\"I seemed over-worried. My Martial Soul could still progress, and I just need more Beast Souls or Martial Souls!\"Su Mo smiled again.As long as his Martial Soul could progress, no matter how many Beast Souls or Martial Souls he needed, he would manage ways to get them.He had obtained tremendous wealth in this trial test so it was no problem for him to buy a large number of Beast Souls.Su Mo put all trophies into the storage ring while putting Demonic Cores into a storage pouch.After going back to Gale Island, he would sort them out. He would hand over those unuseful things to the sect so as to exchange for some contribution points.Then, he would use contribution points to exchange countless Beast Souls.Thus, his Martial Soul would be promoted soon.Immediately, Su Mo sat cross-legged in the small cave and was ready to cultivate in order to consolidate his cultivation.He had grabbed more than 1,100 Demonic Cores. In addition to his own, the Demonic Cores totaled nearly 1,300. In this case, he did not need to hunt Demonic Cores.He would certainly be the champion in this Qingyuan Trial Test.How time flew!The next day, nearly at noon, a loud shout sounded above the island, instantly waking Su Mo up.\"The trial test is over and all disciples must come back within four hours.\"The shout spread over the entire island. It was said by Elder Wei.Hearing this, Su Mo stood up, stepped out of the cave, and flew towards the edge of the woods.Meanwhile, hundreds of new disciples on the island fleeted through the woods and went back....Outside the woods on Qingyuan Island, many people had gathered, including dozens of outer elders and a few new disciples.These new disciples had given up the trial test so they had left the woods early.Some disciples had to give up the test because of their severe injuries, such as Li Feng.Some disciples were knocked out early because they were very weak and could not block forceful demonic beasts so they had to ask the elders for help.\"Elders, can you guess who can be the champion of this Qingyuan Trial Test?\"The elders stood together, and a square-faced elder in his middle age asked with a smile.\"The champion must be one of the eight disciples at the Spiritual Martial Realm!\" Another elder in a blue robe asserted.The square-faced elder rolled his eyes at his words and sneered, \"Elder Zhao, you're saying nonsense. Even a three-year-old child knows that the champion must be a Spiritual Martial Realm disciple.\"\"Humf! You tell me who will be the champion!\"The elder in blue robe huffed coldly.\"In my view, the champion must be one of the five disciples with Martial Soul of Rank 8 Human Class, but I'm not sure who it is.\"The square-faced elder smiled.\"Humf! I do not agree with you. Disciples with higher Martial Soul definitely have stronger combat strength than those with lower ones. But the trial test isn't a pure competition. Those powerful disciples will not likely obtain the most Demonic Cores.\"The elder in blue robe sneered back.\"Elder Zhao is right! Since they are all in the Spiritual Martial Realm and almost have the same cultivation, it's hard to judge.\"Other elders nodded their heads in unison.\"Elder Wei, in your eyes, who will be most likely to become champion?\"The square-faced elder turned his head around and respectfully asked Elder Wei.After some thoughts, Elder Wei fixed his eyes on the deep woods and said, \"I think it's Luo Qianfan.\"\"Oh, why does Elder Wei say so?\" All elders asked.\"Among the eight Spiritual Martial Realm disciples, the five geniuses are the most likely to be the champion. Since they have the same force, it's really hard to tell.\"Elder Wei nodded, then continued, \"When it comes to the possibility, it must be Luo Qianfan.\"The long-distance attack of his bow and arrow is terrifying. He can quickly kill demonic beasts. In such a case, he overruns other professional martial artists.\"Luo Qianfan, however, is just the most likely one. The final rankings can only be known after the result of the trial test,\" Elder Wei slowly said.\"Elder Wei, you're right!\"Hearing what Elder Wei said, they all nodded and agreed with him.An archer was probably not good at close combat, but a powerful archer was the King of Distant Fight. He could launch a long-distance attack to smash all other attacks.More than 30 elders of Gale Island once attempted to kill an enemy who was an archer.However, the result shamed those elders down to the ground.They were overwhelmingly capable of killing him, but these elders could not even approach him.With 50,000 meters away from them, his arrows did not miss, throwing the elders into a shame. Under such circumstances, they could not take a step forward.Although the elders were all good at close combat, their attack force faded away at 5,000 meters, let alone 50,000 meters. If they were more than 25,000 meters from an enemy, they were totally vulnerable.In the end, it was Gale Island owner who killed this man.The elders were chatting. As time went by, the disciples continuously went back.Half of the disciples had returned within two hours.Whoosh!After a two-hour-journey, Su Mo rushed out of the woods like a cheetah.Nobody paid attention to him.Standing at the edge of the woods, Su Mo looked around and found that Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, Luo Qianfan, and the others had not yet returned.Su Mo saw Li Feng healing himself on a huge stone, and he walked towards him.\"Li Feng, how's your wound?\" asked Su Mo when approaching Li Feng.Li Feng opened his eyes and smiled, \"I'm fine. My wounds are stabilized. I'll reach full recovery in nearly a month.\"\"Su Mo, I'm glad that you came back. Honestly speaking, I was worried about you gunning for Huang Yunqing.\"Li Feng shook his head and felt relieved in his heart.If Su Mo was killed gunning for Huang Yunqing to avenge for him, he would blame himself.\"Huang Yunqing has already died!\" Su Mo said with a smile.\"What? Huang Yunqing is dead?\"Li Feng was in a daze and felt puzzled.\"I didn't kill him, but I witnessed that he was killed by a demonic beast,\" Su Mo said.It was true that Huang Yunqing was not killed by him, but by a black Demonic Insect.\"Killed by a demonic beast?\"Li Feng felt relieved and then nodded his head. As far as he was concerned, Su Mo was unable to kill Huang Yunqing, but it was quite normal for Huang Yunqing to be bitten to death by a demonic beast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Niu Xiaohu was not powerful, he was worried that something terrible happened to him.Just at that moment, a sturdy figure rushed out of the woods, and it was Niu Xiaohu himself.Exhausted as Niu Xiaohu was, his eyes brightened with excitement.\"Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm!\"Su Mo was surprised. He could sense a strong fluctuating breath inside Niu Xiaohu's body. This fluctuating breath caused the air surrounding him to flow, which indicated that he had just broken through his realm and could not control himself well.\"Senior Su Mo and Li Feng, I'm back!\"Niu Xiaohu approached them with a smile.\"Well done, Xiaohu! You've broken through your cultivation over just three days.\" Su Mo gently smile.\"Haha! I happened to obtain a Spiritual Herb on my way back; thus, I've broken through my cultivation!\"Niu Xiaohu revealed an innocent smile, looked at the pale Li Feng, and then said in surprise, \"Senior Li Feng, you're... you're injured!\"\"Haha! I'm fine! It's just a scratch.\"Li Feng brightly smiled and did not want to lose face in front of Niu Xiaohu.\"That's good!\"Niu Xiaohu nodded his head.When they talked with each other, most of the disciples had gradually returned.Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, and the other disciples returned together. They fixed their eyes on Su Mo in unison the minute they got out of the woods. Each of them wore a darkened face and gritted their teeth as if they desperately wanted to eat Su Mo alive.The rest of the disciples' expressions were unintelligible.\"Senior Su Mo, Li Feng, Yan Qi, and the other people seem to have been staring at me just now!\"Standing beside Su Mo, Niu Xiaohu scratched his head with a confused look. He said in confusion, \"Judging from their expressions, they seem to have a grudge against me. But I've never offended them!\"\"Haha! Xiaohu, you must see it's a mistake. Ignore them!\" Su Mo said with a gentle smile.The person who Yan Qi and the others hated was him, not Niu Xiaohu.Li Feng arched his eyebrows for he had felt the strong killing desire in their eyes.Having glanced at Su Mo, Li Feng fell into thoughts.After nearly one hour, all the disciples had returned.\"Elder Wang, how many disciples have returned?\"Having looked around, Elder Wei asked the elder in the blue robe beside him.\"Elder Wei, 500 disciples have attended the trial test, 447 of whom have returned. However, 53 disciples haven't shown up.\"The elder in the blue robe used his Spiritual Thought to count all the disciples present and then respectfully replied.\"As in previous years, 10% of the disciples are dead.\"Elder Wei nodded his head with an indifferent expression. He did not show any mercy for the dead disciples.Gale Island needed elites so it would not be pitiful if mediocre disciples were killed.Moreover, being killed in such a simple trial test would only show these disciples' incapabilities.\"Fine! Since time's up, let's go back to Gale Island!\"Elder Wei said again and was about to make an announcement.\"Elder Wei, Wu Kui hasn't returned yet, neither have the two disciples of the Spiritual Martial Realm,\" the square-faced elder suddenly said in confusion.\"Really?\"Hearing this, Elder Wei inspected all the disciples present and did not find Wu Kui or the other two. His brows instantly furrowed.\"Since they're powerful, they wouldn't be killed in Qingyuan Island. In thirty minutes, we'll go back if they still haven't returned,\" Elder Wei said after some thoughts.Elder Wei would never make such a decision for the regular disciples. Moreover, the regular disciples were also not qualified to make elders wait for them.However, Wu Kui was different. He had a Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class, so he would certainly enter the inner gate, even probably become a core disciple.Wu Kui with a Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class would at least become an outer elder in the future.Therefore, Elder Wei attached more importance to him.Time flew by, and 30 minutes passed.\"Elder Liu and Elder Zhao, you go to the island and search for them. I'll take the rest to the sect.\"After giving this order, Elder Wei turned around and announced. \"Now then, all the disciples gather up, board the ship, and return to Gale Island.\"All the disciples boarded the ship again and backtracked at his order.It was almost dusk when they returned to Gale Island. Once again, they gathered together on the square.On the square was a wooden desk, 10 meters long and five meters wide. A dozen elders were seated behind the desk.\"Well! Now, whoever thinks that he'll have a good ranking, you can step forward and pour out your Demonic Cores!\"Elder Wei was seated in the middle of them and loudly shouted.At that moment, Elder Wei continuously looked at the disciples present, his brightened eyes full of mixed feelings.Elder Zhao and Elder Liu had already returned.They soon discovered Wu Kui. Because they were powerful and could fly in the air, they had returned to the sect earlier than the disciples who took the ship.Wu Kui was found dead with his head decapitated.They had found the bodies of Wu Kui and another Spiritual Martial Realm disciple on the way to the demon cave.They had also found many corpses inside the cave but Demonic Insects had gnawed the corpses into bones.The corpses inside the cave were probably bitten to death by Demonic Insects, but Wu Kui and another disciple were apparently killed in one strike by a person.Elder Wei wondered who could be capable of killing them.\"Is it Luo Qianfan?\"\"Or Yan Qi? Cao Yuan?\"\"Or anyone else?\"Elder Wei was not enraged by Wu Kui's death. Instead, he was greatly curious to know who killed them.Now that the person was able to kill two Spiritual Martial Realm geniuses, he must be more powerful than them.Since he was that powerful, his trial test ranking must be in the front row. By then, he would naturally reveal his identity.Elder Wei had expectations in his heart.Hearing what Elder Wei said, the new disciples stepped forward one by one and took out their own Demonic Cores.The elders would score them by the levels and number of their Demonic Cores.Speaking of the numbers, some had dozens of Demonic Cores while some had only several Demonic Cores.A Demonic Core of Class 7 Lv 1 was counted as one point, a Class 8 Lv 1 as two points, one Class 9 Lv 1 as four points, and a Demonic Core of Class 1 Lv 2 as eight points.Soon, more than 200 disciples had been scored.At that time, Cao Yuan, one of the five geniuses, stepped forward. After he waved his sleeve, a pile of Demonic Cores appeared on the desk.\"Geeze! Senior Cao Yuan has obtained so many Demonic Cores!\"\"Great! With so many Demonic Cores, Senior Cao Yuan would probably be the champion.\"\"I doubt it. Other disciples of the Spiritual Martial Realm must also have many Demonic Cores.\"As soon as Cao Yuan took out the Demonic Cores, the crowd instantly exclaimed and then burst into a discussion.Nearly 300 Demonic Cores were piled in front of Cao Yuan.Standing in the crowd, Su Mo felt surprised. He had plundered all of Cao Yuan's Demonic Cores yesterday, but within one day, Cao Yuan had obtained so many more.Unknown to Su Mo, after exiting the demon cave, Cao Yuan drove his followers to loot Demonic Cores for him so he could acquire many Demonic Cores in one day.The elders soon counted Cao Yuan's Demonic Cores. Cao Yuan then put them away and strode off.Confronted with others' surprising and admiring expressions, Cao Yuan felt bitter instead of proud in his heart.As far as he was concerned, he would absolutely miss the championship even if he had nearly 300 Demonic Cores.Turning his head around and looking at Su Mo, Cao Yuan felt resentful in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she didn't have as many Demonic Cores as Cao Yuan, she still had more than 200.Soon, it was Yan Qi's turn. He walked to the table and waved his hand. A light shone, and a sound burst, and several Demonic Cores were poured out. It was more than 500, far more than Cao Yuan's.\"Geeze! I can't believe Senior Yan Qi has actually obtained so many Demonic Cores!\"\"Great, way more than Senior Cao Yuan.\"\"Haha, Senior Yan Qi will win first place.\"All the disciples were shocked.There was a twinkle in Elder Wei's eyes and he looked Yan Qi up and down.\"Did he kill Wu Kui?\"If Yan Qi had killed Wu Kui, it would be fair and reasonable, because Yan Qi's Martial Soul was not any worse than Wu Kui's. It was not surprising that Yan Qi was able to kill him.Yan Qi glanced proudly at Su Mo in the distance with a trace of mockery.He had more than one storage pouch. Although Su Mo had robbed him of one, he still had others. With the addition of the Demonic Cores disciples had given him, it was a great amount.He still had the opportunity to win this trial.Many disciples came forward to count their Demonic Cores. Among all the newly-recruited disciples, only a few people had obtained more than a hundred Demonic Cores, except for the disciples of the Spiritual Martial Realm.So far Yan Qi was the disciple with the most Demonic Cores.Niu Xiaohu had collected a total of 42 Demonic Cores.\"Senior Su Mo, how many Demonic Cores do you have?\" Niu Xiaohu asked after he had counted his Demonic Cores.\"Haha, more than you!\" Su Mo smiled.\"Heh heh, you are stronger than me, of course, you have more than me. Maybe you will be fortunate enough to get into the top 20!\"Niu Xiaohu laughed.\"Fortunate?\"Su Mo shrugged his shoulders and laughed with confidence. \"I'm sure I will be 'fortunate' enough to get into the top 20.\"\"Ah! If Senior Li Feng hadn't given up the trial for injury, he would also have a chance!\"Niu Xiaohu sighed and looked at Li Feng, who stood beside him depressed.Li Feng made a forced laugh and tried to save face, saying, \"Xiaohu, it was just a trial. It's not worth mentioning. Someday I will regain my glory!\"\"Of course, I believe in you, Senior Li Feng!\"Niu Xiaohu said seriously, but then he yelled, \"Look, it's Luo Qianfan! He actually has at least as many Demonic Cores as Yan Qi.\"When he looked forward, Su Mo saw Luo Qianfan standing at the table. In front of him was a stack of Demonic Cores. It was not less than Yan Qi.Su Mo nodded slightly. Luo Qianfan's abilities were powerful, so it was no surprise that he could get over 500 Demonic Cores.\"Luo Qianfan deserves to be one of the five geniuses. He has more than 500 Demonic Cores.\"\"It seems the winner of the Qingyuan trial will be either Yan Qi or Luo Qianfan. It just depends on whose score is higher.\"\"Well, among the five geniuses, Feng Zilan and Cao Yuan can not possibly come in first place. Hey, where's Wu Kui?\"Everyone was discussing it animatedly. Some of them had just noticed that Wu Kui had not come back.\"Damn, Wu Kui really didn't come back. Did he die?\"\"How can this be possible? Who could kill him? Unless he encountered a very powerful Demonic Beast.\"\"Humph! Did you not notice? Not only Wu Kui, the martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm, but Huang Yunqing and Song Liang did not come back either.\"Everyone was shocked and in an uproar the next moment.A small number of the disciples had already known that Wu Kui had probably died, the disciples who had stayed outside the demon cave and refuged with him.They had witnessed Wu Kui go into the demon cave, but he never came out.However, most of the disciples did not know this completely, so when they found that Wu Kui had not come back, they were shocked.\"Quiet!\"Elder Wei shouted to calm the audiences, and they quieted down at once.Then, they continued to count Demonic Cores.Soon, most of the disciples had counted their Demonic Cores.At this point, in the audiences' view, the first rankings were clear.Yan Qi and Luo Qianfan would come in first place and second place respectively, Cao Yuan would be third, and Feng Zilan would be fourth.Elder Wei knew that Wu Kui must have been killed by one of the four geniuses. As for who killed him, it was not clear, but it was probably Yan Qi or Luo Qianfan.The person had been able to kill two same-level experts at the same time, and what was more, cut their heads with one attack. This meant that he was extremely powerful. Thus, his talent was definitely the best among the newly-recruited disciples, perhaps, the sect should focus on training him.When other people's Demonic Cores had finally been counted, Su Mo walked over slowly.Su Mo had not intended to be the last one. However, he knew he had won so he was not in a hurry.\"Take out your Demonic Cores quickly!\"In front of the table sat an elder who was in charge of inventory. He was Elder Wang and wore a green robe. He did not even raise his eyes as he said this.Su Mo was the last one, and once he counted Su Mo's Demonic Cores, his task would be over.Su Mo nodded. He took out a storage pouch and opened it.Suddenly, a crashing voice sounded, and an endless heap of Demonic Cores poured out.Soon, the amount of Demonic Cores Su Mo poured out was more than 300.\"What?!\"Elder Wang was surprised. He had not expected that this unknown disciple in front of him had hunted more than 300 Demonic Cores. He had caught up with Cao Yuan.However, the next moment, Elder Wang's expression turned from surprise to shock, because the Demonic Cores continued to pour out from Su Mo's storage pouch.Crash!Soon, the number had gotten close to 500.\"Wow, am I dazzled!? How can he have so many Demonic Cores?\"\"Damn, who is he? How can that be possible?\"\"Is he also a martial artist of the Spiritual Martial Realm? Did he hide his cultivation before?\"The surrounding disciples were even more shocked than Elder Wang.Clang! Clang! Clang !The Demonic Cores kept falling from Su Mo's storage pouch as if they were endless.600!700!800!900!1000!When the number of the Demonic Cores was about 1000, Su Mo took back his storage pouch.1000 Demonic Cores stacked like a hill. They filled the entire desktop.The light was shining and the demonic Qi was wafting.Elder Wang was dumbfounded!All the disciples were shocked.Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu gawped with their eyes wide. Their opened mouths were wide enough to stuff a duck's egg.Everyone was silent!Completely silent!Elder Wei was the first to awaken himself. There was a bright light flashing in his eyes, and he stared closely at Su Mo.He was now certain that the man who had killed Wu Kui was not Luo Qianfan, nor Yan Qi, but the young man standing in front of him.Elder Wei's cultivation was rather high, so he could easily judge that Su Mo's cultivation was still half a step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.But he still believed that he was the killer.Moreover, after using his Spiritual Thought to carefully observe, he found that Su Mo's body constitution was different from ordinary people, and his Qi blood was very strong, dozens of times that of a normal person. He was like a humanoid fierce beast.Elder Wei was overjoyed. \"Does he have special body constitutions?\"He had already made his decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 Contribution Points ReceivedSu Mo was standing there with 1,000 Demonic Cores in front of him, making the crowd confused.Elder Wang was so shocked to see the piled up Demonic Cores in front of him that he actually forgot to count.\"Elder?\"Su Mo softly called him out as he noticed that Elder Wang had not moved for a while.In fact, Su Mo had only wanted to take out around 800 Demonic Cores without being in the limelight.However, considering the score of Demonic Cores, he took more to ensure the first place as there was a huge difference in each level of Demonic Cores.If the average level of Demonic Cores was low, his score would likely not be the highest.For example, the score of a Class 1 Lv 2 Demonic Core was double that of a Class 9 Lv 1 Demonic Core. And it was also eight times higher than that of a Class 7 Lv 1 Demonic Core.So, the 1,000 Demonic Cores should be enough.\"Oh!\" Elder Wang was brought back to reality. He quickly started to mark the inventory registration with a surprised look.Yan Qi, Cao Yuan, Feng Zilan and the others looked terrified as well.Although they had expected Su Mo to have a lot of Demonic Cores, 1,000 Cores still stunned them.In addition, they were filled with resentment and humiliation as most of the Demonic Cores belonged to them!Now, they were simply being used for Su Mo's benefit.\"Oh my god! 1,000 Demonic Cores!\"\"It's impossible! How did he get so many Demonic Cores?\"\"Cheating! He's probably cheating!\"\"Yeah, he must be cheating! It's totally impossible to get so many Demonic Cores!\"The disciples were all incredibly shocked. They were all shaking their heads and a lot of them started to make noise about it.\"Elder, he's cheating!\"\"Yeah, elder. It's impossible for him to get so many Demonic Cores without cheating!\"\"We suggest he be disqualified.\"Many of the disciples suggested the elder disqualify Su Mo.Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, and the other disciples agreed one by one. They were looking at Su Mo with a sneer.If Su Mo was disqualified, their rankings would be moved forward. Their hatred towards him could also be temporarily resolved.\"Quiet!\"Elder Wei rose and his majestic coercion enveloped everyone. The crowd instantly quieted down.\"I've looked at these Demonic Cores. They really have been hunted on Qingyuan Island within the last three days.\"Elder Wei looked serious. Loudly and solemnly, he said, \"There will be no further discussion on this matter. Any offender will be charged with disrupting the sect.\"The crowd suddenly retracted, and no one dared to speak further.Offending an elder was a suicidal act.The inventory check was carried out very quickly and completed within a minute. After that, Su Mo took the Demonic Cores and left.The Demonic Cores hunted on Qingyuan Island would not be possessed by the sect. The disciple was free to take them back after the inventory check.Once the Demonic Cores were checked and registered, everyone gathered in the square to wait for the elder to announce the result.\"Brother Su Mo, am I having double-vision? Have you really obtained 1,000 Demonic Cores?!\"Niu Xiaohu, who was standing beside Su Mo, looked shocked.Similarly, Li Feng looked unfocused with a gaze of disbelief.How was it possible to obtain 1,000 Demonic Cores within three days? Even if he had been hunting non-stop for the beasts?It was impossible to even kill 1,000 pigs on Qingyuan Island within three days.\"Hehe! Xiaohu, nothing is impossible in this world. Nothing is unachievable, only unexpected!\" Su Mo said unpredictably with a smile.It did not take long for the score ranking to finish.Elder Wei softly coughed and rose to make his announcement loudly. \"The trial of new disciples has successfully concluded. Now, I'm going to announce the first 20 places of the trial.\"Everyone was quietly listening in a pin-drop silence.\"20th place: Du Cheng, with a score of 260 points!\"\"19th place: Ma Yue, with a score of 272 points!\"\"18th place: Zhang Qiwen, with a score of 285 points!\"\"...\"\"11th place: Liu Ying, with a score of 408 points!\"Elder Wei announced the scores of 20th to 11th place in a breath and the disciples whose names were called were all seized with joy.Although their rankings were not high, it was a great glory to stand out among the 500 newly disciples.Besides, the reward for 11th to 20th place was extremely generous. Each of them would receive 30 contribution points.Other disciples who hoped to be ranked were nervously holding their breath at this time.Elder Wei continued to announce after pausing for a while.\"10th place: Zhang Nan, With a score of 410 points!\"\"...\"\"Fifth place: Feng Zilan, with a score of 693 points!\"\"Fourth place: Cao Yuan, with a score of 864 points!\"Cao Yuan and Feng Zilan were not surprised when they heard their rankings. They had pretty much known what to expect and that it was basically impossible for them to enter top three.Yan Qi looked dignified. He was nervous. His Demonic Core quantity was pretty close to Luo Qianfan's and it was the critical moment of announcing their scores.He was no longer hoping to be in the first place.\"Third place: Yan Qi, with a score of 1,504 points!\"Yan Qi's gaze was frozen, and he frowned when Elder Wei announced his score. He had actually come in third place, losing to Luo Qianfan.\"Second place: Luo Qianfan, with a score of 1,505 points!\"Elder Wei paused again at this time.The crowd was surprised and looked at Yan Qi with pity.Yan Qi suddenly looked livid. He had actually lost to Luo Qianfan by one point only and missed the second place.Although it was only one spot away from third to second place, the reward difference was doubled.The reward for third place was 100 contribution points, while the reward for second place was 200 contribution points.Yan Qi had missed the opportunity to obtain 200 contribution points with a difference of just one point.How could he be in a good mood!\"I now announce the first place winner of this Qingyuan Trial Test. He's also 'The Rookie King' among the new disciples of this time. And the winner is...\"Elder Wei looked at Su Mo with a smile and loudly said, \"First place: Su Mo, with a score of 3,020 points!\"Elder Wei's voice lingered in the square.It was so quiet that even the sound of a pin dropping could be heard.The score of 3,020 points was even more than the total score of second and third place combined.It was both a surprise to the crowd, yet at the same time, within their expectation.The results had been set when Su Mo showed up with 1,000 Demonic Cores.It was still hard to convince the crowd that this unknown disciple had beaten everyone and won the competition.However, no one dared to discuss it further, no matter how unhappy they were, as Elder Wei had confirmed that he was not cheating.\"Will the 20 disciples quickly come forward with your jade identification badges to receive the reward.\"Su Mo and the others came forward together with their personal jade identification badges.\"The 20 of you have stood out in this trial, which proves not only your talent but also your true talent. I hope you'll continue to work hard and become the pillars of Gale Island in the future.\"Elder Wei looked at the crowd and said with encouragement.Most of his gaze concentrated on Su Mo and he was silently nodding to himself.Su Mo was calm with not a trace of arrogance nor impetuosity even though he had won. He was indeed a promising talent.Elder Wei flexed his fingers. 20 light rays suddenly ejected from his hand and flashed into their jade identification badges like lightning.Su Mo was moved. A wisp of genuine Qi was injected into his jade identification badge.A few lines of small print then appeared on the jade badge.Name: Su MoIdentity: Outer DiscipleContribution points: 300 points.Su Mo instantly felt a great joy when he saw the message on his jade identification badge.He had received 300 contribution points.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He gained four Empty Spirit Fruits, 300 contribution points, as well as plenty of spoils, which made him become wealthy.Now, Su Mo would sort them out carefully, keeping the useful things and exchanging the rest for contribution points.In this trial, Su Mo got 1,130 Demonic Cores, 480,000 gold tickets, 42 Martial Scrolls, 16 weapons, 43 Spiritual Herbs, and 32 elixirs in total.Su Mo kept 80,000 gold tickets, which were enough to spend, and contributed the remaining 400,000 gold tickets to the Sect.Su Mo checked all of the 42 Martial Scrolls, of which most were Upper Lv 1. There were only 11 Lv 2 Martial Scrolls, which were Lower Grade, that Su Mo did not need.However, Su Mo thought he had too few martial arts techniques, so he decided to exchange for a martial arts technique of a higher level from the Sect.There were 16 weapons, of which eight were swords, and Su Mo selected a long silver sword.This was a sword of Lower Lv 2. The blade was as bright as snow with a cold and fierce light. The handle of the sword was inlaid with a blue gemstone that was quite dazzling.The sword that Su Mo used before was a refined sword of Upper Lv 1, which was brought from the clan, but not a match on this long sword with a gemstone.As for his Spirit-slayer Sword, it was a sword of Lower Lv 3, which was a weapon that only martial artists in the True Spirit Realm could use. In general, he would not show it.As for the 43 Spiritual Herbs, Su Mo only kept 10 Spiritual Herbs of Lower Lv 2 and decided to contribute the others to the Sect.Most elixirs he got were for healing and Genuine Qi recovery of a low level, of which Su Mo kept only a few bottles.\"What's this?\"At this time, Su Mo suddenly found a parchment the size of a hand among the packs of trophies.Taking the parchment, Su Mo checked it carefully and found that it was a map.But it seemed that the map was incomplete, so obviously, it was only one part of a whole map.It was just an incomplete one.Shaking his head, Su Mo randomly put the incomplete map into the storage ring.After arranging all the trophies, Su Mo began to cultivate. He tried hard to consolidate the cultivation and refine the Genuine Qi.On the broad mountain road in Gale Island, people came and went.Su Mo walked on the mountain road towards the contribution palace of the Sect.There were large numbers of people on Gale Island. The entire Sect covered several mountains with the strongest Spiritual Qi.There was the medicine palace, the martial arts palace, the contribution palace, the sect affair palace, the mission palace, and Purple Gold Hall in Gale Island.It was divided into different classes, and each performed its own duties, which was very detailed.Now, Su Mo was on the road to the contribution palace.After arriving at the hall of the contribution palace, Su Mo picked out all the weapons, Spiritual Herbs, Demonic Cores, and scrolls that were arranged the previous night.He exchanged all of them for contribution points.After the calculation, all of the goods were worth 1,125 contribution points.Even Su Mo was quite surprised by such a high value.The trophies of this time were times more than the award of winning the first place.So, killing people and snatching treasures was the easiest way to make people rich.After he finished exchanging contribution points, Su Mo walked to Purple Gold Hall.Purple Gold Hall was a place that took charge of resources in Gale Island. Except for Martial Scrolls, all cultivating resources could be found in the Purple Gold Hall.The Purple Gold Pavilion of each city in Skymoon Country was operated by Purple Gold Hall, which earned resources and money for Gale Island.\"Elder, I want to exchange some Beast Souls.\"Su Mo came to the hall of Purple Gold Hall and spoke to the elder garrisoning there.\"Oh, what level of Beast Soul do you want to exchange, and how many?\" the elder of Purple Gold Hall asked.Su Mo thought and then asked, \"I want to exchange Beast Souls of Class 3 Lv 2. What's the price?\"The power of Beast Souls at Class 1 Lv 2 was too low to make any effect on Su Mo's Martial Soul progression.If he continued to devour Beast Souls of Class 1 Lv 2, he did not know how many that he would need for the progression of his Martial Soul.Even the Beast Souls of Class 2 Lv 2 did not bring definite improvements.Therefore, Su Mo decided to buy Beast Souls of Class 3 Lv 2, which was two classes higher.Though the Beast Souls of Class 3 Lv 2 were expensive, the effect was much better and the power was at least 10 times stronger than the Beast Souls of Class 1 Lv 2.\"10 contribution points for a Beast Soul Crystal of Class 3 Lv 2,\" the elder of Purple Gold Hall said.\"10 contribution points for each? So expensive!\"Su Mo was startled. He thought that one Beast Soul Crystal of Class 3 Lv 2 might cost five or six contribution points. Unexpectedly, it cost 10 contribution points for each.The price was five times more expensive than a Beast Soul of Class 1 Lv 2.\"All the prices of the goods in Purple Gold Hall are 10% cheaper for our disciples. The prices are higher outside of the island.\"The elder of Purple Gold Hall laughed. Finding that Su Mo only had a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm cultivation, he disdainfully said, \"You can leave if you can't afford it! And come back when you earn enough contribution points.\"Su Mo did not care about the contempt from the elder of Purple Gold Hall. He thought and then said, \"Exchange 100 Beast Soul Crystals of Class 3 Lv 2 for me.\"Su Mo decided to make an exchange in the end. Although the price was a little bit expensive, it was still within his budget.\"100 crystals! Do you have enough contribution points?\"The elder was stunned with suspicion.100 Beast Soul Crystals of Class 3 Lv 2 required 1,000 contribution points. It was normally only Inner Disciples or some powerful Outer Disciples who owned so many contribution points.However, Su Mo was just a disciple who was in a half step away from the Spiritual Martial Realm. The elder did not believe that Su Mo could have such a number of contribution points.\"Of course!\"Su Mo nodded his head and took out his jade identification badge.The Purple Gold Pavilion elder received it and put Genuine Qi into it, and then Su Mo's information immediately emerged.1,425 points.Su Mo had exchanged his trophies for 1,125 points of contribution\u2014plus the awards of the test, it was exactly 1,425.The elder nodded his head and confirmed that Su Mo's contribution points were enough, so he took out 100 Beast Souls of Class 3 Lv 2.Then the elder lightly wiped Su Mo's jade identification badge. A white swirl flashed, and then the jade identification badge recovered as usual.Su Mo took back his jade identification badge and checked it, finding that his contribution points were reduced by 1,000 points with 425 points remaining.\"Which do you want to learn, refining pills or refining magic tools?\" the elder asked Su Mo finally.Beast Souls were used for refining pills and refining magic tools, which other disciples rarely used, so the elder asked him.\"Both,\" Su Mo smiled and answered equivocally.Then, Su Mo walked out of Purple Gold Hall and went to the martial arts palace.The martial arts palace was the place to deposit the Martial Scrolls of Gale Island.The martial arts palace was a huge palace with five floors, in which the number of cultivation methods and martial arts techniques were countless.Su Mo took 50 contribution points to exchange for a Medium Lv 2 Martial Skill, Nine Rapier Movements of the Wind Devil.Nine Rapier Movements of the Wind Devil was very strong. According to the scroll recording, this swordplay was absolutely the best among the martial arts techniques in the same level.Su Mo could not help sighing. \"Awesome! With my contribution points, I can exchange for everything I want.\"Back to his living courtyard, Su Mo found a youth in black standing there.Su Mo noticed that the youth was just the young elder, Wang Hui.\"Elder Wang,\" Su Mo hurried over to him and said with respect.\"Su Mo, Elder Wei wants to see you,\" said Wang Hui with a smile on his cold face after seeing Su Mo.\"Elder Wei?\"Su Mo frowned and wondered.It was unexpected that an elder, Elder Wei, wanted to see him and had sent elder Wang Hui to tell him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Grab yours today.\"\"Opportunity? What opportunity?\" Su Mo asked, with a puzzled look on his face.Wang Hui just smiled and said nothing, which made Su Mo even more curious.Elder Wei's abode was near the Outer Elders' Palace. It was a magnificent small palace.\"Come in!\"Elder Wei called out as soon as both of them arrived at the gate.\"Yes, Master!\"Wang Hui bowed with great respect and quickly ushered Su Mo into the palace.\"Master?\"Su Mo was shocked upon hearing that Elder Wei was Wang Hui's master.Elder Wei must be very powerful. Even his disciple was an Elder!As they walked into the palace, Su Mo saw Elder Wei.Elder Wei sat on a futon, and he was dressed in simple attire, like any other elderly person.Upon seeing Su Mo, Elder Wei smiled warmly.\"Su Mo, do you want to be my unofficial disciple?\" Elder Wei smiled and asked.\"What?\"Su Mo was taken aback upon hearing this. He had come up with thousands of reasons as to why Elder Wei wanted to see him but never had this thought come to his mind.\"Elder Wei, may I know the reason why you accept me as your disciple? Is it because I emerge as the top in the Qingyuan Trial Test?\"Su Mo chose to ask this question instead of replying immediately.In fact, the thought of learning under a master had never entered Su Mo's mind.\"Every year, there will be someone who will emerge as the top in the Qingyuan Trial Test, and yet I have never accepted anyone as my disciple.\"Elder Wei shook his head.\"Then\u2026?\" Su Mo was baffled.\"It's because of your talent. You're way below the requirement to be my disciple, for your Martial Soul is a Rank 6 Human Class. But you're rich in Blood Qi and have an extraordinary physique. Among those in the Spiritual Martial Realm, none is richer than yours!\"Moreover, you managed to kill the one who is in the Spiritual Martial Realm. Even though you're a half step to this realm, these shows you're highly talented.\"That's why I would like to accept you as my unofficial disciple,\" Elder Wei said.\"Su Mo, are you willing to be my disciple?\" Elder Wei asked once again.Thinking quickly, analyzing the pros and cons, Su Mo could not think of any reason to reject this offer.It would only do Su Mo good having Elder Wei as his master.Elder Wei was not only a very powerful person in the True Spirit Realm but also an influential Outer Elder. To have Elder Wei as his master to back him up would be beneficial to Su Mo.Most importantly, Elder Wei had years of experience. Being under his guidance was much better than scrambling through by himself.Then Su Mo came to a decision.\"I'll only be your unofficial disciple?\"Su Mo asked, with a sparkle in his eyes. \"Why not directly accept me as a pro-disciple since an unofficial disciple doesn't match my strength.\"\"Well, even though you have the talent, your Martial Soul is still off the mark to be my pro-disciple. You need to prove yourself to me,\" Elder Wei smiled and said.\"How do you want me to prove myself?\"\"You have to enter into the top 10 among the Outer Disciples within three years,\" Elder Wei replied.Su Mo raised his eyebrows. If it were six months, that would be too stressful. But in three years? It was very easy for him to enter the top 10 in less than three years.If he needed three years to enter the top 10, it would be impossible for him to challenge Shangguan Hao in the Central Continent in five years.Su Mo immediately nodded his head and said, \"All right, I agree to be your disciple.\"\"Hahaha, that's great!\"Elder Wei smiled, feeling very pleased.Su Mo went through the formality of accepting Elder Wei as his master.\"Junior Brother Su Mo, congratulations!\"Wang Hui cupped his hands together and congratulated Su Mo.\"S\u2026 Senior Brother Wang, thank you!\"Su Mo replied with the same courtesy.\"Hui'er, I want to have a word with Su Mo. You can go first.\"Elder Wei waved his hands at Wang Hui.\"Yes, Master!\"Wang Hui bowed and made his way out, leaving Elder Wei and Su Mo in the room.\"Su Mo, if there is anything doubtful about the cultivation of martial arts, you can ask me now,\" Elder Wei smiled and said.Su Mo nodded his head and immediately shared with Elder Wei the hurdles that he had encountered.After Elder Wei's detailed explanation, Su Mo cleared his doubts and was enlightened.\"Master, is it true that the ranking of a martial artist determines his future achievements?\"Gradually, Su Mo changed the topic pertaining to Martial Souls.\"The different Martial Soul ranks do determine the achievements of the martial artists. Take someone with a Martial Soul of the Rank 6 Human Class for example\u2014if he puts in hard work, and at the same time with given opportunities, then it's possible for him to move on to the True Spirit Realm.\"But, for one with a Martial Soul of the Rank 5 Human Class, no matter how much efforts he puts in, it's impossible for him to reach this Realm,\" Elder Wei said.Su Mo was surprised and thought, \"It seems that there is a big gap between Rank 5 and Rank 6.\" \u00a0If he were of the latter, Su Mo was certain that Elder Wei would not have accepted him as his disciple!Elder Wei continued, \"Of course, this isn't necessarily true in all cases. I've heard there is a rare group of people in this world who have this unique physique. These people are very lucky. Regardless of their Martial Soul rankings, they can still have achievements beyond imagination! But, there aren't many of such people around. Even in the entire Hong Domain, you can't even find one, let alone in Skymoon Country.\"\"Unique physique?\"Su Mo was silent.\"Hahaha, Su Mo, although it's not possible for you to have this unique physique, your physique is way far beyond many others'. This will help you greatly in your journey in martial arts,\" said Elder Wei.Sumo's mouth twitched. It was not true that he had a better physique than others. That was all due to the results of the Elephant's Strength Skill.\"Other than the ranking in Martial Soul, the ability of a person's comprehension plays a very vital role.\"Elder Wei continued, \"For a martial artist, if he has very good comprehension ability, whatever skill he cultivates will improve tremendously. Even if he has a lower-ranked Martial Soul and takes a long time to cultivate, he'll have the ability to kill one at a higher rank than him.\"\"Comprehension?\"Upon hearing this, Su Mo thought to himself. He had all along considered himself to have good comprehension ability, since he had been able to cultivate two Lv 3 skills to the Minor Completion within a short period of time.\"Master, for a martial artist with a very good comprehension, how long would he need to take to cultivate a Lv 3 skill to the Minor Completion Realm?\"Su Mo's eyes sparkled with anticipation.\"Hahaha!\"Elder Wei smiled, shook his head and said, \"Even with a very good comprehension, to cultivate a Lv 3 skill to the Minor Completion requires three to five years at least.\"\"Um!\"Su Mo was stupefied. \"Three to five years? I did it in less than three to five months!\"Su Mo chatted with Elder Wei for two hours before leaving.\u00a0Su Mo benefited a lot from Elder Wei.Su Mo was very grateful to Elder Wei. Even though he was only an unofficial disciple, Elder Wei did not show any sign of impatience, but took the time to explain to him.On his way back, he was feeling very grateful to have such a good master to guide him!Just as he was feeling so, a group of disciples walked towards him and blocked his way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA group of five to six disciples were blocking Su Mo.They were the old batch of outer disciples. They looked bold and arrogant and all of them were experts in the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Uh?\"Su Mo frowned when he saw them blocking his way.\"Are you the new Rookie King, Su Mo?\" asked the leader, a rugged youth, as he stepped forward.\"Yes! May I know your intention?\"Su Mo was expressionless.\"We are from the Fight Alliance. My name is Yu Xiong. I am hereby inviting you to join the Fight Alliance and work for Senior Brother Gu Zhan.\"The rugged youth laughed loudly and said, \"How's that? Aren't you excited?\"Su Mo shook his head and said dismissively, \"I am not interested in the Fight Alliance!\"Su Mo was trying to leave after answering.Yu Xiong was shocked. His expression changed. The invitation of a new disciple had been unexpectedly rejected.It was obvious that Su Mo looked down upon their Fight Alliance.He felt a little embarrassed.\"Stop!\"Yu Xiong quickly stopped Su Mo and thundered, \"You dare to refuse the invitation! Do you know the strength of our Fight Alliance?\"\"I don't want to know. Get out of the way!\" Su Mo said coldly.It was weird for him to be so arrogant if he was trying to recruit him.\"So ungrateful!\"Yu Xiong said sullenly, \"Our Fight Alliance is one of the strongest powers in the outer alliance. Senior Brother Gu Zhan, the head of alliance, is one of the 10 outer disciples. You dare to reject it?\"\"Hehe, interesting!\"Su Mo said dismissively with a sardonic look on his face, \"Do I have to join your Fight Alliance upon your invitation? I am ungrateful if I reject?\"\"Su Mo, we want to invite you because we can see your potential is not bad. You're thinking too highly of yourself!\"Yu Xiong sneered.\"It doesn't matter how highly I'm thinking of myself. I am definitely not joining your Fight Alliance!\"Su Mo turned around and left.\"Since you're not willing to join us, you will be attacked!\"Yu Xiong yelled coldly. A giant palm print suddenly gushed out from the sky.The giant almost-solid genuine Qi palm print attacked Su Mo from behind.A dash of cold light flashed from Su Mo's eyes. He was being attacked simply because he had rejected their invitation to join the Fight Alliance.It was an extremely strong hit. Even a Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist might not be able to block it.Su Mo turned around and threw a fist towards the palm print.Boom!The palm print broke. Su Mo instantly flew backward over 10 meters and shouted angrily.\"I'll remember this hit, Yu Xiong!\"Yu Xiong hummed with disdain and said, \"You're just a nobody! You may be dominating among the new disciples, but you're nothing in front of me!\"Su Mo returned to his dwelling, with a gloomy look.He might have been injured by Yu Xiong's hit if he had not strong enough.One would only be bullied on Gale Island if he was without sufficient potential.\"I must first increase the level of my Martial Soul.\"After muttering to himself, Su Mo drew 100 Class 3 Lv 2 Beast Soul Crystals out and released his Martial Soul to start devouring.Boom! Boom! Boom!Each of the Soul Crystals was broken into pieces and Su Mo devoured them.A Class 3 Lv 2 Beast Soul was very strong. It was more than 10 times stronger than a Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Soul.The effect of 100 Class 3 Lv 2 Beast Souls could be compared to 10,000 Class 1 Lv 2 Beast Souls.Su Mo continuously devoured. His devouring Martial Spirit finally transformed again after he had swallowed 90 Beast Souls.Boom! Boom!His Devouring Martial Soul trembled continuously. The eighth yellow halo suddenly appeared, and all eight yellow light rays were shining extremely brightly at the same time.Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class!Su Mo felt relieved. The Class 3 Lv 2 Beast Souls indeed had not disappointed him.Su Mo swallowed the remaining 10 Beast Souls.The Martial Soul in the room was suddenly whistling as Su Mo quietly urged his Martial Soul. It actually made the wind howl.\"It's so powerful!\"Su Mo was surprised. His Martial Soul had advanced and the speed of Spiritual Qi absorption sharply increased again.\"It's time to devour Empty Spirit Fruits!\"Su Mo got up and left the room.On an untraversed cliff within a cloud of fog on Gale Island.Su Mo was standing quietly with a long sword on his back.He took two Empty Spirit Fruits out and swallowed them at the same time.The Empty Spirit Fruits in his stomach instantly exploded into a wisp of warm strength and rushed straight to his head.The light in his gaze was instantly circulating. He felt as if he was falling into a sudden awakening.Clash!The gemmed long sword left its sheath and the sword radiance scattered. A sharp sword Qi silently cut the cloud in front of him into two.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Another sword was released. The sword Qi transformed into a few wisps of wind blades and cut both of the separated clouds into broken pieces.Su Mo applied the Qi, stepped forward, and waved his sword.The wind was blowing inconsistently on the mountaintop. It would be calm and quiet one minute, but the wind would be whizzing strongly the next.Only the shining sword radiance and free-roaming sword Qi could be seen.Su Mo felt that he had fallen into a mysterious state of Empty Spirit. The awareness of Divine Wind Swordplay continuously gushed into his heart.A lot of obscurities from the past were instantly coming into light.Su Mo's sword skills were increasingly graceful and fierce with his continuously expanding awareness.The four techniques of Divine Wind Swordplay came alive in his hand. The swordsmanship move was swaying wantonly and freely without any restraint.The sword in his hand was freely destroying everything in the vacant space as if it had suddenly been transformed into a wisp of wind.Wind was no longer simply wind in his awareness. It was transformed into wisps of determined sword Qi that could kill everything.Two hours flew by quickly.Su Mo was finally recovering from the state of Empty Spirit. He was filled with delight.\"The Great Completion Realm!\"Su Mo's Divine Wind Swordplay had further improved from the Minor Completion to the Great Completion Realm with surging potential within two hours.Su Mo quietly exclaimed to himself that Empty Spirit Fruit indeed lived up to its reputation.\"But, what's going on with this?\"Su Mo was a little bit curious.He changed his intention and a few imaginary sword shadows instantly appeared in the air. The sword shadows were like a strong wind that blew quietly into the clouds, cutting the clouds into pieces again.He changed his intention again and the imaginary sword shadows instantly disappeared without a trace.\"Is this sword will?\"After a short contemplation, Su Mo was suddenly enlightened. He frowned.He remembered his father, Su Hong, had mentioned before that a strong martial artist could be aware of the martial will.There were various types of martial will. The will of a knivesman's awareness was called saber will, and the will of swordsman's awareness was called sword will.The martial will was ethereally surreal. It might be impossible for most people to ever come to this awareness in their entire lives. Only a few strong and ingenious martial artists could become aware of the martial will.Martial will was very helpful in increasing a martial artist's potential.The martial artist who was aware of martial will could easily defeat his opponents at the same stage in a battle.\"It must be sword will!\"Su Mo's eyes shone brightly.He inhaled deeply and suppressed his excitement before continuing to practice his sword skills.He did not swallow the remaining two Empty Spirit Fruits. He planned to keep them for future use since they were so magical.Furthermore, even if he ate the fruits now, it was not possible for him to achieve the Completion Realm of Divine Wind Swordplay.A scroll, the Nine Raiper Movements of The Wind Devil , appeared in his hand.Although Nine Raiper Movements of The Wind Devil was only a Medium Lv 2 sword skill and it was not as strong as Divine Wind Swordplay, it was the most suitable for his martial arts techniques at the current stage.After all, his martial arts attack techniques were too unitary because aside from Divine Wind Swordplay, he had only one Medium Lv 1 skill, Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist.Although Divine Wind Swordplay was powerful, it consumed too much genuine Qi. Thus, it was not suitable to use in any long fight.There were a total of nine techniques in Nine Raiper Movements of The Wind Devil.The first three techniques did not have names.The next six techniques after that were respectively named Sword Essence of The Wind Devil, Cross Chopping Technique of The Wind Devil, Blood Rain of The Wind Devil, Piercing The Wind Devil, Dancing of The Wind Devil, and Amazing Chopping Technique of The Wind Devil.This sword skill was similarly related to wind, with a sharp attack and uncanny change.The first technique.The second technique.The third technique.With water-like sword radiance, Su Mo started to practice each of the techniques and skills.He cultivated his solidification and genuine Qi hard at night for the following two weeks. In the mornings, he would come up to the mountaintop to cultivate his sword skills and footwork.After half a month, Su Mo's cultivation reached the Minor Completion Realm for the first five techniques of Nine Raiper Movements of The Wind Devil.Compared with Divine Wind Swordplay, it was much easier for Su Mo to cultivate Swordplay of The Wind Devil.At the moment, Su Mo's cultivation was completely solidified.It was time to break through to the Spiritual Martial Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiaohu, you've entered the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm, but you are still far from my level!\" Li Feng laughed and said loudly.Niu Xiaohu stopped attacking and said with a smile, \"It seems like the injury of Li Feng is getting better!\"Seeing Su Mo coming, Niu Xiaohu smiled and said, \"Senior Brother Su Mo!\"Su Mo nodded with a smile.Li Feng saw Su Mo, and said with surprise and amazement, \"Su Mo, you... broke into the Spiritual Martial Realm?\"Now for Su Mo, his breath was vigorous and his sight was deep, and his temperament was different from before.\"Good!\"Su Mo nodded.Li Feng began to feel depressed, as he thought his Martial Soul talent was higher than Su Mo's, however, Su Mo stepped into the Spiritual Martial Realm faster than him.It made him felt dejected.\"Really? Senior Brother Su Mo, have you become an expert in the Spiritual Martial Realm?\"Niu Xiaohu screamed and said with praise, \"Senior Brother Su Mo, you are indeed the best new disciple!\"After hearing that, Su Mo shook his head and said, \"Xiaohu, it's not worth mentioning. You should remember we will contest with all disciples, not just a few new disciples.\"\"Oh!\"Niu Xiaohu nodded.\"Well, I'm ready to accept a Sect mission. Maybe I'll leave Gale Island for a while. You take care!\" Su Mo said to both of them.\"Accept a mission?\"Niu Xiaohu was surprised and said in a hurry, \"Brother Su Mo, I have heard that the Sect missions are always very dangerous. Many disciples failed and died. You should be careful!\"\"Don't worry. I will take care.\"Su Mo nodded.Immediately, Su Mo took four Spiritual Herbs from the storage ring and handed them to them.\"These are four Spiritual Herbs of Lower Lv 2. Two herbs for each of you. I hope you can step into the Spiritual Martial Realm as soon as possible.\"Both of them were surprised. Li Feng said in a hurry, \"Su Mo, I won't take your Spiritual Herbs, which I will obtain by relying on my own power.\"Niu Xiaohu shook his head also, \"Senior Brother Su Mo, I know that no gain can come without pain. You just keep the Spiritual Herbs for yourself!\"Su Mo was speechless. He wanted to give the Spiritual Herbs away, but nobody wanted them.Of course, he knew that because Li Feng had strong self-esteem, he would not accept Su Mo's gift.However, Niu Xiaohu, whose disposition was modest, refused Su Mo as well.\"I still have Spiritual Herbs, and the reason why I give the Spiritual Herbs to you is that I hope you can get rid of the identity of Handyman Disciple early. We can make a living wandering the world together at that time. How cool it can be!\"Without any other words, Su Mo put the four Spiritual Herbs into their hands and quickly left the courtyard.Li Feng two persons were still Handyman Disciples and they still needed to do chores, which was very bitter.Only by stepping into the Spiritual Martial Realm could they get rid of doing chores.Now, four Spiritual Herbs of Lower Lv 2 were not important to Su Mo.They could only enhance his cultivation a little bit, not enough for him to break through the cultivation. It was better for him to swallow blood essence.Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu held the Spiritual Herbs in their hands. They were speechlessly frozen, and they were touched.There were three huge palaces in the mission palace.It was divided into the Outer Mission Hall, the Inner Mission Hall, and the Core Mission Hall.The Outer Gate was definitely in the Outer Mission Hall.It was very lively with the crowd in the hall when Su Mo went to the Outer Mission Hall.The Outer Disciples of Gale Island were the most populous group with almost 1,000 people.Except for a small number of disciples that only had Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation, the rest of them had the cultivation of the Spiritual Martial Realm.Mission hall was the most active place for the Outer Disciples.In the mission hall, there were over a dozen billboards placed inside.On each billboard, many Sect missions were attached.As for these Sect missions, some were published by the Sect, some were published privately, and some were published by people outside the island that were entrusted by the Sect.Anybody could publish a mission as long as they had a need.For example, if Su Mo needed something, he could also publish a mission and let other people find it for him.However, he needed to pay a certain reward.All rewards of the published missions would be changed into contribution points after the Sect platform.The Sect would also reward the one who completed a mission with contribution points, even for a mission published by people outside of the island, after the mission was finished and money was paid by the publisher to Gale Island.After all, contribution points could be treated as the current fortune on Gale Island.Su Mo walked towards a billboard and looked up.\"Find one Spiritual Herb of Lower Lv 1 and Nine Patches Detoxification Grass. The time limit is half a month. The reward is 10 contribution points. And the degree of difficulty is one star...\"\"Kill two bullies of the Lus. The time limit is one month. The reward is 40 contribution points. And the degree of mission difficulty is three stars...\"\"...\"The rewards of Sect missions were great. The more difficult the missions were, the higher the rewards would be.\"Uh?\"At this time, Su Mo saw one mission among them and stopped immediately.\"Kill the Bloody Blade Stockade in Sirius Mountain. The time limit is one month. The reward is 50 contribution points. The degree of mission difficulty is three and a half stars.\"There was a detailed introduction of the Bloody Blade Stockade on the mission list.\"The chief of the Bloody Blade Stockade, who is called Blood Blade, is at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm. In the brigands, two deputy chiefs are at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm. Under the command, four protectors are at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm. Inside the brigands, there are 800 bandits with a Qi Cultivation Realm with different cultivations.\"\"The strength of the Bloody Blade Stockade is so strong!\"Su Mo remembered that some bandits of the Bloody Blade Stockade sacked Guclan Village. Su Mo killed the bandits and saved Xi'er.The highest cultivation was Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm for the bandits during that time. Thus,\u00a0Su Mo thought that the Bloody Blade Stockade was only a group of bandits in the Qi Cultivation Realm, in which he never thought that the number of martial artists in the Spiritual Martial Realm could be seven.Su Mo took the mission sheet without any hesitation.The Bloody Blade Stockade was a group of scumbags, who burned, looted and raped. It was justice to wipe them out.\"Who is that guy? He is taking the three-and-a-half-star mission with only Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm cultivation!\"\"It is absolutely a suicide mission to take a mission of three and a half stars with such cultivation!\"\"Haha, I know who he is. He is the best new disciple this term. I think his name is Su Mo!\"\"The best new disciple? No wonder he is so confident! The best new disciple is just the bottom of the whole Outer Disciples.\"The Outer Disciples around Su Mo saw him taking the mission list of the Bloody Blade Stockade and began discussing.However, most of them were words of disparagement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The difficulty of three and a half stars was close to his limit. It would be pretty hard for him to accomplish if the difficulty increased any more.He took down three mission sheets, registered with the elder of the mission hall, and left.Several outer disciples noticed Su Mo and shook their heads. They thought that he would not come back since he'd taken down three difficult missions.But Su Mo's life or death was none of their business. They would not stop him.Stepping out of the mission hall, he saw three outer disciples walking towards the hall.Obviously, Yan Qi and Feng Zilan were among them.Between Yan Qi and Feng Zilan, there was a youth who looked fair and clear.\"Su Mo!\"Seeing Su Mo at distance, Yan Qi shouted angrily. With quick steps, he hastened towards him.\"Su Mo, you snatched our storage pouches! I have not forgotten!\" Yan Qi shouted.\"Now, it's time for you to pay the price,\" Feng Zilan said, laughing coldly.\"Just you two?\" Su Mo said indifferently, paying no attention to Yan Qi and Feng Zilan.He focused on the youth beside them.This man had very strong strength, maybe even stronger than Yu Xiong.\"Haha! Do you think it is still the other day? Zilan and I have both broken through to the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm. We are many times stronger than we were at the Qingyuan Trial Test.\"Yan Qi said with a wild laugh and continued, \"Moreover, today we have Brother Shen Qing with us. We are not afraid of you playing tricks.\"The fair and clear youth, Shen Qing, looked at Su Mo. He scoffed and said, \"I don't want to put you on the spot. If you can compensate for the loss of Brother Yan Qi and Sister Zilan, and serve me as your master and obey all my orders from now on, I can spare your life.\"\"Serve you as my master and obey all your orders? And then you can spare my life?\"Su Mo darkened his face. His eyes were cold.What a conceited and arrogant man!A mocking smile curved Su Mo's lips. \"Does your family know how arrogant you are?\"Shen Qing was stunned for the moment. Then he raged with killing intention filling his eyes.\"You're counting to your death!\"With a cold shout, Shen Qing's vigor, which was at the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, suddenly soared up to the sky. He punched Su Mo with one fist.His enormous imposing manner froze the air before his fist force arrived in front of Su Mo.Slice!Su Mo stabbed his sword into Shen Qing's fist.Bang!Shen Qing did not turn a hair. Su Mo recoiled with several steps in succession.\"Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm! Impressive!\"Su Mo said to himself, \"It's really hard for me to defeat him if I don't use all my strength.\"Shen Qing raised his fist up and put it in front of his eyes with a slight frown.There was a small sword cut on his fist. A thread of scarlet oozed from the cut.Shen Qing's look turned gloomy immediately. Even martial artists at the same level could not break the genuine Qi concentrated on his fist. How could he be hurt by a nonentity at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm! The killing intention was growing in his heart.Yan Qi and Feng Zilan were both shocked too. They had not expected that Su Mo's cultivation had achieved the Spiritual Martial Realm. Not to mention that he could take a punch from Shen Qing.Their conflict had attracted attention. Many people from the mission hall came towards and watched them.\"That's Shen Qing, why is he fighting with this guy?\"\"Shen Qing is a member of the Sky Alliance. The guy offended him. Does he want to die?\"People cried out in alarm.\"Su Mo, today, I want you dead!\"With a raging shout, genuine Qi swarmed in Shen Qing's body from head to toe. His fist was curled with genuine Qi.Everyone held their breath in anticipation.No disciple would dare to kill people within the sphere of Sect,\u00a0except members of the Sky Alliance.As the most powerful force among the disciples of Gale Island, even many elders did not have the courage to offend the Sky Alliance. Instead, they chose to be friendly to them.The leader of the Sky Alliance, Duan Jingtian, owned limitless talent and an Earth Class Martial Soul. As one of Four Talents of Skymoon Country, he ranked at the top of the young generation of Skymoon Country.There had been a lot of rumors about Duan Jingtian that he would be the future Gale Island owner.Su Mo's vigor was rising. His eyes were filled with killing intent.His opponent wanted to kill him. The feeling was mutual.He was an unofficial disciple of Elder Wei. Being a protege of such a patron, it would not be a big deal for him to kill an outer disciple.\"Stop!\"At this explosive moment, a loud voice came bursting.The crowd parted, and a forbidding youth aged about 27 or 28 came over.He was the Outer Elder, Wang Hui.\"What's going on?\"Wang Hui shouted in anger.\"Elder Wang, this man is so arrogant that he looks down his nose at our Sky Alliance. I just want to teach him a lesson.\"Shen Qing deliberately emphasized the words \"Sky Alliance\". How absolutely clear his threat was!He did not plan to stop just because an elder had interfered.\"Ridiculous!\"People's eardrums were shaken to buzzing by Wang Hui's irate shout.How could Wang Hui not get the implication of the threat? He simply didn't care. He immediately shouted, \"Gale Island strictly forbids personal combat. If you don't stop now, you will be punished by sect rules!\"Standing in amazement of his words, Shen Qing frowned and asked, \"Wang Hui, don't you give face to the Sky Alliance?\"With no expression, Wang Hui said coldly, \"Face is earned. I'll allow face to Duan Jingtian. However, you, such an outer disciple, dare to offend me, an elder. Leave now! Otherwise, I will punish you for the guilt of offending an elder.\"With a gloomy expression, Shen Qing gave Su Mo a dark look. Reluctantly he said, \"You were lucky today, Su Mo!\"Shen Qing waved and said to Yan Qi and Feng Zilan, \"Let's go!\"Yan Qi and Feng Zilan looked unhappy. They thought they could easily crucify Su Mo this turn. Unexpectedly Su Mo's strength had improved greatly and an elder had come out to interfere. What's more, the elder did not give face to the Sky Alliance at all.The three were about to leave.\"Wait!\"The voice came from Su Mo.The three looked at him with confusion.\"Shen Qing, when I finish my missions, let's fight for life or death at Decisive Struggle Hall!\"Su Mo's voice sounded throughout and astonished everyone. At the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, this guy wanted to fight with Shen Qing, who was at the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm!Decisive Struggle Hall was a place for disciples of Gale Island to solve their resentment. They could fight for life or death by their own free will. The Sect would not have a hand in it.Shen Qing was stunned and then smiled. He scoffed and said, \"A nonentity wants to fight with me? Fine, Su Mo, I am waiting for you! Let's fight for life or death at Decisive Struggle Hall.\"Su Mo nodded.\"Be careful when you're implementing the missions. Otherwise, you'll die before I kill you. That's boring!\"Finishing these words, Shen Qing smiled and left with Yan Qi and Feng Zilan.He would definitely kill Su Mo in the fight at Decisive Struggle Hall.On the way, Yan Qi said to Shen Qing, \"Brother Shen, if you can kill Su Mo at Decisive Struggle Hall, I'll make sure my brother rewards you with plenty.\"Shen Qing felt happy inwardly but remained calm and said, \"Hehe, no need for reward. Senior Brother Yan Ba is an inner disciple. How can I ask for any reward! And you two are now members of the Sky Alliance too. Certainly, I'm on your side.\"Yan Qi and Feng Zilan nodded together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you fight him in the Decisive Struggle Hall, I'm afraid it won't be in your favor!\"\"Brother Wang, don't worry! Since I want to fight to death with him, I feel quite assured about this,\" said Su Mo with a laugh and a confident look on his face.Wang Hui was slightly shocked by Su Mo's confidence and said with a nod, \"Since you're so sure about yourself, then I won't inquire further, but...\"Wang Hui's expression suddenly became serious, and he said, \"In the future, you should avoid antagonizing the Sky Alliance!\"\"Why?\" asked Su Mo.Wang Hui sighed and said gently, \"The leader of the Sky Alliance, Duan Jingtian, is a peerless genius and the pride of Gale Island. His cultivation is much stronger than even an elder like me, and the Sky Alliance is very powerful, so many elders are on their side.\"Gale Island may seem peaceful, but under the surface, it is very turbulent. There are endless conflicts between the different factions.\"The island owner is very old and is considering passing on his position. In just a few years, when Duan Jingtian can hold his own, he will definitely become the new Gale Island owner.\"So, it's very foolish of you to antagonize the Sky Alliance!\"The good thing is that Shen Qing is only a minor player in the Sky Alliance. Even if you kill him, with the protection of Master and I, his death won't be enough incentive for the Sky Alliance to ruin ties with us.\"Wang Hui explained the power dynamics carefully to Su Mo.\"Master used to be one of the ten great elders of the inner elders group, but he didn't want to involve himself in the power struggles of the sect. So he voluntarily transferred to become one of the three outer overseeing elders. With Master's abilities, as long as you don't bother the Sky Alliance, then no one can hurt you on Gale Island!\" said Wang Hui seriously, looking at Su Mo.Su Mo was shocked. He used to think that Elder Wei was only highly regarded in outer organizations, but it seemed now that he knew very little about this master.\"He used to be one of the ten great elders of the elders group?\"\"That means that Master's abilities are at the top of Gale Island, if not at the peak.\"\"Don't worry, Brother! As long as the Sky Alliance doesn't bother me, I also won't bother them.\"Su Mo nodded his head.Wang Hui shook his head resignedly. Although his disciple brother seemed gentle, he was actually very rebellious.He told Su Mo all this so that Su Mo would sheath his weapons and defer to the Sky Alliance.\"Yet, Su Mo is now actively provoking them! If they bother you, would you actually seek revenge from them?\"\"Brother, watch out for yourself!\"Wang Hui finally sighed and turned around to leave.As he watched Wang Hui walk away, Su Mo furrowed his brows in thought. He had not expected there to be such complicated issues in Gale Island.After a while, Su Mo shook his head. None of this mattered at the moment, and his current priority was to work hard to improve his abilities.Su Mo walked out of the sect, came to the harbor of Gale Island, and took a boat to get out of Gale Island.The harbor had a large number of steel boats that sailed regularly, so the Gale Island disciples could sail for free.However, one had to pay to hire boats, if he was in a rush or wanted to sail alone.Su Mo stood at the stern of the boat as it sailed on Star-water Lake, gazing over the surface of it.One month ago, he had come to Gale Island at only Lv 8 Qi cultivation Realm.Now, he was already a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm and had already had qualifications to enter the real martial world.Demonic beasts occasionally appeared at the surface of Star-water Lake, spitting up columns of water or stirring up waves.However, none of them dared to come within two and a half kilometers from the boat.This route had been used by Gale Island for centuries, so any demonic beast that dared to cross into the route would definitely be killed.After some time, even the unintelligent demonic beasts understood that this territory was off-limits.After two hours' sailings, the sailboat reached the harbor of Waterside City.Su Mo ate at the Greeting Guests Inn, bought a premium cyan mane horse, and rode away.Yellowstone City, a remote small city, was one thousand kilometer away from Gale Island.This city was much smaller than Yunyang City, with a low city wall and a population of less than 100,000. The term \"town\" was a more fitting description.A young man wearing a white robe was riding a horse down a city street.It was Su Mo himself.Yellowstone City was his first stop.His mission at this stop was to kill a man called Jade-faced Playboy.\"According to the mission data, the mission was requested by the Huang family of Yellowstone City, so I'll go to the Huang's first.\"Su Mo asked around to find the location of the Huang Family.The Huang Family was one of the two great families in Yellowstone City, and it was known to all citizens.Soon, Su Mo came to a mansion that had \"Huang Family\" elaborately written on its door.\"Who are you?\" Two guards in front of the mansion immediately yelled as soon as Su Mo approached them, glaring at him cautiously.\"I'm a disciple of Gale Island, here to see your Master,\" Su Mo said.\"A disciple of Gale Island?\"The two guards were surprised, glanced at Su Mo, and said with their fists clasped, \"Honored Sir, how can you prove that you're a disciple of Gale Island?\"Su Mo shook his head. These two guards were so devoted to their position.However, he did not want to cause any trouble, so he took out his jade identification badge.The Gale Island jade identification badge was completely smooth and empty on the front, and it had \"Gale Island\" written on the back.The two guards saw Su Mo's jade identification badge and immediately bowed respectfully.\"Please enter, Sir. I will notify Master right away.\"One of the guards took Su Mo into the mansion, while the other went to pass along the news.Su Mo heard a peal of joyful laughter as soon as he entered the Huang lobby, and a chubby middle-aged man walked out.\"Ha ha! What an honor to receive a disciple of Gale Island. I apologize for the humble lodgings!\"The middle-aged man walked into the lobby, laughing, but he furrowed his brows as soon as he saw Su Mo.\"You're the Huang Family Master?\" asked Su Mo.\"Yes. My name is Huang Houde. Please come in!\"The middle-aged man's brows softened again, and he nodded.In the lobby, Huang Houde and Su Mo sat down.\"Master Huang, where is Jade-faced Playboy?\" asked Su Mo bluntly.Huang Houde did not answer Su Mo immediately, but paused for a while and asked nervously, \"May I ask what your cultivation is?\"Su Mo was shocked but answered honestly, \"Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.\"\"Ah!\"To Su Mo's surprise, Huang Houde immediately sighed and said, \"Sir, please go back! How can someone with a cultivation of Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm compete with Jade-faced Playboy?\"He had just seen how young Su Mo was, and now he was even more disappointed to learn that he only had a cultivation of Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.Now, he just wanted to make sure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mo was simply too young. He looked like he was only a 15- or 16-year-old teenager, with just a cultivation at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.No wonder Huang Houde felt disappointed.\"Master Huang, you don't need to worry. You only need to tell me where Jade-faced Playboy is,\" Su Mo said with a laugh.\"Sir, you have no idea, Jade-faced Playboy is a Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist. He is extremely powerful. Half a month ago, I joined forces with some of my clan members who were Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists, but we still couldn't defeat him. If you go impulsively, you might just die in vain.\"Huang Houde spoke with a solemn face. He was very doubtful about Su Mo.How could a Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist be a match for a Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist?Su Mo looked at Huang Houde and realized that he only had a cultivation at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.An average Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist, together with a few at Lv 1, was definitely not a match for a Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.Su Mo shooked his head. It seemed that he needed to show his capability, otherwise, he would not be totally trusted by him.\"Master Huang, look out for the sword!\"So Mo used his two fingers to represent a sword and pointed directly at Huang Houde.An extremely sharp white light pierced a hole in the air. In the blink of an eye, it was right in front of Huang Houde.\"Huff!\"Huang Houde shouted and punched the white light.\"Boom!\"Both of their attacks collided, causing a loud blast wave. The impact of the collision smashed several tables and chairs in the hall into broken pieces.Boom! Boom! Boom!Huang Houde backed off a few steps, and his back cracked the hard wall in the living room.\"You're... you're actually so powerful!\"Huang Houde was in shock. But then, instead of being angry, he was pleased to say, \"Sir, I never expected you to be so powerful. This is great! My revenge is hopeful!\"At the same time, Huang Houde was scolding himself for being foolish. Su Mo was a disciple of Gale Island, hence, he could not be measured by normal standards.Since Su Mo dared to take on this mission, he should be pretty confident. However, he actually underestimated Su Mo's capability earlier on.Su Mo nodded and curiously asked, \"Master Huang, what's your feud with Jade-faced Playboy?\"Upon hearing that, Huang Houde showed a painful look, grinding his teeth in anger and said, \"Jade-faced Playboy came to Yellowstone City three months ago. This man is a beast. He is immorally evil and targets young women. He abuses them and tortures them to death. My little girl was killed by him. She was totally naked when she died and was beyond recognition.\"Within a short span of three months, he had already harmed more than 100 young women. He's simply worse than a beast.\"I had meant to kill him myself. When he first came to Yellowstone City, his cultivation was only at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm. But who knows, within a short time span, he had already achieved Lv 3. No one in my clan is a match for him. If not for the solid foundation of my clan, the whole clan would have already been exterminated by him.\"That's why I seek the help of Gale Island. I hope Gale Island will send some disciples to kill this person.\"Sir, I beg you to help me.\"After saying that, Huang Houde respectfully bowed toward Su Mo.He hated Jade-faced Playboy to the core. So long as someone could kill him, he was willing to pay whatever price was asked.\"This is my mission, I'll definitely do it.\"Su Mo nodded and asked again, \"Where is Jade-faced Playboy?\"\"Right here in the city, I'm very sure of where he stays. Sir, please wait for a second!\"After saying that, Huang Houde instructed his guard outside the living room. \"Go and get the three elders.\"Su Mo did\u00a0not understand the purpose of Huang Houde inviting his clan's elders over.But, he did not ask.After waiting for a while, three middle-aged men in their 40s came over to the living room.Huang Houde introduced them. All three of them paid their respects to Su Mo.\"Sir, that Jade-faced Playboy is very powerful. The four of us shall be going to help you as well.\"Huang Houde said as he stood up, \"Let's go!\"Su Mo shook his head helplessly. It seemed like they still worried about his capabilities.\"Sir, that's where Jade-faced Playboy stays.\"Su Mo and the four elders stood in a tower in the northern region of Yellowstone City, looking at a far away luxury house. Huang Houde spoke to Su Mo.\"Sir, we have to be extremely cautious. If you can attack him from his back, then together with the joint forces of the four of us, we should be able to kill him,\" Huang Houde said with a solemn face.Su Mo sighed helplessly. He intended to directly attack to fight the Jade-faced Playboy.Since his strength had already improved. Moreover, he had also comprehended the meaning of the legendary sword will and planned to give it a try.However, Huang Houde was being extremely cautious. He wanted to wait for the best opportunity to strike, which made Su Mo feel depressed.\"Erm?\"Suddenly, their eyes condensed.Not far away, there was a young woman in purple quickly flying over. She reached Jade-faced Playboy's garden in a split second.\"Rapist, come out and I'll kill you!\"The lady in purple was very violent. With a loud shout, she held a longsword to chop the courtyard door.Boom!The iron-clad courtyard door was like tofu smashed into pieces when it was split by the sword.\"Who is this lady?\" Su Mo asked Huang Houde.This lady's breath was very powerful. She was a martial artist at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.Huang Houde shook his head, and the three elders of the Huang clan also had no idea.When the door was broken into pieces, an angry shout came from the courtyard. \"Who has the audacity to disturb me? You're courting death!\"A youth who was not properly dressed swiftly dashed out from the courtyard.This youth was extraordinarily handsome, like a lady with fair skin and distinctive features.Even though this youth was handsome, his eyes were filled with evil that gave one a ghastly feeling.At this moment, the youth was not properly dressed and was very angry.\"Who are you?\"As the handsome youth saw the lady in purple at the door, suddenly, his eyes glowed with a kinky look.The lady in purple was around 17 or 18 years old. She was beautiful with a hot figure. Her tight-fitting purple clothing fully portrayed her perfect curvy figure.\"An Outer Disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect, Yang Zhixuan.\"The lady in purple loudly shouted with a cold look, \"You're Jade-faced Playboy? Are you going to punish yourself, or you prefer me to kill you?\"\"A Disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect?\"Upon hearing this, Jade-faced Playboy narrowed his eyes.For the past year, there were many people going after his life. He never expected that even a disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect, one of the four sects, was also going after him.One year ago, the Jade-faced Playboy got ahold of an odd martial art. This martial art was very powerful. It relied on sexual intercourse with virgins in order to seize their Qi of Original Yin to improve one's cultivation.Within a short time span of one year,\u00a0whereby he practiced the odd martial art, he had now already achieved Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm from his initial Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.His Martial Soul was only a Rank 3 Human Class. Based on the usual standards of practice, in order to achieve his current realm, it would have taken him at least 15 years time.He was extremely pleased with such a fast cultivating speed.For the past year, he had been seizing young women in order to cultivate this odd martial art.But, because of this, he had also offended a lot of people. There were people who wanted to kill him wherever he went.However, he was very lucky. He always managed to escape unscathed.Ever since then, whenever he seized a young woman, he would abuse and torture them after the sexual intercourse to vent his frustrations.He escaped to this remote small town in order to avoid being hunted by the stronger martial artists.\"It seems like I need to get out of this place and find somewhere else!\"Jade-faced Playboy silently sighed.Then, he looked at the lady in purple and kinkily smiled, \"A disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect? I've met countless women, but I've never enjoyed a beautiful woman from a big sect. I wonder what it feels like! God has been really kind to me and actually sends me the best one.\"My little beauty, today I shall let you enjoy the pleasure of my company, enjoy the bliss of extreme happiness! Hahahaha!\"Jade-faced Playboy laughed, feeling excited.\"Rapist, you are courting your death!\"Hearing that, Yang Zhixuan's pretty face turned livid with a strong killing desire in her eyes.Without hesitation, she stabbed Jade-faced Playboy with her sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stabbed directly toward the chest of Jade-faced Playboy.Jade-faced Playboy turned aside slightly, shattered the sword shadow with one palm, and swung his sword.In no time, his right hand turned into a claw, which grabbed at Yang Zhixuan's fair neck.Yang Zhixuan took up her sword to resist.Bang!Jade-faced Playboy's palm fell on the longsword, and both of them retreated at the same time.\"Rogue, you must die!\"Yang Zhixuan shouted delicately, and her sword split through the air toward him.\"Rainbow Swordplay!\"The shining sword radiance burst into a huge seven-colored Sword Qi, beautiful as a dream, and chopped toward Jade-faced Playboy like lightning.\"Break!\" Jade-faced Playboy shouted and did not back down.Before it could be noticed, a waving folding fan appeared in his hand, which was as sharp as a good sword, that had easily broken the Seven-colored Sword Qi.\"Little beauty, I couldn't bear hurting you. Give in quickly.\"Jade-faced Playboy teased her.\"In your dreams! Anyone who meets you will desire to kill you, you dirty rogue.\"Yang Zhixuan growled angrily, and her longsword was shaking consistently, with seven-colored Sword Qi soaring in every direction.\"Rainbow Illusive Cut!\"\"Tianyin One Hit!\"Jade-faced Playboy did not show any impression of weakness and was well matched in strength with Yang Zhixuan even with only a folding fan in his hand.Peng, Peng, Peng...!Their shadows were flickering. Sword Qi was soaring. The sound of explosions was endless, and the fierce wave of Qi was rolling from all sides.The two of them fought back and forth, having had more than 10 strokes in a minute.They seemed to be equal.Su Mo stood in a far-away tower, watching all of this quietly.\"She must be a disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect!\"Su Mo came to understand that someone else had also assigned the task of killing this man.After watching for a while, Su Mo shook his head. The girl was strong, but she was obviously not strong enough to overpower Jade-faced Playboy.The girl's cultivation was obviously better than Jade-faced Playboy's, and she was much better in her cultivation method and martial arts techniques.However, she had so little experience in fighting that her shortcomings were revealed one by one.Moreover, the girl was in such a pursuit of magnificence that she had lost the essence of swordplay.\"Rainbow Glaze Rain!\"Yang Zhixuan was shouting delicately in the field. The massive seven-colored Qi was falling down like soft spring rain, completely covering Jade-faced Playboy.\"Very good!\"Jade-faced Playboy growled loudly. Genuine Qi flowed out of him, supporting a defense shield around him.For a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm, Genuine Qi could flow out from within him. It could make both your attack more powerful and your defense much stronger.Ripples flowed when the massive Seven-colored Sword was chopping on the defense shield.Seeing that the shield was going to be broken, the folding fan in Jade-faced Playboy's hand trembled.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Several rays of light that were hard to observe flashed and then disappeared.The rays of light broke the seal of the Sword Qi and shot toward Yang Zhixuan like lightning.\"Oh no!\"Shocked, Yang Zhixuan found that the rays of light had reached her and that there was nowhere to escape.At that critical moment, she could not do anything but resist with her sword.Yang Zhixuan swayed her longsword, causing a sword curtain.Ding! Ding! Ding!There came several ringing sounds when several silver needles hit the sword curtain and then fell onto the ground.However, there was still a silver needle that had broken through the block of sword curtain and reached Yang Zhixuan's shoulder, drilling into in her flesh and blood.\"Haha, my little beauty, let me see how you can resist now.\"The moment that he won, Jade-faced Playboy burst into laughter.\"Wh-what kind of needle is it?\" Yang Zhixuan asked anxiously.\"Calm down, it is not poison, but just Atony Powder in Three Breaths.\"Jade-faced Playboy's eyes were shining wickedly. He stuck out his bloody tongue and said with a smile, \"Having been poisoned by my Atony Powder in Three Breaths, you will feel sour and powerless, and then, I can do anything to you.\"\"What?\"Shocked, Yang Zhixuan's face became ghastly pale.She quickly felt a sour feeling flowing through her, and all her strength was running out crazily like she was a leaking ball.She could not even operate the Genuine Qi inside of her.\"You beast!\"Her face was pale, and her body was shaky.\"Haha, my little beauty, so far no woman that I have liked has ever escaped from me.\"Jade-faced Playboy laughed and walked toward Yang Zhixuan, looking up and down her curvy body, and said with a lustful smile, \"Haha, I can not wait to...\"\"D-don't come here!\"Yang Zhixuan was so shocked and said worriedly, \"Since my father is an elder in the Sky Yuan Sect, he won't let you go free if you keep on treating me this way!\"\"An elder?\"Jade-faced Playboy hesitated for a second and then said with a disdained smile, \"Even if your father is an elder in the Sky Yuan Sect, what can he do to me? After this, I will leave Skymoon Country. In the big world outside, I don't believe he could find me.\"With these words, Jade-faced Playboy walked toward Yang Zhixuan and was about to grab her.Shocked, Yang Zhixuan's face became ghastly pale and she felt desperate.Her eyes were red, and tears flowed down.How could she have expected that her first task would also be her nightmare?Seeing Jade-faced Playboy's palm approaching her body, she felt determined to kill herself by biting her tongue.Just at this moment, something happened. A sharp Sword Qi stormed from somewhere far away and chopped down on Jade-faced Playboys' head like lightning.\"Who is it?\"Shocked, Jade-faced Playboy had no time to escape and anxiously waved the folding fan in his hand to resist the Sword Qi that was coming toward him.Bang!The Sword Qi was broken, and Jade-faced Playboy retreated from the momentum.Then, he gazed and saw a boy in white walking toward him.His brows were like stars, and his eyes were like cold swords.It was Su Mo. Since Yang Zhixuan had lost, it was his turn to fight.He could not bear to see the girl harmed by Jade-faced Playboy without doing something.The sudden appearance of Su Mo lit Yang Zhixuan's heart. She cried out with joy.\"Who are you?\"Jade-faced Playboy frowned and looked carefully at the boy before him.\"The one that will kill you,\" Su Mo said with a freezing voice, without a trace of emotion.\"Haha!\"Having heard what he said, Jade-faced Playboy burst into laughter once more and said scornfully, \"You are really a boy who is fearless out of ignorance. How could such rubbish at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm dare to declare to kill me?\"That's all right. Let me kill you first and then I'll enjoy the little beauty.\"With a scornful smile, Jade-faced Playboy waved the folding fan in his hand and sharp Genuine Qi chopped toward Su Mo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was ridiculous for a martial artist of the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm to even think of killing him.Even a talented disciple of the four sects could not take on someone two realms higher, let alone to kill that person!\"Be careful!\"Yang Zhixuan screamed as she saw the Genuine Qi saber swing towards Su Mo.Su Mo's sudden arrival was her only hope of escape, thus she did not want him to be killed.\"Don't worry! With me around, you'll be fine!\"Su Mo shot a comforting smile towards Yang Zhixuan.Suddenly, his gaze became fierce, and he swung his sword, releasing the sword Qi that was ten times stronger than before.The sword Qi was as fast as lightning and instantly broke through the Genuine Qi saber and struck the left arm of Jade-faced Playboy.Whoosh!Jade-faced Playboy's left arm fell to the ground.Bright red blood spewed out of his severed arm like a fountain.\"Ah!\"Jade-faced Playboy screamed and retreated quickly.\"How could this be? What is your actual level of cultivation?\"Jade-faced Playboy's face contorted into a terrifying expression due to the sharp pain.He believed that Su Mo must have intentionally concealed his cultivation, otherwise, he could not have counteracted his attack and severed his arm with one blow.Yang Zhixuan was shocked as well. She had not expected this young man in white to be so powerful that he could cause such serious injury to Jade-faced Playboy with just one move.She felt overjoyed and let out a sigh of relief.She could not hold herself together anymore and fell to the ground.Su Mo did not look at Yang Zhixuan because, although Jade-faced Playboy lost an arm, he was still a force to be reckoned with.He could not make the same mistake as Jade-faced Playboy.He would not have lost an arm if he had not underestimated Su Mo.\"You must die today!\" Su Mo said coldly.He rushed forward, and his gem sword turned into shadows that struck 13 times.\"Sword Essence of Wind Devil!\"Sword Essence of Wind Devil was the fourth move of Swordplay of Wind Devil. The thirteen streams of Sword Qi combined to form a giant and powerful sword.\"Damn it!\"Jade-faced Playboy was furious, and the Qi around him increased tremendously. He countered Su Mo's attack with his gleaming folding fan, which was sharper than a long saber.\"Tianyin Sky-splitting Cut!\"Although Jade-faced Playboy was injured, the current Qi in his body was more than twice the amount from when he was battling with Yang Zhixuan.It was obvious that he had not put in his best earlier.Boom!Tianyin Destruction Cut easily destroyed Su Mo's sword.Jade-faced Playboy jumped up, and his folding fan spun into a windmill that cut in all directions crazily.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Su Mo's body was very nimble and left behind countless shadows. He made his way among the sharp sabers and attacked Jade-faced Playboy.Jade-faced Playboy lived up to his name of being a martial artist of the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm. He managed to counteract all of Su Mo's attacks.\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"A strong gale stirred up, and the matchless sword Qi blended into the wind. The gale and sword Qi echoed each other. The sword power was great and the speed became much faster.The gale completely destroyed all of Jade-faced Playboy's attacks.The sword Qi in the air shot towards Jade-faced Playboy with a strong momentum.Since Su Mo had achieved the Great Completion of the Divine Wind Swordplay, his powers greatly increased.Although Jade-faced Playboy's face began to turn pale from the loss of blood, not only did he not weaken, his attacks got stronger.\"Tianyin Sky-splitting Cut!\"Jade-faced Playboy waved his folding fan, and a two-meter-long Genuine Qi saber shot through the air and split the gale into two.The gale dissipated, and the sword Qi disappeared. The Genuine Qi saber remained strong and shot towards Su Mo.Swish!Su Mo avoided the Genuine Qi saber with the Shadow Steps.\"Boy, I'll definitely kill you today!\"Jade-faced Playboy gritted his teeth. He had lost a large amount of blood, which made him very weak. He had to kill Su Mo as quickly as possible.Otherwise, the longer this dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for him.\"Jade-faced Playboy, you are indeed powerful, even stronger than most martial artists of the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Su Mo said, \"But you're still going to die. Bast*rd like you don't have the right to live!\"\"Haha, delusional boy. You'll pay for your delusions.\"Jade-faced Playboy smirked and with a shout, he began to attack Su Mo crazily.\"Tianyin Sky-splitting Cut!\"Jade-faced Playboy's attacks were incredibly powerful. Endless Genuine Qi saber formed a giant and menacing green wheel.Su Mo's expression was slightly grave. Jade-faced Playboy was much more powerful than he had expected, possibly even more powerful than Shen Qing.If he did not use sword will, it would be tough to defeat him within a short period of time.Su Mo was excited to see how powerful his sword will could be.In the next moment, a sword shadow flashed in Su Mo's eyes. A gust of sword Qi shot into the air, causing his clothes to billow and endless power was felt everywhere.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"The power blended into the swordplay, and a stream of astonishing Sword Qi burst out.This stream was three meters long and it looked as if a Wind Sword had pierced through the air, destroying everything.\"What?\"With the blow of the astonishing Sword Qi, Jade-faced Playboy immediately felt a terrifying force. It was as if all the air around him turned into thin blades of wind, cutting into his skin.Puff!The terrifying Wind Sword was unstoppable and immediately shattered the genuine Qi giant wheel. It then flew towards Jade-faced Playboy.Jade-faced Playboy was terrified. The genuine Qi on his skin immediately surged to shield his body.The genuine Qi shield was useless against the Wind Sword, and it immediately dissolved in the blink of an eye.The remaining momentum of sword Qi heavily fell onto Jade-faced Playboy's chest.\"Ah!\"Jade-faced Playboy screamed and was sent crashing into a wall.The wall collapsed, sending debris and smoke everywhere.On a faraway tower, Huang Houde and his men were all stunned in disbelief.Su Mo's rash attack before had made them both anxious and displeased.They thought that Su Mo was too impulsive.Now, they were both surprised and overjoyed to see that Su Mo used one move to defeat Jade-faced Playboy.Yang Zhixuan laid on the ground nearby, her eyes shining.\"Is this... sword will?\"Yang Zhixuan muttered to herself and then shook her head. \"It can't be!\"As the daughter of a Sky Yuan Sect elder, Yang Zhixuan knew what sword will looked like.Sword will was a type of martial will. It was a mystical entity, and only experts of the True Spirit Realm could fully understand it.In the history of Skymoon Country, there had never been a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm who understood sword will.Not to mention, Su Mo was only a martial artist of the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.Yang Zhixuan did not believe that was sword will. Perhaps, it was a special secret method that increased abilities!Su Mo's expression was cold, but his heart was beating fast with excitement.He had heavily injured Jade-faced Playboy with one blow.Sword will was indeed powerful, and it helped him to increase his abilities more than double.When he walked to the collapsed wall, Su Mo stared at Jade-faced Playboy, who was buried under the rubble.\"Get out! I know you're still alive!\"Su Mo shouted and scanned through the rubble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Beams of silvery rays hidden in the gallets were fiercely shooting at Su Mo.Meanwhile, Jade-faced Playboy lashed his body around and hastily ran far away.\"Can you escape while I'm here?\"Su Mo laughed coldly and lightly waved his splendid long sword, cutting all the silvery needles into pieces.Instantly, as he stabbed out, Su Mo's sharp sword ray broke through the air.With a sound of \"puff\", Jade-faced Playboy, who had just run several steps away, was stabbed through by Su Mo's sword and died immediately with a scream.Su Mo stepped forward to indifferently gaze at Jade-faced Playboy's corpse.Jade-faced Playboy was extremely powerful, but for cutting down one arm and hurting him before, Su Mo could not have killed him easily even had he used sword will.Looking at the corpse, brightness shined in Su Mo's eyes.How strong would the Blood Qi of a Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist be?Su Mo did not swallow the blood essence immediately. He packed the corpse into a separate storage pouch.Since there is no more breath after death, the corpse could be packed into the storage space like an item.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Four figures flew to the front of Su Mo from far away. They were Huang Houde and the other three.The four had just waited and watched the fight from a distance without joining it.They had planned to leave immediately if Su Mo was no match for Jade-faced Playboy. However, if Su Mo could match him, they would find ways to kill him together.Now, they were all surprised that Su Mo had in a moment killed Jade-faced Playboy by himself.\"Childe, we didn't expect you to be so strong. A martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm can kill a martial artist who's at Lv 3! Incredible!\"Huang Houde's face was full of horror.He could not help thinking secretly that even in Gale Island, this young man's talent was at a tiptop rank.\"Jade-faced Playboy has died. My mission was completed as well!\" said Su Mo flatly after he put Jade-faced Playboy's corpse away.\"Great thanks! May I ask Childe to stay several days more so I can express my sincere thanks to you?\" Huang Houde honestly asked.Su Mo shook his head and said, \"No need to thank me!\".In a minute, Su Mo moved to the lady in purple who was weakly lying on the ground.\"Are you OK? Can you stand up?\" Su Mo asked.Yang Zhixuan shook her head and faintly said, \"I... I'm totally powerless now.\"Su Mo thought for a while, and then immediately held Yang Zhixuan up by her waist.When Yang Zhixuan's warm and soft body came into Su Mo's arms, an elegant fragrance greeted him and wobbled his heart.\"Ah!\"Yang Zhixuan gracefully cried out with her beautiful pink cheek.\"Let me help you to get rid of the drug efficacy!\"Su Mo said and walked into Jade-faced Playboy's yard, holding Yang Zhixuan in arms.Huang Houde and the other three walked into the yard following Su Mo as well.An obscene and misted smell came from the room as they entered it.Two young ladies lay on the large bed madly twisting their bodies with pink faces and blurred eyes, eager to have sex.\"Childe, the two young ladies both ate aphrodisiacs!\" Huang Houde said to Su Mo after checking the two.Su Mo frowned and said, \"Master Huang, do a good deed thoroughly. Please help them get rid of the drug efficacy.\"\"OK!\" Huang Houde nodded and said.Su Mo put Yang Zhixuan on a chair, looked at her, and said, \"Wait for me a second.\"Yang Zhixuan blushed with shyness and imperceptibly nodded.Immediately, Su Mo left the room and walked to the yard avoiding Huang Houde and the other three.He began to swallow blood essence once he took Jade-faced Playboy's corpse out.He could not waste another minute in case Jade-faced Playboy's blood essence and blood Qi completely vanished.As a martial artist at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, Jade-faced Playboy's blood Qi was as vast as the Yangtse River running without end.Although Jade-faced Playboy lost lots of blood with one arm broken, the left blood essence in him still gave Su Mo a pleasant surprise.Unending blood essence was turned into blood Qi and ran into his body. Su Mo had to focus all his attention to refine it.The genuine Qi explosively increased in Su Mo's body as did his cultivation.His cultivation had been in the Early-stage at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.With the refinement of blood Qi, it upgraded to the Middle-stage at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, and then to the Late-stage at Lv 1.Finally, it reached its Peak at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo's cultivation stayed at the Peak Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm after he completely refined all the blood Qi. He could have upgraded his cultivation almost to Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.Bang!Having found Jade-faced Playboy's storage pouch, Su Mo restrained all his breaths, and then punched the corpse into a residue.When he returned to the room, Huang Houde and the other three backs removed the drug efficacy from the two young ladies.The low-grade aphrodisiacs were easy to remove.\"Childe, what should we do with that girl?\"Huang Houde looked at Yang Zhixuan and asked.\"I'll remove the drug efficacy of Atony Powder in Three Breaths for her. You can go back.\"Su Mo waved his hands and again refused Huang Houde's invitation.Huang Houde and the three left with the two young ladies.Only Su Mo and Yang Zhixuan stayed in the room.Yang Zhixuan tensed as she found the obscene and misted smell, watchfully glaring at Su Mo.\"Don't worry. I'll never force a woman to do the things she doesn't want to.\"Su Mo smiled when he noticed Yang Zhixuan's relaxed expression and then transferred genuine Qi into her body to remove the drug efficacy.Atony Powder in Three Breaths was an extremely potent drug with very strong efficacy that even a martial artist at Lv 5 or Lv 6 Spiritual Martial Realm could possibly not resist it if he took it.It took Su Mo four hours to remove drug efficacy in Yang Zhixuan.Four hours later, the efficacy of Atony Powder in Three Breaths was totally removed, and Yang Zhixuan's inner force gradually recovered.Huff!He felt relieved and stood up.Looking at Yang Zhixuan's beautiful face, Su Mo could not help thinking of Xi'er.It had been a long time since he separated from Xi'er. \"Has she awakened her Martial Soul? She might have awakened it already. What level of Martial Soul did she awaken?\" Su Mo thought.A moment later, Su Mo shook his head and said to Yang Zhixuan, \"Done, you're all right now!\"A grateful expression flashed in Yang Zhixuan's eyes. Nibbling her red lips, she said, \"Thank you for saving me. May I know Childe's name? I'll pay you back in the future.\"\"How will you pay me back? Marry me?\"Su Mo teased her.\"Om!\"Yang Zhixuan was embarrassed and blushed with shyness.\"Ha ha! Bye!\"Su Mo laughed, walked out of the room, and then departed.\"Childe, can we meet again?\"Chasing out of the room, Yang Zhixuan asked.\"We will meet if it's predestined.\"The light voice came from Su Mo.Staying still and bowing her head, Yang Zhixuan was lost in thought. Soon, her face creased in a knowing smile. She murmured, \"I'll find out who you are!\"Miles away from the Yellowstone City, it was Su Mo that rode away at a gallop on a wide and ancient road.Next, Bloody Blade Stockade, Sirius Mountain!\"What is in Jade-faced Playboy's storage pouch?\"Taking out the storage pouch, Su Mo checked it with his mind, but immediately, he fell disappointed.Jade-faced Playboy was a poor man. There were only ten thousand taels of gold, two scrolls, and three bottles of elixir in his storage pouch. The rest were useless sundries.Finding out that the three bottles of elixirs were aphrodisiacs, he crumbled all of them without hesitation.He did not need aphrodisiacs.For the two scrolls, one was a manual of cultivation method at Upper Lv 2, named \"Joint Joy Manual\".The other was a manual of martial arts techniques at Lower Lv 2, named \"Tianyin Twelve Skills\".The two manuals of cultivation method and martial arts techniques were the unique skills cultivated by Jade-faced Playboy.\"Joint Joy Manual\" was a mystical Dual Cultivation Method.\"If a man with sinister designs gets this cultivation method, he may do harm to countless young girls as Jade-faced Playboy did.\"Shaking his head, Su Mo took out the scroll named Joint Joy Manual and burned it into ashes with his flowing genuine Qi.\"What is it... ?\"Su Mo moved his mind, and then a tortoise shell of a palm-size appeared in his hand.Staring, it was thickly covered with small characters. Even Su Mo could not recognize them quite clearly.Thinking for a while, Su Mo put genuine Qi into the tortoise shell. The characters were hung in the air and amplified before him.\"Nine Spirals Mystique!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Spiritual Spiral was a vortex of liquid Genuine Qi in the elixir field of a martial artist in the Spiritual Martial Realm.It was condensed from the strong Congenital Genuine Qi and was the foundation of a Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.Usually, there was only one Spiritual Spiral in a martial artist's body.However, according to Nine Spirals Mystique, a martial artist could condense another eight Spiritual Spirals. Thus, he could have eight or nine times more power than before.This secret method could only be practiced when one was in the Spiritual Martial Realm, but it was not limited by the cultivation method levels. One could practice any cultivation method to make the Spiritual Spirals.\"I'm so lucky! It's actually a secret method!\"Su Mo was very happy.A secret method was not a cultivation method nor a martial arts technique, and it was extremely rare. It was said that every secret method had an incredible function.The function of this secret method provided a way to help martial artists condense more Spiritual Spirals.However, according to Nine Spirals Mystique, it was really hard to condense nine Spiritual Spirals.It was quite hard for an ordinary martial artist to even condense the second Spiritual Spiral, and only a martial artist with a high talent and a strong body constitution could condense the third Spiritual Spiral.Condensing the fourth or the fifth Spiritual Spiral was several times, or dozens of times, harder than condensing the third Spiritual Spiral.There would be thousands of difficulties to condense the ninth Spiritual Spiral.\"No wonder Jade-faced Playboy still was so powerful even when he was seriously injured\u2014it seems that he had practiced Nine Spirals Mystique!\"There was a colorful light in Su Mo's eyes as he said in his heart, \"However, I guess he must have only condensed two Spiritual Spirals, otherwise, even if I had sword will, I still would not have been his match.\"Su Mo packed up the tortoiseshell, got on the horse, and was going to find a place to study it.Soon after, Su Mo came to an unknown town.He booked an upper room in an inn and stayed there.In the room, Su Mo took out the tortoiseshell, then carefully studied Nine Spirals Mystique, trying to remember its key points.After a long time, Su Mo sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to practice Nine Spirals Mystique.In the elixir field, Su Mo's Spiritual Spiral was enveloped by an invisible force, slightly quivering.As time went by, the frequency of the quivering Spiritual Spiral went faster and faster.The Spiritual Spiral was slowly pulled to both sides. There was a tendency to divide it into two.Suddenly, an incomparably strong fluctuation of Genuine Qi erupted from Su Mo's two Spiritual Spirals, impacting his entire body.\"Er!\"Su Mo uttered a groan. Even with his strong body, he still felt a burst of pain.He took a deep breath and was very cautious, knowing that if it went wrong, he would stop at once.If he could not practice the second Spiritual Spiral, but instead, destroyed his first Spiritual Spiral, he would lose more than he gained.Time was passing second by second and Su Mo's cheeks were covered in sweat, but his eyes appeared pleasantly surprised.His Spiritual Spiral had been gradually separated\u2014two Spiritual Spirals were now rotating respectively, and only partially connected together.Once they were completely separated, he would succeed.As Su Mo's heart was beating quickly, he continued to practice the secret method, and finally, the two Spiritual Spirals were completely separated.Boom!The moment that the two Spiritual Spirals were separated, two strands of strong Genuine Qi echoed off of each other. The surging momentum rushed out from Su Mo's body and smashed all the desks and chairs in the room into pieces.After a little while, Su Mo had completely controlled the power in his body, and then he opened his eyes, which were completely filled with joy.The second Spiritual Spiral had been made!At this time, his two Spiritual Spirals were self-contained. Each Spiritual Spiral was the same as before, except that the shape was smaller and the Genuine Qi was weaker.As long as a full recovery was made, he could fill his two Spiritual Spirals with Genuine Qi, and then he would have double the power.\"It wasn't easy to condense the second Spiritual Spiral, thus, it'll be even harder to condense the third Spiritual Spiral!\" Su Mo thought in his heart.However, the most difficult part of condensing Spiritual Spirals was bearing the strong pressure of the Genuine Qi impacting his body.However, as long as his body was strong enough, there would not much difficulty in condensing the Spiritual Spirals.Su Mo had spent all his time recently on improving his cultivation and practicing martial arts techniques, and the power of his body had not improved for a long time.He had successfully practiced the Lv 3 of Elephant's Strength Skill, and now it was time to practice the Lv 4.The first three levels of Elephant's Strength Skill were mainly to strengthen the skin and flesh and to enhance physical strength.From the Lv 4 to the Lv 6, he would be taught how to strengthen his muscles and bones. Once that was done, not only would his physical strength be improved countless times over, but his body would also be hard enough to block weapons.This Body Refining Skill was rather magical as its promotions almost had no bottlenecks. As long as he could absorb enough Spiritual Qi, he could successfully practice.Su Mo released his Rank 8 Human Class Devouring Martial Spirit, and an incomparable power erupted out of it to devour the Spiritual Qi. After Genuine Qi filled the two Spiritual Spirals, he began to practice the Lv 4 of the Elephant's Strength Skill.This time, when the Spiritual Qi entered Su Mo's body, it no longer turned into elephant runes but turned into small virtual shadows of the elephants. Numerous small elephants were screaming, and they drilled into Su Mo's body and then disappeared.The strength of Su Mo's body was slowly increasing.Su Mo stayed in the inn for three days before setting off again.Every mission had its time limit, and besides, he was far away from Sirius Mountain. If he was not able to meet the deadline, even if he finished the mission, there would be no contribution points.Su Mo urged the horse to run quickly, and eight days later, he came to the foot of Sirius Mountain.The Bloody Blade Stockade was located on Sirius Mountain.Because of the Bloody Blade Stockade, there were no villages, towns, or people\u2014nothing but dead silence in the 50 km radius around Sirius Mountain.Su Mo got down from the horse and went up the mountain.He now had two Spiritual Spirals, so he had double power. Even if the chief of brigands was at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, plus several martial artists at Lv 1 or Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, he would not be afraid of the Bloody Blade Stockade.In a short time, Su Mo arrived at the mountainside, and a huge stockade appeared in his vision.It was a large stockade with hundreds of houses, and there was a wall a few meters high built with huge stones outside the stockade.A flag was fluttering in the wind over the stockade's gate, and there was a bloody war saber drawn on the flag.Eight bandits were chatting while their long saber hung on their waists.\"This time, Protector Tan personally led our brothers to steal, and they've had a rich harvest!\"\"Yes! They brought back more than 50 women, not to mention the treasures!\"\"Ah! They're sharing the treasures and enjoying the women, but we have to stay here and guard the gate. Damn it, when can I leave to enjoy myself?\" A man with pockmarks on his face complained.\"You? Zhang Mazi, you're so weak that you can only guard the gate!\" Another man laughed at him.\"Humph! F*ck, if I could have often gone down the mountain to steal some money, then I would have broken through in my cultivation and I wouldn't have been trapped at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm for such a long time...\"Zhang Mazi was still complaining, but before he finished, he suddenly paused and looked in the distance.The others did not know why, so they also looked in the same direction.They saw a boy in a white robe walking at a steady pace toward the stockade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe young man in the white robe seemed to walk very slowly, but he was actually very fast.In the blink of an eye, he had reached the gate of the fortress.\"Who are you?\" Zhang Mazi yelled when they came to their senses.Whoosh!The answer was a striking sword radiance, which killed all of them in a flash.Su Mo coldly disregarded them, smashed the gate with a single blow, and walked into the fortress.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Suddenly, hundreds of bandits heard him and rushed out of the fortress, tightly surrounding Su Mo.\"Who are you to dare to break into Bloody Blade Stockade?\"\"Boy, you're courting death!\"\"Kill him!\"\"...\"All of the bandits roared in anger and rushed towards Su Mo.\"Die!\"Su Mo shouted violently as the hundreds of bandits attacked him. He swung his long sword, and sword Qi swept through the crowd.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Every strike of the sword tore up dozens of bodies, and endless blood spewed like rain. A large number of bandits were decapitated, and their severed limbs were flying everywhere.In the span of only a dozen breaths, two to three hundred bandits were slaughtered mercilessly.Although there were so many bandits, they were no match for Su Mo.This was a blatant slaughtering because the two sides were on completely different levels.\"What? How could he have such terrifying abilities?\"The remaining bandits were all shocked.\"Hurry and notify the chief of brigands!\" yelled a bandit, and someone rushed into the fortress.Su Mo disregarded this and stepped inside. With every swing of his sword, he killed a man, spewing blood everywhere.In a short amount of time, hundreds of bandits were almost all killed by him, and there were only a few left to scramble around.Blood stained the ground red and converged into rivers that flowed far away.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!In the distance, a dozen men rushed out.They were led by a menacing middle-aged man with a chin full of scruff and a strong body.It was the chief of brigands of Bloody Blade Stockade, Blood Blade!The remaining men were mostly at the Spiritual Martial Realm, and even the ones with the lowest cultivation had a half step to the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Boy, no matter who you are, now that you dare to kill in my Bloody Blade Stockade, you'll certainly die.\" Blood Blade roared in anger, seemingly popping out his eyes, after he came closer and saw the rivers of blood.\"After today, Bloody Blade Stockade will cease to exist!\" Su Mo indifferently said.\"How bold. You better take a good look at yourself before trying to wipe out my Bloody Blade Stockade.\"A sinister-looking deputy chief of brigands next to Blood Blade smiled coldly and said, \"Chief of brigands, you don't have to do anything. Let me take care of him!\"Blood Blade nodded and said, \"Be careful, Hu!\"Deputy chief of brigands Hu smiled disdainfully and said, \"He's only at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, so how powerful could he be?\"Deputy chief of brigands Hu had a cultivation of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm and was incredibly powerful. A martial artist at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm was nothing in his eyes.Afterwards, Hu flew forward, and a black war saber appeared in his hand. He swung the sword down on Su Mo's head with a force that could split a mountain.The dark sword light was cold, terrifying and menacing.Deputy chief of brigands Hu smiled cruelly.In the next moment, his smile froze.A beam of white light flashed past him like lightning, and it cut him in half from his waist, spilling his guts all over the floor.\"Ah!\"Deputy chief of brigands Hu could only scream once before dying.\"What?\"Everyone was shocked. Deputy chief of brigands Hu was at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, but he was defeated in one strike.\"Who is this young man? How could he be so terrifying?\"Blood Blade frowned and yelled coldly, \"Everyone attacks him together!\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!A dozen Bloody Blade Stockade officials rushed towards Su Mo with their swords.Blood Blade was in the lead, carrying a giant blood-red sword that glinted in the light.\"Bloody Cloud Cut!\"The bloody Sword Qi was like a red cloud that tore through the air and was unstoppable.\"Die! Die! Die!\"Su Mo was also in a killing rage. The two genuine Qi Spiritual Spirals in his body spun crazily, and the sword will shot out into the sky.\"Sword Essence of Wind Devil!\"\"Separating Remnant Clouds!\"\"Wind Roaring in the Sky!\"Su Mo consecutively made three attacks and stopped to stand quietly on the spot.At this moment, not one of his enemies was still standing.The entire Bloody Blade Stockade had been killed by him.Half of Blood Blade's body was hacked onto the ground, but he was still hanging onto his life by a thread, with fear in his eyes.Looking at the blood flowing in streams on the ground and countless dismembered limbs,\u00a0Su Mo took a deep breath and roared, \"Devour!\"Boom!Devouring Martial Spirit was released, and shapeless devouring force spread everywhere. Endless blood flowed into rivers and flooded over Su Mo.After a while, the blood was all gone, and Su Mo's body was revealed.The endless blood rivers made his cultivation enter into Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.It even reached the late stage of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.Although there was a large amount of blood essence, most of it belonged to martial artists in the Qi cultivation realm and was not useful. Only a few people's Blood Qi was strong enough.Then, Su Mo collected the storage pouches of Blood Blade and other Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists, and he swept through the fortress once more.Afterwards, he left the mountain.A lot of women and slaves were imprisoned in the Bloody Blade Stockade, and Su Mo released them all.When he got to the bottom of the mountain, Su Mo looked into the distance towards Sunnywood City.Sirius Mountain was less 500 kilometers away from Sunnywood City.Su Mo could return there right now, but he dismissed this thought with a shake of his head.\"I'll return when I'm powerful enough!\"\"Then, I'll wipe out the Wei family first.\"Su Mo whipped his horse to go quickly towards his next stop.Su Mo had accepted three missions at a time, and he had completed the first two efficiently.However, the last one might take a while.Since the last mission was not to kill someone but to serve as an escort, it naturally would take some time.The Ji family was a small family in Maple Leaf City. There were a couple of martial artists of Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, and the Master, Ji Long, was an expert at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.However, when Ji Long was recently hunting Demonic Beasts, he was injured by a Class 3 Lv 2 Three-colored Poisonous Spider. The poison had been absorbed into all his organs, and he would die soon if there was not a timely cure for him.However, the poison of the Three-colored Poisonous Spider was extremely strong, and Ji Long's poison had sunk in too deep, so common elixir would not cure Ji Long.The Ji family begged to hire a Master of refining pills, but the cure he needed to develop lacked an ingredient.This ingredient was Blue Black Flower Seed, the seed of the Spiritual Herb Blue Black Flower.The Blue Black Flower was very rare, and its seeds were even rarer. The Ji family searched all over until they heard that the leader of the Doublehawks Faction in Blackhill City had the seeds.Thus, they planned to go to Blackhill city to purchase the seeds from Doublehawks Faction.However, Blackhill City was a very tumultuous city without a city governor to maintain or the Skymoon Country army to protect, and it was filled with ruthless villains.Also, the so-called \"Doublehawks Faction\" used to be a group of bandits who would break into homes and murder civilians.If the Ji family did not have strong protection on the way to Blackhill City, they would be walking into the belly of the beast.Therefore, the Ji family announced missions in the four sects to hire four disciples as protection.The disciples of the four sects were much stronger than regular unaffiliated martial artists, and the reputation of the four sects was already enough to terrify some.With their protection, traveling to Blackhill City would be extremely safe.At this moment, in the Ji family hall, a young woman who was around 25 years old was sitting in the main throne. She was extremely beautiful, with soft white skin and a mysterious air. She wore a pink dress over her slim figure, and her long black hair draped past her waist.She was the eldest daughter of the Ji family, Ji Shuirou.Below her sat three dashing young men.\"Ha ha, welcome to the Ji family. I'd like to thank you all on behalf of the Ji family,\" Ji Shuirou said with a soft voice and quiet chuckle.She stood up to bow to the three men.\"Miss Ji, it's my mission, so you don't have to thank me. As long as I'm here, you'll be safe and sound,\" said a stocky young man who was called He Qian proudly.\"Yes, with our protection, you have no need to worry.\"The other two men were just as confident.These three young men were from the Sky Rapier Sect, the Scorching Sun Sect, and the Sky Yuan Sect.They were all prodigies with cultivations of Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.The stocky young man was especially outstanding, with a giant black sword on his back and sword Qi swirling around him.He was a disciple of the top sect, the Sky Yuan sect.\"Miss Ji, your father is deeply injured and has no time to lose, so let's set out now!\" said He Qian.\"Let's wait a little longer. I hired one person from each of the four sects, and the disciple from Gale Island is not here yet,\" Ji Shuirou said with an apologetical smile, after pondering for a while.\"Ha ha! The disciples of Gale Island are rather useless and he won't make a difference even if he comes, so why waste our time?\" asked a young man with narrow eyes, a disciple from the Scorching Sun sect.\"You're right!\" said the Sky Yuan Sect disciple with a nod. \"If no one from Gale Island accepted this mission, would Miss Ji wait forever?\"Gale Island was perhaps the richest of the four sects, but its comprehensive strength was definitely the weakest.The Gale Island disciples were much less powerful than the other sects.The only person who elevated Gale Island's reputation in the last few years was Duan Jingtian.Besides him, the other disciples were no match against the other sects.Ji Shuirou listened to the two men's advice, thought for a while, and nodded.Her father's life was at stake, and she did not want to waste time.\"No need to wait, I've arrived!\"Suddenly, a loud voice echoed from outside the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Miss Ji, please forgive me for being late!\"Su Mo walked into the hall and clasped his hand in greeting towards Ji Shuirou.\"Haha, you're not late. Since everyone is here, let's get ready to leave.\"Ji Shuirou smiled, stood up, and said to the four men, \"Please wait for a moment as I prepare.\"Then, Ji Shuirou sashayed out of the hall.Su Mo found a spot in the hall to sit down.\"Humf! It doesn't even matter that you came. With your cultivation of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, you're just here for a show!\" said a shrill voice in Su Mo's ear.The voice belonged to a young man with long thin eyes.This man was called Song Yang, and he was a disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect.Su Mo frowned, looked at him, and said coldly, \"That's an unnecessary thing to say! Be careful, disaster emanates from careless talk!\"\"Disaster emanates from careless talk? Ha ha!\"Song Yang laughed loudly and said, \"How dare a nobody from Gale Island speak so recklessly? Don't you think I can take you off of this mission?\"\"Take me off?\" asked Su Mo in surprise. \"Can you speak for the Ji family?\"He had accepted the Ji family's mission, but if someone wanted him to give up the mission, it must be the Ji family.This is why Su Mo asked.\"Ha ha!\" Song Yang chuckled and said mockingly, \"If you're heavily injured, you won't be able to join this mission!\"\"Heavily injured?\" Su Mo narrowed his eyes in realization, and he shook his head and said, \"There will always be narrow-minded people in this world who have no regard for anyone else and are full of themselves, how sad!\"\"Boy, you really have got some nerve!\" shouted Song Yang furiously.He stood up and shouted, with all of his Qi emanating from his body, \"How dare a failure of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm to be so rude! You must be tired of living!\"He Qian and another disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect watched their fighting with great interest.\"Boy, do you know who you're talking to?\" asked the Sky Yuan sect disciple mockingly, \"His name is Song Yang. He's the genius disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect and has completed fifteen sect missions in a year. He's famous in Skymoon country, known as \"Fierce Cloud Hand\". Even I, Dong Yue, am not his opponent. You better pray for luck if you're up against him!\"The Sky Yuan sect disciple Dong Yue was smiling gleefully.Hearing this, Song Yang smiled haughtily.\"Trash, listen here! Do you want to drop out of the mission voluntarily, or do you need me to force you?\" Song Yang said proudly as he looked down upon Su Mo.He had not planned on kicking Su Mo off the mission, but Su Mo's intentional rudeness made him very displeased.Su Mo glanced at Song Yang, who was full of pride and asked coldly, \"Did you just call me trash?\"\"Yeah! You only have a cultivation of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, aren't you trash?\" Song Yang said disdainfully.Su Mo stood up, glared at Song Yang coldly, and said, \"Since that's the case, then take my trash strike. If you don't die, I'll spare your life.\"Just after Su Mo spoke those words, Song Yang was shocked!The Sky Rapier Sect disciple He Qian and the Sky Yuan Sect disciple Dong Yue were also stunned.\"Is this guy crazy?\"\"Or is he just ignorant?\"\"How dare he speak so rudely about striking Song Yang and sparing his life?\"\"Ha ha ha...\"After he regained his senses, Song Yang burst into laughter, and said, \"Boy, I misread you. You're not crazy, you're simply stupid! Not to mention one strike, even with one hundred strikes, one thousand strikes, I'll still be standing!\"Song Yang roared with laughter. He was very confident because he was the genius disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect and was strongly favored in his sect. Besides, his cultivation method was Medium Lv 2, and his martial arts techniques were also Medium Lv 2 and had already been cultivated to the peak of the Minor Completion.In the vast Scorching Sun Sect, there were no more than 10 people in his level who could defeat him.Now, a disciple of Gale Island whose cultivation was a level lower than his dared to say that he was going to spare his life if he survived one strike.How could he not laugh?Looking at his opponent laugh disdainfully, Su Mo smiled playfully, and said, \"I'm going to strike!\"Clang!With a sword sound, a stream of bright sword radiance shot out.The sword radiance was as swift and traceless as the wind, broke through space with threatening momentum, and shot towards Song Yang.\"What?\"Feeling the power of Su Mo's sword, Song Yang immediately stopped laughing and widened his eyes in shock.His face was overtaken by endless fear.The sword force was extremely fast, which made all the hairs on his body stand on end, and a sense of extreme terror arose in his heart.Dong Yue stood up in shock.He Qian also stood up. He specialized in swordsmanship, so he knew that how powerful this movement was when he saw it at a glance.Roar!Faced with such a strong sword, Song Yang had no time to think and swung his palm towards the sword radiance with a roar.\"Fierce Cloud Hand!\"Song Yang's palm immediately turned into a soldering iron that was bright red and gave off a frighteningly high temperature that could melt metal.Then, the palm and sword radiance collided.Boom!With a startling sound, the strong force of the impact spread out from Su Mo and Song Yang, and it blasted all the tables and chairs in the hall into dust.Suddenly, a figure shot out from the center of the impact with the speed of a rocket and crashed into the wall of the hall.Boom!The wall collapsed into a pile of rubble, and the figure was buried under the pile, barely stirring.Everyone present was completely silent.He Qian and Dong Yue stared with wide eyes at this scene.The loser was Song Yang.He actually could not even take a single strike!The two men could not help but think of Su Mo's previous words. Song Yang's disaster really emanates from his careless talk.If he had not provoked Su Mo, he would not have met this consequence.After defeating Song Yang with one strike, Su Mo did not give him another glance and sat down cross-legged on the ground.Just as he had said, even if his opponent did not die, he would not attack again.All the chairs in the hall had been shattered, and there was nowhere to sit, so Su Mo could only sit on the ground.Gulp!After a while, Dong Yue swallowed a gulp of saliva and looked at the calm Su Mo, and his expression instantly changed.Soon, Dong Yue smiled in an embarrassed way and said, \"Brother, I did not expect you to be so powerful. Song Yang should have been punished for provoking you, and if he died he would have deserved it!\"Dong Yue's tone was groveling as if he had forgotten he also disdained Su Mo before.Dong Yue was a disciple of the Sky Yuan Sect and had no ties to Song Yang, so he did not mind if he lived or died.Su Mo was too lazy to talk to a two-faced person like Dong Yue.He Qian did not say anything and instead examined Su Mo with narrowed eyes, secretly sizing up his abilities.Song Yang's defense had been a little rushed, so he did not have time to use his full power.So if He Qian himself had attacked, he was able to heavily injure Song Yang with one strike as well.Although he was also at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, he had already reached the peak of this Level, and his combat force was much stronger than Song Yang's.He concluded that if he were to fight Su Mo, the chances of winning would probably be 50%.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Shuirou led several martial artists of the Ji clan inside.Seeing the mess in the hall, Ji Shuirou felt puzzled and asked in surprise, \"What's going on?\"The next moment, she found that only three men were in the hall, while Song Yang was gone. She asked the others, \"Where's Mr. Song?\"Su Mo did not answer, and He Qian and Dong Yue opened and then shut their mouths while looking at the collapsed wall.Looking at their eyes, Ji Shuirou was in a daze and felt very confused.Two martial artists of the Ji clan stepped forward to the collapsed wall, had a look, and suddenly cried, \"Miss, someone is under the broken wall!\"\"What?\"Ji Shuirou was startled and walked forward. Then, several martial artists of the Ji clan moved the rubble away, and a figure revealed itself. It was Song Yang!Blood flowed from all the seven openings of his head, and Song Yang had no breath of life.He was dead!Ji Shuirou frowned. A disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect had just died while in her clan. If she was not able to properly handle it, her clan might be destroyed.\"Guys, what the hell's going on?\"As Ji Shuirou asked the three men, her face was livid.There were only four of them here, so the death of Song Yang certainly was related to these other three.However, Ji Shuirou did not dare to call them to account. No matter what, their power and backgrounds were far above the Ji clan's.Ji Shuirou looked at He Qian because, among the three of them, only He Qian was able to easily kill Song Yang.\"Miss Ji, I killed Song Yang!\"Su Mo said in a flat voice, \"He provoked me, so I killed him. This matter has nothing to do with your clan, and if anyone questions it, you can tell them the truth.\"Ji Shuirou was astonished by Su Mo's words, because she knew that Su Mo's cultivation was only at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo's cultivation was the lowest among them, but he just said that he had killed Song Yang!Were his abilities the same as He Qian's? Or even more powerful?Ji Shuirou went silent, as did the other two. Apparently, what Su Mo said was true.After a long time, Ji Shuirou sighed and made a forced smile. \"Guys, since Song Yang has died, I'll rely on you to finish the mission!\"Ji Shuirou was helpless with Su Mo, but Su Mo's strong abilities were beneficial to her because they would make them safer.\"Miss Ji, you're welcome!\" they replied.Ji Shuirou commanded her servants to dispose of Song Yang's body and said to Su Mo and the other two, \"Guys, let's go!\"At the western city gate of Maple Leaf City, 10 people riding cyan-maned horses rushed out of the city gate and galloped toward Blackhill City.They were: Su Mo, He Qian, Dong Yue, Ji Shuirou, and six martial artists of the Ji clan.The six martial artists were all at Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, as was Ji Shuirou.Blackhill City was near the border of Skymoon Country and was 2,000 kilometers away from Maple Leaf City. Even if the cyan-maned horses were good at running, it still would take at least four or five days for them to get there.\"Mr. Su, you're so powerful at such a young age, so you must be the genius disciple in Gale Island,\" Jiu Shuirou said to Su Mo every now and then on the way.She was interested in Su Mo. He was at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, but he was able to kill a martial artist at Lv 3, which was very rare, even among the Four Sects.So she was willing to make overtures to him.\"Haha! Genius is an exaggeration for me!\"Su Mo smiled, shrugging.\"Mr. Su, you're too modest. With such a talent, you'll definitely be well-known in Skymoon Country!\"Ji Shuirou asserted with shining eyes.\"Well, I hope so!\"Su Mo smiled without any pride on his face.Being well-known in Skymoon Country?Did he only have this ambition?No!His ambition was to move forward and stand on the top of this continent and completely take control of his own destiny.He remembered that there was a famous saying in his first life: when waking up, take control of the world; and when drunk, lay on a beauty's legs.That was Su Mo's goal.They marched quickly. In just over two days, they had traveled more than 1,000 kilometers.On this evening, it was getting dark, so they stopped in a city along the way.They booked several upper rooms in an inn, then ordered some food and wine and sat in the lobby, eating and chatting.\"Guys, if there are no accidents, we'll arrive in Blackhill City in two days before noon,\" said Ji Shuirou after she poured liquor for the three men while they were all sitting at the table.\"Miss Ji, don't worry! With the three of us as escorts, no one will dare to rob you in Blackhill City!\" Dong Yue said with a smile.Hearing that, Ji Shuirou gave a little chuckle and said, \"That's great!\"\"Miss Ji, the Blue Black Flower Seed is in the Doublehawks Faction. If they do not want to give it to you, what will you do?\" asked Su Mo, drinking a mouthful of liquor.\"Er...!\"Ji Shuirou was silent for a moment, and then she said, \"That's exactly what I'm worried about! However, if I double the price, they will probably sell it to me.\"Su Mo shook his head. \"If the Blue Black Flower Seed is of great use to them, even if you offer two times or even three times the price, they would not necessarily sell it.\"\"Miss Ji, no need to worry!\"He Qian sneered and said, \"If the Doublehawks Faction doesn't want to sell the Blue Black Flower Seed, I'll destroy them for you. Anyway, the Doublehawks Faction has done all kinds of evil, so destroying them would also be a good thing for the people.\"\"Mr. He, never do that!\"Ji Shuirou said in shock, \"It's said that the two leaders of the Doublehawks Faction, Goshawk and Vulture, are both at the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, and they're good at joint combat. They're able to jointly withstand 10 moves from a martial artist of Lv 4 without being defeated. Besides, they have many followers. There are dozens of martial artists at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm among them. It's not a good idea to have a conflict with them.\"\"Oh, withstand 10 moves from a martial artist of Lv 4 without being defeated?\"He Qian shook his head and did not care at all, saying, \"The martial artist at Lv 4 that they fought must have been the weakest one. If they fight with a Lv 4 martial artist of the Sky Rapier Sect, they'll be defeated within five moves.\"Ji Shuirou wryly smiled. She did not want to debate with him.She knew that the disciples of the Four Sects were inevitably arrogant and looked down upon the other martial artists.She only hoped that He Qian would not be reckless and mess things up.They ate and chatted. Just at that moment, a large group of martial artists came into the inn. As they entered, they were chatting and looking excited.\"It's amazing! Duan Jingtian, the big Core Disciple of Gale Island, will have a battle with Jin Yang, the big Core Disciple of the Scorching Sun Sect on the top of Yu Mountain!\"\"Each of the four talents of Skymoon Country has an Earth Class Martial Soul. They're called the peerless geniuses. The battle between them is so exciting!\"\"Who do you think will win? Duan Jingtian or Jin Yang?\" someone curiously asked.\"It's hard to say. It's said that their abilities are almost at the same level. I'm afraid it'll be a difficult fight!\"\"Actually, when it comes to talent, I prefer Duan Jingtian.\"\"Why?\" The others were curious.\"Do I have to explain why? The other three elitists are all close to 25 years old, but Duan Jingtian is only 22. You can see whose talent is the best with just a glance!\"The others understood.Hearing the words of those men, Su Mo and the others were surprised.Did Duan Jingtian challenge Jin Yang?A battle between two talents of Skymoon Country?Su Mo's eyes flashed with a bright light.Duan Jingtian?The pride of Gale Island?He really wanted to see the battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is Duan Jingtian really going to challenge Jin Yang?\" an obese young man stepped forward and asked.\"Of course. I guess this news has now spread throughout Skymoon Country!\"\"When will they fight?\" asked another man.\"In five days, on the top of Yu Mountain. A lot of people have already rushed over there. We're also going to Yu Mountain.\"One of them said with a smile, \"Brother, if you want to go, you'd better prepare early so you don't miss this outstanding battle!\"\"...\"The news was so sensational that, once it came out, all the people in the inn began to discuss it.Duan Jingtian and Jin Yang were both dazzling, top talents in Skymoon Country.Their fight excited many people.\"I really didn't expect Duan Jingtian to have a battle with Jinyang. When we finish this mission, I'll go to Yu Mountain.\"Dong Yue asked Su Mo and He Qian with a smile, \"Guys, will you come with me then?\"\"Yes!\"He Qian nodded and said, \"It's rare to see such a battle. I won't miss it.\"\"Brother Su, what about you?\" Dong Yue looked at Su Mo.Su Mo nodded after thinking for a while.After finishing the mission, he would return to Gale Island, and Yu Mountain was on the way back to the island, so he would naturally go and have a look.\"It's enviable that you can go and watch that great battle!\"Ji Shuirou sighed and said, \"I can't go. My father's life is in dire danger, so how will I have time to go to Yu Mountain?\"\"Well, please don't be disappointed, Miss Ji. Curing your father is the most important thing!\" Dong Yue said with a smile.After dinner, they returned to their own rooms.In the room, Su Mo sat cross-legged on his bed, pondering Nine Spirals Mystique.After a long time, he closed his eyes and began to practice it.He was ready to condense the third Spiritual Spiral. Once he succeeded, he would be able to have triple power.In Su Mo's elixir field, one Spiritual Spiral was swiftly rotating and slowly trembling at the same time.Time was passing gradually, and Su Mo's cheeks were covered with sweat.He looked very grave and seemed to be in pain.In his elixir field, his third Spiritual Spiral reached the most crucial moment of condensing.The moment that his third Spiritual Spiral had just formed, an unparalleled force exploded from Su Mo's elixir field, impacting his whole body.He could not help but tremble from the tearing pain in his flesh, meridians, and bones.There were even wisps of blood mist arising from his pores.Condensing the third Spiritual Spiral was several times harder than condensing the second one.Even with such a strong body, it was almost unbearable for Su Mo.\"F*ck! I don't believe it. This is just to condense the third Spiritual Spiral. Am I not able to do it?\"Su Mo made up his mind and clenched his teeth, striving to make it.He bore all of the pressure and did not leak even a little.Otherwise, the whole room might be shattered by him.Eventually, two hours later, his third Spiritual Spiral was thoroughly condensed.Boom!Three Spiritual Spirals formed an equilateral triangle in Su Mo's elixir field, echoing off of each other and having an imposing momentum.Massive and powerful Congenital Genuine Qi exploded out, forming rolling waves.\"Huff!\"Su Mo opened his eyes and exhaled a mouthful of foul air.\"The tripled power from my three Spiritual Spirals, coupled with my Lv 3 cultivation methods and martial arts techniques, will probably make me as strong as a normal Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.\"Su Mo smiled.\"However, three Spiritual Spiral is already my limit. I'm afraid it's impossible to condense another Spiritual Spiral in a short time!\"Su Mo thought, \"Only after significantly improving the power of my physical body will I be able to condense the fourth Spiritual Spiral.\"After a long time, Su Mo calmed down, released his Devouring Martial Spirit to absorb the Spiritual Qi, and began to practice Elephant's Strength Skill.After a wordless night, the team set out at dawn the next day....Blackhill City was located on the northwest border of Skymoon Country.Just like its name, the dark and towering city wall stood like dark mountains.There was a mixed crowd in Blackhill City\u2014villains, roving bandits, and ruthless thieves all lived there.There were hundreds of different sizes of organizations in the city. Fights and battles were very common and the city was very chaotic.\"Yu! Yu!\"The war horses were neighing. At noon, they finally arrived in Blackhill City.Stepping into Blackhill City, Su Mo could obviously feel a cold and ruthless aura. The martial artists on the street were looking at them antagonistically with a bright light in their eyes.However, they were all in the Spiritual Martial Realm, and their powerful momentum deterred those men.So no one was foolish enough to provoke them.\"The Doublehawks Faction is in the north part of the city. Let's go,\" said Ji Shuirou.After a moment, they arrived at the Doublehawks Faction's station.The Doublehawks Faction was located in a vast mansion. In front of the gate, there were two lifelike stone eagles as tall as two men.\"Who are you?\"In front of the door, several Doublehawks Faction members shouted at them with livid faces.\"We're going to meet your master! You need to inform him quickly!\" Dong Yue said in an arrogant voice.\"Hold on! I'll go and report this.\"Seeing that they were powerful and of a dignified bearing, one gatekeeper hurriedly went to report it.Not too long after, he came back.\"Our second master welcomes you all. Please follow me.\"They followed him into the mansion and went into the living room.A middle-aged man in a gray robe was there. He was completely bald and had a shining head.His gloomy face and his aquiline nose suggested that he was a cruel and cold-hearted man.\"I'm Vulture. How can our Doublehawks Faction help you?\"Vulture said in a hoarse voice, looking at Su Mo and the others.A member had just reported that several powerful martial artists in the Spiritual Martial Realm had asked to see him, which puzzled him.\"I'm Ji Shuirou. Nice to meet you, Master Vulture.\"Ji Shuirou and the martial artists of the Ji clan bowed to Vulture.The moment Vulture saw Ji Shuirou, his eyes flashed with a hint of lust. He said, \"No one comes to the Hall of Trinity without a reason. How can I help you?\"Ji Shuirou said without beating around the bush, \"I heard that your faction has the Blue Black Flower Seed, so I want to buy it. Would you like to sell it?\"\"Oh, the Blue Black Flower Seed?\"Vulture was surprised, but then he sneered and said, \"Miss Ji is well-informed. We do have the seed, but it is of great use to me, so I won't sell. Please go back!\"Ji Shuirou was shocked and hurriedly said, \"Master Vulture, I'm willing to double the price. Please!\"\"I've said I won't sell it! Please leave!\"Vulture's face turned cold. He seemed quite impatient.Ji Shuirou's body was twitching, she was in a panic.If she could not get the seed, her father would die without a doubt.\"Hmpf! Master Vulture, you really have an imposing manner!\"He Qian said with a sneer, \"I'm a disciple of the Sky Rapier Sect. Would you like to give up the seed out of respect for my sect?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Our presence should be an honor, so you'd better know how to appreciate favors!\"Dong Yue chuckled. His words were full of threats.\"Disciples of three Sects?\"Hearing that, Vulture looked at the three men up and down with a cold light in his eyes.Su Mo did not say anything, but he sighed in his heart. The two men were really supercilious. As soon as the request was refused, they carried out a threat at the next moment.Ji Shuirou's face changed. She disapproved of what the two men were doing, but if their identities could force Vulture to sell the seed, then that would be a good thing for her.\"Master Vulture, I really need the seed to save my father, so if Master Vulture can sell it to me, I'd appreciate that!\" Ji Shuirui said, apologizing with a smile.Vulture, with his eyes flashing, did not verify their identities. He wrinkled his brows in concentration and, after a while, said with a smile, \"Since the Blue Black Flower Seed is so important to you, I'll aid you by selling the seed.\"\"Really?\"Ji Shuirou was overjoyed upon hearing that. She hurried to bow to Vulture and said, \"That's great, thank you so much.\"\"You're welcome!\"Vulture waved his hand and said, \"However, you said you're willing to pay double. The Blue Black Flower Seed's market price is 40,000 taels of gold, so you should give me 80,000 taels of gold.\"\"Of course. I won't break my promise.\" Ji Shuirou nodded.Vulture took out a corn-sized yellow seed from his storage pouch.Ji Shuirou paid 80,000 taels of gold to Vulture and got the seed.\"Thank you very much. I bid you adieu!\"Ji Shuirou bowed to Vulture.\"Goodbye!\" Vulture bowed to Ji Shuirou with a smile.Then they left the Doublehawks Faction.They were soon out of Blackhill City and already on the way back.\"I didn't expect that I could buy the seed so easily from the Doublehawks Faction.\"Ji Shuilrou smiled and said to Su Mo and the other two, \"If not for you three, Vulture would have never sold me the Blue Black Flower Seed.\"\"Haha! The small Doublehawks Faction has to give the three sects face!\"Dong Yue smiled proudly.\"Vulture still knows his place.\"He Qian lightly smiled.Dong Yue and He Qian both smiled with a proud face. They both thought that it was because of their identities that Vulture decided to sell the Blue Black Flower Seed.Su Mo shook his head and warned them, \"Don't belittle Vulture. I think that he's not simple so we'd better be careful.\"Dong Yue chuckled and said, \"Brother Su, how is he not simple? Facing us, he still obediently gave up the seed.\"\"Haha! Brother Su, you are strong, but also too timid!\"He Qian chuckled, shaking his head and secretly looking down on Su Mo.Su Mo shook his head and did not say anything more. Those two men were too supercilious.Did the identifies of the disciples of the Four Sects really have such great power?The Inner Disciples of the Four Sects were probably famous, but Outer Disciples did not have the ability to command others to respect them.However, Su Mo did not want to debate with them. As Ji Shuirou had gotten the Blue Black Flower Seed, his mission had been completed.Quickly they galloped, then ate a meal in a passing town and resumed their journey after a short rest.\"Miss Ji, in another 50 kilometers, it'll be time to say goodbye! We're going to Yu Mountain,\" said He Qian to Ji Shuirou.\"Well, thanks for your escort. I'm unable to repay such a kindness,\" Ji Shuirou said in a polite manner.\"Miss Ji, you're quite welcome. This is our mission.\"He Qian lightly smiled.\"I'm afraid we're unable to leave!\" Su Mo suddenly said.\"Brother Su, why do you say that?\"The others were puzzled, and they looked at Su Mo.\"Look!\" Su Mo pointed in front of them.They saw dozens of people in black appear in their way ahead.Those men in black held long sabers, and they all masked their faces in black scarfs, only revealing pairs of cold eyes.They suddenly appeared and quickly surrounded Su Mo and the others.\"Ho! Ho! Ho!\"They hurriedly reined in their horses to stop.\"Who are you? What do you want?\"Ji Suirou shouted with a startled face.\"Where are you from? How dare you attack us? Do you know who we are?\"He Qian and Dong Yue cried in anger.No one answered them. The eyes of those men were all cold and flickered with killing desire.Su Mo looked these people up and down, squinting his eyes.All of those people were experts because even the worst one was at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.Two of them were at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.However, both of them were covered by broad black robes, and no one could see their faces.\"Kill them all, except for this woman!\" The two leaders coldly shouted.\"Kill!!!\"The men roared, exploding with raging vigor and rushing toward Su Mo and the others.\"You're courting death!\"He Qian's abilities were powerful, so he was not afraid of these bandits. He stamped his feet to fly forward, roaring and drawing his huge black sword out of its sheath at the same time. He chopped toward those people in black with his dazzling sword, which flashed across the sky.Boom!He Qian's chop was very strong, and three men in black were swept back by the sharp Sword Qi, coughing up blood.\"Go to hell!\"Dong Yue also had strong power. His waving fists were as hard as pig iron, and the fist shadows were as big as mountains. No one was his match.\"We'll deal with these two, you go and kill the others.\" The two leaders shouted and respectively rushed toward He Qian and Dong Yue.The four men tangled together.Sword radiance, fist shadows, and claw lights were everywhere, which continued to explode.One fought against He Qian, whose abilities were roughly the same as He Qian's.However, the man who fought against Dong Yue seemed stronger than Dong Yue, and gradually, Dong Yue was at a disadvantage.\"Kill!\"A large number of people in black rushed toward Ji Shuirou and her men.\"Protect Miss Ji!\"Several martial artists of the Ji clan loudly shouted, then tangled with them.All of the people in black were at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, so the martial artists of the Ji clan were unable to fight against them.In just one second, one was killed and two were seriously injured.\"How could this be?\"Ji Shuirou's face was pale.\"What can we do? Are we all going to die here?\"The Ji clan's martial artists were in the depths of despair.Right at that moment, they heard a sound.\"I'm here, so you won't die!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment that the words were finished, a dazzling sword radiance glimmered across the air.As the sword radiance flashed, blood spattered around from several people in black that were cut into two and died.Su Mo held his sword with a sword radiance that was as bright as the moon, and a Sword Qi that was as abundant as the starlight.Every time he swung his sword, blood spattered. Killing the men in black was as easy for him as cutting wheat.A dozen people died in one second.A man who accepted others' requests should try his best to accomplish them. Since he had accepted the mission, he had to ensure Ji Shuirou's safety.\"What?\"Ji Shuirou and the Ji clan's martial artists were thrilled. They had almost forgotten that there was a Gale Island's disciple.Judging from his performance, Su Mo's abilities were no less than He Qian's and Dong Yue's, although his cultivation was not as good as theirs.\"Bastard!\"The two leaders flew into a great rage when noticing the situation there.A martial artist at the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm had such dominant abilities. If Su Mo continued to kill, then all his men would be dead in a short time.\"Boy, I'll kill you!\"The man who was fighting against Dong Yue was incensed. He turned around to rush toward Su Mo, relinquishing Dong Yue.At the same time, six people in black at the peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm blocked Dong Yue.\"Go to hell!\"He clawed across the air toward Su Mo's head, roaring.He wore a pair of black metal gloves, which were shining with a cold light.Boom!Su Mo stabbed the man's hand with his sword, which a loud boom erupted from.Both men were equal in this attack!\"How is this possible?\"A hint of shock flashed in the leader's eyes. \"A martial artist at the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm is able to have the abilities of a martial artist at Lv 3!\"\"You're Vulture!\" Su Mo said all of a sudden.The man was surprised by his words, but then he smiled in an insidious way. \"Boy, you can recognize me. That's impressive!\"Su Mo sneered. His perception was very sensitive. He remembered Vulture's breath, so when he discovered that the man's breath was the same as Vulture's, he knew who he was.Besides, he had always suspected that Vulture would not easily give up the Blue Black Flower Seed.Having just left Blackhill City, they suffered such an attack. Who else could it have been besides the Doublehawks Faction?\"But even though you've recognized us, it's of no use. Because all of you are going to die!\"The man pulled the black robe away from his head and took the black scarf off of his face. It was the Doublehawks Faction's second master, Vulture.The other leader had to be the Doublehawks Faction's first master, Goshawk.Vulture smiled in a gruesome way. \"With such talents, you must be a genius disciple in Gale Island. Killing geniuses is my favorite!\"\"Really? But I'm afraid that you can't do that!\"Su Mo smiled in a contemptuous way. He sneered, \"I just need one strike to kill you!\"\"What?\"Vulture was enraged by Su Mo's words. He haughtily laughed. \"Boy, you don't know the immensity of heaven and earth. I'd like to see how you could kill me with one strike!\"\"Ah!\"Vulture roared and released his cyan eagle Martial Soul.Four yellow halos were shining over the Martial Soul, indicating that it was a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul.The cyan eagle had sharp eyes, and a berserk breath was released, filling the air.\"Go to hell! Eagles Flying in the Sky!\"Vulture shouted and made a claw, from which numerous claw lights burst out. That attack was more powerful than the previous one. He wanted to beat Su Mo in one strike.\"Cross Chopping Technique of the Wind Devil!\"The three Spiritual Spirals in Su Mo's elixir field were crazily rotating, releasing endless Genuine Qi. Su Mo waved his sword twice, releasing two razor-sharp Sword Qi. They formed into the shape of a cross, moving toward Vulture.This movement was the fifth skill of Swordplay of Wind Devil, which was stronger than Sword Essence of Wind Devil.Boom! Boom! Boom!The Sword Qi from the cross cracked the claw lights, collapsing everything, and finally hit Vulture hard.Whoosh!The Sword Qi from the cross ran through Vulture's body, who widened his eyes full of panic and cried in shock, \"How... how can this be?\"A large amount of blood surged out of his body after he said that. The next moment, his body cracked and was split into four parts, falling to the ground.The moment that Vulture died, he deeply regretted what he had done.He had not thought about selling the Blue Black Flower Seed to Ji Shuirou. But, he was very angry about the threats of He Qian and Dong Yue, even though he had been smiling.However, he did not dare to publicly kill the disciples of the three Sects.Therefore, he sold the Blue Black Flower Seed to Ji Shuirou.In his opinion, as long as he secretly killed these people, both the Blue Black Flower Seed and Ji Shuirou would be his.Su Mo and the others had just left the Doublehawks Faction, so he led some people to kill them with his big brother, Goshawk.He thought that it would only cost him a little effort, but unexpectedly, it cost him his life in the end.\"Er...\"The others were stunned.Looking at this incredible scene, everyone stopped fighting.Even He Qian and Goshawk stopped fighting as well.Su Mo, a martial artist at the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, killed Vulture, who was at the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, with one strike.\"Sh*t, he's so powerful!\"A Ji clan martial artist could not help swallowing.Ji Shuirou's eyes were full of surprise and admiration.Before, she had thought that Su Mo's power was comparable to He Qian's, but did not expect that Su Mo was so incredibly powerful.He Qian and Dong Yue were also shocked. They knew that Su Mo was powerful and even could be compared with He Qian.However, Su Mo's performance had been far beyond their expectations.Su Mo's face was very calm because he already knew that he was able to kill Vulture in one strike.He was at the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, but his power was far beyond that of a martial artist at the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, even without his sword will.His Genuine Qi among one Spiritual Spiral was comparable to that of a martial artist at Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm. And now he had three Spiritual Spirals, so he had triple power.Under these circumstances, if he was unable to kill Vulture in one strike, that would have been weird.\"Second Brother!\"The other leader, Goshawk, burst out with a sorrowful cry. He distraughtly shouted, \"Boy, I'll burn you!\"Goshaw turned around to rush toward Su Mo, crazily roared, and clawed at him with his hands.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Claw shadows were everywhere as endless claw lights shot across the air.\"Your brother's about to have some company!\" Su Mo coldly said.Sword radiance appeared along with his voice, blowing a howling gale.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"Invincible Sword Qi exploded with the raging wind.Boom! Boom! Boom!A series of explosions resounded. When the Sword Qi had dispersed and the wind was calm, Su Mo stood still.Goshawk lay on the ground not far from him, coughing up blood. There was a serious sword wound on his body, which extended from his shoulders to his lower abdomen.His guts and viscera had flowed out of his body. Obviously, he could not survive this.\"You're still alive after blocking my attack. You are indeed powerful!\"Su Mo was a little surprised. Goshawk's power was much stronger than Vulture's.Goshawk widened his eyes and shouted in disbelief, \"You... you can't be... at Lv 2!\"After saying that, Goshawk's pupils gradually dilated, then he died completely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he searched Goshawk and Vulture's storage pouches, he turned to the shocked Ji Shuirou with a smile and said, \"Miss Ji, now you're safe, and there should be no more dangers left on the way back. This's where I leave you!\"Ji Shuirou bowed hastily and nervously and said, \"Thank you so much for your help, sir. If not for you, we probably would have been in deep trouble!\"Ji Shuirou sighed inwardly. She had underestimated this young man. He was definitely a genius.Su Mo waved his hand and said, \"A man who accepts others' requests tries his best to accomplish them. Since I accepted this mission, I obviously had to try my best to protect you.\"Su Mo sighed and said, \"Miss Ji, it's not safe to linger here. I suggest you return to Maple Leaf City as quickly as possible!\"Ji Shuirou nodded, clasped her hands, and said, \"Well then we'll be on our way, Mr. Su Mo!\"\"Yes, goodbye!\" Su Mo bowed his head.\"Giddy up!\"With the whining of horses, Ji Shuirou and the other Ji family martial artists all left.\"Sir Su Mo, I expect you'll be quite famous in Skymoon Country!\"Ji Shuirou's voice drifted from afar.\"Haha!\"Su Mo smiled and said to himself quietly, \"I'm sure that day will come soon!\"Then, he looked at the bodies of Goshawk and his men, and his eyes lit up. \"The blood essence of all these martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm must be enough for me to enter the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm!\"\"Devour!\"His Martial Soul emerged and attracted large amounts of blood essence towards Su Mo.Su Mo had told Ji Shuirou and her subjects to leave quickly because he wanted to devour as soon as possible.Otherwise, after a while, all the useful blood essence and Blood Qi would disappear!He could not devour blood essence in front of Ji Shuirou.If news of his ability to devour blood essence and turn it into Qi got out, there would only be negative consequences for him.Devouring allowed Su Mo's cultivation to soar once again.In a short period of time, his cultivation rose to the peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, and the three Spiritual Spirals in his body filled with genuine Qi.Also, Su Mo's genuine Qi was still increasing, and if he could just break the cultivation bottleneck, he could enter into the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.Suddenly, two figures sped over from the distance.They were He Qian and Dong Yue.Su Mo saw them return and frowned, and he immediately stopped devouring.Their return forced Su Mo to stop his devouring and take back his Devouring Martial Spirit in frustration.In that moment, he almost felt compelled to kill them.However, he dismissed this idea immediately. These two men had done nothing wrong to him, and they even grew close during the past few days.If he engaged in mindless killing in order to devour blood essence, he would be no different from a vampire!\"Haha! That was fun! Brother Su, Brother He and I killed half of those men in black, and only a dozen got away!\" said Dong Yue with a chuckle as they neared.He Qian and Dong Yue stood in front of Su Mo, amazed by Su Mo's ability.Standing next to Su Mo again, they could not help but feel an amorphous power.\"Brother Su, where is Miss Ji?\"He Qian asked confusedly when he noticed that Ji Shuirou and Ji martial artists were not there.\"They went back already!\" Su Mo said. \"Let's go to Yu Mountain too!\"\"Alright, let's go!\" The two men nodded.Su Mo straddled his horse and led the way.\"Hm? What happened to these people? Why are they all dried up?\" asked Dong Yue as he was about to leave.He had spotted the corpses of Goshawk and his men, which were all shriveled into sticks, so he was confused.He Qian glanced at the corpses and guessed, \"Maybe they just bled out!\"\"Let's just get out of here as fast as possible!\" said He Qian.He spurred on his horse, and the two men followed Su Mo.They did not pay close attention to the corpses.In reality, Su Mo had not finished devouring their blood essence. Otherwise, they would completely be mummified instead of just being thin.Yu Mountain was a famous mountain in Skymoon Country.This mountain was in the Southwestern region of Skymoon Country. It was an isolated mountain that stood thousands of meters high.At the moment, there were hundreds of thousands of people congregated on Yu Mountain.They trailed from the peak down to the foot, crowded into a loud sea of heads.Also, there were still new crowds of people rushing onto Yu Mountain.\"Damn it! There are way too many people here!\"When Su Mo and his companions arrived at Yu Mountain after days of travel, they were shocked by what they saw.Dong Yue looked at the endless swarms of people and could not stop tsking.\"Let's just wait at the foot of the mountain!\" Su Mo said with a sigh.There were too many people on the mountain, and Su Mo did not want to be shoved around.All three of them were martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm, so they had visions that allowed them to clearly see battles more than five kilometers away.Also, it was said that Duan Jingtian and Jin Yang were both experts of the True Spirit Realm who had the ability to fly, so the battle was definitely not restricted to the peak.Su Mo found an empty section of ground and sat down cross-legged.There was only one day left until the Yu Mountain battle, so there was no time to waste.Su Mo closed his eyes and called upon his Martial Soul to absorb natural Spiritual Qi and cultivation Elephant's Strength Skill.\"With such a talent, yet brother Su still cultivates so hard. How admirable!\" exclaimed Dong Yue, who immediately joined Su Mo on the ground.\"I just saw a few people from my sect, so I'll leave you two!\" He Qian said to his companions and left.Time went by slowly, and more people came. By noon of the second day, there were at least a million people in Yu mountain.\"Look, brother Su, there're experts of the True Spirit Realm!\" Dong Yue suddenly said in surprise.Su Mo opened his eyes and saw an old man in a gray robe trod on colorful light, floating over from the sky.When he reached the top of Yu Mountain, the old man instantly landed on the peak.A large amount of the True Spirit Realm experts arrived at Yu Mountain one after another following this old man.\"Look, those are the elders of the Sky Yuan sect!\" Dong Yue yelled excitedly.A dozen people flew towards the far peak, each of them commanding a strong presence. They were all in the True Spirit Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn Skymoon Country, a martial artist in the True Spirit Realm was already considered to be in their peak.Those who had reached the True Spirit Realm were prestigious and prominent, either as elders among the four sects or powerful overlords.As for those above the True Spirit Realm, they were the Leaders of the four sects, the unparalleled experts. There were very few in Skymoon Country. Such experts did not emerge so easily.At Yu Mountain, the atmosphere was seething with excitement for the arrival of the True Spirit Realm experts.When else would you be able to see so many True Spirit Realm martial artists?\"Look, that's Cultivator Hanxuan, a True Spirit Realm Medium Rank martial artist. His Ice Cultivation Skill is so powerful that he once froze an entire mountain with his palm!\"Dong Yue looked excited.Su Mo looked up and saw a middle-aged man with a cold face flying through the sky. He emitted a cold fog that surrounded him. Wherever he went, the mist in the air turned into ice residue. It was unusually horrifying.The True Spirit Realm experts arrived at the peak of Yu Mountain one after another.On the mountain peak, the martial artists below the True Spirit Realm dared not get near. They could only view from afar.Time passed by. After a long time, another group of experts came through the sky. The group had a total of more than thirty people and consisted of both men and women.These people all had one thing in common. There was a sun symbol painted on the chest of each robe.Among these people, there was a cold-looking youth dressed in a crimson robe. His imposing manner was like an erupting volcano, emitting a destructive high temperature.When people saw the youth, they immediately started screaming!\"It is Jin Yang! Jin Yang is here. I did not expect the first elder of the inner gate from the Scorching Sun Sect to lead the team personally!\"\"Wow! So, he is one of the Four Talents of Skymoon Country, Jin Yang? This is the first time I have seen him!\"\"He is definitely worthy to be one of the Four Talents of Skymoon Country. He is indeed very special!\"\"Jin Yang's here. I suppose Duan Jingtian should be here anytime soon! I can not wait!\"Hearing the screams around him, Su Mo narrowed his eyes and watched the sky closely. \"This is Jin Yang, one of the most dazzling talents in Skymoon Country?\"His Qi alone revealed that he was indeed terribly strong.Su Mo mused that Jin Yang could crush him to death with just one finger.\"Looks like I need to work harder! In comparison to these top talents, I am still so far behind!\"Su Mo silently sighed, but he was not discouraged at all. Given his Martial Soul's talent, it wouldn't take long to surpass the Four Talents of Skymoon Country.On the mountain's peak, as the people of the Scorching Sun Sect arrived, many experts came up to pay their respects to them.\"My respect to the first elder, Lie Huo!\"The leader of the Scorching Sun Sect was a tall elderly man. Half of his hair was already white, but his face was unusually rosy.He was standing next to Jin Yang, but he was totally different from Jin Yang. Jin Yang's imposing manner was like a demonic devil, emitting a destructive aura.However, this elderly man did not leak out any aura. It was as if he was just an ordinary old man.But no one would underestimate him.He was the first elder of the inner gate of the Scorching Sun Sect and he was a super expert at Lv 9 True Spirit Realm. He was second only to the sect leader of the Scorching Sun Sect.\"Everyone, you may begin the ceremony!\"Lie Huo gazed at the audience without expression. He raised his hand slightly.The first elder of the Scorching Sun Sect arrived with more than ten elders. Many experts came over to chitchat, especially the unaffiliated True Spirit Realm experts who wanted to curry favor and be close to Lie Huo.\"Jin Yang, how confident are you about this battle with Duan Jingtian?\"An elder of the inner gate from the Sky Yuan Sect asked. He watched Jin Yang, who remained indifferent.Hearing this, others looked at Jin Yang eagerly.Jin Yang glanced at everyone. Even facing all the True Spirit Realm experts, Jin Yang still appeared indifferent. He replied, \"Win-Lose, it's 50-50!\"\"50-50?\"Everyone appeared to be lost in deep thought. Then someone laughed and said, \"You achieved cultivation of the True Spirit Realm four years ago while Duan Jingtian only ascended to the True Spirit Realm less than two years ago. 50-50? Jin Yang, you are being too humble!\"Everyone nodded their heads.Duan Jingtian might be more talented than Jin Yang, but at the age of 22, he was so young. Besides, his ascendance to the True Spirit Realm was still short. His foundation was not yet solid.For this battle, everyone was more optimistic about Jin Yang. They believed he had a higher chance of winning the battle.Jin Yang was a man of few words. He didn't talk, he merely stood silently staring off into the distance.He was waiting for Duan Jingtian to arrive.The time had come. He should be here!Even though Duan Jingtian was the one who had initiated this battle, he was also looking forward to it.Although \"Four Talents of Skymoon Country\" referred to the top four strongest talents in Skymoon Country, the four of them were also ranked according to their competencies.The leader of the four talents, undisputedly was Yun Jiankong, the legendary swordsman of the Sky Rapier Sect.The second of the four talents would be Xie Tianjue of the Sky Yuan Sect.Jin Yang was ranked third.Duan Jingtian was ranked fourth.Although Duan Jingtian was ranked fourth, it did not mean that his strength was the weakest.It was only because Duan Jingtian was younger than the other three and had became famous slightly later than them, that he was ranked fourth.Before Duan Jingtian made a name for himself, Skymoon Country had had only three talents. Once he reached legendary status, the Three Talents of Skymoon Country became the Four Talents of Skymoon Country.Although Duan Jingtian had achieved fame later than them, Jin Yang had never underestimated him.Duan Jingtian was a mysterious man, he had become prominent at a rocket speed. Jin Yang knew that he was slightly more talented than him and hence, he took this battle very seriously.Jin Yang was waiting.All the True Spirit Realm experts were waiting.Millions of people at Yu Mountain were also waiting.Su Mo was also waiting.All of them were waiting for Duan Jingtian to arrive.While waiting, Su Mo recognized a few familiar faces.Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, Shen Qing and more than ten disciples of Gale Island were among the crowds.They were members of the Sky Alliance. Their leader was going to battle with Jin Yang. Of course they were here to watch the battle.In fact, it was not just them. The rest of the Sky Alliance members and numerous Gale Island disciples had also come.Time passed by slowly. Finally, after another two hours,A light shone on the horizon and once again, a large group of figures arrived.He was coming!Everyone was excited.After a while, the light approached. It was a group of people from Gale Island.The leader of Gale Island was also an elder. He had a small thin build and a pair of sharp eyes.They landed at the peak of Yu Mountain. However, after looking around and not finding Duan Jingtian, many were disappointed.\"Tang Yuan, where is Duan Jingtian? How come he is not here yet?\"The first elder of the Scorching Sun Sect, Lie Huo asked with a frown, looking at the leading old man from Gale Island.\"So it's Elder Lie Huo. I don't know Duan Jingtian's whereabouts, but since he dared to challenge, I do believe he will be here soon,\" the leading elder of Gale Island said, shaking his head.He was Tang Yuan, the second elder of the inner gate of Gale Island.\"What? Do not know his whereabouts?\"Lie Huo frowned. He sneered and said, \"Has he become a coward? Is he going to give up on this battle?\"\"Hmm! Lie Huo, you can just wait and see. See if he is afraid!\"The second elder Tang Yuan huffed coldly.Among the three big Sects, the relationship between the Scorching Sun Sect and Gale Island was the worst.Not only were the seniors of both sects hostile to one another, but even their disciples were frequently in conflict.\"Let us wait for another two hours. If he is still not here by then, we will go...\"Lie Huo did not finish his sentence. He suddenly stopped and turned his head, looking towards the sky. There were bursts of shock waves coming from that direction.They were waves of aura. An appalling aura that became perilous and swept through the sky.Everyone, including Su Mo, immediately turned their gaze to the edge of the sky. They saw a golden rainbow breaking through the sky at lightning speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What an incomparably elegant youth!\"Duan Jingtian!\"\"In the end, Duan Jingtian comes!\"\"This peerless talent deserves such matchless elegance. He is indeed one in a million!\"\"... \"The crowd exclaimed at Duan Jingtian's arrival, and at once they burst into an uproar.Now that Duan Jingtian had come, the fight should begin!The Yu Mountain in the limelight would witness bouts of the top talents in Skymoon Country.Hundreds of the Sky Alliance's members hurried to the crowd and all applauded, their eyes full of reverence and worship.Su Mo was amazed at Duan Jingtian's graceful postures up in the void.\"Duan Jingtian really deserves his reputations!\"Proudly standing in the void, Duan Jingtian looked down at the crowd and fixed his eyes onto Jin Yang.\"So many are the talents in Skymoon, only I can be God's favored one!\"Duan Jingtian lightly said, suddenly rising high into the welkin.\"So many are the talents in Skymoon, only I can be God's favored one!\"Everyone present was astounded by Duan Jingtian's confident and arrogant words.Regarding countless talents as nothing, Duan Jingtian proclaimed himself to be the only chosen one in Skymoon Country.God's favored one, God's chosen one!Duan Jingtian's unparalleled confidence revealed that only he could be the most outstanding warrior in this country.\"Arrogance!\"Jin Yang said after a sneer, rising up subsequently to the front of Duan Jingtian.Millions of people in the Yu Mountain immediately quieted down, staring at the two men up in the welkin.Su Mo also stood up and looked at the two men who were at a stalemate.Duan Jingtian and Jin Yang gazed into each other's eyes, and their growing fighting desires dispersed the thick clouds in the welkin.Overwhelming aura swept widely like torrents.At the foot of the Yu Mountain, which was several kilometers away from the two men, Su Mo still felt breathless as if pressed by a huge mountain.\"To defeat you, 30 strikes will be enough!\"Duan Jingtian said, calmly looking at Jin Yang with his startling words.The crowd below were stunned again by Duan Jingtian's inordinate self-conceit.Since Jin Yang was also one of the Four Talents of Skymoon Country, was that possible for Duan Jingtian to defeat him within only 30 strikes?But for their well-matched strength, heavyweights like Duan Jingtian and Jin Yang would possibly tie in the end after hundreds or even thousands of strikes.But according to Duan Jingtian's words, he could definitely defeat Jin Yang with only 30 strikes.Did Duan Jingtian far exceed Jin Yang?\"What?\"Jin Yang bellowed with a sullen face. As one of the top martial artist in Skymoon Country, he shouldn't have been despised.Jin Yang sneered and added, \"Duan Jingtuan, how arrogant you are! Except Yun Jiankong, no one of our generation in this country can defeat me within 30 strikes, neither can you!\"\"Shut up and fight!\"Cool and wordless, Duan Jingtian drew a brilliant pure-golden halberd.He wielded his golden halberd, which gave off spreading golden radiances immediately. The void exploded as if there were a landslide.\"Broken!\"Jin Yang bellowed by brandishing his fiery-red saber. Formidable sword Qi of the same fiery-red blocked Duan Jingtian's attack.Boom! Boom! Boom!Earthshaking explosions sounded, devastating gales swept in the void.As the fierce winds blew through the Yu Mountain, many people, though several kilometers far away from the battlefield, looked pale and vomited blood for they could not bear such impacts.\"Too powerful!\"\"Really horrible!\"\"Is this the real strength of the Four Talents?\"The crowd became shocked, and some of the weaker martial artists even stepped back to the mountainside.There left only relatively strong martial artists who stood still and stared at the high-altitude fight.After tentative strikes, Duan Jingtian and Jin Yang began to go all out.Dazzling residual shadows flew all over the void; golden radiances collided with red ones; air-tearing explosions emitted shock waves without stop.This fight was far beyond what normal martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm could imagine!Looking up at the fight, Su Mo inwardly thought with a sigh, \"I'm too weak even to figure out their fast moves.\"What he could see were nothing but the illuminating golden radiances, the penetrating saber radiance, and the destructive airflows generated by incessant explosions.\"I will be as mighty as them in one year!\"Su Mo murmured and walked away with no hesitation.He came here only to see how powerful the top talents were in Skymoon Country. Now he knew fairly well.He did not care about the outcome of their fight.\"Hey, Brother Su, why are you leaving?\"Dong Yue hastily asked when he found Su Mo was going to leave.\"I have something else to deal with, I'm leaving now.\"Su Mo said with a farewell wave, and added, \"Brother Dong, may we meet again some other day!\"Afterwards, Su Mo left the Yu Mountain and returned to Gale Island.Five days later, Su Mo went back to the Waterside City, and once again took an ironclad sailboat to return to Gale Island.Su Mo directly went to the mission palace after his arrival.Few visitors could be seen in front of the mission palace, which was very different from the bustle of the past.Su Mo guessed those disciples must have been spectators for that fight, which explained why there was nobody in the mission palace.Su Mo stepped in and submitted his tasks, successfully gained 120 contribution points.He was not quite clear how Gale Island verified whether the tasks were well accomplished. There must be available channels to confirm it, anyway.Su Mo had still had 375 contribution points left before he came back, and now he owned altogether 495 contribution points plus the 120 ones he had newly obtained.Tasks submitted, Su Mo went towards his dorm room.Just as he came to his courtyard, Su Mo heard fighting noises and Li Feng's laughter.Su Mo chuckled and shook his head, guessing Li Feng was \"messing with\" Niu Xiaohu.As he expected, Su Mo saw Niu Xiaohu wildly beating Li Feng the moment he walked in.Li Feng, looking rested with one hand behind his back, used the other hand easily fighting off Niu Xiaohu's attacks.\"Raging Bull Fist!\"Niu Xiaohu bent his body with a growl and rested his fists upon his head. Robust as a bull, he suddenly dashed to Li Feng with a quick tread.\"Good job, Xiaohu, I didn't know you could have such a powerful strike!\"Li Feng said with admiration when he observed Niu Xiaohu's attack.Li Feng threw a thundering punch at Niu Xiaohu in a flash. Niu Xiaohu was at once knocked away and landed on his butt.Su Mo was surprised at Li Feng's cultivation breaths, which was elevated to Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo nodded and thought, \"Li Feng possesses a Martial Soul of the Rank 7 Human Class. His initial cultivation was already approaching the Peak Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. It's was made sense that he reached the Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Niu Xiaohu had made drastic progress too. Now he went close to the Late-stage at the Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Have you completed all the missions?\"Li Feng smiled when he saw Su Mo walking into the court.\"Yeah, I'm back!\" Su Mo nodded.\"Senior Brother Su Mo, you're finally back! People are saying you wouldn't make it back!\"An overjoyed Niu Xiaohu immediately got up from the ground.\"Oh, why did they say I wouldn't make it back?\"Su Mo was amused to hear that.\"Many said you would lose your life doing all those tough missions ranked three and three-and-a-half with your Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm cultivation.\"Niu Xiaohu smiled. \"I know you would not die and will definitely return after completing those missions.\"Niu Xiaohu had confidence in Su Mo.\"I only accept missions I am confident to finish,\" Su Mo said, shaking his head.\"Su Mo!\"Li Feng called out, his face looking grave. \"I heard you have accepted the Duel of Life and Death against Shen Qing at the Decisive Struggle Hall?\"\"You are right!\"Su Mo nodded.After a few moments of silence, Li Feng said in a deep voice, \"You are too impulsive! I heard Shen Qing broke through to Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm half a month ago. Aren't\u00a0you playing with fire by accepting this duel?\"Li Feng was worried. Su Mo had saved his life and he was grateful to him.Thus, he would not want any mishap to fall upon Su Mo.\"Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm?\"Su Mo's eyebrows knitted but relaxed immediately. He said with a smile, \"Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm is not invincible. It is still not for sure who will die in the duel!\"\"What?\"Li Feng was shocked and his mouth twitched.It was not sure who would die in the duel?Was Su Mo saying he would kill a martial artist of Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm?Li Feng had thought he was arrogant, but Su Mo was obviously worse.His arrogance was superficial, but Su Mo's was from deep within.\"Senior Brother Su Mo, are you confident? If not, please back out from the duel against Shen Qing!\" Niu Xiaohu said, reminding him.Su Mo felt warmth in his heart. Though they seemed like weaklings, they were worried about him.\"I will respect those who respect me and kill those who do not!\"He said this dryly, cold light flashing in his eyes.This was his basic principle. He would not draw back whether his opponent was an expert at Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm or a disciple of the Sky Alliance.Having said that, he waved his hands and returned to his room.Inside his room, he looked down and became lost in thought.Sky Alliance?If they had not caused trouble for him, he was ready to forget about the past. After all, the Sky Alliance was not his enemy.He only had a conflict with Yan Qi.If they really wanted to kill him, he would fight back.After a long time, Su Mo sighed. He waved his hands and a dozen of storage pouches appeared.These storage pouches were all spoils from his recent trip.There were storage pouches of Goshawk and Vulture, as well as the Blood Blade and other experts of the Bloody Blade Stockade.He opened all the pouches and the radiance from the treasures suddenly lit up the whole room.Seeing so many spoils in front of him, his breath immediately became short and rapid.The properties of the Bloody Blade Stockade, Goshawk, and Vulture were much more than the poor Jade-faced Playboy.Soon, he checked all his spoils. There were 780 thousand taels of golds, 36 pieces of various weapons, 45 Martial Scrolls, 32 bottles of elixirs, eight Spiritual Herbs, and 30 Spiritual Stones.The spoils this round were far better than the one he previously earned in the Qingyuan Trial Test.\"Killing is really the fastest way of making a fortune!\"Su Mo sighed and checked the spoils thoroughly.The levels of these weapons were all below the Medium Lv 2, making them useless to him. He could contribute them to the Sect to exchange for contribution points.The Martial Scrolls were similar to the weapons. Most were of the Lower Lv 2. Only some were of the Medium Lv 2. These were useless to Su Mo as well.As for the 32 bottles of elixirs, half were healing elixir for injury treatment and the rest were for increasing cultivation.The eight Spiritual Herbs were all Spiritual Herbs of Lower Lv 2.There were 30 Lower Spiritual Stones.\"Now that my cultivation has reached the Spiritual Martial Realm, I can now use the Spiritual Stones for my cultivation!\"He put the Spiritual Stones, scrolls, and weapons into the storage ring.He was left with only 12 bottles of elixirs for increasing cultivation.These elixirs were all of the Lower Lv 2, which were quite useful for his cultivation.He picked out an elixir and swallowed it before starting to refine the elixir efficacy to cultivate the Elephant's Strength Skill with the power of the elixir.The Spiritual Qi of the elixir was quickly absorbed by his body at an incredible speed.Having cultivated the Elephant's Strength Skill, his body was like a bottomless pit. The more Spiritual Qi he absorbed, the faster his body force increased.By absorbing one elixir, he felt his body force increased greatly. The effect was comparable to him spending several regular days to cultivate.\"The speed of Spiritual Qi absorption is pretty amazing for this Body Refining Skill!\"Su Mo took a deep breath and continued to swallow the elixir. This time round, he swallowed 10 at once.Boom!After he swallowed those elixirs, the elixir efficacy exploded like a volcanic eruption and pure Spiritual Qi raged in his body.The Elephant's Strength Skill started to react and large numbers of Spiritual Qi turned into shadows of small elephants roaring silently. Hundreds of elephants roared at the same time, shaking his heart.Shortly after, the effect of the 10 elixirs was absorbed.His body strength increased a level higher. The Lv 4 of his Elephant's Strength Skill had reached the peak of the initial stage, making his strength comparable to a martial artist of Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm.Su Mo didn't stop and poured out 12 bottles of elixirs.He popped over 140 elixirs into his mouth.Bang! Bang! Bang!When the effectiveness of over 100 elixirs released, Su Mo's body was shaken so violently that he nearly could not hold it with his body strength.He immediately worked on the Elephant's Strength Skill to absorb the pills.This time around, a strange phenomenon happened in his body.The violent Spiritual Qi suddenly transformed into the shadow of a huge elephant. The elephant stood tall, with its foot on the ground and its long nose rolled up toward the inverted Milky Way.The elephant's shadow appeared only briefly before disappearing into Su Mo's body.Crackle!Su Mo suddenly felt numbness in his muscles and bones. With the sound of an explosion, his body strength then increased by 10 times.Su Mo was elated and scanned his body.His Elephant's Strength Skill has reached Lv 4 of the Peak of the Middle-stage. His body force was as good as a top martial artist of Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.\"Too fast! The efficacy of over 100 elixirs to increase the body is comparable to increasing the cultivation by swallowing blood essence!\"Su Mo was amazed. \"Since I can increase my cultivation with these elixirs, they will definitely help me achieve the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.\"He knew it would delay his progress the moment he decided to cultivate his genuine Qi and body at the same time.\"With my current body strength, I should be able to condense the fourth Spiritual Spiral!\"He rested for a moment before beginning to work on the Nine Spirals Mystique. He began to compact the fourth Spiritual Spiral.Though his body strength had increased more than 10 times, it was still tough to try and compact the fourth Spiritual Spiral and the third Spiritual Spiral.He was extremely tired with sweat on his head after trying for an entire day and night. Finally, he successfully compacted the fourth Spiritual Spiral.When he was done filling the four Spiritual Spirals with genuine Qi, he stopped his cultivation.It was time to exchange contribution points for items.This time, he wanted to exchange some treasures, beast souls, and elixirs with his contribution points. The more, the merrier.Su Mo smiled and was about to walk out of the room when he heard a loud shout coming from outside the courtyard.\"Su Mo, hurry up and get your ass here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They came out to find out what was going on.In his room, a cold look flashed across Su Mo's eyes when he heard the voice.Was Yan Qi really tired of living?The person outside the garden was Yan Qi.Su Mo walked out of his room and headed out.Niu Xiaohu and Li Feng were startled by the voice as well. They stepped out of their rooms and went out of the garden with Su Mo.There were about eight Outer Disciples standing at the entrance to the garden, along with Yan Qi and Feng Zilan.These people were the disciples of the Sky Alliance.Each one of them wore haughty expressions with their heads held high up when they looked at Su Mo, belittling him.\"Su Mo, you have agreed to a battle to the death at the Decisive Struggle Hall earlier against my Senior Brother, Shen Qing. Now that you are back, don't tell me you are going to chicken out.\"Yan Qi sneered at Su Mo. \"He is at the Decisive Struggle Hall. You should be making your way there now!\"\"Su Mo, you are considered quite the talent, but if you back out now, would not it tarnish your newly built reputation?\"Feng Zilan tried to provoke Su Mo as she was afraid that Su Mo would back out from the duel.Su Mo looked coldly at the two of them. \"Since Shen Qing cannot wait to end his life, I will be more than happy to meet him. Let us go!\"He started to walk in the direction of the Decisive Struggle Hall.\"Su Mo, no!\"Li Feng quickly held Su Mo back, looking very worried. \"Su Mo, you must not be impulsive. As long as you do not go to the Decisive Struggle Hall, they can not do anything to you!\"\"That is right! Senior Brother Su Mo, you must not go!\"Niu Xiaohu looked very worried as well.\"Ridiculous!\"Before Su Mo could open his mouth, a disciple of the Sky Alliance standing beside Yan Qi gave Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu a sharp look. He shouted coldly, \"Who are you to meddle in the affairs of the Sky Alliance? Do you want to die?\"Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu shivered. The very thought of the power of the Sky Alliance frightened them.Li Feng bit his lips, trying hard to calm himself down. \"Don't you try and bully us. Though your Sky Alliance is powerful, it does not mean you can do anything you want!\"\"Hahaha!\"Yan Qi and the rest laughed. The one who made the comment earlier said proudly, \"We are proud of our Senior Brother Duan. He is very powerful and has defeated Jin Yang. No one can rival him. Under his leadership, it is no problem for us to dominate all of Skymoon Country, let alone Gale Island!\"The disciples of the Sky Alliance gave an arrogant look.The duel on Yu Mountain was their pride.The disciples who had crowded around looked shocked to hear this. Was there an outcome to the duel on Yu Mountain already? Who won?Had Duan Jingtian defeated Jin Yang?\"Just as I thought!\"Su Mo sighed. Duan Jingtian had defeated Jin Yang!Li Feng was taken aback as well but continued to motion for Su Mo not to go for the duel.\"Li Feng, Xiaohu, do not worry about me! I will be fine!\"Su Mo patted them on the shoulder and gave them a reassuring look before leaving for the Decisive Struggle Hall.Yan Qi and the rest were elated and quickly followed behind.Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu were very worried and headed towards the hall as well.\"Sh*t! Su Mo's really tired of living! He is going for the battle to the death with Shen Qing!\"\"He is tired of living, setting himself against the Sky Alliance!\"\"Come, let us go to the Decisive Struggle Hall and see what happens!\"\"...\"The disciples were stupefied and all quickly made their way to the hall as well.Upon seeing such a big crowd, those disciples they met on the way to the hall also joined them after hearing what had happened.The Decisive Struggle Hall was a special hall on Gale Island. Besides a huge fighting ring, nothing could be found there.The moment Su Mo stepped into the hall, he saw Shen Qing sitting cross-legged on the fighting ring.When their eyes met, it was as if there were explosions in the air.\"Su Mo, I have waited so long for you!\"Shen Qing smiled, a murderous look forming in his eyes.\"You should thank me for letting you live a little longer!\"Su Mo entered the hall and immediately landed on the fighting ring.A huge number of the Outer Disciples followed suit and flooded into the hall.Within a short period of time, the hall was packed with hundreds of people.When Yan Qi and Feng Zilan saw Su Mo on the fighting ring, their eyes were filled with a murderous look.They were very excited. Today was the day Su Mo would die!There were many disciples of the Sky Alliance in the hall and all of them were grinning.Those who dare go against the Sky Alliance would have to die!\"Are you not ashamed to make such a boastful remark?\" Shen Qing asked with a nasty look in his eyes.Those who stepped onto the fighting ring of the Decisive Struggle Hall had agreed to put their lives at stake, without holding the other party responsible.Shen Qing stood up and looked at Su Mo with disdain. \"Su Mo, today I shall use your blood to uphold the sovereignty of the Sky Alliance.\"\"What are you waiting for?\" Su Mo was not bothered by the threat. He found it interesting to see how Shen Qing would do as he said.\"Killing you will be a piece of cake!\"Shen Qing gave a wicked grin. He acknowledged that Su Mo had great strength, but his cultivation had now reached the Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm. Killing Su Mo was a simple task.\"Die!\"Shen Qing shouted. He flung a heavy punch toward Su Mo.\"Fallingstar Fist!\"The flash of a fist pierced through space, creating a great impact.\"It is the Medium Lv 2 Martial Skill, Fallingstar Fist! It is so powerful!\"\"Judging from his momentum, Shen Qing must have reached the Minor Completion Realm. He is amazing!\"\"This blow is enough to kill Su Mo!\"Everyone was taken aback by the power of the technique that created a great force in the air.It would be impossible for those who havd not reached Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm to take this blow.\"You are digging your own grave!\" Su Mo said. A ray of sword radiance flashed across, counteracting the Fist technique.\"Die!\"Su Mo's desire to kill Shen Qing was very strong. He jumped into the air, passed through the Fist print, and thrust his sword at Shen Qing.\"What?\"Shen Qing was shocked, in disbelief that Su Mo not only countered his attack easily but also turned around and attacked him.\"To your grave!\"Garnering all his energy, Shen Qing went all out to kill Su Mo.Shadows of the fist flashed from all directions toward Su Mo.He was totally surrounded by the shadows of the fist.\"Hahaha! You can't escape now!\"Shen Qing grinned. He had used all his strength. Any ordinary person in the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm wouldn't be able to take the blow. This blow would be enough to take Su Mo's life.Seeing that Su Mo was about to be hit by the shadows of the fist, Shen Qing could not help shaking his head. This duel was so uninteresting, not at all challenging.At this juncture, a ray of sword radiance flashed across and countered the blow.\"Die!\"Immediately after these words were spoken, a powerful ray of sword radiance flashed through and destroyed everything that stood in its way.\"Oh no!\"Shen Qing could not believe his eyes. The speed of the sword radiance was too fast for him to react to.Whoosh!Fresh blood spurted out as an arm was flung into the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He rapidly retreated.Half of his body was already stained with blood. He did not only lose an arm but half his shoulder.Had he not twist his body at the crucial moment, he would have already been cut in half by Su Mo's sword.The entire hall was stunned into silence.Everyone was shocked by what they saw.They all thought victory definitely belonged to Shen Qing but the changes came too suddenly. In front of Su Mo, Shen Qing had unexpectedly become so vulnerable.Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu were also stupefied. They never imagined Su Mo to have such a strong power.On the other hand, Yan Qi and Feng Zilan looked gloomy.\"Good-for-nothing!\"Yan Qi cursed in his heart. Shen Qing was too useless against Su Mo.On the fighting ring, Shen Qing's face twisted hideously from the sharp pain he was feeling. Vast amounts of blood spilled from his shoulder.His breathing was haggard and his body was swaying.\"Su Mo, it was my carelessness this time! Someday I will make you pay for my lost arm!\"Shen Qing gnashed his teeth in anger. Though he felt a strong hatred, he knew he was too weak to fight in his current state.He stared at Su Mo resentfully before turning around. He wanted to step off the fighting ring.\"Did I say I would let you go?\"With the resounding indifferent voice, Su Mo's figure disappeared and reappeared to block Shen Qing's path.\"Su Mo, you dare kill me?\" Shen Qing frowned.\"We are in the fighting ring in the Decisive Struggle Hall. If you lose, you should be ready to die,\" Su Mo indifferently said.\"Hahaha...!\"Shen Qing laughed and sneered. \"I am a member of the Sky Alliance. You dare kill me? Do you know how many people belong to the Sky Alliance in the whole Outer or inside the hall? You actually want to kill me?\"Shen Qing wore an expression full of disdain. In this fight, his original plan was to kill Su Mo and not the other way around.Even if he had lost, he did not worry about his life. On Gale Island, who had the guts to kill a member of the Sky Alliance?If someone actually dared to do so, he would be declaring war against Duan Jiangtian and the entire Sky Alliance. Shen Qing was certain Su Mo would not have the courage to do so.\"Su Mo, let Shen Qing go and we will spare you this time!\"\"Su Mo, If you dare to kill Shen Qing, there will be no place for you to hide on Gale Island.\"\"Humph, it is always our Sky Alliance who kill others! Who dares to kill one of us?\"\"...\"Dozens of the Sky Alliance disciples were crying in succession below the fighting right.\"Heh! Just kill him! Su Mo , you had better kill Shen Qing. That way, I would not even have to deal with you and you will die without a burial ground!\"Yan Qi sneered internally.Though he was angry about Shen Qing's failure, he knew Su Mo would make himself the enemy of the whole Sky Alliance if he killed Shen Qing. Then he would die sooner or later!\"Su Mo, you took my Empty Spirit Fruits and my storage pouch, and even killed my clan disciple. You have to die!\"Yan Qi roared in his heart.He already knew Su Mo was the one who killed his cousin, Yan Xing.Back then, Su Mo did not kill everyone from Yan Xing's group and one managed to escape. It was him who told Yan Qi.In fact, when the Qingyuan Trial Test had just ended, Yan Qi sought out his older brother, the Inner Disciple Yan Ba.He wanted Yan Ba to kill Su Mo.As a distinguished Inner Disciple, it was easy for Yan Ba to kill an Outer Disciple. The upper ranks of Gale Island would not severely punish an Inner Disciple for killing an Outer Disciple.However, he was reproached by his brother instead.Yan Ba just said, \"As my brother, if you can not deal with a new insignificant disciple, then you do not need to stay on Gale Island anymore. Why don't you just go home?\"So Yan Qi had no choice but to figure it out by himself.Fortunately, many disciples of the Sky Alliance knew he was Yan Ba's brother and were willing to help him.Shen Qing was one of them.A handsome and distinguished boy in white stood up among the crowd just then. He carried a white bow on his back.\"A swordsman should have peerless shine. He should be unyielding, fearless, and kill those in his way. I hope you will not disappoint me.\"The boy dressed in white murmured, eyes gleaming.On the fighting ring, Shen Qing sneered and loftily said, \"Su Mo, we will fight again after my injuries heal. But next time, I will not be careless anymore!\"Su Mo smiled mockingly at him.Did the Sky Alliance actually afford him such confidence?The next moment, a dazzlingly bright light filled everyone's sights and flew past like a spray of Aurora lights.Whoosh!The cold ray of light gradually vanished as the sword cut cleanly through the throat.Bang!Shen Qing collapsed on the fighting ring, dead with open eyes.Silence!The entire hall was dead silent.Everyone's eyes were wide open in disbelief at Su Mo's straight figure.He killed him!Shen Qing, a disciple of the Sky Alliance, was dead.\"Damn it!\"After a short while, the hall suddenly burst into fury.Many of the Sky Alliance disciples were red in the face, enraged.Su Mo actually dared to kill Shen Qing in front of them. That meant he completely thought nothing of them and the entire Sky Alliance.\"I will fight you!\"Whoosh!A young man dressed in black took one step to enter the fighting ring, his expression cold.\"It is Senior Brother Ding Tao!\"\"Senior Brother Ding Tao is very powerful. He must be able to kill Su Mo.\"Everyone began gushing about the youth who stepped into the fighting ring.\"You are no match for me. Do you want to die?\"Su Mo looked at the young man dressed in black indifferently. This man was just in the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, yet still incredibly wanted to fight him.\"Humph! You are too arrogant! You are just in the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm. How dare you say I am no match for you?\"Ding Tao's face was hiding his murderous intention. \"If Senior Brother Shen Qing did not get careless, you would not have won!\"\"Okay then, show me what you have got!\"Su Mo shook his head. Now that Ding Tao had overreached himself to fight him, there was nothing for him to say.\"Martial Soul, Ghost Hand!\"Ding Tao did not underestimate Su Mo and immediately freed his Martial Soul, with a palm as dark as ink. It was surrounded by seven yellow shining halos that were suspended in the sky.This palm Martial Soul was full of gloom and looked like a paw that had ascended from hell.Su Mo raised his eyebrow. It was the first time that he had seen such a strange Martial Soul.\"Die!\"Ding Tao overturned his palm and coagulated a gloomy giant black palm, as his Martial Soul shone.\"Hand of Death!\"The black palm carried with it a chilly wind, pressuring Su Mo.Su Mo was surprised. No wonder this person was so confident in fighting him. He actually had such an uncommon strength.His strength was twice as great as Goshawk's in the Doublehawks Faction.Even so, he still was not Su Mo's match.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Mo was no worse than the average martial artists in the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm.Swosh!His long sword giving off a dazzling radiance, Su Mo brandished it 13 times in a row, making an air-tearing sound.\"Sword Essence of Wind Devil!\"The sword radiance was chilling and 13 rays of sword Qi converged to release the piercingly invincible sword essence. It was enough to destroy everything that blocked its path.Tch!Ding Tao's black palm was easily torn the moment it collided with Su Mo's sword essence, and consequently, the devastating sword essence struck him hard.Whoosh!Su Mo's sword essence pierced Ding Tao's body and blood gushed from his wounds.Ding Tao was instantly split in two.Ding Tao, a martial artist in the Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm, was killed by only one slash!\"You are the one who seeking your death, you can not blame me!\"Su Mo shook his head in disdain.Dead silence once again hung over the hall.The crowd felt astounded as they looked at the tall boy standing on the fighting ring.He was too aggressive and domineering!Was he really a warrior at Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm? How could he easily slash someone at Lv 4 and kill Ding Tao, who was at Lv 4? He was violating logic!\"What arrogance! He actually killed two of our people!\"\"You are really asking for it!\"\"Kill him! Seniors, go up and kill him! Avenge our Sky Alliance!\"Those from the Sky Alliance was truly angered this time, the fury in their eyes burning wildly.Some of the weaker disciples who feared Su Mo dared not step forward, only resting their hopes on their fellow elites.Clump! Clump! Clump!From the reverberating sound of footsteps, a young man dressed in purple walked out of the crowd.This man, with a long sword hanging on his waistband, looked handsome, tall, and extraordinarily charming.Approaching the fighting ring, he rose high into the sky with a tread before graciously landing on the ring.\"Su Mo, you killed two of my fellow disciples. I swear I will not let you leave the Decisive Struggle Hall alive.\"The young man glared at Su Mo with a sullen face.\"It is Senior Brother Zhao Fu!\"\"Haha! With Brother Zhao Fu around, Su Mo's dead meat!\"\"Of course! He possesses a Rank 8 Human Class Martial Soul and already reached the Lv 4 last year. Now I suppose he has elevated to the Peak!\"The crowd immediately began chattering about Zhao Fu as soon they saw him on the ring.Yan Qi smirked, and so did Feng Zilan.Su Mo was too bold to ruthlessly kill members of the Sky Alliance!Now that he had aroused public outrage, both would really like to see how he would try and survive this.On the fighting ring, Su Mo frowned. He had just killed Ding Tao, but here came another one.\"You people from the Sky Alliance are so shameless! After I killed the first, the second one comes! After I killed the second, here comes the third! Are you guys attempting victory by attrition?\"Su Mo scoffed sarcastically.\"You recklessly killed our fellow brothers. That is a disgrace of the Sky Alliance. Only your death can wash off our shame.\"Zhao Fu said, his ghastly eyes filled with murderous intention.\"Their death is a disgrace to Sky Alliance? You mean it is fine for you all to kill me but not the other way around? Ridiculous!\" Su Mo said scornfully.\"I do not want to waste time talking to a dying man. You and I both practice swordplay. Today I will show you what a real swordsman is like.\"Zhao Fu snorted and added, \"You go first!\"Su Mo squinted. These people really did not know what it meant to stop before everything was too late.Even if he could kill Zhao Fu, there were still others would stand out and fight him again.But since Zhao Fu was already on the fighting ring, he would not cower either.Whoosh!With a flash of the sword radiance, Su Mo sent a ray of sword Qi at Zhao Fu across the air. It was his attempt at testing his opponent.\"You think this puny attack can hurt me?\"Zhao Fu sneered. With a clang, he unsheathed his sword and effortlessly smashed the oncoming sword Qi with a mere shake of his long sword.\"I only need three stabs to kill you!\" Zhao Fu lightly said.He instantly leaped up with growing fighting desire and stabbed with his brilliant sword, making a thundering bang.\"Thunder Swordplay, Thunder Shocking the World!\"Indigo sword Qi besieged by thunder and lighting emitted cracking sounds.Staring at the coming stab, Su Mo though his opponent was far better than Ding Tao and truly deserved to be a Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.\"Cross Chopping Technique of Wind Devil!\"Whoosh! Whoosh!Two flickering rays of fierce sword Qi intersected and collided with the thundering force.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sword Qi exploded, its destructive aftermath sweeping the ring.\"Infinite Thunder Force!\"Zhao Fu once again wielded his word, having cut down one strike, with even stronger permeating sword momentum.\"Die!\" Zhao Fu cried.Crackle!Zhao Fu's sword Qi was akin to the sound of thunder striking the earth from the heaven, its thunder doubling in power.\"You are way too weak to kill me!\"A raging gale suddenly surged in the next moment, which was accompanied by a sharp sword voice.\"Swirling Winds and Clouds!\"Su Mo's sword power and his wind force interplayed in the eye of the raging gale, once again sweeping away Zhao Fu's Thunder Sword Qi.\"You are not that bad! I'd say you are qualified to witness my strongest swordplay!\"Surprise fleeted across Zhao Fu's face but he turned arrogant.Instantly, a white sword shadow rose high behind him. It was a Sword Martial Soul of the Rank 8 Human Class.After releasing his martial soul, he looked as if he had incarnated a peerless sword whose sharp sword Qi pierced into the welkin.Swoosh!Zhao Fu dashed close to Su Mo, agile and quick like a leopard.A gleaming sword radiance turned into lightning and hurled toward Su Mo as if it were thunder and lightning breaking through the void.\"One Stab of the Thunder Swordsmanship!\"As the name implied, this stab, as swift as lightning, was formidable like rolling thunder.\"It is the One Stab of Thunder Swordsmanship! It is too powerful!\"\"It is the final technique of Thunder Swordplay. Its attack power is comparable to the Upper Lv 2 Martial Skill.\"\"It is already hard to practice Thunder Swordplay, but I did not expect Brother Zhao Fu had even acquired its final technique.\"The crowd burst into an uproar after they saw Zhao Fu's swordplay.Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu grew nervous and anxiously looked at Su Mo on the fighting ring.Could Su Mo resist this attack?They doubted he would be able to block such a powerful strike!On the fighting ring, the attack made Su Mo's flesh creep and unprecedented sense of crisis rose in him.This was the most powerful blow he had ever met.Four Spiritual Spirals started to violently vibrate inside him, emitting boundless genuine Qi. The force contained in his flesh was completely released with the rattling sound of his bones. He deflected the oncoming strike.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"Just then, the wind died down and the air became stagnant. Time seemed to have come to a standstill.Nothing but one glaring sword radiance was left. It swiftly transformed into a chilling wind blade, unparalleled and incredible.The wind blade had struck Zhao Fu's Thunder Stab.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The elephant trumpeted, its powerful roar shaking the world.\"What's that? A wild elephant?\"\"It is a Martial Soul! Su Mo's Martial Soul is a wild elephant!\"When the crowd saw the shadow of the mythical elephant on Su Mo's body, they began discussing among themselves.\"What?\"Amid the clanging sound of the two swords, Zhao Fu felt an indescribable force hitting the sword in his hand. He began shaking all over. All the blood Qi in him began flowing against the current and his purlicue ruptured.Swosh!The sword in Zhao Fu's hand was flung away.Su Mo's sword no longer faced any obstacles after he unarmed his opponent.Puff!With his sword radiance gleaming, he guided his sword across Zhao Fu's neck to form a bloody trail.\"Huk\u2026\"Zhao Fu's eyes were round and he choked on the words he wanted to say. Though he wanted to speak, there was a gaping hole in his throat. He could not even say a single word in the end.Thud!His body soon collapsed on the ground like Shen Qing and Ding Tao.Su Mo glanced at Zhao Fu's corpse, a lament growing in his heart.There was no doubt that his opponent was a strong one. If he did not use sword will, it would not have been this simple for him to kill Zhao Fu.Yet Zhao Fu had insisted on having a close combat with him. Was he not digging his own grave?Su Mo had seen a great improvement in his physical force recently, long exceeding 5,000 kg. It was comparable to the force of more than 25 tigers.He could defeat ordinary martial artists in the Peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm and contend against the Lv 3 ones only using his physical force and not his genuine Qi.Not even a Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist could defend against his attack if he coupled it with the double superimposition of his four Spiritual Spirals force.The force of a genuine Qi attack of a Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm was comparable to that of 15 tigers. The rise of each rank came with an increase of the force of 10 tigers, about 2,500 kg.A Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist had the force of about 45 tigers. Even if Zhao Fu was strong, his force was similar to the force of 50 tigers at most.Even if Su Mo's genuine Qi strength was slightly beneath Zhao Fu, the latter was not his match thanks to his physical force of about 25 tigers.The crowd around the arena wore blanked expressions. They seemed a little numb after watching the fight.Su Mo had killed Shen Qing, slashed Ding Tao, and destroyed Zhao Fu. He had completely unleashed his aggressive and tyrannical side.Zhao Fu had said he would kill his opponent within three strikes but the opposite had happened. He ended up getting killed within three strikes.\"Yan Qi, Feng Zilan, why do not you two come up and fight me?\"After killed his opponent, Su Mo scanned the crowd and found Yan Qi and Feng Zilan among them.Those two were now in Su Mo's hit list, especially that Yan Qi, who had repeatedly provoked him. He would not have gone against the Sky Alliance if not for Yan Qi.\"Su Mo, you have killed three of our Sky Alliance disciples! You must pay with your death today! How dare you still be so arrogant!\"Yan Qi shouted, wearing a sneer. Feng Zilan shared his expression.\"You are both talents with Rank 8 Human Class Martial Soul, yet you dare not to fight me who only has a Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul. You are complete trash!\"Su Mo's expression was filled with mockery.Though his Martial Soul had now reached Rank 8, that was his secret. When he entered the Sect, he had only demonstrated his Rank 6 Martial Soul.\"You...!\"Yan Qi and Feng Zilan were speechless, their faces shifting between the colors of red and green.It was true they dared not fight Su Mo. Though they had broken into the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, they were wary of Su Mo, who was capable of killing a Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist.\"Uh?\"A thought suddenly came to Yan Qi.Martial Soul?Why did Su Mo's Martial Soul turn into a wild elephant?Before entering the Gale Island, he had conflicts with Su Mo in the Waterside City. When entering the Sect, he had paid particular attention to Su Mo's Martial Soul.He remembered Su Mo's Martial Soul back then was something that resembled a vortex.But his Martial Soul had actually turned into a wild elephant in the battle just now!That was strange.How was it possible that a Martial Soul changed its form?Confusion plagued Yan Qi until he suddenly thought of something.His eyes widened as he was shocked by his own assumption.He had once heard from senior martial artists that there were special martial artists on the Firmament and Continent who possessed two kinds of Martial Souls at the same time.This phenomenon was dubbed the Twin Martial Souls.Martial artists who possessed Twin Martial Souls were all rare talents.Even if their two Martial Souls were only of Rank 6 or 7 of the Human Class, the martial artists who enjoyed talent beyond that of martial artists with Earth Class Martial Souls.\"Could it be that Su Mo owns Twin Martial Souls?\"Something inside him twisted and contorted.In the entire Skymoon Country, there had never been a single martial artist with Twin Martial Souls.If Su Mo really possessed Twin Martial Souls, then that would be disastrous!\"Impossible! How could he have Twin Martial Souls?\"Yan Qi shook his head, denying the thought.However, it did not matter if Su Mo was truly a martial artist with Twin Martial Souls. His death today was certain.All these thoughts merely passed Yan Qi's mind briefly. He sneered up at Su Mo before shouting at the crowd, \"Senior Brothers of the Sky Alliance, Su Mo has killed three of our own. He's our enemy and we must not let him leave the Decisive Struggle Hall alive today.\"\"This duel today has disgraced our Sky Alliance. If he doesn't die, we will lose our faces. If this news reaches Senior Brother Duan's ears, we'll be hard-pressed to escape punishment.\"\"Let us kill him together!\"Yan Qi's words carried an air of righteousness, inciting the crowd to kill Su Mo together.\"Junior Brother Yan Qi is right. This man is arrogant and dared to kill our Sky Alliance disciples. Unforgivable!\"\"Yes, kill him!\"\"Death to all those who dare challenge the sovereignty of our Sky Alliance!\"\"Let us kill him together!\"The Sky Alliance disciples had long wanted to kill Su Mo and when they heard Yan Qi's words, they reacted immediately.Instantly, more than ten people rushed to the arena.Boom! Boom! Boom!The Sky Alliance disciples all had great cultivations, including those with Lv 3 and Lv 4 cultivations. They were all burning with momentum and rushed up the arena to attack Su Mo.\"Flying Saber Technique!\"\"Mountain-shaking Fist!\"\"Bluecloud Swordplay!\"\"...\"Lights of different hues lit up the sky, raining attacks on Su Mo.\"You are all digging your graves!\"Su Mo's expression turned cold and he used his Shadow Steps to shuffle back and forth in between the gaps of the attacks, leaving behind a trail of shadow.Whoosh!With the flash of his sword radiance, he sliced a Sky Alliance disciple with Lv 3 cultivation.\"Kill!\"Su Mo's killing desire surged with a crazed fervor. He utilized his Shadow Steps to its peak. His sword radiance was continuously lit and sword Qi was everywhere.Pfft!Thud!The Sky Alliance disciples fell one after another with sprays of blood staining the sky, all dead with their souls destroyed.These dead disciples only had Lv 3 cultivation. None of them could take even one strike from Su Mo.Those disciples with Lv 4 cultivation were stronger so he could not kill them instantly. Instead, he tried to avoid their attacks.The arena was now in a complete mess, with blood scattered everywhere.\"Junior Sister Zilan, find some of our Senior Brothers with over Lv 5 cultivation and ask them for help!\"Yan Qi said urgently to Feng Zilan beside him as he watched everything unfolding on the arena. He was still standing under the arena, instead of rushing up.\"Okay!\"Feng Zilan knew the situation had become out of control and immediately turned to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who would dare kill them?Whoosh! Whoosh!With a flurry of noises in the air, more and more disciples of the Sky Alliance flew and entered the fighting ring to join the battle.They were all Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists!Among the audience watching Su Mo's fight against Shen Qing today, Lv 4 martial artists were considered to have the highest cultivation.Those at the Lv 5 or even Lv 6, regarded as the top talented outer disciples, wouldn't even think of watching a fight at this level.\"You people from the Sky Alliance are truly shameless. Any fight on the Decisive Struggle Stage is supposed to be a fair game. Now that I defeated one you, you're all ganging up to kill me.\"Snorting in anger, he moved like a lightning flash and jumped off the fighting ring.He had to back off or he would die a miserable death here.At the moment, there were more than 20 disciples of the Sky Alliance who wanted to fight him and all were Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists.Even if he was powerful and strong, it was impossible for him to win against all these people.Though he killed a dozen people with lower martial strength in a short time just then, the frequent wave-like attacks caught him off guard and caused him some injuries.If not for the brilliance of Shadow Steps allowing him to dodge the attack in time, he would already be seriously injured if not dead.\"You're going nowhere!\"The disciples of the Sky Alliance cried in anger as they jumped off the fighting ring one by one and went after Su Mo.\"Haha! Are you trying to kill me? Ridiculous!\"Wind lifting him from under his feet, he moved so quickly that his figure was a blurry mess. In the blink of an eye, he had already slipped out of the Decisive Struggle Hall.\"Damn it!\"\"Don't let him get away!\"\"Get him\u2026!\"The disciples of the Sky Alliance chased after Su Mo in a line, continuously yelling in rage.A large number of Outer Disciples within the hall also hurried out. There was going to be a good show and they didn't want to miss it.Whoosh!When he stepped out of the hall, Su Mo saw Feng Zilan leading a group of people over to the hall. They blocked his escape path.Everyone in the group wore ice-cold expressions with thick air enveloping them. It wasn't hard to see they were all excellent martial artists at the Lv 5 Spiritual Martial Realm.The group was led by a young elegant man in blue with sharp eyebrows and eyes that gleamed like stars.\"You're Su Mo?\"The young man glanced at Su Mo, his voice cold.\"Oh God, it's Senior Brother Yi Xiaoguang!\"\"Senior Brother Yi Xiaoguang, one of the top ten Outer Disciples! He ranks the seventh!\"\"Senior Brother Yi is here! Su Mo's done for!\"Many Outer Disciples were shocked to see the young man.They started looking at Su Mo with sympathy.Su Mo frowned when he heard what the crowd was saying.This young man was the seventh among the Top Ten Outer Disciples?It was said that all of the Top Ten Outer Disciples were excellent martial artists who had reached the Peak Lv 6 Spiritual Martial Realm. There was no way he could defeat any of them.He didn't respond and there was vigilance in his eyes.\"Cheers to Senior Brother Yi!\"The rest of the disciples of the Sky Alliance were so thrilled to see Yi Xiaoguang that they couldn't wait to step forward and salute him.\"Senior Brother Yi, this is Su Mo. He's the one who killed more than ten of our Sky Alliance brothers. What he has done can never be forgiven!\"One Sky Alliance disciple chimed in.Yi Xiaoguang nodded, coldness creeping into his eyes. He said indifferently, \"Su Mo, end your own life!\"Yi Xiaoguang's voice was overbearing as if nobody could refuse his order.\"End my own life?\"Su Mo squinted and sneered. \"Why would I do that?\"\"Only death awaits anyone who kills one of us!\"Yi Xiaoguang's expression was one of pride. He shook his head and said, \"I don't want to kill you so you end this yourself! I'll leave your corpse intact!\"\"If I say no?\"Su Mo sounded solid and firm.\"You don't have that say in front of me!\"Yi Xiaoguang shook his head and said haughtily, \"You have 40 seconds to decide before I make my move.\"\"According to the sect rules of Gale Island, disciples are strictly forbidden from killing each other. You dare kill me?\" Su Mo asked.\"Haha!\"Yi Xiaoguang ridiculed and his expression overflowing with arrogance. \"There is no difference between ending your life and killing an ant, so Sect would do nothing to me even I kill you!\"Gale Island thought highly of him as he was one of the Top Ten Outer disciples.Even if he actually killed Su Mo, they wouldn't punish him too severely for just a mere Outer Disciple.\"Kill myself? Impossible!\"Su Mo sneered, sighing coldly. \"Even if I'm to die, I'd rather die in a battle with dignity rather than killing myself like a coward!\"\"Fine! I'll help you!\"Yi Xiaoguang nodded flatly.He cupped his hand into a fist and there was genuine Qi circling around it, shooting out a dazzling light.Su Mo's expression was immeasurably solemn. An attack coming from a martial artist at the Peak Lv 6 Spiritual Martial Realm should be incredibly powerful!Besides, for the Top Ten Outer Disciples to distinguish themselves from thousands of other Outer Disciples, their strength must overwhelmingly exceed those of the average Lv 6 martial artists who had reached their Peak.\"I only used 30 percent of my strength in this punch, but that's enough to kill you!\"Laughing heartily, Yi Xiaoguang gradually lifted his fist and hurled his punch at his opponent with a booming sound.A thick white beam of light emerged from his fist like a bursting sacred ray and was thrown at Su Mo as quick as a flash of lightning.Hum! Hum!Wherever the white light beam touched, space trembled and was seemingly about to collapse. The light beam was full of destructive force.Huff!Su Mo shouted when he saw the light beam was about to hit himself and his four Spiritual Spiral began spinning furiously. The radiance coming off his long sword emerged brilliantly to directly meet his opponent's light beam.\"Final Hit of Heavenly Wind!\"Boom!When the sword radiance hit the light beam, a huge explosion shook the entire place.The destructive shock waves from the explosion swept the place, causing some of the weaker disciples to take a step backward and vomit blood.Pfft!Being the target, there wasn't any way for Su Mo to block the light beam. He took the hit squarely on his body and was flung hundreds of meters away. He coughed out blood that rose from within him like a speeding arrow.Thud!He landed heavily on the ground. He tasted something in the back of his throat and once again spat a mouthful of blood.At the moment, his face was a pale as a sheet of white paper. His shirt had always been torn into pieces from the explosion, exposing his bronze skin.\"Su Mo!\"\"Senior Brother Su Mo!\"Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu were frightened and about to step forward to help Su Mo back on his feet.Su Mo waved his hand at them, stopping them in their tracks. He then struggled to get up.Cough! Cough! Cough!Su Mo couldn't stop coughing and the blood kept trickling down from his mouth.He was heavily injured and his internal organs were damaged. In fact, he wouldn't have survived without his solid and strong body.\"So that's all a Top Ten Outer Disciple got!\"Su Mo held his head up and looked directly at Yi Xiaoguang, wearing a contemptuous smile on his face.The latter raised his eyebrows and said with surprise, \"Not bad! Not bad at all! It's a miracle someone with the cultivation of the Peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm can take 30 percent of my fist strength and still live!\"Still, you're going to hell today!\"\"Bring it on!\"Su Mo shouted loud, standing straight with pride and dignity.\"Die!\"Yi Xiaoguang bawled out, once again firing his white light beam. The beam made a hole in the sky and his punch this time was twice as powerful as his previous one.If there was no interference, this strike would definitely send Su Mo to his deathbed.Su Mo sighed silently as he stared at the white light that was about to strike him. Why was the person still not showing up?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs one of the Outer Disciples, Yi Xiaoguang was more powerful than Su Mo.Even if he used only 30% of his strength, Su Mo would not be able to take the blow.Let alone this powerful blow.Buzz!The power from the white beam was very great and Su Mo would be struck by it at any moment.With his eyes red and increased sword momentum, Su Mo was ready to use the power of the sword will.He knew that even with the power of the sword will, he was no match for Yi Xiaoguang, but he might be able to survive the blow.At this instance, a black figure suddenly appeared before Su Mo.Upon seeing the black figure, Su Mo heaved a sigh of relief.He was safe.The black figure stood in front of Su Mo. With a wave of his hand, the white beam instantly disappeared like snow melting in the spring without a trace.\"Elder Wang?\"The sudden change of events took Yi Xiaoguang by surprise. He frowned upon seeing the person who stood in front of Su Mo.The black figure was the young Outer Elder, Wang Hui.He was Su Mo's Senior Brother.\"Yi Xiaoguang, let the matter drop!\" said Wang Hui, looking at Yi Xiaoguang.Upon hearing that, Yi Xiaoguang raised his eyebrows and coldly asked, \"Elder Wang, this guy has killed more than 10 members of our Sky Alliance, and you want me to let the matter drop?\"\"It's a known fact, on the stage of Life and Death, everyone has agreed to put his life at stake!\"Wang Hui shook his head and said, \"Are you telling me that the Sky Alliance are sore losers? So embarrassing!\"\"You...!\"Yi Xiaoguang became speechless and his face turned grave. He shouted, \"Anyway, this guy has to die!\"Immediately after saying this, Yi Xiaoguang's figure flickered and he started to attack Su Mo again.\"Outrageous!\"Wang Hui shouted as his face changed. He sent a blow at Yi Xiaoguang. It was a huge Palm Print, which was extremely powerful.Boom!The Palm Print not only directly counteracted Yi Xiaoguang's attack but also landed heavily on his body.\"Uhh!\"Yi Xiaoguang was shocked and thrown backward dozens of meters. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.\"Wang Hui, are you determined to protect this small fry?\" Yi Xiaoguang shouted.He was very furious. Never had he thought that Su Mo meant so much to Wang Hui.\"I've been merciful to you even though you showed no respect to me. If you still don't come to your senses, I'll have no qualms about killing you!\"Wang Hui's face was expressionless and he exerted the authority of an elder.\"You\u2026 Well! All right! You win!\"Yi Xiaoguang's face turned blue.Being one of the Top 10 Outer Disciples and a member of the Sky Alliance, Yi Xiaoguang had a bright future in front of him. He had never had to put up with anyone, as even those ordinary Outer Elders were respectful to him whenever they saw him.However, Yi Xiaoguang was a little bit afraid of Wang Hui.Not only was Wang Hui an Outer Elder with unfathomable strength, but also he was Elder Wei's disciple. If he continued to oppose him, Wang Hui might kill him.\"Wang Hui, I'll put this matter aside for the moment. But I'll definitely report this to my Senior Brother Duan when he comes back from his cultivation. There's no way I'm going to let the matter rest!\" Yi Xiaoguang said as he looked at him darkly and grit his teeth.His gaze instantly fell on Su Mo, who was standing behind Wang Hui. With a wry smile, he said, \"Su Mo, you will die at the hands of the Sky Alliance. No one can protect you!\"After saying this, Yi Xiaoguang turned around and left.The members of the Sky Alliance looked ghastly. No one had expected Wang Hui to show up.Since Yi Xiaoguang had left, there was no reason for them to stay on, so they left as well.\"Su Mo, how are you?\"\"Senior Brother Su, are you OK?\"After the disciples of the Sky Alliance had left, Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu immediately rushed up to Su Mo and asked him.\"Don't worry, I'm fine!\"Su Mo forced out a smile to reassure them.Immediately, Su Mo turned to Wang Hui and said, \"Thank you, Senior\u2026!\"Before Su Mo could finish his sentence, Wang Hui interrupted him and said, \"It's better for you to have your injury treated! After you've recuperated, come and look for me.\"Having said that, Wang Hui left.\"Uh!\"Su Mo was stunned. Since he could not do anything, he left with Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu toward their abode.The crowd dispersed as well.After the crowd had dispersed, news about the incident at the Decisive Struggle Hall spread quickly through the entire Outer Gate.Su Mo, the new disciple, had killed more than 10 members of the Sky Alliance at the Decisive Struggle Hall!There was an uproar in the Outer Gate!After Duan Jingtian gloriously defeated Jin Yang, his reputation went up. Unexpectedly, someone killed members of the Sky Alliance and that was a hard slap in Duan Jingtian's face!Su Mo was well-known in the entire Outer Gate. Before long, everybody knew him.Regardless of what was happening outside, Su Mo went back to his room.He slowly sat down with a heavily injured body.He was terribly hurt. His internal organs were badly injured and three of his ribs were broken.\"Yi Xiaoguang, you'll die in my hands one day!\" the furious Su Mo said.After he calmed himself down, he began to treat his injuries.Su Mo had lots of healing elixirs. They were the rewards from his earlier tasks.He picked out a bottle of healing elixir and swallowed some. Then Su Mo started to refine the efficacy of the elixir to help him to recover.Time passed quickly.In the twinkle of an eye, one month had passed.A cloud permeated the cliff with the clouds folding and unfolding.A young man in green stood in the midst of the fog, holding a longsword embedded with a blue gem.Stepping, Qi operating, hands shaking, and sword drawing\u2014every movement he made was smooth and steady.The strokes displayed by the young man were simple. Those were the basic movements.He kept stroking and increasing the speed of his strokes. And in no time, he had displayed uncountable strokes.After a long while, the young man stopped and stood with his sword.\"Even though these are basic strokes and they're not powerful, they brought my understanding towards the sword techniques to a higher level!\"Su Mo smiled and said to himself.The swordplay that he was cultivating was of the Lower Lv 3. As the foundation of his swordplay was very weak, no matter how he practiced, there was a barrier that he was unable to break through.Thus, Su Mo had been practicing basic swordplay for the past few days to have a better understanding of the sword.Apparently, although he did not increase in strength, Su Mo was much more comfortable with his swordplay and it was like second nature to him.\"It's time for me to go to Senior Brother since I've almost recovered.\"Su Mo mumbled and left the cliff.It must have been a severe injury for Su Mo to take one whole month to recuperate.Previously, Wang Hui had told Su Mo to look for him after he had recuperated. He had wanted to thank Wang Hui for saving his life as well.\"Look, that's Su Mo!\"\"That's the traitor! He's so audacious to kill the people of the Sky Alliance!\"\"He looks so ordinary! I don't think he's as good as what others have said!\"As Su Mo walked on the street, some of the disciples who knew Su Mo started to gossip about him.Su Mo smiled bitterly. He had become the hot topic of the Outer Gate!Everywhere he went, there would be people who recognized him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don't be courteous.\"Wang Hui gave a casual wave. \"How are your injuries?\"\"They're nearly healed!\" Su Mo answered.\"That's good!\"Wang Hui nodded and gave Su Mo a once-over before laughing. \"Junior Brother, you really surprised me!\"He grinned and said, \"You entered the Peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm in such a short time and managed to kill Lv 3 and Lv 4 warriors like they're nothing. You're extraordinary indeed!\"Wang Hui had been watching all of Su Mo's battles in the Decisive Struggle Hall and was incredibly impressed by his strength.But he couldn't help sighing even as he doled out compliments.If Su Mo's Martial Soul wasn't so poor, his future achievements would definitely be remarkable!What a shame!\"You're too courteous with your compliments. I was just lucky!\"Su Mo gave a humble smile.\"In battles, a victory is a victory. There's no such thing as luck. You don't have to be humble.\"Spending the next few minutes in deep thought, Wang Hui continued, \"Master is in seclusion and won't be coming out in a short time, maybe not until we hold the Outer Disciple Competition this year in a few months' time. If you have any question on martial arts, you can come directly to me.\"\"Sure,\" Su Mo said, nodding.\"Another thing. Don't tell others you're Master's disciple.\"Wang Hui sighed, changing the topic.\"Why?\"Su Mo was curious why he couldn't mention that he was a disciple of Elder Wei.\"Master said you're only his unofficial disciple. He'll only accept you as his pro-disciple if you can rank within the top 10 Outer Gate disciples in three years.\"After a moment of silence, he continued, \"If you can't make it in three years, he'll strip you off the title of his unofficial disciple.\"\"This is a crucial test for you. I hope you won't let Master down.\"Su Mo was silent. He understood what Wang Hui meant. If he couldn't rank in the top 10 within three years, then that was proof that he was a mere mediocre person.An influential figure like Elder Wei would definitely not accept a mediocre person as a disciple.Su Mo nodded, smiled confidently. \"Senior Brother, don't worry. I don't need three years. I'll surely rank within top 10 in the Outer Disciple Competition this year.\"\"Really?\"Wang Hui raised his eyebrow and shook his head. \"It's good to have confidence but don't be arrogant!\"He obviously didn't believe Su Mo was capable of doing so.If Su Mo wanted to do that, he would need at least a Lv 6 cultivation for it to be possible.At the moment, Su Mo was only at Peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm and there were only three to four moments left before the competition this year.Even if he was talented, there was no way he could make the drastic leap to Lv 6 in such a short time.Su Mo smiled bitterly without replying. Whether or not he could achieve it, he would let the outcome speak for themselves.He chatted with Wang Hui for a while longer, asking for his advice on cultivation, before excusing himself.After leaving Wang Hui's residence, he walked toward the Contribution Palace of the Sect.There were still plenty of money and objects on him that he hadn't exchanged for contribution points.At the contribution palace, he converted all his scrolls, weapons, and spiritual herbs into contribution points.Scrolls and weapons were useless to him and he didn't need any of the spiritual herbs either.With enough contribution points, he could exchange for some elixirs. That would be so much better than directly consuming the spiritual herbs.He only kept 80,000 out of his 780,000 pieces of gold, exchanging the rest for contribution points.In total, he exchanged for 5,936 contribution points.Though he had already estimated he would have plenty of contribution points after this large-scale exchange, he was nevertheless shocked.His spoils this time were mostly of Medium Lv 2. They were better than what he got from the Qingyuan Trial Test, so their value also doubled.He then went to the pharmacy to buy five bottles of Motivating Energy Elixirs and two bottles of Spirit-Recovering Pills.The former was to improve his cultivation and the latter to heal and cure injuries. They were both Lv 2 elixirs.They were typically expensive.The seven bottles, each containing 15 pills, cost him about 3,200 contribution points.He then went to exchange 100 Soul Crystals of Class 4 Lv 2 Beast Souls with 2,500 contribution points.Together, they cost him 5,700 contribution points in total.Su Mo sighed. Everything was too expensive! No matter how many points he had, it wouldn't be enough for him to use!It didn't occur to him what he bought far exceeded his martial arts level.For instance, Medium Lv 2 Elixirs were usually used by Middle-Level martial artists. He was merely at the lower Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm.Of course, he would find the prices highly unaffordable.When he was done with his exchanges, he saw that he needed nothing else and returned to his residence.Boom!Inside his room, Su Mo released his Devouring Martial Spirit and it started devouring the Beast Souls one by one.Very soon, it devoured all the 100 souls he exchanged for but remained unchanging at the Rank 8 Human Class.\"I need more and more Beast Souls to advance my Martial Soul! I wonder when will I have a Martial Soul of the Rank 9 Human Class!\"Su Mo sighed, fishing out a bottle of Motivating Energy Elixir.His cultivation had stayed put for over a month, signaling that it was incredibly steady now.Time to charge for the Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm!The elixir melted the moment it entered his mouth and a huge amount of Spiritual Qi started spinning madly inside his body. His Martial Soul kept taking the Spiritual Qi in. With this combination, his cultivation rapidly advanced.His cultivation soon reached the critical point of the Peak Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm, rushing toward Lv 3.Su Mo felt as serene as still water. He tried his best to activate his Primordial Genuine Qi, invoking Grand Circulation of genuine Qi again and again.Simultaneously, he had a Motivating Energy Elixir in his hand so he could consume in time in the case where he lacked genuine Qi.Time trickled by.The night was so peaceful. The still water ran deep and the full moon rose high in the sky, its glow pouring on every inch of earth.Su Mo's backyard was submerged in a pin-drop silence.A breeze swept the trees, sending them swaying.In the moment, within a hundred meters radius around Su Mo's room, the Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth became lively.Overhead, the sky was changing rapidly with wild clouds and gusts. The Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth was like elves of wind, dancing around the room and sinking down, forming the shape of a large funnel.Whoosh\u2026The drastic change of Spiritual Qi caused a change in the airflow. The gentle breeze became wild gusts, sweeping off the ground, flying sand and rolling pebbles.The gusts quieted down and the Spiritual Qi calmed down after some time. Everything went back to normal.Inside his room, Su Mo opened his eyes.Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Considering how fast he was progressing, it wouldn't be a problem for him to advance to the Lv 5 or even Lv 6 within six months.After taking a rest, he drew out another Motivating Energy Elixir and swallowed it. He then summoned his Martial Soul to absorb the Spiritual Qi.The elixir was a Medium Lv 2 Elixir. It was an incredibly potent pill. He didn't dare to consume too many at once and only swallowed them one by one.The effects of the elixir merged with the Spiritual Qi absorbed by his Martial Soul, forming an imaginary shadow of a baby elephant and gradually strengthened his physical body.In the following month, he didn't accept any missions and chose to stay on the island to stabilize his cultivation.Over the span of the month, he cultivated his Elephant's Strength Skill to strengthen his physical body at night. During the day, he practiced his body movements and swordsmanship.He used up nearly all the Motivating Energy Elixirs he owned within that time, finally improving his physical body and pushing his Lv 4 of the Elephant's Strength Skill to its final peak. The skill was now close to the Completion Realm of Lv 4.Now, he only needed his physical force to defeat the most Peak Lv 3 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artists.In terms of his martial arts techniques, his Divine Wind Swordplay had also seen a tremendous progression and was moving toward the peak of the Great Completion.Shadow Steps was what he practiced the most within the month. It was now about to achieve the Great Completion.His single step forward would now be accompanied by many untraceable residual shadows. It was incredible how fast the shadows were.Then there was his Nine Rapier Movements of Wind Devil. It was rather easy to practice that as it was a Medium Lv 2 Martial Skill. In that month, he had practiced all the nine techniques of the swordsmanship to the peak of the Great Completion.Its power wasn't all that much weaker than his Divine Wind Swordplay.Knock! Knock! Knock!While he was cultivating in the divided room, he heard a series of knock on the door and Li Feng's voice.\"Su Mo, you in?\"\"What's up, Li Feng?\"Su Mo asked with a smile, having opened the door to see Li Feng and Niu Xiaohu outside.\"Something big happened! Let's hurry and go to the mission palace!\" Li Feng said hastily.\"Something big? What is it?\" Su Mo asked in confusion.\"It's war! The Ironforest Country is waging war against us!\" Niu Xiaohu said.\"War?\"Su Mo was shocked.\"That's right. The war began a few days ago. I heard the mission palace had announced the national war mission,\" Li Feng said, nodding.\"National war mission?\"Stunned, Su Mo said, \"Let's go take a look at the mission palace!\"When they reached the outer gate of the mission place, they were shocked by the crowd outside. It was so packed that it was impossible to move around.With at least 3,000 Outer Disciples at the mission palace, the atmosphere there was incredibly heated.\"I'll be joining the war in the southern frontier. Are you guys going?\"\"Such a large-scale war is too dangerous!\"\"No risk, no return. They're offering such great rewards. How can I miss it!\"Many were discussing among themselves, some looking rather excited.Su Mo became incredibly intrigued after hearing the discussions, but the mission place was too packed and no one could enter.Just then, he saw a disciple dressed in purple barely managing to squeeze out of the mission palace. He walked up to him and asked, \"Junior Brother, what's the national war announcement about?\"The disciple dressed in purple was only of Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm cultivation. That was why he addressed him as Junior Brother.\"Su Mo!\"The disciple's eyes gleamed when he saw Su Mo. He seemed pleasantly surprised.\"Uh?\"Su Mo was stunned. Why did the disciple look so happy to see him?\"Eh?\"Noticing how familiar the disciple seemed, he finally recognized him after a moment's contemplation.Zhou Xin!It was the kid he saved in the Qingyuan Trial Test.Su Mo remembered him to be a strong-willed person with a firm martial arts will. He was someone worthy of befriending.\"It's been a while, Zhou Xin!\" Su Mo smiled.\"Senior Brother Su, we've only joined Gale Island for a short few months but your name has already been spread wide and far. You're amazing!\"Zhou Xin's expression appeared rather cautious.\"Those are just rumors, heh!\"Shaking his head, Su Mo said, \"Zhou Xin, you've just left the mission palace. What's going on?\"\"Senior Brother Su, the rewards for this national war mission are incredibly appealing. I'll tell you all about it.\"Zhou Xin nodded and continued, \"Six days ago, the southern Ironforest Country dispatched 800,000 soldiers via eight routes and invaded our Skymoon Country. They're invincible and have captured 17 cities.\"The Skymoon royals have dispatched a million-strong army to the war zone and also asked the four sects for help at the same time. Thus, the Gale Island has announced the national war mission. Any Outer Disciple of the Spiritual Martial Realm can participate.\"The rewards are incredibly hefty. If you kill an enemy in the Qi Cultivation Realm, you can obtain five contribution points. If you kill an enemy at the Lv 1 Spiritual Martial Realm, you can get 10 points, and 20 if you kill one at the Lv 2 Spiritual Martial Realm. The rewards double with each level. Finally, you can claim your reward with the head of an Ironforest Country martial artist!\"Zhou Xin's explanation was very detailed as he relayed the national war mission to Su Mo.\"Such a generous reward?\"Su Mo's eyes gleamed. With his current strength, he could kill the martial artists at the Lv 3 or Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm with ease.If killing a Lv 4 Spiritual Martial Realm martial artist would give him 80 contribution points, then killing 100 of them would give him 8,000 points.What if he killed 1,000 of them?At this thought, Su Mo couldn't hold back his excitement.\"Senior Brother Su, I'll be participating in this mission! Are you going? I'll go with you if you are.\" Zhou Xin asked in anticipation.\"Of course! This is such a good opportunity!\"There was nothing to hold Su Mo back.\"Great! Then I'll be teaming with you.\"Zhou Xin was incredibly happy. It was extremely dangerous to participate in this kind of mission. With an expert like Su Mo, it would be so much safer.\"Are you going, Li Feng and Xiaohu?\" Su Mo asked the two people beside him.Li Feng had long entered the Spiritual Martial Realm and Niu Xiaohu had also recently made it.The reason why the latter could advance so quickly was thanks to the two Motivating Energy Elixirs that Su Mo gave him.Though both Li Feng and Xiaohu were now martial artists of the Spiritual Martial Realm, the war zone was too dangerous. He still needed to ask for their opinion.\"Brother Su Mo, I'm coming with you!\"Niu Xiaohu said firmly without needing to think.He had great confidence in Su Mo's strength. With Su Mo around, he felt very safe.\"I'm coming as well. I've been wanting to meet martial artists from other countries and see how strong they are!\" Li Feng said, smiling.\"Okay, let's go back and pack. We'll meet at the pier in two hours!\" Su Mo said, his voice loud and clear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warrior\u2019s PromiseCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the southern frontier of Skymoon Country, flames of war raged everywhere.The armies of Ironforest Country and Skymoon Country had already fought dozens of battles with ups and downs on both sides. The war situation was temporarily at a\u00a0stalemate.Ironforest Country was Skymoon Country's neighboring country to the south. It not only had the population of hundreds of millions but also a stronger national power than Skymoon Country had.At this time, it assembled an army of 800,000 to attack Skymoon Country. Ironforest Country's army was divided into eight groups and they marched along different routes. Skymoon Country was caught unprepared for that kind of assault. Nothing could stop it. Soon, Ironforest Country occupied dozens of Skymoon Country's cities.As one of the magnificent cities in the southern frontier of Skymoon Country, Guanwu City was 25 kilometers in both length and breadth, and millions of people lived there.Senior General Mo Tie of Ironforest Country led an army of 100,000, which was sweeping forward from victory to victory, and arrived at this city.To defend themselves against Ironforest Country's attack, Skymoon Country also stationed an army of 100,000 there.At noon, in the shining sunshine, four dusty young men rode war horses and approached the northern gate of Guanwu City.\"Here we are!\"At the gate, looking at the magnificent city in front of them, the four people were very excited.These four people were Su Mo and others.After journeying for dozens of days, they finally arrived at Guanwu City.Ironforest Country's army was divided into eight groups marching to attack Skymoon Country. And Guanwu City was just one of the cities that they attacked.Therefore, Su Mo and others chose this city as their destination.Looking at the towering city wall in front of him, a solemn gleam came into Su Mo's eyes.The city wall of Guanwu City was over 30 meters high and completely built by diamond rocks.But now, the towering wall had already fallen into ruins. Many parts of it were broken, and some parts were just repaired.Meanwhile, the startling, dry purplish-black blood was covering the whole city wall.It was obvious that this city had just experienced a great war\u2014an extremely tragic war.\"Let's go! Let's go to the city!\"Su Mo called out and they rode toward the city gate.\"Who is it? Get off the horse and be checked!\"At the gate stood dozens of guards. After seeing Su Mo and the others, one of the guard leaders shouted to them.Su Mo nodded his head and was just about to get off. Suddenly, the sound of hooves came from behind him at that moment.He turned around and saw a group of seven or eight young people. They galloped at a high speed and rushed directly to the city gate.\"Stop!\"Seeing that this group of people was about to dart into the city, the guard leader suddenly cried angrily and quickly stopped them in front of the gate.\"We're the Scorching Sun Sect's disciples. Do you dare to stop us? Go away!\"On a galloping war horse, a tall youth coldly grunted and threw a punch to beat the guard leader away.Immediately, dust was rising from all directions and those people quickly rode into Guanwu City.\"Scorching Sun Sect's disciples? How arrogant they are!\" Li Feng said angrily.666\"Those who are arrogant may not live long. I wish they could survive in the coming war!\"Su Mo shook his head and smiled.As Skymoon Country's royal family asked the four Sects for help, it was certain that the four sects would send disciples to enter the war. So the purpose of these people was exactly the same as theirs.However, their behavior made Su Mo have an unfavorable attitude toward the Scorching Sun Sect's disciples.There was war happening right now, so it made sense that the guards checked the identities of the people entering the city to prevent any spies from Ironforest Country.But these Scorching Sun Sect's disciples relied on their identities of Sect disciples to act so capriciously.Su Mo shook his head. Then they went up and took out their jade identification badges of Gale Island to enter the city.Even on the wide street, which was bustling in its former days, there was nobody in sight at this time, and the whole city was full of the repressive atmosphere before the storm.After entering Guanwu City, they went directly to the Mansion of the City Governor.The Mansion of the City Governor in Guanwu City occupied an area of a thousand acres. It stood in the center of the city just like a giant castle.Su Mo and the others showed their identities before the castle, and a young guard led them into it.\"Everyone, our city governor has already arranged rooms for every Sect disciple. Please follow me,\" the guard said.666\"Brother, do you know how many disciples of the four Sects have already come to Guanwu City?\" Li Feng asked the guard.666\"In these few days, there have been over 300 Sect disciples arriving in the city. Among them, most are from the Scorching Sun Sect and the Sky Yuan Sect. Disciples from the Sky Rapier Sect and Gale Island are rather few,\" replied the guard.666\"How is the war situation?\" Su Mo asked.\"Alas! Not optimistic!\"This guard sighed and replied with a serious look. \"Ironforest Country's army has already organized three attacks, which got stronger and stronger. And 40 percent of our army of 100,000 stationed in the city is already gone!\"\"40 percent?\" Su Mo and the others sniffed in consternation. Losing 40 percent of the force meant 40,000 soldiers had died in the war.\"In such a short time, Skymoon Country actually had such a big loss?\"\"Luckily, Ironforest Country was not better than us. They also lost over 30,000 people,\" the guard said.Su Mo nodded. It made sense that each side in the war had losses. If only Skymoon Country suffered such a heavy loss, while Ironforest Country did not, then there was no doubt that Skymoon Country would fail.At that time, even the four Sects would not allow it. And they would not just send Outer Disciples to assist them.Because the entire Skymoon Country was actually the country of the four Sects. Even the royal family was just their puppet.If the four Sects wanted to, they were truly able to change the royal family and dynasties.From this point of view, Ironforest Country was similar to Skymoon Country.However, the difference was that Ironforest Country did not have the four Sects, which caused a strength dispersion. In their country, they only had the Ulti-mystery Sect, the strongest Sect in Ironforest Country.The Ulti-mystery Sect was the overlord of the entire Ironforest Country, which meant that it occupied a dominant role in the country.In other words, the war between Ironforest Country and Skymoon Country was, in fact, a war between the Ulti-mystery Sect and the four Sects.It was not the first war between the two countries. Actually, every three years they made a small battle and every five years they started a big war.The war was normally between the two countries' ordinary troops. It already had a rule that only martial artists that were under the True Spirit Realm could join the war.After all, martial artists above the True Spirit Realm were the top strong ones in both countries. Once they joined the war, the losses would be immeasurable, and both sides were unable to bear the consequences.As long as the two countries did not play really hard, they generally did not dispatch the True Spirit Realm martial artists.Su Mo and the others followed this guard and came to a courtyard after a little while.\"There are many rooms here, so you can stay! Servants will come to give you food and water!\"The guard took them to that place, then turned around and went back.They entered the courtyard and chose a room to stay respectively.\"Su Mo, we're going to walk around in the Mansion of the City Governor. Will you join us?\"Li Feng, Niu Xiaohu, and Zhou Xin came to Su Mo's room and asked him.\"No, I'll pass. You three go!\"Su Mo thought for a while, and then he shook his head.The fourth realm of his Elephant's Strength Skill had been almost completed at this moment, and the strength of his body had greatly increased. He could not wait to attempt to condense the fifth Spiritual Spiral.\"Fine! In that case, we'll go!\"After they left, Su Mo sat down and silently operated Nine Spirals Mystique to condense the fifth Spiritual Spiral.Time trickled by.In the room, with the condensation of the Spiritual Spiral, Su Mo's face gradually became hideous with great pain.\"Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!\"After another hour, a mist of blood suddenly appeared from Su Mo's body and his clothes were dyed red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
