Plop.His gaze headed toward the yard.\u2018We need to make a snowman family!\u2019Quite a few snowmen were made at Raon\u2019s excited shout.The snowmen who were made with the first snow were still maintaining their form after multiple repairs. Based on what he had heard, Raon checked on the snowmen first thing in the morning as soon as he opened his eyes.Choi Han confirmed that his snowman was among the snowman family before walking into the building.\u2018It\u2019s calm.\u2019The inside of the building was warm and calm.It was quiet.\u201cNo.\u201dIt was calm but not quiet.It wasn\u2019t loud, but voices as clear and bouncy as the sound of a xylophone could faintly be heard from the kitchen.\u201cHey Beacrox, hey Beacrox.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bored!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bored too, nya!\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaa.\u201d\u201cI want to help make the cookies!\u201d\u201cI can knead dough very well, nya!\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaaaaaaaaa\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe corners of Choi Han\u2019s lips oddly curled up.It was because he was not too familiar with this kind of calmness.The Forest of Darkness becomes calm in the winter.It was to the point that it could seem peaceful at a glance.However, that was just like looking at the surface of a lake without being able to see beneath it.The weak animals in the Forest of Darkness moved extremely cautiously in the winter, to the point that they didn\u2019t dare to make any noises.Making any noise would catch the attention of a predator, who would be roaming for food as their source of food had decreased.It was calm, but\u2026 Blood was shed, screams were heard, and the hidden Choi Han could hear the sound of the predators eating despite not wanting to hear it.Whenever he heard that noise, Choi Han had to clench his stomach that wanted to growl from hunger but could not go out to look for food because he was worried that he would die. Choi Han thought that his extremely weak self of the past was pitiful.Of course, he figured out how to survive the winter in the Forest of Darkness at some point and his sword arts improved to the point that he could make it through the winters.However, he still had to hear the things within that calmness year after year.\u201cHey Beacrox, hey Beacrox. Can I really not try kneading the dough?\u201d\u201cI want to though, nya\u2026\u2026\u201dThis calmness and the calmness of that time were fundamentally different.Both periods of time were more peaceful and quieter than other seasons, but the things within them were completely different.\u201cMeeeeeow.\u201dChoi Han smiled while watching the grey kitten come down from the second floor. Ron was coming down the stairs with On.\u201cWhere\u2019s Cale-nim?\u201dOn smacked the top of Choi Han\u2019s foot for no reason after hearing that question and commented almost in a sigh.\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping, nya.\u201dChoi Han looked at Ron. Ron had an empty plate in his hand as he nodded his head with a cold gaze. The smile was gone from Choi Han\u2019s face as he nodded back.The two of them didn\u2019t need to talk to understand each other.\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping so much, nya.\u201dChoi Han opened his arms toward On to show his agreement to her shocked mumbling. On jumped into Choi Han\u2019s arms and shook her head side to side.\u2018He really does sleep a lot.\u2019Choi Han had not put much thought into it when Cale said that he was going to rest in this villa. He thought it was normal for Cale to rest since he went through so much.That was why at first, he watched Cale and wondered how someone could move so little while just sleeping and eating all day.However, he thought that Cale would not be like this after a few days.\u2018But Cale-nim was different, as expected.\u2019Cale was like this past a few days all the way until the last day of the year.In some ways he was truly unchanging and shocking.\u201cBut he has at least gained a little bit of weight, nya.\u201dChoi Han gently smiled as On looked at him while making that comment.Cale\u2019s pale complexion had gotten a bit better.He also seemed to be eating well as he gained some weight. However, he was still skinnier than when Choi Han first met him but at least he looked better.Cale especially looked at peace when he was basically lying down on a chair and eating fruit.Choi Han walked toward the kitchen with Ron and On.\u201cAnd the Wolves?\u201dChoi Han slightly shrugged his shoulders at Beacrox\u2019s comment with a stoic gaze.\u201cThey\u2019re going to train a bit more first.\u201dBeacrox slightly nodded his head. Choi Han quietly chuckled after noticing that Beacrox\u2019s movements as he kneaded the dough for the snack bread had become a bit faster.\u201cWhat?\u201dBeacrox scowled at Choi Han but Choi Han simply snorted, as if that vicious gaze was not scary at all.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201d\u201cHey Beacrox, is it hard to knead the dough? I\u2019m right here. My front paws are strong.\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dRaon shoved his chubby front paws toward Beacrox but Beacrox did his best to ignore him. Ron was watching this with interest.Ron then started washing the empty dishes and On jumped out of Choi Han\u2019s arms to walk to Ron with a dry cloth.Many different noises could be heard, but none of them were loud and everybody was speaking quieter than usual for some reason.\u2018It\u2019s probably because Cale-nim is sleeping.\u2019Choi Han liked this calmness.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about having a feast tonight for dinner.\u201d\u201cWow! Beacrox, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the best, nya!\u201d\u201cI want to help, nya.\u201dChoi Han listened to the warm conversation and thought that it was the first time he spent the last day of the year like this. He was sure he had a time like this in the past, but it was so long ago that his memories were faint.It almost made him a bit sad thinking about it, but he was subconsciously smiling because he liked this warmth.Choi Han turned his head. He looked toward the stairs leading up to the second floor.Maybe it was because it was the last day of the year, but he couldn\u2019t help but be thankful toward the person who created such a moment, the central figure who allowed them to all be together.And the person at the center of that gratitude opened his closed eyes.\u201c\u2026Haaa.\u201dHe could hear energetic shouts through the window at the end of the room that was slightly open for ventilation.\u201cHow disgusting.\u201dThe Wolf children were still training despite it being the last day of the year.\u201cScary little punks.\u201d\u2018How much stronger are they planning on getting?! Are they trying to get strong enough to break boulders or something?\u2026Actually, they might already be able to break boulders.\u2019Cale got chills on his back thinking about that fearful thought that came into his mind.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dHe rolled his body over and extended his body all over the bed.\u201cMan, they\u2019re so loud.\u201dWhether it was inside or outside, one side was loud whenever the other side was quiet. If one side seemed chaotic, the other side calmed down a bit. This repeated over and over.Everybody in the villa must have gone to the first floor as it seemed bustling but quiet, but in return, the outside of the villa was chaotic with fierce sounds of training as if they were celebrating the last day of the year by training even harder.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s different.\u201dCale slowly closed his eyes.Although he didn\u2019t want to remember it, memories of his past came above the surface and flashed through his mind like scenes out of a movie whenever he was calm like this.Cale couldn\u2019t help but recall a certain day of rest.* * *That day was the day that after not taking a single day off for a whole year, Kim Rok Soo said that he was going to take a day off.\u201cTeam leader Kim, didn\u2019t you just come in with authorization documents?\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cYou know that this is an important issue right?\u201dDirector Ma, who had been a director at the company for a long time, shook the document in his hand while looking at Kim Rok Soo.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Director Ma.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not sure? Team leader Kim, do you know how many benefits we will gain if this agreement with the guilds is concluded? You want to take a day off with such a task in front of you? Do you think that that makes any sense?\u201dDirector Ma spoke with annoyance and anger in his voice.Team 2 and Team 3 leaders who came with Team leader Kim scowled at Director Ma\u2019s annoyance, but did not say anything against it.The issue of the agreement with the guilds in that document in Director Ma\u2019s hand was something that would bring a lot of benefits to the company, and it would be disappointing if Team leader Kim Rok Soo, the leader of one of the three teams at the core of that agreement, was not going to be there with the conclusion of the agreement right in front of them.\u201cDo the two of you think it makes any sense?\u201dDirector Ma asked the two other team leaders for their thoughts.However, the two team leaders did not say anything to take Director Ma\u2019s side. They simply kept their mouths shut.Then they exchanged glances with each other.\u2018Director Ma doesn\u2019t seem to know, huh?\u2019\u2018Yeah. I don\u2019t think he knows.\u2019They understood Director Ma\u2019s thoughts but also understood why Kim Rok Soo was doing this.Team 2 leader finished exchanging glances with Team 3 leader and started speaking.\u201cI think that it will be fine even without Team leader Kim, Director-nim. All that is left is to sign the agreement and that is for you to do.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the day we sign it the most important day? Hmm?\u201dTeam 2 leader held back a sigh.Team leader Kim Rok Soo had done everything he needed to do regarding this task.Of course, the day where they sign the agreement was important as Director Ma mentioned. It was the final button to be closed. However, it was fine if Kim Rok Soo was not present when Director Ma and the guild leaders signed the document and shook hands.\u2018It is definitely something that someone like Director Ma, who cares a lot about formality, would throw a fuss about.\u2019That was the reason he didn\u2019t call the Department head or any other high ranking officials and called the three team leaders who were lower level employees.Team 2 leader saw that Director Ma\u2019s arrow of anger headed back toward Kim Rok Soo as he did not say anything.He subconsciously opened his mouth after hearing what Director Ma said next.\u201cTeam leader Kim, I thought that you were a talented person with a strong sense of responsibility. You are making me have some doubts. I wonder if it is okay to leave a team in your care.\u201d\u2018Uhh, uhh, this idiot Director Ma sounds like he\u2019s about to say something that crosses the line.He can\u2019t say something like that today of all days!\u2019Team 2 leader looked at Team 3 leader and both of them opened their mouths at the same time.However, someone spoke before the two of them could say anything.Kim Rok Soo, who had quietly been sitting there without any expression visible on his face, was talking.He was currently the youngest of the team leaders.\u201cI know that the agreement is an important task, but it is not a matter of life and death.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJust as Director Ma frowned and he was about to raise his voice\u2026\u201c\u2026Director-nim!\u201dTeam 3 leader opened his mouth.\u201cTeam leader Kim Rok Soo\u2026 Hasn\u2019t he worked for the past \u2018one year\u2019 even coming in on the weekend without resting? He\u2019s been doing that for the past \u2018one year.\u2019\u201d\u201cWho said that wasn\u2019t the case? But why does he need to take a day off now of all the available days? I know that he\u2019s worked hard for the past yea-\u201dDirector Ma stopped for a moment.One year.It had been one year since Kim Rok Soo had become a team leader.He observed Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face as soon as he realized that. He then resumed speaking.\u201cEven I am well aware that he has worked hard.\u201dHowever, his voice was definitely not as strong as it had been before.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Team 2 leader held back a sigh and started speaking.\u201cDirector-nim. I know that you must be disappointed to not have Team leader Kim at the ceremony, but didn\u2019t he do a very good job with getting everything done? Team 3 leader and I are enough for the ceremony! You know we are reliable, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAhem. I am very well aware of your abilities, Team 2 and Team 3 leaders. The two of you will be enough for the ceremony to proceed smoothly. Ahem.\u201dHe continued to peek at Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face.\u201cI was just saying that it would be great if Team 1, the pride of our company, and the team leader of that team would participate in the ceremony.\u201dTeam 3 leader smiled awkwardly and nodded his head.As they had expected, Director Ma was acting like this because the team leader of Team 1 was not going to participate in the ceremony. He probably would have said a thing or two if he, as the team leader of team 3, had said that he couldn\u2019t show up, but he would not have called all of them here like this. He probably wouldn\u2019t have cared much about it.\u201cWell, for the past year, you\u2019ve worked very hard, so I guess it would be good for you to get a good rest.\u201dDirector Ma said that and looked at team 2 leader who held back another sigh and responded.\u201cYes, sir. I agree with you! Hahaha!\u201d\u201cRight? Ahem, I know you must all be busy as well, so you can go!\u201d\u201cYes, Director-nim!\u201dTeam 2 and Team 3 leaders immediately stood up and Kim Rok Soo followed them. The three of them bowed and left the Director\u2019s office.Director Ma confirmed that the door was closed before immediately checking the calendar.\u201c\u2026Tsk. It\u2019s already that time.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like Kim Rok Soo very much.However, he accepted that Kim Rok Soo was skilled.\u201cYes. Nobody other than Team leader Kim would have been able to do so much in almost a year.\u201dDirector Ma thought about last year.Kim Rok Soo was the only survivor on Team 1.He had carried on Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s desires and became the team leader.Team 1 was in ruins at the time.Everybody thought that its reputation would crumble. Both people inside the company and outside thought that Team 1 without Lee Soo Hyuk and his subordinates would be nothing much.However, those speculations were completely crushed.In just one year, Kim Rok Soo did not make Team 1, but it was at least basically back to normal.That was why people were saying that they truly were Team 1, and based on Team 1\u2019s pace, they were once again saying that they would be the company\u2019s ace team again, unlike last year.\u201c\u2026He didn\u2019t even take a break when Team leader Lee passed away. Tsk.\u201dDirector Ma had not liked Lee Soo Hyuk either.However, he was disappointed at Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s death. To be more honest, it was a feeling of loss.Most people who knew the guy probably felt this way.They also probably had another thought. They all probably thought that it would be difficult to fill the giant hole from that loss.Lee Soo Hyuk was a true leader.Director Ma thought about Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face. He was still young for being a team leader, but his expression had changed to that of a true leader in one year.\u201cThey call you cold-blooded, but I guess you are human too.\u201dDirector Ma let out a short sigh.\u201c\u2026Is he only taking one day off?\u201dHe clicked his tongue at the feeling of bitterness.His gaze did not move from the calendar.Tomorrow.Nothing was marked on that date, but Director Ma could not forget what happened last year on that day.\u201cIt\u2019s been one year.\u201dTomorrow would mark one year since team leader Lee Soo Hyuk and his team members died.The members of Team 1 were the people who were most aware of it.Team 1 had a lot of newbies or individuals with not too much experience compared to the other teams. Of course, there were some team members who had a lot of years of experience outside of the company.Regardless of their years of experience, all members of Team 1 were quietly doing their work and peeking at the door connected to the hallway over and over. This was different from their usual demeanor.At that time\u2026Screeeech-The door opened and Kim Rok Soo walked in. They all quickly looked at their desks.\u201cAssistant Leader Ha.\u201d\u201cYes, team leader-nim!\u201d\u201cWill you please come here for a moment?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe middle-aged man Kim Rok Soo addressed as Assistant Leader Ha responded quite energetically and quickly unlike his usual self and walked over to Kim Rok Soo\u2019s desk.Kim Rok Soo needed people to support him in order to restore Team 1 after the incident last year made him the team leader. Assistant Leader Ha was the person who came when they recruited experienced workers.He was one of the rescue team members who had worked under Lee Soo Hyuk in the past at the Seomyeon, Busan shelter.Assistant Leader Ha was the best person to support team leader Kim Rok Soo as he had interacted with Kim Rok Soo a couple times in the past as well.But maybe because of those past interactions\u2026Assistant Leader Ha usually acted cheeky and relaxed.\u201cDid you need something, team leader-nim?\u201dHowever, he was quite quick right now.Some of the team members shook their heads mumbling about how Assistant Leader Ha\u2019s actions made it even more obvious, but he had no choice but to act like this.Lee Soo Hyuk.He was an extremely important person to Assistant Leader Ha. Although Lee Soo Hyuk was much younger than him, he was the one and only person Assistant Leader Ha had recognized as his \u2018boss.\u2019That was why, although he was staying in the Busan shelter with retirement on his mind, he immediately dropped everything and came here after hearing that Team 1 was struggling because of Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s death.\u2018Boss, are the newbies that good?\u2019\u2018Yes. They\u2019re really good. The two of them will surpass me someday.\u2019\u2018Oh come on. No way. You are one for the history books boss, you are historic!\u2019\u2018Historic my ass. Cut the crap. Anyway, I need to properly raise the two of them.\u2019Assistant Leader Ha suddenly remembered a conversation he had with Lee Soo Hyuk a few years ago.\u201cAssistant Leader-nim. Please just check these things tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, sir.\u201dAssistant Leader Ha took the documents from Kim Rok Soo and observed him.\u2018\u2026Boss. Kim Rok Soo is an amazing person as you mentioned. I am certain that he will become even more amazing than you.\u2019There had been no deaths nor serious injuries on Team 1 since Kim Rok Soo became team leader. Although there were people who received minor injuries, nobody ever had to be hospitalized for longer than a few days because of a serious injury.Instead, the number of scars on Kim Rok Soo\u2019s body continued to increase.\u201cI will not be here tomorrow, so thank you for taking care of everything in my place.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, sir! I will take care of everything properly.\u201d\u201cHowever, if there are any urgent situations or you receive an emergency order to mobilize, you must contact me right away.\u201dAssistant Leader Ha was planning on not contacting Kim Rok Soo and taking care of things on his own if possible, at least for tomorrow. However, Kim Rok Soo emphasized this part as if he realized that.\u201cYou must. You must contact me.\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dAssistant Leader Ha sighed. He then somewhat nodded his head.\u201cYes, sir, I will think about it and contact you.\u201dIt was his usual cheeky response, but Kim Rok Soo knew that Assistant Leader Ha saying something like this meant that it was a promise to contact him during any emergency situations. He sent Assistant Leader Ha back to his seat and looked at the clock.It was time to leave.Kim Rok Soo thought about Director Ma, who called them just as it was getting time to leave work, and slightly frowned.He stood up and peeked at the calendar.He would go see his friends for the first time in a long while tomorrow.\u201cI will see you all in two days. Please call me if you need anything.\u201dKim Rok Soo said goodbye to his team members and walked out of the office. He chose to take the stairs instead of the elevator down to the first floor lobby.He didn\u2019t want to run into anyone while leaving work today.He was certain that they would all act awkwardly around him similar to how his team members, the other team leaders, and Director Ma had acted.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201dHe heard an extremely annoyed voice at that moment.Kim Rok Soo looked toward the bottom of the stairs.\u201cWhy are you coming down this way?\u201dThe grumbling person was team 2\u2019s Park Kyung Ho.He was the electric spear user who had joined the company at the same time as Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo.\u201cThen why are you coming up this way?\u201dKim Rok Soo threw the same question back to Park Kyung Ho who scowled immediately.\u201cI always use the stairs. Do you know how much health benefits you can get by climbing the stairs?\u201d\u201cPffft.\u201dKim Rok Soo subconsciously chuckled at this extremely un-Park Kyung Ho-like response. Park Kyung Ho snorted while looking at Kim Rok Soo.\u201cHmph. It\u2019s obvious why you are coming down the stairs.\u201dHe grumbled as if he really didn\u2019t like something.\u201cYou care so damn much about what other people might say.\u201dPark Kyung Ho basically stomped up the stairs.\u201cHey, Kim Rok Soo.\u201dSpearman Park Kyung Ho did not call Kim Rok Soo by his title but rather spoke even more freely than when they were same level colleagues.Team 2 leader had said something about it, but Park Kyung Ho refused to listen and said the following to Kim Rok Soo.\u2018I will be the second fastest person to become a team leader. You just wait! You got that?\u2019Kim Rok Soo did not get angry at Park Kyung Ho.He knew what the guy was thinking on the inside despite all the grumbling.\u201cI can\u2019t go tomorrow.\u201dKim Rok Soo chuckled at Park Kyung Ho\u2019s grumbling voice and responded.\u201cIs that why you went today?\u201dTeam 2 leader had told him that Park Kyung Ho had taken a half day today. He probably came back to the company at the end of the work day despite taking the half day because he had things to take care of.\u201c\u2026Damn it!\u201dPark Kyung Ho glared at Kim Rok Soo. He then walked past him and climbed higher up.\u201c\u2026Call me if you need a drink tomorrow.\u201dOf course, he left a leaving remark in place of a goodbye.Kim Rok Soo also did the same thing.\u201cWho knows?\u201dPark Kyung Ho stomped even more in annoyance as he climbed the stairs but Kim Rok Soo did not care as he walked down.It was time to go home.It would also soon be time to go meet his friends.* * *There was something people started saying once monsters appeared and the world started to change.\u2018We\u2019ll be lucky if we can at least find the corpses.\u2019Kim Rok Soo had this thought right now.Was it really lucky?Yes, it might be considered that way.If nothing was left, then the people left behind could only long for them with their memories.However, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s memories were too clear.That was why he could not even think about coming here.Memorial Park.The ashes or some possessions belonging to those who left this world while working for the company were placed or stored in this park.Of course, it was not a requirement; the families could choose not to keep them here.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dKim Rok Soo, who entered one of the many ossuaries in the park, looked toward the direction with quite a lot of flowers and gave a short greeting.< Lee Soo Hyuk >< Choi Jung Soo >The names of his lost friends caught Kim Rok Soo\u2019s gaze and wouldn\u2019t let him go.Kim Rok Soo stared for a long time before finally managing to close his eyes.\u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dClosing his eyes made the memories pop up.That was why he could not get complacent, stop, nor rest. There was something he had to do.\u201cAnyway, Team 1 is rolling along well.\u201dThis phrase was representative of everything Kim Rok Soo had to do to prepare to come to this place.That was why that was all he could say.Kim Rok Soo stood there for a long time.In the silent area\u2026He could not hear any sounds. It was so quiet that he couldn\u2019t even breathe in peace.However, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s mind was full of numerous memories more than any other time.The weight of the memories reaching out at him through the silence was too heavy to handle.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dKim Rok Soo let out a short sigh before standing up straight.\u201cI will go now.\u201dThat was his goodbye to his team members before he turned around. He then had a thought that made him turn back to look at Choi Jung Soo\u2019s spot.\u201cI\u2019ll be able to go where your family is located soon.\u201dThe village where most of Choi Jung Soo\u2019s family lost their lives\u2026 A small hill from where he could see that place\u2026Kim Rok Soo thought about a memory from the past before leaving after making that single comment.He walked out and looked up at the sky.The sun was high up in the sky.It was noon.There was still so much time left until this day was over.Kim Rok Soo ended up walking back home.Click.He turned the light on.It was quiet here too.Kim Rok Soo silently sighed before lying down on the floor.He needed to change and clean the house, but it was too annoying.All he did was slowly breathe in and out.He focused on his breathing.That made his chaotic mind slowly calm down.Peeep\u2014Kim Rok Soo sat up after hearing a noise.< Emergency Mobilization >He immediately stood up after seeing the message from Assistant Leader Ha.\u201cThis is actually better.\u201dAlthough his day off would be over if he went to the company and out into the field\u2026Kim Rok Soo thought that this was better for him.He opened the door and walked out of the area that was only filled with silence.* * *\u201cHuman! Human!\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u2026?\u201dCale realized that he had fallen asleep and slowly opened his eyes.\u201cHuman! Open your eyes!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s opening them now, nya!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! He is opening them now, nya! We were ready to break the bed if you didn\u2019t wake up!\u201d\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea, nya.\u201dRaon, On, and Hong\u2019s conversation slammed against Cale\u2019s ears nonstop.Their voices were so distinct and their conversation so hopping that it would be considered loud if he chose to think of it that way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Human, where is it chaotic? I want to go see it!\u201d\u201cMe too, nya! I\u2019m curious, nya!\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think we need to go anywhere to see that, nya.\u201dRaon, Hong, and On commented one after another at Cale\u2019s comment. Cale shook his head.Someone offered him a warm cup of tea as he did that.\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201dIt was Ron.Cale subconsciously sat up as soon as he saw Ron smiling in the most benign way he had seen in months.Ron handed him some honey lemon tea as if it was normal and Cale chose to drink it for now.\u2018Why is he smiling like that all of a sudden?\u2019This was when Cale still got scared every so often whenever he saw Ron smiling benignly like this.Ron didn\u2019t care as he observed Cale with a cold sunken gaze that was different from his benign smile.\u2018He\u2019s weirder than usual today.\u2019Cale\u2019s complexion was worse than usual despite just waking up.He looked like a puppy that was completely drenched from the rain. Of course, crown prince Alberu would just say that he looked like he was sleeping and just woke up, but it was different to Ron.\u201cHmm.\u201dHe subconsciously thoroughly inspected Cale\u2019s face as Cale avoided his gaze.\u2018What\u2019s up with him?\u2019Cale suddenly got the chills.\u201cWe are considering having a feast for dinner as it is the last day of the year. What do you think, young master-nim?\u201dCale could see the eyes of the children averaging seven years old sparkling. Cale slowly turned his gaze away from the sparkling eyes that were full of anticipation and looked at Ron.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dSmile.Ron had an exaggerated smile on his face. Cale had an ominous feeling for some reason.\u201cI will do whatever I want as you indicated, young master-nim.\u201d\u2018Why did this sound so much as if he was going to go assassinate someone?\u2019Cale touched the back of his neck despite knowing that it wouldn\u2019t happen.Knock knock.There were some knocks on the door at that moment and they heard Choi Han\u2019s voice.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dRon headed toward the door.\u201cThen I will go down and finish preparing for the feast, young master-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sure, whatever.\u201dRon opened the door once Cale nonchalantly commented.Click.Choi Han\u2019s eyebrow raised slightly while looking at Ron come out.\u2018He doesn\u2019t seem too happy.\u2019Ron\u2019s expression was not good. Choi Han quickly looked at Cale.Ron didn\u2019t care and walked past Choi Han and down the stairs.\u201cI\u2019m going too! A feast! I\u2019m very happy!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to help, nya!\u201dRaon and Hong followed behind Ron.Only Choi Han, On, and Cale were left.\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, Cale-nim.\u201dChoi Han immediately closed the open door at Cale\u2019s comment. But he thought of something that made his face stiffen.\u2018Even the hallway is heated by magic right now. He\u2019s cold? Is Cale-nim\u2019s condition very bad? Why is he suddenly like this? His complexion was slowly getting better.\u2019Choi Han had all sorts of questions. He then heard Cale lie back down on the bed while mumbling.\u201cI want to keep living as a slacker.\u201dThose words sounded a bit differently to Choi Han today. Of course, the words themselves were things that Cale always said.Cale naturally had no care about what Choi Han was thinking.\u2018Should I close that window?\u2019The sun would be setting soon.The temperature was falling quickly because the sun went down much faster in the winter. The fact that they were right next to a forest probably played a part as well.However, Cale could not close the open window at the other end of the room.\u201cLet\u2019s work hard a little longer!\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe Wolf children seemed to still be training outside.Nowhere around here seemed to be quiet.Chh chh.Cale didn\u2019t even turn his head despite the rustling next to him and continued to look out the window.\u201cThat\u2019s ticklish.\u201dHe simply gave a comment to the kitten who was leaning against his side.Cale found it a bit odd that it was On and not Raon or Hong who was doing this, but he didn\u2019t put much attention on it.Everything was annoying, potentially because of the time spent either sleeping or wandering through his memories.He closed his eyes.\u2018It\u2019s never quiet. Will the new year be different? Will it?\u2019Cale had those thoughts as he turned 19 in this world. (TL: Guess this world still uses the Korean system of turning older with the new year.)* * *The now 19 years old Cale stayed in Harris Village until early spring before starting another busy year by going to the Ten Finger Mountains and saving the Elf Village.He faced all sorts of incidents and returned to the territory after finishing his business in the Empire with a Medal of Honor from the Emperor for his heroics in the Imperial Palace Bomb Terror Incident.\u201cWill you rest now, Cale-nim?\u201dCale nodded his head at Choi Han\u2019s question.\u201cYes. Time to rest.\u201dHe looked toward the Henituse territory that was slowly getting closer outside the carriage window and mumbled almost in a sigh.\u201cSlacker life is best.\u201dChoi Han held back a sigh while looking at Cale who had become paler and skinnier since last year.Cale had come here to rest to keep his promise of spending the new year in the territory.It would be a short break. There were more things he needed to do.\u2018Cale-nim, are we pushing back the thing with young master Antonio until February?\u2019\u2018We will. We ended up staying too long in the Empire.\u2019Cale spoke as if he had no choice.\u2018I have no choice. It\u2019s the new year soon. Wouldn\u2019t it be good to spend the new year at home with family?\u2019Family. Choi Han repeated that word in his mind as he gently smiled while looking at the individuals inside the carriage.Choi Han saw Cale frown at that moment.As they passed through the territory gate\u2026\u201cYoung master-nim! I was in complete awe after hearing about your Medal of Honor from the Empire! You are the treasure of the Roan Kingdom and the future of the Henituse territory, young master-nim!\u201dA knight who seemed pretty new at the job looked inside the carriage before glancing at Cale with a sparkling gaze that was full of awe.Cale gently closed his eyes again and then opened them.\u201c\u2026Can we pass?\u201d\u201cYes, young master-nim! I\u2019m sure that there is nothing dangerous in your carriage, but I ask for your understanding as this is the formal procedure.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make any exceptions. It is the right thing to do.\u201d\u201cI knew it\u2026! You truly are amazing, young master-nim!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dChoi Han could see Cale\u2019s face turning stoic by the second.Shh.Choi Han peeked at the announcements on a board by the territory gate.Of the many announcements, he could see a kingdom-wide announcement talking about Cale\u2019s Medal of Honor from the Empire and the crown prince\u2019s visit to the Empire. An announcement from the Henituse territory had the story of Cale\u2019s Medal of Honor from the Empire in a much larger font than the crown prince\u2019s visit.Choi Han hoped that Cale did not see them as he slowly turned away.The knight inspecting the carriage bowed to Cale.\u201cYou may proceed, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cOkay, keep up the good work.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe knight responded energetically, hesitated for a moment, and then smiled brightly as he said the following.\u201cWelcome home, young master-nim. I hope you have a peaceful stay.\u201dChoi Han could see a small smile appearing on Cale\u2019s face.\u201cI hope you have a lovely end of the year as well.\u201d\u201cYes, sir! It is an honor to hear something like that from you, young master-nim! I will remember those words for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dCale\u2019s face turned stoic again, but he didn\u2019t seem annoyed.The carriage slowly moved through the gate and Choi Han reached over to close the open carriage window.It was at that moment.\u201cWow! Mommy, that\u2019s Young Master Silver Shield, right? Daddy said that the young master-nim was coming!\u201dHe heard a child\u2019s voice.\u201cYes, yes. It is that carriage. The young master of our territory who received a Medal of Honor from the Empire is in there. The sword master-nim is probably in there too.\u201d\u201cI, I want to see the young master-nim\u2019s face!\u201dIt started with a mother and daughter\u2019s conversation, and then\u2026\u201cThe young master-nim is here?\u201d\u201cAhem. You heard it as well. They said that the young master-nim would be in the territory soon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dAn old couple who came out for a walk to get some sun despite the cold winter weather peeked at the carriage.\u201cOur Young Master Silver Shield-nim just arrived at the territory?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThey heard some voices and the residents of the territory, who had not been very visible because of the winter weather, slowly started to become visible.Choi Han subconsciously watched the people as the bright looks of joy on their faces took him by shock.He heard an extremely stoic voice at that moment.\u201cChoi Han, close it.\u201dCale was wiping his face with both hands.Choi Han chuckled before closing the window. He then made a comment.\u201cAll of them want to see your face, Cale-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201d\u201cMeeeeeow!\u201d\u201cMeeow!\u201d\u201cHuman! Let\u2019s show them your face! I\u2019m fine remaining invisible!\u201dCale groaned while the children averaging eight years old seemed excited. Cale waved his hand to say no.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry home.\u201dHome. The carriage headed toward the Henituse Estate as he said that word.\u201cHuman, we\u2019re here!\u201dOn and Hong, who had been falling asleep, looked out the window at Raon\u2019s shout.\u201cHuman, it\u2019s your younger brother!\u201dBasen was looking at the carriage and waving his hand while standing outside the Henituse Estate.\u201cLong time no see, Basen.\u201d\u201cYes, hyung-nim. It has been a while.\u201dBasen responded to Cale in a gruff but slightly high tone.\u201cOrabuni!\u201dCale turned his head.Lily had a wooden sword in her hand as she walked over from the training ground. Cale waved at her before speaking to Basen.\u201cI got you a present, so come get it later.\u201d\u201cDid you buy it at the Empire?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dCale responded with indifference before heading into the building. Basen slightly smiled while looking at Cale. He then followed behind Cale. Basen\u2019s shoulders were slightly raised for some reason.\u201cI heard that you were very busy in the Empire, hyung-nim. But you still managed to buy us presents.\u201d\u201cWhat does being busy have to do with buying presents?\u201d\u2018A lot.\u2019That was what Basen wanted to say, but he kept his mouth shut.A small smile appeared on Choi Han\u2019s face as he realized that although Cale and Basen had their usual stoic faces, both of them seemed oddly happy.\u2018Yes, this kind of peace is what Cale-nim and everybody wants.\u2019That was why he needed to get stronger to protect everyone.Choi Han\u2019s eyes clouded over as he stood there with an innocent smile on his face.\u2018What\u2019s up with him?\u2019Cale had turned his head without giving it much thought before seeing Choi Han\u2019s face and flinching.It was because Choi Han suddenly started smiling innocently as his eyes were burning up with passion.The innocent smile was fine, but that gaze made Cale get the chills for some reason.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cAt least you should be able to rest properly during the end of this year and the approaching new year.\u201d\u201cProbably\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u2018Why is he saying something like that with such a look on his face?\u2019Cale looked stupefied. Choi Han didn\u2019t care and clenched his fists.\u2018I hope the end of this year and the approaching new year will be peaceful.\u2019Choi Han truly hoped that would be the case.As for Cale, he saw Choi Han\u2019s clenched fists and contemplated whether he recently did anything wrong to Choi Han despite knowing there was nothing like that.He was feeling guilty although there was no reason to feel guilty.\u201cMeeeeeow.\u201d\u201cMeeow.\u201dHowever, Cale looked away from Choi Han after hearing On and Hong\u2019s meows and started walking.Choi Han walked slowly behind them.The group walked peacefully into the building without any signs of awkwardness.\u2013 Choi Han, I\u2019m going to the room first!The invisible Raon\u2019s energetic voice was full of warmth.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dChoi Han let out a quiet sigh.Now\u2026He now had many places he could return to peacefully without feeling awkward.And those places were truly important to Choi Han.Similar to last year, Choi Han spent the end of the year and welcomed the new year without any loneliness or coldness.* * *So many things happened in the new year.Whether it was the White Star or the sealed god, all sorts of suffocating things that made it impossible for them to stop kept happening one after another.\u2018But winter still came.\u2019Time continued to flow and it was now winter.Choi Han heard a familiar voice in his ear.The eldest son of the House of Henituse who was known as trash\u2026 It started there, but that guy was now his liege, the friend of his nephew, the core of his new family, and possibly the person who understood him the most. It was the voice of someone who had many different titles to Choi Han.Cale was mumbling.\u201cHaaaa. It\u2019d be great to be a slacker.\u201dChoi Han knew the meaning of those words.\u2018I want to rest. I need to heal.\u2019That should be the meaning.However, he now knew what Cale would say after that.\u201cDid Billos wake up yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet, Cale-nim. Jack-nim has finished healing him and is watching his progress.\u201dBillos had come to find Cale.The bastard of the Flynn Merchant Guild came looking for Cale while severely injured and looking like a mess, asking Cale to stop the Flynn Merchant Guild.\u2018\u2026Hunters.\u2019Choi Han\u2019s eyes were about to sink low when he saw the look in Cale\u2019s eyes and slightly flinched.\u201cReally?\u201dCale\u2019s eyes showed no signs of resting just yet. Cale\u2019s gaze was cold but burning up. There was also a twisted smile on his face that didn\u2019t look gentle at all.Choi Han thought that he knew what Cale would say next.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to Billos when he wakes up, but for now-\u201d\u201cYes, Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cChoi Han, I think you should know this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Know what, Cale-nim?\u201d\u201cThe team leader is in Endable.\u201dChoi Han subconsciously said the name that came to his mind.\u201cLee Soo Hyuk?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dCale looked toward the east and calmly commented.\u201cThere are too many things to do, so I can\u2019t rest.\u201d\u2013 Side story 7, \u2018The Day of Rest for the One who Dreams of Being a Slacker\u2019 End. \u2013\u2013 I will return with Part 2, \u2018The Laws of the Hunt\u2019 starting July 1st. \u2013< Author\u2019s Note >Hello, it is Yu Ryeo Han.The side stories that have been released for about half a year have come to a close with side story 7.There were a lot of other individuals and things I wanted to talk about, but I will push those back for another time.Part 2, The Laws of the Hunt will start July 1st.Why is my heart beating so wildly?!I think that I am shaking even more now that I am writing about shaking.The start of something coming up must be making me shake like this.I want to quickly say hello with Part 2!Ah!

However, his eyes kept closing.\u201cMm.\u201dRaon raised his head. The single magic light seemed like it had turned into two.\u201c\u2026Eek!\u201dRaon became shocked and rubbed his mouth.He was drooling.Swish, swish!Raon looked around in shock. He knew that nobody else was in this basement laboratory, but it would have been embarrassing if someone had seen him drooling and dozing off.\u201cAhem. Hem!\u201dRaon let out some fake coughs and slightly shook his head.\u2018I just need to do a little more!\u2019Raon recalled how Cale had told him he needed to eat and sleep well in a rare serious tone, but he chose to push that thought aside for now.Swoooooooosh-Raon caused a small breeze with his mana. White snowflakes started appearing inside the breeze one after another. A smile appeared on Raon\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026Pretty\u2026\u2026\u201dThis snowy breeze felt much softer and fluffier than earlier. Raon subconsciously gasped in awe.Blink blink.However, his eyelids were not listening to him.Raon had gone to sleep at his bedtime pretty much every night since Cale started his slacker life vacation at this residence other than when he was out looking at the stars.Maybe that was the reason, but even this great and mighty Dragon could not keep his eyelids from closing down.\u201cN, no\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon shouted, \u2018No,\u2019 but his round head kept nodding off and lowering.Swoooooooosh-The snow breeze slowly disappeared as well.Raon, who was seated on Rosalyn\u2019s chair, scrunched his eyes.Flash flash.The magic light was oddly flashing.Was it about to turn off? That blinking light felt oddly distant to Raon.\u201cI\u2026need to, do it-\u201dRaon closed his eyes as he mumbled.\u2018Only for a little bit. I\u2019m only going to close my eyes for a little bit!\u2019He then sunk into the cozy darkness.It was only for an instant.Raon was certain that it had not been long since he closed his eyes.\u201cEek!\u201dHowever, he couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes in shock.Honestly speaking, his eyes didn\u2019t open very easily. His eyelids didn\u2019t move very well and felt as if they were swollen. His vision was blurry.\u201cEek!\u201dHowever, Raon realized that something was weird.He felt his body slightly shaking as it swayed gently as if he was on a ship. No, it felt like he was being held-\u2018Held?\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes finally opened and he raised his head.\u201cEek!\u201dHe was shocked once again.\u201cH, human!\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t make me talk.\u201dRaon realized that the shaking was from Cale\u2019s arms shaking while the swaying was from Cale climbing the stairs.Raon couldn\u2019t hide his shock after waking up not in the laboratory but on the stairs.This was the staircase heading from the basement to above ground.\u201cHuman! I said not to b, bother me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuman, I was not sleeping! I was only closing my eyes for a moment, but you lifted me up and started moving me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuman, I know that you can\u2019t talk because this is difficult for you, so let me down!\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dCale let out a deep sigh.\u201c\u2026I told you not to make me talk\u2026\u2026\u201dHe mumbled with a stoic gaze before looking down at Raon.Raon\u2019s round eyes were focused on him.\u201cHuman! I\u2019m going back to the laboratory!\u201d\u201cPffft.\u201dCale chuckled and stepped off the last step. He then turned his body.\u201cLook outside.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dRaon turned his head from Cale and toward where Cale was pointing.He heard voices from the second floor at that moment.\u201cI need to sleep, nya, huh?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dHong was grumbling before gasping in shock while On let out a low gasp.Once Raon saw where Cale was pointing toward\u2026\u201cGo outside.\u201dHe heard Cale\u2019s nonchalant voice and Raon subconsciously left Cale\u2019s arms.\u201c\u2026Snow-\u201dIn the dark night\u2026.Something white was falling from the sky.The door was wide open.Raon subconsciously headed out the door while watching the view outside.\u201cSnow-\u201dHong saw the snow as well. Hong subconsciously dug into Ron\u2019s arms.He saw Mary at that moment.Mary was standing outside the door in her black robe while waving at him.Hong also saw Raon looking at him.Raon was a Dragon but was younger than him. Raon\u2019s eyes were sparkling so brightly. His round face was full of joy.Raon had a bright smile on his face as he spoke to Hong.\u201cIt\u2019s snowing! It\u2019s the first snow!\u201dRaon then stopped right before the door, turned around, and flew over to Hong and On. Hong lowered his head. On was in her human form looking at Hong.Hong looked at his sister\u2019s gaze, then at the approaching Raon, then at the waving Mary, and then\u2026Jump.Hong jumped out of Ron\u2019s arms. He then headed toward the door step by step.Raon flew out the door only after seeing Hong move.\u201cIt\u2019s snowing! It\u2019s the first snow!\u201d\u201cSnow!\u201dExtremely large clear white snowflakes were falling from the sky.Stars were not visible in the sky, making Raon feel as if these snowflakes were stars.They were not sparkling like stars, and they disappeared quickly once they melted in his paws, but\u2026\u201c\u2026So pretty.\u201dThey were still pretty.Raon turned his head and looked around. The lights were on in the building and Choi Han, the Deputy Butler, the Wolf children, and even the Vice Captain were out near the door smiling at Raon.\u201cRaon.\u201dCale was standing near the door as he spoke to Raon.\u201cCast some light around. Then everybody will be able to see it better.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dRaon created some orbs of light instead of the spell he had been practicing all day. He then spread them out throughout the darkness.\u201cWooooooooooow\u2014\u201dIt was beautiful.The large snowflakes falling through the silent night were cold but oddly felt warm.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right!\u201dRaon quickly used another spell.\u201cHmm?\u201dCale looked at Raon after feeling warmth surrounding him. It was the same for the others.Raon chuckled and shouted brightly.\u201cYou cannot catch a cold! Everybody has to be warm!\u201dCale laughed and commented back.\u201cI\u2019ll get to be warm while experiencing the first snow thanks to you.\u201dRaon\u2019s smile became even bigger.Mary was looking at Hong with an awkward expression at that moment.\u201cMm, I prepared this because I thought you might get cold, but I think that it will be okay.\u201dMary had a small cape in her hands. The red cape was obviously Hong\u2019s size.Hong silently looked up at Mary, who turned away to look at the now visible snow coming down as she spoke.\u201cSnow is something like this as well.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHong quietly gasped.He then nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right, nya! Snow is something like this as well, nya!\u201dToday, Hong saw snow different from the snow he had seen until now. The red kitten looked around. Mary, who prepared a cape for him, Ron, who had carried him despite his grumbling, Beacrox, who was busy inside preparing some cookies and warm tea\u2026 All of his family members who were now awake and standing outside their home\u2026\u201cShould we go?\u201dOn looked at Hong and Raon and asked.\u201cSounds great!\u201dRaon quickly flew down and stood next to On.Hong slowly moved next to On as well.The snow had piled a bit.However, there were no footsteps outside the house.Everybody was just standing by the door.The children knew why they were doing this.The three moved in unison as they stepped onto the yard.Squish.The three of their footsteps appeared on the snow for the first time.Raon subconsciously shouted with excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s soft!\u201dThe snow was soft.\u2018It was really soft!\u2019The snow was cold, but he was not cold at all because of the temperature management spell.\u201cHuman!\u201dRaon moved over to Cale and asked.\u201cHuman, did you not sleep because you were waiting for the first snow?\u201dHe had peeked at the clock to see that it was 11 pm.It was amazing that the human, who lately started nodding off as soon as the sun went down, was still awake.Cale brusquely responded.\u201cWas I the only one who didn\u2019t sleep?\u201dRaon, On, and Hong looked around.Everybody was awake.They had been waiting for the first snow. The Wolf children looked as if they had been sleeping, but they mischievously smiled at Raon, On, and Hong as well.The three children could feel in their hearts as to why everybody had not been sleeping. Hong and Raon still didn\u2019t know how to properly explain that feeling, but they knew everything they needed to know.Hong raised his head.A snowflake fell on his face.\u2018The snow might not be the issue for you either, Hong.\u2019He recalled what Mary had told him. Hong walked over to Mary.\u201cI want to see it together, nya.\u201dHe still didn\u2019t have the confidence to jump around the snow with joy.However, he wanted to walk on the snow with Mary.\u201cOf course.\u201dMary walked over to the children.Raon shouted at that moment.\u201cLet\u2019s all make some snowmen together!\u201dHe had a look of urgency on his face that looked as if it would overflow with excitement and anticipation.\u201cWe need to make a snowman family!\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaaa.\u201dCale sighed and grumbled as he walked over to Raon. The Wolf children jumped into the snow with excitement.Lock and the Vice Captain seemed stiff for a bit before they seemed to also get excited and joined in.Choi Han and the Deputy Butler were smiling brightly as they joined the group.On smiled while watching all of them.She observed the adults nearby.Choi Han was a strong and sometimes cold-hearted swordsman.Ron was an assassin and a scary person.She didn\u2019t know too much about Beacrox, but he was a scary and cold person.Cale was a stoic person.However, they were all extremely warm people to On.And to her younger siblings.On looked at the excited Raon and her brother Hong, who slowly walked over to him and started to smile, and started to walk over to them as well.On was smiling, and it didn\u2019t look as if the corners of her lips would ever come down.\u201cMake sure to put some gloves on first.\u201dOn\u2019s smile became even bigger after seeing the three pairs of gloves Ron nonchalantly handed her.* * *The next day.\u201cI\u2019m not this small! I\u2019m bigger than this! The human\u2019s arms shake when he carries me! That means I am big!\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason, nya\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon strongly objected while looking at the snow Dragon that resembled him while Hong looked at Raon, then at Cale\u2019s arms and shook his head with an iffy look on his face.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201dCale seemed baffled at Hong who was sighing while looking at him, but he was too far to know what Hong and Raon were talking about.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, nya.\u201dOn had a pretty good idea what Hong and Raon were talking about, but she feigned ignorance. Instead, she placed a dry fruit Ron handed her into her mouth.The windows of the terrace next to the door that had been closed because it was winter were half open today.\u201cThey were made so well, weren\u2019t they, young master-nim?\u201dCale flinched after hearing a voice right next to him. He turned his head to see Ron looking at him with his fake benign smile.Cale subconsciously responded out of reflex after seeing Ron\u2019s gaze.\u201cWell, sort of, I guess.\u201dCale then turned toward what Ron was talking about.There were as many snowmen as there were people living in this house in the villa\u2019s yard.Cale looked at the snow people standing around snow Cale at the center for a while before turning his head away with a stoic gaze. However, On was certain she saw the corners of Cale\u2019s lips curl slightly up.\u201cHuman!\u201dRaon waved his front paw toward Cale and called out to him.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWill all of this snow melt when it gets warmer?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRaon\u2019s fluttering wings drooped low after Cale responded without any hesitation.\u2018Should I put a preservation spell on it?\u2019The snowmen they made last night seemed even whiter and brighter than Harris Village, which was completely covered in snow. Thinking about them melting made him feel some discomfort. No, it made him disappointed.At that moment\u2026 Hong and Raon made eye contact. Raon realized that Hong had the same thought as him and slightly motioned with his eyes. Hong slightly nodded his head in response.Raon nodded his head as well and mana slowly started gathering around Raon.It was at that moment. They heard a stiff and nonchalant voice.\u201cBut spring will come once it gets warm.\u201dRaon and Hong turned their heads.Cale had a teacup in his hand while looking at some cookies.Raon asked Cale a question.\u201cHuman, will the flowers bloom in spring?\u201dCale reached his hand out and grabbed a cookie as he mumbled.Although different flowers bloomed at different times\u2026\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll bloom in spring.\u201dThere were bound to be flowers that bloomed in spring.\u201cMm.\u201dRaon and Hong looked at each other. The two of them exchanged glances for a while before deciding not to do the preservation spell and headed toward the terrace.\u201cI\u2019m going to eat this too!\u201dRaon\u2019s chubby front paw moved efficiently toward the cookie basket in front of Cale as if it was a hawk\u2019s talon while Hong slowly reached his hand toward his sister On\u2019s tin of dried fruit.Cale and On pushed their respective basket and tin toward Raon and Hong while Ron filled two cups with drinks for them.\u201cWow! It\u2019s raining again, nya!\u201dRaon turned his gaze after Hong shouted.Crunch crunch.Raon watched the snow fall as he ate some cookies.< The little bear\u2019s friend, Tiggy, had told him that the large snowflakes that fall from the sky are cold when they touch your skin but that looking at them makes you feel soft and fluffy. >Raon thought about it.The snow was cold when it touched his skin as the book mentioned, however\u2026 Looking at it like this really made him feel soft and fluffy.\u201cHuman! I\u2019m fluffy now!\u201d\u201cSure, whatever.\u201dRaon ate a cookie Cale handed him and held back a laugh.For some odd reason, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.* * *Once some time passed since then\u2026\u201cWow.\u201dRaon gasped in admiration.\u201cFlowers are growing where the snowmen melted!\u201dThe snow had melted, but simple yet pretty wildflowers filled their spots to announce the arrival of spring.\u201cThey\u2019re pretty, nya!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. They are pretty, nya.\u201dHong and On watched the flowers by Raon\u2019s side.The tiny wildflowers shook and danced with the warm spring breeze.\u2013 Side Story 4. It\u2019s snowing? That\u2019s right! The flowers are also blooming! End \u2013\u2013 There will be a special side story, \u2018I want to know why a birthday is a special day, nya!\u2019 on April 9th.

I want to know why a birthday is a special day, nya!Posted on\u00a0July 8, 2022\u00a0by\u00a0admin\u00a0\u2014\u00a09 Comments \u2193The baby kitten with red fur kicked the floor.Tatap!\u201cHuff, huff.\u201dThe breath was lacking in his chest despite taking deep breaths. His whole body was hurting as if he was being pricked by needles.That was why he stopped walking. It was too hard.\u201cThose damn street cats!\u201dThe red kitten curled his body up at that moment. He felt warmth embrace his body.He then heard a scary noise.Pow!The kitten opened his clenched eyes.A big rock slammed into the ground not too far from him.His legs were shaking.He was scared.\u201cHong.\u201dHowever, the red kitten put some strength into all four of his legs.The warmth he could feel behind his back\u2026That was his sister, On.Hong quickly kicked off the ground and ran forward after hearing his sister\u2019s calm but shaky voice. On followed behind him as if she was protecting him.\u201cThat, that!\u201dThey heard an angry voice behind them.\u201cMeeow!\u201dOn ran past Hong and charged into the dark alley first. Hong followed behind her after hearing her meow.\u201cThese damn petty thieves!\u201dPow!Hong heard a rock hitting the ground behind them again but he did not turn around. No, he couldn\u2019t do that.He could only do whatever he could to continue breathing and push forward.No.He could only run away.\u201cHuff. Huff.\u201dHe ran and ran until they finally made it to a quiet place.It was an alley with regular looking houses.Hong stopped in front of a small house with the lowest fence and tried to catch his breath.\u201cMeeow.\u201dOn came over and looked to see where Hong was injured.She did not let her guard down even as she did that.Hong quietly whispered so that nobody else could hear.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, noona.\u201dEven On and Hong, who were used to all sorts of situations, found it difficult to find food whenever they came into a city and hunting became tough.\u201cJ, just\u2026\u201dHong recalled what just happened in front of the bakery.\u201cI subconsciously touched it because the bread looked so warm.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t planning on eating it. He was roaming around the shop to see if there was any food that someone threw away but the bread on the stand looked so delicious that he subconsciously walked over and touched it.That was the reason he had to be chased by that bakery shop owner.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHong had to curl his body even after hearing On\u2019s calm response.\u2018I\u2019m hungry.\u2019He was hungry.However, he could not complain. His sister roamed around even more than he did every day. She should be even hungrier than he was.\u201cWhat the?\u201dThey heard an unfamiliar voice at that moment and Hong curled his body even more.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe man looked at On and Hong for a bit before looking away and walking through the door of the gate within the fence.\u2018I guess that\u2019s the person who lives here.\u2019Hong slowly hid in the shade underneath the fence.The sun was setting.They might have to sleep underneath this fence tonight. That was why he didn\u2019t want to do anything to anger the person who seemed to live in this house.Slam!The door to the small house opened at that moment.\u201cDaddy!\u201dThe door opened and a young child ran out.\u201cSophia! Were you waiting for daddy?\u201dThe man smiled brightly and opened his arms toward the approaching child.The child jumped into the man\u2019s arms. She then asked with a smile on her face.\u201cDaddy, my present!\u201d\u201cAw. You care more about your present than your daddy.\u201dThe man was smiling despite sounding disappointed. A woman appeared at the door. She shook her head at the child before talking to the man.\u201cShe\u2019s been singing about presents left and right. She was just waiting for you to get home, honey.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe man handed the present in his hand to the child.Both parents talked to the child.\u201cSophia, happy birthday.\u201d\u201cHappy birthday, Sophia. I said happy birthday in the morning, but you like me saying it once more after giving you a present, right?\u201d\u201cYes I do!\u201dThe parents and the child walked into the house. Hong quietly watched them before turning his head.\u201cNoona, what is a birthday?\u201d\u201c\u2026The day you were born.\u201d\u2018Then is the day you were born a day you get celebrated?\u2019Hong wanted to ask that question. However, Hong asked a different question after looking at On\u2019s eyes.\u201cNoona, when is my birthday? And when is your birthday?\u201dOn looked at her younger brother.\u2018Birthday-\u2019It was faint.There was a time when her birthday was celebrated like this girl named Sophia. However, it was when she was so little that she didn\u2019t know the exact date.It was some point after the rainy season when the weather officially started getting hot. All she remembered was that it was during the summer.She also faintly remembered that her brother was born in early fall.\u2018We were young.\u2019They were still young but Hong and On were too young to accurately remember something like their birthday when they ended up alone. To be more specific, it was too much.It was just\u2026\u2018Today is On\u2019s birthday.\u2019That phrase just roamed in her memories like an illusion.There was nobody to tell On and Hong about their birthdays or to celebrate it by the time they learned some numbers and could count the days.They were simply neglected and ignored while being called mutants and dirty.\u2018How persistent.\u2019They were simply looked down at such young things persisting through it all.On knew the emotions behind Hong\u2019s pure eyes but looked away and stoically responded.\u201cI don\u2019t know about our birthdays. I don\u2019t remember anything about them at all.\u201dOn and Hong did not say anything about birthdays to each other after that.* * *However, birthday became a topic for the siblings again because of a new individual.\u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201dThe child who was younger than them that the siblings rescued from the dark cave with Cale and Choi Han\u2026 The black Dragon\u2026It was at a time when the Dragon and the Cat siblings were aware of each other but not close.\u201cWhat is a king?\u201dHong\u2019s eyes opened wide and he looked at On after hearing that question.\u201cMm.\u201dOn groaned while the black Dragon observed the night view of the capital that was visible through the terrace window in Cale\u2019s room as he spoke.\u201cDragons are great and mighty.\u201dHe then tilted his head to one side.\u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201dThe black Dragon said the same thing once more before continuing to speak.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they are doing so much because it is the King\u2019s birthday.\u201dThe night view of the Roan Kingdom\u2019s capital was slowly getting more beautiful as they prepared for the celebration of the King\u2019s 50th birthday.\u201cIs the day you are born important?\u201dHong peeked at On before slowly walking over to the black Dragon\u2019s side. The black Dragon slightly flinched but Hong ignored it and slowly sat down next to him.He then peeked toward a dark spot in the room away from the terrace window and opened his mouth.\u201cI want to know why a birthday is a special day, nya!\u201dHong could see the pair of dark brown eyes that were visible because of the magic light that was on.Cale, who was pretty much lying on the bed looking at the map of the capital, observed the black Dragon and the Cat siblings with a stoic gaze.\u2018Birthday\u2026\u2019Kim Rok Soo did not find his birthday to be very important. He didn\u2019t know whether he felt differently about it when he was young, but it was just another day with a different name as he got older.However, there had been a time when it was important.\u2018That-\u2019Cale was thinking about the past for a bit when he heard a cold voice.\u201cI don\u2019t have a birthday.\u201dThe black Dragon was looking at the lights rising from the darkness on the ground that were different from the stars in the night sky.\u201cI don\u2019t know the day I was born.\u201dIt was obvious for the black Dragon.There was no way to know anything in that dark cave. The flow of time, the changes in the world\u2026The only way for him to get information was from the things the humans said whenever they showed up.\u2018Fuck, he grew this big after two years? Should we give him less food? Shit, the cost to make the restraining device is going to be so high!\u2019\u2018This motherfucking bastard! Isn\u2019t four years enough for you to stop glaring so much?!\u2019He wouldn\u2019t even have known how old he was if the bastards guarding the cell didn\u2019t shout at him with disgust.I don\u2019t know my birthday.\u201cAs a result, I don\u2019t have a birthday.\u201dHong quietly observed the black Dragon\u2019s dark blue eyes.He then subconsciously spoke almost in a shout.\u201cI don\u2019t have one either, nya!\u201dThe black Dragon turned toward Hong. Hong placed his small front paw on the black Dragon\u2019s smooth body and continued speaking.\u201cIt\u2019s okay even if you don\u2019t have one!\u201d\u2018Of course!\u2019Hong recalled the memory of a family he had seen at one point but smiled. The black Dragon\u2019s eyes that were looking outside seemed empty.Hong smiled even brighter after seeing that his reflection was filling up those empty eyes.He heard a voice that was so monotone that no emotions seemed to be behind them at all.\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t have a birthday.\u201dIt was also fine to forget it.That was what Cale thought.\u2018However\u2026\u2019He recalled a memory from his past.Kim Rok Soo did not find his birthday to be important. He just remembered that it was the day he got seaweed soup at the orphanage and also the day that he received the suffocating hardship of becoming an adult and having to figure out his life outside the orphanage.\u2018Rok Soo.\u2019\u2018What is it?\u2019\u2018We\u2019re alive this year too.\u2019\u2018So?\u2019\u2018Ah, you dreary bastard! Are you going to act this cold toward me even on my birthday?\u2019But there was also a time when it had been special.But that was not because it was his birthday but because of the memories associated with it.\u201cIf you ask me for a reason as to why a birthday is a special day\u2026\u201dThe Cat siblings and the black Dragon looked at Cale.\u201cIt is because we are alive now.\u201dCale closed his eyes.\u201cIt can be special because we realize that we are still alive.\u201dRaon and Hong tilted their heads slightly. On slightly smiled while looking at the two of them tilt their heads in the same direction.Cale opened his eyes. He then looked at the night view outside the window as he spoke.\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be your birthday to have those days.\u201dWho cared if these vicious and scary three children didn\u2019t have birthdays or didn\u2019t know their birthdays?\u201cThen just make it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Make it?\u201dHong\u2019s ears twitched.\u201cYeah.\u201dHong slowly approached Cale. The black Dragon did not approach Cale but peeked at Cale.Hong hesitated for a moment before speaking. He recalled the child who received a present under the sunset.\u201cI, I am curious to know if I can really choose a random day as my birthday nya.\u201dThe black Dragon asked as well.\u201c\u2026Is that really okay?\u201dThey heard Cale\u2019s response immediately.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201dIt was a world where the King was celebrating turning 50. It was also a world where some bastards were going to terrorize the people using magic bombs on the same day.It was just them choosing an anniversary for themselves.Why would that be an issue?Cale looked at the children as if to ask what the issue with it was, before flinching.The black Dragon suddenly jerked his head up in an extremely odd manner. However, his neck was short and his face was round, making him look really funny.\u201cThen this Dragon will think about it.\u201dThe black Dragon did not choose a date right away.There were many dates he had not experienced yet.Of course, there was a day he wanted to choose.It was the day he first saw the night sky.However, an even better day might appear in the future. He wanted to think about it a little longer.\u201cI am going to make my own anniversary because I am great and mighty.\u201dHe was a great, mighty, and cautious Dragon.\u201cI want to do the same, nya!\u201dHong trotted over to his sister On and rubbed against her body as he spoke.\u201cYou should do it too, noona!\u201dAs On stood there without being able to answer\u2026\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dCale let out a deep sigh.\u201c\u2026By the way, are you all not going to sleep?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now, nya!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dOn watched Hong jump into the soft and warm bed and then Raon proudly raised his head while demanding some food before looking away. She looked at Cale\u2019s hair, which was sparkling like the sunset underneath the magic light, and then slightly lowered her head.She recalled a memory she had forgotten about for a long time.\u2018On, you were born after the rainy season as the summer arrived. The hot sun signaled the day you were born.\u2019Why did she suddenly recall this faint piece of memory from her extremely young days that she had not been able to remember until now?Was it because she was no longer on the run and didn\u2019t have to look away from such a harmonious sight?\u2018On, your brother was born. His name is Hong. Hong was born after the summer as the morning dew appeared on the leaves. I think that it will be good if our On sticks to Hong when he is cold and our Hong sticks to you when you are hot.\u2019Of course, she didn\u2019t recall the exact dates. She just remembered the warmth of those moments.On started to think.Even if it wasn\u2019t their birthdays, she thought that coming up with an anniversary to celebrate Hong and her being alive wouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201cI\u2019m curious, nya!\u201dHong rubbed his head against Cale\u2019s leg as he spoke.\u201cI\u2019m curious about everybody\u2019s birthdays, nya! I want to celebrate them, nya!\u201dOn\u2019s eyes lightly sparkled.On was curious about everybody\u2019s birthdays as well. She wanted to celebrate them. She wanted to celebrate them because they were alive together right now.Cale looked at Hong, who was stuck to his leg, with a stoic gaze, before nonchalantly commenting.\u201cAsk if you are curious.\u201d\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026\u2019Cale frowned after suddenly thinking about something.\u2018Does the House of Henituse do something for birthdays?Do they not do it for Cale because he is trash?More importantly, when is this Cale Henituse\u2019s birthday?Isn\u2019t that going to seem odd if I don\u2019t know that?\u2019Cale frowned as if this was going to be a headache.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll look into it later.\u2019It would be bad if he asked about his birthday to someone and they treated him as something even worse than trash because the capital bomb terror incident was coming up.He would take care of everything he needed to take care of before stealthily asking Deputy Butler Hans or Vice Captain Hilsman.He picked up a bell from the bedside table.Ring.Raon added on in a low voice as the bell chimed to summon Ron.\u201cGive me an extremely large steak.\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dIt was a night where he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.* * *\u201cThen we\u2019re going to pick that day?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, nya!\u201d\u201cSounds great!\u201dThe children averaging nine-years-old nodded their heads with serious expressions on their faces.\u201cThe human is a bit busy because of that motherfucking White Star so let\u2019s tell him a bit later!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, nya!\u201d\u201cWe will celebrate it really big!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very good, nya!\u201dThe children averaging nine-years-old who were now family, who were now part of this extremely large family, were finally able to choose an important day for them.\u201cIt was very hard!

(1)Posted on\u00a0July 11, 2022\u00a0by\u00a0admin\u00a0\u2014\u00a04 Comments \u2193At the time when King Zed\u2019s birthday celebration changed to a nightmare because of the Magic Bomb Terror Incident in the Roan Kingdom\u2026Something big had happened in the Breck Kingdom as well.\u201c\u2026You couldn\u2019t find traces of Rosalyn?\u201d\u201cThat is the case, your Majesty!\u201dThe king clenched the hand that was holding the throne as the head of the intelligence agency lowered his head with a stiff expression.Only the king and a few of his vassals were in the meeting room right now. The king did not hide his emotions.\u201c\u2026How, how could this be?\u201dPrincess Rosalyn had left from the Breck Kingdom and was headed toward the Magic Tower in the Whipper Kingdom.She contacted the royal family at least once a day. However, that had stopped at some point.The last thing they got from her was an emergency rescue signal.\u201c\u2026Roan.\u201d\u201cThat is the case, your Majesty.\u201dThe coordinates from where they received her last signal was in the Roan Kingdom.In order to go from the Breck Kingdom to the Whipper Kingdom, going through the Roan Kingdom was the quickest path unless they went through the Empire.\u2018\u2026Did the Roan Kingdom-?\u2019The king wondered for a moment if the Roan Kingdom had attacked Rosalyn, but he soon realized it was a useless thought.\u2018The Roan Kingdom has no reason to mess with a neighboring kingdom. That is a place that seeks peace unless somebody attacks them first.\u2019He was aware of the nature of the oldest kingdom on the continent. It was a kingdom that lived quietly if nobody attacked them, but it was an extremely disgustingly persistent kingdom that would survive through everything and go after anybody who attacked them.The Breck Kingdom was extremely aware of this as it was the oldest kingdom after the Roan Kingdom and the Jungle.\u2018Then what happened?\u2019No, most importantly\u2026\u2018Only a few people knew that Rosalyn was headed toward the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s Magic Tower.\u2019There was no way for a foreign kingdom to figure it out when only a few people within the Breck Kingdom knew about it.\u2018But that doesn\u2019t mean that there are no ways for them to figure it out.\u2019If one of those extremely few people from the inside leaked that information to a foreign kingdom\u2026\u2018Or if there are no connections to a foreign kingdom\u2026\u2019Furthermore, the fact that Rosalyn stopped contacting them\u2026\u2018Someone on the inside is responsible.\u2019Someone in the Breck Kingdom or maybe some faction in the kingdom must have attacked Rosalyn.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dThe head of the intelligence agency noticed the king\u2019s face darken and cautiously started speaking.\u201cIt is possible that only her magic video communication device was destroyed by a monster or a sudden unexpected situation.\u201d\u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d\u201c\u2026My apologies, your Majesty.\u201dUnlike the other vassals who were in here, the head of the intelligence agency was decently aware of Rosalyn\u2019s abilities. Furthermore, the people who left with Rosalyn were from the kingdom\u2019s shadow brigade and were skilled enough to even protect the king.Those people were taken down by a monster or couldn\u2019t contact them because of an unexpected situation?The chances of that were extremely low.The king sat on the throne and looked down at his vassals who did not dare to look at him and eventually spoke in a low voice.\u201cSend an official request for assistance to the Roan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, that!\u201dThe vassal from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently responded.\u201cThe entire continent might find out about this if something goes wrong! If that happens, the dignity of the kingdom-\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dBang!The king slammed his hand down on the throne.\u201cDo you think that I would say something like this without knowing that the dignity of the kingdom might fall or that it might open up some other issue with diplomacy?\u201dA kingdom\u2019s most likely candidate for the throne, who was almost at the point of being officially confirmed, had disappeared. They were uncertain as to whether she was alive or dead and the kingdom didn\u2019t even know where she was.The dignity of the kingdom would definitely fall if others found out about this, and if things went wrong, some kingdoms may send forces to find this potential future queen in order to negotiate or threaten the kingdom. It could even lead to even worse diplomatic situations for the kingdom.However, it had been a long time since they had been unable to contact her.Any longer\u2026The king could not leave this fact alone any longer.\u201cAm I doing this just to find my child?\u201dThe vassal urgently lowered his head after seeing the king\u2019s cold gaze. The king looked at the vassals who were his hands and feet and asked.\u201cWho is Rosalyn?\u201dThe Chief of Staff bowed and responded.\u201cShe is the future of the Breck Kingdom, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201dNobody here spoke up to oppose what the Chief of Staff said.The king was looking at Rosalyn, not as his daughter, but as the future of the Breck Kingdom.\u201cThis king, the former king, and the former queen before that\u2026 No, even if we go up a few more generations\u2026 There is no heir to the throne with Rosalyn\u2019s level of abilities.\u201dThe king was well aware of his own plate. He also knew about the former king, his father, and the queen before him, his grandmother.The royal family had not had anybody who had an especially talented brain or special ability.They had all had decent intelligence and average talents.Of course, they had been sincere people who had worked their hardest to maintain the kingdom well within their limits.However, they had been unable to raise the Breck Kingdom to an even higher level.However, Rosalyn\u2026That child\u2026\u201cThat child is a talented child. I\u2019m certain that she can raise the Breck Kingdom to new heights.\u201dThe Rosalyn that the king had observed had shown talent in Disciplines of Kingship and administration, but that child\u2019s talents did not stop there.Military science, tactics\u2026 And magic.The king thought about the areas in which Rosalyn\u2019s talents shone bright as well as the Western continent that had maintained peace for too long.\u2018A long period of peace is bound to bring forth something ominous.\u2019Of course, it was fine if something ominous like a war did not happen.In fact, it was even better if those kinds of situations did not appear.The king felt this way because he knew.As a father, he knew that Rosalyn was a warm person. That child would be able to add warmth to her wisdom to use it for maintaining the peace even longer.The king organized his thoughts and opened his mouth.\u201cAre you all scared of the Breck Kingdom\u2019s dignity falling?\u201dDignity falling temporarily was nothing.\u201cI am scared that the future of the Breck Kingdom would disappear.\u201dThe king was afraid of the future disappearing.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dThe head of Administration calmly responded.\u201cHowever, the citizens of the kingdom will fall into chaos if they learn that her highness is missing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201d\u201cI believe we need to deeply consider that aspect, your Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I understand.\u201dThe citizens of the Breck Kingdom called Rosalyn the rose of the sun and affectionately praised her talents and beauty.There was a moment of silence before the king gave his vassals an order.\u201cOne day. We will look for her one more day and look for a new direction if there are no changes.\u201dWith that, another meeting without any progress came to an end.* * *Screeeech.The king, who had been in his study alone, opened his mouth after hearing the door open.\u201cI said not to let anybody in-\u201d\u201cRoyal Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, it\u2019s you, John.\u201dFirst princess Rosalyn\u2019s younger brother, first prince John. The king straightened his shoulders and raised his head. But his shoulders slumped a bit again after seeing the concerned look in his child\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you okay, Royal Father?\u201dThe king weakly smiled at his son\u2019s gaze that was full of warmth like his mother\u2019s. He then shared a bit of his honest sentiments.\u201c\u2026It is a bit difficult. But I guess I can\u2019t let it show, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Royal Father.\u201dIf Rosalyn was like the sun, John was like the moon. He was someone who made you feel at peace when he was with you and someone you felt as if you could lean on.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you must be anxious as well and that I should not be showing this side to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Royal Father.\u201dPrince John understood why the king was like this right now.Maybe he was the only one for his father to lean on right now since his sister Rosalyn was not here. He would usually show this weak side to his mother and seek out her opinion for the typical issues, but he only showed his resolute self in front of her for this issue.John felt as if he could understand him a bit.\u201cBut, Royal Father.\u201d\u201cYes? You may speak.\u201d\u201cI have a slightly different thought.\u201dJohn closed his eyes.His struggling parents and his anxious younger siblings\u2026The chief executives who were at a loss for words\u2026The palace that was falling into chaos as the news about Rosalyn\u2019s disappearance slowly spread despite their best efforts to contain it\u2026His thoughts ended with his sister.His sister Rosalyn\u2019s face.\u201cRoyal Father. I\u2019m certain that my sister is alive and well.\u201d\u201c\u2026John.\u201d\u201cWe would have heard something about her in some shape or form by now if something had happened to her.\u201dIf it was his sister, his sister Rosalyn\u2026\u201cNo news is good news. You know what sister is like, Royal Father.\u201dIt was possible that John was more aware of his older sister\u2019s personality than his Royal Father.That was why John spoke honestly despite it potentially sounding a bit cold.\u201cSister\u2019s corpse has not been found.\u201d\u201cJohn, corpse?! How could you use such a word-?!\u201d\u201cThat means that she is alive, Royal Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026John.\u201d\u201cRoyal Father. Sister is definitely alive. She is probably looking for it.\u201dA gentle smile appeared on John\u2019s face.He then continued speaking to the king.\u201cSister should be looking into the reason or the evil person responsible for putting her in this \u2018missing\u2019 status. And once she finds it\u2026\u201dHe heard about how the citizens of the kingdom called his sister the rose of the sun.\u201cShe will definitely return.\u201dHowever, John did not agree with that.\u201cShe is that kind of person.\u201dShe was fire.His sister was like fire.Fire symbolized warmth to some but brought fear to others. She was that kind of person. She was more like the sun itself than the rose of the sun.\u201cRoyal Father. So please don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dJohn simply smiled despite noticing that the king seemed to take his words just as hopeful words to console him.\u2018John. Please take good care of things while I am gone.\u2019\u2018Please be safe, noonim.\u2019\u2018Oh come on. Do you really think that something would happen to me?\u2019John recalled the moment he said goodbye to Rosalyn before she left for the Whipper Kingdom.\u2018I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be. Of course, it\u2019s a different story if we are talking about you causing some issues\u2026\u2019\u2018\u2026John, you know me so well. It\u2019s amazing.\u2019How could he not know?He was probably the person who looked at Rosalyn\u2019s back the most and followed behind her.\u2018Noonim.\u2019That was why John knew what his sister was thinking and what she wanted.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dHe let out a deep breath to calm himself. He walked out of the king\u2019s study and headed toward his palace as he thought to himself.\u2018No matter what happened, please come back soon, noonim. Please come back before a seed of doubt inside me sprouts.\u2019He had shown a look of certainty in front of his Royal Father, but doubt was also roaming around a person\u2019s heart, looking for an opening to sprout.Squeeze.John pushed down on his chest with his hand before taking out his video communication device.He was waiting for Rosalyn\u2019s call.* * *That night, the night that the news about the Roan Kingdom\u2019s Magic Bomb Terror Incident reached the Breck Kingdom and all of the Western continent\u2026John stealthily went to visit his mother and father in the middle of the night.\u201cRoyal Father, Royal Mother!\u201dIt was rare to hear John\u2019s usually calm voice sound so urgent or excited.\u201c\u2026John?\u201dJohn pulled out a video communication device from his pocket as even the Queen looked at him in shock. The video communication device was already off but it was still warm as if it had been in use until just moments ago.\u201cNoonim called me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cR, really?\u201dJohn motioned to the Chief of Staff as the king and queen asked in shock. The king quickly snapped back to his senses and sent a signal to someone.Chhh-A thorough barrier was created around the area. John grabbed the king and queen\u2019s hands as he spoke.\u201cNoonim called from the Roan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cDid she really?\u201d\u201cWhat about her health? Did she seem okay?\u201dJohn gently clenched his hands to calm the king and queen who were throwing question after question at him.\u201cI thought that she looked healthy, Royal Mother. She said that she met a good friend and is in a safe place right now. However\u2026\u201d\u2018However?\u2019The king\u2019s heart sank at John\u2019s last word while the Queen\u2019s heart sank at John\u2019s now stiff face.John looked at his parents and calmly continued speaking.\u201cHowever, she asked me to keep her status a secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why would she\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe also said that she would be here soon. But she is going to travel in secret.\u201dJohn stopped talking for a moment before continuing.\u201cShe also asked if the Archduke was doing fine.\u201dThe king and the queen looked at John\u2019s eyes at that moment.They realized the emotions behind each other\u2019s gazes.Quietly\u2026Extremely stealthily\u2026The king\u2019s guards left the palace and started moving.This was the first time something like this had happened since the current king became king.* * *Clunk.The carriage gently rocked. The impact was faint, probably because this was a highest-grade carriage.\u201cRosalyn.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dRosalyn looked up from the document toward the person seated across from her. Choi Han was looking at the dark night sky as he spoke.\u201cI agreed to come because you said you needed help. But I haven\u2019t heard any details about our plan.\u201d\u201cMm. I guess that\u2019s true.\u201dRosalyn nodded her head and smiled after noticing Lock timidly looking at her.Choi Han and Lock.She was thankful that the two of them agreed to go with her to the Breck Kingdom without any hesitation.\u201cMm.\u201dRosalyn organized her thoughts and resumed speaking.\u201cFirst, the Breck Kingdom has one Archduke\u2019s household. It was given the title about 200 years ago. We\u2019re going to destroy it.\u201dAnd\u2026\u201cI\u2019m also going to abdicate my position as princess.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are they our field-side people from this group?\u201d\u201cYes, Director-nim.\u201dThe man called the Director nodded his head at his subordinate\u2019s confirmation and looked at the new employees who were separated into two groups.There was a line in the middle of this quite large hall and chairs were placed on both sides of the line.Right side body, left side head.Those were the titles for the two parts.The \u2018body\u2019 side had the new employees for the departments that use their bodies, such as going into battle.\u201c\u2026Is that Team 1 over there?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dThe corners of the Director\u2019s lips went up for some odd reason. He looked as if he was about to sneer.\u201cHand me the files.\u201d\u201cRight here, sir.\u201dThe secretary handed two files over without even needing an explanation.\u201cPffft.\u201d The Director chuckled.\u201cThe people for team leader Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s side are quite weird.\u201dTap. Tap. The Director observed the names of the two new employees assigned to Team 1.< Kim Rok Soo. >< Choi Jung Soo. >The Director shook his head after going through the two of their personnel records and interview notes.\u201cAigoo, it\u2019s going to be hard for Team leader Lee.\u201dThe corners of his lips were curled up contrary to his comments.The secretary peeked at the Director before looking away and starting to think.\u2018Funny bastard. You were the one who said to put all the good newbies with your damn lackeys. Why are you pretending that you don\u2019t know? You greedy son of a bitch.\u2019This was his superior, but the Director truly was an idiot.\u2018Do you really think trying to keep Lee Soo Hyuk in check will work?\u2019Team leader Lee Soo Hyuk.Although he was only a team leader because he chose to remain one in order to go out in the field, everybody inside and outside of the company knew the truth.Lee Soo Hyuk was the symbol of this company.\u2018\u2026But it really will be difficult for the team leader-nim this time.\u2019After looking at the personnel records, the secretary agreed that the lowest ranking newbies were assigned to Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s team.\u2018One is focused on martial arts and sword arts while the other is for rear support.\u2019Each team was assigned two to four newbies.This was a temporary placement and they were moved or could request to change teams based on a team\u2019s flair or style of doing things.\u2018Team leader Lee should have been assigned a minimum of four newbies.\u2019Even clueless newbies were necessary based on the amount of work that team did. However, they were assigned the minimum amount of two employees and those two were quite terrible as well.\u2018He is skilled in sword arts but he doesn\u2019t have any exceptional abilities he can use right now.\u2019Exceptional abilities were talking about strong attacks that could be used against enemies or monsters.\u2018Employee Choi Jung Soo doesn\u2019t have something like that.\u2019That was the reason he was determined to be a Grade 10 ability user. However, his physical abilities were great and he showed significant potential for growth.\u2018Haa\u2026 The other one-\u2019The problem was the other person, Kim Rok Soo.\u2018I think he chose the wrong team.\u2019The rear support that the \u2018body\u2019 side needed were supports that could be helpful for battle.However, this newbie, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s ability focused on records.\u2018He would be well-received if he went to guild inspections or government audits teams.Kim Rok Soo, who was close to the type of talent that the head side desperately needed, was not as useful on the body side.That was the reason the company suggested he chooses a department on the head side, but Kim Rok Soo was firm on requesting a body side department.\u201cHoohoo.\u201dThe secretary, who had been deep in thought, heard the Director laugh.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if the punks in Team leader Lee\u2019s team will be able to survive today\u2019s training.\u201d\u201cSir, are you talking about the hazing ritual?\u201dIt was tradition in the company to haze the new employees during orientation.\u201cYes. What if they get last place? It\u2019ll be terrible for Team leader Lee\u2019s face.\u201d\u2018You stupid idiot. Do you really think that Team leader Lee will care about something like that? Then he would have already moved up to become the Chairman of this company and fired your sorry ass.\u2019The secretary was grumbling internally but responded with a calm expression on his face.\u201cI hope everybody safely completes the hazing ritual without getting hurt.\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201dThe Director agreed with that. However, he clicked his tongue while looking at the two newbies on Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s team.\u201cTsk. One looks like a country bumpkin while the other looks completely out of it.\u201dThe secretary agreed with that.His eyes headed toward the person who was wearing a suit that was too large for him.Choi Jung Soo was looking around while touching the sleeves of his clothes.\u201cAhem.\u201dThe suit he bought in the thrift store did not look good. He looked around and noticed that the others\u2019 gazes were headed toward him and the person next to him.The gazes were not good.Their gazes were either wary of them as newbies to \u2018that Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s team\u2019 or curiosity.Screech. Choi Jung Soo moved his chair a bit to the side and started speaking.\u201cAhem, hem.\u201dHe was looking at the pale and skinny man who looked less undersized and more like a sharp blade.Choi Jung Soo\u2019s gaze headed toward the man\u2019s name tag.\u2018His name is Kim Rok Soo.\u2019Kim Rok Soo was the fellow newbie assigned to Team 1.Choi Jung Soo flashed his unique smile that made him seem like a good person. It was a bright smile that usually reminded people of a golden retriever.He looked quite harmless, especially because of the loose second-hand suit he had to buy to fit his tall height and wide shoulders.\u2018Mm.\u2019Choi Jung Soo flinched after making eye contact with Kim Rok Soo.\u2018They\u2019re like swords.\u2019Kim Rok Soo was no longer blanking out and was observing Choi Jung Soo with a sharp gaze.Choi Jung Soo gulped and said whatever came to his mind after seeing that gaze.\u201cOh! Are you my one and only fellow newbie on this team? I\u2019m Choi Jung Soo! Nice to meet you!\u201d\u201c\u2026Kim Rok Soo.\u201dKim Rok Soo continued speaking after a very long time.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dHe then added on.\u201cAre you the type who speaks informally despite meeting someone for the first time?\u201d\u201cHaha, hahaha.\u201dChoi Jung Soo\u2019s pupils started to shake. He then continued speaking as if it was no big deal.\u201cUmm, excuse me, Mr. Kim Rok Soo, are we both newbies on the same team? I think that we are the only two newbies for Team 1. So, my one and only fellow newbie? Hahaha.\u201dHowever, his voice cracked in the process. Kim Rok Soo just stared at him before slightly nodding his head.Choi Jung Soo held back a sigh after seeing that response.\u2018Ah, it seems like it\u2019ll be hard to get close to this guy.\u2019He subconsciously touched the scabbard of the sword around his waist out of habit.\u201cIt\u2019s different, Mr. Choi Jung Soo.\u201dHe heard Kim Rok Soo\u2019s voice at that moment.The voice that was neither loud nor quiet was indifferent. He could not feel any interest toward someone else in that tone.\u201cExcuse me? What is different-\u201d\u201cYour clothes.\u201dKim Rok Soo\u2019s dark brown eyes completely recorded Choi Jung Soo.\u201cYour outfit seems different from what you wore during the interview, Mr. Choi Jung Soo.\u201dKim Rok Soo\u2019s memory had recorded Choi Jung Soo differently from this slightly old-fashioned formal attire.The nice looking outfit, short and cleanly cut hair that was oiled back potentially for the interview made his innocent and bright personality seem a bit mature.However, the thick dark brown hair was longer than during the interview and it was naturally scattered, making him look much younger. Furthermore, the clothes were old-fashioned and loose, making his physique not look so good.\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dChoi Jung Soo was surprised that Kim Rok Soo remembered what he looked like during the interview, but he awkwardly smiled and scratched his head.\u201cI saw a building crumbling on my way back from the interview. I went there to help out and my clothes ended up a mess. Ah, I\u2019m so upset about all that money going to waste.\u201dCities were recreated after the cataclysm but some buildings would crumble every so often for all sorts of reasons.Kim Rok Soo observed Choi Jung Soo with an odd gaze before slightly nodding his head.\u201cYou did well, Mr. Choi Jung Soo.\u201dChoi Jung Soo\u2019s expression turned odd after hearing that nonchalant comment.\u2018He doesn\u2019t seem to be mocking me. Is it a compliment?\u2019Kim Rok Soo had said it too nonchalantly for it to be a compliment.Choi Jung Soo\u2019s eyes opened wide for a moment before he smiled. He looked at Kim Rok Soo, who had similar hair to his own, and started speaking.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Rok Soo. May I ask how old you are? Now that we are on the same team, we should get along-\u201d\u201cHmph. Same team my ass.\u201dHe heard someone speak in a mocking tone from the back.Choi Jung Soo looked behind him.He made eye contact with a man.\u2018He doesn\u2019t have a name tag?\u2019The company had told them to put name tags on but this person was not wearing one. The man was touching the tip of a short spear while looking extremely arrogant.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019-\u201dChoi Jung Soo opened his mouth before closing it. He wanted to say something but it was awkward to say anything.\u201cHmph.\u201dThe man scoffed.\u201cLet me give you a word of advice.\u201dThe man looked at Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo from head to toe before continuing to speak.\u201cToday\u2019s teams are temporary. The hazing ritual will soon happen. It is highly likely that we will be assigned to new teams based on the results.\u201dHe then scoffed again.\u201cIf you have no skills, you\u2019ll be sent to a terrible team. Then you should go to a good team if you have skills, right?\u201dKim Rok Soo peeked to his side.Choi Jung Soo\u2019s gaze was slowly getting sharper.\u2018At least he\u2019s not extremely dense.\u2019The man holding the short spear continued speaking as Kim Rok Soo had that thought.\u2018Team 1 is the figurehead of this company. I\u2019m curious to see how the teams will change based on the results of the hazing ritual.\u2019Choi Jung Soo subconsciously tightened his grip in the hand that was touching his sleeves.This man was clearly looking down at Choi Jung Soo\u2019s skills.\u201cWhat do-\u201dWhat do you mean by that?Choi Jung Soo was about to talk back.At that moment\u2026\u201cMr. Park Kyung Ho.\u201dKim Rok Soo turned around.\u201cAre you not going to put your nametag on?\u201dThe eyebrow of the man holding the short spear slightly rose. Kim Rok Soo\u2019s nonchalant gaze observed Park Kyung Ho.\u201cYou were holding a long spear during the interview but you have a short spear with you today.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know who I am?\u201dKim Rok Soo, who had been looking at the newbie for Team 2, who had not been wearing his nametag on purpose, tilted his head to the side.\u201cI only know your name and face.\u201d\u201cYou saw me before?\u201d\u201cI saw you at the interview when you went in after they called your name.\u201dKim Rok Soo tilted his head to the other side.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dThere were no problems.However, Park Kyung Ho had a weird feeling.Those oddly emotionless-looking eyes\u2026This gaze that seemed sharp but completely uninterested\u2026\u2018\u2026Was it a coincidence that he memorized my name?\u2019All departments had interviews on the same day so there were hundreds of people waiting there.It was because the company needed manpower for some things even if people did not have abilities.\u2018\u2026He wouldn\u2019t even have been in the same interview group as me if he was in rear support.\u2019Park Kyung Ho was feeling oddly iffy and opened his mouth to say something else.This was a situation where the other person knew who he was but he didn\u2019t know anything about that person.\u201cEverybody, please quiet down!\u201dAn employee, who looked like the moderator, appeared and the orientation started.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Lee Soo Hyuk!\u201d\u201cThe esteemed Healer of Earth is here too!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Director-nim?\u201dThe new employee started whispering.The team leaders of each department, and the CEO were walking into the auditorium prepared for the orientation.\u201cThat sir is Lee Soo Hyuk-nim-\u201dThe new employees who were holding swords were looking at Lee Soo Hyuk with respect and aspiration.Lee Soo Hyuk, who slowly walked into the auditorium looking drowsy, seemed bored. No, he seemed tired.The man who can slash through anything.The man who had survived multiple life-or-death situations since the early days of the cataclysm and saved many lives.Lee Soo Hyuk, whom they had all expected to have a high position in the government, was still working in the field as a team leader for the company.It might be because he was young, but there were many people who were drawn to him because of it.\u201cTeam leader Lee, your newbies seem to be over there.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk\u2019s gaze headed to the two new employees for Team 1.Pffft.\u201d\u201cHmm? Why are you suddenly laughing, Team leader Lee?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing.\u201dThey were the two new employees who were staring at him with gazes that seemed almost nonchalant amidst the field of new employees looking at him with aspiration, respect, or even envy.\u201cIt was true.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk, who had not been one of the interviewers, quietly observed Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo.Kim Rok Soo, the punk he had rescued in the early days of the cataclysm.Choi Jung Soo, who he had a short interaction with while facing an unranked monster in Seomyeon.For the two of them to grow this much and come here as new employees\u2026Smile.Lee Soo Hyuk smiled at the two of them.\u201cLook at these punks.\u201dHowever, the two of them, in sync, had turned away from him and looked forward.\u201cHa, haha-\u201d\u2018How entertaining.\u2019Lee Soo Hyuk couldn\u2019t help but laugh after seeing two people, who were polar opposites, reacting the same way.\u201cUmm, Team leader Lee. Will it be okay?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou know\u2026 Director Park messed with things.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk just shrugged his shoulders as another team leader whispered to him.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll find out after observing what happens today.\u201dThe MC shouted and the eyes of the new employees opened wide and a faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cOkay then, we will have a short test before the official orientation starts!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He calmly spoke while looking at the silver shield glowing through the video communication device.\u201cThe House of Henituse was originally the barrier to protect the Forest of Darkness and the family laid their roots in that spot to be the vanguard against the north.\u201dAlthough the family was famous for their money\u2026\u201cTheir start was as a martial arts family.\u201dThe start of this household was based on protecting and persisting.\u201cYour highness, still-\u201dIt was at that moment.\u2013 Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!\u2013 Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiing-They could hear the alarms going off in the Henituse territory through the video communication device.\u2013 Your highness! The enemies have started their invasion!Basen Henituse, who had been looking outside, urgently came over to report.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAlberu clenched his fists.Numerous black dots were quickly approaching from beyond the silver shield that was covering the sky.Those dots slowly started to reveal their figures.They were wyverns.The Wyvern Knights Brigade of legends had revealed itself.Alberu immediately started speaking.\u201cOpen the door!\u201dScreeech- Bang!The meeting room doors opened with loud noises.There were multiple doors to this room.Bang, bang, bang!In this octagon shaped meeting room\u2026A total of eight doors opened.A lot of people were silently observing the crown prince from beyond the doors.Strategy, finance, diplomacy, administration, capital defense, etc.Mid-level administrators for each field were focused and waiting for their orders.\u201cI will head out now, your highness!\u201d\u201cI as well, your highness!\u201dA few of the top-level administrators immediately stood up. They each had a video communication device connected to the Henituse territory in their hand.They all headed for different doors.Scribble scribble.The lowest ranking record keeper was seated next to Alberu as he quickly started recording.\u201cMm.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but gulp.He was not the only one.The top-level administrators for finance, administration, diplomacy, etc who were still by Alberu\u2019s side could not close their dropped jaws.\u201cAh!\u201dThe pen almost slipped out of the lowest ranking record keeper\u2019s hand. He looked down at his hand. It was full of sweat.\u2013 Baaaaaang\u2014!\u2013 Bang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang\u2014!The wyverns that were visible on the video communication device screen were launching attacks after attacks to destroy the shield protecting the Henituse territory.\u201c\u2026The Bear tribe!\u201dThe Minister of Foreign Affairs shouted those words before getting up and running toward an exit.He was headed toward the communication mage in charge of video communication devices connected to different parts of the Western continent along with some diplomats.\u201cDamn it, fuck!\u201dThe Minister of Finance, the oldest person in the room, subconsciously swore and the lowest ranking record keeper was working hard to record everything but his hand started shaking even more.It was at that moment.\u201cNot yet.\u201dAlberu Crossman finally started speaking.\u201cExcuse me?\u201dSomebody asked in confusion.However, Alberu spoke to himself instead of responding.\u201cThis is not the end yet.\u201d\u2018Yes, I\u2019m sure that Cale Henituse has prepared something.I know this bastard and he has yet to reveal his weapons.\u2019Alberu suppressed his anxiety and waited.He soon got a response to respond to his waiting.\u201cHahaha, my goodness.\u201dA Bone Dragon and numerous skeleton monsters. This was the start to the Henituse territory\u2019s counterattack against the Paerun Kingdom\u2019s Wyvern Knights Brigade.\u201cN, necromancer-!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re receiving calls from the temples!\u201dWhether they were covering their mouth or shouting in shock\u2026 Whether they were frantic from the calls coming from all over\u2026Alberu looked around him.He had made a promise to Cale.\u2018Your highness, the Henituse territory will ignore all communication from the temple starting this moment.\u2019\u2018I will take responsibility for it.\u2019The promise made regarding the necromancer\u2026\u201cI guess I have no choice but to take responsibility.\u201dOne of the vassals urgently spoke to the calm Alberu.\u201cYour highness! It is a necromancer! This, this-\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201dThe vassal, who had been raising his voice, could not say anything and simply opened and closed his mouth a few times after seeing Alberu\u2019s now cold and sunken demeanor.\u201cYour highness!\u201dAlberu nodded his head after seeing the Minister of Foreign Affairs\u2019 gaze.\u201cAs we prepared.\u201dAlberu had made preparations in advance as he said that he would take responsibility.\u201cYes, your highness!\u201dThe Minister of Foreign Affairs knew about it as well.One of the vassals who had been watching opened his mouth as if he could not hold it in any longer.\u201cYour highness, even if this is war, a necromancer-\u201dAlberu cut him off and asked.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cOr do you need to see our people die?\u201d\u201cE, excuse me?\u201dThe vassal could finally see that Alberu\u2019s eyes were now bloodshot.The face that had been radiant and gentle was no longer smiling and colder than anything he had seen.No, he looked vicious.\u201cThis is not the time for the Roan Kingdom to be cautious about what other people think. This is the time to do anything and everything in order to survive. That is the same for the Henituse territory.\u201dHe sternly spoke to the people looking at him.\u201cThe necromancer currently participating in the Battle at the Henituse territory is a precious individual. That power is being used to protect us. That is enough.\u201d\u201cBut the other nations and temples-\u201d\u201cNone of that is useful if the kingdom is destroyed. It is only a problem if we lose the war and the kingdom loses power. You should know more about world affairs than me, don\u2019t you?\u201dThe vassal who had spoken up closed his mouth.As the crown prince stated, nothing was useful if the kingdom was destroyed.Alberu looked at the vassal before recalling what Cale Henituse had told him.\u2018The entire kingdom will become heroes.\u2019Yes, the Henituse territory will not simply resist.They will be victorious.Alberu had hope as he immediately gave orders to the people in charge of the different fields.\u201cDeliver information to the northeast region without any delays!\u201d\u201cIgnore all contact from the temples except from the Temple of the Sun God!\u201d\u201cHave the northwest region and southeast region increase the urgency level for the troops on standby by one!\u201dScribble. Scribble.The record keeper\u2019s hand started moving faster. He needed to hurry to record the endless flow of information and could not rest despite using a magic device to help him.The record keeper could see that Alberu was extremely determined.\u201c\u2026Ho-\u201dHowever, the meeting room, no, the entire palace soon had a moment of silence.\u2013 H, hyung-nim-!Alberu could hear Basen Henituse\u2019s scream-like shout through the video communication device screen.Everybody had seen it.\u2018Baaaaaaaang!\u2019They heard a loud explosion and saw the aftershock of the explosion cover the video communication device screen.Then they saw Cale Henituse barely standing after stopping the enemy\u2019s intense attack.\u2018T, this is not a battle between humans!\u2019The record keeper next to Alberu felt suffocated.The enemy\u2019s immense strength\u2026Cale Henituse, who had stopped it\u2026\u2018This is beyond the scale of war I had imagined!\u2019The record keeper was certain that he was not the only one who was having this thought. This moment of silence was proof of it.\u2018Will they be able to protect the Henituse territory-\u2019And\u2026\u2018Will they be able to protect the Roan Kingdom? Will they be able to hold on?\u2019Young master Cale had persisted through the enemy\u2019s attack, but the war was not over. Furthermore, more enemies would come in the future.\u2018Will the Roan Kingdom be able to survive?\u2019The record keeper\u2019s body was getting stiff and he had even stopped recording.It was at that moment.\u201cBasen Henituse.\u201dHe heard a calm voice breaking the silence.The voice was dry but calm. It was Alberu Crossman.\u201cWhat did your hyung-nim order you to do?\u201dHe was speaking to Basen Henituse.However, everybody heard him clearly.\u201cIf you do not want to be embarrassed, no, if you do not want to regret this in the future, do not forget your task.\u201dThe record keeper\u2019s shoulders flinched.He subconsciously turned to look at Alberu.Red bloodshot eyes, dry expression, stiff face\u2026However, his eyes were still alive.The record keeper subconsciously clenched the hand holding the pen.\u201cThe First Brigade of the Royal Knights and the First Mage Brigade are to head to the Henituse territory.\u201dOf the eight open doors\u2026At the only door leading outside\u2026A Commander was standing beyond that door.\u201cAs you command, your highness!\u201dThe Commander bowed despite Alberu not directly giving him an order or even looking at him.The First Brigade of Royal Knights and First Mage Brigade will soon move efficiently to the Henituse territory.\u2013 Accurately relay how we win this battle.Basen\u2019s voice came through the video communication device and everybody turned toward Alberu.Alberu nodded his head and shared his will.\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Everybody do the things we have prepared.\u201dThe record keeper\u2019s hand moved faster and people started to quickly move.And finally\u2026\u2013 The shield did not break.The moment Cale Henituse\u2019s single comment echoed through the meeting room\u2026\u2018We did it! The Roan Kingdom has won!\u2019The lowest ranking record keeper couldn\u2019t hide his emotions and stopped recording to look at Alberu.\u2018Ah.\u2019However, those rising emotions sank as soon as he saw the look on Alberu\u2019s face.\u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dThey had just received news that enemy ships had passed through the first boundary of the northeast region.There would be another battle in the waters outside the Ubarr territory.Everybody looked at the crown prince.\u201cAs we prepared.\u201dThe crown prince made that single comment.He then spoke again a few moments later.\u201cThen we will be victorious. It will be just as Cale Henituse just proved to us.\u201dAlberu held the video communication device and headed toward the only spot with just one individual.It was the area currently being used as the crown prince\u2019s office.The lowest ranking record keeper had to follow behind the crown prince as his dedicated record keeper, but he picked up his pen first.He added one more sentence to everything he had recorded so far.< Crown prince Alberu Crossman will also prove it. >* * *Once a moment of peace finally seemed to arrive after numerous large and small battles\u2026\u201cThe coronation\u2026\u2026\u201dAlberu looked out the window after even Tasha left the room and he was alone.Puzzle City was a mess from the aftershock of the large battle.However, the footsteps of the people around the city seemed to be light, potentially because they had taken care of both the White Star and the sealed god.Alberu closed his eyes.\u2018Alberu Crossman. How about stepping up to this position now?\u2019\u2018By the way. Have your coronation in the spring.\u2019\u2018Spring\u2026\u2019\u201cPffft.\u201d Alberu scoffed.Knock knock knock-\u201cYour highness. It is me.\u201dAlberu opened his mouth.\u201cCome in.\u201dClick.The door opened and Alberu could see the lowest ranking record keeper standing behind his attendant.\u201cChester.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dThe lowest ranking record keeper approached Alberu with a magic pen in his hand.Chester, the lowest ranking record keeper, could see Alberu smiling as if he was a bit happy but a bit flabbergasted.\u201cChester. It looks like I will ascend the throne come spring.\u201dThe attendant and Chester flinched on their way in and stopped walking.Chester soon resumed walking and bowed once he was in front of Alberu.\u201cMay I record that moment?\u201d\u201cYou may.\u201dAlberu then smiled brightly once more.\u201cNow then, shall I take care of my next task?\u201dThe eyes that were looking forward once again toward the future were brimming with energy.Chester heard what the attendant cautiously said at that moment.\u201cI know it is early in the spring, but\u2026 What do you think about preparing for the coronation to be before your birthday, your highness?\u201dAlberu stared at the attendant and then mischievously responded.\u201cWell, that sounds childish, but\u2026 I like it.\u201dHe had a cynical yet mischievous smile.Chester and the attendant smiled gently.It only happened once every so often, but the crown prince now showed his true smile to the people around him instead of that fake radiant smile.The record keeper picked up his pen.He thought about a decent phrase to put as the starting line for the book he was personally recording which was not an official document.< The Roan Kingdom survived and Alberu Crossman, who was one of the main characters who made it happen, will become the true sun of the Roan Kingdom come spring. >\u2018No.\u2019The record keeper wrote a new statement.< Alberu Crossman is already the sun of the Roan Kingdom. >< Everybody is looking forward to the moment when the sun will rise. >\u2013 Side Story 3. Don\u2019t mess with the crown prince. End \u2013\u2013 The next side story is, \u2018It\u2019s snowing? That\u2019s right!

Kim Rok Soo sighed after taking a look and was about to open his mouth when the emcee started speaking.\u201cYou all know where this is, right?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but gasp.The auditorium that the orientation was taking place\u2026This place was quite far from the company.\u201cIs it possible-\u201dChoi Jung Soo looked at Kim Rok Soo who calmly opened his mouth to speak after noticing the gaze.\u201cIf it is a hazing ritual, it is probably a search.\u201dHe looked at the auditorium entrance and added on.\u201cThis is one of the destroyed lands.\u201dDestroyed land.That was the term given to an area where civilization had not been restored properly after monsters had rampaged through it.There were quite a lot of places like that within Korea.\u201cAs you all know, this is one of the destroyed lands.\u201dThe MC gently addressed the talkative new employees.\u201cI\u2019m sure you all saw it on your way here, but an auditorium has been built and a few new buildings are being built outside.There was only one thing that could mean.\u201cThankfully, this is an area that has returned to human territory.\u201dMonsters lived in the destroyed lands.The humans who lived in new central cities based around the shelters were slowly recovering the destroyed lands around the city.This land with the auditorium was one of those places where humans had pushed the monsters out and were reconstructing a city.\u201cThe ones on the \u2018Head\u2019 side will be tasked to go through documents related to the reconstructions.\u201dThe MC then looked toward the \u2018Body\u2019 side.\u201cAs for all of you here, you will be doing a treasure hunt.\u201dThe mission given to the new employees\u2026\u201c\u2026A treasure hunt?\u201dChoi Jung Soo looked confused while Kim Rok Soo\u2019s eyes clouded over.\u201cEverybody here is talented and has all sorts of abilities but we cannot send you to complete missions right away.\u201dThat meant that they could not be placed in battle right away. That was why they were going to give them a different sort of \u2018mission\u2019 to check out their abilities.The MC sternly but gently continued speaking.\u201cThere used to be many important public institutions around this auditorium.\u201dThe traces of a city and its records were important for a city reconstruction.\u201cSince we have already pushed monsters out of this area, you will move based on your teams to find something that might be helpful to the city reconstruction.\u201dChoi Jung Soo heard a mumbling voice.\u201cHmm. They want us to search?\u201d\u201cHow boring.\u201dThe person who was saying that it was boring was a familiar voice.\u2018Was his name Park Kyung Ho?\u2019A bitter smile appeared on Choi Jung Soo\u2019s face.\u2018I personally didn\u2019t want to fight starting the first day.\u2019A search was much better. He did not want to see blood from the first day, regardless of whether it was human or monster blood.The emcee continued speaking.\u201cWe will rank you all in the treasure hunt based on the value of the item you bring back. The judging will be by the team leader-nims of the different teams who have gathered here.\u201dThe new employees turned to look at their team leaders.Boom.The emcee stomped his foot and gathered their gazes again.\u2018Mm.\u2019Choi Jung Soo flinched after seeing the stiff look on the emcee\u2019s face. He finally saw that the emcee\u2019s hands that were covered in scars. This person also seemed to be part of a battle squad.\u201cThe most important thing is safety.\u201dThe emcee sternly spoke to the new employees of the Body side.\u201cYou cannot go into any buildings that look as if it may crumble. You will be removed from the ranking if you get hurt. Basically, it means that you are disqualified.\u201dHer emphasized and emphasized it again.\u201cYou can return empty handed so please keep safety as the number one priority.\u201d\u2018Safety.\u2019Kim Rok Soo reaffirmed that word in his mind as he slightly nodded his head.\u2018Safety is important.\u2019Of course, he had no idea what that clueless looking guy next to him, the person he would be moving as a pair with today, was thinking.\u201cThe time limit is until 2pm today.\u201dIt was currently 10am.\u201cThen please safely work hard. See you all at 2pm safe and sound.\u201dThe emcee raised his hand.\u201cAnd go!\u201dBEEEEEEEEEP\u2014They heard a buzzer go off somewhere.\u201cWe\u2019re starting right away?!\u201d\u201cThen do we need to go to our department? I thought we needed to look at documents?\u201dSearch and office work. The new employees who had received their respective duties were basically all talking, causing chaos inside the auditorium.Choi Jung Soo slowly got up.\u201cThe person who is the quickest is going to win! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s hurry!\u201dMany of the new employees had gathered with their teams and were headed out of the auditorium.\u201cUhh\u2026mm\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment Choi Jung Soo wondered what he should do and turned toward Kim Rok Soo\u2026\u201cStupid fools. Can\u2019t they tell?\u201dPark Kyung Ho chuckled and spoke to the other newbie on his team.\u201cShall we go? Just trust me.\u201d\u201cYou seem to have a plan?\u201d\u201cIt is obvious what you should do in such a test.\u201dShh. Park Kyung Ho turned to look at Choi Jung Soo.\u201cWell, I guess there are some people who are completely clueless.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.\u201dA woman in the rear support squad who had a nametag that said that her name was Choi Soo-In, apologized to Choi Jung Soo with her gaze before pulling Park Kyung Ho out of the auditorium.\u201cMm.\u201dChoi Jung Soo looked to the side.\u201cWhat should we do, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201dHe turned his head to see Kim Rok Soo quietly sitting on the chair with his eyes closed.Tap. Tap. His index finger was tapping on his knee.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201dKim Rok Soo finally slowly opened his eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201dHe then stood up.\u2018He\u2019s taller than I expected.\u2019Choi Jung Soo\u2019s eyes opened wide at the taller than expected but feeble Kim Rok Soo. His clear and dark black eyes looked into Kim Rok Soo\u2019s dark brown eyes.\u201cUmm, Mr. Rok Soo? Where are we going?\u201dChoi Jung Soo shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWe can\u2019t just go out without thinking it through. I think we need to set a target before we start searching.He slowly pointed to Kim Rok Soo\u2019s watch.\u201c4 hours is pretty short for searching. I wonder if we should narrow our search radius and focus on a specific area, Mr. Rok Soo.\u201dKim Rok Soo\u2019s eyes clouded over.Unlike this guy\u2019s good-guy appearance that made him seem as if he would be happy about everything, his suggestion was quite smart.\u201cYour suggestion is true too, Mr. Choi Jung Soo.\u201d4 hours. It might seem like a long time, but\u2026It was an extremely short period of time to search the remains of a destroyed city rampaged through by monsters.This was especially true because it was a place that was barely starting its reconstruction. It was extremely likely that most of, no, all of the new employees had visited this area for the first time since it was destroyed.A place they were visiting for the first time.A city that was completely destroyed where they could not tell what was what\u2026They were supposed to simply find some unspecified \u2018important items\u2019 in such a combination?It was highly likely that they would return empty-handed.\u201cMr. Rok Soo.\u201dChoi Jung Soo immediately continued speaking once it sounded as if Kim Rok Soo agreed with him.\u201cThen how about we pick a direction?\u201d\u201cNo, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cWe will do a large area search.\u201d\u201cNo, that-\u201dThat\u2019s difficult?Choi Jung Soo scowled. Kim Rok Soo had just agreed with his suggestion but said the opposite and wanted to do a large area search.It was highly like to amount to nothing.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cI remember it all, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dKim Rok Soo closed his eyes again.Numerous images flashed through his mind.These records of incidents were things he needed in order to participate as rear support for a battle squad as he didn\u2019t have any proper battle abilities.He recorded as many things as possible.\u201cI know the map of this area prior to its destruction.\u201dKim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo made eye contact.\u201cThe subway routes, government offices, local businesses, and residential areas\u2026 I know them all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201dChoi Jung Soo blankly asked back.\u201cDid you live here in the past, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cPffft.\u201dKim Rok Soo chuckled at Jung Soo\u2019s clueless face and shook his head.\u201cMy ability is called Record. It is related to memories.\u201dPat.Kim Rok Soo gently patted Choi Jung Soo\u2019s shoulder before heading toward the auditorium door. Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo were the only ones left in the auditorium now.\u201cI memorized the area nearby since they said that there was a company auditorium out here.\u201dKim Rok Soo motioned with his head to Choi Jung Soo who was not moving.\u201cShall we go?\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dChoi Jung Soo gasped in awe.\u201cWow. That\u2019s amazing, Mr. Rook Soo. You just happened to see them all in advance.\u201dKim Rok Soo responded nonchalantly as if it was nothing.\u201cI need to do this to-\u201dHe stopped talking at that moment.\u2018I need to do this to survive.\u2019He then continued speaking.\u201cI must do it like this.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dChoi Jung Soo could see Kim Rok Soo looking around once he exited the auditorium.There was just a bunch of wreckage outside the auditorium.Kim Rok Soo then spoke in a casual tone.\u201cCity Hall is 3km away in the 3 o\u2019clock direction. It is quite far but why don\u2019t we start there and walk in an oval-shape back to the auditorium?\u201d\u201cYes, that sounds good, huh?\u201dKim Rok Soo walked to the back of the auditorium and came back with something.\u201c\u2026You have a lot of luggage, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201dThat something was a backpack.Kim Rok Soo, who was carrying this backpack that had quite a lot of things dangling from it as if it was nothing, calmly spoke.\u201cI am weak so I need a lot of things in order to survive.\u201dThe corners of Choi Jung Soo\u2019s lips oddly curled up after hearing that.\u201cIs that sword all you have, Mr. Jung Soo?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Rok Soo.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cI like this.\u201dChoi Jung Soo quietly mumbled to himself and quickly followed behind Kim Rok Soo.There were people watching them as well.On top of a building barely maintaining its shape not too far from the auditorium\u2026The people there were looking down.\u201cWow. Team 1\u2019s newbies seem a bit special, don\u2019t they? Look at that bag and how they are starting last.\u201dTeam 3 leader looked at Lee Soo Hyuk and laughed mischievously. Lee Soo Hyuk shrugged his shoulders while Team 3 leader sighed and started walking.\u201cI will be heading out first then. \u201cHaaa, why do we even do this hazing ritual? The team leaders suffer more than the newbies.\u201d\u201cI agree. But it\u2019s nice to see many sides of the newbies, don\u2019t you think?\u201dTeam 4 leader followed behind him while responding.\u201cHalf of my team\u2019s newbies just recently awakened their abilities. I\u2019m worried. They might make a fool of themselves. Haaa, I\u2019ll be heading out too then.\u201dTeam 5 leader left as well.\u201cThen me too.\u201dThe other team leaders followed one by one as well. Each team leader was headed in the direction that their newbies headed in.The team leaders would follow the newbies today to figure out their disposition and chances of cohesion while guaranteeing their safety.\u201cBut Team 2 leader-nim.\u201d\u201cYes, Team leader Lee?\u201dTeam 2 leader and Lee Soo Hyuk, the Team 1 leader, had not left yet.\u201cAre you sure that all monsters have left this area?\u201d\u201cYes, Team 2 leader-nim. They have not noticed any monsters in the past week.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShaaaaaaaaaaa-There was a gust of wind.Lee Soo Hyuk pushed back his hair that was fluttering in the wind and closed his eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wind right now.\u201d\u201cThere sure is. I wonder if it is going to rain.\u201dTeam 2 leader watched the grey clouds in the distance getting closer and scratched her cheeks as if it was going to be annoying.\u201cWe should stop the search immediately if it rains.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cShall we go together, Team leader Lee?\u201dShe looked at Lee Soo Hyuk, whom she had no idea what he was thinking, and asked.\u201cIt looks like both the newbies of Team 1 and Team 2 are headed in the same direction.\u201d\u201c\u2026They must be heading for City Hall, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It seems that way.\u201d Our team\u2019s newbie, Mr. Park Kyung Ho, is originally from here. He said that his father used to work in City Hall. He probably headed that way.\u201dTeam 2 leader smiled brightly but her face was full of concern.\u201cMr. Park Kyung Ho did decide on a good direction, but, mm.\u201dCity Hall was the first place in this city where they had pushed the monsters out.That was why it was okay to relax.However\u2026\u201cBoth of the newbies on my team have good abilities but basically have no real experience. I\u2019m worried.\u201d\u201cThen we should go.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk started moving and Team 2 leader set aside her concerns and followed behind him.* * *\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would think that this is City Hall.\u201dChoi Jung Soo was following behind Kim Rok Soo while gasping about the building he was slowly starting to see.This City Hall was pretty large with the main building and multiple annexes. The annexes were either all destroyed or had disappeared without any traces while the main building was about half destroyed, making it difficult to tell that this was City Hall.\u2018Ah, this was a large building.\u2019 That was about the most anybody would think about it.\u201c\u2026And it looks like there is someone else who knows that this is City Hall.\u201dChoi Jung Soo walked in front of Kim Rok Soo with an awkward look on his face. Kim Rok Soo watched Choi Jung Soo walking forward with a hand on his scabbard before slightly frowning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s right! The flowers are also blooming! (1)Posted on\u00a0June 20, 2022\u00a0by\u00a0admin\u00a0\u2014\u00a07 Comments \u2193Malice was the first thing Raon learned about humans.Evil was a natural existence in humans as Raon noticed for a few years after that.However, the reason Raon was able to get out of that small and dark cave was because of a human\u2019s goodwill or perhaps goodness.That was the moment when Raon slowly started to realize that humans couldn\u2019t be so easily defined.* * *Raon had seen the following information while reading a fairy tale called < The First Snow is Soft! > as the kind Rosalyn taught him how to read.< The little bear looked happy while rolling down the hill which was covered in very soft snow. >< The little bear\u2019s friend, Tiggy, had told him that the large snowflakes that fall from the sky are cold when they touch your skin but that looking at them makes you feel soft and fluffy. >The world that Raon saw until he was four years old was completely dark. Of course there was food and people who were covered in numerous colors, but the world that Raon saw when he was left alone was dark and black.< The little bear's eyes opened wide after seeing the completely white world! >A completely white world\u2026The little bear in the fairy tale had a big smile on his face while looking at the world covered in white snow.\u2018Rosalyn! Can I have this?\u2019\u2018Of course, Raon-nim. You can have it.\u2019Raon really liked this book for some reason.Of course, books like \u2018The Great History of Dragons,\u2019 \u2018The Hero and his Dragon Friend,\u2019 \u2018The History of War,\u2019 \u2018War and Peace,\u2019 \u2018\u2019Skills for Fighting,\u2019 \u2018Warrior, His Great Name\u2019 were fun and interesting as well, but Raon was oddly drawn to this white picture.Some time had passed since then and it was now early December.Raon, who was staying at the residence in one corner of Harris Village, slammed on the table with both front paws.Bang! Bang!\u201cThat\u2019s what the little bear said! To be more specific, the author of this fairy tale said that about snow!\u201dHong looked at the white picture in the open < The First Snow is Soft! > and slowly lowered his tail.\u201cMm.\u201dHong peeked at Raon, whose eyes were sparkling from excitement, and mumbled with an expression that seemed to be saying that he could not understand why Raon was like this.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t like snow because it is cold.\u201dHe then peeked at his sister On.On must not have heard him because he mumbled extremely quietly as she was still focused on the white picture in the fairy tale.Hong looked at the focused On and pouted.\u2018The sky is cloudy.\u2019The snow that he had seen a few times while staying in the Cat Tribe village had been similar to rain that came down from the ash-colored sky.The snow did not pile up like this picture here. In fact, the ground was stickier than when it rained and the snow quickly became dirty and black.\u2018\u2026But I did see something similar to this picture before.\u2019The winter he experienced after running away from the village with his sister but before they arrived at the Henituse territory\u2026 That was the one time Hong had seen a completely white world similar to what was drawn in this fairy tale.The snow he saw at that time was different from rain as it came down in large and formed snowflakes.\u2018But the sky was still just as cloudy.\u2019However, Hong could not keep his eyes open to look at the view because of the cold gusts of wind blowing with the snow.It was too cold.He might have frozen to death if his sister had not been there.Hong subconsciously mumbled.\u201cWinter is cold\u2026 and it is hard to find food\u2026 so I don\u2019t really like it.\u201dIt was at that moment.Tang-!Hong heard something fall down.The black Dragon and two kittens quickly moved to where they heard the noise.\u201cBeacrox, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYou need to be careful with knives, nya!\u201dTap.The kitten-form On gently jumped down from the table and walked over to Beacrox.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBeacrox was frowning.He looked at his palm in disbelief before looking at On for a moment after hearing her question and stoically responding.\u201c\u2026Pay no attention.\u201dHong then shouted with a bright expression on his face.\u201cHe seems to be fine, nya!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, Beacrox! Make sure to get some rest if you are tired!\u201dOn nodded her head as well and returned to the top of the table where Hong and Raon made their comments. She then spoke to Raon and Hong.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should keep talking here, nya. Let\u2019s go up.\u201d\u201cSounds great!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dRaon tightly clenched the fairy tale with both front paws and flew up while Hong\u2019s tail was wagging side to side as he followed behind On.\u201cLet\u2019s go to our room!\u201dBeacrox knew that the \u2018our room\u2019 Raon was shouting was not their respective rooms but Cale\u2019s room, but he did not correct them.\u201c\u2026Ha!\u201dHe simply let out a sigh-like scoff before bending over to pick up the fallen kitchen knife.He could see his face reflected on the sleek and sparkling cold blade.He had a terrible scowl on his face.The extremely weak and grumbling yet oddly sad voice echoed in his ears.\u2018Winter is cold\u2026 and it is hard to find food\u2026 so I don\u2019t really like it.\u2019Beacrox just placed the kitchen knife on top of the chopping board and took off his glove.\u201cFuck.\u201dHe touched his ear.He heard a nonchalant voice at that moment.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dIn this villa kitchen, aside from On, Hong and Raon\u2026 There were two more people in addition to Beacrox.\u201c\u2026Yes sir. I am fine.\u201dBeacrox casually responded.\u201c\u2026Well, then that\u2019s good.\u201dCale nodded his head with an extremely stoic face.Cale had been sitting on the chair right in front of the table On, Hong, and Raon had been at until just a moment ago.\u201cShould I get you some more honey lemon tea, young master-nim?\u201dBehind Cale was Ron, who was looking at him with an extremely gentle smile.\u201c\u2026Not r-\u201d\u201cPlease drink more.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dCale received a teacup from Ron.He then looked at the empty table once again with an extremely iffy look on his face.He then turned his head.Cale could see the extremely clear and blue sky that did not seem proper for early winter past the kitchen window.\u201cMm.\u201dSimilar to crown prince Alberu\u2019s face when Cale was smiling extremely brightly\u2026 The look on Cale\u2019s face was just about as stoic and iffy.\u201cMm.\u201dCale groaned and Ron watched him with a benign smile on his face. He slightly turned his gaze. His son Beacrox had stopped what he was doing and was now making some dough with flour. He seemed to be thinking about making some cookies.\u2018Snow.\u2019Ron\u2019s eyes that had been looking at Cale and Beacrox sunk low.He could see the blue sky as well.\u201cOh.\u201dCale gasped at that moment.A few of Mary\u2019s skeleton monsters were showing off their white bones as they flew around.Crunch crunch.Cale ate some cookies that were baked yesterday while blankly looking at the blue sky and the skeleton monsters.Cale, who had been lying back on the chair as if it was a bed, opened his mouth.\u201cRon.\u201d\u201cYes, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cDoes the Lord\u2019s Castle have an annual record of the weather?\u201d\u201cIt does.\u201d\u201cTell Hans to get the weather information for the past ten years-\u201dCale looked toward Ron for a moment while giving that order.\u2018Mm!\u2019He then flinched. An extremely benign smile was on Ron\u2019s face. Cale looked away after feeling as if he saw something he should not see and frowned even more.\u201cYoung master-nim!\u201dHe heard a loud shout from behind the window.The Wolf children and Lock had their arms high in the air to greet Cale.Cale, who was frowning while looking at the Wolf children, who were wearing short sleeves despite it being early winter, and gasped.\u201cAh.\u201dChoi Han, who did not have the slightest amount of dust on him, was walking toward him from beyond where the Wolf children were standing.\u201cThe statistic is right there.\u201dHarris Village. The person who knew the most about the weather around the Forest of Darkness was walking right in front of him.\u201cHaaaa. So annoying.\u201dCale slowly got up and headed toward the door.This was the first time he was heading out in five days.Ron silently came over and put a blanket over him.\u2018\u2026Scary old man.\u2019Cale got chills at his stealthiness but chose not to look at Ron before heading toward the door.\u201cMy goodness! The young master-nim is finally outside\u2026\u2026!\u201dCale completely ignored Deputy Butler Hans\u2019 comment and walked toward Choi Han, whose eyes were wide open.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dChoi Han soon greeted Cale with a solemn look on his face.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dCale let out a deep sigh. Choi Han had not seen Cale sighing like this with a serious look on his face for a while.The deep wrinkles on Cale\u2019s face from frowning reminded Choi Han of that time.When Ron had lost his arm because of Arm and was poisoned with mermaid poison\u2026It was just like that time.\u2018Mm.\u2019Choi Han\u2019s gaze sank some more.Choi Han saw Beacrox peeking his head out of the door past Cale\u2019s shoulder.He had also never seen that guy acting like this.\u2018\u2026Something\u2019s odd.\u2019Choi Han quickly checked Ron and Cale\u2019s conditions. Both were fine.\u2018So why is that bastard Beacrox acting like this?\u2019\u201cChoi Han.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Cale-nim.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s mouth was going dry. Lock and the Wolf children were anxiously looking at Cale as well.Cale didn\u2019t care and looked at Mary, who was headed his way with her Flying Skeleton Brigade and nonchalantly asked.\u201cWhen does it usually snow for the first time in the Forest of Darkness?\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dCale brushed his face with both hands as Choi Han blankly asked back.\u201c\u2026My goodness.\u201d\u2018I have to do all sorts of things as I live-.\u2019Cale could not say anything and just turned stoic. Choi Han blinked a few times before seeing the fishy smile on Ron\u2019s face and realized that it must be something good.That was why he responded.\u201cMm. It is early December right now. Based on what I experienced\u2026.\u201dThe Forest of Darkness. No human had lived in this area longer than Choi Han.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be weird if it snowed at any moment.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIt could snow right now. It might not snow until a month later. It might even snow overnight while we are sleeping.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cYes, Cale-nim.\u201dIt was at that moment.Plop.Choi Han heard something fall.He turned his head to see that Raon had dropped a small book from his paws. On quickly picked it up but Raon spoke to Choi Han with an extremely urgent look on his face.\u201c\u2026Smart Choi Han, it can snow while we are sleeping?\u201d\u201cYes? Mm, I think that the first snow for the past few years always came during night time. Or at least after the sunset.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right! Of course it could do that!\u201dRaon flew back into the building with an extremely serious look on his face.\u201cAh, my head.\u201dCale shook his head as if this was giving him a headache.\u201cCale-nim?\u201dChoi Han looked at Cale with confusion as he didn\u2019t know why Cale was acting like this, but Cale walked extremely slowly to the kitchen instead of responding.Choi Han looked at him for a bit before receiving a cold glare from Beacrox.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with him?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201dRon smiled gently and walked past Choi Han to keep up with Cale.Choi Han still did not know what was going on after seeing Ron\u2019s mood turn sour so quickly.Everybody had just considered this to be a small issue until this moment.Nobody seemed to have noticed Raon\u2019s intense desire.\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201dRaon\u2019s chubby cheeks were puffed up as he thought about the contents of the fairy tale.< The little bear walked up to his mommy and daddy. \u201cMommy, daddy! The first snow is here! Let\u2019s go make some snowmen of our family!\u201d \u201cSure, let\u2019s do that.\u201d \u201cSounds good! Should we make a snowman looking like our little bear first?\u201d The bear family made three snowmen and the happy snow bear family standing on top of the white world maintained their form without melting away all winter long. >Raon was in his room that Cale had given him but he had never used and turned on the video communication device.\u2013 Raon-nim?\u201cNice to see you, little Rosalyn.\u201dHe was talking to the good and smart Rosalyn.\u201cGood and smart Rosalyn, there is something I am curious about.\u201dRosalyn, who was currently in the Breck Kingdom negotiating an alliance between the Roan Kingdom and Breck Kingdom right now, was a bit tired but smiled brightly.She had never received a call like this from Raon.Rosalyn couldn\u2019t help but smile as the round dark blue eyes looked at her.\u2013 Yes, Raon-nim. What are you curious about?\u201c\u2026I only know how to destroy things. I know how to do things that can cause a lot of damage, but soft things are hard.\u201d\u2013 Excuse me?\u201cHow do you make soft snow?\u201d-\u2026Excuse me?Rosalyn, who was tired from her official duties, subconsciously got chills on her back while looking at the young Dragon\u2019s gaze that was burning hot with passion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did they know about this place?\u201dPark Kyung Ho grumbled in such a loud voice that it was hard to think that he was talking to himself.He then walked over to Choi Jung Soo.\u201cWe are going to search here so why don\u2019t you go somewhere else?\u201d\u201cAh, Mr. Kyung Ho.\u201dHis companion, Choi Soo-In, tried to stop him, but Park Kyung Ho was still looking at Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo with a disapproving gaze.\u2018I wanted to learn under Team leader Lee Soo Hyuk-nim.\u2019Park Kyung Ho had become an ability user half a year ago. His ability was given quite high marks and he was immediately designated as a Grade 4 user.This was quite a good start.After that, he trained and practiced quite a bit to come into this company and his efforts paid off when he was hired on the first try.That was why he had been pretty certain that he would be in Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s team.Lee Soo Hyuk was one of the first multiple ability users.Only the warriors among warriors were said to be in his team.That was why it only made sense for that position to be his.\u2018But these two are going to be under him?\u2019He especially did not like Choi Jung Soo, who was clearly not a rear support member and would be in the battle squad.\u201cMm. We were planning on starting our search here as well.\u201dChoi Jung Soo scratched his head.\u201cThe main building is quite large so why don\u2019t we split it in half and half to search?\u201d\u201cWhy should we do that? We were here first so the respectful thing to do would be for you to go somewhere else.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dChoi Jung Soo could not hide the awkwardness he was feeling in this situation. The supporter in Team 2 was feeling the same way. She knew it would be great if Team 1 left but Park Kyung Ho\u2019s attitude was quite shameful to watch.\u201cI understand.\u201dKim Rok Soo moved next to Choi Jung Soo at that moment.\u201cWe will look through the annex before going somewhere else.\u201dPark Kyung Ho scowled at the stoic response but did not say anything else. He quickly turned around and headed for the City Hall building.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Miss Soo-In.\u201d\u201cO, okay.\u201dShe bowed toward Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But this is a competition, so I trust that you will understand. It is true that we got here first.\u201d\u201cHo.\u201dChoi Jung Soo gasped before turning his head.\u201cWill it be okay, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cWho knows, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201dKim Rok Soo responded as if he didn\u2019t care much for it and looked around.\u201cTo be honest with you, I was not expecting to find anything in City Hall.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cThe government or a guild would have gone through City Hall first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then?\u201d\u201cThere was a famous architect\u2019s office around here. I heard that he was preparing the model for a new City Hall.\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d\u201cThe judicial scrivener and tax accountant office buildings seem to have maintained their form as well so we can look around it.\u201dChoi Jung Soo looked at Kim Rok Soo, who seemed to be in his early to mid twenties like himself, and blankly asked.\u201c\u2026How do you know such things?\u201d\u201cThere will always be records somewhere.\u201dKim Rok Soo didn\u2019t even look at City Hall or the annex before walking around it.\u201cWow.\u201dChoi Jung Soo gasped in admiration before following behind him.\u201cWow. Seriously\u2026\u201dHe gasped in admiration a few more times before quietly mumbling to himself so that Kim Rok Soo could not hear.\u201cI should be good friends with this guy.\u201dKim Rok Soo suddenly stopped walking at that moment.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Choi Jung Soo flinched, wondering if Kim Rok Soo had heard his mumbling. He slowly walked over to Kim Rok Soo, who was standing stiff while looking down.\u201cUmm, Mr. Rok Soo. What I said was-\u201d\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go to City Hall, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Jung Soo found this comment to be odd and stood next to Kim Rok Soo.\u2018Mm.\u2019He then flinched for a different reason from earlier.Kim Rok Soo\u2019s gaze was even sharper than before. He was cowling while looking down.Choi Jung Soo looked down as well.\u201cHuh? The bugs\u2026\u2026?\u201dAnts and other bugs were moving in a long line.He had seen ants do this before, but it was his first time seeing all sorts of bugs doing this.Kim Rok Soo\u2019s gaze slowly moved and Choi Jung Soo\u2019s gaze followed.\u201c\u2026That is-\u201dThe bugs were all leaving from around City Hall in this long line.The bugs were running away.\u201cWhat the heck?\u201dChoi Jung Soo felt an unexplainable sensation. His back became cold.This was anxiety.He was anxious because he felt as if something, something bad, was about to happen.\u201cMr. Rok Soo, why are all of the bugs running away from City Hall?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all bugs, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dKim Rok Soo\u2019s eyes thoroughly scanned the area around City Hall. He recorded everything.He recorded what was here and what was not.He used the records as the foundation to figure it out.\u201cSpiders.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cThe spiders are heading toward City Hall.\u201dChoi Jung Soo\u2019s jaws dropped.\u201c\u2026What is about to happen here? D, didn\u2019t they say that there were no monsters in this direction?\u201dKim Rok Soo felt as if he might know what was going on, but he did not respond as he was not certain.Instead, he lowered the backpack he was carrying.Boom.The backpack was placed on the ground with a thud and he opened the zipper.\u201cHo-!\u201dThe anxious Choi Jung Soo looked at Kim Rok Soo in disbelief after seeing what was inside the backpack, but Kim Rok Soo took a few things out before putting the backpack back on his back.\u201cWe are heading to City Hall, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201c\u2026I suppose so, Mr. Rok Soo.\u201dTeam 2 had two new employees just like Team 1.Park Kyung Ho and Choi Soo-In. Of the two, Choi Soo-In seemed to be someone with a healing ability.\u2018I can\u2019t tell whether a monster has appeared or not. But I need to go look.\u2019Choi Jung Soo tightened his grip around his scabbard.\u201cLet\u2019s go Mr. Rok Soo, hurry!\u201dHe immediately started walking toward City Hall.\u201cOne moment please.\u201dChhhh.Choi Jung Soo turned his head after hearing Kim Rok Soo\u2019s voice and a noise.\u201cThe two of us might not be enough.\u201dThe item in Kim Rok Soo\u2019s hand was burning.\u201c\u2026Is that really a signal flare, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201dKim Rok Soo responded calmly before shooting the signal flare into the air.Paaaaat-!A flame shot up into the air and created a ray of light.The light was extremely visible under the grey clouds that were now in the sky.Choi Jung Soo looked toward Kim Rok Soo who spoke as he walked past him.\u201cI\u2019m certain that there must be company employees watching us from a distance, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Watching us?\u201d\u201cWhy would the team leaders who have so much work on their plate show up for orientation?\u201dKim Rok Soo was looking around even as he ran toward City Hall.\u2018I can\u2019t see them with my current abilities.\u2019He could not feel whether there were other presences around them.However, he was certain.\u2018Team leader Lee Soo Hyuk is nearby.\u2019Kim Rok Soo did not put much meaning to the hazing ritual.The reason behind it was simple.Judging just on the item they brought back?Would Team leader Lee Soo Hyuk accept that?The Lee Soo Hyuk that Kim Rok Soo knew was not that kind of person.Then why were the team leaders here?\u2018Safety. And the process.\u2019They came to see the process the newbies use to get things done and to keep them safe.That was the reason Kim Rok Soo had immediately fired the signal flare.\u201cWow.\u201dChoi Jung Soo gasped in admiration while looking at Kim Rok Soo, but Kim Rok Soo did not have time to pay attention to something like that. He had a bad feeling about this.\u201cBut Mr. Rok Soo. You seem to have no hesitation at all?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Jung Soo?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that\u2026 You\u2019re immediately trying to head to City Hall. It might be dangerous.\u201d\u201cThen why are you going, Mr. Jung Soo?\u201dChoi Jung Soo was able to respond to Kim Rok Soo\u2019s question right away.What reason could he have?\u201cI just have to go.\u201dHe was going because he thought that he needed to go.\u201cIt is the same with me, Mr. Jung Soo.\u201dChoi Jung Soo chuckled at Rok Soo\u2019s response before looking at his back and asking another question.\u201cMr. Rok Soo, may I ask how old you are?\u201dThere was no response.He was completely ignored.However, Choi Jung Soo still smiled. Unfortunately, that smile quickly disappeared.Baaaaang\u2014!They heard a loud noise from the east side of City Hall.* * *\u201cWow, shit! What is this?\u201dPark Kyung Ho frowned while opening a crushed drawer.\u201cWhy is there nothing here?\u201dThey had started from the center of City Hall\u2019s main building and moved east. The inside of the building was in better condition than they had expected. Of course, it was not bright since the electricity had gone out, but they were at least able to see enough.If it wasn\u2019t so cloudy and it was a bright day today, they might have been able to search better.Anyway, Park Kyung Ho\u2019s face had been bright when they started their search in this still standing building.\u201cIt\u2019s all empty.\u201dHowever, every drawer was empty as Choi Soo-In mentioned.\u201cHaaa, why is it like this?\u201d\u201cDo you think that someone else already went by?\u201d\u201cWe were the first-, ah!\u201dPark Kyung Ho gasped and then frowned. Choi Soo-In\u2019s face did not look good either. She sighed.We were the first of the new employees to come here, but it is highly likely that other organizations have already been here.\u201cHaaaaaaaaa. I guess it is hopeless.\u201dPark Kyung Ho ruffled through his hair before standing up.\u201cDamn it!\u201dBang!He kicked a drawer before walking over to Choi Soo-In on the other side.\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else.\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s do that.\u201dChoi Soo-In slowly spoke to Park Kyung Ho who was touching his short spear with a disappointed look on his face.\u201cI guess we shouldn\u2019t have been so mean to Mr. Choi Jung Soo and Mr. Kim Rok Soo if it was going to be like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaa.\u201dPark Kyung Ho did not say anything else. He changed the topic instead.I think that other organizations would have already searched all government offices.\u201d\u201cRight? This treasure hunt was apparently harder than we expected.\u201dShe smiled and then added on.\u201cI think Mr. Jung Soo should still be outside searching through the annex. I should tell them about it.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dPark Kyung Ho grumbled before starting to walk toward the door at the center of the first floor.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly get out of here.\u201d\u201cOkay. Huh?\u201dChoi Soo-In lowered her head at that moment.\u201cHmm? Why are there so many spiders-\u201dPark Kyung Ho also looked at where she was looking.\u201cWhat the?\u201dThere were all sorts of large and small spiders in multiple lines moving toward them.No, they were moving past them.\u201cWhy are there spiders all of a sudden-\u201dIt was at that moment.Shhhhhhh\u2014Park Kyung Ho heard an eerie noise behind him.\u201cMiss Choi Soo-In!\u201dHe immediately moved toward Choi Soo-In and hid her behind his back.Crack! Crack!\u201cT, that is-\u201dOn the east side of the first floor\u2026 Something was approaching them from this end that they had yet to visit.Choi Soo-In subconsciously shouted.\u201cW, why is there a monster?!\u201dSomething close to 2 meters tall was coming toward them.They could see red eyes in the darkness.There were eight eyes.Park Kyung Ho realized it as soon as he saw those eight eyes.\u2018This is a spider.And that bastard has seen us as well.\u2019\u201c\u2026Huff.\u201dThe monster spider\u2019s red eyes flashed and it approached them just as he gasped.Crack, crack, craaaaaaaaaack-It was moving very quickly.The monster was large enough to fill the wide hallway.The monster was not flustered.A hunter never becomes flustered because of the prey.\u201cR, run-\u201dPark Kyung Ho could not continue speaking.The monster was already close to them.The spider extended a leg as if it was a spear.Park Kyung Ho hugged Choi Soo-In and rolled on the ground.Baaaaaaaaaang-!The ground broke with a loud noise.\u201cUgh!\u201dPark Kyung Ho, who barely managed to dodge the attack, could see the ground that was destroyed by the spider\u2019s leg stabbing through it. His pupils were shaking.\u201cMr. Kyung Ho, what should we do?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2026\u2026\u201dChoi Soo-In subconsciously asked after seeing the look in Park Kyung Ho\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026Do you not have much real battle experience?\u201d\u201c\u2026That-\u201dPark Kyung Ho had repeatedly trained his ability and his physical body since awakening half a year ago. He only had a few real battle experiences through the Mountains and Streams Guild\u2019s Academy.He was lucky and had many situations where he was protected during the initial stages of the cataclysm that he had not seen monsters very much. Well, he had many instances of running away after seeing monsters in the distance.The monsters he had faced were all monsters that were under control.\u201cI had some real battle experience in the Academy-\u201dPark Kyung Ho had thought that those few times were enough. He had even gone up against a Grade 3 monster.\u201cI, I\u2019ve never seen such a mon-\u2019That was why he knew.\u2018That bastard is a 4, no, a Grade 3 monster.\u2019Monsters became stronger the closer they got to Grade 1.Park Kyung Ho had faced a Grade 3 monster before.However, that was tens of trainees fighting against one Grade 3 monster under the guidance of an instructor. There was no need to feel any pressure or fear for his life as he learned how to safely deal with a monster in a safe situation.He had never faced a monster with just one other person, no, honestly speaking, just himself since he was the only battle team member.\u201cThe Academy is not real experience! That\u2019s training too!\u201dChoi Soo-In shouted in a sharp voice before dragging Park Kyung Ho\u2019s body up.Baaaaaang!The spider\u2019s leg was attacking again.\u201cRun! We can\u2019t deal with it!\u201dShe peeked behind her to escape. She then frowned.\u201cFuck!\u201dThe spiders were filling up the whole pathway.Choi Soo-In and Park Kyung Ho would have to get past this wall of spiders if they wanted to run away.That wasn\u2019t all. Spiders were filling the cracked windows as well. They were making the room darker.\u2018Will it be possible?\u2019They could just walk past if they were regular spiders.However, the spiders\u2019 eyes were red.They were all like that monster spider\u2019s eyes. He had a bad feeling about it.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dPark Kyung Ho shouted toward Choi Soo-In.\u201cThe spider wall-\u201d\u201cDo you have any other suggestions?!\u201dThey had no other choice.\u201cI\u2019ll hold them back for now so go first!\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Soo-In could see Park Kyung Ho turn toward the monster spider while holding his short spear.\u201cGo out and send a rescue signal!\u201d\u201cI got it!\u201dChoi Soo-In started moving toward a window that was not completely covered by spiders yet.She was a healing-type supporter and didn\u2019t have any practical buffs. That was why the first thing she needed to do was to secure a path out.Baaaaaang!However, it was not easy.The monster spider moved quickly.Its target was Choi Soo-In.\u201cNo!\u201dPark Kyung Ho charged at the spider with his short spear.Crack, crack.Currents slowly started flowing out of his spear.Tap. Park Kyung Ho kicked off the ground before sending the short spear flying toward the spider\u2019s leg.Baaaaang!However, the spider\u2019s leg was firm.\u201cS, shit!\u201dThe current-filled short spear was easily parried away.The currents didn\u2019t seem to work on this spider.\u201cMiss Soo-In!\u201dThe monster spider was already in front of Choi Soo-In.Shhhhhh\u2014The mouth underneath the monster spider\u2019s eyes opened. It looked as if it would swallow Choi Soo-In.\u201cFuck!\u201dPark Kyung Ho quickly stood up and charged toward the spider. He seemed ready to body slam it if his spear wouldn\u2019t work.Crack.He heard a different noise at that moment.Screech.The monster turned its head.The large spider\u2019s red eyes were all looking in the same direction.It was a different window covered in spiders.About half of the glass in the window was broken and the frame was crushed.Craaaaaack-!That window was destroyed.Spiders blasted off of it.\u2018Fog?\u2019Choi Soo-In\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u2018No.\u2019This was not fog.White smoke squeezed through the window.Bang!The window was destroyed completely and someone jumped in.\u201cMr. C, Choi Jung Soo!\u201dThe person who jumped in was Choi Jung Soo with his sword in his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its attack had less hesitation and was moving faster.\u201cNo!\u201dPark Kyung Ho was shocked at Choi Jung Soo\u2019s appearance but moved toward Choi Soo-In again.Park Kyung Ho could see someone else climbing through the window at that moment.\u2018Huh?\u2019That person then charged toward the spider.Baaaaang!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cM, Mr. Rok Soo!\u201dChoi Soo-In gasped before looking at the back of the person in front of her. Rok Soo was groaning.Choi Soo-In could see the large iron board in Rok Soo\u2019s hand. It was a bit lacking to be called a shield, but it was enough to temporarily block the monster spider\u2019s attack.\u201cAre you okay?! No, Mr. Rok Soo\u2026 How did you come-\u201d\u201cMiss Choi Soo-In.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you a healing-type supporter?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes!\u201d\u201cThen please support right away.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Soo-In was still unable to think straight and asked instinctively, while Park Kyung Ho was just blankly staring at Kim Rok Soo. However, there was a voice that called out to him.\u201cMr. Kyung Ho!\u201dIt was Choi Jung Soo. Park Kyung turned his gaze. He could see Choi Jung Soo, who was charging toward the spider with a sword in his hand.Choi Jung Soo wasn\u2019t moving as hastily as he had done earlier, but rather was looking extremely calm and skilled.Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo both looked younger than Park Kyung Ho, but the expressions on their faces made it seem as if they were used to such situations.Choi Jung Soo shouted toward Park Kyung Ho. He remembered the core component of what Kim Rok Soo had told him outside the window that was being covered by spiders.\u201cThe body!\u201dPark Kyung Ho then heard Kim Rok Soo\u2019s calm voice.\u201cThat monster\u2019s name is the \u2018Red Eye Spider,\u2019 and its weakness is the lower part of its body.\u201d\u201cY, you know about this monster?\u201dChoi Soo-In asked and Kim Rok Soo calmly responded.\u201cThis monster usually appears in South America. It might actually be the first time this monster has appeared in Korea.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Soo-In wondered how Kim Rok Soo would know about something like that, but his firm gaze made her quickly gather her ability to support Choi Jung Soo and Park Kyung Ho.She needed to immediately use her ability if someone got seriously injured.\u201cMr. Rok Soo, won\u2019t it cast a web if it is a spider?\u201dKim Rok Soo kept his eye on the monster as he responded to Choi Soo-In\u2019s question.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it is fully grown yet, Miss Soo-In. An adult would be close to 5 meters tall and its rank would be divided between Grade 2 and Grade 3 based on the limits of its abilities.\u201dChoi Soo-In\u2019s eyes opened wide after hearing about its rank.She felt fear.\u2018No wonder the pressure was no joke! But why are the two of them so calm? Mr. Park Kyung Ho and I are still so scared.\u2019Choi Soo-In hid her shaking hand.\u201cFurthermore, this Red Eye Spider can only cast a web once it becomes an adult. It can only control spiders or use its legs to attack until then.\u201d\u201cBut why would a South American monster be here-\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but\u2026 I presume that the egg must have been here. This monster\u2019s egg is said to be small. That must be why the first search squad did not find it. It is probably also the reason they determined that there were no monsters.\u201dBaaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!Kim Rok Soo closed his mouth after hearing loud explosions.He then looked forward.He could just barely see enough thanks to the light coming in from the broken window.\u2018He\u2019s doing well.\u2019Kim Rok Soo\u2019s eyes clouded over while looking at Choi Jung Soo.\u201cUgh!\u201dChoi Jung Soo must have been struggling against the monster as he was groaning, but he was still dealing with the spider\u2019s attacks quite well.\u2018Mr. Rok Soo. Please look for an opening and give me a sign. Then I will attack at full force. Please take everybody and run at that point.\u2019The corners of Kim Rok Soo\u2019s lips slowly curled up.\u201cI\u2019m certain now.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Soo-In blankly asked back, but Kim Rok Soo did not hear and just mumbled to himself.\u201cThat spider is a beginner.\u201dIt didn\u2019t know anything about how to fight, which attacks to launch, nor even what powers it had.\u2018It\u2019s like Park Kyung Ho.\u2019The current roaming around Park Kyung Ho\u2019s short spear\u2026Kim Rok Soo\u2019s calculations were now complete.\u201cNow!\u201dChoi Jung Soo heard Kim Rok Soo\u2019s shout. He immediately changed the direction of his sword.Shaaaaaaa-A white aura started to gather around his body.It wasn\u2019t complete yet, but this power was something that held his, and his family\u2019s, everything.It wasn\u2019t even an imugi yet, but the aura that would one day become a white yong slowly appeared.Choi Jung Soo picked up the sword with the white aura infused in it. He then took a step.\u2018Attack it.\u2019Attack that monster.Hold it back.\u2018Make time for them to run!\u2019That was the goal of this battle.\u2018Huh?\u2019Choi Jung Soo\u2019s eyes opened wide at that moment.He could see someone charging toward the monster.Kim Rok Soo.He was running toward the monster while holding the iron board in his hands. He then smashed it into the monster\u2019s face with everything he had.Choi Jung Soo saw Kim Rok Soo\u2019s eyes at that moment. Kim Rok Soo shouted.\u201cBoth of you, attack!\u201dThe direction of the sword changed.Choi Jung Soo shouted toward Park Kyung Ho.\u201cThrow your spear!\u201dOnce Park Kyung Ho saw the charging Kim Rok Soo and the white aura-infused sword wielding Choi Jung Soo\u2026 The moment the two of their voices and gazes stabbed into his mind\u2026 He realized what he had to do.Crack, crackle-!As much current as he could gather was forced into the small spear.The moment Kim Rok Soo smashed the spider\u2019s face with the iron board\u2026Choi Jung Soo parried the spider\u2019s legs that were trying to attack Kim Rok Soo and let them flow by as if they were streams of water.Screeeeeeeeeech-!It made the monster\u2019s two front legs and its body slightly lift up.Choi Jung Soo\u2019s sword started to move again.The white aura followed the sword and created a long diagonal line.From the bottom to the top\u2026The path of the sword that rose up slashed the spider\u2019s body.Slash.Unlike the sturdy legs that even the currents couldn\u2019t damage, the body was weak.A gap appeared on that body.\u201cPark Kyung Ho!\u201dPark Kyung Ho was already running with the short spear in his hand when Kim Rok Soo shouted.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dHe screamed before throwing the short spear.Crackle, crack!The current-infused short spear flew toward the spider.SCREEEEEEEEECH\u2014!The spider screeched and did whatever it could to move its legs.Tang!\u201cN, nooooo!\u201dThe short spear was struck by the spider\u2019s leg and changed directions.Choi Soo-In shouted, almost in a scream. However, her eyes soon opened wide.Tang-!Choi Jung Soo\u2019s sword was not finished yet.The sword slightly touched the short spear that was about to change trajectory. The white aura gently wrapped around the short spear and changed its direction.It was directed back to its original target.The white aura and the current-infused short spear reached their original target.Puuk!The short spear was stabbed into the spot that Choi Jung Soo\u2019s sword had slashed.Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaackle\u2014!\u201cRoooooooooooooooar\u2014!\u201dThe current pulsed through the monster spider\u2019s body and the monster screamed.\u201cW, we got it.\u201d\u2018We took down the monster\u2026\u2026!\u2019That subconscious thought made Park Kyung Ho turn his head to look for Kim Rok Soo.\u201cWe need to quickly run away.\u201dKim Rok Soo was helping Choi Soo-In up and trying to run.\u201cWhy do we need to run when we took down the monster-\u201d\u201cHow can you be sure that there was only one egg?\u201dPark Kyung Ho flinched at Kim Rok Soo\u2019s retort. He got chills on his back. If there was another, no, if there were a lot more monsters?His mind was becoming chaotic.\u201cMm!\u201dChoi Jung Soo groaned and pulled out his sword at that moment. Park Kyung Ho was shocked and turned his body in the same direction.Shhhhhhh-The spiders were scattering after losing their master, revealing the hallway.Two people appeared through the opening.Park Kyung Ho subconsciously started talking in shock.\u201cT, team leader Lee Soo Hyuk-nim-\u201d\u201cAigoo, I guess my team member sees Team leader Lee before he sees his own team leader?\u201dPark Kyung Ho flinched after noticing Team 2 leader while Team 2 leader checked on the condition of her team members before nodding her head.\u201cYou somehow managed to survive.\u201dShe pointed to the door down the hallway behind her back.\u201cWe will take care of the rest, so go back to the auditorium.\u201dChoi Soo-In and Park Kyung Ho slowly and awkwardly started walking in the direction Team 2 leader pointed toward. Their footsteps slowly quickened before they stopped and turned around. The two of their gazes stopped on Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo.Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo started heading toward the door after receiving their gazes.\u201cHe,y Jung Soo.\u201dThe two of them turned their heads.\u201cRok Soo.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk put on his unique relaxed smile while looking at the two of them.\u201cYou both grew up so well.\u201dChoi Jung Soo put on a mischievous smirk while Kim Rok Soo scoffed and made a comment.\u201cWe would have caught it faster if you helped us out in the end.\u201dHis comment made Team 2 leader flinch while Lee Soo Hyuk walked up to the two of them.\u201cOnce you get there, wait for me.\u201dPat. Pat.He patted the two of them on the shoulder before walking past them.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you some food.\u201dHe said that single sentence before walking toward the east side of the building where the monster spider had appeared.He was holding his sword that could slash through anything at any time in one hand.\u201cThen me too.\u201dTeam 2 leader smiled awkwardly and was about to follow behind Lee Soo Hyuk when she stopped and addressed the two of them.\u201cSorry. I told him that we should watch for a little longer. But we would have intervened if any of you were in danger. Plus, Team leader Lee is someone who would let himself get hurt before he lets any of his team members get hurt.\u201d\u201cI know that, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI know he is like that, ma\u2019am.\u201dKim Rok Soo responded and Choi Jung Soo commented as well.\u201cI know that very well too!\u201dTeam 2 leader looked at the two of them as if they were odd before following behind Lee Soo Hyuk.Kim Rok Soo was being supported by Choi Jung Soo as they walked toward where the new employees of Team 2 were waiting for them.Choi Jung Soo nonchalantly asked a question.\u201cYou know Team leader Lee-nim, Mr. Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cWhat about you, Mr. Jung Soo?\u201d\u201cI guess both of us know him.\u201dChoi Jung Soo supported Kim Rok Soo, who was walking forward despite his shaky legs, and made another comment.\u201cBy the way, Mr. Rok Soo. Don\u2019t you think we can speak informally to each other now?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cOh! Then I\u2019m going to speak informally now! Hahahaha!\u201dChoi Soo-In was watching the two of them before poking Park Kyung Ho in the side to ask him a question.\u201cI heard that only warriors gather in Team 1. Doesn\u2019t that seem true?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot the Elite, but warriors.\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaa.\u201dPark Kyung Ho bowed toward the approaching Choi Jung Soo and Kim Rok Soo instead of responding.\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you very much. We really only survived thanks to the two of you.\u201dIt was a sign of gratitude.\u201cWell, it was nothing.\u201dChoi Jung Soo flailed his hand as if it was nothing while Kim Rok Soo stared at Park Kyung Ho for a moment before walking past him as he made a comment.\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you survived, Mr. Kyung Ho.\u201dKim Rok Soo could see that Choi Jung Soo was staring at him. He was about to scowl, wondering why Choi Jung Soo was doing this, when Choi Jung Soo looked away and quietly made a comment.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s fine as long as they survived.\u201dKim Rok Soo stopped scowling and he silently walked next to Choi Jung Soo while being supported.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dChoi Jung Soo commented and Kim Rok Soo responded.\u201cTell the team leader to buy you something expensive.\u201d\u201cShould I?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will!\u201dThe two of their footsteps were neither heavy nor light as they headed toward the auditorium.It was simply the same as usual.Surviving in this destroyed world and surviving these monsters was something they had already been doing for a long time.* * *Slash.Although it was hard to tell whether this had happened naturally or if someone had put them here purposefully, this area was full of numerous insect-type monster eggs. Lee Soo Hyuk was slashing through the things in here.Team 2 leader, who was burning up everything while standing next to him, commented in her usual tone.\u201cTeam leader Lee-nim, the newbies in Team 1 seem to be quite talented. I think that they will survive a long time.\u201d\u2018Survive a long time.\u2019These words were the greatest words of blessing and praise of talent in this company.\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dLee Soo Hyuk had a bitter smile on his face.Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo\u2026Team 2 leader was probably praising them after seeing their calmness and boldness.However, Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s viewpoint was different.Although they were calm during the battle, the fact that they were punks who charged in to save people immediately after seeing the situation had not changed.\u201c\u2026They need to survive a long time.\u201dHe would make it that way.Lee Soo Hyuk firmed his resolve.He hoped that it would be that way.He truly hoped for it.\u2013 Side Story 1. New Employee Kim Rok Soo, End \u2013\u2013 The next side story is, \u2018Our team leader-nim became trash!\u2019 \u2013Author\u2019s NotesHello, it is Yu Ryeo Han.I hope that you have a warm day on the last day of 2021.I also hope that the incoming 2022 will be full of great things.Thank you very much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Posted on\u00a0May 23, 2022\u00a0by\u00a0admin\u00a0\u2014\u00a018 Comments \u2193This place that is simply called the \u2018company\u2019\u2026Team 1, which is said to be the most militant even in this place\u2026Jang Sejong, the new employee and therefore the newest to this team, was walking past the employee break room with a lot of files in his hands.He could hear some whispers through the slightly opened break room door.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that team leader Kim Rok Soo has become a bit weird?\u201dFlinch. He stopped walking.Although the voice was so quiet that regular ability users would not be able to hear, this newbie, Jang Sejong, could hear it because he had a sensory-related ability.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t you think that is the case? It looks like he might be burnt out, but\u2026 it also looks like\u2026 he might have gone crazy\u2026 Drinking at work-\u201d\u201c\u2026You talk like this is the first time that bastard Kim Rok Soo has been weird. He\u2019s always been a crazy bastard.\u201dThe brusque voice was Park Kyung Ho\u2019s voice.He had joined the company at the same time as team leader Kim Rok Soo and was the Team 2 leader right now. However, he was said to be promoted soon.\u201cNo, he is a crazy bastard, but\u2026 He\u2019s never been a crazy bastard in this way. Something, something seems weird.\u201d\u201cI thought you were busy? Stop being nosy and focus on your own work.\u201dScreeeech. Park Kyung Ho stopped talking and the break room door opened immediately.Jang Sejong flinched after making eye contact with Park Kyung Ho. Team 2 leader Park Kyung Ho, who was called the Spearman of Thunder, scowled after looking at Jang Sejong.Flick.However, he simply motioned with his head for Jang Sejong to move along and Jang Sejong bowed while curled up in fear and quickly walked past the break room to his office.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dJang Sejong let out a light sigh.He could not brush aside what he had heard in the break room.\u201c\u2026Somewhat-\u201dAs the person talking to Park Kyung Ho had said\u2026Team leader Kim Rok Soo\u2026\u201cHe really has somewhat become weird.\u201dJang Sejong thought about Kim Rok Soo\u2019s odd changes that the whole company was talking about and then recalled the moment two weeks ago when it had started.* * *Two weeks ago was the first time that Kim Rok Soo missed work at the company without notice.\u201cWhat? Team leader-nim is not here yet?\u201dAssistant Leader Kim Min Ah, who had been dispatched in the morning, frowned while looking at Jang Sejong. Jang Sejong looked a bit scared as he nodded his head.\u201cYes, yes ma\u2019am. The team leader-nim has not come yet.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t his time off until yesterday?\u201dA Support Agent, Jung So Hoon, chimed in as well.\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. It was until yesterday and he should have been back at work today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Something is weird.\u201dAgent Jung So Hoon immediately picked up his coat.Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah quickly scribbled something and handed it to Jang Sejong.\u201cHand this to Agent Cha. I\u2019m going to go see the team leader-nim.\u201dJung So Hoon and Kim Min Ah\u2026 The looks on their faces were quite serious.Jang Sejong could clearly hear their extremely quiet whisper as they left the office.\u201cDo you think the team leader-nim fainted after pushing himself too much these days?\u201d\u201cAgent Jung, have you ever seen the team leader-nim faint? He\u2019s the type of person who would call first even if he was going to faint. This\u2026 Something must have happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you think one of the illegal guilds attacked the team leader-nim\u2019s house?\u201dAgent Jung So Hoon\u2019s voice was slightly shaking from anxiety.\u201cOr maybe an assassin dispatched from overseas abducted the team leader-nim. Ah, I have a bad feeling about this. Doesn\u2019t the team leader-nim live in the outskirts of the city? I\u2019m sure the security there isn\u2019t good either. Should I contact the Team 2 leader?\u201d\u201cCalm down. We will decide after going to the team leader-nim\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cHaaaaaaaaa. Okay. But why does someone like the team leader-nim who makes a ton of money living in the outskirts of the city?\u201d\u201cWho knows? He said he needs a lot of money to become a farmer later.\u201dJang Sejong looked around after watching two of his company seniors leaving.There was nobody in the office.Jang Sejong was the only newcomer this year.\u201cMm.\u201dHe looked at team leader Kim Rok Soo\u2019s seat with an anxious look on his face. There weren\u2019t even many office supplies in that empty spot.Kim Rok Soo.Jang Sejong had not really known that name prior to coming here. In fact, Team 2 leader Park Kyung Ho was the famous one while the name, Kim Rok Soo, was unfamiliar.However, gathering information about the company after deciding to come here, he was able to learn that Kim Rok Soo was quite famous not just in the company, but also throughout the industry and with the government and guilds.Although he had not known the name because this person doesn\u2019t show himself in the media, he was the leader of Team 1, the greatest force in the company, as well as implicitly the leader of the company\u2019s battle agents in the \u2018Body.\u2019Furthermore, even the people in charge of the \u2018Head\u2019 were said to be unable to hold in their admiration at Kim Rok Soo\u2019s abilities.One of the nicknames they had for Kim Rok Soo was cold-blooded.Jang Sejong had thought that this was a negative nickname for him.However, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp after learning the reason for this nickname.Team 1\u2019s mortality rate was 0% since Kim Rok Soo became team leader.They had also not failed any of the missions they were assigned.Kim Rok Soo was said to come up with a thorough plan and complete the mission under any and all circumstances, even if he was lacking the resources to do so.Furthermore, many people\u2019s abilities developed even further when they were in his team.That was why he was said to have received this evaluation.\u2018Kim Rok Soo truly is the person to follow after Lee Soo Hyuk.\u2019That was what they were saying.Jang Sejong could feel Kim Rok Soo\u2019s amazingness after hearing the name, Lee Soo Hyuk.Lee Soo Hyuk.That was a name that was brought up every time the history of Korea after the cataclysm was mentioned. Furthermore, that person was the foundation of this company and the source of its creation.Of course, he has passed away now.Team leader Kim Rok Soo was said to be the person who survived the battle where Lee Soo Hyuk passed away.\u201cMm.\u201dJang Sejong recalled that moment when he heard that Kim Rok Soo truly is the person to follow after Lee Soo Hyuk. Team 2 leader Park Kyung Ho had said something when he heard that.He had been mumbling as if he was discontent about something. Jang Sejong had been the only one to hear it.\u2018\u2026There were two people who were supposed to follow after Lee Soo Hyuk.\u2019Jang Sejong wondered if Park Kyung Ho was talking about himself, but it did not sound that way. It sounded more like there was someone else in addition to Kim Rok Soo.\u201c\u2026Anyway, I hope it is nothing serious.\u201dJang Sejong tried to suppress the worry in his heart.When he was assigned to the cold-blooded Kim Rok Soo\u2019s Team 1\u2026 Jang Sejong had been quite nervous. However, Kim Rok Soo had been a bit different from what he had expected when he met him in person.\u2018Nice to meet you, Mr. Jang Sejong.\u2019\u201cHello, Team leader-nim! Please speak informally.\u2019\u2018Okay then.\u2019Kim Rok Soo had called him by name and greeted him as soon as he saw him, even though Jang Sejong had not introduced himself.He had a cold look on his face and had a mysterious aura about him. He gave off the aura of a leader who had gone through many life-or-death situations and successfully completed missions?A somewhat relaxed yet sharp aura was surrounding him.\u2018Let\u2019s survive here a long time, make a lot of money, and retire.\u2019However, there was at least a little bit of warmth in the words he nonchalantly said to this new employee.\u2018What about food? You must make sure to eat.\u2019\u2018Go home. Newbies can slowly learn.\u2019\u2018You\u2019re living on your own? What about your meals? You just eat whatever?\u2019In his cold and nonchalant face with his stoic voice\u2026 Kim Rok Soo looked after Jang Sejong, completely unlike his cold-blooded nickname.Jang Sejong was still in his probationary period and could not be a part of the strategy meetings or go out to mission, making him not work with the team leader yet, however\u2026Kim Rok Soo had said the following to Jang Sejong after stopping by the office a few days ago, completely covered in blood after a mission.\u2018There\u2019s a side dish shop not too far from here. I paid for a few side dishes there. Make sure to take them when you go home.\u2019\u2018You need to eat properly. I heard you were a support but wanted to be in the field? Fitness is a basic requirement for that.\u2019Kim Rok Soo seemed like a good leader.That must be why all of Team 1 follows Kim Rok Soo.Jang Sejong prayed that there weren\u2019t any issues with the team leader.\u201c\u2026Assistant Leader-nim?\u201dHowever, Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah\u2019s face looked quite weird after returning from going to see Kim Rok Soo.She had a serious look on her face but also seemed to kind of be blanking out while also having an oddly iffy look.Jang Sejong called out to her again.\u201cAssistant Leader-nim?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, ah. What is it?\u201d\u201cIs the team leader-nim okay?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dKim Min Ah smiled awkwardly.\u201cYes. He\u2019s fine. I think he was just tired from pushing himself too much.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Really.\u201d\u201cThen will he be coming to work tomorrow?\u201dKim Min Ah had an odd look on her face after hearing that question before shaking her head.\u201cNo. I think he will be resting for about a week.\u201dShe then left the office saying that she needed to check how much PTO the team leader-nim had left.Jang Sejong heard about it later, but this was the first time Kim Rok Soo ever used over a week\u2019s worth of PTO at once.Jang Sejong was able to hear the things Kim Min Ah was mumbling extremely quietly as she left the office.\u201c\u2026My goodness, it makes no sense.\u201dShe did not say anything else after that.However, Jang Sejong was certain that although Kim Min Ah was saying the team leader was fine, something more serious than he had expected must have happened to Kim Rok Soo.That had to be the case.One week. Something was different about team leader Kim Rok Soo when he came back after his time off.\u201cTeam leader-nim! Welcome sir!\u201dJang Sejong unexpectedly jumped up and greeted Kim Rok Soo because he was happy to see Kim Rok Soo.At that moment\u2026Smile.Kim Rok Soo smiled at him.Jang Sejong couldn\u2019t help but flinch. He had seen Kim Rok Soo smile coldly a few times, but he had never seen him smile like this before.He had a hard to approach aura just like before, but something seemed different.He was cold and rational before but now, he seemed a bit different.\u2018\u2026He seems elegant?\u2019Jang Sejong\u2019s mind blanked out after having that thought about Kim Rok Soo\u2019s smile.\u2018No.\u2019Rather than elegant-\u2018Class-\u2019It seemed full of class.Kim Rok Soo\u2019s smile seemed extremely noble.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dAlthough it was definitely Kim Rok Soo\u2019s voice and he was greeting him the same way as usual\u2026The tone was a bit different.It was still cynical but somewhat elegant.\u2018What the hell?\u2019Jang Sejong pupils were shaking. He looked around.Team leader Kim Rok Soo who had returned to work after a week off\u2026 The reactions from the team members were the same as Jang Sejong\u2019s if not worse.All of their pupils were shaking.Team leader Kim Rok Soo sat down on his chair.Screeeech.\u201cHo.\u201dSomeone gasped.Kim Rok Soo leaned back on the chair almost as if he was lying down. It was different from how he usually sat up straight because he needed to take care of documents as soon as he got to work.Shhhhh.The way Kim Rok Soo slowly reached his hand out to grab a payment document oddly caught people\u2019s attention.Kim Rok Soo looked around the office at that moment. He frowned.\u201cWhat are you all looking at?\u201dJang Sejong wondered if this expression was right, but the way he slightly frowned seemed a bit trashy unlike Team leader Kim Rok Soo\u2019s usual stoic and cold expression.\u201cAre you not going to work?\u201dHowever, his slightly annoyed tone of voice, the movement of his hands, and his gestures all seemed full of class. This was the only way to describe it.\u2018What the hell?\u2019Jang Sejong subconsciously turned toward the two people who came to work with Kim Rok Soo.Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah and Agent Jung So Hoon.The two of them smiled awkwardly as Jang Sejong and the other team members turned to look at them.That was the beginning.\u201cDelicious.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dJang Sejong blankly watched as Kim Rok Soo sliced a piece of tonkatsu. Everybody else had left for work and only Jang Sejong and team leader Kim Rok Soo were in the office.That was why the two of them ended up eating lunch together.\u201cThis is new.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cMm. I won\u2019t have to worry about it suiting my taste.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dSlice. Slice.Kim Rok Soo looked extremely relaxed and experienced as he sliced through the tonkatsu as if it was steak.The way he wiped his mouth with the napkin was so overflowing with class that it seemed too much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was quite a popular tonkatsu shop in front of the company, which meant that there were a lot of people from other departments as well.\u2018!!!\u2019They were all looking at Kim Rok Soo in shock as well.The cold-blooded Kim Rok Soo had taken a week off. Many people were curious about that.\u201cY, you\u2019re going to drink right now, team leader-nim?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dKim Rok Soo sighed so beautifully that it looked like a scene straight out of a painting and brushed his hair back. He had been brushing his hair back like this since coming to work this morning despite his hair being short and not having anything to brush back.\u201cTsk.\u201dKim Rok Soo clicked his tongue.\u201cI want to drink. But I guess I can\u2019t do that at work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI guess this aspect is uncomfortable.\u201d\u2018\u2026What is uncomfortable?\u2019Jang Sejong wanted to ask but could not do so.Instead, they ran into Team 2 leader, Park Kyung Ho, and Director Ma on their way back to the office.\u201cHooooo. How are you feeling, team leader Kim?\u201dDirector Ma.Although Jang Sejong didn\u2019t know very well as he was a new employee, this person supposedly clashed against team 1 quite often. This person, who was one of the permanent directors, was famous for being more interested in politics than what happened in the company.\u201cWow, Team leader Kim resting for a week. How amazing.\u201dDirector Ma smiled slyly but his gaze showed no signs of goodwill.Director Ma made another comment as Jang Sejong became tense.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even take a break when Team leader Lee passed away. I guess you want to rest while working now?\u201dJang Sejong saw Team 2 leader Park Kyung Ho scowl at that moment. Park Kyung Ho was cautiously peeking at Kim Rok Soo at the same time.Park Kyung Ho knew that talking about Lee Soo Hyuk and his team members was one of the things you should never bring up in front of Kim Rok Soo.This was the first time Jang Sejong ever saw Park Kyung Ho being so cautious around someone. It didn\u2019t seem like the same Park Kyung Ho who was always grumbling to Kim Rok Soo. He immediately opened his mouth.\u201cDirector Ma! What you said just now seems a bit much-\u201d\u201cWhy is it too much? I simply told the truth. Isn\u2019t that right, team leader Kim?\u201dIt was at that moment.\u201cPffft.\u201dThey heard a scoff.Jang Sejong looked to his side.Kim Rok Soo was standing there quite crooked with his arms crossed. He was slowly looking at Director Ma from head to toe.And then\u2026\u201cPffft.\u201dHe laughed.It was a scoff similar to before. Anybody would be able to tell that he was sneering. If not sneering, it would make it seem as if he thought nothing of Director Ma.However, it was only for an instant.\u2018Eek!\u2019Team leader Kim Rok Soo smiled brightly.A smile appearing on his cold face seemed awkward but they couldn\u2019t help but look at this extremely radiant smile.Team leader Kim Rok Soo calmly spoke with the smile on his face.\u201cHaaaa. Makes me want to quit.\u201d\u2018!!!\u2019\u2018!\u2019Jang Sejong and Park Kyung Ho looked at Kim Rok Soo in shock.\u201cW, what?\u201dDirector Ma subconsciously stuttered.Quit?!Kim Rok Soo, the cold-blooded Kim Rok Soo wants to quit?!Kim Rok Soo, the person who had done the most work in this company and had been the most passionate talking about quitting?!This was unbelievable.However, Kim Rok Soo stared at Director Ma with a piercing gaze before mumbling with the smile still on his face.\u201cOr should I flip everything over?\u201dDirector Ma\u2019s shoulders flinched.He wanted to say something about how rude this punk was being to him, but he could not do so because Kim Rok Soo was someone who would flip things over if he wanted to do so.Furthermore, although Kim Rok Soo\u2019s smile was radiant, the elegance was gone and he looked like a neighborhood thug.Of course, this was all just Jang Sejong\u2019s observation.Kim Rok Soo walked up to Director Ma and put a hand on his stiff shoulder.Pat pat. Kim Rok Soo patted his shoulder and gently spoke.\u201cDirector Ma-nim.\u201dTeam 2 leader realized that Kim Rok Soo\u2019s gaze was different from usual.He could feel more years of experience behind those eyes than the original Kim Rok Soo. It was a weird feeling.Kim Rok Soo whispered to Director Ma.\u201cPeacefully. Hmm? Let\u2019s live peacefully.\u201dHe then removed his hand from Director Ma\u2019s shoulder. He pulled out a handkerchief from his inner pocket and wiped his palm.They wondered why he had a handkerchief, but Kim Rok Soo\u2019s next comment made both Director Ma and Park Kyung Ho slightly tense.\u201cDirector Ma-nim. There is nobody here who knows more about my position in this company than me. What are you going to do if I quit? Hmm?\u201dDirector Ma\u2019s mouth closed shut while Park Kyung Ho\u2019s jaw dropped a bit.\u2018For Kim Rok Soo to say such things-\u2019Kim Rok Soo was similar to Lee Soo Hyuk.In this company\u2026There was nobody to lead Team 1 if Kim Rok Soo was to quit right now. Furthermore, there was nobody to be the leader of the Body side either.This was not an issue of promotion. There was nobody who could compare to Kim Rok Soo both in the field and in the office.Director Ma?Kim Rok Soo was worth much more than this old ass snake trying to maintain his position.However, Kim Rok Soo had never stated this fact out loud before. Park Kyung Ho could tell that Kim Rok Soo had changed a bit.It wasn\u2019t his appearance or abilities or things like that, but more so his thoughts and values.\u201cPffft.\u201dKim Rok Soo chuckled and walked past Director Ma.\u201cPlease enjoy your lunch, Director Ma. You as well, Team leader Park.\u201dEverything he did looked relaxed. He seemed quite used to things like this.Quite a lot of people had seen what just happened outside the company. Included in that group were not just company employees, but also numerous people from the guilds and the government.Everybody was looking at Kim Rok Soo with shock but Kim Rok Soo brushed this kind of attention as normal before leisurely walking into the company.His walking looked oddly lazy yet elegant.Jang Sejong could see Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah, who had been on her way back, covering her face with both hands.What was going on right now?\u201cAh, hold on.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cSomeone I know is here so I\u2019m going to chat with them for a bit before going back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course, team leader-nim.\u201dKim Rok Soo headed to a side alley by the company. Jang Sejong saw a person wearing a black hat and a leather jacket standing in the alley before turning away.\u201cNewbie.\u201dIt was because Kim Min Ah pulled Jang Sejong\u2019s arm.\u201cAssistant Leader-nim?\u201d\u201cHaaaa. I guess I have no choice. You should know about it as well.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dKim Min Ah pulled Jang Sejong to their office before confirming that nobody was around and then finally speaking.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an issue with the team leader-nim.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? What do y\u2026?!\u201d\u201cHis memory-\u201dKim Min Ah looked uncertain even though she was the one speaking.\u201cHe said that there are things he doesn\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dJang Sejong subconsciously made a comment.\u201cHe was very good with his work despite this so-called memory loss? It seems more like his personality than his memory-\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dKim Min Ah quickly covered Jang Sejong\u2019s mouth.\u201cAnyway\u2026 That is what the team leader told me. So let\u2019s just go along with it for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, ma\u2019am. I understand.\u201d\u201cNewbie, you know this is information we can\u2019t let anybody else find out, right?\u201dThere is an issue with Team 1 leader\u2019s memories.People finding out about this would lead not just Kim Rok Soo, but Team 1 and even the entire company to danger.A leader\u2019s weakness could bring forth hostility from their enemies.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m telling you because you seem to have many reasons to be with the team leader-nim.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I understand. I will keep my mouth shut.\u201dKim Min Ah smiled while looking at the solemn look on their smart newbie\u2019s face.Twenty years old. Jang Sejong, the youngest applicant, had been close to being cut. However, Kim Rok Soo had looked at his resume and selected him at the last minute.\u2018His abilities are on the sensory and brain side but he wants to be in the vanguard and not be a supporter?\u2019Kim Rok Soo then watched Jang Sejong\u2019s interview and test footage before choosing him for Team 1. He said that this applicant showed a lot of potential.There was a reason that Jang Sejong was going around to a lot of places with the team leader. Of course, Jang Sejong did not seem to know about this at all.\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t make it obvious you know when the team leader-nim comes back. I\u2019ll tell him that you know about it, but you know how it\u2019ll seem if you make it obvious, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u201cOkay, so who did the team leader-nim say he was meeting?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either, Assistant leader-nim. I didn\u2019t see the person\u2019s face.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dKim Min Ah wondered if Kim Min Ah had anybody to meet with like that but chose to stop thinking about it.* * *Kim Rok Soo was in the back alley by the company at that moment. He was meeting someone in a place without much foot traffic.\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201dKim Rok Soo was observing the person with a more relaxed position than he had shown inside the company but an extremely slanted position that showed his years of experience.\u201cYou\u2019re the punk that the god sent, right?\u201dThe man wearing the black hat and black leather jacket slowly nodded his head.\u201cYes. The God of Death sent me.\u201dHis dark brown hair appeared under the black hat. He then asked a question.\u201cYou\u2019re Cale Henituse, right?\u201dTeam leader Kim Rok Soo. No, Cale Henituse started to smile.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Are you the god\u2019s lackey?\u201dHaha-\u201dThe man who laughed out loud after being called a lackey slightly raised his hat.The man with dark brown and black eyes was looking at Cale Henituse with an odd gaze.\u201cA lackey? Yes. I guess it could seem that way. I am working for the God of Death right now after all.\u201dHe approached Cale Henituse, who looked like Kim Rok Soo right now.\u201cAre you not having any issues adjusting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m having quite a lot.\u201dCale Henituse grumbled without being able to hide his annoyance.\u201cFoundational information about friends at work, the work itself, and daily life are all in my head so there\u2019s no issues there, but\u2026\u201dHe then pointed to himself.\u201cEven if I see this Kim Rok Soo guy working through information, I can\u2019t help but be inconsistent because I haven\u2019t received all of his memories.\u201dHe then shrugged his shoulders.\u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to complain much even if I came to this world without any information. That wasn\u2019t the important part of my deal with the God of Death.\u201dOf course, it had been chaotic when Cale Henituse opened his eyes in Kim Rok Soo\u2019s body. However, all of those things were minor issues.Going back to the first time he met Choi Han to change the fate of the world while he entered into the body of someone named Kim Rok Soo in a different world. Those were the conditions of the deal.Furthermore, other conditions included finding out the truth about his mother\u2019s death and saving his territory and his family.Those were the important contents of this deal and it was enough if those conditions were met. Instead, Cale Henituse was waiting for important information. He was certain that the God of Death would give him information.\u201cWhere is she?\u201dHe walked toward the man as he asked.\u201cWhere is my mother?\u201dIn this place\u2026Somewhere in this world\u2026Somewhere in this dangerous world where monsters resided\u2026His mother was alive.Her reincarnation was here.\u201cThere is a child.\u201dThe man in the black hat responded.\u201cThere was an incident a few years ago where quite a lot of people died because of an attack by an unranked monster. A child lost her parents during that time and was left alone. She was sent to an orphanage and is currently growing up there.\u201dThe now Kim Rok Soo Cale Henituse had basic information about Korean life in his mind. The God of Death had provided that information to Cale Henituse out of consideration for opening his eyes in a new world.\u201c\u2026And the location?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dThe man handed Cale Henituse a piece of paper. Cale immediately opened it. His hands were slightly shaking.The address of a certain orphanage was written there. Cale\u2019s eyes were scrunching as he read those words.The man continued to speak.\u201cThe child watched her parents pass away. It caused her quite a lot of shock mentally and she has yet to recover from it. She is suffering from serious trauma.\u201dThe man looked at Cale Henituse as he continued.\u201cSo don\u2019t rush it.\u201dCale looked away from the paper and at the man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her wariness will only increase if you rush it.\u201dCale\u2019s dark brown eyes looked into the man\u2019s black eyes.The man smiled weakly at his gaze and continued speaking.\u201cAlso, her dream seemed to be becoming an ability user. Kim Rok Soo, the guy whose body you are in right now, is someone with quite the abilities.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019re already finished analyzing the condition of that body?\u201d\u201cNo. I know what powers he possesses despite not finishing the analysis.\u201d\u201cI guess Kim Rok Soo\u2019s powers are not something you can figure out at once. That punk has multiple abilities.\u201dThe man was about to say something but closed his mouth for a moment.He then eventually resumed speaking. His voice was even calmer as if the emotions had disappeared.\u201cAnyway, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s abilities should be able to help her a lot since that child wants to become an ability user.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCale nodded his head and asked the man in front of him a question.\u201cBut why are you being so nice to tell me all of these things? You could have just told me where she was and left.\u201dHe asked the silent man a question.\u201cDid you know this Kim Rok Soo person?\u201d\u201c\u2026I.\u201dThe man who looked much younger than Kim Rok Soo, who was currently in his mid-thirties, continued with a calm look on his face.\u201cI am temporarily in charge of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Does that mean that you will be the one to show up if I run into any problems or there are messages to be delivered to me?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dCale nodded his head and nonchalantly asked.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you care about my name?\u201d\u201cYou know my name and the truth about who I am. I should at least know who you are. It\u2019s obvious you know this Kim Rok Soo guy.\u201dCale, who was asking the question while standing crooked, did not hide his wariness while in Kim Rok Soo\u2019s body.\u201cHaaa.\u201d The man let out a short sigh before responding.\u201cChoi Jung Soo. My name is Choi Jung Soo.\u201dHe lowered his hat again.He spoke to his friend who was now in his mid-thirties, no, the random person who was now in his friend\u2019s body.\u201cIt is the name of someone who has already died here.\u201dCale\u2019s pupils shook slightly. Choi Jung Soo pretended not to notice as he continued speaking.\u201cFurthermore, I am the dead friend of Kim Rok Soo, the guy whose body you are in.\u201dThey were both silent for a moment.Cale pointed to his body and asked.\u201c\u2026Is this guy living well?\u201dChoi Jung Soo shook his head.\u201cEven I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dCale groaned before nonchalantly commenting.\u201cI think that I will live well.\u201dHe smiled at Choi Jung Soo, who was looking at him. He clenched the paper in his hand.\u201cI think that I will live very well in this body. I have a hunch that that will be the case.\u201dThe corners of Choi Jung Soo\u2019s lips curled up.\u201cThat\u2019s a response I like.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dCale put the piece of paper in his pocket as he spoke.\u201cAnyway, I think I\u2019m going to make a move right away.\u201d\u201cOkay. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cSee you again next time.\u201dKRS Cale quickly exited the alley. (TL: She keeps writing Cale Henituse in Kim Rok Soo\u2019s appearance. It\u2019s repetitive and annoying so KRS Cale it is).The elegance was gone and he looked a bit excited and anxious.Choi Jung Soo watched him for a moment before quietly mumbling.\u201c\u2026It\u2019ll be better if you don\u2019t see me.\u201dA black shadow started to cover Choi Jung Soo in the alley.Chhhhhhhhh. A half-transparent parchment opened in front of Choi Jung Soo.Choi Jung Soo read what was written on it before disappearing into the shadows.\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do.\u201dShhhh\u2014A breeze brushed past the alley.There was nobody there.* * *Slam!The office door slammed over.\u201cAssistant Leader Kim Min Ah.\u201d\u201cYes, team leader-nim.\u201dKim Min Ah\u2019s eyes opened wide while looking at the anxious Kim Rok Soo walking toward her.Kim Rok Soo gave a single comment to the confused woman.\u201cI\u2019m leaving early today.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dKim Min Ah looked at him in shock but Kim Min Ah grabbed his coat and quickly got ready to leave.\u201cLeaving early all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe company was currently rowdy talking about how Kim Rok Soo mentioned quitting or flipping things over in front of Director Ma. However, the person who said those things didn\u2019t seem to care about that at all.\u201cI already did all of my work for the day. Did you know that?\u201dKim Rok Soo asked Agent Jung So Hoon once they made eye contact and Jung So Hoon evaded his gaze as he responded.\u201cYou did do everything, team leader-nim. But to suddenly leave early like this-\u201d\u201cHaaaa.\u201dKRS Cale let out a short sigh.He wanted to get to where his mother was as quickly as possible.\u201cThe team leader position has so many uncomfortable things. Should I just become the CEO to do as I please?\u201dThis Cale Henituse had lived as a noble and had even battled in the War of the Western continent and gone up against the White Star. Based on what he had observed, the person in this body, Kim Rok Soo, could easily take the CEO position if he wanted to do so.Cale Henituse, no, team leader Kim Rok Soo, headed toward the door as if he had not said anything while all of Team 1 was looking at him in shock.\u201cAh.\u201dHe stopped for a moment and patted the newbie Jang Sejong\u2019s shoulder before walking past him.\u201cI put in an order with the side dish store so make sure to take it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dJang Sejong blankly watched Kim Rok Soo\u2019s sudden action before realizing something after hearing those words.\u2018He\u2019s the same.\u2019Although his actions and tone had changed, the things about him that made Jang Sejong listen to the team leader whom he had only known for two weeks had not changed.He was stoic but cared about the people around him and worried about his team members. That had not changed.\u201cAre you going somewhere, team leader-nim?\u201dJung So Hoon snapped out of him and asked Kim Rok Soo, who stopped moving for a moment.Then an odd smile appeared on his face.Excitement, joy, some concern, and tension were visible in that smile.He spoke in a calm yet slightly shaking voice.\u201cI may end up getting a new family.\u201dKim Rok Soo then walked out of the office.Silence filled the office.\u201c\u2026Ha!\u201dAgent Jung So Hoon looked at the air and laughed.Jang Sejong suddenly felt the mood in the office get brighter.\u201cNow I won\u2019t need to worry about him dying!\u201dHis seniors showed their agreement at Agent Cha\u2019s comments and smiles appeared on their faces.* * *Now back to the present\u2026 Jang Sejong, who was walking with a pile of documents, watched as Team 1\u2019s office door burst open.\u201cThat trash-like bastard!\u201d\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dDirector Ma and General Manager Kim came out of the office angry or sighing.\u201cH, hello sirs.\u201dJang Sejong looked extremely scared as he greeted the two of them but they just walked past while ignoring him. The employees from the secretary\u2019s office greeted him with their eyes as they followed behind the two men.\u2018Mm.\u2019Jang Sejong, who had a pretty good idea as to what might have happened, walked through the open office door.Team leader Kim Rok Soo was seated at a table he presumed a meeting must have been taking place until just now and waving at him.He looked extremely relaxed and free while sitting crooked on the chair.Of course, the hand that was holding the cup of green tea was extremely elegant.\u201cHow about ramen for lunch today?\u201d\u201c\u2026Team leader-nim. Did you argue with them again?\u201d\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything. All I said was that I wanted to quit.\u201dKim Rok Soo shrugged his shoulders as if he had no idea.Cold-blooded Kim Rok Soo was starting to get a new nickname.\u2018I want to quit\u2019 Kim Rok Soo.That was his new nickname.If Director Ma, the guilds, or foreign organizations tried to pull any kind of funny business, he would talk about quitting and put the whole company in uproar.His superiors were saying that he was arrogant and unprincipled, and they were even cursing him out and calling him trash.\u201c\u2026Hmm. What should I buy? Hey newbie, do you know what kind of books kids read these days?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, team leader-nim.\u201dJang Sejong thought that Kim Rok Soo seemed the same as usual.Of course, his posture and the atmosphere around him did change, but\u2026\u201cTeam leader-nim, is it really okay to keep angering Director Ma like this?\u201dKim Rok Soo slowly responded to Agent Cha\u2019s question.\u201cWe should get rid of people who don\u2019t take care of their responsibilities properly.\u201dThe atmosphere around him was sharp as if he had not been lazing around. They could feel the sharpness and years of experience of a person who had been through numerous life or death situations.Of course, these were not based on Kim Rok Soo\u2019s experiences. Cale Henituse, who was currently using this body, had also been through many battles and wars, giving him a sharp aura.The two of their auras were similar.Maybe this was an aura only those who had lost loved ones and continued to fight could have.Kim Rok Soo was different but still their same team leader to the team members who had no way of knowing about that.\u201cHaaaaaaaaa. I want to drink. Should I ditch work?\u201dOther than when he acted like this that is.* * *\u201cMm.\u201dKRS Cale opened his eyes.\u201cHow amazing.\u201dHe looked around.He could see the office where he had been working late until just now.\u2018\u2026When did I fall asleep?\u2019He had fallen asleep without realizing it and had met the \u2018real Kim Rok Soo\u2019 in his dream. That person was the true owner of this body and the person who was in Cale Henituse\u2019s body in another world.It was quite unconventional to meet him.\u201cHmm.\u201dHe turned his head.It was dark outside as it was night time.He could see his reflection on the window.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m Kim Rok Soo now.\u2019He decided not to think of himself as Cale Henituse anymore.He was now Kim Rok Soo.He recalled the words he had said to the other world\u2019s Cale Henituse.\u2018I plan on living the rest of my life in this body. That\u2019s why I plan on throwing away the name of Cale Henituse and living as Kim Rok Soo.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m going to make sure to save this world I\u2019m living in right now. I\u2019ll make it so that the people around me can live in peace.\u2019Ding-!Kim Rok Soo unlocked his phone after hearing it go off.< Uncle, when are you coming tomorrow? >A smile appeared on Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face after checking the text message.Tomorrow was when he was going to the orphanage to see his reincarnated mother, no, his niece. The child who had been full of wariness and fear was now listening to him and calling him uncle.He was planning on going through the procedures to truly become family with this niece in the near future. Even without thinking about the fact that this girl was his reincarnated mother, she was a precious member of his family now.He looked at the text and opened his mouth.\u201cChoi Jung Soo.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dChoi Jung Soo, who was still wearing the black hat and black leather jacket, was standing in a corner of the office looking at Kim Rok Soo.Choi Jung Soo had entered without making any noise but Kim Rok Soo did not find this to be odd. Choi Jung Soo always appeared out of nowhere.\u201cDo you have no thoughts about going to see Cale Henituse?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA relaxed smile appeared on Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face.\u201cYou should live a more peaceful life too.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be saying that while working late.\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201dKim Rok Soo watched as Choi Jung Soo slowly disappeared into the shadow and asked again.\u201cWhen are you planning on going to meet him?\u201d\u201cIn the near future.\u201dA smile slowly appeared on Choi Jung Soo\u2019s face.\u201cI plan on seeing him in the near future.\u201d\u201cThe way you phrased it sounds a bit odd? Are you saying that you are going to go see him but that he might not know that you are there?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201dChoi Jung Soo let out a low laugh before disappearing into the shadow.Kim Rok Soo watched the darkness that remained before picking up his pen again.He needed to quickly finish this late day of work and prepare to go see his niece tomorrow.\u201cBusy, busy.\u201dThe smile on Kim Rok Soo\u2019s face did not disappear despite his grumbling.\u2013 Side Story 2.

The record keeper was especially necessary when he went into meetings.He was one of the record keepers assigned to the Crown Prince Palace to be by Alberu\u2019s side.\u2018And it\u2019s not far off!\u2019Unlike the shocked record keeper, the crown prince had thrown another bomb in front of the chief executives just now.\u2018The military command of the northeast region will go to Cale Henituse of the Count\u2019s House of Henituse. He will be the northeast region Military Commander.\u2019It was not a question about whether it was okay to give Cale Henituse the position of northeast region Military Commander.It was a statement.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe heard a warm voice.The lowest ranking record keeper urgently raised his head. The crown prince, who had stopped walking, was quietly looking at him and smiling.Crown Prince Alberu was quite nice to the people working in the palace.He didn\u2019t work them excessively nor did he want them by his side at all times.Furthermore, he praised them for the smallest of things and rarely punished them. He even gave a lot of presents to the people in his palace.The crown prince quietly commented with a radiant smile on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s bad if your mind is in chaos.\u201dThe crown prince, at some point, had started bringing him, the lowest ranking record keeper, whenever he needed something recorded.The record keeper heard his gentle voice.\u201cOpen your ears, move your hands, and keep your mouth shut. You know what to do, right?\u201dThe record keeper tilted his head.\u201cWhat are you saying, your highness? I\u2019m not sure what you are talking about.\u201d\u201cYes. This is why I try having you by my side.\u201dThe record keeper slightly lowered his head without saying anything else.The crown prince did not look at the record keeper any longer and started walking again.However, he soon stopped walking.\u2018Mm!\u2019The record keeper slightly frowned after noticing the reason.\u2018I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019They had arrived at the front of the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.Someone who was part of Crown Prince Alberu\u2019s faction was waiting for him.\u2018Ah, you can\u2019t mess with him today!\u2019Unlike the anxious record keeper, the crown prince started leisurely walking again.\u201cGeneral Wetton. What brings you here?\u201d\u201cYour highness.\u201dGeneral Wetton. The man who was wearing spotless formal attire bowed toward the crown prince.Everything he did was completely respectful and by the book.\u201cI have something I must tell you, your highness.\u201dHowever, he seemed to almost be glaring at the crown prince when he raised his head.\u2018How funny.\u2019The crown prince held back a laugh and nodded his head with a gentle look on his face.\u201cI see. Let\u2019s go to my office.\u201dAlberu leisurely headed toward his office. General Wetton leisurely followed behind him.\u2018This guy is so good at putting on a mask.\u2019However, Alberu knew that General Wetton was feeling quite anxious right now.\u201cYour highness.\u201dHe raised his hand toward the attendant who was walking toward him instead of waiting in front of his office.\u201cI will be chatting with General Wetton so don\u2019t let anybody in.\u201d\u201cI understand, your highness.\u201dAlberu slightly nodded his head at the disguised Dark Elf attendant and entered his office.General Wetton quietly followed behind him.Click.The door closed.Alberu and General Wetton were the only ones in the room.\u201cYour highness.\u201dGeneral Wetton was the first to speak.Alberu sat down on the couch and looked up at General Wetton.\u201cYes, you may speak.\u201d\u201cI heard something weird from Teus just now, your highness.\u201dTeus.He was basically Alberu\u2019s hands and feet. He was the person in charge of delivering important messages to the nobles and administrators who follow Alberu.\u201cYour highness, Teus stated that you were going to give the military command of the northeast region to young master Cale Henituse and give him the position of the Military Commander of the northeast region.\u201dGeneral Wetton could not sit still after hearing that.\u201cIs that the truth, your highness?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dAlberu rubbed his chin with his hand. He looked into General Wetton\u2019s glaring gaze and gently responded.\u201cYes, it is true.\u201d\u201cYour highness!\u201dGeneral Wetton raised his voice before lowering it after seeing how Alberu was looking up at him with a gentle expression.\u201c\u2026It does not make sense, your highness.\u201d\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t?\u201d\u2018All of it!\u2019General Wetton wanted to say that all of it did not make sense.\u2018He wants to give the position of Military Commander of the northeast region of all positions to that young punk?\u2019He could not accept it.\u2018Even though I am from the northeast region? He wants to give that position to Cale Henituse when I am here? To that little punk?\u2019\u201cI know that you treasure young master Cale Henituse quite a bit, your highness.\u201dHe had even included Cale in the envoy to the Empire.However, this was not right.\u201cYoung master Cale is someone with a bright future. He has a big heart and will probably become a light to brighten the future of the kingdom. However.\u201dGeneral Wetton looked right at Alberu as he continued.\u201cHe is still lacking. He is someone who has no experience when it comes to troops. Even if your highness thinks highly of him, that position should be determined by ability.\u201dAlthough he was packaging it nicely, he was basically saying that you can\u2019t give a punk like that such an important position just because you cherish him. He was saying, \u2018don\u2019t let your emotions determine personnel matters.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s okay to say these things to the crown prince.\u2019The Crown Prince Alberu that General Wetton knew was someone who liked people who called him out when he did something wrong.Anybody who participated in meetings with the crown prince would have seen even more straightforward statements causing fierce battles.\u201cI pray that you reconsider your decision, your highness.\u201d\u201cThen General.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dGeneral Wetton could see Alberu smiling.Alberu seemed to have such great smiles for him quite often. That fact put some strength into Wetton\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThen who do you think is appropriate to hold that position instead of Cale Henituse?\u201d\u2018Is he really asking me that question?\u2019Wetton held back the things he really wanted to say and said something else.\u201cYour highness. I am from the northeast region as well.\u201dHe then spoke honestly.The crown prince liked people who were honest about their abilities and appealed to him via merit.\u201cFurthermore, of the Generals from the northeast region, I have the highest rank and have the most experience. In addition, am I not the person you can trust the most, your highness?\u201dAlberu had that gentle smile on his face as he mumbled.\u201cThe person I can trust the most-\u201d\u201cYes, your highness. Would it not be me, who has been by your side since you were young?\u201dAlberu Crossman had grown up lonely without any maternal relatives.When he started to make a move to be the crown prince\u2026 Basically nobody came under his umbrella.Most of them lined up to serve the second prince or third prince.\u201cI have served you. I have remained by your side since the beginning.\u201dThere were many Generals who didn\u2019t care about politics, but also many who were heavily involved. The Generals with interest in politics had been unable to understand General Wetton\u2019s decision back then.However, all of them approved of General Wetton\u2019s decision and were envious of him now.The first prince, who had nothing, had ended up the strongest candidate for the throne.\u201cYour highness, please consider the time I have devoted to you until now.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201dAlberu stood up from his seat. He walked over to the standing General Wetton.\u201cI should put you, who knows the northeast region well, has experience leading soldiers, and has my trust after being by my side for a long time in that position?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness. I will do a good job!\u201dWetton\u2019s voice was energetic.On the other hand, Alberu\u2019s voice was slowly getting quieter.\u201cGeneral Wetton, do you think that you are qualified to say such things?\u201d\u2018Qualified? Of course I\u2019m qualified!\u2019Wetton answered the crown prince\u2019s obvious question without any hesitation. In fact, he was about to get upset at the fact that the crown prince was asking such a question.\u201cYes, your highness! I believe that I am the most qualified.\u201dIt was at that moment.\u201cHahaha-\u201dThe crown prince laughed out loud.\u201cHow entertaining.\u201dHe nodded his head a few times without being able to hide his laughter.\u201cVery entertaining.\u201dGeneral Wetton almost frowned in response. However, he kept a straight face after seeing Alberu open his mouth again.\u201cGeneral Wetton.\u201dHis gentle voice filled the office.\u201cYou were one of the first Generals to support me when I decided to step into politics. No, you were the only General at the time to do so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, your highness. I trusted my discerning eye and-\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAlberu shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dHe spoke with a warm expression still on his face.\u201cDidn\u2019t you come to me after being urged to do so by the third prince\u2019s side?\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201dAlberu stood in front of General Wetton. He was still smiling.\u201cDid you really think that I wouldn\u2019t know anything?\u201dAlberu\u2019s hand headed toward General Wetton\u2019s shoulder.Pat. Pat.Alberu brushed General Wetton\u2019s shoulder as if there was dust on it.\u201cYou seem to think that I wouldn\u2019t know how much dust you were carrying with you.\u201dAlberu\u2019s gaze focused on Wetton.Wetton could see the cold gaze covered by Alberu\u2019s smiling face.\u201cI know it all.\u201dThe quiet voice that was almost a whisper rang like thunder in Wetton\u2019s ear.\u2018He knew about it? All of it?\u2019Wetton got chills on his back.\u2018He knows that I, that I approached him after being urged to do so by the third prince\u2019s side? Since when?\u2019Wetton\u2019s pupils were shaking. He heard a response at that moment that made it seem as if Alberu was reading his mind.\u201cFrom the beginning.\u201dThe crown prince was smiling as if he found this extremely entertaining.\u201cDid you think that I stepped into politics without knowing anything from the beginning? Would the first prince, who had nothing but this fa\u00e7ade, really do that?\u201dGeneral Wetton found the crown prince\u2019s hand that was on his shoulder to be extremely heavy.\u201cIf I have no maternal relatives, then I at least needed information. Hmm? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dThe crown prince was smiling.Wetton was getting cold sweats every time he looked at that smile.Alberu didn\u2019t care and calmly continued to speak.\u201cMore importantly\u2026 Who are you saying doesn\u2019t look at ability?\u201dThe voice that sounded exaggerated sounded mischievous as well.However, what Alberu said next made Wetton flinch.\u201cI would have put you in that position even if you were someone on the third prince\u2019s side if you had the ability to do it well.\u201dA bit of anger appeared on Wetton\u2019s face.\u2018I am not as good as young master Cale Henituse? How long had he been working as a General?! The little punk with that childish moniker of \u2018Young Master Silver Shield\u2019 and he had quite the difference in rank. But I am lacking in abilities? That makes no sense.\u2019He would prefer that the crown prince had said that he was not being considered for such an important position because he was on the third prince\u2019s side.Wetton could not accept the crown prince\u2019s words at all.The crown prince then said the following.\u201cWyvern Knights Brigade.\u201d\u2018Hmm?\u2019General Wetton looked confused.\u201cDo you think that you can take on a Wyvern Knights Brigade?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did he say Wyvern Knights Brigade? That legendary Knights Brigade of the North?\u2019Wetton\u2019s pupils were shaking.\u201cPffft.\u201dAlberu scoffed.\u2018Someone who made it up to General by latching onto the third prince\u2019s side talking about ability. How laughable.\u2019General Wetton stuttered as he spoke.\u201cUmm, were they not coming by s, ships?\u201d\u201cWetton. The truth is harsher than you imagine.\u201d\u2018Funny bastard.\u2019Alberu sneered internally. However, the smile disappeared from his face.\u201cI like people who are honest. Yes, I tend to cherish those who are being true about what they want.\u201dAlberu headed toward the window.The sky was cloudy now.No light was coming into the room. Alberu looked out the window as he asked.\u201cWetton, are you truly focused on this war?\u201dThe crown prince was smiling brightly unlike the cloudy sky.\u201cIsn\u2019t your true focus the Commander position and not the war?\u201dThe inside of Wetton\u2019s mouth was going dry.The crown prince with the radiant smile whom people had a positive image of looked completely different from his usual self.It felt as if a cold blade was right in front of Wetton\u2019s neck.The crown prince\u2019s gaze was as sharp as blades as he spoke.\u201cCale Henituse has put his everything on the line.\u201dAlthough Cale Henituse was extremely impudent and treated the crown prince as if he was a neighborhood friend\u2026 It allowed Alberu to know something.Cale Henituse was putting everything he had gathered on the line for this war. He could feel it even without Cale talking about it.Cale Henituse was going to fight to protect his home, his life, and his family.Alberu was also fighting to protect the Roan Kingdom.People who were focused on the same thing\u2026 There would be no arguments when you work with people who want the same thing.\u201cYoung master Cale has shown his abilities and has shown that he is focused on saving this land more than anybody else.\u201dCale Henituse had not shown these things to Alberu because he wanted to do so.Alberu could simply tell based on everything Cale had done until now.\u201cFurthermore, whether it is power or fame\u2026 He doesn\u2019t care nor want any of those things. He simply wants peace.\u201dThat was why he was a funny bastard, but one he could trust.\u201cI am simply raising the hand of someone who is focused on the right thing and has the ability to do so.\u201dAlberu looked at Wetton, who had shown his greed as soon as he heard the information from Teus, and thought about the person behind this guy.\u201cThe Roan Kingdom is currently standing in a fork of destruction or survival.\u201dHe then clenched his eyes shut.The Wyvern Knights Brigade. Now that the enemies could do aerial warfare, they were capable of stealthier, quicker, and more destructive attacks than by ship.\u201cGo inform the third prince\u2019s side.\u201dWetton felt as if his heart would sink.He didn\u2019t dare to open his eyes.\u201cThere is no king if the kingdom disappears.\u201dAlberu walked over to his office desk and sat down.He then smiled brightly.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you hurry?\u201dWetton opened his eyes and flinched before heading toward the office door. There was no strength in his steps. Wetton\u2019s face was completely pale.\u201cWetton. It would have been great if you had not crossed the line.\u201d\u201cHuuuu.\u201dWetton subconsciously took a deep breath in. Alberu said one more thing to him.\u201cDeliver those words to the third prince\u2019s side as well. It\u2019ll be even better if you tell the second prince\u2019s side too.\u201d\u2018Don\u2019t cross the line.\u2019It was a warning and an order to the people who had supported the third prince and the second prince.Click.Wetton\u2019s hand was shaking as he opened the door.Alberu simply watched Wetton.He knew that something like this would happen at least once.The northwest region\u2019s Marquis\u2019 House of Stan and the southwest region\u2019s Duke\u2019s House of Gyerre had removed themselves from the factions of the princes they had originally supported.Furthermore, the second and third princes seemed to give up their greed for the throne once the crown prince gathered powers such as the Mage Brigade.However, the forces supporting them were unable to throw away their greed.They were very foolish.\u2018This is not the time for that.\u2019Of course, he understood why they were doing it.They wanted something to show for the time, effort, and money they had spent to support their respective princes until now.The throne room was a place full of bastards who would rip you to shreds if you put your guard down even a little.\u201cHe\u2019ll be an example.\u201dWhat happened to General Wetton today would be an example to deliver Alberu\u2019s will to the respective factions.\u201cI guess it was worth working hard.\u201dHonestly speaking, he had purposely made it so that General Wetton would hear about this from Teus.Alberu picked up a document.Shhhh, shhhh.The sound of paper flipping filled the silent office.Plop. Plop.The crown prince stopped moving after hearing a different noise and looked toward the calendar.It was now early February.It was one of the coldest times of the year and gusts of wind as sharp as blades should be blowing, but it was raining instead of snowing.\u201cI guess the rain is starting.\u201dIt always rained for a few days instead of snowing when the anniversary of his mother\u2019s death was near.Amazingly.* * *\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dThe lowest ranking record keeper was here to follow Alberu to his morning meeting.\u201cWhy do you keep looking at me like that?\u201dAlberu smiled brightly at the record keeper who seemed to be warily looking at him.\u201cThe weather is great, your highness.\u201dAlberu flinched for a moment before looking at the record keeper.The record keeper slightly lowered his head as he continued talking.\u201cI heard that the weather will be good for a few days, your highness. It is different from past years.\u201dAlberu\u2019s eyes opened wide.The record keeper curled up before continuing to speak.\u201c\u2026The weather is always left behind as a record, your highness. It is similar to statistics.\u201d\u2018This sharp punk.\u2019This was the reason Alberu thought highly of this timid-looking yet bold-seeming lowest ranking record keeper by his side.\u201cI see. The weather is good today. Pffft.\u201dAlberu chuckled with a slightly stoic face.The rain from yesterday had stopped and the bright sun was shining down on the ground. It should still be cold outside, but it did not seem cold because of the sun.\u2018Phew. That\u2019s a relief.\u2019The record keeper finally sighed in relief.It was because he realized that Alberu\u2019s mood had gotten a bit better.He had heard rumors about the incident with General Wetton yesterday.The attendants and record keepers were always the first to hear the rumors about things that happened in the palace.\u2018They truly are foolish people.\u2019The nobles who followed the second and third princes\u2026He thought that the people who were still trying to maintain their power were foolish.Looking past the war and power\u2026\u2018There is a right time to mess with him, a right time!\u2019It was soon the anniversary of the death of the crown prince\u2019s mother.The crown prince\u2019s birthday was coming up in early spring after that.The imperial family did not do anything for the crown prince\u2019s mother on the anniversary of her death.Even the king seemed to be ignoring the anniversary of her death. He seemed to be doing it on purpose.Crown prince was said to go to where his mother was buried and spend a few hours alone on the anniversary of her death.Furthermore, he took no record keepers nor attendants with him when he went there.As for the crown prince\u2019s birthday, the King\u2019s Palace sent presents and cake, but the day passed by quietly without any celebrations nor events.\u2018According to what I heard, the second and third princes\u2019 sides prepared the nobles.\u2019Neither the second prince nor the third prince messed with Alberu around this time. Although they didn\u2019t like each other, the siblings knew where to draw the line.The problems were the nobles and administrators who couldn\u2019t see anything because they were worried about their shrinking power and future.\u201cHmm. I feel a bit better thanks to you.\u201dThe record keeper was slightly shocked and looked at Alberu.The crown prince, whose expression seemed dry yet relaxed instead of radiant, looked around.Only the crown prince and his true subordinates were in this domain right now.Well, other than this record keeper that is\u2026\u201cShould I tell you one of my secrets?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u2018A secret?\u2019The record keeper\u2019s eyes opened wide at Alberu\u2019s sudden comment.\u201cIt is information a record keeper would like a lot.\u201dThe record keeper clenched the parchments on his side since the crown prince was not one to say things he did not mean.Gulp.He couldn\u2019t help but gulp.Alberu chuckled and quietly whispered because he knew that record keepers were second to none when it came to liking rumors and information.\u201cI plan on looking after the anniversary of my mother\u2019s death and my birthday when I become king.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe record keeper\u2019s shoulders sank.That timid-looking appearance made Alberu chuckle again.The eyes of the record keeper with an extremely small physique were shaking.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAlberu mischievously spoke.\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of immature for the crown prince to do this? You can put it in the unofficial history. I heard that record keepers used unofficial things and secret things to make some money?\u201d\u201cYour highness-\u201dThe record keeper bowed deeply at that moment. He calmly bowed before raising his head and looking straight at Alberu.\u201cI will record it in the records when you become king, your highness.\u201dAn odd smile appeared on Alberu\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026I like what you just said.\u201dIt was at that moment.Knock knock knock-Alberu\u2019s confidant Teus\u2019s voice could be heard after the urgent knocks.\u201cYour highness! It is me!\u201dWiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-Alberu\u2019s video communication device started shining at the same time to let him know that it was an emergency situation.Click.The attendant urgently opened the door after receiving a look from Alberu and the administrator, Teus, shouted as soon as he entered the room.\u201cThe North is about to make their declaration of war, your highness!\u201d\u2018Already?\u2019The record keeper\u2019s heart sank.The war really was starting.The time of peace had continued for so long that war only felt like distant history.An indescribable chaos filled the office.Anxiety and uncertainty started to rise.These emotions were caused by the word, war.They heard a gentle voice at that moment.\u201cThere is no need to be shocked.\u201dCrown prince Alberu Crossman was famous for his radiant smile and an appearance that suited it.Yet he was not smiling.However, his gaze was that of a determined person.He spoke to his subordinates.\u201cJust do as we have prepared.\u201dThe record keeper blankly looked at Alberu, who was surrounded by the sunlight that was coming in through the window.\u201cThe sun will shine down on Roan.\u201dThe record keeper was certain of it at that moment.This moment would definitely be recorded as the starting point of change in history.He was also certain that the history of Roan would continue without stopping.* * *None of them could say anything.The Indomitable Alliance had declared war against the Roan Kingdom and the Roan Kingdom had also made their declaration on the Western continent.\u2018The Roan Kingdom is the kingdom with the longest history in the Western continent.\u2019\u2018We will show them the strength of the survivors.\u2019It would not be weird if the war started at any moment.Nervousness was suppressing the entire meeting room.\u201c\u2026Waiting sure is difficult.\u201dSomeone spoke as they could not handle the silence. He peeked toward the head of the table.Alberu Crossman was silently seated there.The palace located at the center of the royal palace\u2026 That palace was completely emptied.It was filled only with things for wartime.At the center of it was Alberu Crossman, who had received full authority from King Zed Crossman during the Roan Kingdom\u2019s proclamation not too long ago.\u201cYour highness. Will it really be okay not to send any troops to the Henituse territory?\u201dAlberu looked forward after hearing the person in charge of information ask that question.Finance, military, capital defense, border defense, diplomacy, and administration.The best individuals of each category were all gathered in this meeting room.Alberu was looking at the video communication device in front of him.The silver shield surrounding the skies of Western City where the Lord\u2019s Castle was located\u2026\u201cNot yet. The Henituse territory has not requested anything yet.\u201dThe Minister of Finance, the eldest of the people here, started to speak.\u201cThe House of Henituse is probably extremely wealthy. They had been building their wealth for generations.\u201d\u2018Something amazing might happen if the Henituse territory used that money to prepare for war.\u2019\u201cHowever, they did not have enough time to use that wealth to prepare for war.\u201dShe looked concerned as she said that. It was more anxiety than concern.\u201cI\u2019m sure that they have prepared in advance as young master Cale Henituse gave them information about it, but for a territory to handle everything alone-\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dAlberu\u2019s stern voice descended on the meeting room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On, who had brought the fairy tale to him, was looking up at him.On avoided Cale\u2019s gaze and slowly mumbled.Well, she mumbled loud enough so that he could hear everything she said.\u201cI wish Hong would like snow, nya.\u201d\u201cPffft.\u201dCale chuckled. On, in her kitten form, gently hit Cale\u2019s calf a few times.\u201cNoona!\u201dThey heard Hong\u2019s voice outside the room at that moment.On looked at Cale\u2019s face once and started heading toward the door with elegance, as if she was relieved.\u201cI think it would be fun, nya.\u201dShe walked out after leaving that comment.\u201c\u2026What is fun about it?\u201dCale looked at the spot On had left with a baffled and irritated expression on his face but there was nobody to respond to him.Cale leaned into the soft couch back and leisurely mumbled.\u201cWell, I will just think about it when it snows.\u201dHonestly speaking, On was having a similar thought as well.That was why she couldn\u2019t help but flinch after following Hong to find their youngest, Raon.\u201cMary, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRaon was apologizing to Mary.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Raon-nim. I can go alone.\u201d\u201cI promised to go tour the forest with you today but there is something I have to do.\u201d\u201cI understand, Raon-nim. But may I ask what it is you have to do?\u201dMary, as well as On and Hong who were coming toward Raon, looked at him with confusion. Wasn\u2019t it Raon\u2019s hobby to roam through the Forest of Darkness with Mary and pick up interesting things?It was the first time he declined his favorite past-time.\u201cHeh.\u201dRaon let out a short laugh.\u201cI am great and mighty!Raon added one more comment.\u201cYou can look forward to it.\u201dHe then headed toward the basement of the building alone without saying anything else to Mary, On, or Hong.\u201cI\u2019m curious, nya!\u201d\u201cI am curious as well.\u201dHong and Mary looked at Raon\u2019s back with curiosity but could not follow him. It seemed as if Raon didn\u2019t want to tell them about it.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s the laboratory\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly On watched Raon\u2019s fluttering wings with a mysterious gaze as Raon headed toward Rosalyn\u2019s laboratory in the basement.Hong, now in his human form, walked up to Mary and pulled at her sleeve.\u201cYou can go with me, nya-\u201d\u201cThat sounds great.\u201dMary responded without hesitation and looked at On. On shook her head to decline.\u201cNoona, then the two of us are going to go!\u201dHong headed toward the Forest of Darkness with Mary.On, who was left alone, debated for a moment before moving toward where she expected Ron to be.* * *Raon knew that he was very smart and crafty.There was no way he wouldn\u2019t know that.He had almost instantly learned reading and writing when Rosalyn taught it to him and information about what magic was and what he could do came naturally to him once the mana restricting chains disappeared.\u2018The snow that Raon-nim is talking about, mm, that\u2019s a bit difficult.\u2019Rosalyn had smiled awkwardly when Raon explained the first snow he wanted.\u201cIt needs to be cold but warm\u2026 It needs to disappear instantly but be soft\u2026 But it also needs to be firm.\u201dRaon mumbled to himself as he moved the mana around him.\u2018Rosalyn, tell me even if it is difficult! I am a great and mighty Dragon! I will learn everything well and know how to do it!\u2019\u2018Mm.\u2019Raon then saw Rosalyn smiling the same way Choi Han and Ron sometimes smiled at him. On had smiled in a similar fashion while rubbing Raon\u2019s smooth head.Of course, Cale did something else instead of smiling like that.\u2018You truly are a great and mighty four year old Dragon.\u2019Cale would comment like that with a stoic look on his face.Raon couldn\u2019t help but open up his shoulders proudly each time Cale did that.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I am a great and mighty four year old!\u201dRaon snickered and recalled what Rosalyn told him after contemplating for a long time.\u2018Raon-nim, I think that no matter what you make, it will end up the first snow that you want.\u2019She then smiled brightly at him.\u201cAs expected, the smart Rosalyn knows something.Hehe.\u201d Raon laughed before writing something in large letters on a parchment, sticking it in front of the laboratory door, and tightly locking it.< The great and mighty Raon Miru is currently using the lab! >< Don't come in! >He then started experimenting.Swoooooooosh-An extremely gentle breeze filled with mana started to roam around Raon because he knew he shouldn\u2019t destroy Rosalyn\u2019s study location.Raon closed his eyes.It was dark but not dark at all.It was like the stars he saw once he came out of the cave.Snow sparkling like the stars was coming down in the darkness Raon was imagining.Shaaaaaaaaaaaa-Small white pebbles slowly started appearing from within the mana breeze and swirled.Raon opened his eyes. His dark blue eyes were sparkling with anticipation.\u201cHeh!\u201dRaon had an identical smile to Cale\u2019s as he delicately and elaborately controlled his mana.Drops of sweat started to fill Raon\u2019s forehead.\u201c\u2026Soft things are harder!\u201dUnlike large hail, swirling snow storms or whirlwinds\u2026 These extremely small pebbles, the gently falling snow, and the wind that isn\u2019t cold\u2026 It was harder to make things weak.\u201cBut it is easy!\u201dIt was a lot of work but not enough to call it difficult.Raon thought about the size of the first snow that he wanted. Snow that falls over the Forest of Darkness, Harris Village, and the Henituse territory.Gently controlling mana in such a vast range was an issue that, even as a Dragon, the four year old Raon had to consider a lot of things.It was even more complicated because he was not trying to destroy his enemies or an island.He also wanted to do it perfectly.He wanted it exactly as he had seen in the fairy tale. He wanted to perfectly recreate it.\u201cHeh.\u201dRaon continued to chuckle but he did not realize it.The black Dragon was enjoying this moment.\u2018This is nothing!\u2019The time he spent imprisoned in the cave\u2026 He had been unable to do anything himself during that terrible time that he didn\u2019t even want to remember.There were barely any chances to learn, feel, or even think.He had many opportunities to think about how to escape from these people who imprisoned him or how to defeat these terrible bastards, but\u2026 He didn\u2019t know what joy or happiness was to think about that.However, the problem now was that there were too many things for him to think about and look forward to doing.Growl.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dRaon, who had been practicing his delicate control of mana in a large area, opened his eyes wide. Raon pulled back his mana and placed both of his front paws on his chubby belly.\u201cEven my tummy is great and mighty! It is extremely accurate!\u201dRaon looked at the clock.It was snack time.\u201cThe human said that you must always remember to eat!\u201dRaon checked to make sure nothing in Rosalyn\u2019s lab was scattered or messy and quickly headed toward the kitchen.He then tilted his head in confusion.\u201cDelicious food making Beacrox, where is everybody?\u201dTap.Beacrox didn\u2019t say anything and simply placed a basket full of cookies on the table in front of Raon.Beacrox did give them desserts during snack time despite talking about maintaining a healthy diet, but he had never given so many to Raon at once.Raon found this to be odd but quickly hugged the basket with his two short front paws and tilted his head in confusion.\u201cThis is weird!\u201dOn and Hong were not here.A large basket of cookies for On and Hong was placed on the table.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dBeacrox sighed and gave a short response as if he was talking to himself.\u201cHong with Mary. On with my father.\u201d\u201cOh, thanks!\u201dGrowl.A thunder-like noise flowed out of Raon\u2019s stomach again and Beacrox placed a cup of warm sweet honey tea next to Raon\u2019s basket with a cold look on his face.\u201cDo you know what the human is doing right now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll stop making you talk! Go cook!\u201d\u201c\u2026Huuuuuu.\u201dRaon debated whether to go eat with Cale since On and Hong were with Ron and Mary, but shook his head and started to eat the cookies and drink the tea alone.\u2018I\u2019ll eat quickly and go to the basement!\u2019Raon\u2019s wings subconsciously fluttered.Beacrox was staring at him but Raon did not notice.While that was going on, Hong was looking at the sky that was slowly getting cloudier and opened his mouth.\u201cI want to know if Mary noona has ever seen snow, nya!\u201dThe tone of his voice was high but the kitten-form Hong\u2019s ears were slouching down. His eyes were doing the same.Mary looked at Hong and calmly responded.\u201cI have never seen snow.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dMary did not have the memories of her childhood and the Underground City beneath the desert where she lived had rain caused by Elementals but not snow. It was because there was a lot of farming down there.\u201cHowever, I have seen it in books.\u201dShe had read many books about the outside world in addition to necromancer-related texts after becoming a necromancer.Of course, she had read the fairy tale, < The First Snow is Soft! > that Raon showed her as well.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dHong let out a deep sigh.Something seemed to be frustrating him as he pushed down on the ground with his small paws. Mary stopped walking and crouched down next to Hong.Hong peeked at Mary. Hong saw Mary as someone who was easier to be around than the other adults. She was definitely older than him but there were times when she oddly felt like a friend.She was the friend who didn\u2019t speak much but carefully listened to what he had to say.Hong mumbled in a quiet voice that was hard to understand.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t really like snow, nya.\u201d\u201cWhy do you feel that way?\u201d\u201c\u2026I just do.\u201d\u201cCould you tell me more?\u201dHong moved over to Mary and leaned his body against the crouched Mary.\u201cWe struggled so much during winter when I was on the run with my noona, nya. It was much harder whenever it snowed. It was hard to find food and it was so cold when we would go to bed, nya.\u201dThe thing that was the most difficult\u2026Hong closed his eyes.He recalled how they could not stay in any spot for a long time and had to keep moving while hiding away to not get caught even during raging snowstorms.At that time\u2026At that moment\u2026In that world\u2026\u201c\u2026It was just noona and me.\u201dOn and Hong. Only the two of them existed.Of course, there were a lot of people and animals.However, it was hard to see anything through the snow storm and his sister On was the only one by Hong\u2019s side.\u201cI don\u2019t like snow, nya.\u201dHong finally shared his honest feelings.Hong did not like snow very much. If asked whether he liked or hated it, he hated it.However, he found it hard to say that to other people, especially Raon and his sister On.\u201cIt\u2019s fine to hate it.\u201dHong raised his head.He could see a face with black lines all around it underneath the low hide smiling at him.\u201cThere are many things I hate as well. To be honest with you, I don\u2019t like the night. Actually, I used to hate the night.\u201dHong\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u201cT, that\u2019s not true, nya! Something is weird, nya!\u201dMary went to enjoy the night time view of the Forest of Darkness with On, Hong, and Raon whenever she had time. Beacrox even stared at them some nights because the four of them spent so much time outside looking up at the night sky on nights where the stars shone so brightly that it felt as if they would fall down.Mary reached her hand out and petted Hong\u2019s head.\u201cI used to hate night time in the past.\u201dMary did not know that she hated night time at the time. In fact, she only learned that she had hated something once she started to like the night.\u201cHowever, I like it quite a lot now.\u201dMary petted the soft red fur as she continued speaking.\u201cThat was why I thought long and hard about why that was the case.\u201d\u201cAnd, nya?\u201dHong urged Mary to continue as if he was curious. Mary quietly chuckled before speaking in a stiff but warm voice.\u201cThen I learned that the problem was not the night itself.\u201dHong tilted his head from side to side as if that was hard to understand.\u201cThe snow might not be the issue for you either, Hong.\u201d\u2018The snow might not be the issue?\u2019Hong rubbed against Mary as if he found it even more difficult to understand.\u201cAnd you may continue to hate snow.\u201dHowever, he stopped rubbing against Mary after hearing her voice again and looked up at her.\u201cAnd that is okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it really?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think that the young master-nim would say if you said that you don\u2019t like snow, Hong?\u201dHong blinked a few times as he thought about it.It was obvious what Cale would say so Hong knew what to say.\u201cReally? Okay then.\u201dHong felt some strength in his shoulders after saying what he thought Cale would say.Mary stopped petting Hong and responded.She shared her thoughts to Hong, who was like a younger brother or a nephew to her.\u201cHowever, if there is one thing I personally slightly wish for from you would be for you to keep your head awake and keep an open mind even if you like or hate something.\u201d\u201cKeep my head awake and keep an open mind?\u201dHong looked up at Mary with teary eyes as if those words were difficult to understand before nodding his head after seeing Mary\u2019s warm smile. He then shouted energetically.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means but I will at least remember it, nya!\u201d\u201cThat is enough. There is no need to feel tied down by my words.\u201d\u201cMm, but I want to remember it, nya!\u201dHong responded energetically and raised both paws while looking at Mary. Mary opened up her arms and picked Hong up. She then stood up.Hong looked up at the sky. The sky was slowly turning into ash-like color starting from the north. He slightly frowned while looking at the sky but his heart was not anxious.Instead, he wondered what his sister and Raon were doing right now.In another part of the area, Ron was wiping the blade of a dagger the length of his finger as he opened his mouth to speak.\u201cIt looks like you have something to say. Are you just going to keep drinking your tea?\u201dOn the other side of the table at the seat facing Ron\u2026 On, who was seated on the couch was blowing at her tea to cool it as she drank it.It was honey lemon tea that Ron had boiled for her. On had been asking for lemonade and honey lemon tea since some point in the past. Of course, Ron had a pretty good idea as to why she started doing that.\u201cI came to see you because I just wanted some tea.\u201dOn calmly responded and blew at her tea again before taking another sip.She seemed so focused that drinking tea seemed to be the most important thing right now, but\u2026\u201cTsk.\u201dRon quietly clicked his tongue and reached toward the small table next to his chair.Clunk. A drawer opened and Ron pulled a small box out of there. He then placed it on top of the table.Click.On opened the box without saying anything.There were some dry fruits in there. The small red fruit had a nice shine to it despite being dried.It was On\u2019s favorite fruit.This fruit was everywhere in this house, fresh when it was in season and either dried, jammed, or pressed as a drink during other times.On ate the fruit while nonchalantly saying something.\u201cGetting hopes up too much is concerning and hating something too much is also concerning, nya.\u201d\u201cA little kid like you worrying too much is also not good.\u201dOn heard Ron respond immediately without any hesitation.On flinched and looked at Ron. Ron didn\u2019t even look at On as he wiped a fifth dagger so much that it glowed.On looked at him and opened and closed her mouth without saying anything. She did that for a while before finally ending her hesitation to ask a question.\u201c\u2026Do I seem not childish enough?\u201dRon finally looked away from the dagger and looked at On.On was similar to the childhood of someone else Ron knew.Cale Henituse.Cale was like this after his mother passed away, before he became trash. Of course, this grey Cat punk in front of him was more mature and knew more about the ways of the world.Ron looked back at his dagger.On picked up another fruit after seeing his reaction.She then heard Ron\u2019s nonchalant voice.\u201cYou\u2019re better than the trash.\u201dTrash.On knew the person Ron was calling trash.She was certain that he was talking about Cale.Cale was someone Ron cherished as much as Beacrox. Ron saw Cale as his own child. Of course, Ron would never admit to that, but On was sharp enough to know that. How could she not know?And Ron was saying that On was better than Cale.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t think the trash was bad either.\u201dRon then quickly added that he didn\u2019t think that the trash was bad either.\u201cPfft-!\u201dOn quickly closed her mouth to stop her subconscious laughter. Ron\u2019s hand stopped wiping the dagger for a moment before it resumed.Ron did not look at On at all. However, On knew that Ron was like this because he was embarrassed.The grandpa in front of her always got so shy whenever he told the truth. Of course, he was never like this in front of Cale.Ron looked up at On.\u2018Not like a child?\u2019On was drinking her honey tea and eating dry fruits again. She probably doesn\u2019t notice it, but her legs were moving front and back unlike when she was sitting there earlier.\u2018Anybody would think she\u2019s a child so to say that she is not\u2026\u2019\u201cPffft.\u201d Ron laughed extremely quietly so that On would not hear and focused on his dagger.The people at this house knew.They knew that On was a child as well.They knew that she came to look for them whenever she had a concern, felt lonely, or needed someone to lean on.That was the reason that everybody in this house had one or two of the food On liked in their rooms at all times.\u2018May I take this too? I don\u2019t have anything to give On if she comes.\u2019Even Lock, who was now a teenager, had a box of these dried fruits in his room. Lock had come a few days ago and hesitantly asked Ron for a box of this dried fruit.That timid kid seemed to find Ron difficult to talk to but came to look for Ron because it was related to On. Lock became quite brave when it was something related to the Wolf children, On, Hong, or Raon. Of course, Lock himself did not seem to recognize that.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRon bluntly commented to On, who was staring at him.\u201cThe tea and the fruit are delicious.\u201dHe slowly looked away after hearing that.\u2018Looks like I need to get some more.\u2019Ron looked inside the now half empty box and added dried fruit to the list of things he was going to request Deputy Butler Hans to procure.He watched On looking relaxed as she was humming while eating fruit and looked back at his dagger.He did not notice.He did not notice that his movements seemed quite cheerful as he wiped the dagger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Posted on\u00a0July 16, 2022\u00a0by\u00a0admin\u00a0\u2014\u00a04 Comments \u2193\u201cGasp.\u201dLock covered his mouth with both hands.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dChoi Han sighed deeply before speaking.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the vague plan you gave before is exactly what you just told us?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dRosalyn responded refreshingly and Choi Han looked at her for a bit before nodding his head.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLock watched the calm Choi Han and the smiling Rosalyn and quietly lowered his head. He then nodded his head as well after a bit.\u2018I see. Mm\u2026 I guess that\u2019s it if hyung and noona says it is.\u2019Lock decided not to think deeply about it. He looked down at his hands instead.\u2018I need to get stronger.\u2019He thought about someone. He fixed his thoughts while recalling that person\u2019s back.\u2018No. It\u2019s not getting stronger.\u2019That person did not seem strong at all. He did not have some exceptional powers.But looking at that person\u2019s back oddly made his anxiety disappear.\u2018I need to become like that too.\u2019He needed to do that so that somebody, such as his young siblings, could look at his back and have the same thoughts.Lock closed his eyes as he firmed his resolve. Although he didn\u2019t know what was going to happen in the Breck Kingdom, he knew that it would go well because he was with his hyung and noona.Furthermore, it should help him grow stronger as well.* * *The Breck Kingdom had many secret passages for potential emergency situations.One of those secret passages was in an isolated house in a part of the forest that doesn\u2019t get much traffic.The door to the basement of that house opened.\u201c\u2026Noonim.\u201d\u201cJohn, long time no see.\u201dJohn stopped walking out of the basement for a moment to look at Rosalyn.\u2018She really is alive.\u2019John\u2019s heart was finally at peace. He had trusted that she was alive, but it was different from being able to confirm his sister\u2019s health with his own eyes. However, his face did not show that relief.\u2018Who is it?\u2019The kitchen was connected to the basement.There was a four person dining table in the kitchen. Rosalyn was sitting down at the table, pointing to the seat across from her for John.And behind her\u2026\u201cH, hello.\u201dThere was a feeble but quite tall guy. The face that was visible thanks to the magic light on top of the dining table and the voice he heard let John know that this guy was a young boy.\u2018Mm.\u2019However, there was someone who was more eye-catching than that young boy.It was the person who was seated on the kitchen window ledge looking outside. He bowed his head when he and John made eye contact.He then looked outside again.\u2018\u2026Something is odd.\u2019This person seemed a bit older than the other tall young boy, but he also seemed too young to be called a young man. However, the person\u2019s expression that was visible thanks to the moonlight shining into the window was bleak, unlike his oddly innocent-looking face.Was it because John kept looking at him?\u201cMy name is Choi Han.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dThe person introduced himself as Choi Han.\u201cAnd this is Lock. They are both my important friends.\u201d\u201cAh. Hello, Prince John.\u201dRosalyn introduced Lock and Lock awkwardly greeted John with the Breck Kingdom\u2019s style of respectful greeting.John finally smiled and sat across from his sister.\u201cPlease sit down as well, Lock-nim.\u201dLock rapidly waved his hand as John pointed to an empty seat.\u201cAh, I am okay, your highness! And t, there is no need to be so respectful to me.\u201d\u201cThat is not true, Lock-nim. You are my noonim\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you very much.\u201dLock shyly smiled before moving to Choi Han\u2019s side.John watched him with a smile on his face before turning his head to look at Rosalyn. This was his sister, whose red hair was even more splendid than the light from this magic light.\u201cNoonim. Was it the Archduke?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dA twisted smile appeared on Rosalyn\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026The Archduke did something quite daring.\u201dThe House of Richardson, the only Archduke\u2019s household in the Breck Kingdom.That house\u2019s history could be traced back about 200 years. The king at the time had two children. The second child, who had shown special talent, was made king while the first child was given the title of Archduke Richardson.It was said that the first child accepted that situation at the time, however, the situation changed as the generations passed.The current Archduke\u2019s House of Richardson was the leader of the noble faction and was always in political conflict with the king.\u201cNoonim, it seems as if the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs leaked your travel path to the Archduke.\u201d\u201cReally? Royal Father must have been disappointed.\u201dThe head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was one of the king\u2019s close confidants.Rosalyn looked down at the table that was lit by the magic light and opened her mouth.\u201cThe current Archduke must really desire the king\u2019s position. However, it is not a position he could get because I die.\u201d\u201cHe must trust his child and the future.\u201dRosalyn looked at John. John looked at the magic light as he continued to speak.\u201cThe Archduke\u2019s first child is said to be a genius who is only second to you, Noonim, at least when it comes to administration and finance. Because of that-\u201dRosalyn finished the sentence as John could not do so.\u201cBecause of that, if nobody knows that it was the Archduke who was responsible for my death in a foreign kingdom\u2026 Even if the current Archduke cannot become king, his son or maybe his son\u2019s descendants could achieve that dream?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe Archduke must have determined that it would be much more difficult to find an opening to take the throne if Rosalyn became Queen.He must have done this because he believed that if Rosalyn was not there, then there were only average candidates for the throne, making a better future possible.\u201cHowever, the Archduke failed because he wasn\u2019t fully aware of your magic abilities. He\u2019s probably extremely anxious right now.\u201d\u201cThe Archduke is probably uncertain as to whether I am dead or alive.\u201dJohn looked at Rosalyn\u2019s eyes after hearing her cold voice.\u201c\u2026The people who were with me either died or were seriously injured.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dLock groaned but John only looked at Rosalyn.\u2018Noonim, she\u2026\u2019His sister was angry right now.She was also sad.\u201cOne of the people who were with me was a traitor.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it the diplomat?\u201d\u201cJohn, you truly are smart.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dJohn knew that he was not smart.However, he simply guessed that someone from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be the traitor since the head of that ministry was serving the Archduke.There were only a few people accompanying Rosalyn to the Whipper Kingdom. The king\u2019s shadows, a diplomat, an attendant, and a few knights were with her so that they could move stealthily and efficiently.Naturally, Rosalyn and the king felt that they were all confidants they could trust.\u201cA paralyzing poison was put into my food and the food of some of the shadows. It wasn\u2019t too strong, but we were unable to properly react to the sudden attack.\u201dRosalyn recalled the moment when she was attacked.She had recalled this memory tens, no, hundreds of times.Hundreds of people suddenly surrounded their carriage and group. Then the attack started.Rosalyn thought about the people who protected her until the end.\u201cAll of the bastards the Archduke sent are dead.\u201dShe did not leave even one bastard alive. The few who started running away to inform the Archduke about Rosalyn\u2019s magic abilities all died as well.It had been a dark night. Rosalyn, who was thinking about that time when she thoroughly searched through the forest, opened her mouth.\u201cThe Archduke\u2019s household broke the fundamental rule.\u201dJohn thought about the ironclad rule that had been in place since the birth of the Archduke\u2019s household.\u201cThe Archduke\u2019s household\u2026\u201dThe royal family could deny the existence of the Archduke\u2019s household if they broke this rule.The Archduke\u2019s household\u2026\u201cIs not allowed to have troops.\u201dThe king from 200 years ago prohibited the Archduke\u2019s household from having troops because he was worried that it might hinder or threaten the second child. Surprisingly, it was the older son who asked for that first.The Archduke\u2019s household was a good partner and rival to the royal family at that time. The Archduke gathered the opinions of the nobles and scholars to make suggestions or confront the royal family in politics and administration.That was why the Breck Kingdom was able to be maintained so well until now. However, that confrontation slowly changed.Rosalyn calmly commented.\u201cThe Archduke\u2019s household broke the fundamental rule.\u201dJohn recalled what the king had said.\u2018There was a reason the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t want us to reveal that Rosalyn was missing. The Archduke\u2019s side wanted to find Rosalyn first. They wanted to find her first and-!\u2019He couldn\u2019t finish the sentence as he couldn\u2019t forget the wrath on the king\u2019s face nor the queen\u2019s pale face.\u201cJohn. I\u2019m going to take down the Archduke\u2019s household.\u201d\u201c\u2026Noonim.\u201dJohn called out to Rosalyn in a low voice after hearing what he thought she might say. However, Rosalyn\u2019s gaze was that of someone who had made up their mind.\u201cThere will be internal conflict in the Breck Kingdom if we leave the Archduke\u2019s household as is. But this is not the time to let something like that happen.\u201dThe plaza in the Roan Kingdom\u2019s capital\u2026 The attack and Magic Bomb Terror Incident that happened in the middle of the day\u2026The enemy behind it was an unknown being.\u2018The peace was long.\u2019Rosalyn thought that the peace on the Western continent had been too long and that battles might happen to go against this peace.Actually, she was almost certain about it.\u2018An internal conflict in such a situation would only be cutting away at the kingdom\u2019s lifeline.\u2019Rosalyn wanted to protect her kingdom, her home.\u2018But I am lacking when it comes to doing that.\u2019There was something she wanted to do, something she treasured as much as the kingdom.\u201cMy friends and I will soon deal with the Archduke\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cNoonim, the nobles will riot if you do that.\u201dJohn thought that Rosalyn would have proof that the Archduke was responsible for the attack.However, even the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in the Archduke\u2019s hands. The noble faction followed the Archduke.Taking care of the Archduke\u2019s household quickly without even talking to the nobles about it in such a situation was likely to cause the noble faction to riot in some form or fashion.And that riot\u2026\u201cNoonim, you know how it would be. If the nobles riot-\u201d\u201cMy position might be in danger? You\u2019re trying to say that they might make me their enemy because they can\u2019t turn the royal family into their enemy?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dRosalyn looked at John.\u201cI\u2019m not going to become Queen.\u201d\u201cNoonim!\u201dJohn jumped up from the chair.Rosalyn gently smiled.\u201cJohn. I love this kingdom. I love this land and its citizens. They are important to me. I treasure them.\u201dShe closed her eyes.She recalled the sight of the capital as she looked down from the highest spot in the palace.\u201cHowever.\u201d\u2018Yes, even while looking at the sight, I\u2026\u2019\u201cIt is not my dream.\u201d\u2018I want to do magic that will let me fly in the sky.\u2019\u201cCan you understand the difference?\u201dJohn looked into Rosalyn\u2019s eyes before sitting back down. He then sighed as he responded.\u201cOf course I do.\u201dJohn spoke freely to his sister as he used to do when he was younger.\u201c\u2026I understand it very well.\u201dDuring that time in the past when Rosalyn was thinking about doing magic that would let her fly in the sky, John had been next to her taking in the view of the Breck Kingdom from the capital to the horizon. He couldn\u2019t forget the sight of the yellow wheat from the good harvest and the citizens working on the farms in the distance.\u201cJohn, your dream is the kingdom, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRosalyn knew about her brother\u2019s dream.While she finished everything she needed to learn as a member of the royal family and studied magic deep into the night\u2026 The light in the study in John\u2019s Palace was always lit.\u201cJohn. You are most like me among all of our siblings.\u201d\u201cBecause I too only look toward my dreams as I live.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe two of them were silent for a moment.Lock was observing Rosalyn, who seemed oddly different from her usual self, before turning away. Choi Han was looking out the window with an odd smile on his face.\u201cI will somehow convince Royal Father and Royal Mother.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huuuuuu.\u201dJohn let out a short sigh at Rosalyn\u2019s comment. Rosalyn smiled before continuing to speak.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to be very loud while taking care of the Archduke\u2019s household. It won\u2019t take very long.\u201dShe was planning on making it such a big deal that the whole kingdom would be talking about it.\u201cWhile I do that, John, you-\u201d\u201cTake care of the palace?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dRosalyn couldn\u2019t hide her pleasure at John who understood what she wanted right away. John looked away after seeing Rosalyn\u2019s gaze and added on.\u201cI\u2019m not going to get rid of everybody who followed the Archduke. I will only capture the ones who lied to the royal family and tried to trick us; the ones who show potential signs of causing internal conflict.\u201d\u201cYou already have a list?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have an accurate list yet. It looks like you\u2019ll have to help me a bit.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it together.\u201dRosalyn extended her hand and John grabbed it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only the black boulders were maintaining their shapes.\u201cThe only things here are rocks.\u201dThe dried trees were all black regardless of their heights, and there were no grass nor wildflowers around them.Furthermore, the sky was the color of ash and did not even allow the tiniest amount of sunlight to reach the ground.\u201cTsk.\u201dThe God of Death clicked his tongue and continued walking to the top of the mountain to meet the owner of this land.\u201cHey!\u201dHe shouted toward the small temple on top of the mountain.Actually, it was just a shabby little hut rather than a temple.\u201cHey Shield dude!\u201dOne of the two people on a bench in the yard outside the hut turned his head and scowled after seeing the God of Death.\u201cThat stupid bastard! I told him not to call you like that!\u201d\u201cWhy are you getting angry? Are you the shield dude? The person he is talking about is calm so why are you throwing a fit? Are you petty as well since you\u2019re a cheapskate? And how dare you call a god a stupid bastard? Look at this punk constantly crossing the line.\u201d\u201cOw!\u201dThe person shouting at the God of Death could not hold back his anger and clenched his hair with both hands.His long rose-gold hair fluttered like burning fire in the air.The God of Death snorted at this and sat down on one side of the bench.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dThe other person of the two greeted the God of Death with a gruff expression on his face. He then turned his gaze and silently wiped a rock shield that was so old that it was cracked.\u201cHey Shield dude.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour disciple crossed over another mountain.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahem.\u201d\u201cYou smiled right now, didn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you?\u201dThe corners of the gruff man\u2019s mouth slightly twitched and the God of Death did not miss it. The corners of the man with the long rose-gold hair\u2019s lips also twitched, but the God of Death paid him no attention.He seemed to be teasing the man wiping the rock shield as he asked.\u201cDoes it make you happy? But it seems like you already knew about it. Were you watching everything despite pretending not to care? Hmm?\u201dThe God of Death became entertained seeing the extremely gruff man show a reaction as he continued talking.\u201cOh, God of Death.\u201dThe man put the shield down at that moment.The God of Death flinched and stopped talking.\u201c\u2026Did I tease you a bit too much?\u201dHe warily peeked at the man as he asked. It was because it would cause quite the headache if this man in front of him became angry.However, the man did not answer the God of Death\u2019s question. He said something else instead.\u201cOh God of Death, please take good care of Jung Gun.\u201dThe expression disappeared from the God of Death\u2019s face.\u201cCage as well.\u201dThe God of Death then sighed after hearing the second name. He then shrugged his shoulders in an exaggerated manner.\u201cI told you that there is nothing I can do about that punk Jung Gun. They don\u2019t look like it, but the kiddos from the Choi family are all super stubborn!\u201d\u201cAs stubborn as you though?\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course!\u201dThe God of Death admitted it.\u201cOf course they are not as stubborn as me!\u201dHe grumbled with an unhappy expression on his face.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why that punk Cage\u2019s personality is getting worse and worse! I mean I know it was terrible even when she was young! What kind of seven year old tells a god to shut up?!\u201d\u201cSo are you going to turn away from everyone?\u201dThe God of Death\u2019s exaggerated shrugs stopped and his shoulders slumped down to normal.There was a short moment of silence before the God of Death looked at the desolate ground and broke the silence.\u201cOh God of Protection.\u201dHe spoke again to the man wiping the old shield.\u201cTurn away? You know very well that I cannot do that.\u201dThe man wiping the shield did not respond at all. However, the God of Death chuckled after seeing him slowly smile.Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-A breeze brushed past the God of Death\u2019s face. He spoke almost in a sigh.\u201cWhy was it determined that gods were not born but made?\u201d\u201cIs it hard?\u201d\u201cDo you think it wouldn\u2019t be hard? My goodness-\u201dHe stopped for a moment before continuing.\u201cI tried to become desensitized, but it\u2019s not going well.\u201d\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI really hate sacrificing a few for the greater good.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you brought that child over?\u201d\u201c\u2026Kim Rok Soo?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t deny that.\u201dHe stood up from the bench.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201dThe man wiping the shield said goodbye to the God of Death without even looking at him. The God of Death did not look at him as he walked out of the hut.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d\u201cHey idiot.\u201dThe God of Death looked at the man with the rose-gold colored hair who called him an idiot.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man scratched at his rose gold colored hair and walked up to the God of Death to speak in a quiet voice after hearing that uninterested response.\u201cCheer up. We have booze here, so come if you get frustrated. I can at least give that much to an idiot like you.\u201dThe God of Death shook his head as he started walking again.\u201cOw, that son of a bitch! He\u2019s always like this even when I\u2019m trying to be nice to him!\u201dHe heard an extremely annoyed voice behind his back but he ignored it.However, he then heard a voice he could not ignore.The God of Protection. He heard his voice.It was not in his ear, but in his mind.\u2013 Single-lifers are born with large plates.\u2013 However, plates can always get even bigger.\u2013 And they earn a qualification when their plates get bigger.\u2013 However, there is only one way for the plate to get bigger.\u2013 Sacrifice.\u2013 Forcing countless sacrifices or committing countless sacrifices.\u2013 Either taking away numerous lives or protecting numerous lives.\u2013 When the person\u2019s body breaks multiple times in the name of protection\u2026\u2013 Their plate will get bigger.The God of Death chuckled and quietly mumbled.\u201cLike you?\u201dThe God of Protection\u2019s voice was still speaking in his mind.He heard a voice as sturdy as a boulder in his mind.\u2013 Like you.\u201cPffft.\u201dThe God of Death started walking. He then mumbled quietly but loud enough for the owner of this land to hear.\u201cDon\u2019t cross the line. Shield dude.\u201d\u2013 You too. Do not get involved anymore.\u201cOkay, okay.\u201dThe God of Death almost stomped away with annoyance.\u201cI don\u2019t plan on messing with Kim Rok Soo anymore. Other than maybe to help him. You care about him so damn much.\u201dHe let out a short sigh.\u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d* * *In a dark house without any light\u2026He looked at the bookshelves filling his house and reached toward it.A book landed on his palm.Shhh.< I decided to start including Kim Rok Soo from Earth 2 to my list of observation candidates starting today. >The God of Death sat on his couch and started reading through his observation journal.=====Journal entry #XXXXI decided to start including Kim Rok Soo from Earth 2 to my list of observation candidates starting today.Basically, Kim Rok Soo was born today.This guy has quite a terrible fate in store for him.It is probably because he is affected by that reincarnator who calls himself the second White Star.Tsk.Kim Rok Soo\u2019s parents were lonely people as well.However, two lonely people managed to find each other and create a family to earn their own little happiness, but\u2026It looks like Kim Rok Soo will be even lonelier than they were.I\u2019m going to have to barge into the house of those fortune telling punks to look into Kim Rok Soo\u2019s future at some point. Being alone in the world is extremely sad.Man, what a poor little guy.I should tell Choi Jung Gun to inspect this kid\u2019s surroundings every so often.But\u2026 it is highly likely that that bastard won\u2019t listen to me. That rotten bastard.=====The God of Death waved his hand in the air.A few books from the mountain of books filling the bookshelves floated up and opened on their own.These were journals he had personally written.The words floated up from the books and showed the records in the air.=====Journal entry #XXXXChoi Han is still idling away in the Forest of Darkness.Why does this kid not think about leaving the forest?Yes. I guess that is understandable. Choi Han is not strong yet.But why doesn\u2019t he search the nearby area?Can\u2019t you inherit the power of the God of Protection that is there? Then that\u2019ll be good for you!I can\u2019t help but recall something the Shield dude said.What was it again? Was it something about how his plate isn\u2019t the issue, but that he doesn\u2019t have the character to take that power?Where else is there going to be a good and innocent punk like Choi Han? He\u2019s just a bit strange, that\u2019s all.Of course, the Shield dude always talks about how that power is for a bad but good guy, but\u2026 In my opinion, the Shield dude and Choi Han are two peas in a pod. Hehe.Anyway, whether it is Choi Han or the Shield dude, what can I do about these two young little punks? Seriously, haaa. They\u2019re both so frustrating.=====The God of Death waved his hand in the air again.There was now a glass full of wine in his hand.=====Journal entry #XXXXHaaa. That White Star son of a bitch, if I was still human I would have smacked his fucking face at least two thousand times.Should I just go beat him up? No. I can\u2019t do that. That world would hate me if I personally stepped in.Haa\u2026 It\u2019s so annoying.It\u2019s annoying even to write these entries.The White Star found a new ancient power today.The End.I should just go drink all of the Shield dude\u2019s booze.Tsk.Ah, but Cage is growing well.What a cute kiddo. I hope that she at least doesn\u2019t starve nor eat weird things and grows up eating everything she wants to eat, but I really want her to stop ignoring me.It makes me a bit sad.=====\u201cThat punk White Star is done for now.\u201dThe God of Death took a sip of wine.The White Star wasn\u2019t the only one who was gone.\u201cThe sealed god won\u2019t be able to get out into the world ever again either.\u201dAnd the reason that was possible\u2026\u201cShould I say it is all thanks to Kim Rok Soo?\u201dNo.There were others who were responsible as well.All things had many people who could be said to be responsible for it. The God of Death\u2019s eyes headed toward an entry floating in the corner.=====Journal entry #XXXA single-lifer was born after tens of years, generation after generation, in the Choi family of Earth 2. However, nobody from that family has ever risen to become a god.Why is that the case?Is it because they were born with personalities that were better suited as extremely stubborn subordinates than leaders?Ah, I am not talking about Choi Jung Gun.That punk isn\u2019t even a subordinate.He\u2019s just someone I made a deal with.It is the truth.There is no way that I would think that that bastard, that extremely rude bastard, is a precious subordinate of mine!I mean it!Anyway, it is quite a peculiar household.=====Screeeech-The God of Death heard the door to his house open behind him, but didn\u2019t look back. He started speaking instead.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe God of Death summoned a couch and offered the couch and a cup of wine to the individual who walked up next to him.\u201cHere. Have a drink.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Are you reading your journals again?\u201d\u201cYes. I need to go through them at least once.\u201d\u201cBecause your mistakes are written in them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I am not omnipotent.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dThe God of Death turned toward the individual who snorted.He could not see the individual.This individual definitely existed, but was not visible in the darkness.The God of Death opened his mouth.\u201cSo, what brings the Sun God here? You\u2019re not a god who would show up for no reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2014Translator\u2019s Comments\u201cThe only things here are rocks.\u201d (PR: Sexy)TCF is currently posted Mondays and Fridays at evening time GMT.

Ask away. I\u2019m in quite the good mood so I\u2019ll answer any one question you may have, Sun God.\u201dThey were both silent for a moment.\u201cOh, God of Death.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIs there really no existence that could bestow death to a god?\u201dCrack.The wine glass in the God of Death\u2019s hand cracked and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cI was in a good mood but not anymore.\u201dA smile appeared on the God of Death\u2019s face.\u201cSo it looks like I won\u2019t be able to answer your question.\u201d\u201c\u2026More than anybody else.\u201dThe Sun God asked in a calm voice.\u201cWeren\u2019t you the god who wanted death more than anybody else and sought out that method?\u201d\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dThe God of Death let out a deep sigh and responded in an emotionless voice.\u201cI did not manage to find such a method.\u201dThe God of Death\u2019s eyes slowly sank low and held no emotions. The voice flowing out of his mouth was heavy but held no emotions either.\u201cOh, Sun God. You are not looking for eternal death but \u2018death.\u2019 And the beings who are allowed to experience that \u2018death\u2019 are only ones who can be reborn to live new lives.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs it that you want to be reborn as a human again?\u201dThe God of Death did not wait for the silent Sun God\u2019s response and continued to speak.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are hoping for with those thoughts but let go of useless dreams.\u201dHis voice was quite firm.Don\u2019t both you and I have the burdens of mistakes to carry?\u201dThe Sun God finally responded after a long time.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThere was a moment of silence between the two gods again. The God of Death didn\u2019t put much deep thoughts into it and simply seeped into this stillness as if he was water flowing through.He heard the Sun God\u2019s voice at that moment and it pulled his mind out of the surface of the stillness.\u201cIs it Lee Soo Hyuk?\u201dA deep wrinkle appeared on the God of Death\u2019s forehead.\u201cThe human you have with you.\u201dPlop. Plop.A few of the observation journals floating in the air fell to the ground. The God of Death spoke in a low voice.\u201cHey you damn bundle of light.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018This Sun God bitch has no tact at all, no tact.\u2019\u201cHey you damn bundle of light, that kid used to work for me. Don\u2019t mess with him.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not saying it because I want to mess with him.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dThis damn bundle of light, the Sun God, was the lunatic who did all sorts of things in the past because she hated the dark attribute so much. The God of Death did not trust this woman. The Sun God must have realized this as she let out a short sigh and mumbled.\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but be envious of Lee Soo Hyuk. I was envious of the fact that he could live a new life, a life that is not eternal.\u201dThe God of Death snorted.\u201cOh damn bundle of light. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea.\u201dHe corrected the Sun God\u2019s delusion.\u201cGods do not have lives. We simply have a duration of existence.\u201dThat was the way of life for individuals who were imprinted with eternal life.\u201cIs that your answer, oh God of Death?\u201d\u201cIt is not my answer but my belief.\u201dBelief was something that could overcome existence.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be heading back now.\u201d\u201cAlright, hurry up and go, go.\u201dThe God of Death could finally be alone in his place.He slowly took a few steps and bent down. He picked up a few of the observation journals that had fallen to the floor.As he bent down once more to pick up the last remaining journal\u2026 He could see an entry from a certain day.=====Journal entry #XXXXXChoi Jung Soo rejected my offer.Kim Rok Soo remained alive.I thought that I would understand humans and their inner thoughts very well once I became a god, but\u2026 Although I can faintly see the end of humans, I still cannot understand their inner thoughts.That was why gods who had more abilities and powers could not be heroes but humans, who are lacking quite a bit in those aspects, could become heroes.This Lee Soo Hyuk bastard isn\u2019t much but\u2026 He\u2019s a bit special. I think that he is special every time I see him.I should bring both of them with me.But I am a bit scared of Choi Jung Gun. What if he comes and destroys everything in my office again?I should go hide in the Shield dude\u2019s house. No. That bastard has a weak spot for Choi Jung Gun so he will probably capture me and hand me over to Choi Jung Gun.Then, mm, the Sun God\u2026 I should stealthily go hide in the Sun God\u2019s warehouse.=====\u201cThat was the first time I was beaten by a broom since I became a god.\u201dThat broom was naturally in the Sun God\u2019s warehouse and something used by those who served the Sun God.\u2018Dead. Today. You.\u2019\u2018But gods cannot die?\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll make you think that dying would have been better.\u2019Choi Jung Gun had commented in a low voice before swinging the broom with his sword arts and the God of Death couldn\u2019t help but get the chills any time he thought about that moment.\u2018I like the fact that you cannot die.\u2019\u2018Hmm?\u2019\u2018You\u2019re not going to die no matter how much I beat you up or cut you down.\u2019This was the day I learned that the Choi family was filled with normal-looking bastards who were completely out of their minds the farther you go up the family tree.\u201cWas this when it started?\u201dChanges had happened to the God of Death\u2019s observation journals.=====Number XXXXXPeople at the company were calling Kim Rok Soo cold-blooded.It was understandable.He had never had work piled up even after his friends died, he ate all three meals a day properly, and his clothes were tidy.He showed no issues whatsoever.He did not turn down working late and seemed obsessed with work.However, this punk hasn\u2019t been able to sleep properly since he survived.Who cares if he is eating well when he can\u2019t sleep well?Of course, he himself does not seem to feel the problematic issue of his sleep.=====An existence that survived when he was supposed to die.My interest in him couldn\u2019t disappear.At least not until he died.=====Journal entry #XXXXXKim Rok Soo looks lonely.No.He doesn\u2019t even seem to know what loneliness is.=====\u201cHmm.\u201dChh. Chhh.The journal entries continued.Observation of the White Star and the world. Information about other dimensions and worlds.There were a lot of worlds for the God of Death to observe.\u201cThere really is a lot.\u201dDespite that, observations of Kim Rok Soo were recorded in each day\u2019s journal entry.=====He got another large scar fighting in the vanguard.Lee Soo Hyuk, who was watching this next to me, laughed in a low voice and I couldn\u2019t help but be scared despite being a god.Is he really human?I can\u2019t help but question it every so often.This guy is definitely an average bastard but he doesn\u2019t seem like an average bastard.==========Kim Rok Soo is sleeping well today.Cage is sleeping well too.Both Cage and Kim Rok Soo are growing well.Of course both of them are adults already, but they are continuing to get fitter.Cage is a priestess but is she planning on taking the path of a fighter?==========I am already busy enough with all the dimensions I need to maintain, but this White Star son of a bitch keeps annoying me.I\u2019m already heated up because those Hunter bastards keep causing issues everywhere\u2026 I\u2026 The White Star\u2026 I really want to punch him.I started observing Cage to get some healing and watched as she downed a giant jug of booze.\u2026Yeah, I guess it\u2019s good to consume a large amount no matter what it is.Mm. But shouldn\u2019t Kim Rok Soo eat something while working?Ahh, Choi Jung Soo is coming. I should stop writing now. I know that he will respectfully ask me what I was plotting while looking at me with a vicious gaze if he notices me observing Kim Rok Soo.Of course, I am indeed plotting something.=====\u201cMm.\u201dThe God of Death reached out his hand. Another book floated up and revealed the words inside in the air.=====Journal entry #XXXXXKim Rok Soo and Cale Henituse switched bodies in the end.This is the last move I had remaining.=====Kim Rok Soo was a variable and a mutant.\u201dAnd that last move\u2026\u201cIt was the best.\u201dIt was the best move the God of Death had available.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026You knew I was here?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dA small wolf appeared from the darkness.Single-lifers were not only for humans. Any living creature in the world could be a single-lifer.This wolf had blue fur that seemed to sparkle in silver.\u201cDeath, your move was not a good move.\u201d\u201cWas it really not?\u201d\u201cBut this child turned that move into a good one.\u201dThe small wolf used his front paw to lightly tap the words Kim Rok Soo floating above the journal.\u201cAnd the existences around that child also created good results.\u201dThe small wolf\u2019s dark blue eyes were full of wisdom.\u201cIt is because everybody gave it their best.\u201d\u201cYour child gave it his best as well.\u201dThe wolf smiled bitterly at the God of Death\u2019s comment. The God of Death looked at him with pity before opening his mouth.\u201c\u2026Why did you come to my house?\u201d\u201cI just stopped by while passing through.\u201dThe wolf turned around without any hesitation.\u201cThen I will be on my way now. It\u2019ll be bad if others see me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you want a drink?\u201dThe wolf shook his head without looking back.\u201cYou may be disowned if you drink with an existence that has been disowned by the gods.\u201d\u201cYour descendant might help you regain your status.\u201d\u201cI.\u201dThe wolf looked at the God of Death. The God of Death subconsciously flinched at the eyes that had a thick aura like the gods who had kept their positions since before ancient times.The wolf muttered on.\u201cI simply wish for my children to have peace.\u201dThe wolf then disappeared into the darkness.\u201cHaaaaa.\u201dOnce the aura that seemed to bind his body disappeared and he was left alone, the God of Death ruffled through his hair and plopped down on the ground.\u201c\u2026He is an existence that has existed since before ancient times. He might be in the top five if we don\u2019t consider the status.\u201dAlthough he was not welcomed by anybody in this world right now and his descendants were creatures that had their existence questioned\u2026\u201cHmm. Was that child named Lock the candidate for the Wolf King?\u201dIt would be good if that child could decipher the secret.That someone who has no place of his own and can only roam would have a place to return to.\u201cAh, but seriously. Anybody comes into my house as they please. Should I just lock the door?\u201dThe God of Death had purposely made it so that anybody could come into his territory as they pleased but he couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed more and more as multiple existences popped in randomly like this.\u201cYo.\u201dHe heard a new voice at that moment and the emotion disappeared from the God of Death\u2019s face.\u201cYou finally captured the sealed god in your hand?\u201d\u201cOh, God of Hope. What brings you here, sir?\u201dExistences that were here before ancient times\u2026 The few gods who had too much status to retire and have not stepped down from their positions because nobody with enough abilities to replace them has appeared\u2026One of those gods, the God of Hope, had come to see the God of Death.The God of Death\u2019s heart sank down at the fact that someone who was known for rarely getting his butt out of his place came to see him.\u201cI\u2019m sure you are well aware as to why I am here.\u201dThe God of Hope only moved during special times.The God of Death mumbled those times.\u201cWhere hope appears.\u201dAnd\u2026\u201cBefore hope disappears.\u201dAnd finally\u2026\u201cBefore an existence with hope falls in danger.\u201dThe God of Hope smiled and nodded his head.\u201cYes, you are well aware.\u201dThe God of Death looked toward the small light flickering in the darkness.That was the God of Hope.He was a small faint light that could not be seen under light, one that was clearly visible in the darkness but something that looked as if it could go out at any moment.However, that light had never gone out since the dawn of time and nothing existed in this Divine World that could destroy this light.Even the \u2018law\u2019 could not destroy this light.The God of Hope never showed his appearance and always traveled looking like this. He claimed that even among his fellow gods only those with the qualification could see him.\u201cChild.\u201dThe God of Hope always called the God of Death child.This god probably saw all existence as children.\u201cI want you to protect the seed of qualification.\u201dThe God of Death\u2019s eyes clouded over.The small blinking light disappeared at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of them must be the seed.There were a few people who came to his mind immediately as potential candidates.\u201cCale Henituse, Choi Han, Ahn Roh Man, Schatten Wilson, Wi Sehwa\u2026\u2026\u201dThere were quite a few now that he counted through them.\u201cHaaaa.\u201dHis mind started to turn into a complicated mess.There were still quite a few elements of danger remaining. To be more specific, they were elements that could cause chaos rather than danger.In that aspect, the God of Chaos was someone who had kept his position a long time similar to the God of Hope.\u201cMm.\u201dThe God of Death buried his body into the couch and started to think about the elements of danger. He then subconsciously said one word out loud.\u201c\u2026Hunters\u2026\u2026\u201dAn emotion as intense as a wildfire burst in his mind at that moment.Oooooooong- Ooooooooong-The area started to rumble.The God of Death scowled and closed his eyes. He needed to calm the wildfire in his heart.It was at that moment.Chhhhhh-Chhhhh-The area around him started to move on its own without his orders.This was the God of Death\u2019s house. The house was moving items on his behalf.The God of Death opened his eyes in response.\u201cHa!\u201dHe scoffed after looking at the page of the book that was in front of him.Of the numerous journal entries he had, the entries for some specific days had been opened.=====Journal entry #XXXXXKim Rok Soo, no, no. I should call him something else now.Cale Henituse used his Indestructible Shield at the capital today to save the lives of many people.Choi Jung Soo smiled with such satisfaction at that.Although he said he was suited for outside work and kept telling me he hated assisting with office work\u2026 Seeing Cale\u2019s performance today made him say that he will focus on office work for a while and asked me for documents to handle.He\u2019s a funny bastard.Mm. It would have been good if Lee Soo Hyuk was here today too. That punk seems to be pretty busy right now trying to take care of all of his relationships here while working hard to get used to the other world.It makes sense since there are a lot of things to prepare and persist through in order to reincarnate in that world with all of his memories. I should tease him about how he missed a good show when he shows up again. Hehe.Anyway, we decided to eat out to celebrate what Choi Jung Soo called, \u2018watching Cale Henituse who threw himself into the fire as he always does.\u2019I should steal the booze for our meal from the Sun God\u2019s warehouse. Ah, will Cage potentially listen to me if I give her a taste of the Sun God\u2019s handmade booze? It tastes wonderful.Anyway, that punk Cale Henituse has so much affection for others.=====The God of Death remembered a moment when he had been happy.He calmed himself down at this house, this domain consoling him and grabbed a journal floating in the air.Shhhh, shhhh.=====Raon\u2026That child\u2019s fate has completely changed now that he has a name.Isn\u2019t this marvelous?Fate is something that feels like it cannot be changed, but a small act of goodwill, something as trivial as a heart that would not let him avoid such a thing could change it.Even the God of Fate should not be able to ascertain their lives now that two beings with changed fates are together.=====The God of Death thought about Cale Henituse, the human he had spent the most time observing lately.Although he was simply observing one punk, it allowed him to also watch as Cale changed the lives of the individuals around him.Cale Henituse, the original Kim Rok Soo was the last card the God of Death had up his sleeve, but he never expected that card to do things so well.\u201cIt\u2019s probably because he didn\u2019t try to do well.\u201dThe reason Cale Henituse had been able to do everything until now was not because he had a desire to do well but because he was trying to protect things no matter what it took.That was the reason even that Shield dude started observing Cale Henituse at some point and is preparing to stealthily help him.A line in the journal caught the God of Death\u2019s attention.=====It looks like Cale Henituse has a family now.=====What would not being lonely mean for Cale Henituse as someone who spent most of his life being lonely?\u201cAren\u2019t I the bastard who used him knowing that was the case?\u201dHe had not put that punk Kim Rok Soo in Cale Henituse\u2019s body after only seeing his situation as Kim Rok Soo.If Kim Rok Soo were to become Cale Henituse\u2026 Based on his personality\u2026If he had information to get stronger\u2026Wouldn\u2019t he manage to achieve something?That was the reason he was the last card the God of Death could use.In the end, Cale Henituse did even better than he had expected and was creating a place for himself in that world.\u201cIt\u2019s such a relief-\u201dPlop. Plop.The journal fell to the ground.Crack crack.He heard his domain breaking.This domain that was placed within the darkness\u2026 This domain that was so familiar to the God of Death for that reason was starting to feel unfamiliar.Shaaaaaaaaaaaa-A breeze blew by him.That breeze was cold but dry.The being who cast this kind of breeze as he moved\u2026The God of Death jumped up from his seat.\u201cMotherf- ugh!\u201dHowever, his body soon fell forward.Boom!His body hit the ground. He tried to raise his body but an intangible force pushing down from all directions made it impossible to move.He barely managed to turn his head. His cheek touched the ground. There were beads of sweat on his face despite it being on the cold ground.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dClick click.The God of Death heard the sound of leather shoes before he saw some grey shoes stop in front of him. He rolled his eyes to look up.However, once he got past the body of the individual in front of him and just reached that individual\u2019s neck\u2026\u201cYou have a rebellious gaze every time I see you.\u201d\u201cCough, ugh!\u201dThe God of Death had to curl his body because of a pain that made it feel as if his body was being twisted. His gaze could not see the face above the neck.However, he was very well aware of the individual who came to find him.The God of Balance.Someone who, like Hope and Chaos, had maintained his position as a god since a long time ago as there was nobody to replace him.\u201cHuuff, huuuuuff!\u201dThe God of Death could not breathe properly from the pain that twisted his whole body and his inner organs. However, his mind was calmer than expected even through all of that.\u2018He must have been watching and come to see me now that one thing has been resolved.\u2019The God of Hope and God of Balance, who had only been observing until now, made their move now that the God of Death\u2019s second problem of the White Star and the Sealed God was decently resolved.He couldn\u2019t tell why the God of Hope had made his move, but he could understand why the God of Balance had moved.\u2018That was why I was avoiding him!Fuck.\u2019The God of Death\u2019s whole body was in pain. It felt as if he would be ripped to shreds.He heard the God of Balance\u2019s condescending but stoic voice.\u201cYou acted too cheeky.\u201dBalance.That was an existence distant from good and evil.It was not a matter of judgment.It was to not lean in favor of either direction.\u201cYou need to limit how much you twist things. Do you know how difficult it has been for the children who look at fate?\u201d\u201cUgh, ugh!\u201dThe God of Death did everything he could to raise his head and look at this individual.However, his body would only shake and not move as he wanted it to move.\u201cThe former God of Death was not like this.\u201dShaaaaaaaaaaaa-He felt a cold breeze.Plop. Plop. Plop.A few of the journals from the bookshelf in the corner of the room fell to the ground.A rolled up piece of paper was hidden behind those journals.\u2018Fuck!\u2019The God of Death realized what the God of Balance was taking out and scowled.Plop.The rolled up paper opened before it fell right in front of the God of Death.This paper was a Book of the Dead.< Alberu Crossman >< Deruth Henituse >< Rosalyn >< Lock >< Ron Molan >It was the Book of the Dead with the list of names of people who should have died.They were individuals who were fated to die if the real Henituse, who was born with the life of a transmigrator, did not get the ability to regress back in time.Click. Click.The grey shoes arrived in front of the God of Death\u2019s face.The God of Death could hear the voice that was echoing above his head as if it would strike down at him.\u201cHow can you, as the God of Death, be so lost in saving lives?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe pain in his body became even worse.The stoic voice continued speaking as the God of Death did everything he could to resist the pain.\u201cYou saved too many lives. The balance will be destroyed if you do that.\u201dThe corners of the God of Death\u2019s lips slightly curled up even through the pain.It meant that what he did saved so many lives to the point that this guy was worried about the balance.\u201cTsk.\u201dThe God of Balance clicked his tongue as if he could tell the God of Death was smiling despite being unable to see Death\u2019s face.He spoke as if he was making an announcement.\u201cI simply let it be as I found the sealed god to be unacceptable. I closed my eyes to what you did only because you did not move to resolve your grudges. There will be no next time.\u201dThe pain disappeared a bit.The God of Death raised his head.Yellow eyes were glowing in the darkness.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see that rebellious gaze of yours.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe God of Death\u2019s entire body was filled with intense pain again and he could only roll on the ground in an unsightly manner.\u201cUnderstand your place properly.\u201dClick. Click.The steps became distant.The God of Death was able to escape from the pain once he could not hear them anymore.\u201cHuff. Huff.\u201dHe caught his breath, put some strength into his shaking hands, and barely managed to lift himself up. His whole body was covered in sweat.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dHe let out a deep breath and thought about the sudden appearance of the God of Balance.\u2018I guess he came to warn me.\u2019All sorts of things such as dimension travel, transmigration, and regression had happened in order to deal with the sealed god and the White Star.The God of Balance had let enough things go as is.But the fact that he appeared now-\u201cDoes that mean there\u2019s another reason for me to move?\u201dOf course, even the God of Death was basically certain that things will happen that will annoy him quite a bit.That was why he could understand what the God of Balance was worried about. However, the God of Balance did not know that just warning him was useless.\u2018It looks like the Shield dude and bundle of light are going to move too.\u2019Furthermore, even with the God of Balance\u2019s warning, he should be able to feign ignorance and make a couple moves.The God of Hope.That existence told him to protect the seed.Even the God of Balance could not defeat the God of Hope.Hope, from time to time, has a strong enough power that could overcome anything.\u201cHaaaa. Damn it.\u201d\u2018Who the fuck said that it was good to become a god?\u2019The God of Death pushed his complicated head and his body that had finally overcome the pain to stand up and walk.He was planning on resting a bit first but he had no choice.The God of Balance\u2019s voice echoed in his ears.\u2018You saved too many lives. The balance will be destroyed if you do that.\u2019That meant that many people would soon die to fix the destroyed balance.\u201cI need to get consent first.\u201dThe God of Death mumbled about what he needed to do as he walked out of the house.He completely forgot about having to write a journal entry for today.This was the third time he had forgotten to write a journal entry.* * *After some time\u2026\u201cI guess you\u2019re finally up.\u201d\u201cGod?\u201dThe God of Death smiled at Cale Henituse, who was looking at him with quite the insolent expression.This was the day when the God of Death invited Cale Henituse into his domain to chat for the first time.It was also the day that Cale learned that Lee Soo Hyuk had reincarnated into his world.Furthermore, it was the day that the God of Death was able to inform Cale that something that even he, as a god, could not easily discuss, was about to happen.\u201cHuuuuuu.\u201dThe God of Death plopped down on a chair after finishing that short meeting with Cale.He picked up a pen.=====Journal entry #XXXXXI met face to face with Cale Henituse for the first time.He seems to hate me quite a bit.I understand. Even I can tell that I did so many things that would get him to hate me.But it does make me a bit sad.I\u2019ve been watching over Cage and that punk since they were little.I\u2019m concerned.I\u2019m probably going to have to do things like that a few more times. Am I going to get beaten up by Cale Henituse at this rate?\u2026That\u2019ll probably hurt a lot.=====Click. Click.He heard the clicking of shoes outside the office door. He was certain that the God of Balance had arrived.\u201cFuck!\u201dThe God of Death quickly finished his journal entry.=====Anyway, good luck Cale Henituse.I\u2019ll help you a lot. Mm, maybe doing nothing will be helping him?Anyway, good luck!=====\u2013 Side Story 6. The God of Death\u2019s Observation Journal.

The rough hand made the man think of the hands of an exhausted parent. It was that warm.\u201cYoung master, it is morning.\u201dBut the voice was very profound. The man felt chills throughout his body and his eyes subconsciously opened. Rather than the bright sunlight coming in through the window to warm the man\u2019s eyes, what he saw was an old man standing there with a satisfied expression.\u201cIt is surprising to see you wake up after a single attempt.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe master wishes to dine with the young master since it has been a while. It looks like it will be possible today.\u201dThe man could see a mirror past the old man\u2019s shoulder. Inside the mirror was a red-haired man who seemed to be confused looking back at him.\u2018I guess that guy is me.\u2019\u201cYoung master Cale?\u201dThe man turned toward the source of the worried voice to find the old man, who looked like a servant, looking toward him. But that concerned man was not the problem.The man clearly heard it.Young Master Cale. It was a familiar name. He slowly blurted out the name.\u201cCale Henituse?\u201dThe old servant was looking at him like he was looking at his own grandson.\u201cYes. That is your name, young master. I\u2019m guessing you are still a bit drunk.\u201dListening to the concerned response of the old man, the man naturally thought about a name that was even more important than the name Cale Henituse.\u201c...Beacrox.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about my son?\u201d\u201c...Chef.\u201d\u201cYes. My son is the chef. Do you need him to make something for your hangover?\u201dThe man felt his surroundings turn dark and he started to feel dizzy. He lowered his head and put it into his hand.\u201cYoung master, are you still drunk? Should I call the doctor? Or will you wash right now?\u201dThe man looked at the red hair that was falling in front of his face. It was a bright red color, much too different from his original black hair.Cale Henituse. Beacrox. Beacrox\u2019s dad, Ron.They were the characters that appeared at the beginning of [The Birth of a Hero], \u00a0the novel the man was reading before he fell asleep last night.He jerked his head up and looked around. He could see the bedroom that was completely different from a typical Korean design. It made the man think about Europe. Every single thing in the room was extremely extravagant and luxurious.\u201cYoung master?\u201dThe man responded to Ron, the old man who was pretending to be concerned and worried.\u201cCold water.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dHe needed something to clear his mind. He could see the face of Cale Henituse in the mirror behind old man Ron.\u2018Still looks normal.\u2019\u2018I guess Cale hasn\u2019t been beaten to a pulp by the main character just yet. \u2018His handsome face caught his attention.The man had become Cale Henituse when he opened his eyes.Cale Henituse. The trash who was beaten to a pulp by the main character in the beginning of [The Birth of a Hero]. \u00a0That was who he was.\u201cYoung master, I presume you will not be bathing in cold water. Are you asking for drinking water?\u201dCale turned his gaze toward Ron. Ron may be pretending to be a benign old man, but he was actually hiding his true identity as a cruel and vicious individual.He made the request to Ron.\u201cPlease get me some drinking water.\u201dHe needed to drink some cold water and clear his\u00a0mind first.\u201cI will prepare it right away.\u201d\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201dRon flinched for a second and had an odd expression on his face, but Cale did not notice it.***Ron had to leave the bedroom as there was only warm water in the room. Once he was left alone, Cale got off the bed and headed to the bathroom. If he really was inside of the novel, he knew that there should be a large mirror inside.As expected, the full body mirror was inside the bathroom. Cale Henituse, who had a lot of interest in his appearance and physique, had this mirror set up in here. Nobody else in the household had such a mirror.The man in the mirror had red hair and a pretty fit body. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say he had a body that would make any style look good.\u201cI really am Cale.\u201dThe man in the mirror indeed was Cale Henituse from the novel. [The Birth of a Hero] was very descriptive about each of the character\u2019s appearance. That was why the man had no choice but to agree that he had indeed turned into Cale Henituse.Do people usually become calmer when they are surprised and shocked? Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo, calmly thought about the night before.It was a typical day off. It had been a while since he had read an actual book instead of on his phone, so he went to the library to check out some books. He borrowed the entire series since he planned to read all day long.The name of that book was, of course, [The Birth of a Hero]. He managed to finish the fifth volume before he fell asleep. But when he woke up, he had turned into Cale Henituse, the individual that the main character mercilessly beat up in volume 1.\u2018Will things go the way they did in the novel?\u2019He felt unnaturally calm. Once he got past the point of shock, his mind had calmed back down. He started to remember the contents of volume 1.[The Birth of a Hero.]This novel was about the birth of the heroes in the Western and Eastern continents, as well as their trials and growth. The main character was, naturally, Korean. He was a student who had been transported into the world when he was a freshman in high school. Furthermore, his lifespan became as long as a dragon\u2019s lifespan, making him pretty much never age.\u201c... This is bad?\u201dHe was going to be beaten into a pulp by such a person. The important thing, however, was that he had not been beaten up just yet.Cale took his eyes off the mirror and walked into the tub that was full of warm water. He leaned against the tub and looked up at the ceiling. It was that expensive marble that was described in the novel. The estate that Cale lived in was actually full of marble.Cale started to mumble as he looked toward the ceiling.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s much I\u2019ll miss.\u201dHis life as Kim Rok Soo. There really wasn\u2019t much to it. He was an orphan and didn\u2019t have much money. He also didn\u2019t have a person he loved to death, nor a friend he would give his life to save. He only continued to live because he could not die.Yes, he could not die.He completely hated the thought of death or pain. He became an orphan after both of his parents passed away from a car accident when he was little.He didn\u2019t like pain or death. No matter what it was, even if he was rolling in a pile of dog shit, it was still better than being dead.\u2018For that reason, I need to first make sure I don\u2019t get beaten up.\u2019Cale did not know what day it was in the novel right now, but he was sure that he had not met with the main character just yet. The reason was simple.\u2018I don\u2019t have the scar on my side.\u2019Cale Henituse, the trash of Count Henituse\u2019s family. A few days before meeting the main character, Cale was drinking and causing a ruckus. He was flinging things around and got stabbed on his side by a broken desk leg, resulting in the scar.What an interesting character. He didn\u2019t get the scar from fighting someone else. He got it because he got angry that the alcohol didn\u2019t taste good and threw a tantrum. He meets the main character after he gets the scar, and, after a short discussion, he gets beaten to a pulp.\u201cMm.\u201dCale crossed his arms and started to think.He did not know what happened to Cale after getting beaten to a pulp in volume 1. All he knew was that the main character, Choi Han, has many fateful encounters and overcomes a lot of trials to grow into a hero along with his party members.Thus the era for him to prove that he is a hero will begin. The Roan Kingdom that Cale currently lives in, as well as many other locations in the Eastern and Western continents, will be filled with war. It truly will turn into the time for the heroes to show their full potential.Cale started to frown. Kim Rok Soo, the man who became Cale. His life motto was pretty simple.Living long without pain. Enjoying the small joys of life.Living a peaceful life.\u201c... As long as I make the story proceed like normal while taking out the fact that I get beaten up, the main character will take care of the rest.\u201dFor some odd reason, he could recall every single line in the book without any issue. Cale relaxed in the warm water while coming to a final conclusion with his now clear head.\u201cIt\u2019s worth trying.\u201dIt was worth trying to avoid the continent\u2019s war and living peacefully. This trash\u2019s situation was much better than when he was Kim Rok Soo. The location of this estate was also in the corner of the Western Continent, making it an ideal location to avoid the war. In the novel itself, there were many nobles who managed to avoid the influences of war. Even if he could not completely avoid it, he should be able to at least reduce the damages to a minimum.\u201cYoung master, are you inside the bathroom?\u201dHe could hear Ron\u2019s voice coming from outside. Cale thought about Ron\u2019s true identity. Ron was an assassin who crossed over from the Eastern Continent by sea. He pretended to be a benign old man, but the true Ron was a cruel and merciless man.\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201dHis natural response was to talk informally to the old man. Cale realized what he was doing and made up his mind about what to do in the future.He needed to push that old man to the main character and send him away.That old man could easily kill Cale with a single blow, but treated Cale like a puppy you left alone because you felt bad for it. He was smiling gently, but there was not an ounce of care about Cale on the inside. In the novel, Ron leaves with the main character and his son after Choi Han beats Cale to a pulp.Cale put the bathrobe on as he quickly exited the bathroom. Ron was standing there with a smile on his face and a tray with a cup in his hands.\u201cYoung master, here you go.\u201dCale picked up the cup and walked past the old man. He did not want to make eye contact with such a dangerous old man.\u201cGreat, thanks.\u201dRon\u2019s expression turned odd once again, but Cale had already walked past him. Cale took a drink of the cold water as he started to think.\u2018There are too many strong people here.\u2019In fact, there were too many of them. No matter where the main character went, there were either strong individuals or individuals with hidden secrets. These individuals were both human and other races.\u2018I at least need the strength to protect myself.\u2019In order to live long without pain in the continent that will soon be filled with war, you needed a decent level of strength. Of course, you could not be too strong. Then other complicated things will happen.Cale thought about the different fateful encounters that occurred in the beginning parts of the novel. The powers that strengthen the main character and his party members. He was thinking about the ones that would help him live long without pain. There were a couple that came to mind. He just needed to pick one of them.\u201cYoung master, we will start to dress you now.\u201d\u201cOh, right. Thanks.\u201dThe door soon opened and couple servants entered to help Ron dress Cale. Cale did not notice that Ron had a stoic expression unlike his usual self as he looked at the clothes the servants were bringing in.\u201cAh, something simple today.\u201dHe hated really complicated attires. Simple clothes that let you relax comfortably were the best.\u201cYes, young master.\u201dThe servant in charge of the attires quickly pulled out some simple clothes and Cale changed into the simplest of them all. He lightly frowned after finishing getting dressed. Even this, \u2018simple,\u2019 attire was extremely extravagant and not to his liking.However, the reflection in the mirror was quite handsome.\u2018He really is handsome and makes any clothes look good.\u2019The face really was the final piece to fashion. He looked in the mirror and fixed his sleeves before turning around to look at Ron.Ron was once again smiling like a gentle old man.\u201cRon, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dCale walked behind Ron. It was nice that he did not need to know the layout of the estate. He just needed to follow Ron wherever he needed to go. All of the servants that Cale saw flinched and bowed respectfully before they seemed to run away.\u2018Why are they so scared? Cale never hit people.\u2019He just liked to drink and play. Sometimes, when he was drunk, he did break things. But that was why he was the trash of the family. He also did not treat people like people, other than the few people he liked.\u2018Well, it\u2019s better if nobody talks to me.\u2019Cale thought about it peacefully. It would be more difficult if he was in the body of a model citizen. A trash can do as he pleases without worry. It was only possible because there was no desire to live as a model citizen.\u201cI will now open the door.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dCale nodded his head toward Ron. The book mentioned that Cale treated Ron, someone who raised him like he was his own grandson since he was little, as nicely as he treated his own father. It mentioned that he always responded to Ron and treated him like a person. Of course, Ron did not really think that way. That was why it was easy for Cale to talk to Ron. He just needed to answer Ron\u2019s questions and treat him like a human being.\u201cI hope you enjoy your breakfast.\u201d\u201cThanks. Ron, make sure you eat a good meal too.\u201dCale walked past Ron and into the dining room. He could see his family sitting there. His father and the current head of the Henituse household, Deruth. Next to him was Cale\u2019s step mother, the Countess, as well as her son and daughter. The four people looked toward Cale.\u201cYou are late again, today.\u201dCale\u2019s gaze turned toward his father who spoke. [The Birth of a Hero] described Cale\u2019s feelings for his father like this.\u2018His father was the one person that Cale listened to. The reason the trash did not leave the area and got everything he wanted inside the Count\u2019s territory was because of his father, Count Deruth Henituse.\u2019But, unfortunately, Cale\u2019s father was unlike the other strong fathers in this novel. He did not have any special skills or influence. He just had a lot of money. However, Cale liked this a lot. It was the perfect family environment to live a simple life.Then there were the other three individuals.His stepmother who knew that he did not like her and avoided him.Her smart first-born who found it difficult to deal with his much older brother Cale.And the cute youngest of the family who avoided her older brother Cale.But it wasn't like Cale bothered them or they bothered Cale. They just treated each other like strangers.Cale thought this was such a great environment to quietly live alone.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201dCale looked at the feast on the table that did not meet his definition of breakfast and sat down on his seat. He then felt something was odd and lifted his head up.\u201cIs there something you need to say, father?\u201d\u201c... No, I do not.\u201dDeruth was staring at Cale. The rest of the family was doing the same. Cale made eye contact with each of these family members. They all quickly turned away whenever he made eye contact and continued to eat.\u2018I guess they find me really difficult to handle.\u2019Cale turned his head toward the table as well. This luxurious feast that was different than the breakfast he used to eat just to fill his belly made him start to smile. He first started by cutting the sausage in half with the knife.\u2018It is so juicy.\u2019He didn\u2019t know if juice flowed out as soon as he cut into it because it was handmade or because it was cooked well, but the color on the sausage made him hungry. Cale started to smile without realizing it.Clang.He heard something fall down and made eye contact with his younger brother Basen. He could see that Basen had dropped the fork in his hand.\u201cMy apologies.\u201dBasen calmly apologized like the personality described for him in the novel. The servant in charge of the meal quickly came over to hand Basen a new fork and picked up the fork on the floor. Watching that made Cale think that it was nice to be a noble, before he focused once again on the food in front of him.Cale had found the first good thing about coming into the novel. This breakfast was extremely luxurious and so tasty that his stomach was completely happy.The smile on his face could not disappear.\u201c...Ho?\u201dThat was why he did not hear his brother Basen\u2019s shocked proclamation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then moved his fork towards a salad made of fruits that he did not recognize. After filling his stomach with meat, soup, and bread, he wanted to try something new.The fruit looked like an orange, but the color was closer to that of grapes. Cale put the fruit in his mouth and took a bite.\u201cMm.\u201dIn that instant, sweet fruit juice filled his mouth. He really hated sour fruits, so this extremely sweet flavor in his mouth made him subconsciously start to drool.At that moment, he made eye contact with his father Deruth, who was looking at him.\u201cCale.\u201dDeruth quietly called Cale\u2019s name before hesitating. He then started to frown and move his mouth. Cale did not like that awkward atmosphere and started to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cYes, it tastes like trash...huh? Did you say it is delicious?\u201d\u201cYes. Everything tastes wonderful.\u201dCale picked up a different fruit this time and smiled after tasting the sweetness in his mouth once again. The trash, Cale Henituse, never cared for etiquette anyways.He probably shouldn\u2019t do this while speaking with his father, the head of the household, but whatever. He\u2019s just trash in the first place.\u2018It really is best to be the trash.\u2019Nobody really cared no matter what he did. As long as he can prevent himself from getting beaten up by the main character, it will be a good life.As Cale expected, nobody criticized his lack of manners. In fact, Deruth actually had a smile on his face as he started to nod his head.\u201cYes, it really is delicious. It is nice to see you enjoying food so much.\u201dDeruth really seemed like the only person who cared for Cale. He didn\u2019t even seem to care about Cale\u2019s lack of manners. Well, a truly caring father should probably try to fix this personality of Cale\u2026 but this Cale did not care as he was not the real Cale Henituse.\u201cYes. Please make sure you eat a lot as well, father.\u201dBasen let out another, \u2018Ho,\u2019 and Cale, who heard it this time, turned his gaze back to the dishes. The 15 year old Basen. The three years younger brother of the Cale that he possessed was difficult to handle.Unlike the trash Cale, Basen was smart, sincere, and very responsible. The people of the family were pushing for Basen to be the next head of household. Kim Rok Soo agreed with this sentiment even after turning into Cale.\u2018Rather than having a complicated life being in charge of this territory, I\u2019d rather use my position as the Count\u2019s older brother to laze around and live peacefully in a section of the territory.\u2019Cale did not try to argue with Basen. He could hear Basen\u2019s gasp of shock and knew that Basen was looking down on him, but what could he do about it?Once Basen becomes the head of the household, his personality was one that he would probably not kill Cale, but in order to not get hurt and quietly move to a small village, he needed to not get on Basen\u2019s nerves.\u2018If that\u2019s not possible, I\u2019ll just make some money beforehand and go somewhere that the war will not reach.\u2019Cale pretended not to hear Basen\u2019s gasp and continued to eat. Once the meal was over, his father, Deruth, was the first to get up. He seemed to have been satisfied with breakfast, as his face was filled with a smile.\u2018It really was delicious.\u2019If breakfast was like this every day, Cale would probably give up some sleep to come eat breakfast all the time. Deruth looked around at the family members who got up after he did, before resting his gaze on his first-born son, Cale.\u201cCale, is there anything you need?\u201dCale was confused at Deruth\u2019s sudden gesture, but he decided to honestly answer.\u201cPlease give me some money.\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll give you a lot.\u201dDeruth answered without any hesitation.This really was a well-off family.As a territory that mined for marble and grew grapes for wine, they were overflowing with money right now.\u201cGreat. Please give me as much as you can.\u201dCale could feel his two younger siblings looking at him, but there was no need for him to be embarrassed. Wasn\u2019t it better to ask for money instead of drinking and causing a ruckus?Furthermore, he needed money to proceed with his plans. That fateful encounter to get himself a strong enough power to keep himself safe. He needed some money in order to cause that fateful encounter to happen.\u201cSure. I\u2019ll give you as much as I can.\u201dCale started to smile after being satisfied with his father\u2019s response. However, he was at a loss of words after returning to his chamber and receiving the cheque from the deputy butler, Hans.The cheque that was issued through a partnership with the treasury department and the magic department made Cale\u2019s heart run wild.\u2018So much money?\u2019This family didn\u2019t seem to only have a bit of money. In fact, they seem to have a lot of money.The novel did mention that Cale received a large allowance, but it did not mention the exact amount. However, he could realistically understand how large it was based on the amount listed on the cheque.\u201810 million gallon.\u2019It is about equivalent to 10 million Korean won. If it is like this, Cale could change his plans. Cale\u2019s brain started to quickly think about his options.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading out now, young master.\u201dThe deputy butler delivered the cheque and bid goodbye, but Cale did not respond. Deputy Butler Hans just treated this as normal and headed toward the door. However, he soon stopped moving.It was because Cale had gotten up from his seat and said something to Ron.\u201cRon, let\u2019s go to the study.\u201dHans then became anxious at Cale\u2019s words. Ron was the same.\u201c...Did you say the study?\u201dCale found this odd. This sly old man\u2019s voice was shaking a bit. Was there a reason he could not go to the study?\u201cYes.\u201dHe needed to go to the study to form his plan. There were no desks or even any paper in his chamber. There were a lot of expensive looking alcohol bottles though.\u201cExcuse me, young master.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dCale looked toward the anxious looking deputy butler.\u201cThis, we have not been able to do our morning cleaning of the study just yet.\u201d\u201cIs that so? It\u2019s fine if it goes a day without cleaning.\u201d\u201cNo sir. We cannot let that happen.\u201dThe deputy butler was extremely pushy about this for some reason. He then smiled brightly and put up a single finger.\u201cPlease just wait one hour! I will put my name on the line to make sure that the study is completely clean, not like a study that has not been used in ten years, but one that was used just yesterday!\u201d\u201cSure, whatever.\u201dHe didn\u2019t mind waiting an hour.\u201cGreat. Then I will go report this to the master.\u201d\u201cNo need to do that, but go ahead if you want to do so.\u201d\u201cYes, young master. I will be off now.\u201d\u201cOkay. Sure.\u201dLike a well-trained deputy butler, Hans closed the door without making any noise and disappeared. He seemed to be in a rush. Cale knew that there were three deputy butlers vying to become the official butler. Maybe that was why Hans was so passionate about it.\u201cRon.\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201d\u201cWhy are you blanking out like that?\u201d\u201cMy apologies, young master.\u201d\u201cNo need to apologize.\u201dRon had another odd expression on his face, but Cale put the precious cheque in his inner pocket as he asked. There was so much going on that he did not even have any time to ask about today\u2019s date.\u201cWhat is today\u2019s date?\u201dThis question would seem odd coming from anybody else, but the servant Ron answered in a gentle voice.\u201cIt is the 29th day of the 3rd month in the 781st year of the Felix Calendar.\u201d\u201cMm, that is a problem.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dCale tightly clenched on the 10 million gallon in his pocket once more. The only thing he could trust was money.Yesterday, the 28th day of the 3rd month in the 781st year of the Felix Calendar. That was the day that the villagers of Harris Village, the village that the main character Choi Han went to after escaping from the Forest of Darkness, the place that Choi Han felt human affection for the first time in this world, made friends, and created a second family, were all murdered by an unknown group of assassins.Even Cale, who had read until the fifth volume, did not know the true identity of this secret organization that murdered the villagers.Some readers may be saying something like this while reading about this situation.\u2018I thought he was really strong. What was Choi Han doing while they were murdered?\u2019It is only natural to think like that.However, there is a reason this novel is called, [The Birth of a Hero], and not, [The Strength of the Hero], or, [The War of the Heroes].Birth.It was the story of a person who overcame all sorts of obstacles and carried the pains of his past as he became a hero. Love and friendship comes up along the way as he meets enemies and friends.Something that cannot be missing from a story is the, \u2018awakening.\u2019 He may have explosive talents and have lived for tens of years in the Forest of Darkness, but, through all of that, Choi Han was still an innocent and gentle person who could not kill another human being. He had no issues killing monsters, but Choi Han had never hurt another person.In order to turn someone like him into a hero, the novel had created a situation for Choi Han. In order to heal the lady who treated him like her own son, Choi Han had gone into the Forest of Darkness to find some precious medicinal herbs.He had to travel deep into the forest to find it, and, when he finally managed to find the herb and headed back towards the village, he found the corpses of the murdered villagers, the burning houses, and the assassins who were about to leave.Choi Han went berserk after seeing this and killed someone for the first time. Of course, the people he killed are the members of this secret organization, and this secret organization clashes against Choi Han every so often throughout the novel.Choi Han only returns to normal after killing all of the assassins from the secret organization, before falling into a state of despair as he is unable to gather any information from the dead bodies. He then buries the bodies of the villagers before making a promise to himself.\u2018I will kill them all. I will kill all of the people that made this happen.\u2019Choi Han realized what the sadness of death was at this moment, but his first kill starts to twist his mind. Of course, he starts to feel again and starts to become more human-like after meeting his party members later in the novel, and grows to become a true hero.\u201c...Ron.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d\u201cA cup of cold water please.\u201d\u201c... I understand.\u201dAfter Ron left and he was alone in the room, Cale covered his face with both of his hands.The problem was that the city that this twisted Choi Han arrives at after leaving Harris Village is the city called Western, located in the center of the Henituse territory.Cale who happens to run into Choi Han annoys Choi Han and ends up getting beaten up. That is when Choi Han gets his first subject/party member, the reliable chef Beacrox.\u2018... I was going to head there in advance and help him out.\u2019The best scenario to not get beaten up is no longer available. I did care more about potentially saving the people of the village, but there is nothing I can do about it at this point.Now, all that is left is to make sure I act in a way to avoid getting beaten up by the angry Choi Han, who is moving at a crazy speed to arrive at Western City by tomorrow.\u2018Avoiding the main character is not a good idea.\u2019He needed to run into Choi Han so that Ron and Beacrox run into him as well. That was the only way for the three of them to leave this place together to start their official journey. Then that left just one course of action.\u2018Have them run into each other and then get out of their way.\u2019With the best possible first impression, if possible.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cAh, thanks, Ron.\u201dCale took a sip from the cup that Ron brought over. He then started to frown.\u201cIt\u2019s not cold water?\u201d\u201cIt is lemonade.\u201dHe really is an insidious man. He knows that, just like Kim Rok Soo, the original Cale hates sour things. But he still chose to bring lemonade, which would take more work to prepare than cold water. Cale wanted to be angry at the sour taste, but he could not do so because he was afraid of that assasin old man. He could only drink the lemonade.\u201cThanks, it was wonderful.\u201d\u201cNo problem. Young master. We should be able to head to the study soon.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dRon\u2019s benign and gentle smile caused Cale to have the chills. He once again clenched onto the 10 million gallon cheque for support.Money really was the only thing you could trust.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not even prevent the admiration that was flowing out of his mouth.\u201cHa. It\u2019s so delicious.\u201dThe deputy butler Hans flinched at the words that came out of Cale\u2019s mouth. Cale was sitting alone at the table, with Hans standing next to him.Other than breakfast, Count Henituse\u2019s family tended to take care of the other meals freely. To be honest, it was mainly because they each had their own responsibilities.Nobody said that it was easy to be a noble.Especially if you were in administration or politics, you had to follow a strict schedule, dropping everything else if you received an order from someone above you.Count Deruth had responsibilities as the lord of the region, making it difficult to share other meals together, while Cale\u2019s younger siblings timed their meals based on their studies. The Countess was busy interacting with the wives of the influential households in the region, as well as other tasks.\u2018Now that I think about it.\u2019Cale put the fork down after suddenly remembering something. Hans started to get nervous, thinking to himself that this was the normal Cale. He was worried because he did not know when that fork may fly toward his face. Cale did not care whether Hans was nervous or not as he got lost in his own thoughts.\u2018There are a lot of experts hiding as artists or craftsmen.\u2019The Roan Kingdom was pretty advanced in construction and the arts, especially sculpting. It was because there was a lot of marble in the Roan Kingdom. Thanks to that, the Henituse region became the fifth best marble mining region, bringing in a lot of money.Furthermore, a mountain range took up most of Count Henituse\u2019s region. Even though it was located in the northwest, the mountains were extremely fertile, allowing the residents to grow grapes in between the mountains for wine. Although there was not a large quantity of wine from these fields, they were still treated as one of the best wines in the entire continent.However, Cale\u2019s mind was filled more about the, \u2018strong individuals,\u2019 and not these facts. He had even missed lunch as he sat in the study thinking about that all day.\u2018Why are there so many experts on this stupid land? This isn\u2019t the murim.\u2019There were so many hermit experts here like in the murim. That was why Cale came to a conclusion.Do not mess with just anybody.An average looking chef could be a poison expert, and the person working in the repair shop could be someone who viciously killed people with his wires. This was that type of land.\u201cSigh.\u201dA deep sigh came out of Cale\u2019s mouth. He had just completed his plan to prevent himself from dying and living peacefully.\u201cYoung master.\u201dCale, who wanted to let out another sigh, turned his gaze to the source of the cautious voice. It was the deputy butler Hans.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShould I get them to make something else?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHans held back his sigh after seeing Cale frowning and opening his eyes widely. He was thinking that Cale would now flip the table. Hans didn\u2019t know why the Count would assign him to take care of Cale, but held back his rising despair as he waited for Cale\u2019s response.And Cale did respond.\u201cWhy would you remake something this delicious?\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201dCale picked his fork back up and sliced the meat. Dinner was even fancier than breakfast. It was not delicious because he had never had something like this when he was still Kim Rok Soo, but because it was an extravagant taste, even for the original Cale.Kim Rok Soo didn\u2019t know how Cale grew up, but the original Cale had issues with anything that was not fancy. He liked that fact quite a bit. Everybody knew that was the case and only brought the best of the best.Cale put a piece of the well-cooked, but still juicy, piece of steak in his mouth as he asked Hans. His attitude was one that said he did not care about etiquettes at all.\u201cHans, who made this meal?\u201d\u201cAh, it was second chef Beacrox.\u201d\u2026Cale suddenly lost his appetite.Beacrox. He was clean cut and was the son of the servant Ron. However, unlike his father, he specialized in the way of the sword and not assassinations. Beacrox was also obsessed with cleanliness and sharpened his spotless blade every day, using that same sword to slice the heads of his enemies off their bodies.\u2018\u2026He also specializes in torture.\u2019That kind of guy ends up admiring Choi Han\u2019s sword skill and chooses to follow him. His father Ron makes a deal with Choi Han to help him, and chooses to leave with the two of them for the sake of his son. Although he may not look like it, Ron cherishes his son quite a bit.Cale looked down at the medium rare steak that was still slightly pink on the inside and gulped a few times.\u2018I can\u2019t allow my blood to shed like this steak.\u2019He turned his gaze toward Hans who was still looking at him before cutting another piece of steak and putting it in his mouth.\u201cIt is delicious. He is Ron\u2019s son, right? I did not know he was such a talented chef.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will deliver your message to chef Beacrox. I\u2019m sure he will be very happy to know that young master Cale complimented his cooking.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Let him know that I truly enjoyed this delicious meal.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dHans was looking at Cale with a stiff expression, but Cale had made up his mind. He was not going to mess with Beacrox and would work to make a good impression.Cale enjoyed the meal once again with a relaxed heart. Everything will be settled once he made Beacrox run into Choi Han and leave the region. Cale had already made what he thought to be a pretty good plan to make that happen.Just like during breakfast, Cale completely emptied the dishes. He had a satisfied smile on his face as he got up and looked toward Hans.\u201cHans, why did you suddenly end up being assigned to me?\u201dHans had mentioned before dinner that his father, Deruth, had sent him to personally handle Cale\u2019s needs. Although Cale did not know about the situation in Count Henituse\u2019s family once Choi Han leaves, Hans was extremely skilled and probably had the best chance of all the deputy butlers in becoming the official butler.Hans slightly bowed his head and answered the question.\u201cThe Count-nim was concerned after hearing that young master had missed a meal while working in the study and ordered me to make sure that the young master makes sure to eat every meal. As a result, I will be overseeing just the meal-related duties for the young master.\u201dTo be specific, Hans was responsible for the meals.\u201cIs that so? My father did something he didn\u2019t need to do. I would eat properly on my own. But I guess I would have not realized it was time for dinner if Hans did not come tell me.\u201dCale was busy writing down all the fateful encounters in the first five volumes of the novel in Korean. After leaving the dining room, Cale smiled toward Hans.\u201cHans, take good care of me.\u201d\u201cAh, of course. Please take good care of me as well. I will do my best.\u201dHans stumbled a bit as he answered, but Cale just let it be. Cale saw Ron standing there as soon as he opened the door and started to frown.\u201cRon, didn\u2019t I tell you to go eat?\u201dCale told him to go away because he did not want to see this old man\u2019s face, but he would not leave. He just roamed around Cale like a fly. Ron had been waiting outside the door when he was in the study, but even that got on Cale\u2019s nerves.\u201cYoung master, it is my duty to take care of you.\u201dCale clicked his tongue after seeing Ron smiling at him. He then threw a bit of a tantrum.\u201cEnough. I don\u2019t need it so go eat. Why don\u2019t you go eat even when I tell you to go eat? Don\u2019t follow me. You know my temper if you do, right?\u201dCale threatened Ron with his gaze to reinforce that he did not want Ron to follow as he headed back to the study. When he peeked back, Ron was standing there with a stiff expression while Hans was looking towards him with shock.\u2018Should I not have thrown a tantrum?\u2019Cale was scared of the assassin old man\u2019s stiff expression and turned his head back around before speeding back to the study.The desk was completely empty.The document that he had been working so hard on to write in Korean was already burnt in the fire. Cale had done so himself. There was nobody here who knew Korean, but he had to be careful. He had also told all the servants not to enter the study without his permission as well.\u2018I remember everything anyways.\u2019Kim Rok Soo had always been good at remembering things he enjoyed. Comic books, novels, movies, no matter what it was, as long as he enjoyed it, he was able to remember the names and appearances of the characters. Of course, if he didn\u2019t like something, he would not remember anything about it at all.Cale leaned his back onto the chair and thought about what he needed to do in the future.\u2018First, I need to see Choi Han tomorrow and do that.\u2019The corners of his lips started to slowly rise.\u2018I need to pick up a shield.\u2019To live long without dying. He had no intentions of fighting.In order to achieve that goal, the first step was raising his defenses. Second was finding a recovery method. Third was being faster than anybody else. Fourth was a strength that does not hurt him but can kill others.Of course, the most important thing was to avoid the battlefield or anywhere where there may be bloodshed.Cale thought about these so called plans of his as he slowly closed his eyes with satisfaction. He was thinking about it even as he fell asleep.\u2018At least, I will not be beaten up even when the time comes for it in the novel.\u2019The Indestructible Shield. Cale was thinking about this first shapeless strength he was going to get as he fell asleep. The corners of his lips that had gone up did not seem like they would ever come down.Fateful encounters did not have an owner. It was a first come first serve type of deal.The important day. What did he need to do in order to calm his nerves and be successful? Cale thought the first step was to have a hearty breakfast.He felt like the only thing he did after coming to this world was eating, but he was going to enjoy the meal since he will be busy for a while starting tomorrow.\u201cMm, ahem. I heard you fell asleep in the study last night.\u201d\u201cIt somehow ended up that way.\u201dHe casually answered his father\u2019s question and continued to focus on the food. The fact that he did not even look at his father probably seemed rude, but it was fine since he was known for being the trash.Cale finished eating first and stood up. The screeching noise of the chair made everyone focus on him.\u201cI will head out first.\u201dIt was not proper etiquette, but Cale\u2019s father Deruth just seemed to like his son no matter what. He looked back and forth at Cale and the empty plates before starting to smile.\u201cSure. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dCale needed to quickly leave because he had a lot of things to do today. But Deruth held him back for a second.\u201cYou don\u2019t need any allowance today?\u201d\u201c\u2026I do need some.\u201dThis really was a family with a lot of money. Cale held back his smile after hearing that his father will send him the allowance through Hans and left without even saying thank you. He did make eye contact with his brother, Basen, for a moment, but Cale just ignored it and headed toward the dining room door.He saw that Ron was following him and shooed him away.\u201cRon. I\u2019m going out. Don\u2019t look for me.\u201dDon\u2019t look for me. That was Cale\u2019s code for letting Ron know that he was leaving the estate that was located near the rear of the city to go drinking. Whenever he did this, Ron just smiled and told him to have a safe trip.\u201cWill you not go to the study today?\u201dBut for some reason, Ron asked a rare question today. Cale started to frown.\u201cRon, I don\u2019t think that is something you need to be curious about.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand, young master. I will be waiting for you.\u201dCale\u2019s forehead started to show even more wrinkles after hearing that Ron will be waiting for him.\u201cDon\u2019t wait for me.\u201dCale flicked his finger to beckon one of the servants standing at the entrance of the residence over and walked out with him. Cale still seemed angry, so that servant did not say anything as he followed behind Cale.Once he exited the residence, he could see the garden and the gate of the exit farther away. It was only then that Cale let out a sigh and peeked backwards. He could see Ron\u2019s stiff expression through the closing door.\u2018I\u2019m glad I was able to shake him off.\u2019He was glad that Ron did not follow him. However, Cale was afraid of that stiff expression. He was an assassin after all. Cale decided that he will treat Ron better and not make him angry starting the next interaction as he exited the estate. Of course, he was on a carriage.He arrived at his destination a little bit later.\u201cYoung master. Is this the right place?\u201dThe driver cautiously asked as he opened the door. He then peeked toward the shop in front of him. The driver\u2019s face was clearly filled with confusion.\u201cYes. This is it.\u201dCale, who was wearing clothes that would be fancy to others but was the simplest thing in his closet, walked out of the carriage. Nobody was around them, as they had moved away as soon as they saw the carriage with the count\u2019s crest on it.[The Fragrance of Tea with Poetry]It was a tea shop that allowed you to read poems while drinking tea. This clean three story building looked to be pretty expensive. It was true that the owner of the shop was very wealthy. In fact, as the bastard son of a concubine of a large merchant guild, he was even wealthier than Cale. The only thing was that he was living here while hiding that identity.\u2018If I recall correctly, the owner goes to the capital around volume 3 to meet Choi Han there. It is there that he claims that, he may be a bastard son of a concubine of the merchant guild, but that he will become the owner of the merchant guild.\u2019The man who shouts and swears to Choi Han that he will become the owner of the merchant guild. Cale only read the first five volumes, and thus did not know if the man ever ended up becoming the owner of that merchant guild, but since he was one of the main character\u2019s partners, he probably will succeed.Cale looked toward the driver who was sweating like a hog and gave an order.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cAre you going to make me say the same thing twice?\u201d\u201cNo, that, do I not need to wait for you, young master?\u201dCale casually answered as he opened the door to the tea shop.\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be here for a while.\u201dGulp. He could hear the driver\u2019s gulp behind him, but a much clearer and pleasurable noise filled Cale\u2019s ears. Clang. A quiet but clear bell sound announced Cale\u2019s entrance into the tea shop.Cale stood at the entrance and looked around the tea shop. It was still early, and there were not many people there. Cale could see that all of them were shocked to see him there.Well, the novel did say there was nobody in this region who did not know about Cale. He was public enemy number one for the merchants because he had a tendency to break everything in their shops.\u201cWelcome.\u201dHowever, the owner of this shop warmly welcomed Cale in. Cale looked toward the baby pig-like man who welcomed him in from the counter.\u2018He must be the owner.\u2019The wealthy bastard, Billos. His round face and full body definitely looked like a baby pig like the novel described. His charm was his extremely bright smile.\u2018He looks like a piggy bank.\u2019Cale took out a gold coin and put it on the counter as he ordered.\u201cI plan on staying on the third floor all day today.\u201dBillos stared at Cale with a smile on his face. Cale pretended not to notice as he pointed to the bookshelf.\u201cAny tea that is not bitter. Do you have novels here too or just poems?\u201dClang. The sound of someone putting their teacup down rang through the shop. Cale just thought of it as someone putting the teacup down hard and looked toward Billos. He prefered novels to poems.\u201cOf course. We have a lot of novels as well, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cReally? Then send up the most interesting book and a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dCale\u2019s gold coin fell onto Billos\u2019s chubby hands. Cale turned away as Billos tried to give him change.\u201cI\u2019ll drink more tea later so just keep it.\u201d\u201c\u2026But it is still too much, young master.\u201dA gold coin was worth 1 million gallon. Having that coin, that was worth 1 million Korean won, Cale did something that he had always wanted to try.\u201cI have a lot of money. Consider it as your tip.\u201dTalking about how rich you are. Who cares if Billos actually has more money than he does? He also knew about many fateful encounters that will earn him a lot of money. Cale tried to look cool as he pointed toward the tables on the first floor with his chin.\u201cWell, if it is too much, you can treat everyone here to a cup of tea on me.\u201dGolden Bell. He wanted to do something like this once. After he told his father that he needed allowance, he received three gold coins which were worth a total of 3 million gallon.\u201cYoung master, still\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, enough. Just bring my tea.\u201dIt really was good to be the trash. Cale did not care about being respectful as he headed up to the third floor. He could hear whispers coming from behind him, but he did not need to care because there were already enough rumors about him, the trash of the Count\u2019s family.\u201cJust like I thought.\u201dThere was nobody else on the third floor right now because it was early in the morning. Cale took a seat in the innermost corner of the third floor. He then looked out the window.\u2018This is the right spot.\u2019The spot where you could best see the Northern Gate of Western City. Cale planned to watch Choi Han from this location today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: They Met (2)\u2018He gets chased away from the gate early in the morning.\u2019Choi Han headed in the direction he remembered hearing about from the villagers after he finished burying all of his beloved villagers. He was heading toward Western City.Choi Han had been transported to this world when he was a freshman in high school, but he had lived here for tens of years already. Of course, the fact that most of that life was spent trying to survive in the Forest of Darkness made him mature in a slightly twisted way, and, as such, he was more rational than anybody would expect after such an incident.\u2018I need to go report this to the lord at the castle.\u2019Harris Village may have been a remote village, but it was still under Count Henituse\u2019s jurisdiction. That was why Choi Han headed to Western City, hoping to at least prepare a small funeral for the villagers.He was also planning on looking for information regarding the assassins he had killed when he had lost his calm, as he was unable to ask them any questions. However, sending the dead off properly came before revenge.\u2018If you think about it, he really is an affectionate person.\u2019But losing all of the first people who showed him love after tens of years in the Forest of Darkness at once made it impossible for Choi Han\u2019s mind to not become twisted. In the novel, that was when Cale messes with Choi Han and touches a nerve. He remembered what the Cale in the novel said to Choi Han.[\u201cWhy should my father care whether or not some useless villagers are dead? This cup of alcohol in my hand is worth more than all of your useless lives combined.\u201d]Choi Han starts to laugh at Cale\u2019s words as he asks back.[\u201cWhat an interesting thought. I am very curious to know whether you will change your mind or not.\u201d][\u2018Shall we test it out?\u2019]That test was beating Cale to a pulp so that he was almost dead. The amazing thing was that Cale never changed his mind even after he was beaten to a pulp.\u201cAh, I\u2019m getting the chills.\u201dCale started to rub his arm after seeing the goosebumps that were developing. He quickly took a sip of the tea that Billos had brought for him. He then looked out the window once again, only to get the chills right back.\u2018It\u2019s that punk.\u2019The moment the gates opened for the morning, a young man wearing clothes with black marks everywhere, such that it made it seem like the clothes were burnt in multiple places, approached the gate. It was Choi Han.Cale did not get up from his seat as he observed Choi Han.His speed was admirable, as he ran like a lunatic through a distance that would normally take a carriage a week to travel, but, as a result, he looked like a mess. Of course, the events in the village were responsible for a bit of his messy look as well.The guard blocked Choi Han\u2019s path as he walked in with his head down, looking completely exhausted. Cale didn\u2019t know what they were saying, but he could see Choi Han shake his head at the guard\u2019s question.\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking if he has any identification.\u2019The guards of Western City were generally gentle, but they were strict when it came to the rules. They replicated their liege, Count Deruth\u2019s personality.\u201cThey kicked him out.\u201dAs expected, Choi Han walked back out of the gate. He did not even throw a fit. After continuously running for a day, his slightly recovered conscience told him not to kill an innocent man.\u2018Choi Han will now wait until night time before he stealthily jumps over the city wall to enter.\u2019He then runs into Cale who was busy drinking away.Screech. Since Cale was alone, the sound of the chair being pushed as he stood up sounded pretty loud. He went downstairs and informed Billos who was at the counter.\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon. Don\u2019t clear my spot.\u201d\u201cYes, young master. I look forward to your return.\u201dCale ignored the smile on Billos\u2019s chubby face as he walked out of the tea shop.\u201cHe didn\u2019t break anything!\u201dCale could hear someone\u2019s voice coming from inside the shop, but he did not care. He needed to set the foundation to earn that Indestructible Shield today.The Indestructible Shield.It is not talking about a physical item. The best comparison might be a mage\u2019s mana shield. Something that does not actually have a physical form. However, it was very different from a mana shield, as it was closer to superpower than magic.The funny thing was that the human who created the power, but ended up dying, was someone who served a god but ended up being excommunicated.\u2018All sorts of weird things are in this novel.\u2019As with the history of any fantasy world, this world also had its ancient history. During that ancient time, neither magic nor weaponry was developed.Instead, it was a society where your own innate talent or talents gathered from supernatural occurrences played a pivotal role. The strongest powers in that society were superpowers, divine powers, and natural forces. It was a very primitive time.Some of those powers have lasted all the way until now, staying hidden in certain locations or items. It was possible to take those powers for yourself if you meet the right conditions.Ancient powers.The heroes would find these powers, however, these powers were all supporting powers, not strong enough to be used as a hero\u2019s mainstay.These were the powers that Cale was looking to find.\u2018Everything but the divine powers.\u2019Whether it be god or angels or devils, Cale did not want to get involved with any of them.That was why Cale was looking for the powers that people naturally developed or came from nature.\u2018That is the way to make sure I don\u2019t need to put in any effort.\u2019Those were the types of powers he was looking for. Something like sword art or magic would require him to put in effort to practice. He didn\u2019t want to do something like that.Unlike other books, the ancient civilization in the novel, [The Birth of a Hero], was not that strong.As civilization developed, the magic and summoning skills that were developed outshined the natural powers left behind by the ancient civilization. Superpowers were the same way. Most subtle superpowers would be blown away by a single hit from the, \u2018Aura,\u2019 that was used in present day.It wasn\u2019t like the heroes just used these powers sparingly for no reason.\u2018And my goal is to collect these subtle superpowers to become decently strong.\u2019It was a satisfying goal. Especially because he also knew the ancient power that could strengthen these subtle super powers.In order to take the first step in his plan, Cale started to look for the ancient power that was hidden in Western City. He knew the requirement to earn that power.\u201cYoun, young master. Welcome.\u201dCale just nodded his head at the baker, who bowed so low that it looked like his head might touch the ground, to respond. Gasp. He could hear the baker gasping, but Cale pretended not to hear it. He felt bad about how his trash reputation was making this baker so fearful.\u201cGive me some bread.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale pointed at all of the bread in the bakery and sternly responded.\u201cEverything from here to there.\u201dClang. The gold coin that Cale took out started to spin on the counter.\u201cPack it all up.\u201dThe baker seemed to be frozen in place as Cale continued to speak.\u201cTwo or three more gold coins should be enough for a week\u2019s worth of bread, right?\u201dThe baker\u2019s gaze, which had been on the gold coin, moved to Cale. It was too much money to pay for the bread. Cale just stoically responded to the baker\u2019s shaking eyes.\u201cI can go somewhere else if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cNo, it is nothing like that! Young master! I will pack it as fast as possible!\u201dThe baker was extremely respectful for a different reason than before as he moved around quickly. After a few minutes, Cale left the bakery with a bag full of bread over his shoulder.Even though it was just bread, it weighed quite a bit. The weight made Cale start to frown, and he ignored the baker who was watching him leave as he stepped into the street.Cale leisurely walked down the street, noticing that anybody who made eye contact with him would quickly turn and walk away. The majority of the people even ran away to avoid eye contact with him.\u2018It really is different than Korea. It is truly a fantasy world.\u2019Cale looked around as he wandered around this market that gave off the typical fantasy feel.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cMmph.\u201dAny time he made eye contact with a merchant, they became shocked and avoided his gaze. Tsk tsk. Cale really must have lived up to his title of trash in the past. Cale was talking shit about himself as he walked past the market and toward the western part of Western City.The slum is located to the west. No matter how wealthy a territory may be, there are always going to be poor people. In a situation like this, most people would probably expect something along these lines to happen.\u2018Ah, it is a fateful encounter that you can earn by sharing food with the poor.\u2019Unfortunately, that was not the case.Cale could feel people peeking at him as soon as he entered the slums. This was the place where both the idlest and the most vicious people lived together.Although the poor may not know the face of their liege, the count, they knew Cale\u2019s face. These people who had nothing needed to pay even closer attention to the type of person that would cause a ruckus in the market, pub, plaza, well, you name it, and Cale has probably caused a ruckus there too.\u201cTsk.\u201dEven though they knew all these stories about Cale, they couldn\u2019t resist the sweet smell of the bread in Cale\u2019s bag. Cale just ignored all these gazes as he continued to walk.The tip of his expensive leather shoe started to become dirty from the dirty water. An unknown stench also filled Cale\u2019s nose, making him naturally start to frown.This made him start to walk even faster. The slums were on one side of a small hill and constituted of old houses. Cale was heading toward the top of that hill. As he got closer, the gazes and steps of the people following him started to lessen as well. Cale\u2019s sharp glare probably played a role in this as well.\u2018It\u2019s better here.\u2019After being freed from the stench, Cale stood at the top of the hill and turned around to look down at Western City. Of course, this hill was not as high as the count\u2019s estate. There was no way that they would allow the lord of the territory to live somewhere that was lower than that slums.Cale came back to his senses as he headed toward a tree that was fenced off in all directions. The fence, that was made of planks the width of Cale\u2019s body, had an entrance that had rotted. It was easily broken once Cale pushed at the fence.This large tree seemed to have lasted for hundreds of years. Trees in the slums were usually chopped into firewood or had its layers peeled off to make it useless, but this tree was not like that.The reason was simple. The reason could be heard in Kale\u2019s ear. These two were the only two who had followed him until the end from the slums.\u201cYou can\u2019t approach that t-tree!\u201dCale ignored that warning. He heard another worried voice as well.\u201cYou can\u2019t go there! It\u2019s a man-eating tree!\u201dA man-eating tree. Anyone who hung themselves on this tree became mummies overnight. Furthermore, any blood that lands on this tree instantly disappeared.Finally, there was only dirt around this tree. Grass, and even weeds, were nowhere to be found.This was the tree that Cale was looking for.A long time ago, during ancient times, there was a person who loved food so much that his gluttony in the place of worship got him kicked out. That person ended up starving to death.This tree is said to have grown on top of his body, and that person\u2019s grudge and strength were both in this tree. The Indestructible Shield that Cale was looking for was here.How primitive, mysterious and strange was this! The majority of the ancient powers were mysterious like this.Cale took a bread out of the bag and carefully observed a hole that was the size of an adult\u2019s head. He needed to first send away the owner of that voice before starting his work. However, before Cale could even say anything, the voice was even louder this time as they could no longer see Cale from outside the fence because he crouched down. The voice was shaking quite a bit.\u201cYou\u2019re going to die! Don\u2019t do it!\u201dCale pressed his temples with his fingers.\u201cSigh.\u201dThe number of people following him decreased the closer he got to the man-eating tree at the top of the hill, however, the owner of that voice continued to follow him.\u2018There are always nosy punks no matter where you go.\u2019Cale frowned as he turned his head around. When he did, he noticed a girl who seemed to be around 10 years old, holding her younger brother\u2019s hand while looking at him. Her eyes were full of concern.Seeing that Cale was frowning and staring at her, the young girl stumbled on her words and started to mumble.\u201cIt\u2019s a man-eating tree. You\u2019re going to d, die.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201dCale took two breads out of the bag and threw it toward the little girl. It didn\u2019t matter if it rolled on the ground because they were all individually wrapped.\u201cTake that and get lost.\u201dThe young boy instantly grabbed the bread, but the young girl was still hesitating. In the end, Cale needed to use his identity. He stood up and pushed his head outside of the fence.\u201cYou two don\u2019t know about Cale the trash?\u201dThe young girl\u2019s face turned pale. Her younger brother just looked toward Cale before picking up the other bread for his sister and started to tug on her arm.\u201cNoona.\u201d\u201cUh huh.\u201dThe young girl looked back and forth at the tree and Cale even as she was being pulled.\u201cYou can\u2019t die.\u201dCale clicked his tongue at the young girl who continued to say that, before making sure nobody else was around as he sat down underneath the tree. Nobody would be able to see what he was doing unless they came right up to the fence.\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201dHe started by taking a loaf of bread out of the bag and putting it into that hole. His hand soon disappeared into the darkness underneath the tree, and Cale could feel a cold sensation as the bread in his hand disappeared.He felt like his whole hand might be sucked in, and quickly took it out.The darkness in the hole underneath the tree was still the same.\u201cIf you die with a grudge, you have to resolve that grudge.\u201dThis man-eating tree wasn\u2019t actually a man-eating tree. It was a tree that would eat anything. It was the side effect of the power that was left behind by the person who starved to death. But for such a thing to be related to an ancient strength\u2026it was comical, but made it seem more realistic.\u2018I remember it said I need to feed it until the darkness disappears.\u2019The darkness in the hole underneath the tree was not the result of shade. It was darkness formed by the grudge.This could not be done with other people. One person had to continue to provide a large amount of food until the darkness disappeared. Once the darkness finally disappears, the light that was hiding underneath would appear.Once he eats that light, the, \u2018Indestructible Shield,\u2019 will become Cale\u2019s.\u201cEat all you want.\u201dCale put the opening of the bag into the hole and emptied all of the bread into it. In a normal situation, that small hole should have become filled with bread, however, only the darkness continued to remain once Cale removed the bag.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll need about ten more large bags.\u201dThe darkness in the hole was slightly fainter than before.Ten bags. Only someone like Cale, with 3 million gallons as allowance, could casually say such a thing.Rumble-An odd cry seemed to resonate from the tree. It seemed to be saying that it was hungry and asking for more food. Cale felt like the darkness might suddenly reach out and grab him.\u201c\u2026It is a bit scary.\u201dCale quickly got up. He felt like he should not be here for a long time.\u201cJust what can a stupid grudge do?\u201dGluttony was a scary thing.\u201cI\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201dCale said goodbye to the rumbling tree as if it was a person and exited the fenced area. Cale noticed the siblings eating the bread as soon as he entered the slums.For someone who was claiming that he should not go there because it was a man-eating tree, they seemed to be enjoying the breads. They must be liking the flavor, because both of them seemed very happy.\u201cMy my.\u201dCale snorted at the siblings before ignoring their gazes. However, their gazes were not on him, but on the bag that was filled with bread earlier but was now empty. They were probably curious.But what could they do? They couldn\u2019t do anything.These children were probably too scared to even go near the man-eating tree. However, it is always good to be on the safe side. It would be bad if they went up to the tree and put their head into the hole and got eaten.[The children of the slums have no fear. It was because they treasured a single grain of rice more than a blade coming their way. Death is always around them, so they do not fear death. They fear being hungry more than death.]It was something that was written in [The Birth of a Hero].That was why Cale decided to speak to the pair of siblings.\u201cIf you want to eat bread again tomorrow, don\u2019t say a thing.\u201dThe two siblings did not say anything. They were immediately following Cale\u2019s order. The young girl, who seemed hesitant earlier, put her hand on her brother\u2019s mouth and pretended to not see Cale. Cale smiled and thought that she was pretty smart, as he quickly left the slums.The people in the slums who knew Cale had gone to the top of the hill were looking at him wondering what crazy thing he was doing now, but Cale liked that kind of gaze.The people outside the slums looked at Cale weirdly as well, but Cale didn\u2019t care about these gazes.\u201cAh, young master. You are back.\u201dOnce Cale returned to the tea shop, Billos greeted him pretty happily.\u201cYes. Bring me a new cup of tea. A refreshing one this time.\u201dCale headed back to his seat on the third floor. It should have been pretty busy at this time, but there was nobody else on the third floor. They were all avoiding the trash of the Count\u2019s family. That was why Cale could relax.\u201cHere is your tea, young master. I also brought up some desserts.\u201d\u201cAh, great. Thanks.\u201dCale only continued to look toward the city gate as he took a sip of the tea. Billos observed Cale\u2019s face with an odd expression before he quietly left the third floor. It was weird to hear Cale thanking someone.Cale continued to order tea and desserts as he looked outside the window until the sky slowly turned orange and the sun set. He only got up when night arrived and it was dark outside.It was now time to go interact with the dangerous dude who will come from outside the wall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Which means, one jab should be okay.\u201cAre you heading out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere were not many people left in the tea shop.It was past 9pm. This was the time when there were more people in the bars than tea shops. Since this was the time that the people mining in the pits went to drink, the bar should be full of people.\u201cI look forward to your next visit, young master.\u201dCale nodded his head at Billos\u2019s statement.\u201cThe tea was great.\u201dCale shared his observations with Billos.\u201cAnd the book was good even though I only got through half of it. I especially liked the main character whose abilities are appreciated and the way he grows.\u201dIn that instant, the corner of Billos\u2019s eyebrows frowned for a moment before returning to normal. His eyes were cloudy as he observed Cale.However, Cale did not notice, as he was trying to remember the contents of the book. He was too worried about Choi Han that he did not pay too much attention to it.However, it was still fun to read while having this sense of urgency in his heart.It might be an auto-setting from possessing the original Cale\u2019s body, but Cale was able to understand the language of this world, and had no issues reading and enjoying the book. A smile formed on Cale\u2019s face as he continued to speak to Billos, who was standing there with a blank expression on his face.\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone else read that book,so that I can read it whenever I come.\u201dThis truly was the immature son of the Count, who was trying to monopolize someone else\u2019s property. Billos, the bastard son of a wealthy merchant guild might not like it, but what could he do? Cale was the son of the Count.\u201cYes! I will reserve this book only for young master Cale!\u201dHowever, Billos\u2019s response was different from what Cale expected. Billos smiled brightly as he urged Cale to come back soon.\u201cPlease come again soon. I will be waiting for you.\u201d\u201cSure, whatever.\u201dCale didn\u2019t want to go, but had to leave to go meet Choi Han. Ring. The bell rang once more and it suddenly felt like the tea shop became louder once Cale left.However, it was even louder outside the tea shop than it was inside. Even though this territory was far from the capital, the fact that a lot of artists resided here and that they had a special product made it a popular location. These individuals, as well as the miners who were looking to relax after a long day in the mines, all were out late to drink.Cale walked that street alone.\u2018If you think about it, he really is a unique person.\u2019Normally in fantasies or martial arts novels, the trash of the family tend to hang out with the gangsters or bad crowds. They drink, fool around with women, and cause a ruckus on the streets or stores.The funny thing was that Cale Henituse actually hated gangsters and scammers. In fact, he despised them.\u2018He thought that they were all scumbags.\u2019The worst of all scumbags. It was better to at least be the citizens who worked hard even though there was no hopes for a better future.That was why he never beat people up when he was drunk but had no issues throwing things at the gangsters he saw. Well, attempted to throw things, since his aim when drunk was terrible.Maybe that was the reason.\u2018Aigoo, young master, you\u2019re here?\u201dThe owner of the bar was extremely afraid of Cale. It was because of that one day when Cale broke pretty much everything around where he was sitting to drink. In fact, Cale was probably number one on the blacklist for Western City bars.He did not respond to the owner\u2019s greeting and just threw a gold coin at him.\u201cBring a bottle of my usual. Oh, and roasted chicken breast. Don\u2019t put salt on it.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Y, you don\u2019t want to find a seat first?\u201dCale started to frown. The owner immediately waved his hands and bowed his head.\u201cImmediately! I will bring it immediately!\u201dThe owner was moving quickly, but it looked like he was smiling. It was because it looked like Cale was not planning on sitting down. Cale looked around the bar that became quiet once he walked in. Everyone was avoiding his gaze and turned their heads. It was like they were wondering why he had to choose this bar of all bars in the city. The gangsters and scammers in the bar were all extremely nervous right now.\u201cTsk.\u201dThe sound of Cale clicking his tongue could be heard through the silence in the bar.\u201cYoung master, here is the bottle you requested.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dCale grabbed the bottle and bag of chicken. It was the alcohol he drank often. It was probably the most expensive alcohol in this bar. He accepted the bottle with no regret and left the bar.Cale immediately opened the bottle and drank about half of it as soon as he stepped out of the bar.\u201cOh.\u201dThe alcohol tasted pretty good. Since Cale had a high tolerance to alcohol, it did not affect him at all to drink half of the bottle at once. He just flushed easily, making people think he was a lightweight.Cale quickly walked along with the bottle in his hand.He walked back past the tea shop he stayed in all day until he saw the guards stiffen up after seeing him. Seeing them acting like that made him want to go out of the gate, but unfortunately, that was not his destination.\u201cAh, I\u2019m starting to get hot.\u201dCale felt himself heating up as he continued to drink. He walked a bit further until he reached the city wall not too far away. The tall city wall that started at the gate seemed to defend against any potential intruders.\u2018Well it depends on the person.\u2019Cale recalled the information from the book.\u2018Approximately 100 steps from the city gate.\u2019That was the location where Choi Han jumped over the city wall. Cale clenched the bottle in his hand as he quickly ran toward the location. There were not many people on the streets because it was the residential area.Cale took a deep breath once he arrived at the calculated location.Exactly 100 steps away from the city gate. It was a corner of the residential area so there wasn\u2019t any other light other than the torch the guards put on top of the wall, as well as the lights coming out of the residential windows.But that was enough light. Cale slowly approached his destination after letting his eyes adjust to the dark.\u2018Just as I expected.\u2019He could see something curled up underneath the city wall. Actually, there were multiple things.Delicate looking things that were shaking because of the cold. Cale continued to walk toward the location. He could hear the voices of the curled up lifeforms.Meow Meeeeeow.Two cats were meowing as they lay curled up underneath the city wall. Cale started to smile.\u2018It\u2019s right here.\u2019He found the right spot. The moment Choi Han jumps over the wall, a baby kitten is body slammed by the alpha cat of the neighborhood and gets sent tumbling to the city wall. Choi Han quickly twists his body to avoid landing on the kitten. This was a world where coincidences played a big role.\u2018He really is a good guy.\u2019Choi Han twists his ankle after unexpectedly twisting his body to avoid hurting the kitten. He had run like crazy to reach Western City after killing tens of people for the first time and burying the corpses of the villagers. His body had reached its limit making him unable to land properly after making such a movement.Meeeeow Meeeeeeow.Cale gazed at the kitten that was curled up and shaking, as well as the other kitten that seemed to be its sibling licking the shaking kitten. He then turned his gaze.He turned to look at one of the alleys that was close to where was standing. He could see him.\u2018I found him.\u2019The man who was wincing in pain while looking like one of the homeless that lived in the slums. Cale could see the shaggy black hair and the old and burnt clothes.According to the novel, Cale and Choi Han would meet tomorrow. Tonight was the night Cale got drunk and got the scar on his side. Things were already different than in the novel, even though it was just minor details.Cale stood up as he had crouched down to look at the kittens. Choi Han must have felt his gaze from a few moments ago, as Choi Han slowly raised his head and his eyes focused on Cale through his shaggy black hair.\u2018Damn it, I\u2019m shaking.\u2019Cale could hear his heart going crazy.Although it was too dark to see clearly, Choi Han\u2019s eyes that Cale could see through his hair were extremely cold.Cale thought that it was a good idea that he chose to drink.Cale congratulated himself for making such a smart decision and calmed himself down as much as possible. Jab. He needed to launch a jab and leave a good first impression.Cale took a deep breath as he started to speak to Choi Han who was staring at him.\u201cYou look like you are hungry.\u201dTsk tsk. Cale clicked his tongue and took the chicken breast out of the bag. Then with an extremely gentle movement, Cale offered the roasted chicken breast not to Choi Han, but to the kittens.\u201cYou poor things. Go ahead and eat it.\u201dCale didn\u2019t know that the kittens would be this small. He hope that they could still eat the chicken breast. Tsk. He clicked his tongue as he ripped the chicken breast into pieces so that the kittens could eat it better.He was wondering what the hell he was doing crouching here feeding these kittens.To be honest, Cale did not like cats. However, Choi Han treasured small animals.Grrooooowl. Groooooowl.The injured kitten must have understood Cale\u2019s dislike for cats, as it showed its teeth and started to growl, but Cale started to pet the kitten\u2019s silver fur as he looked into its golden eyes. The kitten must not have liked it, as it did its best to avoid Cale\u2019s hand.\u201cYou poor things. Eat this and get better soon.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even look at Choi Han when he said that, however, he was thinking that Choi Han was definitely looking at him.\u201cDo you have somewhere to go?\u201dHe did not hear a response. However, Cale continued to speak. The guards would soon come to patrol this area, and he needed to make a move before Choi Han started to limp away to avoid the guards.\u201cOr a place to stay?\u201dCale petted the growling silver furred kitten with golden eyes and pushed away the red kitten that was trying to attack him as he asked. The red kitten kept trying to hit Cale for some reason. It\u2019s golden eyes, that matched its sibling\u2019s eyes, shined brightly even in the darkness.But Cale needed to focus on Choi Han.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201dThere still was no response. Cale had expected this.Choi Han was probably observing him right now, but he also probably wanted to rest.Both his body and mind had reached their limit. In addition, he had received a huge shock just the other day. For someone like Choi Han who had lived on his own without any human contact other than the villagers of that small village, Western City was completely foreign to him. He may have lived for tens of years already, but he was still young.\u201cAre you not going to say anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you talking to me?\u201dChoi Han finally seemed to have decided that Cale was weak.Cale was weak enough that he could easily kill him even though he was at his limits. That was why Choi Han felt that it would be okay to accept Cale\u2019s goodwill even though he had no idea why Cale was being nice to him.Cale stood up and walked toward Choi Han. The guards would soon come patrolling through this location.\u201cHey.\u201dHe could see Choi Han\u2019s situation better once he got closer. He was a mess. However, maybe it was because he was the main character, but his eyes were clear. The black hair and black pupils that showed that Choi Han was Korean were actually quite nice to see. That was why Cale smiled as he casually spoke to Choi Han.\u201cFollow me. I\u2019ll feed you.\u201dThe best first impression was to be the one who provides delicious food.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: They Met (4)Choi Han stopped leaning against the wall and pushed his body up.His body was leaning to his left probably because his right ankle was uncomfortable, but Cale did not help him or say anything about him. There was no reason to be any nicer to him than he had already been.Cale told Choi Han to follow him as he headed toward the Count\u2019s estate. However, an existence blocked his path.Meeeeeeeeow.The red furred golden eyed kitten ran toward Cale and rubbed its cheeks on Cale\u2019s shoes. Cale started to frown. He didn\u2019t like cats, but this one seemed pretty cute. However, he suddenly felt chills all over his body and turned around. Choi Han was staring at him.\u2018Damn it.\u2019Cale awkwardly started to pet the kitten.\u201cIt seems like it likes me. But I have to go. See you next time.\u201dCale never understood why people talked to animals. However, Cale, who had now become that person that was speaking to animals, quickly stood back up and walked away from the kitten.Grroooooowl.The silver furred golden-eyed kitten growled as if it was telling the red-furred kitten to come back while telling Cale to get lost. The red-furred kitten seemed to not want to go back as it continued to look back at Cale as it walked away. However, Cale did not turn back.Meow, meoooooooow.The sad cries of the kittens were getting farther away. Cale took a peek backwards. Choi Han was limping, but keeping up with him.They made eye contact once more. Cale flinched as he quickly turned his head back. He was walking slowly to make it easier for Choi Han to keep up.They passed the residential area and Cale took another sip of the alcohol.The bars. Market. Plaza. They then passed the residences of the wealthy and finally arrived at the Count\u2019s estate located in the rear of the city.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dCale looked toward Choi Han, who had stopped moving. Choi Han must have seen how the soldiers greeted Cale, as well as how the citizens avoided him, on their way here.Choi Han was probably questioning whether it really would be easy to kill Cale.Cale asked once more.\u201cAre you not going to come?\u201dAs expected, Choi Han resumed walking. His reason for following Cale now was probably to get some information as well as to host the funeral for the villagers of Harris Village.\u201cY, young master?\u201dAs soon as Cale stood at the main entrance of the estate, the guards and knights stumbled over their words as they greeted him.\u2018Sigh. I wish they would stop with that y, young master business.\u2019It was odd hearing them stumbling over their words every time. Since he possessed the body of a trash, he was trying his best to act like one. It was easier to be a trash young master than a noble young master. He was trying to make his life as easy as possible. Cale frowned at the guards\u2019 stumbling of words while the guards quickly opened the gate.\u201cPlease head on in.\u201dCale turned back to look at Choi Han. The rest of them looked at Choi Han as well. They were probably curious about this beggar that followed their young master back. The knights observed Choi Han with suspicion in their eyes.\u201cFollow me.\u201dChoi Han should know of Cale\u2019s status by now. He continued to limp as he approached Cale. Cale looked calm and turned back as soon as he saw that Choi Han was behind him and entered through the gate.But his heart was going crazy.\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking about taking me as a hostage if something dangerous happens. That is probably why he stood right behind me.\u2019He was sure that Choi Han would not kill him. However, just thinking about being taken as hostage caused serious mental strain that Cale frowned as he looked at the two knights who were following them.\u2018Don\u2019t follow me.\u2019The knights flinched at Cale\u2019s clear order. They looked back and forth between Cale and Choi Han before one of the knights approached Choi Han and Cale with a stiff expression on his face.The knights cared about their creed more than anything else. It was fitting of the knights that Deruth treasured.\u2018Well, I guess they have to act like this to be good knights.\u2019Cale was satisfied at the knight\u2019s response to this beggar-like foreigner and left the knight alone to follow them. He just led Choi Han to the entrance of the Count\u2019s residence.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Ron.\u201dThis scary old man. He had been waiting for Cale outside the door. Cale didn\u2019t expect him to really be waiting. Cale was scared, but thought that it was actually for the better.Ron\u2019s gaze turned toward Choi Han, and his benign smile suddenly stiffened.\u2018Ron should be at a level where he can estimate Choi Han\u2019s strength.\u2019Choi Han also stared back at Ron. Cale didn\u2019t care what kind of attacks they were sending each other through their eyes and did what he needed to do. He was not done just yet.\u201cFollow me.\u201dCale called out to Choi Han once more and started to walk. The servant, Ron, quickly followed Cale.\u201cYoung master, what is going on? I will take care of this guest if you tell me what is needed.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dSomeone else approached Cale as Ron was speaking.\u201cYoung master. You returned after drinking today.\u201dIt was the deputy butler Hans.\u2018Ah, he was responsible for me.\u2019Cale clicked his tongue and ignored Hans\u2019s statement. Instead, he lifted up the alcohol bottle and pointed toward Hans. It was at that moment.\u201cAaack!\u201dHans covered his face with both of his arms as he curled up. Silence filled the air.\u201cTsk.\u201dCale clicked his tongue and Hans looked up with a face completely red from embarrassment as he looked back at Cale.\u201cPut this away.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHans received the alcohol bottle from Cale with a blank expression on his face.\u201cI will actually throw it at you next time.\u201dHans turned pale at Cale\u2019s words. Cale did not seem to care at all as he continued to walk. With the inclusion of Hans, there were now a total of four people following him.Cale peeked every so often to make sure they were following him properly and arrived at his destination.Kitchen #2. Cale pushed the door open as soon as he saw the sign.\u201cYoung master?\u201dHe could hear Hans\u2019s confused voice behind him. However, there was a thick smile on Cale\u2019s face. The end was near.Now, Beacrox and Choi Han will meet. Cale\u2019s heart was beating fast. The door easily opened. Cale\u2019s expression stiffened at the scene in front of him inside the door.Clang. Clang.Second Chef Beacrox was smiling while sharpening his blade. He seemed to be enjoying himself while sharpening his blade all alone in kitchen #2. However, that smile disappeared as soon as he saw Cale.That was why Cale was scared. It was always scary to deal with lunatics. You never knew what crazy things a lunatic would do.Cale made a move before Beacrox could respond. He put a hand on Choi Han\u2019s shoulder and pointed at him.\u201cGive him something to eat.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dBeacrox asked with a stiff expression on his face. The sharp blade in his hand was shining as it reflected the light. Cale calmed his shaking heart as he said it once more.\u201cGive him something to eat. He\u2019s hungry.\u201dHo. The knight let out a shocked noise from the back, but Cale did not have the time to pay attention to that right now. He waited for Beacrox\u2019s response with anxiety. Finally, Beacrox answered with a stiff expression still on his face.\u201cI will do as you instructed, young master.\u201dIt was done.Beacrox and Choi Han. And even Ron, someone that he did not expect. The three of them were connected now.A bright smile formed on Cale\u2019s face. He could finally relax as he gave Beacrox another order with a slightly higher tone.\u201cAlso prepare something for me. I\u2019m hungry.\u201dCale thought about the steak from last night\u2019s dinner.\u201cYour steak last night was the best. You are a great chef.\u201dThe tip of Beacrox\u2019s knife slightly shook.\u201cSomething like that steak would be a wonderful meal. Prepare it quickly.\u201dCale turned around without waiting for Beacrox\u2019s response. He then left the kitchen and headed towards his chamber. The knight and Hans followed him, and Hans quickly asked.\u201cWhat should I do about that guest?\u201d\u201cI guess he is my guest. You take care of it.\u201dSince he connected the three of them, he didn\u2019t want to deal with anything else for today.Beacrox and Ron should be able to tell Choi Han\u2019s strength. In the novel, Beacrox originally swears his loyalty to Choi Han because of his strength, so he should pledge his loyalty after figuring out Choi Han\u2019s strength this time too. Of course, Cale had some other plans in the case that Beacrox was unable to determine Choi Han\u2019s strength.All Cale had to do was make Choi Han beat someone or something up, without it being him. Oh, and Beacrox had to be there to watch.Even if it might have some holes, Cale had thought about a lot of different things.\u201cHans. Stop annoying me and just bring the meal over to my chamber when it\u2019s ready.\u201dAs expected, Ron did not follow him. Cale left the knight and Hans outside his chamber door as he closed the door and laid down on the bed. He was happy. His exhaustion and the alcohol made him fall asleep before the food ever showed up.That was why he did not know that Beacrox\u2019s cooking knife slashed toward Choi Han\u2019s neck and that Ron\u2019s sharp dagger was flung toward Choi Han\u2019s heart. Of course, both of their attacks had failed.Well, this was actually a situation that nobody, other than the three involved individuals, would know about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, he brought a young man whose identity we cannot verify. In terms of drinking, he only drank a little bit and kept a clear head.\u201dHans\u2019s report was short, but Deruth found that short report interesting.\u201cShould we put a tail on him?\u201dHe waved his hand to oppose Hans\u2019s question. He didn\u2019t want to know what his son was doing on the outside to the point he would put a tail on him.\u201cNo need. As long as he is in the city, anything he does is under my authority to handle.\u201dDeruth cherished Hans the most out of all the young deputy butlers. It was because he fulfilled orders well and was a good person.\u201cDo what you have been doing in terms of observing Cale inside the house and reporting what you see.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dHans did not say anything else as he bowed his head.Deruth. He was someone who did not have any special abilities nor any solid networks. However, just like the previous Count, he was able to rule over the Henituse territory and grow his wealth by selling marble and wine. He was someone who was able to protect his territory properly.\u2018Cale has changed.\u2019Cale felt different than normal. It wasn\u2019t that he suddenly got smarter or stronger, but that his actions were clearly different from before.\u201cAh, Hans.\u201d\u201cYes, Count-nim?\u201d\u201cBring me some information about the Flynn Merchant Guild.\u201dTea shop owner, Billos. Deruth knew about this bastard son of the Flynn Merchant Guild. This was because the Henituse\u2019s largest trading partner for wine was the Flynn Merchant Guild.\u201cI will get right on it.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dDeruth watched Hans walk out of his office as he started to think. There was a lot of things for him to think about other than the change in Cale\u2019s demeanor.The atmosphere around the continent was dangerous. It was like a volcano right before it erupts. Deruth could clearly feel the dangerous atmosphere despite the fact that he was in the corner of the kingdom. It was because he was always receiving an endless amount of information about it. But the message from the Imperial Court that he received today made Deruth even more certain about the current atmosphere of the continent.The former Counts of the Henituse territory always passed on a single piece of advice to the next in power.\u2018There is no need to be recorded in history. Just live for peace and happiness.\u2019\u201cI guess I need to reinforce the city walls.\u201dHe may not be a good fighter, but Deruth was always thinking about ways to protect himself and his family.There are times when the body is stronger than the mind.\u201cYoung master, you were sleeping so soundly that I did not wake you up.\u201dCale had slept in. The fact that Ron brought lemonade instead of cold water again made things even worse. However, Cale could not say anything about it.It was because there was a bandage around Ron\u2019s neck.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you worrying about me?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just annoying to look at.\u201d\u201cIt is nothing much. I was just scratched by a cat\u2019s claw.\u201dIs a, \u2018cat,\u2019 another reference to an innocent person?Cale was sure that someone would have had their fated meeting last night. He avoided the gaze of Ron, who was smiling, and headed toward the chambers window. He needed to move faster because he slept in.\u201cWill you be heading out right away?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll take care of everything on my own outside.\u201d\u201cI understand. Oh, young master.\u201dCale let go of the door handle and turned to look at Ron. Ron had an odd smile on his face.\u201cWhat do you think about the lemonade?\u201d\u201cGreat. It\u2019s delicious.\u201dRon\u2019s voice became an octave lower.\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018What kind of question was that?\u2019Since Ron was someone he could not ignore, Cale just answered the question as nicely as possible while opening the door.Slam.\u00a0He then quickly closed it right back.\u201c\u2026Ron.\u201dRon approached Cale at his calling and whispered with a smile on his face.\u201cYoung master, were you surprised? Your guest from yesterday is waiting for you outside.\u201dCale was surprised. Cale had seen Choi Han staring at him as soon as he opened the door, which caused him to close the door in shock. His hand headed to the inner pocket of his shirt. The 10 million gallons in his pocket calmed him down.Ron gazed toward Cale as he continued to speak.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to tell you because you opened the door right away. I told him to wait comfortably in his room, but he insisted that he needed to see you and waited outside the door.\u201d\u2018Didn\u2019t have a chance to tell me my ass.\u2019Cale could not say anything to this terrible old man who definitely had the chance but chose not to tell him. Cale moved a step away from Ron as he opened the door again.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dCale pretended like he never slammed the door as he started to chat with Choi Han. He was paying attention to Choi Han\u2019s appearance as he asked.After taking a shower, fixing his hair, and wearing new clothes, a pure and clean feeling was coming from Choi Han. However, it was difficult to think like that after seeing his eyes.Choi Han was still in a twisted state. That was why looking at his eyes made Cale feel a bit scared. Choi Han was also staring back at Cale before finally starting to speak.\u201cPay you back.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI will pay you back for the meal.\u201dChoi Han was speaking formally unlike yesterday. More importantly, Cale started to frown at the words, \u2018pay you back.\u2019\u2018Pay me back? Is he trying to make me have a heart attack?\u2019Who in their right mind would use Choi Han for manual labor? Cale just wanted Choi Han to get out of this city as soon as possible.Of course, Choi Han would agree to help Cale out if he said it was to pay him back. He was that kind of person. However, Cale didn\u2019t have anything he needed from Choi Han.\u201cNo need. Is there anything else you need?\u201dHe quickly rejected Choi Han\u2019s offer and asked if there was anything else he needed. Choi Han started to observe Cale even more closely. That gaze made Cale think about how Cale got beaten to a pulp in the novel, and his arms started to develop goosebumps. Choi Han started to speak at that point.\u201cThere is something I would like to request for your help.\u201dCale closed his eyes at the word, \u2018help.\u2019 He did not want to get involved with Choi Han. The, \u2018help,\u2019 that Choi Han would ask about could be nothing other than something regarding Harris Village.The Cale in the novel called the villagers of Harris Village useless, and ended up getting beaten up because of it. Cale thought about that as he opened his mouth.\u201cTell Hans your request. He will take care of everything.\u201dAfter opening his eyes again, Cale made eye contact with Choi Han, who was standing there as still as a statue.\u201cHe is a talented deputy butler. He will be able to help you out with almost any normal request.\u201dCale then put a hand on Ron\u2019 shoulder. He could feel Ron flinch, but Cale decided to get both of them out of his sight at the same time.\u201cRon here is pretty useful as well. He will also be able to help you out. Ron, he is my guest. Make sure to take proper care of whatever he needs.\u201dCale also gave Ron an order before moving his hand off of Ron\u2019s shoulder. He then heard Choi Han calling out to him.\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know who I am.\u201dCale turned around to look. He could see Choi Han still observing him. The scary feeling emitting from him had disappeared, and Cale could only feel an unexplainable purity coming from Choi Han.\u201cWhy do I need to know who you are? Is there a reason to help someone who does not have as much as I have?\u201dChoi Han started to frown a bit at Cale\u2019s words. It was very faint, but Cale, who had been closely observing Choi Han, definitely saw it.\u2018Is he annoyed that I said someone who does not have as much as I do?\u2019Cale quickly continued on.\u201cBased on your situation, I doubt you\u2019ll ask for something difficult. Well, if it is something difficult, I\u2019m sure Hans will know where to draw the line.\u201dHe pushed Ron toward Choi Han as he turned away from the two of them.\u201cThen goodbye. I have a lot of things to do.\u201dCale quickly headed toward his father Deruth\u2019s office. He needed to get a large amount of allowance today. He could hear Ron\u2019s voice coming from his behind him.\u201cYoung master, I will do as you commanded.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t care whether you do or do not.\u2019Frying and stirring was for them to do as the main characters, not Cale. Wouldn\u2019t they get closer to each other faster since they met four days earlier thanks to him?Ron looked toward Cale, who was moving away from the both of them, before looking down at the empty cup in his hands.\u201cInteresting.\u201dThat fearless puppy did not like sour things. He still did not like it. However, he now drank it.Ron touched his neck. He had been hurt for the first time in a long time, but something more interesting than the injury kept nagging at him.The fearless puppy was scared of him.Does he know something?\u201cLead the way.\u201dRon turned his gaze toward the source of the voice. He could see Choi Han looking at him with disgust. This punk seemed to have figured out that he was someone who has killed after their short spar last night.\u201cSure.\u201dThis punk, who also gave off a similar scent of blood, was pretending to be clean. Ron found it funny that such a twisted punk was acting that way.This punk, that they met last night, gave off the violent, disgusting, and murderous aura of the Forest of Darkness. It was an aura that and Ron and Beacrox could instantly tell apart from other auras.Of course, that murderous aura was not Choi Han\u2019s own. Choi Han had gotten that aura from the assassins he had killed, and now that he had showered and cleaned up, the murderous aura was no longer surrounding him.\u2018I guess there is no way those people would cross over.\u2019Ron thought about the events of last night as he started to talk to the boy who seemed to have gone through a lot in the past few days.\u201cFollow me.\u201dRon started to walk in order to follow his puppy young master\u2019s order, and Choi Han followed behind him. Choi Han\u2019s gaze momentarily headed toward Cale\u2019s direction before turning back to Ron.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two siblings were there to greet him once again.The children kept their mouth shut as they looked toward Cale. Cale smiled as he took out two small bags and pushed them toward the children.\u201cTake it.\u201dThe young girl slowly approached him. Cale frowned as he watched the girl with coarse grey hair approach him. She had a hand on her side as she limped over to him.\u201cHey.\u201dCale pushed the two bags toward the young boy.\u201cYou come here and take it.\u201dThe young boy quickly rushed over and snatched the bags before quickly running back. Compared to Cale\u2019s bright red hair, the boy had coarse dark red hair that shook as he ran.Cale then turned around and headed toward the man-eating tree.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bread. It\u2019s meat and cake.\u201dHe could hear the siblings talking about the food, but he did not care. He continued to walk toward the man-eating tree\u2019s territory.Oooooooooooooong-\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a bit scary.\u201dThe black tree without any leaves seemed to be moving its branches to welcome Cale. This eerie feeling made Cale nervous, but he still poured the contents of the bag into the hole underneath the tree.The bread quickly disappeared.It was at that moment.\u201c\u2026More, give me more.\u201d\u2018\u2026It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u2019The response he read about in the novel showed up. It was the voice of a weak girl. Yes, the person who starved to death was a priestess who served a god. However, unlike the present day priestesses of the temples or churches, the ancient priestesses were shamans. The majority of the ancient shamans could be considered people who had superpowers or natural forces under their command.Cale quickly grabbed the bag and started to move.\u2018Cale, come to my study tonight.\u2019That was what his father, Deruth, had said to Cale when he went to get some allowance. That was why he had to leave here before evening at the latest.\u2018Half.\u2019He came here with the intention of taking care of half of the gluttony of the tree today. He went back down the hill to get more bread. He could see the two siblings looking at him with cake on their lips.\u201cTsk.\u201dCale frowned and clicked his tongue as he walked past the two siblings.Cale then walked to the street where there were a lot of bakeries. He had already swept the stock of the bakery he went to yesterday this morning, so it would take them some time to restock. That was why he needed to look for another bakery. It was at that moment.\u201cY, young master.\u201dA woman\u2019s voice made Cale turn his head. A middle-aged woman smiled awkwardly as she pointed to her shop. Her hand was shaking and she was full of fear, but she still had some confidence.\u201cWe have a lot of bread.\u201dCale started to smile. Now this was a woman who knew how to do business. The other vendors were peeking their way while looking at what was going on.Cale threw her a gold coin and the woman quickly picked it up.\u201cGive me everything you have. Pack it quickly.\u201dIn that instant, the smile on the middle-aged woman\u2019s face grew wider. She instantly went into the store and immediately came back out with a large bag full of bread. She had already packed it all up in advance.\u201cHere it is, young master.\u201d\u2018Wow. She really is a good merchant.\u2019This was someone who knew how to make money.\u201cI can also prepare some more.\u201dCale liked this woman even more. However, at that instant\u2026\u201cYoung master! We can make even more bread than that!\u201dAn old man across the street raised his hand as he rushed over. He was wearing a baker\u2019s uniform. Cale liked his fitting outfit and threw a gold coin to him as well.\u201cI will head to your shop next. Have a bag ready.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dCale was amazed by these vendors. They were still afraid of him because of his identity as the trash of the Count\u2019s family, but they had no issues coming up to him to make some easy money. It was probably because they knew that Cale did not hit anybody who was not a gangster, but he still could see why the Henituse territory was doing so well.The fact that Cale had spent a gold coin to buy a bag of bread yesterday had already spread like wildfire. 1 million gallons. The others gasped at the week\u2019s worth of profit while their eyes started to sparkle.\u2018I can go around to those three places tomorrow to get bread.\u2019Since he gave each of them a gold coin, he should be able to get another bag from them tomorrow. Cale was happy that things were going so smoothly.However, there was someone who was watching him from afar.\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was the chef, Beacrox. Just like his father, he had a bandage around his neck, and he was watching Cale from behind a corner. He just watched Cale buy the bag of bread and some medicinal herbs before heading back to the slums.\u201c\u2026Did he go crazy?\u201dCale seemed like he had gone crazy since yesterday.Beacrox had never cared about Cale, even when his father had said that Cale was an interesting kid, but, the more he saw, the more he started to agree. It felt like it would be just as fun to watch Cale as it was to watch the black-haired punk. Beacrox\u2019s eyes started to sparkle.Billos, the owner of the tea shop with the highest view, took a sip of his tea as he received his subordinate\u2019s report.\u201cYoung master Cale is going in and out of the slums?\u201d\u201cYes, Billos-nim.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cWe also received communication from the capital.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dBillos\u2019s round eyes, that were hard to see because of his fat, opened widely. The subordinate flinched for a moment before continuing his report.\u201cYes. It mentioned that the crown will soon gather people. That is why they wish for Billos-nim to return and get to work.\u201dClank.Billos put the teacup on the table as he motioned with his chin.\u201cYou can head out now.\u201dThe subordinate quickly moved into the shadows and disappeared. Billos stared at the spot his subordinate was standing in as one corner of his lips twisted upward.\u201cDo they think I will be their dog and watch the house again?\u201dHis gaze headed out of the window. It felt like his gaze could reach the far away capital.\u201cThis, this isn\u2019t bread. Isn\u2019t bread.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dSeeing the young girl who was mumbling, \u2018isn\u2019t bread,\u2019 over and over as she held the medicinal herbs in her hand, Cale just snorted as he headed back to the man-eating tree. However, the young boy got in his way.\u201cYou cannot die.\u201dIt was the young boy saying he cannot die now. Cale did not even frown as he just walked past the young boy.Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo.He was an orphan and didn\u2019t have anything to his name. That was why there were a lot of people who showed the poor Kim Rok Soo a lot of sympathy.\u2018Is there a reason to show sympathy for the needy?\u2019That was something he heard all the time when he was younger.\u2018Young beggar.\u2019\u2018Poor orphan.\u2019\u2018You don\u2019t need a reason to show sympathy.\u2019There was a time he just took that at face value, but he started to understand the real meaning of it as he got older.There wasn\u2019t a logical reason for the things your heart draws you to do. You didn\u2019t need a reason.\u201cSo annoying.\u201dCale hated to see young children being hurt. However, he didn\u2019t have any thoughts about nursing the young girl nor thoughts of consoling her. He frowned toward the young girl who was limping toward him and the young boy next to her as he answered them.\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201dThe siblings finally stopped following him once he said that. Cale was unhappy at the thought that he did something he hated the most. He hated people who got involved in other people\u2019s business without being asked, but he had done just that by giving the young girl the medicinal herbs.Oooooooooooong.-More, give me more.\u201cYes. Eat it all.\u201dCale dumped the whole bag into the man-eating tree without caring about how it landed. He was not afraid. The bread instantly disappeared into the darkness that was now too light to be called darkness. Cale could now see a new grey light. However, it would only seem grey to him.\u2018I guess it is paying off for the money I spent.\u2019Cale poured the other bag of bread into the hole as he headed back home. He didn\u2019t see the siblings anymore, but that was better for Cale.However, he saw the two struggling cats on his way back home and flinched.\u2018It\u2019s the cats from yesterday. They shouldn\u2019t remember me, right?\u2019Silver fur and golden eyes, dark red fur and golden eyes. The two cats did not even meow as they stared at Cale. Cale did not want to cause a scene, and just looked away as he headed back home.He then heard something from his father that almost made him faint.\u201c\u2026 Could you please say that one more time.\u201d\u201cYes. Cale.\u201dBasen was standing next to Cale as well. The story of the Henituse family that was not mentioned in the novel was happening in front of Cale\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou shall go to the capital as our family\u2019s representative.\u201dCale could feel a headache coming.\u201cOriginally, Basen was supposed to go. However, you are the first born of our family.\u201dCale just opened and closed his mouth repeatedly as he watched Count Deruth sitting there with a gentle smile. Going to visit the crown at such a time. Cale was quickly thinking about the contents of \u2018The Birth of a Hero\u2019 as Deruth continued to speak.\u201cThe crown is hosting a big event, and the noble families of each territory have been invited to gather. It will be your first time to go visit the crown, but Basen has been going to similar functions for the last two years. However, I am hoping for you to go this time.\u201dBig event hosted by the crown. That made Cale think about a single incident.The Plaza Terror Incident.A secret organization commits a terrorist act when many of the citizens of the capital are gathered in one place. Our hero Choi Han is the one who manages to block about half of their plot. That would be the fourth time that Choi Han and the secret organization would come into contact with each other.As a result, Choi Han is able to save a lot of the citizens at the plaza and becomes connected with the crown prince. They then quickly develop a friendship with each other.Cale suddenly got the chills.Since the novel described the event from Choi Han\u2019s point of view, it did not talk much about the gathering of the nobles. All it mentioned was that Choi Han gains some party members before and after the incident, as well as the strong backing of the crown prince.But he had to go to the scene of that terrorist attack?Of course, he did not know whether the nobles would gather in the plaza as well. Cale started to recall the information in \u2018The Birth of a Hero.[Tons of people were gathered in the plaza. The platform was still empty. It was for the royal family that would soon arrive. Choi Han could see some other people who looked like they held important positions. However, more important to Choi Han, was the fact that a lot of citizens, young, old, male, female, were gathered here. Choi Han\u2019s heart started to beat faster.He did not want to see a group of innocent people dying ever again.]Would people who looked like they held important positions include the nobles?Cale turned to look at Basen even as his father was continuing to speak. Basen stood there stoically, looking at his father without giving Cale a single glance.\u2018Deruth said Basen normally goes to events like this. Should I tell him to go?\u2019Cale\u2019s mouth continued to repeatedly open and close. He did not want to go to a dangerous area. However, he could not bring himself to say Basen\u2019s name.A relationship that was neither good nor bad. That was the relationship between the original Cale and Basen. Basen found Cale to be difficult, but that was it.Cale\u2019s mind started to get complicated. Would Cale have gone in the story? There was no way Deruth would send the trash to the capital. Just why was he trying to send him then? Cale was wondering if he had done something wrong to have caused this to happen.\u201cYou will leave in five days.\u201dFive days later. Hearing Deruth say that, Cale knew that the Cale in the novel had not gone to the capital.In the novel, he was beaten to a pulp by Choi Han four days later and carried into the Count\u2019s estate. There was no way he could go to the capital in that condition.\u201cCale. Before Basen started to do it, you had participated in all of these ceremonies. Think back on those times and have a relaxed journey.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dDeruth looked toward Cale at his calling. Basen slowly turned to look at his older brother as well.\u201cI am a bit anxious because of this sudden development. I have not gone to any of these since two years ago. I don\u2019t understand why I would suddenly have to go. Please let me think about it.\u201dDeruth agreed and told his two sons that they could leave. The siblings quickly left the study. Cale was busy thinking about all sorts of things. If Cale threw a fit and caused a scene, Deruth would probably send Basen, but that would leave a bitter taste in his mouth.It was at that moment.\u201cHyung-nim.\u201dCale could hear his young brother, Basen\u2019s voice. Cale turned his head. He could see Basen still stoically walking without looking at him. The 15 year old Basen always talked like this without ever making eye contact.\u201cHyung-nim, there is no reason you cannot go.\u201dSigh. Cale let out a sigh.Basen did not even look at Cale as he left the study and headed to his own room. Cale stared at Basen for a long time.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not supposed to go like this.\u201dCale had been pushed out of the successor spot. Cale could not stop acting like trash even when his younger brother flat out acted like he was the family\u2019s successor since two years ago. He was the joke of the family.That was why there were a lot of reasons he should not go as the family representative to the crown\u2019s summon. However, Basen was saying that there were no reasons not to go to the event.Basen was saying that there were enough reasons for Cale to go as the family representative.\u2018Things will become complicated like this.\u2019Cale stated to frown. He did not like how things were going.But the other problem was\u2026\u2018It\u2019s worth a shot.\u2019He thought it was worth going through the events that were about to come up.The reason was that the chances of Cale coming back without dying or getting hurt were pretty high.\u2018It will also make it difficult for me if Basen dies without being able to take the Count position.\u2019In order for Cale to live a peaceful life, Basen needed to survive. There was still their youngest sister, Lily, but she was too young. Furthermore, Cale needed to head out of Western City after taking the ancient power located at the man-eating tree in order to take some other ancient powers located outside the Henituse territory.The scale inside Cale\u2019s mind started to tilt.He started to stare at deputy butler Hans who was heading his way. Hans\u2019s expression was intense, but not dark. He seemed to be a bit bitter, but his eyes were clear.\u201cYoung master, the request that your guest has asked for-\u201d\u201cHans.\u201dCale cut him off as he said something else.\u201cBring that guest here.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale was not going to be pushed around. If he was going to have to move, he might as well do it in a way that was most comfortable for him and in a way that was most beneficial for him.\u201cAh, if he doesn\u2019t want to come, just tell him this.\u201dBased on Hans\u2019s expression, Cale was certain that Choi Han\u2019s issue was settled properly. In the novel, Count Deruth gave a proper funeral for the villagers and took care of everything even after Choi Han beat Cale to a pulp.

Were the three of them getting along as expected?\u201cBased on what I\u2019ve been told, he is learning how to cook basic dishes from chef Beacrox.\u201d\u201cCooking?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOne corner of Cale\u2019s lips went up.\u2018Cooking my ass.\u2019They were calling it, \u2018cooking,\u2019 but he was probably learning about torturing or Beacrox and Ron were admiring Choi Han\u2019s sword skill. Cale didn\u2019t need to see it to know the truth.Cale naturally walked over and sat down at his desk. He then casually asked Hans, who was idly standing in the corner.\u201cWhat did he ask for?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHans seemed shocked at Cale\u2019s sudden words, before quickly putting on a serious expression and started to report. It was the information Cale expected it to be.Hans could not hide his sorrow and disappointment while sharing about what happened to Harris Village, and had gone to the Count with Choi Han to deliver the Village Chief\u2019s Plaque that Choi Han brought.\u201cFather met with him?\u201d\u201cYes. The Count immediately ordered for a funeral and will be sending inspectors, knights, and soldiers to investigate.\u201dMm. Hans stopped for a moment and hesitated before continuing to speak.\u201cHowever, the guest has indicated he will not be going back with us.\u201dHans recalled meeting the Count with Choi Han, as Choi Han explained the situation to the Count.Choi Han was speaking normally, but the tips of his fingers were shaking. It was then that Hans found out that Choi Han was 17 years old. He was able to keep his life because he happened to be searching for medicinal herbs on his own at the time of the massacre, but he still had to watch his neighbors and friends all being killed at such a young age. Just how much shock would he have received?\u201cWill that be okay?\u201dThat was why Hans had asked Cale. Will it be okay for him to not say his final farewell?\u201cIt is his decision.\u201dCale answered Hans\u2019s question and changed the topic. He already knew why Choi Han did not want to return. He had already said his goodbye as he buried them. All that was left was to get his revenge on the people that took their future away.\u201cHas Ron been taking care of him?\u201d\u201cYes. He has made sure that the guest eats every meal. He has also been very friendly with him.\u201dThe three of them did indeed seemed to be getting along.\u201cAh.\u201dHans seemed to have remembered something as he continued to speak.\u201cMr. Ron seems to have hurt himself while working again. He had bandages around his wrist.\u201d\u201cReally? Make sure to give him some medicine.\u201d\u2018He probably killed someone again.\u2019That was what Cale was thinking. He heard Hans\u2019s voice at that time.\u201c\u2026I will make sure to deliver young master\u2019s words and feelings to Mr. Ron.\u201d\u201cSure, whatever.\u201dHans opened his mouth to say something as he looked at Cale\u2019s nonchalant expression, but a different noise filled the study.Knock Knock KnockChoi Han had arrived. Hans opened the door, and Cale could see Choi Han standing outside. Cale waved his hand to send Hans away, and Hans bowed his head as he quietly exited the study. Only Cale and Choi Han were left in the room.Cale kept the desk between them as he pointed at the chair across from him.\u201cCome sit down.\u201dChoi Han slowly looked around the study as he sat down on the chair. Cale gave him enough time to look around the study.Like a typical pure and smart hero, Choi Han liked books. That was why the first thing he did after coming out of the Forest of Darkness and arriving in Harris Village was to learn how to read from the Chief. After looking around for a long time, Choi Han\u2019s gaze finally landed on Cale.\u201cWhat is the payment?\u201d\u2018Getting right to the point.\u2019Cale smiled looking at how Choi Han didn\u2019t beat around the bush.Payment. Choi Han was thorough when it came to debts he owed.Cale, Kim Rok Soo, realized that he had changed the contents of the beginning of \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 He could see that even more things would change because of it. That was why he was trying his best to not change too many things, but\u2026He had to go to the capital. Then even more things will change.Cale put a piece of paper on the desk as he looked toward Choi Han.\u201cThere is a way for you to pay back for the meal, but I need to first determine whether you will be capable of doing it. In simple terms, this is an interview.\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead.\u201dChoi Han immediately agreed to Cale\u2019s talk of checking his qualifications. Cale started to ask.\u201cDo you know how to protect people?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What do you mean?\u201dChoi Han flinched for the first time and asked after a moment. Cale\u2019s gaze started to turn sharp. He was looking at the piece of paper on the desk and not at Choi Han.Although he had to quickly change the plan, it might bring him more gains than before. He could prevent Choi Han\u2019s party from getting the ancient powers while taking the ones that he needs for himself.Those powers were useless to them anyways.Cale kept his gaze on the paper as he continued to speak.\u201cSimple. Are you capable of protecting people instead of killing people?\u201dSilence filled the room. Choi Han did not have an answer. Cale removed his gaze from the paper and looked at the person sitting on the chair. Choi Han was sitting there with his head down, but eventually answered.\u201cI am not sure.\u201dTsk. Cale clicked his tongue. This was why it was dangerous to provoke Choi Han right now.\u201cBut you can kill someone?\u201dThe answer came easily this time.\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u201cThen you should be able to protect people as well.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s eyes shook for a moment.\u201cThat is difficult.\u201d\u201cBut difficult does not mean impossible.\u201dThere were not many things in the world you could avoid because it was difficult. The life that Cale had lived was like that. That was why he was so happy to possess the body of a trash like Cale who could do whatever he wants. But, unfortunately, there was now a mountain he needed to first climb in order to have that damn peaceful future.Cale was looking for someone to climb and flip that mountain for him.Choi Han had a bitter smile on his face.\u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cYes, it is. Now the final interview question.\u201d\u201cYes. Please ask.\u201dCale looked into Choi Han\u2019s firm gaze as he asked the last question.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know my name?\u201d\u2018Of course, I do. You\u2019re the person who was going to beat me up.\u2019\u201cI have heard from other people, but I want to hear it directly from you.\u201d\u201cChoi Han.\u201dChoi Han reached his hand out.\u201cMy name is Choi Han.\u201dCale shook Choi Han\u2019s hand.\u201cGreat. I am Cale Henituse.\u201dThe short conversation called an interview quickly finished. Of course, it was a passing grade. Cale pushed the paper on the desk toward Choi Han.\u201cThe way you can pay me back is simple.\u201dThere were two names written on the paper. It also indicated where he would meet them.\u201cGo to the capital with these people.\u201dThese were the party members Choi Han would meet on his way to the capital. Beacrox and these two people would grow and get strong with Choi Han until volume 5.Rosalyn and Lock.One was the princess of a neighboring kingdom who was returning to her kingdom after surviving an assassination attempt, and the other was an injured kid. Of course, that kid was the heir to the Wolf King. It was possible for him to transform into a wolf.Princess Rosalyn was strong and cold. She had the most explosiveness after Choi Han and used her strength logically.She was not interested in taking control of the throne. Instead, her goal was to create the continent\u2019s greatest Magic Tower, and she would grow into a hero as she moved closer to her goal.\u2018The Archduke of the kingdom, who attempted the assassination on Rosalyn, will be tortured by Beacrox in the future.\u2019Cale\u2019s heart started to shake as he recalled just how clear and descriptive that torture scene had been in the novel. His heart seemed to be shaking quite a bit these days.\u201cRosalyn. Lock.\u201dCale nodded his head at Choi Han\u2019s voice.\u201cYes. Those two people. I\u2019m glad you know how to read.\u201dChoi Han continued to stare at the two names. Cale\u2019s gaze fell on the name Lock.Lock. This world had other races such as Elves, Dwarves, and Beast People. However, the most secretive of all races were the Beast People.Beast People. This included beasts, birds, and even insects. Beast People were different from monsters because of the existence of a conscience.\u2018Lock has the purest blood of the wolf people.\u2019Lock had received the bloodline to dominate the wolves. The Beast People with the purest bloodline tend to look weak and average when they are in their animal form or their human form. However, once they enter their berserk state, they become more cruel and violent than anyone else. And Lock was the only survivor of the entire Blue Wolf tribe.Cale took a map out of a drawer and opened it up on the desk.\u201cYou will start the journey with me.\u201dHe then pointed to a location on the map.\u201cWe will separate at this point. You just follow what I wrote on the paper.\u201dChoi Han didn\u2019t ask any questions and just quietly listened. Cale watched Choi Han for a bit. There was a reason Choi Han had to go with him until that specific point.\u2018I need to avoid the crazy dragon.\u2019The beginning of \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 Like any other novel, new villains had to appear after Cale. However, those villains were not easy picking like Cale.The next villain involved a Marquis who led one of the noble factions. Throughout the beginning of the novel, he gets in the way of the crown prince and Choi Han. He ends up being ruined around volume 2, but Choi Han runs into the Marquis for the first time on this trip to the capital.\u2018That bastard raised the crazy dragon.\u2019It definitely was a crazy dragon.It was still just a baby dragon. That black dragon was being tortured by the Marquis\u2019s future successor in secret. They were training it to obey the Marquis\u2019s commands.\u2018They\u2019re crazy too. Dragons are the strongest beings in the world. How do they think they will be able to tame a dragon?\u2019It actually does make sense.The Marquis managed to get his hands on a Dragon egg through the secret organization and chained it down with mana restricting chains as soon as it hatched. Cale could not fathom the extent of the strength of that secret organization.But would dragons be called the strongest beings in the world for no reason?This black dragon, that was less than 5 years old, was still a dragon. In the end, the dragon goes crazy and berserk.It may be young, but in the novel, it exploded with enough mana to remove the mana restricting chains. Since its mana was restricted, the mana it exploded was actually its own life force.After living in a cave and being tortured every day without ever being able to see sunlight, the young dragon cuts into its own life force to find freedom.After managing to escape, the dragon ends up losing its rationality and goes berserk.The village that Choi Han is staying at the time almost ends up in danger because of the berserk dragon, and Choi Han ends up fighting against the black dragon.[Choi Han gazed at the small dragon that was less than 1 meter long. It managed to blow up a mountain with that small body and put the villagers in significant danger. However, Choi Han could not easily attack this dragon.][The eyes of this dragon that had lost its rationality, were in pain and full of sorrow. However, the black dragon\u2019s mouth was smiling. Choi Han found that to be extremely sad.]Choi Han ends up killing that black dragon and gifting it the freedom called death.Cale had to go to that village.\u2018Either Choi Han takes care of it or I prevent it from going crazy and find a way to release it.\u2019There was no other choice because it was on his way to the capital. He would need to take an extremely long detour to avoid that village, and that would require a long time and change the flow of the story. He would also be late in arriving at the capital if he took that detour.\u2018For being a crazy dragon, it\u2019s described as being a really cute dragon.\u2019The novel described it as a cute black dragon with short legs. It mentioned that it was even scarier that such a cute existence had gone crazy and caused chaos. Cale decided to stop thinking about the dragon for now, and instead gave Choi Han the rest of the order.\u201cCome to the capital with the owners of these two names. That is your way of paying me back.\u201dChoi Han asked as question.\u201c\u2026I just need to protect these two people?\u201d\u201cIf you want to.\u201dThese two people should be strong enough to not require Choi Han\u2019s protection. Especially princess Rosalyn, she wouldn\u2019t even budge an inch even if a truck load of Cales with the Indestructible Shield attacked her at the same time.\u201cDo as you wish. However, you must definitely come to the capital. You must also meet me there without being injured. You can at least keep yourself safe, right?\u201dCale and Choi Han should have no reason to meet again after that. Choi Han has another negative encounter with the secret organization after getting involved with Lock. Meeting with Lock should allow Choi Han to stop the danger in the capital like in the novel.\u201cWhy are you not answering? Can you do it?\u201dChoi Han\u2019s gaze became a bit clearer.\u201cYes. I can do it.\u201dHe seemed to be speaking in a more respectful tone than before, but Cale just let it be. He relaxed a bit after seeing Choi Han put the paper in his chest pocket.\u2018I should have been drinking as I did that.\u2019It was really tiring to talk to Choi Han with Cale\u2019 body.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201dCale waved his hand at Choi Han. Choi Han started to walk toward the door after seeing Cale\u2019s gesture. Cale leaned his back on the chair and watched Choi Han reach for the door before starting to speak again.\u201cIn addition, everything we discussed here is a secret. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that?\u201dChoi Han did not look back and answered as he opened the door.\u201cOf course.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s voice seemed to indicate that he was smiling, but Cale did not care. Once he was alone, Cale took out a piece of paper and pen and started to write in Korean. After writing for a while, he left the study and headed for his father\u2019s office.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI need money.\u201d\u201cOkay. I will tell Hans to give you some.\u201dCale needed a lot of money. Once Cale laid down on the bed with another 10 million gallon check in his chest pocket, Ron approached him and put a bottle on the nightstand as he started to speak.\u201cIt is warm lemon honey tea. My son made it especially for you, young master. Please have a good night. I am always by your side.\u201dCale\u2019s sleepiness went away in an instant.No matter what happened, he needed to make sure the two of them went away with Choi Han.The next day, Cale Henituse headed to the slums as soon as he woke up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard about everything from deputy butler Hans. This Ron will do whatever I can with my lacking abilities to make sure you can shine at the capital.\u2019Cale\u2019s shoulders were starting to shake as he walked out of the Count\u2019s estate. He was thinking about the conversation he had with Ron as soon as he woke up this morning.\u2018This is going to be your first time outside the Henituse territory, right? I am very good at hunting rabbits. I will hunt some rabbits for you when we are camping outside.\u2019Ron\u2019s calm and benign voice echoed in Cale\u2019s ears. He felt as if he could still hear Ron\u2019s voice echoing like a hallucination throughout the fog outside.Cale was scared of the fact that Ron was explaining to him about how to hunt a rabbit first thing in the morning.\u2018You need to be careful when handling a small animal like a rabbit that gets scared easily. Since you don\u2019t know when or how it will run, you need to pay attention to the surroundings and kill it in an instant. Ah, you also need to remove the innards after catching it. I am also very good at that.\u2019Cale had to turn away as Ron mimicked cutting open a rabbit with his hands. Ron was excited. However, the only thought Cale was having right now was that Ron was toying with him. Cale was just happy that Ron was heading to the capital with him.I can tack on Beacrox as my personal chef.Ron. Beacrox. Cale had already told Hans this morning, so that he could bring the father and son duo with him. Of course, Ron was there as well.\u2018Hans, I want to take Beacrox as my personal chef for this trip.\u2019\u2018May I ask, why Beacrox? He is extremely busy running Kitchen #2.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know. But I can\u2019t eat anything other than Beacrox\u2019s cooking. I will be taking him, so you figure out the rest.\u2019Hans became anxious, but Ron seemed to be happy to be going with his son.\u2018Young master, my son will be very happy. We had a need to go to the capital anyways. I will deliver your exact words to him.\u2019Cale relaxed after hearing Ron\u2019s words. He was worried that they would say no, but Beacrox should enjoy leaving the Henituse territory and traveling to the capital as well.Cale walked through the foggy Western City as he thought about the people he would take with him to the capital. The story was progressing a little differently than the novel, but it wasn\u2019t like he could give up on gaining some benefits for himself.\u201cYoung master, you are here early today.\u201dThe baker seemed to be pretty relaxed around Cale after seeing him a couple of times. Cale just stoically asked the baker.\u201cThe bread?\u201dThe baker smiled as he handed Cale a bag full of bread.\u201cOf course, I have it all ready. But is today really the last day?\u201d\u201cWhy? Greedy for more money?\u201d\u201cYes, I definitely am.\u201dCale started to smile. He liked honest answers like this. Cale patted the shoulder of the baker, who seemed to be a bit more relaxed around him, and headed for the slums.\u201cI\u2019ll come back when I want to eat it again.\u201dThe baker longingly watched as Cale disappeared into the fog and then started to pray. He was praying for Cale to come back and spend a ton of money.Cale naturally did not know about the baker\u2019s prayer as he walked over to the slums. He then saw the siblings waiting for him.\u2018Do these kids not have a home?\u2019Cale had come much earlier than usual. However, the siblings were curled up together and waiting for him, as if they had been waiting at the top of the hill all night. The younger brother seemed to be leaning into his older sister\u2019s embrace.The siblings were quietly looking up at Cale. Their hair and clothes seemed damp, probably because they stayed here through the foggy morning.Of course, Cale pretended not to notice.\u201cHere, take it.\u201dThe young boy took both of their shares from Cale. Cale waited until the boy picked it up before turning around and heading for the man-eating tree.\u2018I\u2019m glad it is foggy.\u2019The fog made it difficult to see. Since this hill was the highest point in Western City, other than the Count\u2019s estate, the fog was even thicker up here. Nobody else would be able to see what Cale is doing, or more importantly, what Cale receives from the tree.More, give me more. Please.Cale poured a bag of bread into the hole while listening to the eerie voice of the grudge-filled soul as usual. The darkness inside the hole was slowly turning from grey to white. Cale started to smile, thinking that all his efforts were not for naught. It was at that moment.More, more, more!\u2018What?\u2019Cale flinched and stepped backwards at the voice that now turned into a shriek.\u2018The novel didn\u2019t mention something like this.\u2019More, more! I will give you a present if you bring me more. A present.Present. That word made Cale\u2019s eyes start to sparkle. Although he didn\u2019t expect the soul to go crazy like this, the end was near.\u201cJust wait.\u201dThe black branch started to sway, as if nodding at him. It felt like a scene out of a horror movie. Cale shivered as he started to move back through the fog. It was the middle of the morning now, but the sun was not out, and the fog continued to get thicker.It looked like it would start to rain soon.The siblings must have gone somewhere, as he did not see them, but Cale just thought they went to dodge the rain and put the third bag of bread in front of the man-eating tree.\u2018This should be the last bunch.\u2019The light inside the hole was now as white as the fog surrounding Cale.\u2018It should become transparent after I put this last bag of bread in.\u2019Cale was full of anticipation as he poured the last bag into the tree.And finally.Ooooooooooong-A rumbling that was worlds different than the past rumblings poured out from the tree toward Cale. This rumbling, that was only aimed at Cale, did not catch his attention because of the hole that was starting to turn transparent. It should be dark inside the hole because of the shadow of the tree, but such a realistic situation did not occur.That was the Ancient Power.The moment Cale saw the Ancient Power, he could hear the voice that had been asking him for more food until now.It was so, so good!That voice was \u2026 obnoxious.That soft texture of bread! I especially liked the third bag of bread you brought. I guess even food develops as time goes by. There was no such thing as bread back in my days! The wheat itself must grow on a really fertile land! Yes, not all wheat is the same \u2013\u2026The voice was evaluating the taste of the bread.A storm caused by the voice started to rush toward Cale.\u2018This wasn\u2019t in the novel!\u2019The spirit that was tied down to the earth because of its grudge was resolving that grudge by evaluating the taste of the bread. Cale started to frown further. He was only thinking about the Ancient Power in \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 This Indestructible Shield was the only Ancient Power that was written about in the novel but never claimed by anyone.\u2018No wonder nobody ended up taking control of it. But then why would the author mention something that could be useful but was never actually taken by anybody?\u2019That was the thought in Cale\u2019s head, however, the obnoxious voice continued to chatter away, making him unable to focus.\u2026 That\u2019s why I am so full! It was delicious!Chatter chatter. It felt like the grudge was from not being able to speak instead of not being able to eat.After hearing the spirit chat on and on for a couple of minutes, evaluating all of the different types of breads that Cale had brought, Cale nodded his head and tried to cut the voice off.Things like this were not available in ancient times. The people of the Forest of Darkness claimed to be servants of a god yet only gave me tasteless things.However, Cale decided to wait a little longer after hearing the spirit mention the ancient times.I was, naturally, banished from that place. They said I was a glutton. A glutton my ass. Of course, I left with my friends. We were planning on putting the world back on the right track.For someone like him who needed Ancient Powers, it was important to listen to stories about the ancient times. However, the story soon ended, and the spirit went back to talking about food and other useless things. Cale quickly cut it off.I don\u2019t think I could give up this taste even if I got fat. It\u2019s so unfair that I had to eat dirt and ended up dying!\u201cYes, it was an amazing and professional evaluation. You\u2019re a bit lou-\u201cThe spirit cut Cale off.You understand my evaluation. You are a really good guy! Thanks!\u2026Cale couldn\u2019t tell whether he could really communicate with the spirit or not.Cale really could not figure out the situation at hand. At least the voice stopped after telling him thanks. Called looked toward the tree in front of him.\u201cHow interesting.\u201dThe man-eating tree, the originally black man-eating tree, was starting to turn white. It then started to slowly grow some green leaves. The scene looked even more mystical because he was surrounded by fog right now.Ooooooooong-The noise held some heaviness compared to before. Cale kneeled on one side and sat down underneath the trunk of the tree. A bright white light was pouring out from the hole.Cale put his hand into the light. He then closed his eyes.\u2018This must be hit.\u2019A warm and strong power that wrapped around his hand. He started to smile before hearing the voice one more time. It was a pure and warm voice.It will protect you.Shiiiiiine.For a very short moment, a bright light wrapped around Cale. The light was silver in color, and the light started to become absorbed by his body. The absorbed light all gathered at Cale\u2019s heart.\u201cHuuuuuuuh.\u201dCale let out a long sigh as he opened his eyes. It did not hurt. It was warm, and the pure power was making him feel happy.Cale quickly lifted up the shirt that he was wearing.\u2018I did it.\u2019There was a small silver shield inscribed over his heart. It was different from a tattoo. Such a beautiful and fancy shield left its mark over Cale\u2019s heart.The shield will prioritize its owner\u2019s safety above anything else. The location of that promise was at the heart. This shield will be with Cale until his heart stops beating.\u201cHow nice.\u201dCale could feel the strength wrapping around his heart. It was not causing any issues. In fact, it felt like the shield had surrounded his heart, and was doing its best to protect him.Ancient Powers like this left their unique mark when they are activated.Cale quickly used the method that was written in the novel to trigger the Ancient Power.Paaaaaat.The \u2018Indestructible Shield\u2019 appeared in front of Cale\u2019s eyes.It was a silver shield that was just large enough to cover Cale\u2019s upper body. There were two silver wings on both sides of the shield, which allowed the shield to move within a certain radius from Cale. The size of the shield was also controllable.Cale started to control the size of this shield that already felt like it was a part of his body. This immediate familiarity was one of the special traits of Ancient Powers. That was why heroes used it, even if it was just as a support.Cale started to smile.\u2018A maximum of two times.\u2019Cale was thinking in terms of Choi Han, the strongest person around him right now. The shield should be able to block two of Choi Han\u2019s attacks.\u2018The strength of this shield is stronger than I expected. Why would the heroes not use it all the time?\u2019The Indestructible Shield, unlike its name, actually is capable of breaking. However, it does not disappear upon breaking. If the shield receives an attack stronger than its abilities, it will store as much of its strength as possible to protect the owner\u2019s heart before it breaks. After a while, the shield will recover its strength and can be used again. The strength of the shield comes from the owner\u2019s heart.The beating heart. That heart becomes the strength of the shield. The heart strengthens the shield while the shield protects the heart. So, what would happen if the heart gets stronger?\u2018It will get even stronger.\u2019There were many ways to strengthen Ancient Powers. Cale will be strengthening this shield on the way to the capital.Once that happens, he should be able to make a shield that can last 10, no, at least 5 minutes when someone of Choi Han\u2019s caliber tries to kill him with all of their strength.Ancient Powers, as seen with this man-eating tree, are difficult to earn unless you, \u2018coincidentally run into them.\u2019 The person who knows the most about these \u2018coincidences\u2019 in the first five volumes is probably Cale Henituse, well, the current Cale Henituse.Cale started to smile. He reached out and touched the shield. It felt nice. However, there was one thing he didn\u2019t like about it.\u201c\u2026It seems too divine.\u201dAt full strength, it looked like a Holy Shield that the Knights of God carry with their swords in myths.Of course, the former owner of this shield was a priestess who was tired of the term god, and the current owner, Cale, just didn\u2019t like gods.\u2018It\u2019s not like there will be many reasons for me to use this.\u2019He was planning on leaving the fighting to everyone else. The terror attack at the capital. He may have to use it if something dangerous happens there. But he will make sure it is small and faint so that other people will not notice it.Cale returned the shield to his heart and patted the now white tree as he started to walk away. The misty rain inside the fog started to wet Cale\u2019s shoulders.Cale liked the fog, but did not like rain. He started to walk faster toward home. He needed a carriage.It was at that moment.Meeoooooow.Meow.Cale suddenly felt a chill on the back of his neck. It was the alley right outside the Count\u2019s Estate. He could see two pairs of round, golden eyes. Cale started to frown.There were two kittens who looked extremely pitiful and drenched in the rain. They continued to meow as they approached Cale. They then started to rub their cheeks on Cale\u2019s legs.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale let out a sigh and started to walk. The two little kittens followed behind them. The tiny things somehow managed to keep up with Cale, even with their short legs.\u201cYoung master, what is going on?\u201dThe person who greeted Cale at home was deputy butler Hans. Hans had a confused expression as his eyes opened wide. He seemed to be shocked. Cale clicked his tongue and handed Hans the things in his hands.\u201cDon\u2019t ask stupid questions and just take them.\u201dHans\u2019s eyes started to shake.\u201cW, what cute and lovely kittens!\u201dThis deputy butler really did seem to be butler material. Cale carefully put the two kittens in the hands of the extremely excited Hans.The two kittens, that were dangling in Hans\u2019s hands, continued to look at Cale, even when they were in Hans\u2019s arms.\u201cYoung master, may I take care of these two lovely kitten-nims?\u201d\u201cWhatever you want.Hans started to smile in joy. Cale started to walk past the excited Hans as he added on.\u201cAh, for your information, they become quiet if you give them food. The two of them are also siblings.\u201dThe two kittens flinched and started to shake. Their golden eyes opened widely as they looked toward Cale.\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe moment Hans asked in confusion, Cale moved back toward Hans. He then lowered his head and caressed the two kittens.He had wondered about it for the last few days, but how could he not know by now?The silver kitten had a faint smell of the medicinal herbs he had given to the girl. When he picked the two kittens up earlier, he could also smell the beef steak and bacon cream pasta that he had given them this morning as well.That made Cale certain. The events of the last few days were finally resolved in Cale\u2019s head.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201dThe two kitten\u2019s golden eyes continued to shake. Cale looked at the siblings he had been feeding the last few days and started to smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tap. Even at the rough patting, the baby kittens could only stiffly stare at Cale. Cale thought about the moment when he first met Choi Han. The injured silver kitten was growling while the red kitten was whining next to it.\u2018The silver kitten should be the older sister with grey hair and the younger brother must be the red kitten.\u2019Cale had a bright smile on his face. He looked toward the kittens and started to speak.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201dThe siblings who seemed to be beast people avoided his gaze and Hans confusingly replied.\u201c...Are you talking to me?\u201d\u201cNot you.\u201dHans looked at Cale and the two kittens with an even more confused expression on his face, before holding the kittens even tighter. It was a movement that seemed to show that he was trying to avoid a dangerous person. However, he soon had to approach Cale once again.\u201cAre you heading back out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was because Cale changed his coat and was preparing to leave again.\u201cWhere will you be going?\u201d\u201cI have a promise to keep and someone to meet.\u201d\u201c...Young master, you are going to keep a promise?\u201dHans looked to be shocked again, as he questioned Cale.\u201cYou seem to be getting ruder.\u201d\u201cMy apologies.\u201dThe deputy butler\u2019s apology was very quick.\u2018Is he really the best of the butler candidates? He seemed decent by the way he handled Choi Han\u2019s issue.\u2019Cale felt like Hans, who was caressing the kittens with a wide grin on his face, was not very reliable.\u2018I\u2019m going to take him to the capital as well.\u2019Cale was thinking about this, something that Hans would never expect even in his dreams, no, something that Hans would lament even if he learned about it in his dream, before Cale asked about the person he had not seen for a while.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ron?\u201dHans had a satisfied smile on his face at that question.\u201cI heard that Choi Han-nim will be going with you as one of your guards for the beginning part of your journey to the capital. Is that true?\u201dHans was thinking about Choi Han, who had defeated all of the Count\u2019s Knight Brigade members today. He was more skilled than expected, making it easy for him to be Cale\u2019s guard as Cale wanted.Of course, neither Hans nor the knights knew that Choi Han had hidden his true power.\u201cMr. Ron found out that Choi Han-nim will be going with you and went out with Choi Han-nim to purchase some clothes and other necessary items for travel. Ah, Chef Beacrox went with them a well.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019m relieved.\u201d\u2018They seem to be getting along well.\u2019There was a rare, extremely bright smile on Cale\u2019s face. The smile was very fitting with his beautiful red hair. Hans started to speak while being happy about Cale\u2019s bright smile.\u201cMr. Ron, Choi Han-nim, and even Beacrox seem to be excited about serving you.\u201dHe could see an instantaneous change in Cale\u2019s face as he said that. Why would Cale suddenly look like he lost his appetite? Hans could not figure it out.Both individuals headed outside the main gates once again. As he got on the carriage, Cale asked Hans who was watching him leave.\u201cOh, Hans. Don\u2019t the deputy butlers learn basic martial arts?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAnd you are the greatest Butler candidate?\u201dThe corner of Hans\u2019s lips started to move up and down. Count Deruth cherished Hans because he took care of things well and had the best personality as well.\u201cYes sir. I know the basics for three different styles: martial arts, dagger arts, and spear arts.\u201dA good butler needed to learn a couple different basic fighting styles, just in case something happened and the family members needed to run away.\u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cI guess I am a bit amazing.\u201dCale could not hold back his smile watching Hans shrug his shoulders, while his lips continued to flicker. The two kittens could only shake their head as they watched Hans and the sly smile on Cale\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201dCale made up his mind to take Hans to the capital to take care of all annoying things he didn't want to deal with, and then closed the carriage door. The carriage headed into the fog and the now stronger rain to head to his destination.[The Fragrance of Tea with Poetry]Cale looked up at the sign before opening the door.Ring.The clear ringing of the bell and a desolate shop welcomed Cale.\u201cI guess nobody is here because of the rain.\u201d\u201cWelcome, young master.\u201dBillos. The bastard of the Flynn Merchant Guild. He welcomed Cale as if they had known each other for a long time. Cale sat in front of the counter and made eye contact with Billos.\u201cI promised to come back. I needed to keep my promise.\u201d\u201cOf course. Promises need to be kept. Should I prepare the book and tea from last time?\u201d\u201cYes. 3 cups of tea please.\u201d\u201cWhich teas should I make?\u201dCale ordered three types of tea and set a time for Billos to bring the teas up before turning around and heading up to the third floor.Drip drip-The rain was getting even worse. Tsk. Cale clicked his tongue and went back to sit at the same spot near the third floor window and looked out.\u201cThe rain is pretty strong, isn\u2019t it?\u201dBillos came up and sat across from him and put down a single cup of tea. Cale was observing Billos closely.\u2018Choi Han, Beacrox, Ron. And finally, Billos.\u2019These were the names of the individuals who continued to show up in the novel past volume 1. Of course, Billos only has about two sentences written about him in volume 1, as the owner of the tea shop that Choi Han stops by to rest. He returns in volume 3 to swear his loyalty to Choi Hand and reveal his ambitions.\u2018Reveal.\u2019 That word was important.\u2018He\u2019s always been a greedy person.\u2019Billos was different from Hong Gil-dong.\u00a0[1]He was not sad that he could not call his father, \u2018father,\u2019 or his brother, \u2018brother.\u2019 In fact, he was just trying to beat them.He wanted to make it so that they had no choice but to accept him. He wanted to create a situation where they will have no choice but to introduce him as son, to introduce him as the younger brother.\u2018He must be exhausted.\u2019Cale thought Billos lived an exhausting life. However, he did not hate that. In fact, having that type of greed made him seem more human.He didn\u2019t like the people who had the abilities and strength, but said things like, \u2018Hoho, I\u2019m just going to give up. I have no choice.\u2019 Why would you give up on something that could be yours? You should always take what is yours.Anyways, this person had to meet with Choi Han at least once during the time frame of volume 1. It had to just be a short encounter.Cale could hear Billos\u2019s voice breaking his train of thought.\u201cYoung master, I heard that you are going to head to the capital.\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep sitting there? Don\u2019t you have work to do?\u201dSeeing Cale pretending to be annoyed made Billos smile. He did not even try to hide it. This really was a very, very interesting young master. However, Billos could tell that he had a pretty sharp mind.\u201cI will be heading to the capital as well. I guess I will be following after you.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dCale already knew about it.In order for Billos and Choi Han to have an encounter in volume 3, Billos needed to head for the capital soon as well.Billos had a stoic expression as he asked Cale, who was sipping his tea and looking out the window, a question.\u201cYoung master, it seems like you have changed.\u201dSeeing Cale turn to look at him, Billos started to smile. Cale motioned with his chin for Billos to continue.\u201cYou seem different than your nickname.\u201d\u201cWhich one? Trash?\u201dBillos could see the corners of Cale\u2019s lips starting to go up. He definitely was different. This Cale was not the trash that he knew about. That trash did not know how to make such an expression. It was a slightly bitter smile.\u2018...Should I have gotten a bit drunk and broken a chair or something?\u2019Billos did not know what Cale was thinking.\u201cYes. You are right. Trash. Haven\u2019t you always been a trashy young master?\u201dDid he not have any fear? Cale could not help but wonder, as Billos said such a thing to the Count\u2019s son, the first born of the ruler of the territory. Was Billos the one who had something to drink?But Cale did not want to fight with Billos. Billos was someone who was going to take over a large merchant guild. And Billos was being sincere. He was not smiling, he was actually sincerely asking the question.\u2018Haven\u2019t you always been a trashy young master?\u2019Cale decided to answer the question. It was not a hard question to answer anyways. It was easier than figuring out how to make money when you have no money.\u201cBillos.\u201dCale had a smile on his face, but did not laugh as he called out to Billos.\u201cYou can\u2019t call your father, \u2018father.\u2019 You can\u2019t call your brother, \u2018brother.\u2019\u201dBillos\u2019s gaze turned chilly. He started to take notice of the young master in front of him who had no problem touching his sore spot. Just like he had touched Cale\u2019s sore spot, he was returning the favor by touching his most painful sore spot. Cale just silently made eye contact with Billos for a bit.The rain started to pour even harder outside. Cale broke the silence and started to smile as he asked.\u201cAre you going to keep being the bastard? Are you satisfied with that?\u201dBillos could feel Cale\u2019s sharp gaze on him.\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201dCale leaned back on the chair and continued on with an expression that seemed to be thinking about the past.\u201cI\u2019ve acted like a trash for about ten years, since I started when I was 8.\u201d\u2018Wow. Now that I think about it, Cale Henituse has been doing trashy things since he was 8 years old. He started drinking when he was 15. What a guy.\u2019Cale thought about the past of the original Cale that was present in his mind, and started to smile. That smile looked scary to Billos.At that moment, a small noise cut through the rain to reach Cale and Billos.Squeak. Squeak. It was the sound of someone coming up the stairs.Cale looked past Billos\u2019s shoulder to the entrance of the third floor. He could see someone\u2019s head. Black hair. It was Choi Han. Behind him was Ron. Cale had told a servant to tell Choi Han to come to this tea shop later in the day.Cale moved his gaze away from the two of them, and started to speak to finish his conversation with Billos. Choi Han and Ron finished coming up the stairs and looked toward Cale as he started to speak.\u201cBillos.\u201dBillos\u2019s stoic face felt pretty chilly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to throw away something you\u2019ve been doing for around ten years.\u201dCale\u2019s eyes started to look more alive as he continued.\u201cI can\u2019t live as a trash forever.\u201dOf course, Cale would still spend all the money he wants and do whatever pleases him, even if he wasn\u2019t a trash. He was going to live peacefully and enjoy life as the son of a rich noble. Although that was different than the direction of Billos\u2019s life, what mattered was that both of them were not going to continue living the way they had been living.\u201cAren\u2019t you the same?\u201dThe corner of Billos\u2019s lips started to slowly move upward. He then bowed and started to snicker.After silently snickering for a bit, Billos raised his head up and looked toward Cale.\u201cI am indeed tired of it.\u201dBillos was laughing as he said he was tired of it.\u201cSee? I told you.\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders and motioned for Choi Han and Ron to come over. At that moment, Billos got up from the seat and started to speak.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI will see you at the capital.\u201dCale started to frown. It would be complicated if they met at the capital right away.\u201cWhy bother?\u201dCale motioned for Billos to go away, and Billos respectfully bowed before leaving. Ron, Choi Han, and the descending Billos made eye contact, but they all just ignored each other.\u2018Good.\u2019Cale welcomed that scene. Choi Han and Billos just barely ran into each other. It was just like in the book. Cale started to smile at the other two people with satisfaction.\u201cRon, I knew you would come with him. According to Hans, Beacrox went with you too, but I presume he went back to the kitchen. He has a strong sense of responsibility for that kitchen.\u201d\u201cYoung master, are you close with that person?\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders at the unexpected question from Ron.\u201cNo?\u201d\u201c...I see.\u201dCale pushed it aside as nothing important, but Ron definitely heard it. He heard Cale say that he cannot keep living as a trash. Cale stopped looking at Ron whose response trailed of and made eye contact with Choi Han.\u201cI guess you can\u2019t trust the rumors.\u201d\u2018What the hell is he saying?\u2019Cale ignored Choi Han\u2019s words. At that moment, Billos brought up the other two cups of tea that Cale had ordered earlier.\u201cShould I give these cups to these two gentlemen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale started to smile again.\u201cI ordered them in advance.\u201dCale personally picked up the teacups and put one in front of each person. In front of Choi Han was the tea he just randomly ordered from the menu. As for Ron.\u201cI specially ordered this for you since it seems like you like it a lot. Why else would you bring it for me everyday?\u201dIt was warm lemon tea. Cale could see Ron looking odd and felt the biggest satisfaction he had felt all day.1. Hong Gil-dong was a Korean outlaw during the Joseon Dynasty who had a similar story of being an illegitimate sonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: Picked It Up (6)But behind that satisfaction, Cale suddenly felt chills on the back of his neck. It was because Ron drank the lemon tea without any complaints.Clack.Why did the sound of the teacup being placed on the table feel so loud? Thankfully, it was not just Cale being paranoid. Choi Han, who had been quietly enjoying his tea, started to frown.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you enjoy your tea a little more quietly?\u201dRon held back his laughter after seeing Choi Han take a peek at Cale before speaking in a more respectful tone to him. Today, he had found a decently useful sword for Choi Han. It was a sword made by the same blacksmith as the one who made Beacrox\u2019s cooking knife.\u2018Want to try it out?\u2019\u2018I will not fight against someone who is trying to cut someone else with a cooking knife.\u2019His son, Beacrox, kept nagging Choi Han to fight him with that sword. It was because Beacrox learned a bit about Choi Han\u2019s strength from that short bout last time, and wanted to find out more. However, Choi Han continued to reject him.\u2018Ho, what a funny punk. What, do I need to bring a bloodied sword like you?\u2019Choi Han closed his eyes for a moment before opening them back up and responded to Beacrox as if he was confirming it for himself.\u2018I, I will now be someone who protects. He said even I could do it.\u2019\u2018What the heck are you saying?\u2019Ron watched his son and Choi Han\u2019s cute bickering, before following Choi Han to come see Cale. He didn\u2019t expect to hear such a precious thing.\u2018I can\u2019t live as a trash forever.\u2019That was what Ron was thinking about as he drank the lemon tea. But it looked like he was glaring at Choi Han. Cale was watching that scene with satisfaction.Ron and Choi Han\u2019s relationship in \u2018The Birth of a Hero\u2019 was just like this. They were always at each other\u2019s throats, but still continued to travel together. They were tied together by a contract, but they both knew they could also rely on one another.Cale thought that a lot of things got twisted because of his actions to not get beaten up, but it looked like their relationship was forming in a similar manner.\u2018It is disappointing that it got twisted a bit, but my life comes first. I can\u2019t let the novel dictate my life.\u2019For Cale, his life was the first priority. After that, it was that everybody living within his territory lived peacefully. What else could you need?\u201cSweet teas are really the best.\u201dRon flinched at the words that Cale happily said.The tea time for these three individuals ended in the middle of the downpour.\u201cI guess the next time I will see you will be at the capital.\u201dCale shook his head toward Billos, who greeted Cale as he came down from the third floor after tea time.\u201cI will be coming here everyday for a while.\u201d\u201cIs that so? To read the book?\u201d\u201cWhatever I feel like doing.\u201d\u201cPlease feel free to visit whenever you would like. This tea shop is open to you at all times young master.\u201dBillos was watching Cale, who walked by while pretending not to hear what he said, with curiosity. Ron was just quietly observing them from behind.The bastard son of the Flynn Merchant Guild. The fact that he was extremely talented made the official children resent him. That was why Billos had to come to this remote, yet profitable region in the Henituse territory.He couldn\u2019t even use the family name of, \u2018Flynn,\u2019 either.Ron was observing Cale being friendly with this greedy Billos and clicked his tongue. It was because he thought to himself, \u2018Why does it matter to me if that puppy young master is close to Billos?\u2019\u201cTsk. I guess even dislike creates affection.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want my dislike of you to turn into affection.\u201dRon let out a sigh after seeing that the clueless Choi Han had misunderstood.\u201cNot you, punk.\u201dRon\u2019s gaze was on Cale.Ron was planning on heading to the capital anyways. It was because he had a bad feeling about it. He had been thinking about it countless times ever since Choi Han came out from the Forest of Darkness and entered the city with that dense murderous aura on him.The reason Ron had to hide out in this territory. The reason he had to escape from the Eastern Continent. It looked like he needed to research the people responsible for it one more time.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate for me to make sure our puppy young master safely arrives at the capital and safely leaves as my final duty as his servant?\u2019He claimed to others while laughing that he would be by the young master\u2019s side because he found Cale\u2019s scared expression to be funny, but would an assassin ever tell the truth to others?\u2018I should tell Beacrox to make food that our little puppy young master will like during the journey.\u2019Cale was someone he looked after even more than his own son, Beacrox. Ron knew very well about the terrible things Cale has done, and the terrible personality that Cale had. However, there was someone else he knew.Ron remembered how the young Cale had consoled his father when his mother died. He also saw how Cale hated his stepmother and her family, but never caused a ruckus with them, even when he was drunk.\u2018But he definitely is still trash, tsk.\u201918 years. Ron had watched over Cale for too long.***Cale returned to his chamber immediately after returning to the estate, only to find the two baby kittens staring up at him.\u201cAh, I forgot about the two of you.\u201dHe should have brought Choi Han, who cherishes small animals. Choi Han had returned to his own room after saying that his heart needed to become stronger to be someone who protects.When Cale laughed and asked who Choi Han was going to protect, Choi Han responded that he would let Cale know once he became stronger. That answer gave Cale the chills. Cale didn\u2019t know why someone as strong as Choi Han would want to become even stronger.\u201cYoung master.\u201dHans approached Cale as he was staring at the kittens.\u201cYoung master, what do you think? Aren\u2019t they even cuter, lovelier, and more adorable now? They are so mean though, they wouldn\u2019t even let me pet them. Haha!\u201dHans crouched next to the kittens and looked up at Cale with satisfaction. His expression was so full of admiration that it surprised Cale and Ron. His expression was not related to the cuteness of the kittens.\u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201dThis strong butler candidate seems to like cats very much.\u201cOh, um, I guess so.\u201dThe two kittens, that were sitting on a silk cushion that came from who knows where, definitely looked fuller and healthier. What kind of magic did this deputy butler do in that short amount of time? However, the two kittens continued to avoid Hans\u2019s gaze. It seemed to be a very stereotypical relationship between a butler and a cat.\u201cThen I will be heading out now, young master. Please call me if there is anything you need for the kitten-nims.\u201d\u201cJust go.\u201dAfter verifying that Ron got Hans to leave, Cale avoided the sparkling eyes of the kittens as he went into the bathroom. At that moment, the kittens\u2019 ears fell down.But then.\u201cHooo.\u201dRon approached the kittens after getting Hans to leave. Only Ron and the two baby kittens were currently in the bedroom.\u201cYou are children of the Cat Tribe.\u201dThe golden eyes of the kitten\u2019s turned sharp. However, Ron did not seem to care, as he verified that the bathroom door was closed before standing in front of the kittens.\u201cGood.\u201dThere was an odd smile on Ron\u2019s face.The Cat Tribe was known for their sensitivity to their surroundings. The Cat Tribe was one that was better known in the Eastern Continent than the Western Continent, but there was no way that someone like Ron, who was involved with assassinations, would not know about them.Unlike most beast people, who became violent when they went berserk, the Cat Tribe became stealthier and sharper. That was why they were a scary tribe, although they were not at the level of the Wolf, Tiger, or Lion Tribes.There was only one thought on Ron\u2019s mind as he watched the two Cat Tribe children. It was a sudden thought, and they were still young, but\u2026\u2018I can teach them.\u2019Ron checked to make sure that the door to the bathroom was closed once again.The Cat Tribe put a lot of importance on relationships. If they trust someone once, they will never betray them. They were suspicious by nature, but, like the Wolf Tribe, they valued interpersonal relationships.Children of such a tribe came looking for Cale on their own accord. Ron thought it would be nice to give his puppy young master a farewell present.Ron moved a bit closer to the Cat Tribe children. He then reached out to caress the head of the slightly larger silver kitten.Slap.The silver kitten slapped his hand away and quickly moved away to the corner of the room along with the red kitten.\u201cHoo.\u201dRon\u2019s eyes turned curious. These Cat Tribe children seem to have already figured him out. It made sense, since they needed to quickly recognize people like him, people who were close with death, in order to live for a long time. Even if cats do have nine lives, they needed to treasure them. The Cat Tribe was known for their long lives as well as their stealthy night movement. In this regard, they were stealthier than anyone else. Ron started to smile.\u201cOne child is fog and the other one is poison.\u201dThe silver one was fog and the red one was blood, or poison. Even if they did not become killers, they had the right foundations to become shadows. THe silver kitten turned its head away as Ron said that, while the red kitten snorted. The two siblings had no desire to become killers who gave off such a thick scent of death.The two kittens scoffed at Ron, as if they knew about his identity as an assassin already. Once Cale came out of the bathroom, they were still sticking very close to each other as they looked up at Cale.\u201cStop looking at me.\u201dThey immediately stopped looking at him once he said that.\u201cRon. Go get me my meal from Beacrox.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dRon left and Cale sat down on the couch and looked toward the two kittens. He then spoke to the two kittens who were whining in a corner far away from him.\u201cYou two are part of the Cat Tribe, aren\u2019t you?\u201dThe two kittens nodded their heads without making eye contact with Cale.\u201cAre you planning on following me?\u201dThere were no responses to this question.Instead, the red kitten slowly walked over and rubbed its cheek on Cale\u2019s leg, while the silver kitten approached Cale soon after and started to tap Cale\u2019s foot with her front paw.Cale already had a plan for these two siblings. He nodded his head and made up his mind about the kittens.\u201cThen make yourselves useful.\u201dThe kittens immediately responded.Meeeow.Meow!\u201cAnswer in human language.\u201dThe pupils of the silver kitten, the older sister named On, started to sparkle as she spoke.\u00a0[1]\u201cI want to eat meat. I\u2019m still hungry.\u201dThe red kitten, the younger brother Hong, tapped Cale\u2019s leg as he added on.\u00a0[2]\u201cI want to eat cake.\u201dCale responded to both of them.\u201cI will give you a lot of meat and cake, so you know what to do, right?\u201d\u201cBe useful!\u201d\u201cBe useful!\u201dThe kittens immediately replied, and that was how the two siblings, who were kicked out of the Fog Cat Tribe, became a part of of Count Henituse\u2019s household.Four days later, Cale joined his family for breakfast for the first time in a while. Count Deruth looked at his son, who was wearing extremely simple clothes, and started to smile.\u201cI guess you are leaving today.\u201dToday was the day that Cale would leave the Henituse territory and head toward the capital.1. There are many Chinese characters for \u201cOn,\u201d but I think the author is referencing the, \u201cOn,\u201d that means conceal, because she is the fog that Ron describes.2. The name \u201cHong\u201d is probably from the Chinese character for Red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14: Heading Out (1)\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you are nervous.\u201dCale smiled instead of responding to his father\u2019s statement. Cale\u2019s complexion had gotten much better in the last few days. It had no choice but to get better.\u2018Since I didn\u2019t get beaten to a pulp.\u2019It was raining in the Henituse territory until yesterday. If the story went as it did in the novel, Cale would have been beaten to a pulp on a rainy day. Of course, Cale was not beaten up yesterday.He could also sleep well now. This was because he could feel the Indestructible Shield always surrounding his heart. Knowing that he could manage to survive, even if he did something wrong to someone like Ron or Beacrox, made it easier for him to sleep at night.\u201cFather.\u201dCale looked at the breakfast spread that was fancier than ever before, as he asked.\u201cIt looks like the number of people in the envoy has grown again. I asked you to reduce the number.\u201dHe had asked his father to decrease the number of servants accompanying him to help with his needs. He said that Hans and Ron were enough. Of course, Hans turned pale at first, however, he started to pack right away after hearing that the kittens will be traveling with them as well.\u201cAh, about that...\u201dFor some reason, Deruth stopped his sentence without finishing. At that moment, someone else\u2019s voice interjected itself into their conversation.\u201cThat was my decision.\u201dIt was the Count\u2019s wife, Violan.Her hair was perfectly formed in a bun, without a single stray hair, as she was looking down at her plate. She looked so similar to her son, Basen. Even the way they both did not make eye contact with Cale and had a stoic expression was the same.\u201cWe can\u2019t have someone from our family looking poor and terrible just because you want to go with such a small envoy.\u201dIt was an extremely stoic voice. Violan then lifted up her gaze to look in Cale\u2019s direction before continuing on.\u201c\u2026 I am not saying you are terrible.\u201d\u201cEven I know that much.\u201dViolan hesitated for a moment after hearing Cale\u2019s response, before taking another bite of her food and continuing to speak.\u201cPeople, especially nobles, care a lot about appearances.\u201dThe Countess Violan. Cale quietly watched her.She was born as the eldest daughter of a poor artist\u2019s family, and had dreamt about being the head of a merchant guild when she grew up. She was influenced by the luxury items being sold to the nobles and came to the Henituse territory. Once she got here, she fell in love with the art of sculpting.Eventually, she met Count Deruth and fell in love, living as the director for the territory\u2019s cultural business operations.In Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s opinion, she had a lot of pride for herself and her life, which was why she had a lot of pride for this family as well.Even though she knew that Cale was silently observing her, she continued on without a single change in her expression.\u201cArt is not for those human tras- mm.\u201d (cut off without the h on purpose)She was a bit of a coarse speaker because she worked in the merchant world for a while.\u201cAnyways, there are a lot of people who think that appearances reveal everything about a person.\u201dThat was her way of telling Cale to take a lot of servants with him. Her goal was for Cale to not be judged negatively just because he only took a few servants with him.Naturally, Cale wanted to take a lot of people to do his biddings for him as well.\u2018How nice and relaxing would it be?\u2019He was finding it difficult to get changed without a servant now. Kim Rok Soo had been in this world as Cale for only about a week, but he already could not let go of that easy life.However, a few days into Cale\u2019s future was a crazy Black Dragon.If he cannot release this crazy dragon in advance, it might go wild and kill a lot of people. Although Cale didn\u2019t care about what happened to other people, he still did not want to see people dying in front of his eyes.Furthermore, he also didn\u2019t want to take responsibility for those people who will be injured because of the dragon.Responsibility was a heavy burden, and for someone like Kim Rok Soo, who had taken responsibility for his own life since he was a young boy, he knew that responsibility related to people and people\u2019s lives was the scariest and heaviest burden.That was why he started to speak.\u201cArt is the mirror of the soul.\u201dViolan lifted her gaze off of her plate and looked toward Cale. This was the first time in a long while that the two of them had made eye contact with each other.\u201c\u2026You do know about that.\u201d\u201cYes. I do know.\u201dCale had roamed around the entire territory the last four days to prepare the things he needed on this trip. He just recited one of the things he saw on one of those trips.\u201cSculpting is not just cutting into a chunk of marble. It is creating a reflection of what is in your heart.\u201dThis time, it was Cale who looked at his plate and continued to eat while Violan was watching him.\u201cI read that on the plaque at the Gallery.\u201dThe Gallery in the Henituse territory displayed the works of new sculptors. That statement that was written on the plaque in the Gallery was something that Violan had personally written.\u201c\u2026Do as you wish. I will reduce the number of people going with you, but, in return, the carriage and everything in it shall be of the highest quality. That is how it should be for us Henituse people.\u201d\u201cThat is fine with me. Please give me the most expensive stuff.\u201d\u201cGreat. I will make sure you have a carriage that won\u2019t even hurt your butt as you travel across bumpy roads.\u201d\u201cOnly the best.\u201dCale could not see it because he was looking at his plate, but there was a slight smile on Violan\u2019s face, before it disappeared. Count Deruth, who had been watching this from the start, let out a fake cough to cover up his slowly rising smile, and asked Cale.\u201cDid you verify the information from Hans regarding the personalities of all the nobles who will be going to the capital?\u201dDeruth had used his own network, as well as the information guild to purchase information on the other nobles, and had handed it to Hans to give to Cale.\u201cYes. It was pretty entertaining.\u201dIt was probably difficult to purchase that file. In fact, it probably cost a fortune. Although it only had about three or four lines about each person, it was precious and expensive to purchase information on nobles.\u201cThere are some petty ones, some stupid ones, some smart and scary ones, even some who are desperate for power. Looks like all sorts of people are coming this time.\u201dOf course, there were also some stupidly nice people, villains, and trash as well.\u201cYou read the file I sent you. Ahem. Anyways, do as you please. But Cale.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u201cI heard a strange rumor.\u201dCale\u2019s shoulders flinched just ever so slightly.\u201cApparently the man-eating tree, that black tree, has changed. It is now a white three with beautiful blue leaves. There are even grass growing in that spot where nothing used to grow.\u201dThe place that had changed the most in the last four days was none other than the top of the hill in the slums. It was a location where only the black tree had resided, however, that tree turned white with blue leaves after Cale had resolved its grudge, and it was now beautiful tree that looked almost divine.\u201cIsn\u2019t it an interesting rumor?\u201d\u201cIt is. What an interesting rumor.\u201dCale had no intentions of revealing his Ancient Power right now, so he simply pretended to have no knowledge of it.There was no way that Count Deruth did not know about the fact that he went to the slums. However, he would not have any knowledge of the Ancient Power. He would just suspect that something happened with Cale and the man-eating tree.\u201cYes, but it isn\u2019t that big of a deal. However, you need to pay attention to rumors no matter what you do. There is nothing scarier than human eyes and mouths. However, anything that happens inside the territory is fine for members of our household.\u201d\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201dCale felt like he really could live a peaceful life, as long as he remained in their territory. How great would it be to quickly come back from the capital and live the life of a couch potato?The luxurious breakfast that was made for Cale, who was leaving for the capital, finally came to an end. He received goodbyes from the Count and Countess, who couldn\u2019t watch him leave because they had work to do, and then made eye contact with his siblings, who were awkwardly standing there.\u201cWhat?\u201dHis younger brother, Basen, just shook his head at Cale\u2019s question. His younger sister, Lily, slowly approached him. 7 years old. This youngest sibling of his was 11 years apart from him.\u201cP, please have a safe trip.\u201d\u201cThanks. You be safe here too.\u201dLily vigorously nodded her head.\u201cYes!\u201dShe then quietly looked at Cale. Cale just casually asked in response to her gaze.\u201cShould I buy you a present while on my trip?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u2018As I thought. She wanted a present.\u2019Cale nodded his head as he watched the surprised, amazed, and happy expression all taking turns showing up on Lily\u2019s face.\u201cYes. What would you like?\u201d\u201cA sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cPlease buy me a sword.\u201d\u2018A 7 year old wants a sword?\u2019Seeing the shock on Cale\u2019s face, Basen started to speak.\u201cHyung-nim, Lily\u2019s dream these days is to become a swordsman.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCale seriously looked toward Lily. The people of this household all had long arms, long legs, and a good physique. Lily was only 7 years old, but she was tall for her age and could easily become a good swordsman if she put in the effort.\u201cI guess it would suit her.\u201dLily\u2019s eyes started to sparkle.\u201cI will buy you an expensive one.\u201dLily started to smile as she lowered her head in embarrassment instead of responding. Cale did not see this, as he looked toward his 15 year old younger brother, who was looking at him.\u201cYou want something too?\u201d\u201cA fountain pen.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dThe breakfast came to an end once he got the list of presents from his siblings.***Cale\u2019s expression was odd as he stood in front of the carriage that would take him to the carriage.\u2018How odd.\u2019He had an odd expression as he asked the person standing next to him.\u201cWhy is it that their seat is better than my seat?\u201dCale was looking at the expensive and soft cushion next to him, as well as the two kittens sitting on the cushion.\u201cYoung master, shouldn\u2019t our precious cats travel comfortably on this trip? They are so small and precious.\u201dHans answered as he put the special treats he prepared for the cats in the carriage as well. Cale and Ron both had blank expressions on their faces.\u2018It\u2019s because he has not seen them create fog and fill it with poison.\u2019Cale called On and Hong to a empty corner of the garden three days ago.\u2018What can you do?\u2019In response to his question, On created fog while in her cat form, while Hong used a bit of his blood to spread poison into the air. Of course, On was able to control the poisonous fog to prevent Cale from dying. Furthermore, the poison Hong could spread was only at the level of paralysis right now.\u2018You two are quite useful.\u2019On and Hong proudly answered back after hearing Cale\u2019s praise.\u2018We were able to run away because of our poisonous fog!\u2019\u2018We are quite useful!\u2019Starting from that day, On and Hong were able to eat delicious food all day long. Naturally, Hans was happy to provide for them.\u201cYoung master, I will be sitting with the driver up top.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRon jumped up next to the driver, and Cale was about to board as well, when Choi Han approached him.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dChoi Han said that he did not want to call Cale young master, instead choosing to call him Cale-nim.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it okay for me to not be in the same carriage protecting you?\u201dCale\u2019s expression turned like he had eaten some bitter persimmon.\u201c\u2026Is there\u2026\u201d\u2018Is there a reason to do that?\u2019That was what Cale\u2019s expression was saying, and Choi Han didn\u2019t say anything else, instead just nodding his head. Cale started to squint his eyes while watching Choi Han walk away.\u2018It\u2019s really weird.\u2019Choi Han\u2019s eyes were still not very clear. His mind still seemed to be full of anger and thoughts of revenge. When Cale mentioned yesterday that they had sent people to Harris Village, he could see the anger in Choi Han\u2019s eyes.But he felt a little different than before. He wasn\u2019t in complete despair like in the novel, thinking something along the lines of, \u2018The world does not want me to be happy! How could they kill all of my loved ones?!\u2019 That was why it was weird.\u2018He recovered pretty quickly.\u2019He seemed to be at the stage in the novel when he was traveling with Beacrox, Rosalyn, and Lock, with a sword in his heart but a calm demeanor on the outside.\u00a0[1]\u00a0He let it be since it wasn\u2019t bad, but Cale had an oddly bitter feeling in his mouth. It was at that moment.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is your spot.\u201dThe leader of the envoy, the Vice Captain of the territory\u2019s Knight Brigade, approached Choi Han and started to speak. The Vice Captain looked at Choi Han from head to though before smirking, like he was looking down at Choi Han.\u2018I knew we would have at least one person like this.\u2019Cale clicked his tongue.Choi Han had hidden his abilities to that of an average level.The problem was that Choi Han was the first person Cale brought to the Count\u2019s Estate as a guest, and the fact that Count Deruth treated him like an important guest.Adding on the fact that he was going as part of Cale\u2019s guards this time made some people start to dislike and oppose him.They didn\u2019t annoy him visibly because he was still Cale\u2019s guest, but there were a lot of things they were secretly doing to annoy Choi Han.\u2018Young master, I do not think Choi Han-nim is getting along with the other knights who will be going with us to the capital.\u2019\u2018Is that so?\u2019\u2018Yes. I think the Vice Captain is responsible for it.\u2019\u2018I got it Hans. You can stop worrying about it.\u2019Cale thought about Hans\u2019s report and felt bad, not for Choi Han, but for the Vice Captain.\u2018Soon enough, he\u2019ll realize that his eyes were not just at the ground, but completely underground.\u2019\u00a0[2]It\u2019ll be fine as long as he doesn\u2019t do anything to get beaten up.Cale did not choose to try to resolve their issues.The Vice Captain will not be able to sleep properly once he sees Choi Han\u2019s real skills. How could he sleep when he is extremely scared?\u201cYoung master, shall we leave now?\u201dThe Vice Captain asked Cale,and Cale closed the carriage door as he answered.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go.\u201d15 soldiers, 5 knights, and one special guard. Cale\u2019s envoy, which consisted of this protection squad and then some other people, finally started to head toward the capital.Of course, as with most fantasy world travels, it was not a very uneventful trip.Nobody dared to touch Cale\u2019s carriage in the Henituse territory. The carriage did not have the flag that represented the family, but the carriage itself had the Golden Turtle, the symbol of the Henituse family, drawn on it. It was representative of the Henituse family\u2019s love for wealth and longevity.However, as soon as they left the Henituse territory, they ran into a situation.\u2018As expected, they really do show up.\u2019While they were rushing through a mountain range, tens of people suddenly showed up in the valley.\u201cPay the toll if you want to cross this mountain!\u201d\u201cTake out everything you have! If we found anything after you claim to have taken everything out, it will be 1 slap for every 1 bronze we find!\u201dYes, it was the bandits.There were bound to be bandits in a fantasy story, but the fact that there were tens of them was surprising. They probably relied on their numbers to attack this carriage, which only had 5 knights. Cale looked toward the kitten On, who was yawning and asked.\u201cYou think they can\u2019t see the symbol on my carriage?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cIdiots! Beginners!\u201dCale nodded his head at Hong\u2019s assessment. He was not afraid of bandits. Why would he be?Knock Knock.The knocking came from the small window by the driver\u2019s seat before the window slightly opened, and Ron looked inside.\u201cYoung master, it looks like we will need to take a break. There seem to be quite a lot of rabbits here.\u201dRabbits. Cale shook for a moment. Ron went, \u2018Ah!\u2019 before smiling and added on.\u201cAh, this rabbit is different from the rabbit I was going to catch for you, young master. Of course, these rabbits will not be caught by me but by other people.\u201dCale was being protected by someone who was scarier than the bandits. He listened to the sound of the bandits\u2019 screams coming from outside the carriage, as he started to calculate the time.\u201cAbout a day and a half.\u201dIn about a day and a half, they would arrive around the area where the Black Dragon was being tortured. It was earlier than when Choi Han arrived in the novel. This was the reason he had made them rush forward without taking any breaks.1. Looking really calm even though he still has a strong desire for revenge internally.2. Been really blind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was because of the delicious smell filling the area.\u2018The joy of the day comes from eating a delicious dinner.\u2019That was what Cale was thinking. A warm dinner was the signal to end the long and tiring day, and start a relaxing night.\u00a0Tonight\u2019s main course was a soup with rabbit meat.\u201cDamn it.\u201dIt was not Ron\u2019s doing. Cale turned his gaze to the side. Choi Han, the person who had caught the rabbits, was happily eating his soup.Meeeeow.Tap. Tap. On and Hong were tapping on his leg, asking him to give it to them if he didn\u2019t want it. Hans had a wide smile on his face as he cautiously approached the two children.\u201cWould our precious kitten-nims like to eat the jerky that I prepared for you? It is very healthy, without any salt or preservatives.\u201dNaturally, On and Hong ignored Hans. Hans, who did not know they were part of the Cat Tribe, found that sass to be cute as well and continued to linger around them.Contrary to the fact that they had their first battle, it was a very relaxed and peaceful environment. However, the atmosphere around the knights seemed to be a bit odd. They kept peeking toward Choi Han, who was eating his soup next to Cale. The Vice Captain seemed to be full of agony.\u201cTsk.\u201dCale clicked his tongue.Cale\u2019s party had to fight off tens of bandits today. The one to handle most of those bandits was naturally Choi Han. He did not kill the bandits. However, he had no issues cutting off a limb or leaving them a deep scar. Not only that, he did it in an unbelievable speed too.\u2018Young master, the battle is over.\u2019The Vice Captain had reported this to Cale with a shocked expression on his face. He had not expected it to end so quickly.\u00a0The bandits were ones who were pushed out of power in a different area nearby. The bandits they had thought were stupid were at their limits and felt that they could handle five knights because of their numbers.Unfortunately, their first target ended up being Cale\u2019s carriage with Choi Han.\u00a0The reason the Vice Captain\u2019s face was completely pale was not because of the strength of the bandits. Choi Han approached next to the Vice Captain and added on.\u2018It was a light battle. Not even enough for a warm-up.\u2019Cale could see the Vice Captain slightly flinch after hearing Choi Han\u2019s words. He could also see Choi Han smirking while looking at the Vice Captain flinch.\u2018He really isn\u2019t the type to let people do as they please with him.\u2019There was no way that someone like Choi Han, who had no issues beating up the Count\u2019s son, would be nice and let people just continue to mess with him.\u201cDo you have no appetite?\u201dCale seemed to be frustrated, as Ron approached him with his usual benign smile. He looked back and forth between the rabbit soup and Ron, before suddenly realizing something. This old man enjoyed making fun of him.\u201cYes. None at all.\u201dChoi Han responded to that statement.\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d\u2018I would have no issues if you caught anything other than rabbits.\u2019Cale looked toward Choi Han, and waved his hand to tell Choi Han to not mind him.However, Choi Han continued to look toward Cale with a serious gaze.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201c...Was that you first time experiencing a battle?\u201dCale just casually responded back to Choi Han who asked with a serious expression.\u201cWhat battle? You mean with the bandits earlier?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve never seen so many bandits before.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dChoi Han nodded his head and quietly mumbled to himself.\u201c...Must have been your first time facing potential death.\u201dHa. One of the soldiers let out a gasp.Ha! Cale let out a loud gasp as if he was completely shocked.\u2018First time facing potential death my ass. Do you know how nervous I\u2019ve been the last few days because of you?\u2019That wasn\u2019t even it. Ron\u2019s smile as Choi Han brought back the rabbits, the sight of Beacrox sharpening his cooking knife, Cale was also nervous because of them. Cale started to think about all of the nervous moments he has had since they left the Henituse territory.\u2018Now I really have no appetite.\u2019He had lost all of his appetite. Clang. The spoon in Cale\u2019s hand just fell onto the soup bowl. That was why he didn\u2019t realize that the soldiers were looking at him with an understanding gaze, or that Choi Han had stopped paying attention to everyone around him as he nostalgically thought about the past.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCale was thinking about how he didn\u2019t need to be so nervous anymore because he managed to avoid getting beaten up and also got the Indestructible Shield, when Choi Han\u2019s voice snapped him back to reality.\u2018Why does he keep talking to me?\u2019\u201cThe first time is always difficult to handle.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dAs Cale stoically asked back, Choi Han had a slight smile on his face before he asked in a stoic expression. The gaze in his eyes was extremely serious.\u201cCale-nim, do you not study any martial arts?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least have the strength to protect yourself?\u201dThere was concern in that seriousness. Cale wondered why Choi Han was suddenly becoming so serious, but decided to answer the question anyways.\u201cI have plenty of ways already.\u201dCale took his gaze off of Choi Han and looked around. 15 soldiers who were stronger than him, and 5 knights who would do well no matter where they went. There were only a few servants aside from them, but Ron, Beacrox, the two kittens, and even deputy butler Hans were much stronger than himself.Cale made eye contact with each of the people before turning back to Choi Han to ask.\u201cYou can see them too, right?\u201d\u2018This is the protection for a wealthy Count\u2019s son.\u2019Cale started to smile. He knew that they would all protect him. Of course, he wasn\u2019t sure about Ron or Beacrox, but they would at least prevent him from getting killed by someone.\u2018And they are not the only protection.\u2019Cale decided to be a little more honest to Choi Han, who was sitting there looking at him. He patted his heart as he answered.\u201cI trust my heart. I will live.\u201dOf course. The Indestructible Shield surrounding his heart will protect him. Well, as long as he avoided people like Choi Han that is\u2026Choi Han looked toward Cale with shaky eyes.Meeow.Meow.\u201cHmm? What are you doing?\u201dOn and Hong approached Cale and started to push on his legs with their small paws. The claws on their paws hurt, making Cale frown, but the Cat Tribe siblings stopped eating and started to rub their cheeks on Cale\u2019s leg.Clack. Choi Han put down his empty soup bowl and stood up from his seat.\u201c...I\u2019ll be practicing with my sword now.\u201d\u201cRight after eating?\u201d\u201cI feel like I need to get stronger.\u201d\u2018...Scary punk. Are you trying to get strong enough to blow the whole Earth away?\u2019Cale turned away in disgust. At that time, Beacrox approached him with a new dish.\u201cPlease enjoy.\u201d\u201cOh! Thanks.\u201dCale looked at the plate that was filled with the highest quality spices and highest quality beef steak, and started to smile.\u201cBitter food and drinks like lemonade are best to restore your appetite.\u201dThis was the first time Ron had handed him a lemonade since their interaction at the tea shop. Cale just ignored the lemonade because he was excited about the steak.\u201cIf everyone has finished eating, we will start our evening training session soon.\u201dCale could hear the Vice Captain\u2019s loud voice and started to think.\u2018The Vice Captain must have been motivated by Choi Han.\u2019Cale looked at the fired up knights and soldiers as he chowed down on the steak and even the rabbit soup as well. The rabbit soup was pretty good once he tried it. Of course, he adamantly declined the jerky the kittens offered him. There was no seasoning on it so he wouldn\u2019t even touch it.* * *\u20183 days.\u2019Cale calculated as they entered the village.\u2018The Black Dragon will cause a mana explosion in 3 days.\u2019They were now in a Viscount\u2019s territory that was right next to the Henituse territory. A villa belonging to the Viscount was built in the mountain on the right side of this village a few years ago.Naturally, while it was labeled as the Viscount\u2019s villa on the outside, in reality, it belonged to Marquis Stan, the person responsible for making the Black Dragon go crazy. The viscount of this territory was nothing more than a dog of the Marquis.\u2018And in the mountain behind the villa hides the cave with the Black Dragon.\u2019The Black Dragon causes a mana explosion and sends the cave and the mountain flying. Cale looked at the small peak to the right of the mountain he crossed, and clicked his tongue.Venion of Marquis Stan\u2019s family. Cale was thinking about the Marquis\u2019s second son. He was a crazy psycho who crippled his own older brother to rise to the position of heir. \u00a0That psycho visits the villa every so often to torture the Black Dragon for fun.\u201cTsk.\u201dHans flinched at Cale clicking his tongue, and quickly brought Choi Han over and started to speak.\u201cYoung master, I will take Choi Han-nim and quickly look for an inn. Please wait a moment.\u201dThe carriage was currently stopped outside of the village entrance.\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cWe will be right back.\u201dCale nodded his head at Hans\u2019s statement while observing Choi Han. He had a nostalgic look in his eyes. Just why would Choi Han fight with an existence that caused a mana explosion? It was because he could not throw this small and quiet village away.Harris Village. This village was similar to the village that taught him about both love and hate. That was why he made a move to save the lives of these village people that he did not even know. Cale started to frown as he called Choi Han over.\u201cChoi Han.\u201d\u201c...Yes?\u201d\u201cHurry back.\u201dAh. A small gasp came out of Choi Han\u2019s mouth. This 17 year old boy who had lived for tens of years started to have an innocent smile on his face as he nodded his head. [1]\u201cYes sir. I will be right back.\u201dCale motioned as if he was annoyed, but Choi Han bowed before quickly starting to walk toward the village with Hans. Cale, who preferred this focused Choi Han to the one who had a blank expression, continued to watch him before suddenly starting to frown.He could see a carriage quickly heading in their direction.\u2018I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019Cale felt like someone with extremely sweaty hands was handing him a poisoned apple. It was a really bitter feeling. The cause of that bitter feeling was soon to be revealed.\u201cSuch-\u201dCale could not believe it.He could see an old man who could not manage to avoid the carriage, fall down on the road. He could also see Choi Han rushing toward the old man, as well as the carriage continuing to travel down the road like it was not going to stop.\u2018Such a cliche!\u2019There was a flag hanging on that carriage. A red snake. It was the symbol of Marquis Stan. Cale\u2019s eyes started to shake. It was about to happen. An incident was about to happen.Bang!Choi Han flung himself to rescue the old man, and the momentum forced him to smash into a building wall. Only then did the black carriage belonging to Marquis Stan finally stop.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale let out a sigh as he opened the carriage door. It looked like he had no choice but to head over to the site of that cliche event.1. Remember, Choi Han really doesn\u2019t agePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Heading Out (3)\u201cYoung master, are you heading over there?\u201dRon approached him as soon as he stepped out of the carriage.\u201cWho will go if I don\u2019t?\u201dRon and the Vice Captain started to chase after Cale, who was heading toward the incident location without any hesitation. The two surrounded Cale, as if the world was going to end soon, but Cale did not care.A man slowly walked out of the other carriage. Venion Stan.Cale started to frown deeply as soon as he saw him. There was only one line in the file that his father Count Deruth gave him regarding Venion Stan\u2019s personality.[A typical and authoritative noble]Cale, well, Kim Rok Soo, could also use the information from, \u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 to evaluate Venion.Your typical villain.However, it was quite a headache to meet that typical villain in real life, than it was as a character in a novel. Cale could not beat someone up for doing something bad or because he didn\u2019t like them like Choi Han could.The situation had already escalated a bit by the time Cale arrived. In those few short moments, Choi Han had already become so angry that his shoulders were shaking violently.\u201cHow can you get in the way of a noble person like that?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you saying when someone could have gotten hurt? Who was in the way? This only happened because you were driving the carriage like a maniac!\u201d\u201cPeasants should move out of the way when they see a noble\u2019s carriage. It is not my fault that this peasant was so stupid he just stood there without moving!\u201dChoi Han was arguing with one of Venion\u2019s lackeys, and Hans, who had been standing next to Choi Han, had a frown on his face as he approached Cale and whispered to into his ear.\u201cChoi Han-nim seems to be extremely agitated.\u201dHans seemed to have already realized that the owner of the carriage belonged to the Marquis\u2019s family. He also seemed to have realized that the person standing behind that lackey was none other than Venion Stan.That narcissist probably only stepped out of the carriage because he saw the symbol of the Henituse family on Cale\u2019s carriage.\u201cEnough.\u201dVenion, the man with beautiful blonde hair, gently spoke to his lackey. As soon as Venion\u2019s words came out, the lackey quickly moved behind Venion, as if he had never been angry in the first place. Only Choi Han was left huffing and puffing while consoling the scared old man.Tsk. Cale clicked his tongue.The lackey wasn\u2019t actually angry. He was pretty far away from Cale\u2019s carriage, but just like Venion, he probably saw the Golden Turtle on Cale\u2019s carriage. That was why he was exaggerating, being extremely loud while scolding Choi Han, so that it will draw Cale out to the scene. Hans knew what the lackey was doing, which led him to frown while waiting for Cale to arrive.Cale glared at Venion and the lackey before putting a hand on Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou too.\u201d\u201cBut-!\u201dCale knew why Choi Han was angry. This place was very similar to Harris Village, his second home. He was angry at the fact that these people put someone else\u2019s life in danger but didn\u2019t show even an iota of remorse, or any signs of apologizing.However, the victim in this, the old man, was unable to get angry. It was because he did not have anything to support him like Choi Han had.\u201cThey could have used another road, but decided not do so and could have hurt someone. How can I just let this be.\u201d\u201cChoi Han.\u201dCale put some pressure to push down on Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.\u201cCalm down.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s black pupils looked directly at Cale. Cale could see the angry Choi Han, no, to be specific, the Choi Han that was being held down by the memories of Harris Village, starting to calm down.After verifying that Choi Han was calming down, Cale turned his gaze to look at Venion Stan.Beautiful blonde hair and a slight smile on his lips. Perfectly ironed attire without a single wrinkle. Boots without a single scuff mark. However, the thing that caught Cale\u2019s attention was the small amount of red at the tip of Venion\u2019s white dress shirt.\u2018Some blood must have landed on him while he was enjoying watching the Black Dragon being tortured.\u2019A crazy bastard. This Venion Stan was someone who enjoyed his meal while watching the torturer whip the Black Dragon until it was covered with blood.\u201cNice to meet you. Are you someone from Count Henituse\u2019s household?\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to meet you, Young master Venion Stan.\u201dAs expected, the other party knew of Cale. Venion was not someone who had an easy life in reaching the heir position. The problem was that he was a quite a bit rude.\u201cMm.\u201dVenion Stan was the type that could gently smile at you, but you still feel nothing but disgust for him.\u201cI have not had any reason to come to this area, and have only heard stories, but I heard there was someone in the Count\u2019s family who was a free spirit and did not seem like a noble.\u201dVenion smiled as he observed Cale. It was a very annoying look, as if he was trying to start something.\u201cI heard that young master Basen Henituse had been taking part in all of the gatherings of the nobles since last year-.\u201d\u2018Why ask something you already know about?\u2019Cale was not talented in these kinds of small talk. That was why he smiled brightly and respectfully answered.\u201cYes. I am indeed that trash.\u201dTrash. The moment that word personally came out of Cale\u2019s mouth, Venion\u2019s lackey flinched.\u201cOne of the trashiest of all of the trash probably.\u201dThe corner of Venion\u2019s mouth started to twist up. His expression seemed to say that he had never seen such a crazy person before, but Cale did not care.Marquis Stan was someone who was strong enough to lead a faction, but Venion could not do as he pleased with other nobles until he was officially proclaimed as the future successor of the Marquis title.A Marquis would normally officially proclaim a child as their successor in order to provide protection to that child, as well as have that child start building their network at an early age. However, Marquis Stan had not done that yet.\u2018There are still three other children.\u2019Venion had two younger sisters and one younger brother. The Marquis enjoyed watching the competition between the siblings. Venion enjoyed watching the Black Dragon being tortured in order to destress from the competition with his siblings. The Marquis considered the competition between his children to be like an exciting sport. Naturally, the crippled eldest son was the result of this competition.It was a completely crazy household.\u2018Our Henituse family is an extremely great family in comparison.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re a very interesting person.\u201dVenion just casually responded to Cale\u2019s statement.The wealthy Count, who resided in the outskirts of the northeast without being a part of any faction. Who would try to develop a relationship with that family? If anything, people would just be greedy to take that land as their own.However, Venion didn\u2019t like Cale as a person. The trash eldest son and a pretty smart younger son. Knowing about Cale and Basen\u2019s relationship made Venion think of his own older brother when looking at Cale.However, Venion kept up the act of a proper noble, and handed the reigns of this incident to Cale.\u201cAn unexpected obstacle has made me waste time, but I guess it was a pretty good thing since I got to make your acquaintance, young master Cale.\u201dAn unexpected obstacle. Venion was referring to the old man. He was disappointed at the fact that his time was wasted because of this old man, and wanted to finish this on a happy note.\u201cBut it looks like you need to teach your subordinate to clearly distinguish between the people who have the right to travel across this road and this earth, as well as the people who have the right to make them stop.\u201dAs a well-known Marquis\u2019s unofficial successor, this was the most he could do to the trash of a Count\u2019s family. His tone was saying that, although they were both young masters, their statuses were completely different.Of course, Cale was quietly listening, but he wasn\u2019t the type to pay attention to a dog\u2019s yapping.Venion finished what he had to say and looked toward the most uncomfortable looking person in the group.Plop. The old man kneeled on the ground once Venion looked in his direction and bowed his head.\u201cM, my apologies.\u201dThe hands of the old man, who was bowing so low that his head could touch the ground, were shaking. Choi Han\u2019s hands were shaking as he watched the old man apologize.Each territory\u2019s residents would be shaped by the personality of the reigning noble. With the Viscount of this territory being one of Marquis Stan\u2019s dogs, they were also very authoritative and looked down on the commoners.The corners of Venion\u2019s lips started to go up. He was satisfied. After observing Venion, Cale called out to him.\u201cYoung master Venion.\u201dOnce Venion turned his head, Cale asked him a question.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201c\u2026I am.\u201dCale crouched down. His expensive clothes started to touch the ground. He then looked toward the shaking hands of the old man.\u2018It\u2019ll be dangerous if this continues.\u2019Cale was certain that he heard it.\u201cHuuuuuuuu~.\u201dThe sound of Choi Han taking a deep breath. That had to be the sound of him holding back his anger. The moment Cale heard it, he could feel chills on the back of his neck, and felt that if this continued any longer, the one to get beaten to a pulp would not be himself, but Venion. It didn\u2019t matter to him whether or not Venion was beaten to a pulp, but Choi Han could not punch a noble while he was associated with him.Cale put a hand on the old man\u2019s shoulder. Venion\u2019s eyebrow started to twitch. A noble\u2019s hand was on a commoner\u2019s shoulder.\u201cOld man.\u201dThe old man seemed to be extremely shocked as he lifted his head to look at Cale.\u201cY, yes?\u201dCale casually asked.\u201cWhere\u2019s the bar?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cWhere can I get some delicious alcohol? As you\u2019ve heard, I am trash. I don\u2019t feel refreshed in the morning if I don\u2019t have something to drink. I need to drink to make sure tomorrow is another great day. So.\u201dCale lifted the old man\u2019s upper body up. Venion, who had been watching Cale, quietly judged Cale and shook his head after hearing Cale mention alcohol.\u201cLead the way.\u201dMaking eye contact with the shaking pupils of the old man, Cale started to frown as he continued.\u201cAre you not going to get up?\u201dThe old man hesitated and looked back and forth between Venion and Cale. Cale just ignored him as he got back up and reached out the hand that had been on a commoner\u2019s shoulder toward Venion.\u201cIt was nice meeting you today, Young master Venion.\u201dCale was asking for a handshake.Venion quietly stood there and looked at Cale. At that moment, one of Venion\u2019s servants urgently approached them and whispered quietly to Venion. However, it was loud enough for everyone to hear.\u201cYoung master, we have been delayed enough already.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do not interrupt a conversation between nobles.\u201dVenion looked down at his servant without a smile on his face, and the servant quickly bowed. Venion smiled once again as he grabbed Cale\u2019s hand.\u201cI will just be on my way then, as I am very busy.\u201dHe then let go. It was a very short handshake. Cale started to smile like a drunk person, as he responded back.\u201cIf we happen to meet in the capital, let\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d\u201c\u2026I do not think we would appreciate the same thing, but sure.\u201dVenion\u2019s smile was lukewarm. Cale decided to do something big to finish this conversation.\u201cYes. Based on our interaction today, it truly looks like only young master Venion deserves to be the future patriarch of the Stan family. You are a very cool person.\u201dPatriarch. That word made Venion\u2019s eyes get cloudy. As Cale expected, Venion started to smile brightly once again, and offered praises for Cale as well.\u201cYoung master Cale is also a very interesting and free-spirited person. Let us meet again in the future.\u201d\u2018No. I have no desire to see you ever again. Even if I do, it will be from far, far away.\u2019Cale hid his true feelings and nodded his head. Venion quickly got back on his carriage, as if he was truly busy, and disappeared.Cale watched the carriage disappear before patting Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHalf of the nobles are like that.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s shoulders flinched at Cale\u2019s words, but Cale was already crouching in front of the old man again.\u201cOld man. You can\u2019t get up? Did you hurt your leg?\u201dPat pat.Cale inspected the old man\u2019s body as he said that. He did not seem to be injured. Cale started to observe the man with a confused expression. He then called Choi Han over.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dInstead of responding, Choi Han just looked at the back of the crouching Cale.\u201cYou take this old man home.\u201d\u201cN, no, I am okay. That bar you were talking about.\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019m not in the mood to drink.\u201dCale stopped the old man from trying to lead him to a bar, and looked toward Choi Han, who was standing next to him.\u201cSince you saved him, might as well do it all the way and take him safely back home.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times, but he could not say anything. At that moment, the old man\u2019s voice filled Cale\u2019s ears.\u201cMy place sells alcohol.\u201d\u201cHmm? Old man, your place was a bar?\u201dCale\u2019s eyes showed that he was really surprised. The old man awkwardly smiled, but continued to speak in a slightly more relaxed expression.\u201cYes, sir. It is this village\u2019s only inn. It has a bar and a restaurant as well.\u201d\u201cSince it is the only inn, that must be the best place. Hans!\u201dEven without Cale saying anything else, Hans quickly approached the old man and helped him up, before starting to ask about the inn. Once the two of them started to move, things started to get rowdy around them.Ron quickly approached Cale and brushed the dirt off Cale\u2019s clothes. The Vice Captain and the rest of the group headed toward the village entrance. The only people left there were Cale and Choi Han.\u201c\u2026Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you not angry?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201dChoi Han hesitated for a moment, and could not continue speaking. Cale shrugged his shoulders as he started to speak.\u201cThe fact that he looked down on me? Or how he made such an unbelievable statement to you? How he almost killed that old man and, instead of apologizing, said that he was an obstacle?\u201dCale\u2019s voice was calm and firm. He did not seem angry at all. In fact, it sounded indifferent. Cale continued to speak.\u201cDo you have to keep moving when you see someone in front of you? Why didn\u2019t you try to avoid him? Don\u2019t you see that you could have hurt the old man? How can you casually say that a person was an obstacle when you almost killed him?\u201dChoi Han paid attention to Cale, who was looking at a faraway mountain range. At the same time, he made sure to listen to Cale\u2019s every word. Cale continued to speak firmly.\u201cVenion, why is the old man apologizing to you? You should properly apologize to him.\u201dCale could speak like Choi Han, and there were times he wanted to do that. But.\u201cI am not someone who can speak like that. Nor do I want to. I\u2019m also not that angry.\u201dBut this was not the time. Cale knew that this was one of the things that made Choi Han look cool, but he did not want to look cool like that.The old man wasn\u2019t injured, and he didn\u2019t do anything that would get the blade pointed toward his family. The fact that he himself looked bad would be beneficial to Basen, so it was good anyways.\u201cAlso.\u201dCale was someone who always returned the favor, no matter how long it took. If someone looked down on him or does something to him, he will always get his revenge.\u201cThat bastard will probably soon be kicked out of his house.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dChoi Han could tell that the bastard Cale was referring to was Venion. That was why Choi Han showed a rare shocked expression on his face, as he looked toward Cale.Cale had a mischievous smile on his face. The two kittens, who were approaching him silently, halted their movement.Cale\u2019s smile grew larger as he continued to look toward the mountain to the right of the village. He thought to himself the thing he could not tell Choi Han.\u2018I plan on snatching that bastard\u2019s dragon.\u2019Once the dragon is gone, Venion will have to face the wrath of the Marquis, and would have a new obstacle in his way of becoming the family patriarch. Shouldn\u2019t someone who doesn\u2019t know when to stop on the road face at least one obstacle?Cale was willing to put a large obstacle in Venion\u2019s way. Of course, it would be done in secret. He casually spoke to Choi Han, who was looking at him with curiosity.\u201cIf you\u2019re curious, you can help me out.\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, I definitely want to help.\u201dChoi Han started to smile as well. It was a pretty evil smile for such a good-natured person, but the kittens were intrigued by that smile as well.Cale looked toward the mountain that was supposed to blow up in three days time, and started to mumble. The fact that he was looked down upon by Venion, as well as the blood on Venion\u2019s sleeves and the sight of the old man bowing to Venion were all still on Cale\u2019s mind.\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it.\u201dHe will be able to pay him back for it.\u201cYou definitely won\u2019t regret it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The exterior of the inn looked as rustic as the village, but it had everything you would need, probably because the merchants visiting the Henituse territory stayed at this inn on their travels.\u201cThis is the first time we have had a noble staying with us. Please look favorably upon us, even if it is lacking quite a bit, and just consider it as a place where lesser beings live.\u201dCale stared at the old man. He seemed more comfortable than when talking to Venion Stan, but he still seemed scared at the fact that a noble would be staying at his inn.It was fine for him to have a little bit of anxiety, but too much was uncomfortable for Cale as well.\u2018It\u2019s no good like this.\u2019Cale patted the old man\u2019s shoulder and tried to calm him down.\u201cOld man. Relax. I don\u2019t like people who put themselves down like that. This is the place that people who come and go from our territory stay to rest. There is no way such a place will be lacking.\u201dThe old man\u2019s pupils started to shake. He wet his upper lip with his tongue, before finally starting to speak after a bit of hesitation.\u201cYoung master, are there a lot of good people like you in the Henituse territory?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI am the biggest trash in our territory. Almost anybody you find will have a better personality than me.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe old man let out a gasp. On and Hong, who had taken control of the couch in the room, were meowing and shaking their heads, but nobody seemed to notice.\u201cYou can go do what you have to do.\u201dThe old man bowed deeply at Cale\u2019s dismissal and left the room. Cale found it annoying that the old man still seemed to be stiff, but decided not to care.Knock knock knock.Someone else was knocking on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door opened, and deputy butler Hans brought a small box inside.\u201cYoung master, you asked only for this box, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Hand it over.\u201dDeputy butler Hans showed curiosity as he handed the box to Cale. It was the only luggage Cale personally brought with him. He would just assume there was alcohol or snacks inside if it was a normal box, but this box was not normal.It was the highest quality magic box with a magic lock on it. The seal on the magic box was the logo of the Flynn Merchant Guild, one of the three large merchant guilds, and one that had an intimate relationship with the Henituse family.Cale casually commented while looking at Hans.\u201cIsn\u2019t a butler not supposed to show their emotion on their face? Especially curiosity?\u201d\u201cOne of the proper etiquettes of a butler is to show all of their emotions to their master.\u201d\u201cFunny man.\u201d\u201cI guess I am a bit funny.\u201dFor someone who didn\u2019t want to go to the capital other than for the kittens, Hans was a bit impudent, but Cale still thought he was much more personable than the other butler candidates. Seeing Hans starting to get used to him, Cale just responded like normal.\u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dAnd Hans left immediately, as usual. However, he had a question about their travels before closing the door.\u201cWill we be staying here for three days?\u201d\u201cYes. Take care of everything.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dHans responded as he closed the door. Other than the Vice Captain taking charge of the envoy\u2019s safety, Hans was responsible for everything else. However, he did not show any struggles in doing so, and efficiently took care of everything.\u201cHe seems like a good butler.\u201dThe silver kitten, On, said that as she approached Cale. Cale nodded his head. Then, the red kitten, Hong, followed behind.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that hard for him either.\u201dCale agreed with that statement as well. Ron was one thing, but other than Ron, Hans was the one who had the least difficulty dealing with Cale. He was scared of Cale, but did not find him to be difficult.\u2018He\u2019s a pretty decent butler.\u2019Cale brushed aside the kittens coming toward him and opened the box. The method of opening a box with a magic lock was simple. Cale\u2019s fingerprint. That was the only key that could open this particular box. Cale put his index finger on the center of the magic seal.Beep. Click.The box made a small noise before opening.Inside the box were the items Cale had prepared during the four days prior to leaving for the capital.\u201cI\u2019m really curious about what this is.\u201d\u201cReally curious.\u201dCale ignored the two pairs of golden pupils looking at him, and just vaguely answered.\u201cThings that will help rescue a poor soul, screw over some douchebags, and prevent me from getting hurt.\u201dOn and Hong looked up at him with curiosity, but Cale just caressed the items inside the box with satisfaction. He recalled the conversation he had with Billos, the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s bastard, before he left.\u2018Young master, just where do you plan on using these things?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t see why I have to explain that to you.\u2019\u2018\u2026I see. But it is going to cost quite a bit to purchase all of these items.\u2019\u2018\u2026Is it possible to rent them?\u2019\u2018For you, of course, it is possible.\u2019The majority of the items inside the box were magic tools. Cale had expected them to be expensive, but it really was too much. Cale had to use up all of the allowances he had earned from his father. He also had to return it all to Billos once he got to the capital.\u2018Annoying. I didn\u2019t want to get involved with him at the capital, but I have no other choice.\u2019\u2018Two of the items are not able to be rented out to outsiders. I rented them in my name, for you. So you must return these to me at the capital. In person.\u2019\u2018Sure.\u2019Cale grabbed one of the items in the box. It was a round, black orb with a lot of symbols engraved on it. The red kitten Hong put his paws on Cale\u2019s knee to ask.\u201cReally curious about this.\u201d\u201cA Mana Disturbance Tool. It is worth almost a billion gallon.\u201dGasp. Both On and Hong let out a gasp.\u201cIt cost 20 million gallons just to rent it.\u201dHong slowly lowered the paws that were on Cale\u2019s knee, before going toward the corner of the bed with his sister, On. They were trying to keep as much distance as possible from the black orb.Cale recalled the information about the orb. Billos had found exactly the item Cale was looking for.\u2018It causes a disturbance in the flow of mana within a certain range, making all magic tools stop working. It is also sturdy enough that, even if something like a mountain blowing up happens, it will not break.\u2019\u2018Something like a surveillance tool will break right away then?\u2019\u2018Of course. However, you do need to install this 27 hours in advance. It is created to slowly infuse a force that will disrupt the mana flow so that it will not be noticed by mages.\u2019\u2018How long will it last?\u2019\u201840 minutes. Isn\u2019t it great? Of course, if there are mages nearby, they will be able to resolve the issue within 5 - 10 minutes.\u2019\u2018I will keep that in mind.\u2019The corner of Cale\u2019s lips started to go up. It was the most expensive item he rented from Billos, but he will have many uses for it on this trip.\u2018I really like how durable it is.\u2019The Flynn Merchant Guild was a very useful place. Cale smiled with satisfaction, before throwing this black orb, that was smaller than the size of a toddler\u2019s fist, toward the kittens crouching in the corner.\u201cHuk!\u201dMeeeow!One of them gasped, while the other meowed and avoided the black orb, but in the end, they had to sit quietly in front of Cale with the black orb in front of their eyes.\u201cYou know how to read a map right?\u201dOn tapped her tail on the ground in response.\u201cOf course. We were potential successors to the Fog Cat Tribe at one point.\u201d\u201cRight. My sister is right.\u201dCale took out another important item, a map, from the box. It wasn\u2019t very detailed, just having the general landmarks around the Henituse territory. Most of the merchants going to and from the Henituse territory used this map.\u201cWe are in this village right now.\u201dCale pointed to the mountain to the right of the village.\u201cYou see this mountain?\u201d\u201cI see it.\u201d\u201cVery easy to see.\u201dThis was what Billos had said.\u2018Ah. The range is similar to the durability.\u2019One mountain.\u201cIf you go toward this mountain, you will see a villa in the distance. Behind that is a cave.\u201dThere were no mages around the Black Dragon right now. The people of the Magic Tower respected Dragons as the greatest magic race, and did not wish for humans to torture and domesticate a dragon. They considered it to be a big disgrace to magic.The people around the cave and the villa were knights and soldiers that the Marquis trusted, as well as the people who do the dirty work for them.\u201cDon\u2019t go near there at all. You cannot get caught.\u201dCale had heard about these two children\u2019s situation. That was why he was confident they could do this, but he still wanted to give them a warning. It would be bad if their curiosity led them to go around the cave.\u201cThere is something being tortured in there. We\u2019re going to rescue him, so you have to be careful.\u201d\u201cSomething?\u201d\u201cYes. It is even younger than you, Hong.\u201d\u201c\u2026Even younger than me?\u201d\u201cYes. 4 years old.\u201dOf course, that 4 year old was strong enough to send On or Hong flying once the mana restriction chains were removed.\u201cWe\u2019re going to save him?\u201dOn and Hong\u2019s eyes lit up as they pressed down on the bed with their paws.\u201cSave? Sure. Just stay in your cat form and go bury this orb in the mountain without getting caught.\u201dThere should be close to no chance of getting caught in their cat forms. Cale put the black orb in a small pouch, before putting it over On\u2019s neck like a necklace.\u201cWhere should we bury it?\u201d\u201cAnywhere on the mountain.\u201d\u201cReally, anywhere?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe siblings looked at each other before nodding their heads.\u201cEasy.\u201d\u201cWe even managed to get past our Cat Tribe\u2019s elders to escape.\u201dCale agreed with them.\u201cIt should be easy for the two of you. You two have enough skill for it. I wouldn\u2019t ask someone useless to do something like this in the first place.\u201dThe two kittens looked up at Cale with their golden pupils again. This pair of siblings, who were almost killed by their own tribe for not having abilities, even though they never got a chance to learn, were starting to get emotional. Their tails were wagging, and they crunched their noses to hold back their tears.Cale understood what these two were thinking and sternly continued.\u201cI will give you as much beef as you want once you successfully return.\u201dThe two siblings immediately jumped through the window and stealthily headed into the mountain.Naturally, the siblings did as Cale expected and earned their reward. They were able to have a 10-tier beef steak to themselves. The next day, Cale drank the lemonade that he had now gotten used to drinking, and asked Choi Han.\u201cHave you ever seen a dragon?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was talking about the vicious monsters deep inside the Forest of Darkness. Among those terrifying monsters were creatures that were somewhere between lizards and dragons.Choi Han had killed that dragon-like monster as soon as he advanced from the middle stage to the final stage of his Dark Destruction Sword Art.\u201cYou did? How was it?\u201dCale pretended to not know about the event, and asked Choi Han. Choi Han was the only other person in Cale\u2019s room right now.\u201c\u2026It was a monster.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s appearance, it\u2019s strength, everything. It was a monster in all aspects.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCale nodded his head and continued to speak. But his actions and his words were completely opposite.\u201cThen you have not seen a dragon.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cDragons are like people.\u201dClack. Cale put the cup with the lemonade that was both sweet and sour down on the table. He then responded to Choi Han, who was looking at him with curiosity.\u201cDragons, Beast people, Dwarves, Elves, they are all like humans. Why? Because they also have emotions and lives.\u201dThat aspect wasn\u2019t important to Cale. His main point started from here.\u201cHowever.\u201dChoi Han might have noticed Cale\u2019s sudden change in demeanor. He sat up straight and focused on what Cale had to say.\u201cSuch an existence has fallen into darkness since it was born. The only thing currently lighting up the darkness in its life is torches, and it has never even seen the light of the sun. What kind of life do you think it is having?\u201dTap.Cale tapped the table with his index finger.\u201cIt is being forced to become an existence without rationality.\u201dTap.He tapped on the table once again.\u201cIt has had to suffer through its loneliness, without any family or anything to lean on.\u201dTap.Choi Han\u2019s gaze fell every time Cale\u2019s finger tapped the table. Choi Han\u2019s fists were clenched underneath the table, to the point you could see his veins starting to flare up. Cale did not know about this, as he continued on.\u201cIt is tortured and abused every day, and is only left alone when it is barely alive.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s expression stiffened, and anger was in his eyes. Cale knew Choi Han would react this way. There was no way a good person like this would not get angry after hearing such a story. He should also have figured out why Cale brought up such a story in the first place.Cale took another sip of his lemonade, before finishing up his story.\u201cAnd that existence is nearby.\u201dA short silence filled the room. Cale looked out the window, before slowly turning his gaze to look at Choi Han. He didn\u2019t know what Choi Han was thinking about, but his whole body was surrounded by a bloody aura.\u2018Is he getting angry at the fact that it is abused because he is a good person?\u2019Contrary to Cale\u2019s hypothesis, Choi Han was currently recalling the tens of years he had to survive on his own in the Forest of Darkness.That was why the silence continued for a while. Finally, Choi Han made eye contact with Cale and asked.\u201cWill you save it and try to tame it?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale acted on reflex, and asked back in shock. Choi Han also became shocked at Cale\u2019s questioning his sanity.\u201cWhy would I try to tame it?\u201dCale waved his hand around like Choi Han was crazy.There was no way that a dragon that was abused by humans would be willing to serve a human. In fact, it probably was full of hate and disgust for any and all humans. Even if that human was the person that saved it.Dragons believe that they are above all creatures, including humans. This is a natural instinct for dragons, so, even without being in contact with any other Dragon in its whole life, it will still feel this way.That was why dragons cannot grow under humans. This attitude makes it impossible to domesticate and train Dragons without using torture and abuse to break down its mind.\u2018Dragons are born extremely arrogant. But, most importantly, if I raise a dragon\u2026\u2019Cale could feel it. He felt like he would get wrapped up in some annoying incidents if he raised a dragon.There were less than twenty total dragons in the Eastern and Western continents combined. Raise one of those dragons? That was pretty much the same as saying, \u2018I will be at the center of all the happenings of the continents.\u2019It was also a dragon that was supposed to die. It would be better for it to go off into its own little world and not get in anyone\u2019s way.Cale was definitely against this dragon coming with them. As long as he gets rid of the mana restriction chains, this four year old dragon will live a much better life than Cale. Dragons weren\u2019t called the kings of the world since birth for no reason.\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking such an obvious question?\u201dCale laughed at Choi Han\u2019s question before he answered.\u201cLet it go so it can live a free and peaceful life. Shouldn\u2019t a dragon live like a dragon?\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s clenched fists slowly started to relax.\u201cThen will we be saving that dragon?\u201d\u201cYes. So I need your help.\u201d\u201cAnything. I really will do anything to help.\u201dCale was worried that Choi Han would escalate the situation, and shook his head.\u201cNo need to go overboard. I have no plans to kill anybody, if possible, either. We will do it as quietly as possible.\u201d\u201cCale-nim, you really-\u201dChoi Han started to speak with admiration, but Cale looked at the clock, before cutting him off and saying what he needed to say.\u201cGo tell Ron to prepare some alcohol on the first floor.\u201d\u201cAre diff- what?\u201dCale was prepared to drink first.He started drinking even though it was the middle of the day. Choi Han just sat there with confusion on his face while looking around. Everybody other than himself looked peaceful.In the middle of that peaceful environment was Cale Henituse, drinking bottle after bottle. The growing flush on his face made anybody who was watching him know that he was drunk.\u201cIs it okay to let him drink so much?\u201dChoi Han looked toward Hans, who was next to him, and asked. Deputy butler Hans was delivering food to On and Hong, who were in their cat form. He still did not know that they were part of the Cat Tribe. He then refreshingly answered Choi Han\u2019s question.\u201cYes! There is nothing in his hand. Thus, it is safe! He promised he won\u2019t throw any bottles!\u201dChoi Han was talking about Cale\u2019s safety, but Hans was referring to themselves. Choi Han just shut up after seeing the conversation take an odd turn, and moved away from Hans. It was better to leave Hans alone when he was next to the kittens. Instead, Choi Han looked toward Cale to make sure he was safe.\u201cOwner. Your alcohol tastes great! Much better than I expected.\u201dCale didn\u2019t seem to know that Choi Han was looking at him, instead focusing on just praising the alcohol. They had been drinking for two hours already. There were some who were not drinking, just in case something happened, but the majority of the envoy was enjoying the festive atmosphere.\u2018They were all so nervous for the first hour, tsk.\u2019When Cale had ordered them to gather, as he would be drinking, the soldiers showed up with their helmets on. Cale couldn\u2019t believe it, but told them that he will not throw any bottles to help them relax.\u201cThis village may be small, but there are a lot of mountains around it. The alcohol is a special alcohol I made with fruit and herbs from the mountain. That is why it is a bit expensive.\u201dAs the old man mentioned, the alcohol really did taste great. Cale admired the alcohol, and lifted the bottle up to the old man.\u201cDo you have a lot of these?\u201d\u201cYes. Quite a bit.\u201d\u201cThen get some more and send it around to everybody here.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you don\u2019t need to-\u201dThe Vice Captain shouted out with a flushed face, but his eyes were focused on the bottle in Cale\u2019s hand. The rest of the soldiers were looking at the same thing. Naturally, Cale was aware of what they were thinking.\u201cJust drink. I\u2019m telling you to drink. Got it?\u201dThe eyes of the soldiers who were present all started to sparkle. It was the first time they became excited to see a bottle in Cale\u2019s hands.Cale watched the excited inn owner bring alcohol and snacks for everyone there with a sharp gaze.Cale Henituse. This human had a strong alcohol tolerance. Everybody thought he had a low tolerance because his face flushed easily and he caused a ruckus whenever he drank, but the truth was that he did all those things without being drunk at all.That was why Cale\u2019s head was perfectly clear right now. He drank for another thirty minutes or so before looking toward Choi Han and starting to speak.\u201cChoi Han. Come support me. I\u2019m going up to rest now.\u201d\u201cYoung master, I will do it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Vice Captain, rest a bit today. The rest of the soldiers as well. Didn\u2019t you fight in a battle yesterday? This is not a dangerous area, and I feel bad for the soldiers on guard duty, but the rest of you can relax and enjoy yourselves.\u201d\u201cYoung master-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired. Bye.\u201dIt would become complicated if the Vice Captain or the others followed him. Thankfully, none of them approached after seeing Choi Han supporting him. It was probably because Choi Han did not drink at all, and was also the strongest person there. They had nothing to worry about since such a person was going to be guarding Cale.\u2018Just one person left.\u2019It was easy to avoid the guards at the gate and around the inn, but Ron was still left. Hans and Ron would never come into the room if he told them not to come in. However, the difference between the two was that Hans was not skilled enough to know if Cale was still in the room, while Ron was so skilled that he would easily be able to tell if Cale snuck out.\u2018It\u2019s not like that old man will care about what I am doing.\u2019Realistically, Ron would not care whether Cale snuck out and what he did once he snuck out. That was how he had been until now. However, Cale didn\u2019t want things to get annoying in the future, so he decided to tell Ron in advance.Seeing Ron follow behind Choi Han, Cale quickly informed Ron.\u201cRon, I\u2019m going to go out to play. It\u2019s a secret. Got it?\u201dThis old man liked to drink, but did not drink a single drop tonight. Instead, he was just staring at Cale all night. He really was a scary person. This benign smile that Ron was giving him right now was even scarier.\u201cI understand. I will be waiting for you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\u2018Wait for me, my ass.\u2019As expected, Ron agreed without saying anything else. Cale continued to be supported by Choi Han as he went into his room.\u201cI\u2019m going to be resting. Hans, Ron, don\u2019t come in to wake me up unless it is an emergency. You know how I get when someone messes with my sleep, right?\u201dIn the past, a servant received a barrage of swearing when they had to wake Cale up in Ron\u2019s place. Although Cale did not physically hit anybody, that servant went around the estate telling all the other servants about how he felt like he was hit by a flurry of swear punches.\u201cOf course I do, young master. Please rest well.\u201d\u201cYoung master, this Ron will be standing right outside your room.\u201dCale\u2019s expression stiffened at Ron\u2019s response, but he watched the two of them leave, before stealthily giving an order to Choi Han.\u201cUse to windows to quietly come back to my room.\u201dChoi Han nodded his head and quickly followed the other two out of the room and closed the door.Meeeeeow.\u201cIs it time now?\u201dCale nodded his head at On and Hong, who followed him up to his room, and immediately opened the box.Click.The magic lock clicked open, and Cale removed an outfit from inside the box. Once he finished changing, Choi Han entered through the window, and then his eyes opened wide in shock.\u201cCale-nim?\u201dBefore putting on the mask, Cale threw the black outfit in his hand toward Choi Han.\u201cYou wear it too.\u201dThe orb from yesterday should temporarily stop the magic recording devices, but that was not enough. Cale did not want to get caught. That was why he had been drinking since the middle of the day and prepared these outfits.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe black outfit had a single red star and five smaller white stars surrounding it on the chest area.\u2018What is it? The outfit of the secret organization.\u2019\u2018The Birth of a Hero\u2019 novel clearly and accurately explained the outfit of the secret organization that Choi Han runs into time after time. This outfit was specially ordered by Cale following the explanation as accurately as possible. Just to be on the safe side, Cale even had the outfit created separately, and personally added the stars.That was why it was a bit crude up close, but it was pretty decent from a distance.People who see this outfit will not remember the crudeness of the stitching, they will just remember that it was, \u2018A black outfit with one red star and five white stars.\u2019 For Venion, who has not personally met the secret organization like the Marquis did, the report from the subordinates who saw this outfit will definitely give him a significant headache and anger.\u201c\u2026Are we doing something bad?\u201dChoi Han asked once more after seeing Cale not respond. Seeing Cale with the black mask on as well definitely made him seem like a villain.\u201cYes. We are doing something bad.\u201dCale started to smile underneath the mask.\u201cWe\u2019re doing something bad to Venion.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dChoi Han seemed to finally understand, as he quickly pointed to the other mask in Cale\u2019s hand.\u201cPlease give it to me.\u201dEven good people will have someone they don\u2019t like and want to screw over. That was no different for this 17 year old, who spent tens of years alone in this world.\u201cAh, and these kids are from the Cat Tribe. They are beast people.\u201dCale casually introduced On and Hong to Choi Han as if it was nothing, and they just simply exchanged greetings as well. The Cat Tribe children, who were sensitive to a person\u2019s true character, already had a good idea about Choi Han\u2019s strength, and Choi Han had noticed they were not your average cats during their travel.\u201cHe\u2019s Choi Han, this is On, that is Hong. End of introductions. Everybody get ready.\u201dThere was a short time to get ready before Cale ordered Choi Han, who had just come out of the restroom wearing the same black outfit and black mask.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe then added on, as he stood in front of the second story window.\u201cCarry me when you go out the window. I can\u2019t jump so far down without getting hurt.\u201dChoi Han let out a sigh for the first time in front of Cale. On and Hong approached Choi Han and patted him with their paws to console him. Cale urged them on once again.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201dThe group that safely exited the inn headed for the mountain with the Viscount\u2019s Villa and the Dragon\u2019s prison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On and Hong had buried the black orb 50 meters away from that cave, in an area filled with trees and shrubs, making it very difficult for the orb to be located.\u201cYou two are kind of amazing.\u201d\u201cSomething like this is a piece of cake.\u201dOn was saying it was easy, but Cale could see On\u2019s nose twitching in joy.Cale, Choi Han, On, and Hong crouched around the location that the black orb, officially known as the Mana Disturbance Tool, was located, and looked toward the cave entrance that was 50 meters away, as well as the Viscount\u2019s villa that was farther away.\u201cYou remember the plan?\u201dCale had explained the plan on their way over. Realistically speaking, there wasn\u2019t much of a plan.\u201cThere are a total of 6 people on guard at this time.\u201dCale recalled the information he read in, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 The Black Dragon was smart, like most dragons. It had been gathering information for the four long years it was held captive, and there was a reason it attempted its escape two days later at around this time.There were, approximately, a total of 30 people residing in the villa. Originally, there were close to 100 people, but it slowly went down as they realized during the last four years that nobody really came to this area.Of course, among the 30 people, there were 3 high-leveled knights at the Vice Captain\u2019s level, as well as 7 mid-leveled knights. There were also soldiers, the torturer, and random laborers. The number of people here showed just how much attention the Marquis has been putting onto this location.However, Cale had Choi Han. Choi Han was someone who could take down the strongest knight in the Roan Kingdom in 10 moves. Someone like that was on their side.\u201cLet me explain one more time. There is one high-leveled knight and two mid-leveled knights at the cave entrance, as well as two soldiers. Inside the cave, there is just one high-leveled knight, and the torturer is at the end of the cave.\u201dChoi Han flinched after hearing the word torturer, but Cale did not care. Cale did not care to know about the things that were going through Choi Han\u2019s mind right now. The important thing was that the black orb will activate soon, and that they needed to move quickly in response.\u201cThe magic recording devices located from the villa to the cave entrance will not work for 40 minutes thanks to the black orb that On and Hong buried. That is the same for the alarms, magic traps, and anything else. Nothing will work for 40 minutes.\u201dThey needed to domesticate this dragon, the greatest magic using creature in the world, but they could not ask any mages for help. That was why Marquis Stan chose to fill this area with magic items instead. The reason that there were only a few guards around the entrance was also because they trusted their magic items.That was why the dragon had no choice but to cause a mana explosion to escape.\u2018An eye for an eye, and money for money.\u2019Since the Marquis used money, Cale used money as well. Cale patted the magic bag on his waist. This was a magic bag that allowed you to store a lot of items. Inside this bag were all sorts of magic items, useful tools, and objects.\u201cI just need to take out the guards?\u201dNaturally, Choi Han would be doing the battling. Why would Cale even try to fight when such a strong person was next to him? Cale thought paper-cuts hurt a lot, so he didn\u2019t want to even think about getting cut by a sword.\u201cYes. You are the only one I can rely on to cover my back.\u201d\u2018At least for now.\u2019Cale looked at Choi Han with a serious expression, and Choi Han nodded his head and sincerely responded back.\u201cI will definitely live up to your expectations.\u201d\u201cYes. As I mentioned, make sure they see our outfit and then knock them out. Don\u2019t kill them, and don\u2019t show them your sword art. You remember what to do after that, right?\u201dChoi Han\u2019s unique transparent black aura should be easily camouflaged by the darkness, if he uses it carefully. Cale believed Choi Han should understand, since he had already told him many times.\u201cYes, I remember it all.\u201d\u201cGood, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201dCale patted Choi Han\u2019s shoulders, before handing him the voice changing device. It would be bad if he had to talk during the fight and they recognized his voice.\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, so don\u2019t break it.\u201d\u201cGot it. You do not need to worry about it.\u201dCale then looked toward the kittens. Cale responded to their wagging tails, that seemed to be asking for something.\u201cI will give you meat once it is over.\u201dThat did not seem to be the right answer, as they snorted and turned away. Cale didn\u2019t think much about it, instead verifying the time with his watch.\u2018Five minutes left.\u2019The sky had already gotten dark, and it was night time.Cale then recalled the conversation he had with Billos.\u2018The magic items that have been influenced by the Mana Disturbance Tool will instantly stop working, and most of them will turn off to prevent it from blowing up. However, the highest quality magic items will start beeping to signal that they are broken. It isn\u2019t like alarm magic, instead, it is more like a clock alarm.\u2019\u2018It will probably be loud?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know where you plan on using it, but it should be loud enough for the enemy to hear.\u2019Billos started to smirk and continued on.\u2018However, if there are a lot of magic items in the area, it will probably get chaotic with all of the alarms going off at the same time.\u2019Chaotic was enough for Cale.\u201cGet ready.\u201dThe kittens also covered themselves with charcoal to cover the color of their furs. They then left Cale\u2019s side and disappeared into the darkness, such that Cale could no longer see them. The two of them would not be showing themselves in front of the enemies today.However, Cale knew that they would follow the plan and be around him.Choi Han folded up the handkerchief he was using to clean his blade, and put it in his pocket.Once all of the preparations were finished, Cale stood up.Brrrrrrrrrrrring.Something started to vibrate right underneath where Cale had been sitting. The black orb had started to activate.Click. Click.The seconds hand of Cale\u2019s watch slowly approached the set time.And finally, the last click.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAt Cale\u2019s order, Choi Han followed the plan and ran ahead quickly, while On started to create fog in the area. Cale was at the center of the fog, making it difficult to see him. At the same time,Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring-The black orb finally activated.\u201cI guess they aren\u2019t all highest quality magic items.\u201dSome of the magic items started to ring loudly to sound their status. Cale followed behind Choi Han with the fog surrounding him, and headed toward the cave.Starting now, it was a battle against time.Choi Han was already fighting against the knights in front of the cave.\u2018Scary bastard.\u2019In that short amount of time, the soldiers already had injuries on their arms and legs, and were knocked out on the floor.\u201cWho are you? How dare you come to this place!\u201dChoi Han easily dodged the attack of the high-leveled knight. He then took a step forward and made a deep cut on the side of the knight. He then avoided the blood spurting out of the cut, and used his elbow to attack the knight\u2019s back, followed by the back of the knight\u2019s neck. The knight fainted instantly.\u201cShit! What the hell is going on?!\u201dThe high-leveled knight inside the cave soon showed up as well.\u201cPoison.\u201dCale spoke through the voice changing device. The fog surrounding him started to expand, and Hong started to stealthily move around and spread the poison to paralyze the enemy. The fainted individuals would not be able to move for a while, even if they did wake up.Cale then made eye contact with the high-leveled knight and said one word.\u201cCover.\u201dChoi Han instantly stood in front of Cale and darted toward the cave entrance. Cale followed behind him.\u201cBlock them!\u201dAt the high-leveled knight\u2019s shout, two mid-leveled knights immediately charged toward Choi Han. Their swords started to glow, showing that the knights had inputted their aura into their swords. However, those two swords were instantly cut down.Clang. Clang. The upper half of both swords fell down to the ground.\u201cW, what the? Is he a swordmaster?\u201dBoth shock and despair was in the voice of the high-leveled knight. The only thing that could cut through an aura-filled sword was a swordmaster\u2019s aura blade. After instantly cutting through the enemy weapons using his aura, which was camouflaged in the darkness, Choi Han used his sword and scabbard to attack a mid-leveled knight\u2019s neck and stomach at the same time.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cGuuh!\u201d\u2018\u2026He just needs one hit per person.\u2019Cale could not hide his amazement as he crouched behind Choi Han and continued to move. At that moment, they could hear some ruckus from far behind them.\u201cIntruders!\u201dIt was coming from the villa. Cale turned his gaze back forward.The mid-leveled knights staggered before falling down. Cale made eye contact with them. They had been poisoned by Hong\u2019s paralysis poison.\u201cP, poison\u2026!\u201d\u201cA, assassin!\u201dChoi Han made them faint before quickly rushing toward the charging high-leveled knight and swinging his sword. Cale used that opening to go through the cave entrance. Even while he was doing that, he made sure the mid-leveled knights who called him an assassin saw the six stars on his outfit before fainting.\u201cUgh! Where did these people come from!\u201d\u201cSo loud.\u201dChoi Han easily avoided the mana-filled sword of the high-leveled knight. He was dragging this out on purpose.While Choi Han was acting as the distraction, Cale entered the cave behind the Cat Tribe children, who had stealthily entered earlier on. After verifying that Cale had entered, Choi Han moved to the front of the cave entrance.He then called out to the high-leveled knight.\u201cCome.\u201dOf course, his gaze was not looking at the knight, but all of the enemies coming from the villa with torches.\u201cI leave it to you.\u201dChoi Han could hear Cale\u2019s changed, yet still calm voice behind him, and started to smile. However, he quickly focused on releasing only some of his strength. Dark Destruction Sword Art. This sword art consisted of two components, darkness and destruction. Of the two, the force of destruction started to surround Choi Han.\u201cNobody can get past this spot.\u201dHe was someone who always kept his word.While Choi Han was protecting the entrance, there was someone else protecting something in a different manner in the cave. That person was none other than the torturer. He was the one to protect the dragon\u2019s prison. By the time Cale arrived inside, he was already in a state of chaos.\u201cWhy, why?! Why is the Magic Crystal Ball not working?!\u201dThe Magic Crystal Ball that the torturer held onto was one of the emergency backups that Venion had prepared in case something went wrong.\u201cD, don\u2019t come here! Do you know what is in here?!\u201dThe torturer was shaking violently while looking at Cale. He had no choice but to be scared. If the torturer received an attack higher than an average person\u2019s strength, he would instantly blow up.It was one of Venion\u2019s safety measures as well. The strength of the blast would make the prison key and the prison itself blow up with the torturer as well. Naturally, the torturer knew about this.\u201cIf you come, everyone here will die!\u201dTsk. Cale waved his hand while looking at the shaking torturer. Once he did, fog started to form in the air and headed for the torturer. On, the owner of the fog, was hidden in the shadows of the cave and still hidden.\u201cA, aaaaaah! Go away!\u201dThe sounds of battle from the cave entrance. The approaching fog. Of course, the inside the fog was completely filled with poison. The paralyzing fog quickly surrounded the torturer.\u201cJust what, ugh, p, poison\u2026!\u201dUgh. The torturer\u2019s body started to shake as he fell to the ground. The torturer looked so terrible, being unable to speak or move as he forcibly shook on the floor. Cale approached the torturer and rummaged through his clothes.If you could not attack him, you just had to hit him with poison. Either that, or make a deal with him to hand the key over. However, he didn\u2019t want to use the latter method.\u2018Here it is.\u2019Cale grabbed the key and closed the eyes of the torturer, who was starting to lose consciousness from the poison. Cale wondered if they had used too much of the poison, but didn\u2019t really care.\u2018I don\u2019t think he will die, but if he dies, oh well.\u2019Cale snapped his fingers. Two little black bundles fell from the ceiling almost instantly. It was On and Hong. Once they came under the torch that Cale was holding, he could finally see the two of them clearly.Cale verified that On and Hong were safe before heading to the farthest corner of the cave.One he arrived, he could see a curled up black existence inside this now-useless magic prison. It was the dragon. The thing that shocked Cale more than the dragon itself was the blood covering the dragon and the scent of blood in the air.Cale quickly approached the prison.The dragon continued to keep its eyes closed, even as Cale approached. The dragon was probably in a state of chaos right now.Cale put the key into the lock and opened the door.Click. It unlocked with a light noise. Cale slowly opened the iron gate, and entered into the prison.It was pretty large to be called a prison. There were whips and other torture tools, as well as the luxurious couch that Venion sat on to watch. Cale headed to the corner of the prison.A small figure about 1 meter long was laying on a stack of hay in the corner. The inner eyelids of the dragon were shaking as it laid there with its eyes closed. There were chains on all of its limbs, and the mana restriction chain was on its neck, making it unable to use any strength.\u201cHey.\u201dCale crouched in front of the dragon. The dragon did not open its eyes even after Cale called out to it. Cale verified his watch. It was time to leave. He continued to speak to the dragon.\u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201dCale used the key he had obtained from the torturer to undo the chains.The dragon opened its eyes at that moment. Cale started to smile after looking at the dragon\u2019s eyes.It was still a very strong gaze. It had not lost its will to live just yet.It was not the dying gaze that Choi Han had run into in the novel. It was still a gaze with a strong desire to live. That was why it was filled with energy, anger, and resistance.It was the gaze of a dragon.\u201cWhat a nice gaze.\u201dCale lifted the dragon into his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The dragon started to show its teeth and growl at them. This was probably the first time in its life it ever saw anything other than humans.Cale verified the time on his watch. It looked like they had just enough time to escape.\u201cIt looks like it hurts.\u201dOn approached Cale and tapped his leg. She seemed to be thinking about the potion Cale brought in his magic box. She couldn\u2019t ask him for it, so she could only act this way.\u201cHold on.\u201dCale had brought that potion to use it. However, he needed to wait until the mana restriction chains were off. The potion would only work properly if the mana, which was practically as important as a dragon\u2019s heart, was no longer restricted.Cale started to head toward the opposite side of the prison, the location the torturer seemed to be guarding. It wasn\u2019t very loud, but he could hear Choi Han fighting in the distance. Cale presumed that Choi Han\u2019s battle would end soon as well.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dCale started to pat the cave wall with his hands. He kicked the torturer with his foot to get him out of the way, and continued to pat every aspect of the wall. The dragon growled after seeing the torturer, but stayed still and continued to focus on Cale.\u2018Venion\u2019s last line of defense should be around here somewhere.\u2019Like all of the members of Marquis Stan\u2019s family, Venion was extremely worried about someone intruding while he was inside. He had created a secret tunnel to use as an escape route if something like that ever happened. If the torturer knew about it, he probably would have used it to escape earlier, but, sadly, even the torturer did not know about this escape route.\u2018The novel said there was a flat area on this bumpy wall-, ah here it is.\u2019There was a flat area about the size of a person\u2019s hand on this bumpy cave wall. Although Venion looked like he had OCD and would never do anything like training, everyone in the Marquis\u2019s family had learned martial arts.\u2018If you use a strong enough force on that location, the wall will open.\u2019It was not a magic device. Instead, the force of the impact made the device move. Cale turned his head to look toward the person who entered and asked.\u201cAll done?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChoi Han lightly swung his sword in the air to get rid of the blood on it and then approached Cale. His gaze soon turned toward the dragon, and started to frown. It was a natural reaction to seeing such a small creature being covered in blood. The glare in Choi Han\u2019s eyes as he stared at the torturer was vicious.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dThat was why Cale had called out to Choi Han. Choi Han was still glaring at the torturer as he reported.\u201cAs you ordered, I left the escaping workers alone. I also made sure that all of the strong individuals would not be able to fight.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201dCale praised Choi Han before pointing to the flat area on the wall.\u201cPunch this spot.\u201d\u201cAs strong as I can?\u201d\u2018Are you planning on destroying the cave?\u2019\u201cNo. Control your strength. Just pretend you are creating a 10cm dent in this wall.\u201d\u201cMm. So, very lightly.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dVery lightly? Cale quickly stepped away from Choi Han after hearing Choi Han call something that was impossible for Cale to do as only using a tiny bit of his strength.Choi Han understood that to be Cale telling him to hurry, and immediately punched the wall with his fist.Boom!\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dCale picked the dragon back up while the kitten siblings were admiring what happened.Screeeeeeeech-A chilling screeching noise came out of the wall, and an area the size of an adult male appeared to one side of the cave wall. Choi Han quickly picked up the torch.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAt Cale\u2019s command, the kittens got on Choi Han\u2019s back, as Choi Han stepped into the tunnel first. Cale followed behind him. The dragon remained quiet in Cale\u2019s arms, with only the sound of its breathing coming out of it. However, the eyes that were staring at Cale were still extremely vicious.Rather than any gratitude for saving him, it seemed to be filled with thoughts of terror about being tortured by someone else, as well as anger and resentment toward humans.\u201cStop staring at me like that.\u201dCale casually talked to the dragon in his arms.\u2018Ah, I\u2019m a bit out of breath.\u2019Cale was out of breath as he tried to keep up with Choi Han, who seemed to have no issues running.\u2018Should I have made Choi Han carry the dragon?\u2019The 1 meter long dragon was pretty heavy. It would not be this hard if he was able to get his hands on the ancient power called the \u2018Vitality of the Heart.\u2019Cale held the dragon tightly in his arms, so that he would not throw it away in anger. There was no way he could leave it here after spending all that effort to rescue it.The dragon just continued to watch him. Cale\u2019s black clothes started to become covered in the dragon\u2019s blood.After running through that dark and narrow tunnel for a few minutes, Choi Han suddenly called out to Cale.\u201cThere is a wall in front of us.\u201d\u201cHit the center of the wall with your fist with the same strength as before. Then we will continue to run as discussed.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dThe kittens jumped off of Choi Han\u2019s shoulder and started to run. Choi Han put some strength into his fist and hit the center of the wall with the same strength as earlier.Boom!The wall almost instantly collapsed, and they could see the night sky. They were outside the cave. This time, Cale took the lead as he looked around.This was the reason they needed the Mana Disturbance Tool to work on the entire mountain. Venion had put a magic recording device on this secret tunnel entrance as well. He was a very thorough person.Cale didn\u2019t know exactly where this entrance was located, necessitating the Mana Disturbance Tool to work on the entire mountain.They did not have much time left. They needed to get out of the range of the magic recording device in the next one or two minutes. But it should not be a problem.Choi Han followed behind Cale and made new traces of their presence, or erased some traces as they passed. After surviving in the Forest of Darkness on his own for so long, he was an expert at creating and following tracks. After running away from the secret tunnel entrance for about two minutes, Cale looked at his watch.\u201cStop.\u201dThe alarms that were going off in the area suddenly stopped blarring. The Mana Disturbance Tool had stopped working.\u201cHuuuu~.\u201dCale took a deep breath, calming his rapidly beating heart. The Indestructible Shield around his heart was gathering strength every time his heart beat like that, just in case an emergency situation happened.\u2018I have no plans to use it right now.\u2019However, Cale was not planning on using this shield just yet. After freeing this dragon and saying goodbye to Choi Han in the next city, he was planning on gaining the ancient power, \u2018Vitality of the Heart,\u2019 To strengthen this shield. Only then would he use the shield.Now that he had the time to look around, Cale looked down toward the dragon. He then started to smile.The rebellious gaze was gone, and the dragon was looking up at the night sky in admiration. This was the first time the dragon saw anything other than the cave walls in its four years of life. Cale understood what the dragon was feeling, and wanted to give it some more time, but he could not do that.He put the dragon down on the grass and continued to look at it. The dragon looked right back at him. Its eyes were once again filled with anger and resentment, as it curled its body up and looked ready to attack.\u2018No wonder it continued to get tortured for four years. It won\u2019t back down at all.\u2019That was why Cale personally liked this dragon. It was different from himself. Growing up being abused as an orphan, Cale, well, Kim Rok Soo, had given in. After that, he didn\u2019t want to be the main character of a story, like Choi Han. After giving in at a place he called home, he didn\u2019t think he had the strength to fight against the world.\u201cHey.\u201dCale made sure the dragon was looking at him, then took out a pair of gloves and some scissors-shaped cutting tool. There were a lot of magic seals on both of the blades for cutting. He then put on the electricity-resistant gloves.This cutter was one of the two items that had to be rented in Billos\u2019s name. This was not something you could borrow with money.\u2018I don\u2019t know why you need this, but, young master, I hope to see you alive in the capital.\u2019\u2018You think I\u2019m going to die?\u2019\u2018All I know is that you plan to cause a commotion.\u2019\u2018\u2026Shut up.\u2019Cale was thinking about the conversation he had with Billos, before realizing that his surroundings suddenly became extremely quiet. Choi Han was looking at the cutter with chaotic eyes, while the kitten siblings had moved away from Cale and were hiding behind Choi Han.The dragon was still just staring at him.\u201cTsk.\u201dCale clicked his tongue at their response and approached the dragon. The mana restriction chain was made with something similar to rubber. If it was made of metal, it would not have fit the growing dragon. That was why it was made of something with some elasticity.He then grabbed the dragon\u2019s neck.\u201cGasp.\u201dThe kittens took in a deep breath. However, Cale ignored them as he continued onward, since it was better to do this as fast as possible. The cutter headed for the dragon\u2019s neck. The sharp blade shone under the moonlight, and the dragon just paid attention to Cale\u2019s eyes. Cale\u2019s eyes were emotionless and peaceful.The dragon closed its eyes.At that moment, they all heard the snapping noise of something getting cut.Sizzle. Sizzle.The mana restriction chain was causing sparks in Cale\u2019s hands.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dCale scoffed at the dragon that had opened its eyes back to look at him and took off one of the gloves and handed it to Choi Han. Choi Han put the glove on and Cale handed the chain to him before taking the potion out of his pocket.It was a highest grade potion. Even this cost quite a bit to purchase. It made Cale feel bad for asking for an allowance the last few days before he left. Cale clicked his tongue and sharply stared at the dragon.\u201cDo you know how much money I spent on you?\u201dThe dragon could hear the same words he heard quite often. He had heard it almost every day since he was born. Why do you not listen to me when I spent so much money on you? Guess you need to be beaten some more. Then he was beaten. They said that he needed to stop thinking for himself and listen to them as they continued to beat him.However.\u201cSince I spent so much money on you, you better heal properly, you stupid fool.\u201dThe dragon did not feel any pain.Cale poured about half of the potion onto the dragon\u2019s back, and poured the rest into its mouth. Thankfully, the dragon did not resist, and swallowed it down.After a few minutes, Cale could only think that it really was a dragon. The mana, which was the equivalent to the dragon\u2019s heart and the source of all of its power, started to move in its body.All of the injuries on the dragon\u2019s body instantly disappeared, and a blue aura that seemed to be the dragon\u2019s mana surrounded its body like the wind.This change that occurred in an instant made Cale think about just how scary and powerful of an existence dragons really were in this world.\u201cHey.\u201dThe dragon should have no reason to get injured anymore. The smart dragon seemed to understand what had happened to its body, as its eyes came completely back to life.Cale took a step toward the dragon. The baby dragon curled up while continuing to observe Cale. Cale ignored the dragon and asked.\u201cWhat do you want to do now?\u201dCale started to smile while looking at the dragon that remaining silent.\u201cI know you can speak the human language. You are a dragon. The smartest and strongest existence in the world.\u201dCale asked once more.\u201cWhat did you want to do once you got free?\u201d\u201c\u2026I.\u201dThe dragon started to speak. The dragon really did know how to speak the human language. It was much smarter than humans. There was no way it did not learn the human language in the last four years.\u201cI.\u201dThe dragon could feel it in his heart. With his current strength, he could easily kill the man in front of him. He was scared of the man in the back, but it would be possible for him to escape alive. He had gained the strength he had waited for so long to obtain.That was why the dragon finally said the thing he had thought to himself over and over for the last four years. However, this was the first time he had ever he said it out loud.\u201cI will live.\u201dHe will live, no matter what it took.\u201cI will go away.\u201dHe was going to go away from here.He revealed his inner thoughts.\u201cI will not be tamed.\u201d\u201cYes. You are right.\u201dCale was saying the dragon was right.\u201cYou are a dragon. A DRAGON. You have the right to live freely.\u201dEven a four-year-old dragon was stronger than most of the animals in the world. It had enough strength to survive on its own, and, normally, dragons were extremely independent and prideful. They generally wanted to create their own lair once they turned about two years old. It was completely worlds apart than a human two-year-old.Cale looked into the eyes of the dragon, that still did not trust humans, and sternly started to speak.\u201cI will not take care of you.\u201dCale did not have a reason to look after something that was stronger than him. There were also too many potential headaches to keep him around to pay back for Cale\u2019s help. It was different from the children from the Cat Tribe, On and Hong. A dragon was beyond Cale\u2019s limits.The dragon could not trust Cale.\u201cLiar. Humans are good at lying.\u201dThere was now anger in the dragon\u2019s eyes. That anger was not directed at Cale, however. Dragons were naturally born with a lot of pride. This anger came from the years that his pride was trampled upon by the humans.\u201cI guess that is true. I do lie quite a bit as well.\u201dCale easily accepted the dragon\u2019s words, and continued to speak.\u201cLive however you want to live. What is it you want to do?\u201d\u201cI-.\u201dThe baby dragon lifted its head to look at the night sky. It was different from the darkness inside the cave. It was dark, but there was still light.\u201cI hate humans. I want to be free.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dCale got up from his seat. He then took out some mid-grade potions and a smaller pouch from his magic bag and put the potions in the bag before handing it to the dragon.\u201cLive freely.\u201dThe dragon\u2019s black pupils enlarged and started to shake. However, there was still doubt and resentment in its eyes. Naturally, Cale did not care.\u2018This should be enough.\u2019He freed the dragon, screwed Venion over, saved the village, and helped Choi Han understand what freedom means thanks to the dragon.Most importantly, he did not need to take responsibility for the dragon. He could see in its eyes that it did not want to follow him. It was a very good conclusion. Cale spoke to his party members in a satisfied tone.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe turned his back to the dragon with no regrets, and started to walk. Choi Han silently followed behind Cale and focused on altering their tracks. The kittens, who hesitated for a moment, saw the dragon turn its gaze away from Cale before following behind him.Once even the Cat Tribe sibling turned away from it, the dragon lifted its head and watched them walk away.\u201c\u2026I hate humans\u2026they are evil\u2026\u201dFor some reason, the dragon was paying more attention to the back of the human, the race that he was annoyingly used to and hated, rather than the night sky that it was seeing for the first time.Hong slowly approached his sister On as they followed behind Cale.\u201cNoona, I think he\u2019s going to follow us.\u201d\u201cUh huh. I think so too.\u201d\u201cAm I going to get a younger brother?\u201d\u201cIt looks like it.\u201dThe kittens were conversing with themselves, but Cale scoffed at them and retorted back.\u201cNo way. Dragons are extremely prideful and will never accept being under a human. Furthermore, this dragon hates humans.\u201dOn\u2019s expression seemed to disagree. If a cat had a mocking expression, it would probably be the one of On\u2019s face right now. On shook her head and quietly mumbled.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh huh.\u201dHong looked behind him before agreeing with his sister. The Black Dragon was still looking in their direction. Hong was now sure. This dragon will enjoy its freedom for a bit, before sharing some beef with him in the future.Cale ordered the two kittens who were whispering to each other.\u201cGo get the orb back.\u201dThe two siblings went to get the orb so that they could eat some more beef. Cale did not even look at the siblings, as he patted Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.\u201cGood work.\u201dToday should have been the first time Choi Han ever saved anything. There was that battle with the bandits earlier, but that was more protecting than saving.Of course, the actual events changed from saving the village people from the dragon in the novel to saving the dragon that he actually had killed in the novel, but the important thing here was that he, \u2018saved,\u2019 someone.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dChoi Han was silent for a while after calling out to Cale\u2019s name, before he finally started to speak once again.\u201cWhat if the dragon decided that living as it wants was to follow you, Cale-nim?\u201d\u201cThat will never happen.\u201d\u201cWhat if. Just hypothetically speaking.\u201d\u2018Hypothetical?\u2019Cale thought about it for a while, before lightly responding.\u201cI don\u2019t think about what ifs or the past.\u201dBut for some reason, Cale suddenly got the chills and looked behind himself for the first time since walking away from the dragon. Thankfully, the Black Dragon was not visible.Cale sighed in relief, before returning to the inn and falling asleep. That was why he did not know that the dragon used magic for the first time to become invisible, and sat at his window sill for a long time before leaving. The dragon was tightly clutching the bag of potions that Cale had given him.The next day, Cale had to deal with Choi Han\u2019s questions from early in the morning.\u201cCale-nim. There is a city coming up in a few days. Is that the middle point?\u201dIt was almost time for Choi Han to finish making up his, \u2018payment,\u2019 that Cale had talked about.It also meant that Cale was getting closer to receiving another ancient power for himself. Originally, in the novel, the eldest son of Marquis Stan\u2019s family, the one who was pushed out by Venion, would find this ancient power in about a month. It was his last glimmer of hope, but, unfortunately, it ended up being a power that he could not use.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cale recalled what Ron had said earlier, as he felt the cold water flow through his body.\u2018Young master, it is not good to take such a long night walk. This Ron was very worried about you.\u2019It made his mind clear up, even without the cold water for some reason. Cale carefully put the water back down and started to speak to Choi Han.\u201cYou took care of everything properly?\u201d\u201cYes, Cale-nim.\u201dAfter Choi Han had brought Cale back to the inn, he immediately went back to erase their tracks and create a new set of fake tracks heading toward the west.Meeeeeow. Cale looked toward the kittens that were eating jerky and yawning, and started to explain to Choi Han about the city that they would soon reach.\u201cThe name of the next city is Puzzle City. That is the middle point in our journey.\u201dOnce you get out of the Henituse territory that is surrounded by mountains, all the roads are well-paved from this small city in the Viscount\u2019s territory to the capital.\u2018That\u2019s the reason that the Henituse territory has been safe until now, even if it is a bit annoying for the merchants.\u2019Even if you have a lot of goods to sell, it would be difficult for merchants to travel to buy those goods if the roads were rough. However, the merchants pushed through this inconvenience because the roads were paved as soon as they left the Henituse territory.Furthermore, these paved roads allowed for the influential powers in the eastern half of the Roan Kingdom to gather frequently. That was why people in the capital were able to discuss many of the issues in the east, even though there were no nobles with a higher nobility than the rank of Marquis in this the east.\u201cIt took a while to get this far because our territory has a lot of mountains, but it will not take very long from here.\u201dPuzzle City was not the middle point in terms of distance, but in terms of time.\u201cBut Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI went to check the Viscount\u2019s villa on my way back.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dLooking at Cale\u2019s stoic expression, Choi Han had a slightly bitter expression as he responded.\u201cThey all seemed to be in a state of chaos. There were also soldiers and knights leaving the village.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure they went to report.\u201dAfter regaining their consciousness, they probably sent people to Venion and investigated the area around the cave. However, that did not seem to be the end of Choi Han\u2019s report.\u201cHowever.\u201d\u201cJust say it.\u201dCale started to frown, and bluntly retorted to Choi Han. Choi Han still seemed to have a bitter expression, and slowly started to speak.\u201cA part of the exit route we took from the cave was blown up. Even the trees, grass, ground, and everything around it was a mess.\u201dPlop.The kittens dropped the jerkies that were in their mouths. However, Cale was still relaxed.\u201cI\u2019m sure the dragon did it.\u201dChoi Han just stood there silently. Cale saw that, and started to smile as he stood up from his seat.Even if it is only 4 years old, the dragon was still extremely smart. It knew someone may come to the escape route, and probably decided to blow it up. Since dragons are also very sensitive to mana, it probably destroyed everything around it to destroy the magic tools in the area as well.\u201cIt\u2019s good enough that it didn\u2019t kill all of the fainted people. It\u2019s probably holding back because it is still young and still has some fear.\u201d\u201cI see. I did feel a strong amount of mana there.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look down on the dragon just because it is small. You\u2019ll regret it.\u201dDragons were said to be large animals that were extremely petty. Cale praised himself once again for leaving the dragon instead of bringing it with him, before asking Choi Han a question.\u201cYou can get out now. Are you going to be sleeping until we leave?\u201d\u201cNo. I need to go help Beacrox out.\u201d\u201cWho? Beacrox?\u201dCale gasped in shock, and quickly asked.\u201cOh, I guess you are close now?\u201dAt that moment, Cale saw Choi Han have a stoic expression for the first time. Choi Han answered very sternly.\u201cNo. We are not close at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I, I see\u2026 okay then.\u201dCale responded back with a similar expression on his face, and Choi Han silently bowed before heading out of the room. Cale gave Choi Han an order as he was opening the door to leave.\u201cAh. Tell Hans to prepare some drinks on your way out.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dChoi Han\u2019s eyes opened widely in shock as he looked back at Cale. He looked back and forth at the relaxed Cale and the clock that showed 7:00 am. Cale refreshingly answered Choi Han\u2019s silent question.\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of a hangover drink?\u201dChoi Han left without saying anything else, but Cale did not care. Even On and Hong were looking at him and seemed to be asking if he really was going to start drinking this early, but he also ignored them, and looked into the mirror.\u201cWhat a wonderful expression.\u201dHis face seemed to be extremely tired, and still slightly drunk. Cale nodded in satisfaction, before heading down to the first floor.\u2018As I expected.\u20197:00 am was early, but the day was not yet over for some people. The Vice Captain was standing there, looking like he had never even drank last night, and was having a serious conversation with someone.Cale could see a stiff Choi Han nearby. It was because the person speaking with the Vice Captain was one of the knights that Choi Han had defeated yesterday. It was only normal to stiffen up.Cale approached Choi Han, and kicked Choi Han\u2019s foot.\u201cWhy are you stiffening up like that?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dChoi Han flinched for a moment at Cale\u2019s stealthy whisper, before smiling awkwardly and quietly responding back.\u201cI thought I had used enough strength to make them unable to fight for about a day, but they are up and moving much earlier than I expected. I guess I thought the human body was much weaker than it actually is. I guess I can use more strength against humans in the future.\u201dCale turned his gaze away from Choi Han. Choi Han really fit the model of a normal main character who would happily destroy anything in his path toward justice. There was also other existences who were outside of Cale\u2019s expectations.On and Hong had followed him downstairs. The kittens had smirks on their face as they wagged their tails and peeked at the knight. Anybody could see that they were enjoying this situation.\u2018\u2026Am I the biggest coward here?\u2019As Cale was thinking about that and sat down at his table, the inn owner brought a bottle of alcohol to him.\u201cYoung master, I prepared the same alcohol you drank last night.\u201d\u201cOld man, there is something that keeps coming to my mind whenever I see you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dCale smiled at the nervous old man, and continued to speak.\u201cI think you are a really smart vendor. It\u2019s a compliment. This is perfect for a hangover drink.\u201dPong.The alcohol bottle opened with a refreshing sound, and Cale immediately poured a cup and downed it. His face almost instantly started to turn red. Cale purposefully made his eyes only half opened, and looked toward the Vice Captain. The Vice Captain was still talking to the other knight.\u201cYesterday, we had a party to relax after a long journey until here. Everybody was drinking and relaxing. Nobody left the inn. But I still don\u2019t understand why someone from the Viscount\u2019s estate would be curious about that.\u201dThe knight from the Marquis\u2019s estate seems to have introduced himself as someone from the Viscount\u2019s estate. The knight smiled at the Vice Captain\u2019s suspicious gaze, but the knight still answered back with a serious expression.\u201cThere was a thief that broke into the Viscount\u2019s villa yesterday. A couple other knights and myself were on guard, but we lost a few items to the thief. After hearing that people from Count Henituse\u2019s estate were here in the village, we came to see if the thief had stolen from the Count as well.\u201d\u2018Thief my ass. Well, I guess a dragon thief is a thief as well.\u2019Cale took a gulp directly from the bottle while thinking about that. At that moment, he made eye contact with the knight who was at the Viscount\u2019s villa yesterday.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dThe knight immediately bowed and turned his gaze away. The Vice Captain looked toward Cale awkwardly, before letting out a fake cough and then confidently and loudly answering.\u201cAhem. Our young master is drinking because his day turns out better if he drinks in the morning. Furthermore, it is a hangover drink. He is the type of person who drinks to cure his hangover caused from drinking too much the night before.\u201dCale glared at the Vice Captain, because he could not tell whether the Vice Captain was mocking him or coming up with an excuse for him, before taking another drink.\u201cI see. What an interesting young master.\u201dThe knight responded to the Vice Captain\u2019s words positively, before respectfully bowing toward Cale.\u2018I guess this should lessen their suspicion of us.\u2019Cale felt like they should no longer have any reason to be suspected by the Marquis\u2019s knight who came to the inn so early in the morning. The dragon happened to disappear while Cale\u2019s envoy was here, and they were leaving the morning after, but there weren\u2019t many reasons to suspect them.Venion\u2019s remaining subordinates here will think about the six starred outfits that the attackers were wearing, the ones that seemed to represent a certain organization, as well as the tracks that were leading to the west. Most importantly, however, is that they would never think that someone like Cale, who was called a trash, would be able to do something like that.\u201cThen I wish you a safe journey as you continue on today.\u201dIn addition, there was no way they could hold the eldest son of a Count from leaving when they didn\u2019t have the Marquis, Venion, or even the Viscount with them. Especially when that noble was heading to the capital under the order of the crown.\u2018Who would think that a noble that is drinking on his way to a summons from the crown would be normal?\u2019It really was good to be trash. Cale continued to drink with satisfaction.\u2018I\u2019m sure Venion would not suspect us, even after finding out what happened.\u2019Venion and Marquis Stan were probably the people who knew better than anyone else that there was absolutely no relationship between Count Henituse and the secret organization. That was especially the case when it came to the dragon.Cale watched the knight leave the inn before drinking the honey lemon tea Ron had put in front of him.\u201cRon.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d\u201cHoney tea really seems to be the best to cure a hangover.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201dRon smiled as he looked at Cale, but Cale looked away and tried to calm his stomach. Once Cale no longer felt sick from drinking too much, they started on their way once more.Their next destination was Puzzle City. It was the city that was the center of the transportation of goods in the East, and it was pretty famous for the number of rock towers around the city.Cale needed to find an unfinished rock tower in Puzzle City.\u201cAre we camping out today?\u201dOn took a bite of the jerky as she asked Cale. Cale nodded his head.\u201cYes. Starting today, we will be camping outside every so often.\u201dCale had set a pretty filled schedule from here on as well. It was because he wanted to have enough time in Puzzle City. He turned away from the kitten siblings, who were whispering quietly to each other, and looked outside the carriage window.\u2018The Vitality of the Heart.\u2019That was the name of the ancient power that would strengthen the Indestructible Shield. This was a power that was focused on restoration and vitality.\u2018That was why the eldest son was looking for it.\u2019Taylor, the eldest son of the Marquis, who had lost his position as heir. He was the only good person in the Marquis\u2019s family, but the lower half of his body had become paralyzed because of Venion\u2019s schemes.Taylor had rummaged through all sorts of texts to find a power that would cure him. He happens to find an ancient text in an old bookstore in the process, and, although it was difficult to decipher the ancient text, he manages to decipher a few words after putting in a lot of hard work.Restoration. Rock Tower.Those two things became clues for Taylor who immediately headed to Puzzle City, which could also be called Rock Tower City. He was probably at Puzzle City right now. In the novel, he would find the ancient power in about a month from now.\u2018But it was useless.\u2019The, \u2018Vitality of the Heart,\u2019 was unable to restore an already injured body. It only was able to restore any injuries recieved after earning the power. There was also a limit on how much could be restored, as well as a cost to pay for any restorations.Taylor fell into despair after learning about that fact. He had no time, and that ancient power was his last hope. It was because Taylor did not know when Venion would come to kill him.\u2018He dies a month after finding the power.\u2019Taylor ends up dying by an unknown organization while the capital was in a state of chaos from the terror incident. Of course, Venion was responsible for sending that organization after Taylor.The reason Cale remembered this side character, that seemed to have an even smaller role than the original Cale in the novel, was because of the strong friendship Taylor had with his friend.The crazy priestess. She was Taylor\u2019s friend and the only person who survives Taylor\u2019s assassination. She kills half of the assassins in anger, and ends up becoming excommunicated by the temple. She ends up with a large injury on her back from the incident and confidently tells the temple about what she had done.\u2018I acted as a human rather than following the will of the lord. I believe that is the right thing to do.\u2019She then continued on after that.\u2018I am now free!\u2019That is when she starts to be called the crazy priestess by others. Her specialty was using the strength of the God of Death for curses. The temple had excommunicated her, but her god did not throw her away.When the war broke out in the novel, she became famous, even though she was not a hero, because of how she helped to heal the injured.\u2018I think it will be different this time.\u2019There was a good chance that Taylor would not die in a month. Venion was going to be busy dealing with the dragon incident and sucking up to the Marquis. He probably would need to focus on his younger siblings rather than his paralyzed older brother to maintain his status as the heir to the Marquis title.\u2018And since I will be taking Taylor\u2019s last hope away, I will need to give him a new hope.\u2019Although the Vitality of the Heart was an ancient power that Taylor did not need, Cale was not such a bad guy to take someone\u2019s last hope away.Cale was also curious to know about what that combination of Taylor and the Crazy Priestess could achieve if they managed to live longer. He thought that the two of them could change the Marquis\u2019s estate. If that could happen, that would be better for Cale in the long run.However, something that he suddenly thought about made Cale stiffen his expression.\u2018Even Beacrox struggled under her curse right?\u2019Once Cale thought about the struggles the torture expert Beacrox had with the priestess, he stopped thinking about her right away. He decided to stop thinking about the good-natured and citizen-caring noble Taylor as well.\u2018They don\u2019t mesh well with me.\u2019They were different types of people than Cale. They were good people who were loyal and trusted each other deeply. Cale preferred Ron or Beacrox to those kinds of people.\u2018\u2026No. How could I ever think about such terrible thoughts.\u2019Cale quickly stopped thinking about Ron and Beacrox as well.At that moment, Cale looked down after feeling something tapping at his leg. He could see the golden pupils of the kittens shining, as the kittens started to speak.\u201cI heard from Hans earlier.\u201d\u201cHans said.\u201dHans still didn\u2019t know that the kittens were Cat Tribe kittens, and continued to say all sorts of things in front of the kittens. The kittens seemed to want to tell him something they had heard Hans say.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe siblings seemed to have gotten used to Cale\u2019s rude way of asking, and started to speak.\u201cIf you make a wish at a rock tower, it will come true.\u201d\u201cHe said the rock towers were pretty.\u201d\u201cI want to go. But it\u2019s okay if it is too annoying.\u201d\u201cI want to go with you, but it\u2019s okay if it is too difficult.\u201dCale blankly stared at the fidgety kittens before casually asking.\u201cWhat kind of wish do you have?\u201dHong shook his fur, that was now healthier and shinier thanks to getting good treatment from Hans, and shouted out with excitement.\u201cThat everybody, including my new little brother-\u201d\u201cDismissed.\u201dCale immediately started to ignore the kittens, and turned away from them. The carriage stopped at the same time. They had arrived at the location of their campsite for the evening.\u201cLooks like we are camping out again starting today.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dCale answered Hans\u2019s statement, before looking around their campsite. The wind from the forest blew by his head. Cale spent the night with a pretty relaxed mind.The next morning.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dCale stared at the dead deer that was at the border of their campsite. It had been hunted recently. Hans reported to Cale, who just continued to stare at the deer.\u201cSomeone left it here on our campsite.\u201dHans pointed next to the deer. Cale was looking at that spot as well. On the ground was a drawing of a fork and a knife.It was as if someone had left the deer there for them to eat. Cale suddenly had an odd thought. He then turned his gaze toward his companions. The kitten siblings in Choi Han\u2019s arms, as well as Choi Han himself, were all smiling while looking at him.\u2018\u2026I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019He had a really bad feeling about it.An individual that could speak, but could not write, had left the deer for them.Also, it was an individual that Choi Han, the person on watch last night, clearly knew was there, but pretended not to see.\u2018\u2026I have a bad feeling it was the dragon.\u2019He turned his head back to look at Choi Han, On, and Hong, who were still looking at him, and seriously warned them.\u201cWe are going to pretend like we don\u2019t know.\u201dMeeeow.Meeow.The two siblings seemed to be mocking him, but Cale pretended to not know about it. However, a new ingredient was delivered to them every time Cale and crew camped outside. Wild hog, rabbits, and all sorts of fruits. Cale was now sure about the existence of the dragon following behind him.Cale then arrived at Puzzle City with that confirmation in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Small.\u201dCale nodded at On and Hong\u2019s words, and looked outside the carriage.\u2018It won\u2019t follow me into the city, right?\u2019According to Choi Han, the Black Dragon would follow them from a far distance, before coming by in the early morning to drop the food off and then running away.\u201cIsn\u2019t it cute? The dragon seems like a little kid that hasn\u2019t lose its innocence, even after living such a terrible life.\u201d\u2018...Not really.\u2019That was what Cale was thinking as Choi Han spoke to him with amusement. If Choi Han had seen the dragon blow a mountain away, he would not be saying things like, \u2018Cute,\u2019 to describe it.Cale didn\u2019t know why the dragon was doing this, even though it said that it hated humans. It was really overwhelming for Cale. This was not the way he was expecting things to go.Since it was still young, Cale thought the dragon would stay away from the Marquis\u2019s territory and create its own lair to develop its strength. Cale was hoping that, after growing stronger, that the dragon would destroy the Marquis\u2019s estate before the war broke out in the continent.That would be helpful in keeping the Henituse territory peaceful for a longer period of time.\u201cTsk.\u201dCale clicked his tongue, and the kittens, who were excitedly looking out the window, flinched before approaching him. It seemed like they had seen something odd outside, and had come to ask.\u201cEach house has a rock tower in front of it.\u201d\u201cVery very weird.\u201dCale just casually answered.\u201cThis is the city of rock towers.\u201dPuzzle City was famous for the ancient ruins with a lot of rock towers, but it was also famous for the fact that each house had small rock towers in front of them.The people in this city made a small groove outside of their windows to put a small rock tower on top of it. It really shouldn\u2019t be called a rock tower, because it was made with less than ten rocks, but the rock towers were formed in different shapes based on the personality of the home owners.That was why it was only natural that the luxurious inn that Cale arrived at also had a rock tower in front of it.\u201cWill we be staying here?\u201dHans quickly responded to Cale\u2019s question, as they followed behind the inn owner. Hans seemed to be very excited, as he was walking with the kitten siblings in his arms.\u201cYes sir. We have reserved two days for Choi Han-nim, and have agreed to pay for the rest of the group depending on how long we end up staying here.\u201dRon flinched for a moment at Hans\u2019s words before quickly following behind with the magic box in his hand. Hans continued to speak.\u201cWe arrived right before the Rock Tower Festival season, so the room was not that expensive.\u201dThe Rock Tower Festival. Puzzle City was currently busy preparing for next week\u2019s Rock Tower Festival. Cale just let out what he was thinking without giving it any thought.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there are a lot of rocks here, but the rock towers are quite interesting. Very odd.\u201d\u201cI know the reason for that.\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019Cale peeked toward Hans, who had responded to his mumblings.\u201cThere is a sad yet thought provoking story that has been passed down through the ages.\u201d\u201cStop right now if it is going to be long.\u201dCale really didn\u2019t care about it. However, Hans continued to speak, as he had probably determined that the story was not very long. The group that had entered Cale\u2019s room watched as the attendant stepped out of the room and then had to listen to Hans\u2019s story.\u201cThis story, well, this legend, is about something that happened in ancient times.\u201d\u201cAncient times?\u201dClick.The attendant had closed the door behind her and only Cale\u2019s group was left in his room. Cale responded to the words, \u2018Ancient times.\u2019\u201cYes. Ancient times.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201dThe kitten siblings in Hans\u2019s arms were wagging their tails, as if they were interested in the story, and looked up at him. Ron just silently poured a cup of lemonade from the bottle he carried in with the magic box and handed it to Cale.Cale held the cup of lemonade in his hands and sat down on the couch with his legs crossed and motioned to Hans with his chin. He was telling Hans to hurry up and speak.\u201cAhem. This city supposedly fell out of the grace of a god in the past.\u201d\u2018Falling out of grace?\u2019Cale did not know anything about this story.\u201cThis is my first time hearing about it.\u201d\u201cThat is because young master has not studied history.\u201d\u201c...You seem to enjoy talking back to me these days. Are you going to keep talking back like that? Hmm?\u201dHans quickly turned his gaze away from Cale.\u201cIt is only natural for a great butler to inform their master about things that the master does not know.\u201dHans started to speak about the ancient times.\u201cI do not know why this city fell out of the grace of a god. However, that is apparently when some of the people in this city started to gather together to build rock towers. It seemed to have been an act of worship to reach out to the god that had abandoned them.\u201d\u201cDid it work?\u201dHans sternly responded to Cale\u2019s question.\u201cNo.\u201dThe god did not listen to them.\u201cApparently, none of the prayers went through. That is why the present day Puzzle City does not have a single temple.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to worship a god who has abandoned me. Is that it?\u201d\u201cDing ding ding! Our young master truly is smart and does not need to study at all.\u201d\u201c...You want to get punched?\u201dHans turned away from Cale to look at a far away mountain and continued to speak.\u201cAhem. Anyways, they have rock towers instead of temples. The rock towers represent a promise that the people made after all of that. It was a promise between the people, as well as a promise with themselves.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of promise?\u201dHans started to explain an odd rule that was followed in Puzzle City.\u201cA human who has had their wish granted will destroy their rock tower.\u201dCale started to smile.\u201cWhat an interesting city.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Since they were abandoned by their god, they needed to achieve everything with their own strength. The act of destroying their rock tower represents, \u2018overcoming the odds.\u2019Cale liked the act of destroying the rock tower very much. He then recalled the numerous rock towers in front of the houses.\u201cThe rock towers are not created to seek help from a god.\u201d\u201cRight. It is more of a representation of their own determination.\u201dThis kind of rock tower held a lot of importance, even if you never got to destroy it.\u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t the god granting their wish in the end.\u201d\u201cYes. You are right. Although it is sad that they were abandoned, this story also gives people a lot of hope.\u201dCale casually gave an ordered to Hans who was responding to him.\u201cLook down.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dSeeing Hans looking confused, Cale pointed to Hans\u2019s chest with his finger.\u201cLooks like the kittens are angry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dGasp. Hans looked down and gasped as his eyes opened widely. The kittens were showing their teeth in anger. The golden pupils staring at Hans were vicious.\u201cAigoo. Why are our kitten-nims so angry? Should I go bring you some more jerky?\u201dHans started to smile as he put the kittens down from his chest. Since he still had no idea that they were beast people, he just assumed they were angry because they were hungry. However, the kittens were not angry because of that. Cale recalled the things that the siblings had told him earlier.\u2018I heard from Hans earlier.\u2019\u2018Hans said.\u2019\u2018If you make a wish at a rock tower, it will come true.\u2019\u2018He said the rock towers were pretty.\u2019Tap. Tap.On seemed to be angry, as she was tapping on the floor with her paw, while Hong was tapping on the floor with his tail. They were angry that Hans had lied to them about the rock tower, but Hans seemed to have gotten the wrong message.\u201cAigoo, our precious kitten-nims. I will go get some delicious snacks for you! Young master, may I go get something for them?\u201d\u201cYou can stay out as well.\u201d\u201cI will be back really quickly.\u201dHans said that he would hurry back, but he still made sure the things he brought for Cale were neatly organized, before heading out like the wind as soon as it was done.\u201cRon, you can go rest as well.\u201dRon was still left in the room. Ron turned toward Cale and started to smile.\u2018I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019Cale really hated that old man\u2019s smile. His smile made Cale even more uncomfortable than normal. Ron approached the couch Cale was on, before starting to speak.\u201cWill Choi Han-nim be leaving in two days?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale suddenly had a thought and started to smile as he asked.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want to send him away? Do you want to go with him?\u201dRon\u2019s benign smile became even bigger.\u201cWhy would I leave you behind and go somewhere else, young master? I like being next to you.\u201dThis gave Cale the chills.\u201cIt is just that it is disappointing that Choi Han-nim will not be going with us all the way to the capital. I will need to speak with him as much as possible before he leaves. Beacrox will probably be sad to see him go.\u201dCale\u2019s expression became a bit better after hearing the rest of Ron\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t really pay attention to it because it was annoying, but it looks like a level of friendship had developed between Ron, Choi Han, and Beacrox.Choi Han was difficult to read, but if he really hated someone, he would not even speak to them. Cale thought about his plan, and started to smile mischievously as he answered.\u201cWell, you can see each other again at the capital, since you\u2019ll be moving together.\u201d\u2018The three of you can leave this kingdom and go to Rosalyn\u2019s kingdom. What do you think? Wonderful, right?\u2019Cale did not say that part out loud, as he started to smirk while Ron started to smile even brighter.\u201cI look forward to when we are all together with Choi Han-nim in the capital. This old man\u2019s wish is that everybody arrives there safely.\u201dCale did not believe anything Ron was saying. \u2018Looking forward to it,\u2019 or, \u2018wishing that everybody arrives there safely.\u2019 Those type of emotions would not fly with this old man.The kittens also snorted while looking at Ron. On and Hong found it annoying that Ron kept trying to teach them assassination skills that they already knew behind Cales back.\u201c...You can leave now.\u201dCale easily got rid of Ron from the room.\u201cHans is a liar!\u201d\u201cI trusted that butler!\u201dThe kitten siblings finally let out their anger while Cale was ignored them by looking out of the window.Cale was looking in the direction of a cave in the corner of Puzzle City. This cave was the location of the incomplete rock tower and the, \u2018Vitality of the Heart.\u2019 There should be a small house in that cave.\u2018Didn\u2019t it say the person lived until they were 150 years old?\u2019This was a power that an ancient being left after naturally dying from old age. The deceased person thought his power to be a curse. Cale got up from his seat, fixed his clothes a bit, and opened the door.\u201cAigoo!\u201dHans happened to be right outside the door. Seeing the deputy butler, who had run back with his arms full of jerky, Cale started to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s go see the rock tower.\u201dThe kittens\u2019 ears started to twitch. Cale smirked internally at the kittens, who ran toward him like they were never angry to start, and picked the people that would go with him.\u201cIt will just be us and Choi Han. Oh, bring On and Hong with you too.\u201dThe human who died at the age of 150 had wanted to finish a rock tower in this Wind-Gathering Cave.\u2018It was wood last time, now it is wind?\u2019The center of the cave has a hurricane that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. The old man had spent over 100 years trying to build a rock tower in the eye of that hurricane. However, he failed.Well, the old man always destroyed his rock tower whenever it looked like he was going to finish. He repeated that over and over until he died one day after stacking it back up about half way.Just what wish did that ancient old man have? Cale didn\u2019t really care. He just planned on carefully looking at one thing while they were out looking at rock towers today.\u2018Might as well make it look good if I\u2019m going to build it anyways.\u2019Since he had to do it anyways, he was going to make it look good. He also had to pay attention to some people, just in case, at the Rock Tower Ruins.A bit later, Cale, the two kittens, Choi Han, and Hans arrived at the entrance of the Rock Tower Ruins. They didn\u2019t bring their carriage that showed the symbol of the Henituse family, and Cale had a hat on as well, using the excuse that he did not like the sunlight.\u2018They really are still here.\u2019He was able to locate the people that he was looking for as soon as they entered into the ruins. Cale stealthily hid behind Choi Han and Hans.At a bit of a distance was a casually dressed man and woman. The man was in a wheelchair, with the woman pushing the wheelchair and heading out of the entrance of the Ruins, which was also the exit.They didn\u2019t notice Cale\u2019s stealthy gaze and casually left the ruins. The man turned his head slightly toward the woman and asked.\u201cWhy did you want to come here today?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a message from the lord or just complete bullshit, but I\u2019ve had the same dream for a couple of days that I needed to come here. My dream said that our future benefactor will show up if we came to the ruins. Something about how even the lord didn\u2019t know how that benefactor will act, other than the fact that they will be coming to the ruins today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s even a person that the lord cannot predict?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Half of the things the lord says is bullshit. Complete bullshit.\u201dThe woman with short brown hair vented with annoyance.\u201cBullshit? It is the word of the lord. Plus, wasn\u2019t it a secret that you can hear messages from the lord?\u201dThe responding man was the eldest son of Marquis Stan\u2019s family, Taylor Stan.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there are any priests in Puzzle City. And who cares about the word of the lord? Does the lord feed us? How can there be a benefactor for people like us? Absolutely bogus. I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201dThe woman who looked annoyed was Taylor\u2019s close friend, Cage, the woman who will eventually be called the Crazy Priestess. Taylor responded back to Cage with a serious expression.\u201cCage, I suddenly feel like drinking beer.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m craving smoked pork.\u201dThey looked at each other with serious expressions. Taylor pointed forward with his finger, and seriously responded to Cage.\u201cWhat a wonderful combination. Let\u2019s go. Push! It\u2019ll be my treat!\u201d\u201cAigoo, your treat?! This priestess will do her best to escort you there.\u201dThe two of them started to laugh as they started to move.Cale could not hear their conversation because he was far away, but he was doing his best to remember the faces of these two individuals, who were still able to laugh while in the middle of some terrible situations.\u2018Now that I\u2019ve confirmed what they look like, I just need to make sure to avoid them.\u2019Since they didn\u2019t know who he was, Cale just had to make sure he avoided them in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was something he had learned from the dragon.\u2018Unless their lord has nothing to do and reveals me to them, there is no way that they will recognize me.\u2019It was impossible for them to learn of his identity. How great was that? He should have done everything anonymously until now. Cale stepped into the ruins feeling like a massive weight had been lifted off his chest.He could see people praying all around the area.At that moment, Hans stealthily approached Cale and whispered to him.\u201cI just saw the eldest son of Marquis Stan\u2019s household.\u201d\u201c\u2026How do you know about that person?\u201dCale was truly surprised. Hans smiled before pointing to his eyes.\u201cPretty much any and all information about the nobles is in my head. I could see a man being pushed on a wheelchair. It was weird that there was only one person with him, but I was able to see that there was a red snake crest on the wheelchair.\u201d\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re better than you look.\u201d\u201cThank you?\u201dHans shrugged his shoulders with a satisfied expression as he finished his report. He then asked Cale.\u201cWhat do you plan on doing?\u201dCale could feel the left side of his face heating up, and looked in that direction. Choi Han was looking at him. Cale shook his head and answered both of them.\u201cIgnore them.\u201dBoth of them nodded their heads without saying anything else. Only then did their tour officially start. After looking around, Cale was shocked at the appearance of the rock towers in the ruins.\u201cThey are \u2026\u201dCale seemed to be in disbelief.\u201cUglier than I had expected.\u201dCale could not understand the ancient sense of style. He was expecting piles of rocks, but there were rock towers of all kinds shapes in the ruins.They looked interesting. However, they were definitely not beautiful. Cale peeked at the kittens in Hans\u2019s arms. They seemed to be extremely disappointed as well.However, there was someone who seemed to be more serious than Cale expected. Choi Han had his head bowed like the other people who were praying, and seemed to be praying as well.\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s praying to return to Korea.\u2019Choi Han had grown up in a happy family environment. He was a different kind of person than Cale, Kim Rok Soo. Choi Han had grown up in a happy family with positive influences. That was why he was able to survive in a disastrous situation while still remaining a good person.Cale was staring at Choi Han when Choi Han lifted his head up and made eye contact with him.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have a question and something to report.\u201dCale had a bad feeling about this.\u201cStart with your question.\u201dChoi Han seemed to be thinking about something, as he looked toward the rock towers standing in this wide plain and started to speak.\u201cCale-nim, are you not going to make a wish?\u201d\u2018Is that what he wants to know?\u2019Cale just casually answered.\u201cI don\u2019t do things like making wishes.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cIt makes you have higher expectations.\u201dChoi Han, Hans, and even the kittens all turned to look at Cale. Cale looked at the rock towers like Choi Han had done, and slowly continued to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to live without high expectations.\u201dIt feels great if you scratch a lottery ticket hoping for $1 and end up winning $5, but if you scratch it hoping to win the grand prize and only end up with $5, you are bound to get annoyed.Tap. Cale turned his gaze after feeling the tap on his shoulder, only to see deputy butler Hans smiling and starting to speak.\u201cYou are right, young master. There is no such thing as dreams or hope in this world.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just stop talking.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dHans responded loudly, but seemed to be a bit disappointed as well, as he took the lead with the kittens. Cale leisurely followed behind Hans, when Choi Han quickly approached him and whispered in a voice that Hans could not here.Choi Han had not given his report yet.\u201cThe dragon has entered the city.\u201d\u201cIgnore.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dCale took a look around. The dragon must have made itself invisible, as he could not see it. The only thing he could see was the people praying toward the rock towers. The Rock Tower Festival was still a week away, but there was still a large amount of people here. Cale\u2019s gaze turned to the opposite direction of the rock towers in the plains.The upscale area, the area that the wealthiest citizens in Puzzle City resides. Behind that area was a small mountain, and somewhere on that mountain was the grave of the person who had lived until they were 150 years old.The next day, Cale was ready to head to the grave. Naturally, he had to get rid of the humans and the kittens who wanted to follow him. Thankfully, everybody stopped voicing their complaints once he said only a single person was going to come with him.\u201cI will only be taking Choi Han with me.\u201dChoi Han was the strongest person there. With Choi Han tagging along, both the Vice Captain and Hans had nothing to say.The Vice Captain just frowned and said he needed to train the knights, before he quickly started to gather them. While Cale was watching the knights who were following behind the Vice Captain with looks of despair on their faces, Hans just said one more thing before disappearing.\u201cI will take care of our kitten-nims.\u201dCale turned away from Hans, who seemed to be very excited about being with the kittens, and headed out of the inn. Choi Han followed behind him.\u201cAre we doing something again today?\u201d\u201cAgain? Someone might get the wrong idea if they heard you.\u201dChoi Han did not respond. Cale did not care however, and just headed toward the mountain behind the upscale area and continued to speak.\u201cI need to go to that mountain over there. You can just wait for me at the mountain entrance.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dChoi Han did not say anything else. Cale preferred someone like this. Choi Han did not ask Cale any questions. He was someone who seemed to follow Cale, but did not have any curiosity about what Cale did. This was probably only possible because Choi Han thought that he could figure it out if he really wanted to, and because he thought that he would not be in danger no matter what Cale ended up doing.Cale arrived at the small mountain after passing through the stereotypical upscale area, before stopping after hearing Choi Han call out to him.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI know. I was the one who told you to leave tomorrow.\u201dChoi Han made eye contact with Cale, who was standing impatiently at the mountain entrance. Cale was someone who said that he, Choi Han, was enough for protection. Choi Han had been thinking about this act of protecting the last few days.\u201cI\u2019ve been debating this for a while, but there is something I need to tell you.\u201dThe report about the dragon yesterday was not really what Choi Han had wanted to report. He hesitated for a moment, before looking back toward Cale and starting to speak. Choi Han\u2019s gaze was looking past Cale\u2019s shoulder to a tree near the entrance of the mountain.\u201cMr. Ron is a dangerous person.\u201dCale flinched for a moment at this straight that landed on him without any warnings. Should he pretend to know or pretend not to know? He quickly made up his mind. Cale had not expected a question like this, but he calmly responded back.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYou are not surprised? There is a dangerous stench of blood on him. He is a strong person who has shed a lot of blood. At first, I thought that Cale-nim knew about it already and still had Mr. Ron by your side.\u201dBut if Cale had known, he would have taken the strong Ron with him to rescue the dragon. But Cale had not done that. Choi Han thought that to mean that Cale either did not know about Ron\u2019s strength or did not trust Ron, but there was no way Cale wouldn\u2019t trust someone who had been with him for 18 years.That was why Choi Han had come to the conclusion that Cale was not aware of Ron\u2019s strength.\u201cBut neither Cale-nim nor anybody else seemed to know about Mr. Ron\u2019s strength.\u201dChoi Han had debated about this for a while. Honestly speaking, the fact that Cale had said that he did not have any expectations made him decide not to say anything about Ron. However, the fact that Cale had chosen him to be the guard today made Choi Han feel guilty.\u201cThat was why I thought I needed to tell Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cOh really? I didn\u2019t know Ron was strong.\u201dChoi Han asked once more after hearing Cale\u2019s calm response.\u201cWill you still keep him around you? He seems like he is an evil person.\u201dCale snorted at Choi Han\u2019s words. Keep Ron around him? Cale was planning on pushing Ron over to Choi Han the moment they arrived at the capital.\u201cWhether it is you or Ron.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cYou say that he has a dangerous strength, but why do you leave Ron alone?\u201d\u201cThat is because-.\u201dChoi Han suddenly could not say anything.\u201cIt is probably because he has not done anything to you.\u201dChoi Han could not retort Cale\u2019s words. There was the initial misunderstanding had that led to their small battle, but Ron had helped him find a sword after that, and even helped take care of the issue with Harris Village.Cale silently observed Choi Han.It was not just to Choi Han. Ron did not do anything to anybody. The only thing that Ron did was giving Cale lemonade every so often or making fun of Cale with rabbit meat. But that was nothing.\u201cRon has been my servant for 18 years.\u201dNo matter what, Ron was dedicated to his act as a servant. Even the Vice Captain, who cared a lot about hierarchy, did not get angry when Ron, a servant, was walking shoulder to shoulder with him. Even deputy butler Hans did not get angry when Ron did his job for him.It was because Ron was skilled and well-liked throughout the estate.\u201cDo you hate Ron?\u201dChoi Han shook his head after debating it for a moment.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI just thought it would be better for you to know that he was a dangerous person, and thus decided to report.\u201d\u201cWhether it is you or Ron.\u201dChoi Han looked at Cale after hearing that once more.\u201cYou are both the same to me. In that aspect, you are dangerous as well.\u201dCale looked at Choi Han with a stoic expression and continued to speak.\u201cYou are strong as well.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dChoi Han let out a gasp. Cale didn\u2019t know the reason behind it, but continued to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to me.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know the reason, but Ron, who had come over from the Eastern Continent, was living in the Henituse territory while hiding his identity. If someone like that was to touch the son of the Count? That would spread like wildfire in the kingdom.Ron was someone who did not care about anything or anyone else, other than his son and himself. So why would someone like that cause a ruckus? Cale was just scared because he knew that Ron was a dangerous old man. He wanted to get rid of that dangerous old man as soon as possible so that he could live in peace.\u201cAs long as he is my servant, he is just my servant. Just like you are Choi Han, who needs to pay me back.\u201dCale checked his watch. The strength of the wind in the cave was different based on the time of day. He needed to hurry.\u201cYou have nothing else to say, right? Don\u2019t follow me.\u201dChoi Han silently nodded his head in respond. Cale did not even look back as he headed to the small mountain.After seeing that he could no longer see Cale, Choi Han looked back at the tree at the mountain entrance and started to speak.\u201cYou heard him, right?\u201dRon smoothly jumped off the tree. He glared at Choi Han and started to smile. A blunt voice started to flow out of Ron\u2019s mouth.\u201cI changed his poopy diapers and raised him since he was young.\u201dThat was the truth.Choi Han stood in front of the path to the mountain and started to speak.\u201cCale-nim had said that nobody is to follow him from here on.\u201d\u201cI know, you little punk.\u201dRon turned his back to the mountain with no regrets. After hearing that Cale was only going with Choi Han, and even leaving the Cat Tribe children behind, Ron had followed, just in case something happened.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dThey say that you get more fickle the older you get, and this fickleness was such a pain. Ron walked back to the inn at a much slower pace than when he had left, and Choi Han watched Ron disappear before sitting down on a boulder to wait for Cale to return.Cale was standing in front of a cave just off of the mountain path. The cave entrance was covered with vines, such that it would be difficult to find unless you were looking carefully.\u201cDamn it.\u201dCale started to frown.The cave entrance was pretty small. He looked down at his clothes. He had worn simple clothes, but they were still baggy.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale let out a long sigh before crawling into the cave. Whether it was the man-eating tree or this cave, everything related to ancient powers seemed to be crazy. The ground by the cave entrance now had the traces of Cale crawling in.A moment later, there was a small reptile footprint on the same spot.Cale could see the cave becoming wider after crawling in for about five minutes.\u2018Taylor must have been really desperate. He crawled all the way in here, even with his disabled lower body.\u2019Since you had to stack the rock tower with your own strength, the eldest son Taylor had to personally come here. What took Cale five minutes to do probably took Taylor much, much longer.Cale stood back up once it was wide enough and started to walk farther in. The farther he went in, the clearer the noise in his ear became.Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish. Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish.It was the sound of the wind. The sound that appeared when the winds were hitting each other became louder as he walked farther into the cave. Finally, Cale located some cloth and a pillar that was probably a hut a long time ago.After taking a single look at it, Cale continued to walk farther inside.Swiiiiiiiiiiiish.The sound of the wind became even stronger. Boom. Boom. He could even hear the wind crashing into the cave walls like a giant fist. Cale started to walk even faster.\u2018The wind. I wonder if it will sound like this when I get the, \u2018Sound of the Wind,\u2019 ancient power later.\u2019Shield. Then Recovery. Then quick feet. That was Cale\u2019s plan of action. Cale finally had to stop walking after thinking about the next ancient power he would be trying to get.It wasn\u2019t that he stopped walking, it was that he was forced to stop walking.\u201cWow.\u201dThis was even worse than Cale had expected.A large underground area had appeared in front of Cale. At the same time, a vicious wind tornado filled his gaze.Boom, boom!The rocks on the cave walls were slowly crumbling because of the tornado. There were quite a bit of rocks on the ground that let Cale know that this area was consistently getting larger.Cale looked back and forth between the underground area and the path that he traveled to get here. He felt like he would be pushed back by the wind if he went inside. Well, not just pushed back, but smashed against the wall, which would probably seriously injure him.That was how strong the wind was.\u201cMm.\u201dOf course, the center of that tornado will be calm, as it is the eye of the storm.\u2018I guess it would have been impossible for Taylor without Cage\u2019s help.\u2019He now understood why the novel said the two of them had struggled for a whole week. However, Cale started to smile. It was now going to be a battle against time.Cale stepped into the underground area, into the vicious tornado, without any hesitation. Cale\u2019s red hair started to flutter along with his clothes.At the same time\u2026\u201cN, no! You will get hurt! You are extremely weak!\u201dThe dragon appeared at the back of the path and shouted urgently.Also at the same time \u2026\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThe dragon could see a large shield with silver wings appear and surround Cale.The wings, that were shining so brightly that it could be called holy, surrounded Cale while the large shield blocked the wind. The shield and the wings were keeping Cale safe.Cale turned around. His eyes opened widely as his gaze landed on the dragon.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201dThe Black Dragon could not say anything in response.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While Cale was watching the dragon in disbelief, he could hear a quiet voice piercing through the wind to reach his ear.\u201c\u2026I was \u2026 just passing by.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s back flinched after hearing Cale click his tongue, but Cale did not have time to pay attention to the dragon. The cave\u2019s wind had a cycle of 3 hours of strong wind and 3 hours of weak wind. This was the moment that the wind started to get weaker. Of course, it would still become stronger the closer he got to the center.Swiiiiiiiiiiiiish.\u201cQuite scary.\u201dThe wind was still pretty strong to be called the, \u2018weak phase.\u2019 The novel mentioned that the 150 year old man walked through this strong wind to get to the rock tower.Cale turned his gaze back to the center of the cave. The large underground area. In the middle of the tornado was a half-stacked rock tower. It looked like there were no winds over there. Next to the half-stacked rock tower were numerous other rocks.\u2018I need to stack all of those rocks up.\u2019The issue was getting to the tower. Stacking the rocks would not be a problem.Cale looked over the shield and the wings surrounding him, before taking a step forward.Tang. Tang. The rough wind clashed against the shield. Even though the silver shield was transparent, it sounded like the wind was hitting a real metal shield.That noise made the Black Dragon that was looking away slowly turn around to look at Cale.\u201c\u2026But you are weak\u2026\u201dThe Cale that the dragon could see was having a difficult time, even though the shield and wings were protecting him. The wind that could not be blocked by the shield and wings was making his clothes flutter. The wind that seeped through the bottom of the shield made him stop moving every so often as well.However, Cale continued to step forward one step at a time. Then the dragon saw it.Cale was smiling. This human, that was nothing compared to that strong tornado, the same human that was weaker than even the kittens he was traveling with, the human that was the weakest out of everybody he was traveling with, was smiling while pushing through this wind.The dragon had never seen such a silver shield before. He had never seen such wings either. The dragon took a look at his own wings. It was very different from his wings. It was extremely beautiful. The dragon was curious as to what that power might be.However, the dragon was focused not on the holy and magnificent shield nor wings. Its full attention was on the smiling Cale.And the target of the gaze, Cale, was continuing to smile.\u2018It\u2019s doable. It\u2019s comfortable.\u2019It was a bit difficult and slow because of the wind, but it was actually a breeze. Compared to how Beacrox was almost killed by Ron while being taught his sword art, this was child\u2019s play.This made Cale once again feel like it really was best to earn something without putting in much effort.There were no physical or mental strain endured when using the Indestructible Shield. There would be a short strain if it was to break, but it was not in any danger of breaking right now.\u2018It just gets pushed back.\u2019The shield just got pushed back if the wind was strong. Honestly speaking, Cale had expected to be pushed back multiple times. That was why he had originally lowered the strength of the shield and enlarged it as much as possible. He had been planning on slowly shrinking the size of the shield whenever he got pushed back.However, this shield was working better than Cale had expected. That made Cale a bit smug, but when he had reached about the halfway mark to the center of the tornado, he had to get rid of all side thoughts.The novel had said that you would hear a voice once you got close to the center. It was supposed to be the voice of an old man.Cale was waiting for that voice. The tornado was supposed to get stronger once the voice started to appear.I regret it.He could hear the voice. But it was a bit odd.Ahem, I regret it.It was a sad old man.\u201cTsk tsk.\u201dCale clicked his tongue. None of these ancient powers were normal. Why did Taylor think the old man\u2019s voice was sincere? Cale could not understand Taylor\u2019s train of thought.However, Cale stopped clicking his tongue and stopped moving.The one that has a power that I am familiar with, I am hoping that you do not get this power.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u2018The one with a power I am familiar with?\u2019That phrase had caught Cale\u2019s attention. At the same time, the wind started to get stronger and swept through the area.Tang. Tang. Tang. The wind clashed even stronger against the transparent wind and made loud noises. However, Cale\u2019s concerned expression was not because of the wind. His hair continued to flutter in the wind.\u2018Is he talking about the Indestructible Shield?\u2019The only thing that Cale could deduce about this, \u2018familiar power,\u2019 was the Indestructible Shield. It had not said anything like that to Taylor in the novel. Did the owner of this ancient power know the owner of the Indestructible Shield? Multiple thoughts flew across Cale\u2019s mind at once.However, Cale still chose to step forward for now. The wind would only get stronger if he delayed any longer.I pretty much betrayed my comrades! I was a terrible person! Ahem, I stayed alive on my own and got old. How shameful am I?!Cale could only hear the old man\u2019s voice every so often as he was having difficulty stepping forward one step at a time.I was always hoping for everyone to come back to life. However, my wish was something that could not be achieved. I could only lament and cry! That was why I could not finish my rock tower.\u201cHow annoying.\u201dCale found the old man\u2019s lamenting voice to be annoying. Screw sincere, it was like he wanted to die. It was the style that Cale hated. Epicureans were so much better.Cale centered his body after being slightly pushed back, and put some strength into his legs. He could hear the voice once again after taking another step.This restoration strength is useless. It is only capable of protecting myself. It is not helpful in any other way. I am a trash!Cale ignored the cries of the old man that rang through his mind. The power to protect himself was most important to Cale. Who cares if it made him trash. None of it mattered as long as he could live.Just five more steps. The center of the tornado was right in front of him.Boom. Boom. Boom.The sound of the wind that was clashing became stronger. It was as if a human was punching the shield.\u2018It might break.\u2019Cale thought that the wind might now be strong enough for the shield to break. It should be doing more damage than just pushing him back now. The moment Cale thought that the wind might cut him, he realized something else as well.I did not die even when the wind cut me like a sharp blade.It was the fact that the owners of these ancient powers were all extremely chatty.Cale immediately curled up and decreased the size of the shield. Boom Boom. The shield was now smaller, but in return, it was much stronger. It was able to push back an even stronger force of wind.Cale reached out toward the transparent shield and clenched the transparent handle on the inside of the shield as he continued to move forward.One step.Restoration is a cursed power.Two steps.My heart was always beating. But I could not move on.Three steps.It was because I was afraid of death.Four steps.I was afraid of pain because I had always been injured, and I was even more afraid of death, the end of that pain.And finally.Cale took the final fifth step.Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-The inside of the windless area sounded like it was raining all around Cale. The eye of the storm. The winds were swarming the area outside this calm center. He could hear the old man\u2019s voice along with the sound of the wind.I chose to throw everything else away so that I could continue to live.That was the last thing the old man said.\u201cTsk.\u201d\u2018Who cares about anything else? Living comes first.\u2019This old man had a lot of useless things to say. Cale clicked his tongue and returned the shield back to his heart. The silver light surrounding him instantly disappeared.He headed toward the half completed rock tower and crouched down in front of it.It was a normal rock tower that you could find at the top of a mountain.However, all of these rocks were black. Just like the man-eating tree, these rocks that have existed since ancient times were different from normal rocks. Just like the wind surrounding this area.\u201cWhatever.\u201dCale, who had been thinking about making it aesthetically pleasing, changed his mind. That would be too annoying. He took out a pair of gloves from his pocket and put them on before picking the rocks up to stack the rest of the rock tower.Clack. Clack. Clack. The rock tower was being built up, one rock at a time.It did not take that long. Even Taylor had completed this part pretty easily. However, Cage, who had not come into the central area and had instead waited outside the eye of the storm, suffered quite a bit. This central area, like with all ancient powers, was somewhere that a person could only enter on their own.\u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201dCale picked up the last black rock and gently put it on top of the rock tower. It was at that moment.Flash!The black rocks slowly turned white. At the same time, Cale got up and looked around.The wind was slowly dying down.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dCale ignored the confused voice of the dragon and waited until all of the wind died down. He then crossed his arms and listened to the old man\u2019s voice. He had no choice.I tried to fight with them. However, I did not know that I was so weak against pain. They were not people who served the lord. I only realized that after we all went our separate ways and I ended up alone.The words of the old man caught Cale\u2019s attention. He then recalled the words of the owner of the Indestructible Shield.\u2018The people in the Forest of Darkness who called themselves servants of the lord only gave me terrible food.\u2019He had a bad feeling that he had learned something he shouldn\u2019t have learned about.He had an odd feeling that the things he just heard were things that he should not tell anybody else about in his entire life.Cale started to frown even more as the old man continued to speak. That voice was something only Cale could hear, thus making the dragon hesitate while looking at the silently standing Cale.I piled the rocks. I piled them up hoping that I could turn back time, hoping that I could be happy. But then I destroyed it.I hated my selfish self for thinking about my own happiness after betraying my comrades and running away.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale let out a long sigh. This old man really was frustrating. Cale started to speak in frustration.\u201cIt is human nature to be selfish.\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice disappeared for a moment.\u2018Is it over?\u2019Cale started to smile thinking that the old man was finally getting to the end. However, the sobbing voice continued once more.Ahem. My older sister said the same thing. She was a really wonderful older sister. She was more reliable than anybody else. Ah, my older sister. Sob!\u2026The old man was crying.\u201cI\u2019m going to go crazy.\u201dTap Tap. Tap. Cale was impatiently tapping the ground with his foot. Cale did not want to keep standing here like this. After crying for a while, the old man showed his thanks.You, the one with the familiar power. That rude personality of yours makes me think of my older brother. I am very envious of how rude you are.And, finally, the old man said the final words that Cale had been waiting for. These were the same final words the old man had said to Taylor.Break it. Then you will, \u2018overcome,\u2019 your limits.Cale started to smile and instantly kicked the rock tower without any hesitation.Tang. Crumble. Boom!The white rocks flew away to hit the ground and the wall. The dragon that had been watching Cale flinched and stared at Cale as if he was crazy. However, the following scene made the dragon gasp.\u201cWow.\u201dThe brocken rock tower.A white light floated up from underneath the rock tower.Ooooooooong.The gentle vibration that pulsated throughout the cave could be felt under Cale\u2019s feet. At that moment, the light rushed toward Cale.Cale reached his hand out to grab the light. The moment he grabbed it, the light shot toward Cale\u2019s heart like an arrow. The light arrow pierced through Cale\u2019s heart before flashing and disappearing.\u201cHuuuuu.\u201dCale let out a deep breath. He then lowered his head to look under his shirt. The fancy shield tattoo that was over his heart had disappeared and had been replaced by a red heart.Cale could immediately feel the new vigor inside of his body. This vigor from the, \u2018Vitality of the Heart,\u2019 would make the shield even stronger. He would also recover at a much faster speed than normal people, even when he got injured.Unlike the shield, which was a superpower, this was more apart of the physical strengths of the human body. This regenerative strength was so strong that it managed to last since the ancient times to be passed down like this.Cale brought forth the shield again.\u201cJust as I expected.\u201dCale started to smile. The pattern on the shield had changed to a heart. The only difference from the tattoo on his chest was that it was silver and not red. He then returned the shield, before immediately starting to walk.\u201cYou.\u201dCale had walked toward the dragon, that was pretending like nothing was going on and instead kept staring up at the sky. Cale just continued to stare at the dragon that was crouched down on the ground. He then stoically asked the dragon, as if he was throwing a rock into a lake.\u00a0[1]\u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026You are so weak that you need protection. But I do not like humans.\u201dThe dragon answered, that way before starting to turn invisible. It had used its invisibility magic again. Cale just snorted at the disappearing dragon.\u201cWhat a fickle punk.\u201dHe was also fickle for asking the question after telling the others to ignore the dragon, but this dragon was just as bad. However, he could not just ignore the dragon after it had jumped out earlier to try to save him.Cale looked around the cave, which no longer had any wind storms raging about, before turning around and heading out of the cave. Of course, he had to crawl back out as well. He returned the vines back to their original spots, and covered up the cave entrance properly.He then turned around and started to speak while walking away. His gaze was directed toward a grassy area.\u201cI can see you standing on the grass.\u201dHe could see four imprints on the grass, each one representing one of the dragon\u2019s four paws. These paw imprints then quickly disappeared. The dragon had flown up into the sky. Cale shook his head.\u2018I guess my family grew in the end.\u2019Cale could not help but let out a deep sigh. It was obvious that the dragon would continue to follow him in that invisible state. Just why was this dragon such a noob when it knows ancient magic like invisibility? Cale had thought that all dragons were intelligent, but that seemed like it might not be the case.After walking back down the mountain, Cale could see Choi Han\u2019s judging expression. Choi Han looked at Cale silently, before finally asking.\u201cDid you\u2026 roll around the mountain?\u201d\u2018Shit.\u2019The wind had made his hair a mess, and his clothes were dirty after crawling across the rocky and sandy cave entrance.Cale sternly responded to Choi Han.\u201cYes. I rolled around.\u201dChoi Han looked toward Cale with concern. Cale just avoided the gaze.That night, Cale told the kittens to deliver a message. It was a letter that was created with magic, which made it impossible to determine the handwriting of the writer.\u201cMake sure they don\u2019t see you.\u201dThe letter was the new hope for the priestess Cage and the Marquis\u2019s eldest son, Taylor.1. Something similar to the English proverb of trying to break a boulder with an egg.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only light in the area was the light on the first floor of this small house, shining out through the windows. Marquis Stan\u2019s eldest son, Taylor, the owner of the house, started to frown.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\u201cDamn it. Ugh. Hold on. Don\u2019t talk to me right now.\u201dCage, the priestess of the God of Death, was clenching her head in pain.Clang.The beer cup in her hand fell to the ground. Taylor and three of his people approached her quickly.\u201cWhat? Is the lord saying something to you again?\u201dTaylor looked toward her with concern. The God of Death spoke to Cage from time to time. This had suddenly happened one day and would sporadically appear like this. Cage had hidden this fact from the church, and only Taylor and his three subordinates knew about it.\u201cAh, so annoying!\u201dAfter struggling for a while, Cage jumped up and headed to the back door of the house. She was moving pretty quickly. She was still clenching her head and staggering a bit, but her gaze remained focused on the back door.Taylor told his subordinates to stay back as he pushed his wheelchair and followed behind her.\u2018Did someone break in?\u2019They may be in a small house, but there were magic alarms set up everywhere. Taylor was too paranoid about his younger brother to sleep without these alarms.After having both of his knees destroyed by a hitman in his own room at the Marquis\u2019s estate, there was nowhere that Taylor considered to be safe anymore.\u201cCage. What is going on?\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201dSlam!Cage slammed the back door open. Taylor could only see a peaceful backyard. It was calm and tranquil, as always. There were a couple of lamps lighting the garden up, making it the most lit area in the property.Cage started to rush into the backyard and Taylor followed behind her. Cage walked all the way to the fence at the boundary of the property and let out a gasp.\u201cHa!\u201dThis was the location right outside of the range of the alarm. On top of that fence was a small rock tower made of five small rocks.It was just large enough for the single knight staying at this house to find when he went on his patrol later.\u201c\u2026 Crazy shit. It was real.\u201dSome rough words came out of Cage\u2019s mouth. Taylor arrived next to Cage in his wheelchair and started to look at the rock tower on top of the fence with confusion.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dAt Taylor\u2019s question, Cage read the message that was written in chalk next to it.\u201c\u2018Break this if you want your wish to be granted.\u2019 That\u2019s what it says.\u201dConfusion and curiosity both filled Taylor\u2019s face simultaneously. Cage let out a sigh after looking at him and pressed her temples with her finger.\u201cI vote that you break it. No, it sounds crazy, but the lord says to break it.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThis is the first time the lord has not said some bullshit. Why is he talking so much these days? He usually speaks to me maybe once a year.\u201d\u201cWhat does this rock tower have to do with it?\u201dCage turned to make eye contact with Taylor.\u201cThe turning point of our lives. That is what he said.\u201dThe God of Death only came to Cage when she was sleeping. Sleep was similar to death. That was why sleep was a path of sorts for the God of Death. However, this time, she had heard her lord while she was drinking.Cage thought that the God of Death was angry at her for drinking too much beer. That was why she had welcomed it. She wanted this god to stop paying attention to her. However, the God of Death had a different message for her.\u201c\u2018The decision is yours to make. However, don\u2019t break it if you want to live a peaceful life.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said.\u201dShe looked toward the rock tower. There was something underneath.\u201cThere is a letter underneath the rock tower. I think they piled this rock tower up for the letter.\u201dShe turned back to look her her best friend, Taylor. He had to look up from the wheelchair, so, although he could see the rock tower, he could not see the letter underneath it.\u201cI don\u2019t feel any strange powers surrounding the rock tower.\u201dAlthough she was not as sensitive as real mages, using divine powers allowed Cage to be pretty sensitive and perceptive toward her surroundings. She would be able to feel if there were any curses or negative energy surrounding an item or a place. She was, after all, a servant of the God of Death.She was waiting for Taylor\u2019s response.Taylor looked up at the night sky, before slowly turning to look at Cage.\u201cDestroy it.\u201dCage immediately punched the rock tower in of her.Tang. Tang. Tang.The rocks on top of the fence all fell down. Taylor just blankly watched it happen.\u2018Don\u2019t break it if I want to live peacefully?\u2019Taylor had never lived peacefully. He also had no desire to live peacefully. He was going to find a way to get his legs fixed and continue to push forward. And then-\u2018I will overturn this damned family of mine.\u2019Taylor reached his hand out and Cage handed him the envelope. Taylor immediately opened the envelope and found that letter was written using magic to prevent people from recognizing the sender\u2019s handwriting. Nobles frequently used this item.Taylor opened the letter without any hesitation. The first two lines of the letter, that were visible through the lamps in the yard, immediately caught his attention.[The crown prince is in possession of an ancient power. It is called the \u2018Star of Healing,\u2019 and is useless to him. It is a one-time use power that can heal any type of injury.][He is looking to trade it for a method to hold the second prince and third prince in check.]Taylor\u2019s hands started to shake.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dCage stiffened up after seeing Taylor\u2019s expression and his shaking hands. However, she soon relaxed.\u201cHa!\u201dIt was because Taylor started to laugh. He then handed her the letter.\u201cit will definitely be a turning point in our lives.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201dCage took the letter from Taylor and started to read. She stopped for a moment after reading about the ancient power and the crown Prince, but then continued to read the rest. She then jerked her head up after reading the bottom part of the letter.[Your legs might not move, but your head, arms, eyes, and mouth can. The rest of you is still very much alive.][The decision is yours to make, Taylor Stan, eldest son of Marquis Stan.]Taylor looked toward the darkness at the corner of the yard and started to speak.\u201cCage.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cLet's leave this place to the butler, and head to the capital for now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe decided to go along with the decision of the still alive Taylor. She was someone who had experienced death many more times than anybody else because she was a priestess of the God of Death, thus causing her to be very clear about the value of life.\u201cI\u2019m sure the intelligent Taylor will take care of everything. You\u2019re pretty good at that.\u201dCage was trusting Taylor\u2019s mind and abilities.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I used to be pretty good.\u201d\u2018Used to be.\u2019 Cage gazed toward Taylor after hearing him use past tense.\u201cI should have known how to take care of myself.\u201dUnfortunately, Taylor injured his legs because he did not take good care of himself by letting himself get caught off guard.Taylor lifted his head to look at the small two story house. He had been frustrated enough being here for the last few months following a lead he didn\u2019t even know was real or not. Rather than just continuing this futile effort, it might be better to leave for a bit.At least the God of Death did not lie. Taylor was in need of a turning point. He started to speak.\u201cIf it is the Crown Prince, we need to match the timing for the royal event. We need to hurry.\u201d\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d\u201cWill it be okay? We will run into a lot of the people from the temple if we go to the capital.\u201d\u201cWhat can they do? Excommunicate me? That\u2019d be great. I\u2019m just worried about you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dThey smiled at each other and spoke at the same time, as Cage lifted up the letter.\u201cBenefactor.\u201dWell, they couldn\u2019t be sure if this person was their benefactor or not, but they both had a feeling that the writer of this letter was their benefactor. That meant that, eventually, they would need to find this benefactor and return the favor.Two pairs of eyes, that were clear and without any traces of drinking just a few moments ago, quietly looked at the letter. It was the gaze of people who had found their turning point.The red kitten that was watching all of this from the roof of another house whispered to his sister, On.\u201cNoona, we can go home now, right?\u201d\u201cYes. We did our job. Let\u2019s go eat meat.\u201d\u201cWoohoo!\u201dThe two kittens jumped from roof to roof as they returned to the residence.The next day, Cale was standing with his arms crossed and a frown on his face. His gaze was looking up and down at the person in front of him.Cale\u2019s outfit was even more flashy and luxurious than usual.\u2018Young master! Even if I, Hans, was not there, how could you go rolling around on the mountain?\u2019\u2018This Vice Captain should have escorted you!\u2019\u2018Aigoo, young master. This Ron is very sad.\u2019Cale had dressed up because he was annoyed at the gazes he got after coming back looking like a mess from crawling through the cave. The fancy outfit he was wearing looked quite good with his bright red hair. Cale was definitely not lacking when it came to looks.But there was another reason Cale was looking annoyed right now.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go like that?\u201dThey were standing in front of the inn. Cale was standing there with his arms crossed and looking at Choi Han. Choi Han had a small bag and his sword with him.\u201cYes.\u201dThere was no special feast or farewell party for the leaving Choi Han. Neither Cale nor Choi Han wanted something like that.That was why this farewell was pretty small as well.Cale, the kittens, Hans, Ron, Beacrox, and the Vice Captain. That was it. The fact that the Vice Captain was there was a bit odd, but he was standing there with a frown like Cale as he said his goodbye.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale sighed before taking a small bag out of his pocket and throwing it toward Choi Han. Choi Han easily caught the bag. Choi Han recognized the bag. It was the same size as the bag that Cale had given to the Black Dragon. Choi Han opened the bag to find potions and other types of useful items inside. Choi Han lifted his head from the bag and looked toward Cale. Cale just bluntly spoke when they made eye contact.\u201cWhat? What do you want? Just chuck it away if you don\u2019t want it.\u201dChoi Han did not say anything, but Cale was just saying whatever he wanted to do. He then turned around and headed toward his room.\u201cGoodbye.\u201dCale had a stoic expression as he turned around after saying goodbye. There should not be any more reasons to see Choi Han. Well, that is, after one more time. They will meet again once at the capital, before he sends Choi Han off with Ron and Beacrox, along with a few orders. After that, he planned on having no contact with Choi Han at all.\u201cI will be back soon.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s response, that seemed to contain a bit of joy, gave Cale the chills, but he did not look back. Choi Han felt that it was very much like Cale not to look back. His gaze then turned toward the rest of the group.\u201cSee you at the capital!\u201d\u201cAhem. I will be training myself so that I will be the young master\u2019s personal guard when we are at the capital.\u201dDeputy butler Hans cheerfully said goodbye, while the Vice Captain responded in a very annoyed voice.\u201cI will keep my blade sharpened.\u201d\u201cSee you later.\u201dBeacrox and Ron said goodbye as well. Of course, the kittens patted Choi Han\u2019s leg with their paws to say goodbye.Finally, the Black Dragon, that had been using invisibility magic to stay in the yard during the day and lay by Cale\u2019s window at night, sent some invisible mana to Choi Han.\u201cI\u2019ve already received so much, but I seem to keep being on the receiving end.\u201dChoi Han put the magic bag in his pocket before starting to smile. Cale could not see it because his back was turned, but this was the first time the rest of them saw Choi Han with such a bright smile.\u201cI will see you all at the capital.\u201dChoi Han respectfully said goodbye before heading out of the inn. Someone like him, who had spent tens of years in solitude that felt even worse than death, now had somewhere to return to. He also had people he needed to pay back for their grace.\u2018I need to make sure to properly complete this task.\u2019Choi Han walked away from Cale and the rest, and headed out of Puzzle City.The next morning, Cale\u2019s group got on the carriage and prepared to leave Puzzle City as well.\u201cYoung master, we are ready to go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCale nodded his head at Ron\u2019s words, and Ron quickly closed the window and got the carriage to start moving. They were starting back on their journey.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dCale was staring at the kitten siblings, who were fidgeting while trying to avoid his gaze. The kittens flinched and turned their eyes away. Cale started to smile.\u201cWhat? Did you meet a dragon or something?\u201dGasp. Cale heard the kittens gasp, but just ignored it. Choi Han may have left, but now a dragon was following them. However, he did not have time to worry about that fact.After a day\u2019s worth of travel, they were now getting ready to make camp.\u201cExcuse me, if it is okay, may we share a part of your campsite?\u201dA carriage arrived by Cale\u2019s campsite area, and the person that seemed to be the driver got off and approached the Vice Captain.\u201cMay I ask who you are?\u201dThe Vice Captain asked, even though he already knew the answer after seeing the red snake on the driver\u2019s armor. The driver bowed to the Vice Captain and Cale behind him and introduced himself.\u201cMy name is Tom, and I am a part of Marquis Stan\u2019s estate.\u201d\u2018Shit.\u2019Cale almost said that out loud, as he looked at the shabby looking carriage without a crest. The window opened and Cale could see the face of Taylor Stan.\u201cMy name is Taylor Stan. I saw Count Henituse\u2019s crest, and am asking for help, even though I\u2019m sure it is not ideal.\u201dIf it is the strong Count Henituse\u2019s campsite, Taylor thought he would be safe for the night. It was not so good in Cale\u2019s eyes.Cale had now met Marquis Stan\u2019s eldest son Taylor and the crazy priestess Cage. He thought about the dragon that would be hunting a boar or deer for him right now and started to frown.\u2018Damn it.\u2019One left and three showed up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One was a dumb dragon, another was a crazy priestess who wants to be excommunicated, and the third was a punk from Marquis Stan\u2019s family.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale could not help but sigh. He dropped his head before lifting it back up again. Once he did, he could see that it had become much quieter. Cale thought the silence was odd, and looked toward Hans.Hans smiled awkwardly, before stealthily gesturing toward the driver, Tom, and Taylor, who was looking out of the carriage window.Taylor had a bitter smile on his face as he started to speak.\u201cIf it is inconvenient for your party, we will leave.\u201dThe eldest son of the Marquis family, and the son who was pushed out of the family. After his legs became paralyzed, Taylor\u2019s life turned 180 degrees overnight, from one of luxury and power, to one where his family gave him just the minimal amount of support needed to survive.Those nobles, who knew that anyone other than the successor to the Marquis title in the Stan family would die immediately, started to avoid Taylor, finding him to be an annoyance. They even purposefully ignored him in front of Venion or the other siblings to try to curry their favor as well. The current Taylor\u2019s situation was even worse than that of a bastard son of a baron\u2019s family.Taylor knew about Cale, the trash of the Henituse family. A luxurious golden turtle as their symbol, as well as being a handsome young man with red hair. There was no one other than Cale who fit that description. Even someone like Count Henituse, who did not join a faction, could find it uncomfortable to associate with someone like him. They were all like that after his body became paralyzed.Taylor had remembered the reality of the situation after hearing Cale\u2019s sigh. But at that moment.\u201cWhy would you leave?\u201dCale walked toward Taylor\u2019s carriage with a stoic expression on his face.\u201cThis isn\u2019t my property. I wouldn\u2019t do something so childish when we are both fellow travelers.\u201dCale and Taylor made eye contact with each other. Cale then quickly peeked inside Taylor\u2019s carriage.\u2018She is there.\u2019The crazy priestess, Cage, was observing him from inside the carriage. Cale had read about how her curses were really scary. Some people even said her curses were at the level of a necromancer, the cursed profession.Cale turned his gaze away from Cage and reached his hand out.\u201cI am Cale Henituse of the Henituse family.\u201dTaylor gazed at the hand reaching out to him from outside the carriage. He then looked back at Cale\u2019s stoic expression.Click.Taylor opened the carriage door. Proper etiquette indicated that he should step out of the carriage to return the greeting.\u201cIt is difficult for me to step out because of my legs.\u201d\u201cI am aware.\u201dTaylor looked once more toward Cale, who did not seem to care about the proper etiquette, and shook his hand. It was just a short handshake.\u201cNice to meet you, young master Cale.\u201d\u2018Not at all.\u2019Cale was not happy about this meeting at all. He quickly tried to turn around because he did not want to be introduced to Cage. Unfortunately, Taylor was an extremely respectful person.\u201cThis is my companion, priestess Cage-nim. She is a follower of the God of Eternal Rest.\u201dEternal rest. This was a term for death. Cale held back another sigh, and looked toward Cage. Cage gracefully greeted him like a proper priestess.\u201cNice to meet you, young master Cale. My name is Cage. May the peace of the night always be with you.\u201d\u2018Peace of the night.\u2019 That was the general greeting those who served the God of Death gave to the public.\u2018Peace of the night my ass.\u2019Forget peace of the night, Cale felt like he wouldn't be able to even sleep properly tonight. He felt like he was drinking lemonade as he looked toward Cage, who was gently smiling.\u2018She\u2019s acting all nice and innocent, even though she finds that to be so annoying. That is the number one reason she wants to be excommunicated.\u2019She really was good at acting. Cale smiled at Cage, who still had a very stereotypical smile of a priestess on her face, and confidently replied.\u201cI do not believe in a god.\u201dCage\u2019s gaze became curious. Her gaze seemed to be asking what kind of crazy thing Cale was saying to a priestess, but Cale welcomed it. Cale just wanted her to keep thinking that he was a trash.\u201cYou are an interesting person.\u201d\u201cI guess I am a bit interesting.\u201dCale just casually responded to her statement and looked around the carriage. It was extremely shabby for the eldest son of a Marquis. Just one knight, a subordinate, who also served as the driver, and the two of them, Cage and Taylor.\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s out of money as well.\u2019Taylor probably spent a lot of money putting magic tools around the Puzzle City residence.Since he was not getting much help from the Marquis, he wouldn\u2019t really have any emergency funds to use. Taylor was probably doing everything he could to reduce his expenses.Taylor closed his eyes to hold back the shame while watching Cale look through his carriage. Cale did not put much meaning behind it, and started to think.\u2018They are probably heading to the capital because of my message.\u2019It was obvious where they were heading. It was to the capital, to meet the crown prince.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dCale vaguely gave an order to the approaching Hans.\u201cHelp them out.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cSet up a separate meal for them and set up a campsite next to our as well.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to eat with them, or even share the same campsite.\u201cAnd don\u2019t look for me. You take care of everything.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to create a situation for them to come into contact with one another. Of course, he felt like things would not go as he wanted.\u201cYes, sir. I will serve them like I am serving you, young master.\u201d\u201cWhatever. Go bring me some alcohol.\u201d\u2018Why did he suddenly become so passionate?\u2019Cale just stared at the suddenly passionate Hans, and slightly bowed toward Taylor as he said goodbye.\u201cThen I will be on my way, young master Taylor.\u201d\u201cThank you for your benevolence, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing.\u201dCale turned away from Taylor, who had a curious look on his face. He then immediately headed back to his carriage without looking anywhere else. Of course, he gave an order to the Vice Captain who was walking by his side.\u201cLooks like they only have one knight. Vice Captain, you take care of their guard duty as well.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dCale verified what the Vice Captain had said to Taylor\u2019s knight before getting back on the carriage. It was regarding guard duty at night. Cale verified the knight\u2019s expression turning bright before the knight got back onto the carriage.Click.The door closed with a loud click. This made everyone turn their gaze toward the closed door of the carriage with the golden turtle crest, before returning to do their duties. Only Taylor and Cage, who didn't really have anything to do right now, just continued to stare at the closed door.The two kittens greeted Cale inside the carriage.\u201cI\u2019ve seen those two people.\u201d\u201cHong. I was there too.\u201dThe kittens, who had been watching everything through the window, slowly approached Cale and sat down next to him before starting to talk to each other. They weren\u2019t looking at Cale nor even talking to him, but it was clear that the question was toward Cale.Cale answered the witty kittens\u2019 question.\u201cPretend not to know.\u201d\u201cLike the dragon?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe kittens nodded their heads to show their understanding. Cale watched them nod, before crossing his arms and closing his eyes.\u2018The Healing Star.\u2019That was the name of the ancient power he wrote about in the letter to Cage and Taylor. The reason Cale came to know about this power was because of the Plaza Terror incident.\u2018The Healing Star,\u2019 is a single use power that can heal any injury or illness to the body\u2019s original, healthy state. The crown prince was in possession of such a power. The deceased queen had given it to him.During the Plaza Terror incident, the secret organization makes their move once the royal family arrives. Magic bombs across the capital and in the plaza go off at that moment at the same time.In the novel, Choi Han was only able to stop about half of it. That in itself was amazing, such that the kingdom considered him a hero, but Choi Han himself thought about the lives of the victims of the bombs, making his hatred for the secret organization become even worse.\u2018At that time, the secret organization installed bombs on some people during the incident.\u2019Choi Han, along with the genius mage Rosalyn, protected the people from the bombs and helped with their escape. At that time, there was an old man that Choi Han had failed to save.The man had lost his right arm and leg while taking a bomb off and throwing it away from himself, and this incident had made Choi Han extremely upset. Watching the old man\u2019s hurt body, the crown prince thought about, \u2018The Healing Star.\u2019 That was how the power was originally introduced in the novel.Naturally, the crown prince did not use the power on the old man. Instead, he consoled Choi Han, who was feeling responsible for the old man\u2019s death, and raised him up as a hero.\u2018It is only normal.\u2019Cale did not think the crown prince made the wrong decision. Who can judge him for wanting to use his power for himself? Of course, Choi Han or Rosalyn would have used it for the old man.\u201cBy the way, is little brother dragon still following us?\u201dCale nodded his head at Hong\u2019s question.\u2018Since it is like this, I might as well use the dragon for my benefit as well.\u2019His original plan was to save him and then be done with him, but if the dragon was going to follow him around the country like a little puppy, he might as well put it to good use. He had already thought about how to use that dragon the last few nights as well.Cale knew the location of the 5 magic bombs that Choi Han had found in the novel, but he was not sure about the location of the remaining 5 magic bombs that ended up going off.The five bombs that were located were found by using Rosalyn\u2019s genius-level mana detection abilities to find them one by one.But now, Cale had an existence that was worlds better than Rosalyn at detecting mana following him around like a lost duck.\u201cMight as well make it work hard.\u201dThe kittens flinched at that statement, but Cale did not see it as he was thinking about all of the work he was going to make the dragon do in the capital. The dragon, who had no idea about any of this, delivered a boar to the campsite early in the morning once again.Cale, who slept in after staying up late planning out the things that needed to be completed at the capital, went out to verify the boar before noticing an odd atmosphere.He had eaten and slept in the carriage last night. He was doing his best to not interact with Taylor and crew. That was why he could not understand this odd, and somewhat, dark atmosphere.\u201cHans. What is going on?\u201dHans put on an awkward smile and greeted Cale. Hans, as well as the rest of the Cale\u2019s group, were quickly getting past their suspicions about the meat and fruit being delivered to them.Although Cale had no idea what Ron thought about it, since Cale and Choi Han both had said that it was fine, they just went along with it. Beacrox was easy to convince since he was always excited to see ingredients of the highest quality appear every morning.\u201cHaha, young master, did you finally wake up?\u201dHans slowly peeked toward Taylor and Cage, before approaching Cale.\u201cYou see, I think young master Taylor has gotten the wrong idea.\u201d\u201cWrong idea?\u201dCale could see the boar, as well as Taylor on the wheelchair, and Cage pushing Taylor\u2019s wheelchair behind him. He approached the dead boar and stood next to the wheelchair as he started to speak.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dAs usual, the boar that the dragon delivered was enormous. It was larger than a tiger, the type of boar that would excite Beacrox quite a bit.And, as usual, there was a drawing next to the boar. The dragon must have found it annoying to draw the fork, as only the knife was drawn this time.\u201c\u2026Young master Cale. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhat kind of utter nonsense was this?Taylor had an apologetic smile on his face as he turned away from the boar.\u201cIt seems like my movements have been detected.\u201dMovement? Cale could then hear the priestess Cage mumbling behind Taylor. She was angry.\u201cWe left in secret, so how is it possible? There is someone who can avoid my detection? This is too much!\u201d\u2018How would someone at your level detect a dragon?\u2019Cale was done figuring out what was going on.Something, or someone, that was able to catch such a large boar so easily and drop it off at their campsite without being detected by the priestess Cage or anyone else. That strength and stealthiness was something only an expert would have. Next to that feat of strength was a drawing of a knife.It was a small knife to Cale, but they seemed to be seeing a very large knife. Cale looked back at Taylor, who was looking at him with both despair and sorriness.\u201c\u2026Young master Cale. This incident - \u201c\u201cBeacrox.\u201dCale called out to Beacrox.Marquis Stan\u2019s second son, Venion, was probably extremely busy right now. Why would someone like that pay attention to the disabled eldest son? It wasn\u2019t like Venion knew, \u2018The Healing Star,\u2019 was at the capital.\u201cYes, young master?\u201dBeacrox, who was standing there with his kitchen knife prepared, responded with excitement on his face.\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be eating steak for breakfast.\u201d\u201cYoung master, it looks like we will get the highest quality steak once again.\u201dTaylor, who was staring at Cale with a blank expression, suddenly started to speak.\u201c\u2026 Once again?\u201dCale nodded his head and responded.\u201cWe have someone in our party who delivers food for us.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who is it?\u201dCale snorted before responding.\u201cHe is surprisingly shy so you will not be able to see him.\u201dCale saw the leaves on a tree not far from the campsite moving up and down and shook his head. Cale shaking his head made both Taylor and Cage turn red from embarrassment.\u201cAhem, I, I see. It seems we had the wrong idea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Beacrox is an excellent cook, so please have some steak before you go.\u201dBeacrox stopped caressing the boar and looked up at Cale. Cale could not look at Beacrox because of what Taylor said next.\u201cYoung master Cale, I heard that you are heading for the capital. If it is okay with you, may we follow behind you?\u201d\u2018I knew it would be like this.\u2019It was as Cale had expected.\u201cPlease feel free to do whatever is best for you.\u201dThere was no way they would find out that he had written the letter just from them traveling with him. If it was going to be like this anyways, he might as well take care of them until the capital and have them owe him a debt.These two could be very useful in the future if he used them properly.\u201cThank you. We will be under your care until we get close to the capital.\u201dCale started to smile a bit at Taylor\u2019s words.\u2018At least he\u2019s not completely unreasonable.\u2019Close to the capital. Taylor was only asking for help until a location that would not make things difficult for Cale or Count Henituse in dealing with Venion or Marquis Stan for associating with the disabled Taylor. There would be all sorts of complications if they went into the capital together.\u201cWe will determine that later on.\u201dNaturally, Cale had a different opinion. There were still many items in the magic box waiting to be used by Cale.\u201cOf course. Please feel free to let us know whenever is most convenient for you, young master.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dTaylor and Cage looked toward the casually responding Cale with curiosity. However, Cale avoided their gaze and started to speak to Hans.\u201cBring my meal to the carriage.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dCale headed back to the carriage. At that moment, someone called out to him.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dIt was Cage. She seemed to have a headache, as she started to frown and walk over toward Cale. Cale had a bitter taste in his mouth while watching Cage approach him.\u201cWhat can I do for you, priestess-nim?\u201d\u201cDo you really not believe in any god?\u201d\u2018Now what the heck does she want?\u2019\u201cYes, none of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dCale quickly headed to the carriage after hearing Cage\u2019s response. Taylor approached her as she watched Cale walk away.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dCage rarely engaged with people other than people from the temple or her close friends. That was why it was really odd for Taylor to see Cage frowning and reaching out to Cale. She shook her head and responded with a very bitter expression.\u201cIt\u2019s odd.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s like.\u201dCage touched the back of her head.\u201cI have this bitter feeling that the God of Death is caressing the back of my head with a sympathetic expression.\u201d\u201c\u2026What kind of feeling is that? Did you not sleep properly?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dCage continued to feel that way every time she looked at Cale. The only time she felt this way in the past was when the temple had forced her to do a lot of manual labor in order to build a new temple. She had felt this same feeling when she plopped down from exhaustion and the God of Death was looking down at her with concern.\u2018There\u2019s no way young master Cale will order us around like that damn temple.\u2019Cage decided Taylor was right about her not sleeping properly, and tried to shake the feeling away.That was how Cale\u2019s crew grew bigger and they continued toward the capital with no other issues.Every time Cale got tired of sitting down and stepped out of the carriage, Taylor\u2019s group continued to look toward him, but they did not have any conversations.They continued to travel like that until they were at an inn about one day\u2019s worth of travelling away from the capital.\u201cYoung master Cale, you like alcohol, right?\u201dTaylor and Cage came to look for Cale.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201dCale wanted to know why they came to visit him so late at night, but his expression was not that odd. Taylor smiled at Cale\u2019s demeanor.\u201cCale Henituse, the trash who cannot go a day without alcohol.\u201dWhen Taylor was still the potential successor to the Marquis, he had received all of the information about the nobles as well. Cale\u2019s information was so unique that there was no way he could forget it.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think that is all.\u201dHowever, Cale was very different compared to the information.He stayed in the carriage all day so that they would feel at peace, and had the generosity to give them the best treatment possible. His subordinates also trusted and followed him.Most importantly, he treated the two of them like normal people.\u201cYou are different from the rumors.\u201dThey were now right in front of the capital. Taylor and Cage would need to move stealthily starting early the next morning. Of course, they will have to confidently walk in when they walk into the royal palace.But there were many things they were prepared to research before that happened. However, they had made up their mind to move differently than their original plan.They had been watching Cale Henituse for over a week. This person was now on Taylor and Cage\u2019s mind.\u201cYoung master Cale. It should be okay to share a drink with us before we leave, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once all three of them sat down at the table, Cale did not even take a look at the alcohol before he asked.\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201dCale\u2019s voice was extremely cold and stoic as usual. However, this just confirmed in Taylor\u2019s mind that this person in front of him was not a trash. In fact, he was smarter than most people thought.Taylor had not come here just to drink with Cale. Alcohol was only good when you were comfortably drinking with people you could trust. Drinking with others was just for easy conversation and observing the other party.\u201cWhat kind of person do you think I am, young master Cale?\u201dCale quietly observed Taylor after hearing his question, before approaching his bed and picking up a pouch. He brought it back and put it on top of the table.Clang.A metallic sound filled the room as the pouch slightly opened. Inside the pouch were plenty of gold, silver, and bronze coins. Cale\u2019s confident voice filled the room.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are heading to the capital right now, when every noble in the country\u2019s attention is focused on the capital, but I\u2019m sure there is only one thing people like you who are heading into the lion\u2019s den want from me.\u201dCale had expected it from the moment they asked to follow him to the capital, as well as every time he felt their gazes during the trip.\u201cThe wealthy Henituse family. You want money, right?\u201dSigh.The priestess Cage let out a sigh that was almost like a gasp of admiration. Taylor was someone who used to play at the top before falling off a cliff, but Cage was someone who had always been at the bottom. To someone like her, Cale was an unique individual.He asked the deputy butler for alcohol whenever he had a free moment.He did not care at all about what his subordinates did, and only ate the highest quality food.He only stayed in the most luxurious inns, and always seemed to be relaxed. He also did not care about what he said to others.However, he was definitely not trash.Her friend Taylor understood this even better than she did.\u201cSo you already knew.\u201d\u201cIt was a piece of cake.\u201dCale answered as if it was not difficult to deduce at all.\u201cBased on how you are traveling, you look like you are lacking in money. In order to stay at the capital, especially stealthily, you need money more than anything else. I\u2019m sure this was not originally your plan, but it was only natural to ask when you have the golden turtle traveling with you.\u201dTaylor could not disagree with anything Cale just said. It was the truth. Cale Henituse was someone who did not try to avoid him, the eldest son who was pushed aside by his family. Asking Cale and hopefully getting some money was their best course of action.Even if Cale said no, it didn\u2019t look like Cale would tell Venion about Taylor\u2019s request. Cale seemed to hate complicated things.In Taylor\u2019s eyes, Cale was someone who voluntarily hid from others.\u201cThank you very much, young master Cale.\u201dCale did not say anything like, \u2018you\u2019re welcome.\u2019 Instead, he was ready to put into play his plan that he had formulated and thought over ever since they started following him.\u201cWill you be leaving early in the morning?\u201d\u201cYes. We were planning on stealthily leaving, but came here to see you before we left. We need to take care of things on our own now.\u201dTaylor\u2019s eyes were clear as he sat on the wheelchair. However, Cale could not see any positive feelings in Taylor\u2019s eyes when he made eye contact.\u201cWill you be entering through the temple?\u201dThe moment Taylor\u2019s expression seemed to show shock at how Cale knew, Cage stepped in.\u201cYes. We plan to enter through the temple.\u201dThey were planning to disguise Taylor as a member of the temple and sneak him in. However, doing so would alert the Temple of Death of Cage\u2019s location. Cage was willing to put herself in that kind of danger for Taylor.However, even entering like that would not guarantee stealth. Cale poked at that problem.\u201cEven if you enter through the temple, Venion or the Marquis will hear about it within three days. They most likely have informants in the Temple of Death as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really are very well informed.\u201dCage started to smile. There was something she suddenly realized about Cale.\u201cYoung master Cale, I\u2019m sure there is a reason you are so curious about our course of action?\u201dTap. Tap.Cale\u2019s index finger tapped on the table.\u201cTake this money and let the innkeeper know that you and your people will be staying one more day here.\u201dCale then lifted up his finger and pointed toward the two of them.\u201cAs for the two of you, you will get on my carriage. The rest of your group will enter the capital one day later.\u201dScreech.Cale pushed the chair back and stood up. He then went over and grabbed another item from the magic box, and put it on top of the table.\u201cThis is a magic tool that will make any lifeforms in a selected area turn invisible for five minutes.\u201dThis was the second item that needed to be rented under Billos\u2019s name.\u2018Young master, are you planning on stealing something?\u2019\u2018Steal? No, I plan to break something.\u2019\u2018\u2026Break something?\u2019He was planning on using this item during the Plaza Terror Incident, but he had a reason to use it in advance now. Cale was thankful that it was not a single use item.Silence filled the room once Cale stopped talking. Cage and Taylor looked back and forth between Cale and the item, and their lips opened and closed multiple times, but they could not say anything. They finally managed to ask after a while of silence.\u201cWhy-\u201dYoung master Taylor, who had been silent for a while now, slowly started to ask.\u201cWhy are you doing this for us? You have nothing to gain from it.\u201d\u2018Why? I have to help you out a bit since I caused it. It\u2019s not like it is going to harm me in any way.\u2019In addition, if Taylor manages to take over the Marquis position, Cale would not need to worry about Marquis Stan or Venion\u2019s greed once the war with the foreign nations starts. That would help the Henituse territory remain quiet and allow Cale to live peacefully.\u201cMust I answer?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to hear your reason.\u201dTaylor wanted to hear Cale\u2019s response. Cale stoically answered Taylor\u2019s question. The response was both brutal and cold.\u201cIt\u2019s because you are so pitiful. I want to know just what is making someone like you, a cripple who doesn\u2019t know when he will die, do all of this. For the eldest son of a Marquis to ask the trash of a Count\u2019s family for money, it is just so pitiful.\u201dTaylor\u2019s mouth slowly opened and closed, before he started to silently laugh. Taylor then patted his knees with his hands. He could not feel anything when he did that.However, Taylor's eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and the rest of him was still alive. Taylor started to smile brightly.\u201cThank you for your sympathy. I needed that kind of sympathy.\u201d\u201cHowever, there is one condition to all of this.\u201dCale did not pay any attention to Taylor\u2019s words of thanks.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cForget about everything.\u201dCale repeated himself once more, as he pushed the bag of money toward Taylor.\u201cForget about every single thing that has happened.\u201dCale was showing that he was willing to help them, but did not want to be involved with them any further. Cage stepped forward. This was the reason she had come with Taylor.\u201cYoung master Taylor and I will make a vow to the God of Death to not reveal anything. I\u2019m sure that you are aware that anyone who breaks a vow made to the God of Death will die?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. Please make your vow.\u201dCale started to smile at her words. A vow made to the God of Death. It was because Cale believed in this famous vow that he was willing to help them out.The priestess Cage could not help but laugh after seeing Cale smile about their decision to make a vow to the God of Death.\u201cI presume young master Cale will not be making a vow?\u201d\u201cCorrect. If things become complicated in the future because of this, I plan on revealing everything.\u201d\u201cTo Venion.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale confidently answered the question. Hearing Cale\u2019s answer actually made Taylor feel much more peaceful. Taylor liked the fact that Cale was honest and said that he planned to reveal everything if it inconvenienced Cale in any way in the future.\u201cCage. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dTaylor and Cage. The two of them were no longer speaking formally in front of Cale. It was their signal to each other that they will reveal almost everything to Cale.\u201cWe will start now.\u201dTonight was the night of the new moon. On these nights, when the moon was not visible, was when the strength of the God of Death was at its peak. Cage closed her eyes and gathered her hands together in front of her. It looked different than when people were praying. Her two palms were pointed toward Taylor and herself.Oooooong.A small vibration filled the air. At the same time, a black smoke started to come out of Cage\u2019s fingertips and surrounded the three of them.\u2018Is this holy power?\u2019Cale was filled with an odd sensation while feeling the power around him. It was definitely different from ancient powers, but it was still warm, even though it was black.\u201cI, Cage, a daughter of the eternal night, wishes to borrow the name of the night to make a vow alongside Taylor Stan. A vow is made with our lives, anyone who breaks this vow will descend into eternal darkness.\u201dCage opened her eyes and looked toward Cale and Taylor before continuing to speak.\u201cI, Cage, and Taylor Stan, vow to keep tonight\u2019s discussions a secret only to be shared with the witness, Cale Henituse. We will not discuss this with anyone else.\u201d\u201cWith anyone else.\u201dTaylor repeated the ending words. Cage closed her eyes after hearing Taylor\u2019s voice. The black smoke surrounded the three of them once again. And then,Ooooong.With another vibration, the smoke disappeared. The vow was finished.\u201cPretty simple.\u201dCale could feel an odd sensation in his hand while sharing his thoughts. It was similar to ancient powers. He could sense the things related to the vow.\u201cThe sensation you feel right now is the power of the vow. The moment we break the vow, young master Cale will be informed of our deaths as the witness.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCale easily accepted her explanation. He had no choice because of the sensation in his hand. He started to inspect the difference between the divine power and the ancient power inside of him.At that moment, Taylor put the bottle of alcohol he brought at the middle of the table.Tap.The bottle now sat at the middle of the table.\u201cYoung master Cale, will you have a drink?\u201d\u201cA drink?\u201dCale hid his desire for them to leave, and asked what they meant. Taylor nodded his head at Cale\u2019s question.\u201cYes. Alcohol. Alcohol is necessary on a good day.\u201dTaylor wanted to drink with Cale, someone he could not trust until recently. Cage seemed to have figured something out by his actions, and started to smile before putting her hand into the wide sleeves of her priestess outfit.\u201cTada!\u201dThree shot glasses came out of her sleeve.\u201cHo.\u201dCale looked at the shot glasses, the bottle of alcohol, and the priestess with disbelief. He could not believe that she carried shot glasses in her sleeves.\u201cPriestess-nim.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou are amazing.\u201dShe was a true alcoholic. Cale took a glass from her, and Taylor filled the glass. Once all three of their glasses were full, Cage asked Cale a question.\u201cYoung master Cale, is it not weird that a priestess is drinking?\u201dCale tilted his head to one side and asked.\u201cIs that any of my business?\u201dCale did not care whether she drank or not.\u201cWow. I really like you.\u201dCage shared her admiration while smacking her knee with her other hand. She then coyishly asked Cale.\u201cYoung master Cale, do you not have any desire to get to know an older sister with a great personality?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dCale sternly answered and Taylor quickly added on.\u201c\u2026What about an older brother with a great personality?\u201d\u201cEven less.\u201dCage and Taylor both started to laugh instead of being disappointed at Cale\u2019s answer. Cale could not tell what was funny about his response, but lifted up his glass and started to speak.\u201cCheers.\u201dClang. The three glasses clanged together. A night of a new moon. There was no moon in the sky, but this alcohol that was deeper than the moon, and created a thread connecting these three individuals.The next morning.\u201cYoung master, shall we head out?\u201dCale did not know whether Hans was slow or just found this to be funny. Deputy butler Hans had heard the situation from Cale and pretended to not see the two people in the corner of Cale\u2019s carriage, instead loudly asking Cale whether they should leave.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go.\u201dOf course, Cale casually gave the command to go.Two hours. They would arrive at the entrance of the capital in two hours.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Taylor was fine compared to the priestess, who was struggling with her hangover. In fact, he was even better off than Cale. This weak-looking noble had the strongest alcohol tolerance out of the three of them.Cale started to respond to Taylor, who was looking at him.\u201cThis is my first time going to the palace. I have only been to a Northeastern Nobles Meeting a few years ago.\u201dTaylor did not bring this up just to start a conversation. It was because he wanted to share a piece of information with Cale for his generosity.\u201cI see. The event this time is to celebrate the 50th birthday of his royal highness, our current King.It is an entertaining festival for the citizens.\u201dSeeing Cale speak as if it did not include himself, Taylor started to get curious.\u201cSounds like it is not a festival for young master Cale?\u201d\u2018How can it be a festival I\u2019d enjoy when my heart is going crazy thinking about the terror incident?\u2019Cale did not say that out loud. He was probably the only person who knew about the secret organization and the upcoming terror incident.Knowing about such a fact was bound to bring a heavy sense of responsibility and headache. Of course, there was a relationship between that sense of responsibility and the headache.\u2018I will prevent it, but I will step aside if it seems like I will get hurt or tired.\u2019That was Cale\u2019s point of view on the terror incident. Do just enough so that I will not be inconvenienced. However, someone like Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo, who had a fear of death, could not just pretend that he did not know anything.\u201cIt\u2019s not a festival for you either, young master Taylor.\u201dTaylor, as well as Cage, who had been frowning because of her hangover, started to smile after hearing Cale\u2019s words.\u201cI am considering it to be my last obstacle before I can celebrate.\u201dCompared to his gentle appearance, Taylor was a risk-taker. That was how he was able to be in front of Venion, even with his ethical personality, before he was attacked.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBe careful of his highness, the crown prince.\u201dTaylor gazed toward Cale and continued to speak.\u201cAlthough I may have been pushed aside, I still have ways of getting information in the Marquis\u2019s Estate. Although this 50-year birthday celebration for the king was planned from the beginning, the act of calling all of the nobles together was something that the crown prince suggested.\u201dTaylor knew some information about the crown prince.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I should describe the crown prince to you\u2026\u201dSeeing Taylor struggling, Cale casually answered.\u201cHe is someone with a glib tongue.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Err, I mean\u2026\u201dTaylor, who agreed with Cale, quickly turned pale and tried to take it back, but, in the end, was forced to admit that it was true.\u201cYes. You are right. You already know about it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it information anybody who is interested can find out?\u201d\u201cOf course. But this is the first time I\u2019ve heard anyone be so blunt about it like you, young master Cale.\u201dSeeing Taylor nodding his head, Cale started to think about the crown prince.The glib tongue of the crown prince.The crown prince was very good at giving compliments to people. He was also very good at praising these people in public for their deeds and giving them recognition.After that, he used these people.Of course, the people being used have no idea that they are being used. One of these victims in the novel was none other than Choi Han, the person the crown prince lifts up as his close friend and hero.For a commoner like Choi Han, he thought it was good that someone like the crown prince treated him so closely. However, for Cale, or Kim Rok Soo, who was reading the novel, the crown prince was the type of person he hated the most.\u2018The problem is, that the way he uses people for the right reasons.\u2019He did not use people for his own benefits or for power. He used these people for the kingdom, the citizens, and to make the nation greater.\u2018I guess it is too much to call it \u2018using\u2019 people.\u2019Rather than using, it was more like asking for their help. The crown prince did not order these people using his superiority, but instead he asked them on an equal level.He used that glib tongue of his to praise them a lot and then give a really sad reason that people could not turn down. Naturally, Choi Han was unable to say no. The cold, yet just as good-natured Rosalyn ended up agreeing to help out in the end as well.Of course, even such a person had a weakness.\u201cAnyways, young master Cale, his highness the crown prince, ahem, as you already know, it is tiring to get involved with such a person.\u201d\u201cYou do not have to worry. I plan on being as quiet as possible before returning home. I do not like being flashy.\u201dCale answered back like it was nothing. However, he then realized that silence had filled the room after he responded. The kittens, On and Hong, Cage, who was struggling with her hangover, and even Taylor, who had a gentle smile on his face. They were all staring at Cale.\u201c\u2026Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cMm. Will it really be possible to, no, nevermind.\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dBoth Cage and Taylor said no before looking away. The kittens just shook their heads. Cale started to frown and added on.\u201cEven if I do end up being dragged in, the thing that young master Taylor and priestess-nim are thinking about will not happen.\u201dTaylor and Cage could see that Cale was smiling. His smile was so devious that he looked like a villain. Cale smiled at the two of them before continuing on.\u201cI also have a very glib tongue.\u201dThe crown prince tended to stay away from people similar to himself. It was his wariness of others like him.If the crown prince was the type to praise people and use them for his needs, Cale just needed to act the same way.Seeing Cage look toward him with an expression that seemed to say she was feeling better, he looked right into her eyes. She then started to speak.\u201cI think this look suits you very well, young master Cale. You look very evil.\u201d\u201cIt is better than looking like a good person.\u201d\u2018I knew it.\u2019Cage nodded her head and seemed to confirm something, but Cale did not care. Instead, he pushed aside the curtain on the window and looked outside.They were pretty close to the gate of the capital now. The gate that Cale\u2019s carriage was heading toward was a different gate than the gate that the commoners used. He was heading toward the noble\u2019s entrance, which would allow him to get through it much faster.\u201cThe capital really is different.\u201dThat was what came out of Cale\u2019s mouth based on what Cale saw out through the window. Taylor seemed to understand why Cale felt that way, and nodded his head.\u201cRoan Kingdom is the kingdom of, \u2018Boulders.\u2019\u201dCale could see the large wall surrounding the capital. There were many different sculptures on the wall.The Roan Kingdom was kind of unique. Not only was it the Western Continent\u2019s greatest source of marble, but the Northwest and Western areas of Roan Kingdom contained a lot of granite. That was why it was called the Land of Boulders.If you traveled up north, the majority of the mountain peaks were made of granite. The Roan Kingdom had quite a lot of Rock Mountains.Taylor continued to speak, as if he suddenly remembered something.\u201cIf you look through the ancient stories, there are many, \u2018boulder,\u2019 related stories, even before the Roan Kingdom came into existence. One of them says that this land had a boulder-like guardian.\u201dThe Roan Kingdom was located on the Northeast of the Western Continent.\u201cIt was a guardian that could protect everything from any kind of attack. When darkness descended on the continent, this guardian was the one to stand in the front against it.\u201dThere were many different myths about the end of the ancient times. You would hear tons of different stories as you traveled around the continent.Some say that the end of the ancient times came when darkness descended and some heroes managed to defeat this darkness, others say it ended because people were jealous of each other\u2019s powers and fought for control. Finally, some even say that a god was so angry that it destroyed all living beings.The story that Taylor was discussing right now was one of those many myths.\u201cTaylor, you seem to like that story?\u201dTaylor nodded his head at Cage\u2019s question.\u201cYes. I do.\u201dCale turned to look at Taylor. Taylor had always had a fragile body, even before his legs became paralyzed. Taylor patted his knees and continued to speak.\u201cThe guardian is said to have stood firmly in place, like a boulder, even after everything in his body became broken. That was how he was able to protect the people and the land of this Northeastern area, that is covered in boulders.\u201dThere were a lot of different contents in the stories regarding the darkness that descended onto the continent.When the darkness appeared at the center of the continent, other myths discussed the tales of those heroes that fought against it. However, the main character in the one Taylor is talking about only focused on protecting.Taylor considered such an individual to be a hero.\u201cSuch an existence cannot survive in the present day. That is why I like this myth so much.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t seem to believe it?\u201dTaylor nodded his head at Cage\u2019s question.It is very rare to see someone injure himself so severely to protect something.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dCale nodded his head to agree with Taylor\u2019s statement. It was one thing to protect yourself, but this guardian protected others and this Northeastern land? Cale could not understand such logic.\u201cBut this is my first time hearing about this specific story.\u201dCale had read about all sorts of legends and myths regarding ancient powers while reading until volume 5 of, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 However, this was the first time he heard about the boulder guardian of Roan Kingdom.\u201cIt is probably because it is not that popular. I only found it while researching through ancient texts for information about ancient powers. I told Cage about it as well.\u201dCale nodded his head again, and lowered the curtains once more. He then took out a round pendant from his pocket and threw it toward Taylor.\u201cGet ready.\u201dTaylor and Cage both nodded their heads and held each other\u2019s hand with the pendant in the middle of both of their hands. The magic device started to operate. Cale let out a sigh and grabbed a bottle from a corner of the carriage.A moment later, the carriage stopped outside the noble\u2019s gate, and Cale could hear the Vice Captain\u2019s voice as well as someone else\u2019s voice.Knock knock knock.\u201cYoung master, the capital\u2019s guard wishes to verify the occupants.\u201dBang.Cale\u2019s foot kicked the carriage door open. He could see the Vice Captain\u2019s relaxed expression, as well as the anxious capital guard. Cale had a bottle in one hand and a glass full of alcohol in the other, and looked toward the capital guard.\u201cGo ahead.\u201dThe inside of the carriage was full of the smell of alcohol. Cale\u2019s extremely flushed face and this stench made it very clear that he had been drinking since last night.Although the festival was still a week away, many nobles had already passed through this entrance. Two of the capital guards looked inside the carriage every time to do a cursory look. However, the guard had never seen such a sight before. The Vice Captain smiled gently at the guard, and started to speak.\u201cOur young master cures his hangovers through drinking more alcohol. He is someone who has reached the apex of overcoming a hangover.\u201dCale looked at the anxious guard and the Vice Captain who was trying to praise him as best as possible, and started to think.\u2018Ah, this is tiring.\u2019That was why he said the following.\u201cCan\u2019t you hurry up?\u201dThe guard called over the other guard to look through the carriage, that was full of empty alcohol bottles, and gave the approval.\u201cEverything looks fine.\u201dThe Vice Captain slowly closed the door while the guard welcomed Cale.\u201cWelcome to the capital.\u201dCreeak. Click.The door closed completely and the carriage made its way through the gate.Cale pushed forward the full glass in his hand and started to speak.\u201cApparently, welcome to the capital.\u201dTaylor, who was no longer invisible, started to laugh as he handed Cale the pendant and received the glass.\u201cIt has been a while since I\u2019ve been welcomed.\u201dCale\u2019s group had arrived at the capital.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: You (4)Cale\u2019s carriage leisurely headed to the south of the capital. Huiss, the capital of the Roan Kingdom. People were clearly busy getting ready for the upcoming birthday celebration.Cale looked out through the slightly lifted curtain and started to think.\u2018Choi Han should arrive in about 3 days.\u2019Unless he moves like a crazy lunatic, Choi Han should arrive three days later. He will bring Rosalyn and Lock with him, and they will run into the secret organization while getting Lock, which will delay them even more.In the novel, Choi Han ran into Lock, the only survivor of the Blue Wolf Tribe and someone with the Wolf King\u2019s bloodline, before running into the secret organization once again. After that, Choi Han would run into the secret organization once more at the capital terror incident.Harris Village, Choi Han\u2019s first residence outside the Forest of Darkness. This secret organization was the one that had murdered everyone in the village. He had run into the organization twice, but he did not have much information on them.\u2018The assassins don\u2019t have stars on their clothes.\u2019Since assassination was the goal for both Harris Village and the Blue Wolf Tribe, the secret organization sent their assassin squad. The assassin squad only wears black clothes without the stars, just in case something goes wrong. They were people who chose to take their own lives if they were caught.But things will change starting at the capital.\u2018That blood-loving punk will show up.\u2019While preventing the terror incident with Rosalyn, Choi Han comes in contact with a leader of the secret organization. That leader and their subordinates all have the red star and five white stars on their chest.Cale had already come up with an excuse to give Choi Han as well for their uniforms when they rescued the dragon. He just blankly stared outside, before shutting the curtains once again.The happy citizens decorating the streets, and the streets that were becoming very beautiful. All of this would turn into a place of despair in a week.\u201cYoung master Taylor.\u201dThey were now at the southern part of Huiss, at the location of the noble residences. Cale\u2019s carriage stopped in front of a building, and Cale stood up and got ready to exit.\u201cRon will take care of you once we arrive at the residence. You just need to head out that way.\u201dHe was looking at the door as he continued.\u201cForget everything.\u201dHe could hear Taylor and Cage\u2019s voice coming from behind him.\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cSee you in a joyful environment next time.\u201dCale started to smile. Cage and Taylor continued to look at him, but neither Cale, nor the two kittens, paid the two people any attention.Click.The carriage door opened.\u201cYoung master, we have arrived.\u201dCale, Hans, and the kittens could all see Taylor and Cage, but did not look at them. They just acted like the two of them weren\u2019t there, and got off the carriage.Cale instantly turned toward the driver\u2019s seat once he got off the carriage. Ron had a benign smile on his face and nodded his head. Ron, who heard the situation from deputy butler Hans, would take care of the rest. Ron headed with the driver to park the carriage.Cale did not pay any more attention to the carriage, and turned around.\u201cOh.\u201dHe then let out a gasp of admiration. The kittens, On and Hong, seemed to be surprised as well, as their golden pupils were extremely dilated.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s even better than I expected.\u201dThe Count really was wealthy. Past the large iron gate was a five-story residence. There was even a garden between the gate and the building itself. It was not fancy or shiny, but it definitely looked more expensive than the nearby noble residences.It had the aura and look of a building that definitely took a large amount of money to build. At the center of it was, naturally, a sculpture with the Henituse family\u2019s golden turtle on it.Screeeech. Bang!The large gate with the golden turtle crest on it slowly opened. The guard opening the gate, as well as the butler of the residence and the servants, all lined up to greet Cale.\u201cYoung master Cale Henituse! Welcome to the capital!\u201dIt was an extremely respectful greeting. They were bowing their heads so low that their heads looked like it would reach the ground. The old man who seemed to be in charge was speaking so loudly it looked like he might hurt his vocal chords.\u201cWe will do our very best to serve you!\u201d\u2018Why is he like this?\u2019Cale looked toward Hans, who was pretending that he had no idea what was going on.\u2018He definitely knows what is going on.\u2019Hans definitely knew the reason they were acting this way. Cale found it annoying to ask, and approached the old man in charge and helped him up. He then looked toward the rest of the servants and started to speak.\u201cEverybody, lift your heads up.\u201dThe servants quickly raised their heads. They had never seen Cale while working at the residence. However, they had definitely heard stories about Cale from the people that visited from the Henituse territory.The trash, Cale. The servants here heard that Cale considered people who worked in the estate as either nobles or useless people. Sometimes, he didn\u2019t even treat them like people. They were anxious about what Cale was going to say next and waited for him to continue.\u201cNo need to be this respectful in the future. I do not like to cause any issues to people who do their job well.\u201dThe servants\u2019 gazes all turned toward Cale. Cale could see that they were all still stiff and started to frown.\u201cI heard that mother picked all of you. She said you all have a lot of pride for your work, so I\u2019m sure you will perform very well.\u201dThe servants\u2019 expressions all turned odd.\u201cAsk Hans if you have any questions.\u201dHe had enough to do as is, so it was better to leave everything to Hans. Plus, there was no reason to pay a lot of attention when he was leaving again in just a few days. Cale looked toward the servants, whose expressions were getting slightly better, and started to walk.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCale walked in front as they headed to the five-story building. When a homeowner enters their house for the first time, they needed to personally walk from the gate to the door of the residence. This symbolized that this was his territory.When the crown prince became the king, the crown prince, no, the king, walked from the castle gate to the center of the palace, where his throne was located. It was a similar kind of logic.Count Deruth and the Countess had walked into this residence like this before, but Cale was now the owner of this large residence.Screeeech-The large iron gate with the golden turtle closed. At the same time, as it usually is with information in the capital, the nearby nobles all learned of the arrival of the Henituse family\u2019s representative. This happened even faster than the person Cale sent to the palace to inform the crown of his arrival could reach the palace.That was why these three people, who were members of the Northeastern Noble\u2019s gathering, started to worry. They started to frown while drinking tea with each other.\u201cSigh\u2026it really is not young master Basen but young master Cale. This is going to make things complicated.\u201d\u201cBut we need to carry him with us, since he is one of our own.\u201d\u201cThat is true. I\u2019m sure even a trash will not act up in front of us, right?\u201dThe neutral Henituse family and the nice, but not flexible, Basen. Then, there was the trash of the Henituse family, Cale. These three, whose families were close to the Henituse family among all of the Northeastern noble families, decided to make the decision that made sense for their future.\u201cWe just need to protect him and prevent him from doing anything stupid. Let\u2019s first meet with him and talk.\u201dTo them, Cale was like a toddler walking by the water that needed their protection. At the same time, Cale was dangerous and could cause a scene at any point. They immediately sent an invitation letter to Cale\u2019s residence, which was quickly delivered into Cale\u2019s hand by that evening.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale threw the letter to the table with an extremely annoyed expression.\u201cWill you not go?\u201d\u201cCan I not go?\u201d\u201cNo. It is a Northeastern nobles meeting.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dNobles were really fast at getting information. Cale was the same way as well. Hans handed the document he received from the residence manager to Cale.\u201cThis is the list of nobles who are currently in the capital.\u201d\u201cGood. Did Ron take care of things properly?\u201dHans had a short response to Cale\u2019s question.\u201cYes.\u201dCale was satisfied with that answer. Cale had prepared a lot for Taylor. A wig, a robe, a wheelchair without the Stan family crest, and even money. He had given everything to Taylor properly. Well, other than the money, Hans handled the delivery process for everything else.\u201cGood work. Get some rest.\u201d\u201cYes sir. I will make sure to get some rest.\u201dHans was not the type to say that he was okay when told to rest. Cale said one more thing, as Hans quickly tried to leave.\u201cAh, but have them send something up for me to eat.\u201d\u201cI will make sure to do so.\u201dHans quickly responded to Cale\u2019s statement, that indicated he would not be going down to the dining room, and soon enough, Cale\u2019s chamber was filled with a feast. Cale looked at the dishes that included meat, desserts, and even wine, and smiled with satisfaction before heading over to the terrace.His chamber was located on the third floor. It was the room that received the most sunlight. He opened the large window heading to the terrace and called out.\u201cCome in.\u201dHe then left the window open and sat down next to the table. Soon enough, Cale could see a couple leaves floating in the sky and sitting down on the chair across from Cale.The dragon had entered the room with a couple of leaves stuck to him.On and Hong also sat down on chairs to the left and right of the invisible dragon.Cale stared at the three of them, before opening the wine bottle and telling them to eat.\u201cGo ahead and eat.\u201dThe red wine filled the glass.\u201cYou gathered ingredients for us, but you never got to eat any of it.\u201dCale brought the wine glass to his lips as he continued to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy following us.\u201dAt that moment, the Black Dragon removed its invisibility magic and revealed itself. On helped remove the leaves that were stuck to the dragon, while Hong stuffed a piece of steak that Beacrox had cooked into the dragon\u2019s mouth.The average age of these three animals was 7 years old. Cale just watched the three animals eat, before pushing more food toward them. Seeing Cale being so nice made On and Hong flinch, while the Black Dragon stopped chewing and just started to observe Cale.Cale took another sip as he started to think.\u2018They\u2019re going to be working very hard in the future.\u2019Since they will need to work on his behalf, the least he could do was feed them well. Maybe it was because they were all so young, but Cale was able to relax for the first time in a long time, even around stronger than average individuals.\u201cIt would be great if it could just stay like this.\u201dA house about this size, delicious food like this, and time to relax. Cale was thinking about how great it would be to live a life with those three things.His goal was to live like this once Basen became the official successor. Cale made up his mind once more. He then turned on the magic music box in the corner.A song that he was not familiar with started playing as Cale took another sip of wine. He could see the sky starting to get darker.\u201cThis is great.\u201d\u2018Now this is living.\u2019Cale had a relaxed smile on his face. At that moment.Knock knock knock.The Black Dragon immediately turned invisible again, while the kittens started to pretend to be normal kittens by washing their faces.\u00a0[1]Cale got up to head to the door.\u201cAh.\u201dClang!He accidentally hit the wine bottle while getting up, and it fell down and broke into pieces. The carpet started to get stained with the red wine.\u2018\u2026 I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019Cale suddenly had a bad feeling for no reason. He quickly headed for the door.\u2018Why do I have such an ominous feeling?\u2019Cale could not figure it out.\u2018Is it Choi Han? No, it can\u2019t be. Unless he travels like a lunatic, there is no way he arrived here already. He won\u2019t be here for another 3 days.\u2019There was no way someone like Choi Han would force an injured Lock to move faster. Even though Choi Han had potions that Cale had given him, the wolf tribe was disowned by the gods. Since potions were made with divine power, it did not work on them.And there was also no way that Rosalyn, the careful and cautious person who hid her magic abilities at first in the novel, would use advanced magic to transport them all to the capital.But, most importantly, Cale had told Choi Han that he would be staying at a specific hotel in the capital. He was going to go meet Choi Han there once before leaving Ron and Beacrox to take care of the rest.\u2018Right. This ominous feeling is just a side effect of hanging around people like Ron or Choi Han for too long.\u2019Cale calmed himself down before vigorously opening the door.\u201c\u2026You-.\u201dCale\u2019s heart sunk as soon as he opened the door. An urgent and desperate voice quickly reached Cale\u2019s ear.\u201cCale-nim. I\u2019m sorry. You were the only person that came to mind.\u201dA desperate Choi Han was standing in front of him. He seemed to have rushed here as quickly as possible, as he looked like a total mess.Cale felt like he had seen the scariest thing in his life. Next to Choi Han was the deputy butler Hans, who had a similar expression as Choi Han, but with a bit of confusion mixed into it. However, the moment Cale saw the person who came with Choi Han, as well as the person on Choi Han\u2019s back, he quickly opened the door.\u201cCome in for now.\u201dThe person on Choi Han\u2019s back was none other than the Wolf Tribe member, Lock.\u201cBring him with you.\u201dLock of the Blue Wolf Tribe, the successor of the Wolf King, seemed to be in a dangerous state.Lock was currently going through the pain before transforming into berserk mode for the first time in his life. Cale did not know why this state that happened a year later in the novel was already happening.However, he looked around at everybody and said just one thing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d1. Something like this\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J_Bl9f-MTAPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Behind Choi Han was Rosalyn. These three people walked into Cale\u2019s room.\u201cHans. Go bring something to drink.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Ah, right away!\u201dCale closed the door without letting deputy butler Hans into the room. Cale then pointed to the bed for Choi Han, who was looking at him, to put Lock down.\u201cLay him down first.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dChoi Han carefully put Lock on the bed. Cale slowly approached Lock. Lock definitely had the purest of pure blood, making him look like a weak human. However, he was pretty tall for being a young boy.\u201cHaaaah, haaaaa, haaaah.\u201dLock was huffing and trying his best to open his eyes. He had a deep frown on his face, and his body was limp, like he could not put any strength into it. It was already too late to prevent the berserk state from arriving.Cale looked at the tall, but still young boy in front of him, who was doing his best to keep his eyes open, and told him to relax.\u201cJust keep your eyes closed. No need to strain yourself.\u201dThere was no strength in Cale\u2019s stern tone, but it had a way of making people listen. Lock slowly closed his eyes. The voice of this man, whom Lock did not know, flowed into Lock\u2019s ear.\u201cEverything will be okay.\u201dLock was huffing and quietly calling for someone. He was calling for his uncle, the chief of the Blue Wolf Tribe, and the man who died for the tribe, even though he was one step away from becoming the Wolf King. His uncle had made sure Lock was hidden before rushing toward the invaders.\u2018Everything will be okay.\u2019That was what his uncle had said to him. Lock started to frown after thinking about his uncle. Cale just ignored him as he turned away.\u201cCale-nim, why is Lock like this?\u201dChoi Han still looked anxious and desperate. Originally in the novel, Choi Han had only slightly opened his heart to Lock by this point.\u2018Just what could have happened?\u2019Cale was not an idiot. He knew that Choi Han\u2019s situation had changed a bit because of him. That was why he was trying really hard to cut off their relationship. He did not ask that question, and let Choi Han continue to speak.\u201cPotions don\u2019t work either. According to Rosalyn, the wolf tribe is one that cannot use potions. Healing magic does not seem to work either. I\u2019m not sure about what to do. I need to protect him. I\u2019m supposed to protect him.\u201d\u201cCalm down.\u201dCale was worried that it would be Choi Han who ended up going berserk if he continued like this. That would be just as scary as that dragon in the corner of the room going berserk. Maybe it was because he lived for tens of years in solitude, actually, even though he lived for tens of years in solitude, Choi Han\u2019s personality remained one where he was a nice guy who cared a lot for things like friendship.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cIf you trust me, just leave him to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026I trust you.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dCale confirmed that Choi Han had calmed down, before turning his gaze over to Rosalyn.Rosalyn. She was the first successor to the throne in the Breck Kingdom. However, this genius mage was ready to throw all of that away. Rosalyn reminded Cale of a red rose. She had red hair that was even brighter than Cale\u2019s, as well as beautiful red lips that currently had their corners lifted up with curiosity.Although she may remind him of a rose, her personality was closer to that of the sun.Rosalyn did not put Lock, Choi Han, or even Cale in her eyes. She was focused at the corner of the room.\u201c\u2026 This aura, this strong aura of mana!\u201dRosalyn was accurately looking at the chair that the dragon had used earlier, while her hands were shaking and clenched tightly.\u201cSigh.\u201dA sigh came out of Cale\u2019s mouth. It seemed like the dragon was curious about this mage. The Black Dragon had sent some mana over to Rosalyn, and showing off some mana skills that Rosalyn could not even dream about. Throughout history, dragons had a tendency to hate humans, but like mages quite a bit.The dragon was doing that because he was happy.Cale looked toward the table that seemed empty, and quietly started to speak.\u201cStop it. Stay still.\u201dAlmost instantly, Rosalyn took a deep breath and quickly returned to normal. The dragon seemed to have removed is mana. Rosalyn could not stop shaking as she looked toward Cale.\u201cJust what-\u201cCale cut her off and pointed to Lock.\u201cThis is more important.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRosalyn\u2019s expression quickly calmed down. She looked at Lock, who was laying down with his eyes closed, and asked Cale.\u201cWhat is going on with Lock right now?\u201dCale looked at the small staff in her hand. The reason they were able to arrive at the capital in just three days was probably because Rosalyn used teleportation magic. Contrary to Cale\u2019s expectations, Rosalyn had already revealed the extent of her abilities.\u201cYou are a mage, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u201cHave you heard anything about the berserk mode of Beast tribes?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRosalyn let out a small noise. However, her face quickly filled with confusion.\u201cI have read about the Wolf Tribe\u2019s berserk mode in books. However, I have never read anything about heating up like this and being in pain.\u201d\u201cIt is because it is his first time.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale continued to speak to the people in the room who were all looking at him.\u201cBeast people lose their sanity during their first time entering berserk mode because of the physical pain from their bodily transformation. If they can persevere past this first painful transformation, they will be able to use the berserk mode as a weapon.\u201dBeast people were at their strongest when they were in berserk mode.Cale observed Lock\u2019s situation before continuing on.\u201cHe will go berserk very soon.\u201dHe then turned to look at Rosalyn. Rosalyn nodded her head at his gaze, and sternly answered.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of person you are, but I am able to read the situation.\u201dAlthough her tone was stern, her eyes were still gentle.\u201cHe is a young boy.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dShe was asking Cale for help, and Cale was agreeing to help.Meeeow.At that moment, the two kittens appeared between the two of them and jumped onto the bed. On and Hong were staring at Lock when\u2026\u201cUgh.\u201dLock revealed his teeth and started to growl at the kittens On and Hong. His instincts were in control over his rationality right now, making him react to other beast people. He looked so vicious that even Choi Han was worried. However\u2026Meeeeeow.Smack.Hong used his front paw to smack Lock\u2019s growling mouth. It was a sharp front paw attack that seemed to be telling Lock to stop it. He then looked toward Cale with eyes that seemed to be asking Cale to hurry up and help Lock.\u201cHe is fine.\u201dCale responded to Hong when there was a knock on the door. When Cale opened the door, Hans had brought drinks, as well as wet towels. Cale gave Hans another order.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cBring something to carry him with.\u201d\u201cYe\u2026excuse me?\u201dCale pointed to Lock on the bed.\u201cPut him on it and take him to the underground training arena. Oh, make sure all of the knights are out of the arena, and that nobody is in there.\u201dHans\u2019s expression seemed to be asking why Cale would move a sick boy to the arena, but Cale just ignored it.\u201cHurry up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dHans had a ton of questions, and was looking at Cale weirdly, but he still did his job. He quickly left to grab something to carry Lock with, while Cale turned around to look at Choi Han and Rosalyn.\u201cChoi Han. And you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Rosalyn.\u201d\u201cYes, Rosalyn.\u201dThe two of them looked away from the bed to look at Cale.\u201cYes, Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dConcern, worry, despair, and sincerity. With all those emotions on their faces, Choi Han and Rosalyn looked more like simple good people rather than heroes. Cale bluntly started to speak to the two of them.\u201cYou two will need to get beat up a bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Excuse me?\u201dAfter a few seconds of silence, Rosalyn seemed shocked, while Choi Han just quietly waited for Cale\u2019s continuing words.\u201cNormally, when beast people with wild beast blood like the Wolf Tribe, Tiger Tribe, and Bear Tribe experience going berserk for the first time, their parents and siblings help take care of it. They take all the attacks of the berserk individual and protect them to make sure they don\u2019t get hurt. That is how they protect their children.\u201dChoi Han and Rosalyn\u2019s expressions turned sour almost instantly. Lock did not have any parents or siblings now. Cale peeked over at Lock, before continuing to speak.\u201cI can tell that is not an option for this child.\u201dClap.Cale clapped once, before pointing at Choi Han and Rosalyn.\u201cThat is why we will pretend that you are the mother and father, or, if you do not like that scenario, then you shall be the older brother and older sister. You two will need to figure out how to protect him.\u201dCale had his \u2018Indestructible Shield,\u2019 but he did not want to take care of Lock\u2019s berserk state. Why should he step in when there were people stronger than him right here?Rosalyn and Choi Han looked at each other.\u201cHe will tire out on his own, and the berserk state will slowly disappear. It is important that his consciousness returns during this first berserk transformation. That is the only way to make him retain his consciousness and rationality the next time he transforms into the berserk mode.\u201dThat would be when his rationality beats out his natural instinct. It was important for beast people to reach that state.Choi Han debated it for a moment, before asking Cale a question.\u201cCale-nim, how long will he maintain his berserk mode?\u201d\u201cHe has the purest of pure blood.\u201d\u201c\u2026So you mean it will take a long time.\u201d\u201cYes. Probably about two hours?\u201dCale approached Lock\u2019s bed, and patted Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIt will be difficult for other people, but Choi Han, it should be easy for you. I trust you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I will succeed. I am Lock\u2019s hyung.\u201d\u00a0[1]Rosalyn looked toward Choi Han with an odd expression. Choi Han had manically killed the assassins to protect the living. During their journey, he was always alert and observing his surroundings. However, such a person seemed extremely relaxed, even though this was a very urgent situation.She then heard Cale\u2019s relaxed voice while she was still watching Choi Han.\u201cYes, yes you are. Let\u2019s eat something delicious after it is done.\u201dCale was thinking about the food and wine he did not get to finish.The door opened at that moment, and Hans entered with Ron and something to carry Lock.\u201cYoung master, the arena has been cleared.\u201d\u201cThat was fast.\u201dCale ordered Choi Han to move the now continuously growling Lock onto the stretcher, before saying the following.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d1. Hyung is the Korean term for an older brother (not necessarily blood-related. As stated in an earlier chapter, Noona is the term for an older sister. However, both are true only if the younger person in this context is male.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The residence\u2019s underground arena. Count Henituse\u2019s territory was famous for its wealth, but that wealth was supported by military strength. How would they be able to survive next to the Forest of Darkness and the dangerous monsters contained within it without a strong military strength?That was why their residences had underground training arenas that were larger and better than most Duke or Marquis\u2019s residences. Cale gave an order as soon as they entered the large underground arena.\u201cThe two of you stay out of the arena as well. Secure the area, and make sure nobody comes in from the first floor.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d\u201cI understand, young master.\u201dCale had a bitter taste in his mouth at the fact that Ron had an extremely wide smile on his face, but Cale chose to let it go. After watching the two people go away, Cale carried the kittens and went to the corner of the arena. Naturally, he did not forget to motion for Choi Han and Rosalyn to go very far away.\u201cThe two of you head to the center!\u201dChoi Han took Lock to the center of the arena. Rosalyn had a serious look on her face, as she got a bit farther away from Lock.\u201cGrowl!\u201dLock was shaking like he was having a seizure. His arms, legs, his entire body was shaking. However, neither Rosalyn nor Choi Han approached him.It was because Lock was growing claws. Very sharp claws that belonged to a wild animal.\u201cAaaaaaaah!\u201dLock\u2019s body floated up in the air. It stiffened up like an arrow, before slowly starting to change. Cale verified that the large iron gate into the arena was closed tightly, before slowly heading farther into the corner with the kittens, On and Hong, also following him.\u2018This is no joke.\u2019Cale could see the tall and weak Lock slowly starting to change.\u201cGrooooowl, aaaaaaaah!\u201dLock now grew out some sharp fangs, before screaming in agony. He started to slowly get up and staggered a bit, before starting to frown and opening his eyes. He then looked toward the ceiling and let out a howl.\u201cAhwoooooooooooo!\u201dIn that instant, a half-transparent barrier appeared in front of Cale. It was a shield. While On and Hong looked around in shock, Cale just casually started to speak.\u201cDragon, you really are amazing. Can you make it soundproof as well?\u201dAnother shield overlapped the existing one. Rosalyn peeked over, and Cale could see her shock in seeing the two layers of shields in front of Cale. At that moment, the voice of the Black Dragon, that must be somewhere inside of this shield, filled Cale\u2019s ear.\u201cYou are very weak. That is why you need protection.\u201dOn and Hong were excited to realize it was the dragon, but looked at Cale with pity after hearing what the dragon had to say. They seemed to agree with the dragon\u2019s assessment. Cale ignored their gazes, and casually answered back.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d\u201cI do not know why you are not using that power.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dThe power. The Black Dragon quickly realized that Cale did not want to show that ancient power to other people, and left it vague. Cale shrugged his shoulders and, in the end, a third shield was created for a total of a three-layered shield.\u2018His skill is growing exponentially.\u2019Dragons learned magic differently than humans. Dragons controlled magic with their will. Cale thought that the Black Dragon\u2019s speed of improvement was surprising, but that it also made it much more useful for him.Cale could now peacefully watch Lock transforming into berserk mode down on the ground.\u201cGrowl, aaaaaaah!\u201dLock\u2019s screams filled the arena. If it wasn\u2019t for the soundproof and shockproof magic that was installed around the basement, the knights of the residence would have all quickly rushed down.Lock\u2019s body became larger every time he let out a shout. Muscles that weren\u2019t there previously started to develop, and his eyes turned red. It was proof that he was losing his consciousness.Why did that little boy from the Blue Wolf Tribe go berserk?In the novel, Lock would experience his first berserk transformation one year later. The reason for that was the death of an individual.\u2018Healer Pendrick.\u2019That elf ends up dying in battle. Pendrick was someone who reminded Lock of his dead uncle, the chief of the Blue Wolf Tribe. Seeing Pendrick dying makes Lock go crazy, wanting to kill everything and everyone in sight.\u201cOn, Hong.\u201dCale looked down toward the siblings who were huddled together inside the shield.\u201cThe two of you haven\u2019t experienced the berserk transformation yet, right?\u201dThe kittens nodded their heads.\u201cDo you know anything about it?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cNobody taught us about it.\u201dCale knew this would be the case. Since On and Hong also seemed to be pure blooded, their berserk transformation would be rough as well. Cale looked forward once again, and started to speak.\u201cThe Wolf Tribe, Tiger Tribe, Bear Tribe, and the Whale Tribe, these four tribes lose their rationality the most during the first berserk transformation. That is why we call these four tribes the Beast People closest to monsters.\u201dHe did not know much about the Cat Tribe.\u201cI do not know how the beserk transformation will be for the Cat Tribe, but if you feel like you are going to go berserk or suddenly feel yourself heating up or hurting, immediately come to me.\u201d\u2018It would be bad if you caused an accident.\u2019Who would have to clean it up? Cale would have to clean up after them. Cale was someone who took full responsibility for things that happened in his territory, and the people he took in.Cale turned to look at them after not hearing any response. The two pairs of golden pupils of the kittens were turned toward Cale, and they both quickly headed to his leg and started to rub their faces at his leg.\u2018Why are they like this?\u2019Cale didn\u2019t like how chummy they were being, and moved his leg slightly to the side. As he did that, Cale heard something that gave him the chills.\u201cDo dragons go berserk?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIt would be crazy for dragons to have berserk transformations. If a dragon went berserk, multiple mountains would disappear in an instant. That was a very scary thought. Cale\u2019s expression stiffened more than ever before, as he continued to look forward. It was his way of saying he did not want to hear anything more about it.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe could hear the sound of the dragon clicking its tongue in the air. While Cale was thinking about the fickleness of this dragon, Lock\u2019s berserk transformation was finally completed.Boom.The werewolf standing on two legs stomped on the ground, making the entire arena shake.The fur of the Blue Wolf Tribe was a dark blue color. The fierce werewolf, that could no longer be called a boy, became covered in that dark blue fur. Lock swung his arm that was now covered in muscles that were incomparably larger than Choi Han\u2019s muscles, to attack with his extremely sharp claws.\u201cLock!\u201d\u201cLock, snap out of it!\u201dChoi Han and Rosalyn tried to call out to him, but to Lock, who had lost his rationality, they were just lifeforms he needed to attack.\u201cGroooowl.\u201dA rough growl came out of Lock\u2019s mouth. This wolf, that was at least 1.5 times Choi Han\u2019s height, rushed toward him.\u201cLock, snap out of it! It\u2019s me! Choi Han!\u201dChoi Han could not attack his companion, and thus only defended as he called out to Lock. But would that do anything to make Lock return to normal? Of course not. Cale shook his head and continued to watch.\u201cJust smacking him on the head and making him faint would be the fastest way.\u201dGasp. The two kittens gasped and crept away from Cale.Although Cale was saying that, he had no intentions of making Choi Han do something like that. A Beast person who faints like that during their first berserk transformation would lose their rationality to the transformation once again in the future.\u201cWow.\u201dThe berserk werewolf\u2019s attack was stronger than Cale expected. The fact that he was moving based on instinct made him utilize his muscles very efficiently.\u201cOn, Hong.\u201dCale called the kitten siblings over. There was a reason he had the two of them come with him.\u201cWatch that Wolf Tribe kid\u2019s movements.\u201dHe wanted On and Hong to pay close attention to the werewolf Lock. Lock was relentlessly charging toward Choi Han and Rosalyn. There was no retreating for Lock. That was the Wolf Tribe\u2019s style. Cale spoke as if he was whispering to the kittens.\u201cThat is the instinctual movements of a Beast person. The fact that they can move based on instinct, unlike humans, is one of the beauty and gloriousness of the Beast Tribes.\u201dBang!Lock\u2019s fist smashed onto the ground and broke the marble floor. He was showing tremendous strength.\u201cYou should not fear or dread going berserk. That is when Beast People are at their strongest.\u201dPat.Cale\u2019s hand patted the two kitten\u2019s heads.\u201cAlthough the Cat Tribe and Wolf Tribe are different, the two of you are Beast People as well. Watch him to learn the style of a wild animal, the style of relying on your instincts. And then-\u201dThe two pairs of golden pupils made eye contact with Cale.\u201cMake it your own. Either that, or think of a way to kill those bears, tigers, wolves, the ones labeled as wild beasts.\u201dThe kittens, the Cat Tribe children, immediately turned away from Cale to observe Lock. The kittens stood up on their hind legs and observed Lock\u2019s every move. Silver and red, the two kitten\u2019s furs stood up as they became extremely nervous.Cats were weak compared to these wild beasts. It was because they were a tribe that relied on stealth that they clearly understood Cale\u2019s intent. Cale watched the kittens for a while, before calling out to the dragon.\u201cHey.\u201dThe Black Dragon revealed itself in the air. Rosalyn and Choi Han did not have time to look toward them. They had to put their full attention on Lock. Cale pointed to the two people as he continued to speak to the dragon.\u201cLook at how Rosalyn uses her magic to not hurt the opponent. Also look at how Choi Han is using his aura not to attack, but to protect himself while not harming that wolf child.\u201dTang, tang, tang!Lock\u2019s extremely quick fists were trying to break through Rosalyn\u2019s shield. Rosalyn desperately called out to Lock while watching him attack.\u201cLock, you remember me right? I said you were part of my family now. Hurry up and snap out of it!\u201dChoi Han turned Lock\u2019s gaze over to him. He raised his murderous aura to the maximum to get Lock\u2019s attention.\u201cLock, attack me. I am the one who will protect you.\u201dLock responded to the murderous aura by swinging his claw toward Choi Han. Even though Lock\u2019s attack did not have any aura in it, his full physical strength was behind that attack.Cale was watching that scene from far away while continuing to speak to the dragon.\u201cIt is harder to not hurt something than it is to hurt something when you have immense strength. But I know you will be able to quickly pick it up, since you are a dragon.\u201dThe dragon responded to Cale.\u201cI am a dragon. There is nothing I cannot do.\u201d\u201cCorrect. So watch them and make your own judgment.\u201dThe dragon flew down and landed next to the kittens before turning invisible once again. Cale presumed the dragon would take in Rosalyn, Choi Han, and Lock\u2019s movements like the kittens were doing.\u2018Should I have brought some wine with me?\u2019Cale lamented the fact that he had no wine, as he continued to watch this boring battle. Two hours. For the duration of a typical movie, these three animal children kept their eyes on the battle, while Choi Han and Rosalyn started to get exhausted.\u201c.. Huff, huff, huff.\u201dBut the one who was the most exhausted was the werewolf.\u201cHuff, huff. Hyung-.\u201d\u201cLock!\u201dChoi Han reacted to the word, \u2018hyung,\u2019 and rushed toward the staggering werewolf. Although he was not completely out of the berserk mode, Choi Han\u2019s reaction made Cale stand up.\u201cNoo, noona-.\u201dLock was able to recognize Rosalyn as well.\u201cAh, Lock!\u201dRosalyn rushed over as well to hug Lock. Lock was still covered in the dark blue fur, but his eyes were starting to become focused. Lock was not hurt at all, while Rosalyn and Choi Han had small injuries on their bodies.The two of them protected Lock like he was family.\u201cSo, huff huff, sorry.\u201dHis rationality had returned. It was a perfect first berserk mode transformation, where he was able to overcome all issues. Lock put his head on Rosalyn, who was half his height, and then this 13 year-old boy started to cry. An animalistic noise was mixed in with his crying.\u201cLock!\u201dLock then slowly turned back into his human form, before starting to fall. The berserk mode transformation was over. Choi Han quickly approached him and prevented him from falling over. Lock was doing his best to not faint, as he was worried that he would return to his berserk state.At that moment, a man carrying two kittens arrived in front of this boy who was trying his best to keep his eyes open.\u2018Uncle.\u2019It was the man who said the same thing as his uncle. The man started to speak.\u201cYou can rest now.\u201dThe man smiled, and made Lock close his eyes like before.\u201cIt is all over now.\u201dLock finally relaxed and closed his eyes after hearing the man\u2019s words. Lock leaned on Choi Han and fainted. Choi Han carefully laid Lock back down on the stretcher.Cale, who had been watching this, took a potion out of the bag and threw it toward Rosalyn. Rosalyn caught the potion bottle and asked.\u201cPotions don\u2019t work on Lock?\u201dCale looked at Rosalyn in a way that seemed to be asking why she was saying something that was so obvious, and answered the still confused Rosalyn.\u201cWhy would I give a potion to someone from the Wolf Tribe? It\u2019s for you. You struggled quite a bit.\u201dRosalyn stared at Cale. She had seen an amazing sight of a three-layered magic, and had many things she wanted to ask Cale. However, she said something else.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dThis had to come first.\u201cNo need for thanks.\u201dCale casually responded and turned away. He could see Choi Han who was already looking at him.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dJust how did this happen? He needed to figure out what happened.\u201cWe need to talk.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Guide the two people still in the Arena.\u201dCale had Hans and Ron, who were waiting outside the first floor entrance, take care of Rosalyn and Lock while Cale was returning to his room with Choi Han.The table which held the now cold food from earlier was between the two of them, as Cale started to speak.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe two of them got right to the point without beating around the bush. Choi Han straightened up, as he started to speak.\u201cEverything was fine until I met Rosalyn.\u201d\u201cContinue.\u201d\u201cI arrived at the city Cale-nim mentioned. Once I got there, I found the merchant guild heading for the capital as you described. Well, it was just a small brigade of five people rather than a guild.\u201dThat small group was better described as a merchant group rather than a merchant guild.\u201cThey happened to be looking for two mercenaries to guard them. Their usual guard was injured.\u201dChoi Han and Rosalyn became the two mercenaries. That was how it went in the novel.\u201cThat was where I met Rosalyn, who looked just like you described.\u201dBreck Kingdom was across the Northwest border of the Roan Kingdom. Rosalyn was originally heading from Breck Kingdom to the Magic Tower in the Whipper Kingdom, located beneath the Roan Kingdom, when someone tries to assassinate her as she crossed into the Roan Kingdom.She had been hiding about half of her magic skills until that point and is able to escape from the danger by using all of her skills. She thought it would be smarter to go to the capital of the Roan Kingdom and get some information from the Information Guild rather than going straight back to the Breck Kingdom, since she did not know anything about the people who attacked her.\u2018She then causes quite the scene when she gets back to Breck Kingdom.\u2019Choi Han, who just mentioned that he had met Rosalyn as a mercenary for the merchant group, continued on.\u201cShe was also heading to the capital. Since we were heading to the same place, we were quite friendly with each other.\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019\u201cHmm? Friendly?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChoi Han was speaking as if he was embarrassed.\u201cI\u2019m generally not one to talk to people if they don\u2019t talk to me, but I thought we might as well be friendly.\u201d\u201cNot really. You just have to act like your usual self.\u201dCale had a concerned expression on his face. In the novel, Rosalyn and Choi Han did not get close to each other until they met Lock. Rosalyn, who became wary of people after the assassination attempt, did not reach out to be friendly with anybody. Similarly, after the incidents in Harris Village, Choi Han was not the type to approach people to become friends.Choi Han nodded his head at Cale\u2019s words, before smiling and adding on.\u201cIt definitely was not something I would normally do, but I wanted to do things properly since this was my way to pay you back.\u201dHa. Cale let out a sigh and shook his head. Choi Han seemed to have expected it, as he brushed it aside and continued to speak with a stiff expression.\u201cThat group was planning on staying at the village that Cale-nim mentioned I would find Lock residing in for a few days before continuing onward on their journey.\u201dThat was indeed the case. That small merchant group of five people was made by someone who had been helped by the Blue Wolf Tribe. The injured guard was actually a warrior from the Blue Wolf Tribe.The merchants deliberately chose to take the long way from Puzzle City to the capital to deliver daily necessities to the Blue Wolf Tribe and receive medicinal herbs in return.Of course, it was extremely difficult, as well as a waste of even more time to go deep into the mountains to the Blue Wolf Village. That was why they met at a tiny village underneath the mountains. That merchant, who was now 60 years old, had continued this partnership for the last thirty years.\u201cBut something happened once we arrived at that small village.\u201dCale became alert. The story was important from here.\u201cRight around when we arrived at the village, I learned that the guard was a Beast Person. I also learned that the village they were planning to meet the Blue Wolf Tribe member to trade was the village that Cale-nim had mentioned as well.\u201dCale nodded his head at Choi Han\u2019s words. He knew Choi Han would easily recognize that much.\u201cThat was why I believed that I just needed to follow the tribe member that was going to show up at the village to find Lock.\u201d\u2018But that tribe member probably never showed up.\u2019\u201cBut nobody showed up to make the trade. When that happened, the merchant asked us for some extra help.\u201dCale thought about what that request would have been.\u2018Go to the Blue Wolf Village with the injured Blue Wolf Tribe guard.\u2019\u201cIt was if we could go visit the Blue Wolf Village with the injured guard.\u201d\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d\u201cYes. I agreed. Rosalyn agreed as well.\u201dIt followed the original story until this point. Just what could have changed?In, \u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 Choi Han and Rosalyn arrive at the Blue Wolf Village with the guard warrior, only to find the village destroyed and the secret organization\u2019s assassins trying to leave. Choi Han recalls what happened to Harris Village, and immediately starts to attack them. The guard warrior also goes crazy and starts to kill the assassins. He is injured even more in the process, and ends up dying.\u2018That is when Rosalyn learns of Choi Han\u2019s strength.\u2019Rosalyn, who had been hiding her strength and masquerading as a beginner mage, learns of Choi Han\u2019s strength and officially asks him to escort her back to Breck Kingdom. Of course, the compensation she offered him was huge.\u2018They then find Lock hiding in that destroyed village.\u2019The coward wolf boy, Lock. Until Choi Han found him, Lock had been hiding as the chief had told him. The Lock at that point is very much a coward, a weakling, and kind of slow. In simple terms, Lock easily took the position of the character that readers found to be extremely frustrating.However, his natural abilities and physical strength rise to the top five in the novel after his first berserk mode transformation.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u2018But why would the timing of the transformation be pulled forward by a year?\u2019\u201cI saw something I was familiar with there.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see?\u201dChoi Han nodded his head at Cale\u2019s question. The cold food was between the two of them, but it could probably be heated up by the nervousness that filled the air between them. Choi Han started to speak.\u201cA red star and five white stars.\u201dCale\u2019s expression stiffened. He could feel his heart sink. Choi Han was saying that, instead of the assassination team, official members of the secret organization showed up at the Blue Wolf Tribe. Cale could not understand why. In the novel, the Blue Wolf Tribe was the target of assassination.Choi Han looked at Cale\u2019s cold expression and recalled the past for a moment. He subconsciously started to clench his fists. His fists were shaking with anger.The houses in the village deep in the mountains were simple and small. But all of them were destroyed. Most importantly, the corpses of the Wolf Tribe were completely black, as if they were burnt to a crisp on the floor. The black corpses, what smelled like burnt flesh, and the blood that was still pouring out of their open wounds. Most of the Wolf Tribe members died with their eyes still open.\u201cThe mountain village was already destroyed when we got there. Many of the Wolf Tribe members were dead as well.\u201dThe Blue Wolf Tribe was known for their strength, so how did the secret organization kill them?Wolves put their family, herd, and friends before themselves.Weak members who had not experienced their first berserk mode transformation. The secret organization used those weak members as hostages, before using divine items to weaken the adult wolves. After killing the adults, they then killed the young hostages. There were a few adult wolves that tried to attack them in frenzy, but the secret organization had Holy Water to use against those few wolves.The secret organization was a very strong organization, that even had access to divine items. They used the fact that the Wolf Tribe was disowned by the gods to their advantage. These cruel bastards had no issues using young children as hostages to kill their mothers, fathers, and the rest of the tribe members, while the poor young children watched in horror.\u2018The novel didn\u2019t say which of the divine items they brought.\u2019If Cale knew what the divine item was, he would be able to get one step closer to the identity of the secret organization. Unfortunately, the novel only described how the Wolf Tribe became weak because of the divine item. He had no way to determine the identity of the secret organization.Cale slowly asked.\u201cWere they all dead?\u201dChoi Han shook his head. Cale\u2019s expression stiffened again. Choi Han observed Cale\u2019s stiff expression, as he continued.\u201cThey were trying to capture the young children.\u201d\u2018Capture? Originally, they killed them all. Why would they want the young Wolf Tribe children?\u2019Cale\u2019s mind started to become complicated. Choi Han made eye contact with the Cale who was thinking deeply.\u201cThe chief was dying when we arrived at the entrance of the Blue Wolf Tribe\u2019s village.\u201dThere were less than 100 members of the Blue Wolf Tribe.\u201cAnd they were trying to take 10 children with them.\u201d\u2018\u2026This is becoming too different from the novel.\u2019\u201cAnd the moment the chief was about to fall, a young boy got in the way of the people trying to take the children.\u201d\u201c\u2026Lock?\u201d\u201cYes. It was Lock.\u201d\u2018Why would Lock show up this time? In the novel, he had stayed hidden, even when the children were killed. Did he think killing and kidnapping were different? Was it his instinctual need to protect his family members and his younger siblings, who were weaker than him? What would have made Lock\u2019s natural wolf instincts flare up?\u2019\u201cI stopped the assassin. No, I tried to kill them.\u201dChoi Han said that as he looked back at Cale. Cale did not show any emotions as he urged Choi Han to continue speaking.\u201cKeep going.\u201d\u201c\u2026I realized that the people who did not have stars on their clothes used the same black power as the assassins I killed at Harris Village.\u201dCale asked back with a shocked expression.\u201cIt was the same power as the people who destroyed Harris Village?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026This.\u201dCale grabbed his head with one hand and let out a sigh. He was acting like it was his first time hearing about this. Of course, all of this was just an act.\u201cAmong them, there was just one person who had the red star with five white stars on their chest. That person was the one who killed the guard.\u201dChoi Han started to tear up.\u201cAnd that trash of a human was drinking the Wolf Tribe\u2019s blood.\u201dCale closed his eyes.The blood drinking mage. She was the crazy lunatic who would lead the terror incident at the capital. He kept his eyes closed as he heard the rest of Choi Han\u2019s report.\u201cIn the end, I could not capture or kill them. The ones I captured committed suicide, while the rest disappeared when the person with the stars used teleportation magic.\u201d\u2018Why would the blood drinking mage, who is a highest tier mage and crazy for blood, try to kidnap the Blue Wolf Tribe children instead of killing all of them like in the novel?\u2019Cale could not figure it out.\u2018Did something change drastically because I saved the dragon?\u2019The only thing Cale could think about was the changes he has made so far to the original story.\u201cThis is what the mage said.\u201dChoi Han continued in an angry and bitter voice.\u201cHow disappointing. They were perfect as seeds. These young ones probably have even tastier blood.\u201dSeed. Cale didn\u2019t know what the mage meant by seed, but he kept the word on the back of his mind as he opened his eyes and asked.\u201cAnd the children?\u201dThe guard, chief, and the rest of the Wolf Tribe adults were dead. The only ones left were the 10 children and Lock.Choi Han avoided Cale\u2019s gaze. This was the first time he did that since they sat down at this table. Cale instantly figured out what must have happened, as Choi Han reported in a quiet voice.\u201cThey are at the inn.\u201d\u2018I knew it.\u2019Choi Han opened and closed his mouth a few more times before finally adding on.\u201cWe came together with Rosalyn\u2019s magic.\u201d\u2018\u2026It\u2019s going to be a real problem.\u2019Cale could feel a headache brewing. Choi Han should have just left the children with that merchant that they were travelling with. Although that merchant was far away from power right now, he was a great merchant.\u201cCale-nim. That merchant is also at the inn.\u201d\u2018Is this how the story will go?\u2019That was what Cale was thinking right now. Cale observed Choi Han, who seemed to be finished with his report, and leaned back on the chair to sigh.Seeing Choi Han like that, Cale asked a question.\u201cYou must be curious.\u201dChoi Han looked toward the cold food and answered.\u201cYes. I am curious.\u201dHe did not even need to say what he was curious about.Who they were.Why they were doing such terrible things.And why Cale knew about them.Choi Han was curious about all of those things. Cale observed Choi Han\u2019s pupils, that were looking down at the cold food on the table, and started to think.\u2018This punk is really angry right now.\u2019The anger was not directed toward Cale. Choi Han was sharpening his anger toward the secret organization over and over again, like a sharp blade. Harris Village, the tortured dragon, and the incident with the Blue Wolf Tribe. Choi Han\u2019s personally was one where he would clash with them instead of avoiding them.Cale picked up a cold, but still delicious bread, and ripped off a piece to put into his mouth.\u201cI plan on telling you two things.\u201d\u201c\u2026But not everything?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dCale did not care that Choi Han was staring at him. He stood up with the bread still in his hand. The chair was pushed back without making a noise on the carpet.\u201cStand up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are we going somewhere?\u201dCale checked his watch after watching Choi Han get up after him. It was long past evening and heading toward night. That place was one to shine even brighter as the night got deeper.Cale walked toward the door and responded to Choi Han\u2019s question.\u201cThe Temple of the God of Death.\u201dCale was planning on going with Choi Han to the brightest place at night, the Temple of the God of Death.There was a special type of priest at the Temples of the God of Death that could not be found anywhere else on the continent.The deaf official.They could not hear anything you said to each other. That was why the believers of the God of Death looked for them. Although Cale was not a believer, he was planning on visiting them, like most nobles.Cale turned around once he got to the door. Choi Han was still standing by the table. Cale started to smile.\u201cI plan on telling you two truths.\u201dAlthough he was smiling, the next thing out of his mouth was not light at all.\u201cWith my life on the line.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s pupils lightly shook. However, Cale still had a smile on his face as he turned back around.\u201cFollow me.\u201dChoi Han slowly moved away from the table and headed toward the door. His eyes had calmed back down, but his face was still stiff. Cale was turning the doorknob as he repeated himself once again.\u201cI will tell you the truth with my life on the line.\u201dCale headed toward the Temple of the God of Death with Choi Han.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ron seemed to have gone somewhere as well, as he was nowhere to be found. The only question Hans had for Cale was about where Cale was going.\u2018Young master, where are you going?\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u2018Yes, sir! But since this is your first day in the capital, can you please return without breaking any alcohol bottles today?\u2019\u2018\u2026Are you really going to keep getting out of line like this?\u2019\u2018Not at all. Please be safe, young master.\u2019Cale got on the carriage and started to think about how to deal with Hans, who kept stepping out of line. The carriage arrived at the temple while he was thinking.\u201cLet\u2019s get off.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dCale got up to step out of the carriage. Choi Han had been quiet ever since they got on the carriage, no, since they stepped out of Cale\u2019s room. He seemed to have a lot of complicated emotions storming through his head right now.Cale only knew about Choi Han\u2019s personality until the fifth volume of, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 However, there was one thing that Cale was sure about. Although Choi Han was a good person, he was not gullible. He was very smart.\u2018If I tried to give an unbelievable excuse, he may believe me at first, but will definitely doubt me later.\u2019Choi Han may have been very lonely after living in solitude for tens of years, but that experience taught him how to survive on his own, and how to stubbornly persevere.Choi Han may look at him favorably right now and follow him, but, as seen around volume 5 of, \u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 he is someone who eventually wishes to be the leader. Choi Han is someone who will live to make his personal view of justice a reality.\u201c\u2026It is too white.\u201dThe Temple of the God of Death that Cale saw once he alighted was completely white, without a speck of dirt to be seen. The believers of the God of Death considered white to be the color of death, and cleaned everything over and over again every single day to make sure there was not a speck of dust anywhere on the building.\u2018What an interesting place.\u2019The Temple of the God of Death looked like it wanted to show that people had nothing to fear about the night with their actions. They opened the temple to both believers and non-believers once the sun started to set.\u2018Apparently, the priests are all sleeping if you come during the day.\u2019It really was an interesting place in Cale\u2019s opinion. They were greeted by two priests at the temple entrance.\u201cMay you be blessed with a peaceful rest!\u201d\u201cMay you be blessed with a peaceful rest!\u201dThe priests of the God of Death were generally extremely bubbly. Although people may consider death to be the end, the philosophy of the Church of the God of Death believed that it was important to enjoy life as they headed toward the peaceful rest.\u201cPriest-nim.\u201dCale slowly approached the priest. The priest inspected Cale with a curious expression. Cale looked like he was either an extremely affluent noble or a wealthy merchant based on his outfit. But the man behind him looked like a beggar, although the sword on his waist made him look somewhat strong.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\u201cIs there an open Room of Death?\u201dThe two priests\u2019 expressions stiffened. The priest who asked the question looked back and forth between Cale and Choi Han before asking.\u201cWhose death will you be putting on the line?\u201dThe priest peeked toward Choi Han as he said that. Choi Han currently looked like he had been rolling on a mountain and been suffering for a while. He also looked like he had not eaten anything for about two days, and seemed to be the type that would be easily scammed. The priest had a bitter feeling about this.The priest turned his gaze over to the affluent noble. Beautiful red hair and a handsome face. He was not very handsome, but it was enough to catch attention wherever he went. In addition, this man was currently smiling.Cale smiled as he slightly raised his hand.\u201cMine.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dCale smiled once more at the confused priest.\u201cI will be putting my life on the line.\u201dChoi Han put his hand on Cale\u2019s shoulder at that time.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCale turned around to see Choi Han with a stiff, yet anxious expression.\u201cI will believe you even if you don\u2019t do this.\u201dCale started to smirk and slowly responded.\u201cI don\u2019t think you will.\u201dChoi Han will have no choice but to not believe him. How could he believe Cale when Cale was not planning to tell him anything? That was why they were at the temple.\u2018Why would I tell him everything? That\u2019ll just make me get involved in the mess.\u2019There was no reason for him to get involved with Choi Han that much. Cale wouldn\u2019t be able to live a peaceful life if Choi Han was around. It\u2019s already visible. Didn\u2019t Choi Han bring him more trouble to him by bringing all of the wolf children?\u2018He rides on the whales with the Whale Tribe to fight against mermaids in the future.\u2019In this human-centric world, Choi Han\u2019s position to embrace both humans and non-humans makes him start to change. The start of that is the Whale Tribe. The Whale Tribe that appeared at the beginning of volume 5 was, to be honest, quite scary.\u2018They were the deadliest predators.\u2019The Whale Tribe was the strongest of the Beast people. They were also the most beautiful Beast people. The Whale Tribe had different colors of black, grey, or pink, but they were all extremely beautiful. In comparison, the mermaids of this world had two legs and fins, looking like a human covered in scales.\u2018But they are so stubborn that they won\u2019t even be humble in front of a dragon.\u2019The Whale Tribe was extremely scary. Although they were small in number, their casual punch could easily blow up a human\u2019s head. Even Lock could not lift a finger to the Whale Tribe.\u2018Their temper is ruthless.\u2019Choi Han gets involved with all sorts of people and trouble as well. Cale had no desire to continue being involved with him.\u201cPriest-nim. The room?\u201d\u201cYes, we have one. I will prepare it for you right away. Please head to the basement.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dCale started to walk behind the priest. Choi Han followed behind Cale with an iffy expression. Cale noticed Choi Han\u2019s movement, and leisurely walked toward the innermost area of the temple.After walking for a long time, they could see numerous doors on one side of the wall. The priest opened one of those doors to reveal a staircase leading down into the basement.\u201cDeath awaits you at the bottom.\u201d\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe priest watched Cale walking down the stairs without any hesitation with interest.The, \u2018death,\u2019 that is mentioned in the Temple of Death also meant, \u2018vow.\u2019Death was something that was guaranteed to visit you at some point. It was not something you could avoid, and your responsibility was to accept your role in the world while you are here.That was why the officials of the Temple of the God of Death brought the end known as death for those who go against their vow.Because of this, people who headed to this Room of Death, or sometimes called the Room of Vows, tended to be humble and serious. In contrast, this relaxed and confident person was really unique in the priest\u2019s eyes.\u2018It makes me think about priestess Cage.\u2019She was someone who cursed the temple extremely frequently, but she was still loved by the lord. Cage. The priest suddenly thought about her, but quickly erased it from her thoughts. At the same time, Cage was becoming frustrated while hearing the lord\u2019s voice again.After getting rid of the thoughts about Cage, the priest headed down the stairs behind Cale. Once they got to the bottom, the priest opened the door and informed Cale and Choi Han.\u201cPlease wait a moment. I will get it ready.\u201dThe priest then entered into the room alone. Cale looked toward the closed door and started to speak.\u201cIf you really don\u2019t think we need to do this, I will let you know one of the truths in advance. What do you think?\u201dChoi Han immediately responded.\u201cYes, please tell me. I trust you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCale rubbed his chin with one hand before casually spitting the truth out.\u201cThe first of the two truths.\u201dHis gaze turned toward Choi Han.\u201cI do not know the secret organization\u2019s identity nor their goal.\u201d\u201c\u2026What the-\u201dChoi Han\u2019s pupils started to shake. At that moment, they heard a click and the priest came back out of the room.\u201cYou can enter now. The person putting their life on the line just needs to raise their hand once inside the room for the priest-nim.\u201d\u201cThank you. We understand.\u201dCompared to the relaxed Cale, Choi Han seemed extremely confused and anxious. The priest tilted his head in confusion at this, but quietly left the area. It was none of his business. Cale grabbed the doorknob as he turned to look back at Choi Han.\u201cHard to believe?\u201d\u201cThat, you see.\u201dCale could see Choi Han struggling to answer. Choi Han had said he trusted Cale, but he could not trust Cale\u2019s words. How could Cale not know? Did that make any sense? Choi Han then heard Cale\u2019s voice in his ear.\u201cI understand.\u201dChoi Han looked toward Cale. Cale\u2019s relaxed expression made him seem very mature. Cale then started to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dChoi Han followed Cale into the Room of Death that was behind the white door.As expected, the room was completely white, with a white table, white chair, and white walls. The only non-white thing in the room was the priest who was standing there with his mouth and ears covered.The deaf priest. Cale did not really look favorably upon that title, but these priests were pretty well respected in this world. Nobles and royalty, anybody who needed to have a secret conversation or stealthily sign a contract came to see these priests.Cale silently bowed his head to greet the priest before raising his hand. The priest nodded at Cale\u2019s action and pointed to the two chairs by the table.Cale sat down on the right side while Choi Han sat across from him on the left. The priest moved to the head of the table before pushing a piece of paper toward them.[For the person who is putting their life on the line. The hand of the God of Death will touch the one who came with you. Once that happens, you can say your vow. Should you break your vow, death awaits you.]What a vicious set of directions.Cale pushed the paper back to the priest after verifying that Choi Han had finished reading. The priest then lifted both of his hands up like Cage had done before. At that moment.Ooooooooong- oooooooong-The white room started to shake. Maybe it was because this was a place that served the lord, but a black smoke started to form around the priest once the room started to shake. The black smoke then surrounded both Choi Han and Cale before creating a connection between the two of them.\u201c\u2026Is this the power of the God of Death?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale responded to Choi Han\u2019s question before trying to feel the black smoke thread surrounding him. It happened when Cage made the vow as well, but the power of the God of Death reminded him of the stakes of this vow.\u2018I will die if I break this vow.\u2019Cale was sure Choi Han felt it as well. That must be why his face stiffened up. Cale could feel the touch of the God of Death and started his vow.\u201cThe priest in front of me guarantees that he cannot hear, and, if that is not the truth, he will pay the price with his life.\u201dThis was the general phrase stated first whenever a vow was made with a deaf priest.\u201cFurthermore, I, Cale Henituse, vow to speak the truth to Choi Han in front of the God of Eternal Rest, and, if what I say is even slightly a lie, I will immediately die in this spot to pay the price.\u201dImmediately. That word made Choi Han\u2019s face stiffen up even more. He was nervous.At first, Cale debated whether to tell Choi Han everything.I was transported into the novel I was reading. I am also Korean. That is why I know what happens until volume 5. This secret organization goes on to cause issues throughout the continent. The continent soon falls into a state of chaos because of a war.Should Cale say all of that?Or, should he say something like this? I was transported into the novel I was reading and ended up as the son of a wealthy noble. That was why I was trying to just live a peaceful life, but I remembered what happened in the novel so I changed it around a bit. I wanted to allow myself to live peacefully, even if the continent was in a state of war.Cale didn\u2019t like either of them. The first one might get him involved in the continent\u2019s war and make him die out on the battlefield, while the second one might lead to Choi Han\u2019s contempt killing him.Cale did not want either of those to happen.\u201cFirst.\u201dFirst of the two truths.\u201cI, Cale Henituse, do not know the identity of that organization.\u201dSigh. Choi Han let out a deep sigh before covering his face with both hands. He slowly moved his hands away after a bit to see that Cale was still alive.\u201cI am being honest when I say that I do not know their identity.\u201dIt was the truth.Cale, the original Kim Rok Soo, had read, \u2018The Birth of a Hero\u2019 until volume 5, but it did not mention anything about the secret organization\u2019s goals or identity. All it discussed was the actions of the organization.\u201cAnd one more thing. I am being completely honest when I say this.\u201dThe second of the two truths.\u201cI despise the organization and wish for it to disappear.\u201dNaturally, Cale was still alive. He did not like these people that caused such incidents. They probably take part in the continent\u2019s war as well. Cale wished for them to disappear so that he could live calmly on a peaceful continent.Choi Han seemed like he was at a loss for words. He looked at the black thread connecting himself, the priest, and Cale, before repeatedly clenching and unclenching his fist. Cale flinched at Choi Han\u2019s scary expression when Choi Han started to speak.\u201cHow can you hate them if you don\u2019t know them?\u201d\u201cBecause I know about a couple of the terrible things they plan on doing. The Black Dragon and Lock are two of them. Choi Han.\u201dCale pointed to himself with his index finger.\u201cI have lived my life as trash. That is my dream.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s expression changed after hearing Cale say that his dream was to be trash.\u201cI have no desire to become my family\u2019s successor. Basen Henituse, my blood-related younger brother. I am hoping for him to become the successor.\u201dThis was also the truth. That was why Cale asked Choi Han a question.\u201cSo then why would I have come to the capital as the representative of the Henituse family? Especially when I am hoping Basen becomes the successor? My father, the head of the household, told me to go, but I could have said no.\u201dChoi Han answered after a duration of silence.\u201c\u2026I am not sure.\u201d\u201cIt is because I know what the secret organization is planning to do in the capital.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s pupils dilated once more.\u201cI cannot answer how I know. But they are planning to kill a lot of people at the capital. I couldn\u2019t send Basen to such a place. I want to prevent that incident from happening.\u201dOf course, Cale was not planning to do anything and everything to put his own life on the line for others.\u201cAfter taking care of all of these issues as quietly as possible, I plan on returning to the Henituse territory.\u201d\u201c\u2026You cannot tell me how you know?\u201d\u201cCorrect. I cannot tell anybody, no matter who it is, about it.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s eyes were full of questions, but his mouth stayed shut.Cale didn\u2019t know the identity of the secret organization but he knew about a couple things they would end up doing. He also despised them and wanted them gone.Choi Han\u2019s head fell even more as he started to think things over. His head was a mess right now. Even still, the power of the God of Death coming through the black thread gave him serenity. He knew that Cale would die right here if he had lied.\u201cHowever, I will tell you one more thing.\u201dOne more. That made Choi Han quickly lift his head to look at Cale.\u201cThe last truth.\u201dThis was the third truth Cale told Choi Han.\u201cI have no desire to harm you.\u201dCale was confident as he said that. He remained alive, which meant this was the truth.Choi Han started to frown.Tap. Tap.Choi Han started to tap his thigh with his clenched fist. Although he was not tapping very hard, veins were popping out of his tightly clenched fist. He slowly raised his head. Cale was still alive.\u201c\u2026I trust you.\u201dListening to that response that took so long to come out, Cale repeated the words he had said to Choi Han before they entered this room.\u201cI understand.\u201dHe then started to smile.Sigh.Choi Han sighed while still sitting at the table. He lifted his head to look at Cale. Cale\u2019s eyes were pure as usual, while stubborn.\u201cCale-nim. Please promise one more thing. Then I will completely trust you.\u201d\u2018\u2026I didn\u2019t think something like this would happen.\u2019Cale was feeling iffy about Choi Han\u2019s response. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal because he would be able to find a way to twist anything to suit himself, but it was the phrase, \u2018completely trust you,\u2019 that was not sitting well with Cale. But it wasn\u2019t like he could say no right now.\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI must get revenge on that organization. I think this is the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever hated a person or an organization so much.\u201dAnger filled Choi Han\u2019s pure eyes. A sense of nostalgia could be seen behind the anger as well. Choi Han was probably thinking about Harris Village.\u2018Mm.\u2019Cale held back from letting that noise escape from his mouth. This was why he did not want Choi Han with him, even if Choi Han chose to follow him. Choi Han was a good person, but he would always finish something he made up his mind to do. That was why Cale waited for Choi Han\u2019s final request with nervousness.Choi Han finally started to speak.\u201cPlease tell me no matter what if you find out their identity.\u201d\u201cAh-, well, sure.\u201d\u2018I thought he was going to ask something difficult.\u2019Cale had a shocked expression as he made the vow.\u201cI, Cale Henituse, will inform Choi Han once I learn of their identity. I will pay with my life should I go against this vow. Good enough?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you very much.\u201dChoi Han finally started to smile. He seemed to be relieved. Cale started to think while observing this Choi Han.\u2018How would I ever learn of their identity?\u2019In order to find out their identity, actually, in order to even find the smallest clue about their identity, he would need to go down the same route Choi Han took in the novel. He would have to be crazy to do that. Once Choi Han gets out of the capital and the Roan Kingdom, he would run into all sorts of heroes; humans and non-humans alike.Just thinking about it made Cale feel terrible.\u201cThen are we done?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBang!Cale lifted his hand and slammed down on the table. His smash made the table slightly shake, and the priest opened his eyes and nodded his head. The area vibrated once more.Ooooooong-With that, the smoke disappeared into each of their bodies. It was slightly different from when Cale had experienced this with the crazy priestess Cage. Cale felt the two vows becoming ingrained into his body as he took a piece of paper out of his pocket.It was the cheque for 10 million gallons. Cale put that money in front of the calmly seated priest and got up. He then said goodbye to the priest before heading out of the room. Choi Han looked back and forth between the money and Cale, before following Cale out of the room and closing the door. He then looked toward Cale with confusion.Cale casually responded to Choi Han\u2019s gaze.\u201cNothing in life is free.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCale walked back up the stairs to find the priest from earlier standing at the entrance on the first floor.The priest greeted the still alive Cale.\u201cMay your life continue until its destined time.\u201dIt was their way of telling you not to break your vow so that you could continue to live. It was completely merciless.\u201cThank you very much, priest-nim.\u201dCale thanked the priest with a smile in response. The priest still found Cale\u2019s smile and relaxed voice to be odd, but Cale just walked past him to leave the temple.He then got on the carriage and and started to speak once the carriage started to move.\u201cFor your reference, that crazy mage, that person is the leader of the incident that will happen at the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Am I allowed to kill them if I see them?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me such an obvious question? Do as you want.\u201d\u2018Doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u2019However, that crazy mage was a highest level mage and a teleportation specialist, so Choi Han was never able to do a he wished in the novel.\u201cYes. I will make sure to kill them.\u201dCale turned away from the angry face of Choi Han. It was too vicious for Cale to handle.Once they got back to their residence, there was another individual Cale found difficult to handle.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cRon.\u201dThe assassin Ron, who had a benign smile on his face, came to look for Cale, who was trying to rest in his chamber.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t feel like drinking it, but he lifted the teacup up without saying anything else. He felt Ron\u2019s gaze on him as he took a sip of the lemon tea.It was then that Ron started to speak.\u201cYoung master, may I make a request?\u201d\u201cKek, what? A request?\u201dCale\u2019s eyes opened wide at Ron saying the word, \u2018request,\u2019 and turned to look at Ron quickly. Ron still had a gentle smile on his face. Cale\u2019s eyes started to fog up, as he quickly started to think.\u2018This devious old man has a request for someone like me, who he thinks is useless?\u2019Cale had an indescribable sense of ominousness. He felt like the man who tried to get rid of a lump on his face and ended up coming back with two. [1]\u00a0Either that, or the woodcutter who was greedy and claimed that both the golden axe and the silver axe were his and ended up leaving empty handed without even his own axe.\u00a0[2]Cale calmed himself before asking in a relaxed manner.\u201cAlright, what is it?\u201dRon immediately shared his request with Cale.\u201cMay I have two days off?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dCale subconsciously let out a gasp. He felt like he had his lump removed and received the set of golden and silver axes as a gift at the same time. [3]\u00a0Cale put the teacup down and grabbed Ron\u2019s hand, before starting to rapidly speak, unlike his usual style.\u201cYes. Good idea. Ron, you've worked so hard for tens of years. You had to take care of this trash of a young master. If you want a break, you can take off as long as you want. You are more than welcome to do that.\u201dYes, Cale would like it if Ron took a very long break. However, Ron needed to return before the capital terror incident in order to get connected to Choi Han, so two days was perfect. Cale was looking forward to enjoying the next two days without looking at this assassin\u2019s face.Ron looked toward Cale, who was holding his hand vigorously, with curiosity. However, Cale quickly turned his gaze away from Ron and opened a dresser next to the bed. Cale removed a money pouch out of the dresser and held it up.Cheques and large amounts of money were in the residence\u2019s safe, but there was still a lot of money in this bag as well. Cale took the whole bag and put it in Ron\u2019s hand. He was the son of a wealthy family, and really did not have anything else to give other than money.\u201cHere. This isn\u2019t much, but buy yourself some delicious food and enjoy your break.\u201dRon just blankly stared at the money pouch Cale had put in his hand.\u2018Buy myself delicious food and enjoy my break.\u2019This made Ron think about how long he had been living in hiding. He had spent that whole time taking care of this trash, this puppy young master.He was now trying to step back out of hiding and restart his life. But there was a good chance that his future would be chaotic. If those people really had crossed over to the Western Continent, it would actually be worse than just chaotic.\u2018Then I should leave my son here.\u2019Ron looked toward the relaxed young master in front of him.\u201cYoung master, will it really be okay?\u201dCale excitedly answered Ron\u2019s question. He wanted Ron to enjoy himself so much that he would desire to leave Cale for good.\u201cOf course. Ron, you are qualified to enjoy a break.\u201dQualification. Ron\u2019s original plan was to quietly leave in a few days either alone, or with Beacrox. However, this damn affection was the problem. That was why he mentioned a two day break. He wanted to see what this little punk would say. He was curious to know.This puppy young master of his now knew what kind of person he was because of Choi Han. Ron still had a gentle expression on his face, but his gaze started it turn cold.\u201cYoung master, this is too much money. What will you do if I take this and run away?\u201d\u2018Or is it that you want me to run away since you heard that I am a strong individual?\u2019Although the years of forcing himself to smile had created a lot of wrinkles on his face, his sharp gaze was directed to Cale. Ron could see Cale\u2019s reaction.Cale had snorted.\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know your personality, Ron? If you were going to run, you would have either left without saying anything or just flat out said that you were leaving. Am I wrong?\u201dThat was how Ron had left in the novel. He didn\u2019t say anything to the Count, and whenever he needed to separate from Choi Han\u2019s party for a bit, he would discuss their contract before leaving.\u201c... You are right. That is indeed correct.\u201dRon nodded his head with a smile on his face. Now that he thought about it, this puppy young master in front of him had seen him more than his own son, Beacrox, had for the last tens of years. In fact, Cale might be the person who knows the current Ron the best.\u2018I am very old now too.\u2019The old man accepted that he was getting older. Just like how tree rings don\u2019t grow all at once, the effects of time did not avoid him as well. He then started to speak.\u201cI will be back to serve you when you head to the royal palace.\u201d\u201cIf you really want to.\u201dRon looked toward the uninterested Cale and put the money pouch away.He couldn\u2019t allow Cale to go into the palace looking worse than the royal family or the other nobles. Ron did not want to see the puppy young master that he raised being looked down upon by others.That would be his last duty before he left.\u201cThen I will head out now.\u201d\u201cSure, sure.\u201dCale waved Ron out while sitting on his bed and had a wonderful night of sleep for the first time in a long time.By the time Cale woke up around lunch time the next day, Ron had already left early in the morning on his break. Thanks to that, deputy butler Hans became responsible for serving Cale.\u201cMr. Ron said he wasn\u2019t comfortable unless it was me. Haha, I guess I am kind of amazing?\u201d\u201cCan you just be quiet?\u201dCale ignored Hans and looked outside the open chamber door. Choi Han had been standing outside the door since early this morning. Cale was staring at Choi Han while wondering what was going on, and Choi Han answered without even needing to be asked.\u201cMr. Ron asked me to protect you.\u201d\u2018What was Ron thinking?\u2019Cale had a serious expression on his face as he received a cup from Hans. He then started to frown.\u201cHans. Why did you bring me lemonade?\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Young master, don\u2019t you like lemonade?\u201dSigh. Cale let out a deep sigh and drank the lemonade. It was better than cold water to wake him up and settle his stomach.Choi Han watched Hans and Cale from outside the chamber door as he recalled his conversation with Ron the night before.\u2018You\u2019re going somewhere?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018Where?\u2019\u2018Nothing a kid like you needs to know about.\u2019\u2018Did you come to talk to me for Cale-nim?\u2019\u2018You figure it out.\u2019That was what Ron said before leaving early this morning. Choi Han saw the assassin Ron instead of the servant Ron when Ron walked out of the residence.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dChoi Han snapped out of it as Cale called out to him. Cale had gotten up from the bed and was heading to the bathroom. Cale asked Choi Han, who was looking at him.\u201cIs Lock awake?\u2019\u201cYes sir.\u201dThe Wolf Tribe really did have fast regenerative abilities. Cale looked at the time. The piggy bank Billos, the bastard son of the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s leader, would soon arrive at the capital. Cale had promise to drink with him, and had already decided where they would meet. It was the same inn he had told Choi Han to stay in once he got to the capital. That inn also had a bar, which was famous for its alcohol.\u2018And something that will connect Choi Han and BIllos is there.\u2019Cale thought about the merchant who would be with the 10 wolf children right now and asked.\u201cWhat about the children and the merchant at the inn?\u201d\u201cI was thinking you could stop by on your way back from the meeting.\u201d\u201c...Meeting?\u201dHans approached the confused Cale and started to speak.\u201cYoung master, the invitation from the Northeastern nobles.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCale had forgotten about that because he did not consider those nobles to be very important. He started to frown a bit as he debated what to do. What kind of trash actions would he need to do at the meeting? Cale, Kim Rok Soo, had never met these people before, but it didn\u2019t matter. He was known as trash for a reason.\u201cAnd the guest wishes to speak with you as well.\u201d\u201cAre You talking about Miss Rosalyn?\u201d\u201cYes. She said any time will work based on your schedule.\u201dRosalyn was a smart girl. She probably already suspects that the feeling of mana from yesterday is from a dragon. She has probably never seen a dragon before, but such powerful mana could not come from anything other than a dragon.Cale opened the door to the bathroom and gave an order to Hans as he went in.\u201cI will eat breakfast in my room, so get it ready. After that, ask Miss Rosalyn if she would like to have breakfast together.\u201d\u201cYes, young master. I understand. However, it is the middle of the day, so it would be lunch.\u201d\u201c...Hans.\u201d\u201cI will get it ready right away!\u201dCale glared at Hans, who vigorously answered, and gave one last command before closing the bathroom door.\u201cAh, and leave the terrace door open.\u201d\u2018The Black Dragon needs to be able to come in.\u2019It was very odd that it could only sleep well if it slept outside on a tree by the window.* * *\u201cThen I will go bring Rosalyn-nim over now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCale sat on a chair by the food, that was breakfast for some and lunch for others and sent Hans out. Beacrox seemed to have put in quite the effort, as the food on the table looked fabulous. The table was full of food, probably because he asked for it all at once instead of in courses.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dChoi Han approached him.\u201cI will go stay with Lock while you are eating.\u201d\u201cI guess the two of you are taking turns nursing him.\u201dChoi Han started to smile in embarrassment at Cale\u2019s proclamation. Although Lock was quickly recovering, he was still laying on the bed with Rosalyn and Choi Han taking turns nursing him. Of course, Rosalyn was doing majority of the nursing.\u201cOn and Hong are helping to take care of him as well.\u201d\u201cLike hell they are.\u201dChoi Han could only remain silent at Cale\u2019s words. On and Hong were staying in Lock\u2019s room. But this was what the two kittens told Cale in secret before heading over.\u2018I think we are too weak to kill a Wolf Tribe. We will probably lose, even if we enter berserk mode. We need to figure out a way to squash people like him.\u2019\u2018Right, we need to figure out a way. That is why we will go study a bit.\u2019On and Hong were not there to nurse Lock but to determine how to kill such enemies in the future.\u201cBut Lock still seems relaxed having two cute kittens with him.\u201d\u201c...I guess that\u2019s great.\u201dCale had no desire to tell Choi Han and Lock the truth. Choi Han inspected the area to verify that the Black Dragon was not in the room before quietly speaking.\u201cI did not tell Lock or Rosalyn that I brought them with me because you told me to do so.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cI told you I would keep it a secret.\u201dChoi Han was showing a reliable side to Cale. Maybe it was because of yesterday\u2019s vow, but Choi Han did not know how devious words could be. He didn\u2019t know how words could be used to favor one party more than the other.The God of Death would only follow Cale\u2019s words and his interpretation of it because he was the one to put his life on the line.\u2018That is why nobles spent at least a week preparing what to say when they are going to make a Vow of Death. They usually average at least ten pages of texts to say.\u2019Cale thought about how he would use Choi Han in the future before starting to speak to Choi Han, who seemed to really trust him.\u201cChoi Han, did you say you were going to kill that blood drinking mage if you saw them again?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale nodded his head at the answer that came without any hesitation, and continued to speak.\u201cI will tell you how to find that person.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s gaze started to change. But Cale was not done just yet.\u201cOf course, we have to prevent the terror incident first.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s expression seemed to be asking Cale to tell him right away, but the moment he opened his mouth, there was a knock on the door followed by Hans\u2019s voice.Young master, I have brought Rosalyn-nim.\u201dCale nodded at Choi Han and got up from the chair. Choi Han silently got up as well and opened the door. Hans and Rosalyn entered through the open door. Hans did not enter any farther than the door frame, and calmly added on to what he stated previously.\u201cYoung master, Rosalyn-nim, please let me know if you need anything.\u201dHans then bowed and stepped out of the room. Choi Han followed behind him.\u201cRosalyn, I will be with Lock.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2019Once the two of them left, only Rosalyn and Cale were left in the room. Rosalyn looked to be calm, yet cold.\u201cThank you for the invitation, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing, Miss Rosalyn.\u201dCale pointed to the chair across from him and started to speak.\u201cThere are a lot of things we need to discuss.\u201d\u201cYoung master, I guess you don\u2019t like to beat around the bush?\u201dRosalyn started to smile as she asked, and Cale looked toward the open terrace window and started to speak.\u201cCome on in.\u201dIn that instant, Rosalyn quickly turned around. She could see some leaves floating into the room. She could not help but tremble.However, she was able to logically think things through last night. She had thought about it all night while nursing Lock. Three-layered magic and the ability to do such a thing. There was really just one answer.She moved her gaze from the leaves floating their way and looked toward Cale and asked.\u201cDragon. Is it a dragon-nim?\u201dMages really did respect dragons. Her demeanor clearly showed that was the case. Cale started to smirk, as he started to speak toward the floating leaves.\u201cYou introduce yourself.\u201dIn that instant, the leaves that were floating on top of the table, or over the steaks if you want to be really specific, turned into a Black Dragon. It had removed its invisibility magic.\u201cMm.\u201dRosalyn could not even gasp, as she was completely shocked. Even though she knew it was going to be a dragon, it still was shocking. There were less than 20 dragons in existence in both the Western and Eastern continents combined, but such an existence was in front of her right now.They were known for never leaving their territory and lair, and enjoying life as the most amazing existence in the world. Furthermore, dragons were the king of both mana and nature.They were also an existence that preferred solitude. Although it was confirmed that there were 20 dragons in the world, they were all different colors and varied drastically in personality, habits, and traits. The Magic Tower found this to be quite interesting. Why were they different in color and personality, even after growing up under their parents?There was only one explanation they could fathom.\u2018Dragons are prideful creatures that want to be different from any other.\u2019They want to be unique while they are alive. That was the case, even amongst their own tribe of dragons.Such an existence was in front of Rosalyn\u2019s eyes right now.It was a young dragon, but the mana she could feel and the unique gaze of a dragon told her it really was just like any other dragon.The Black Dragon quietly observed Rosalyn for a bit before turning its head away. Rosalyn did not know what to say about the dragon\u2019s action. After doing that, the dragon moved in front of the steak and started to speak.\u201cI am hungry.\u201d\u201c...Go ahead, you can eat it.\u201dCale shook his head as he answered, and also offered Rosalyn a seat.\u201cWe should eat as well.\u201d\u201cAh \u2026 yes.\u201dRosalyn had a blank expression on her face as she sat down. She could see the young Black Dragon eating the steak in front of her, while Cale, who was dressed fancier than usual because he needed to attend the Northeastern Nobles meeting, was elegantly eating a soup.Nobody at the Magic Tower would believe her if she told them about this.However, Rosalyn believed in what she was seeing in front of her eyes, as well as the rest of her five senses. Everything in nature could be felt by the five senses.\u201c...It is so amazing that a mage like myself can see such a sight. A dragon is with a human.\u201dRosalyn believed in the sight in front of her and revealed her honest observation. Cale did not care to respond, but the Black Dragon stopped eating the steak to look at Rosalyn. He then turned his head to look at Cale.It was the face of a reptile, but its expression was clearly visible. The Black Dragon started to frown while looking at Cale, who was still eating his soup, and started to speak.\u201cVery weak. He is no better than an ant. That is the reason.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dBoth Cale and the dragon agreed. Rosalyn watched this with curiosity, before eventually nodding her head.\u201cA meal with young master Cale and Dragon-nim. It is an honor.\u201dRosalyn was calm as she elegantly lifted up her fork. Cale observed her expression, as he continued to eat his soup.\u2018She really is a courageous person.\u2019Any other mage would be shaking non-stop and praising the dragon right now. They would then ask the dragon to teach them even a little bit about mana or magic. A dragon\u2019s magic was something that would make any mage on the continent go crazy.Cale started to speak to Rosalyn, who was starting off with a salad.\u201cPlease feel free to stay here as long as you like.\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI have three things I am curious about. But one of them has already been resolved, so I have two more. May I ask about them?\u201d\u201cPlease do.\u201dThe first was probably about the dragon. Cale had decided to reveal the dragon\u2019s existence to Rosalyn after contemplating it for a long time. He felt like it would be more beneficial to him that way.He felt like he could anticipate the other two questions as well.\u201cHere is the second thing I am curious about.\u201dRosalyn asked her question calmly and sincerely.\u201cIs it okay to allow someone who was not invited to stay in your residence like this? Even if I am a mage, as a noble, you must be sensitive about associating with strangers.\u201dCale easily answered that question.\u201cIt is fine because you are someone Choi Han brought.\u201dCale peeked at the Black Dragon, that was eating the steak, before looking back toward Rosalyn and continuing to speak.\u201cI also have this guy.\u201dThe Black Dragon did not respond to that statement. However, he flicked his wing once before stuffing his face into the steak plate and starting to devour the steak even faster than before. Rosalyn watched the dragon for a long time, before her red pupils moved back to Cale, who was eating a salmon steak.\u201c... I see. Then here is my third question.\u201dCale stopped eating the salmon steak and looked up at Rosalyn. Their eyes met, and Cale could see her red pupils. Originally, Rosalyn changed her pupils from red to black with magic when they entered the capital. She did the same thing with her hair color. However, that was not the case right now.Rosalyn asked her question.\u201cWhy do you speak so respectfully to me, despite your status as a noble?\u201dCale lifted up the wine glass next to the salmon steak and took a sip of the white wine. He then started to speak.\u201cRed hair, red pupils, and a mage. Then there is your self-revealed name of Rosalyn.\u201dIt was weird to pretend not to know when someone was being so clear about it.Cale started to smile as he asked.\u201cPrincess-nim, aren\u2019t you the one who should stop speaking so respectfully to me?\u201d1.

    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35: Being Still (2)Rosalyn started to smile.\u201cI heard you were trash, but I guess that was a lie.\u201dRosalyn stopped with the respectful tone almost immediately, as Cale had expected. Although the majority of the people may not know what the princess of another kingdom may look like, it was different for nobles.Low-level nobles may have found it difficult to gather information, but at the Count level, like the Henituse family, having information about the neighboring kingdoms\u2019 nobles and royalty was basic knowledge. It was not just fun and games to be a noble.Cale responded to Rosalyn\u2019s statement.\u201cIt is true that I am famous for being trash. However, a mage should make their judgments based on their five senses.\u201d\u201cYou are right, young master Cale. We only believe the things we experience ourselves.\u201dCale thought Rosalyn\u2019s way of speaking was quite odd. She was speaking informally to him as a princess, but when she was referring to herself as part of the society of mages by using the term, \u2018we,\u2019 she spoke formally. Her identity as a mage seemed to be very important to her.\u201cBut princess-nim.\u201d\u201cRosalyn.\u201dShe really didn\u2019t seem to like being treated like a princess.\u201cOkay then. Miss Rosalyn, are you done with your questions?\u201d\u201cYes. I am finished.\u201dShe smiled as she answered.\u201cYoung master Cale, it seems like you do not want to be involved with me?\u201dEven though he knew she was a princess, he just told her to enjoy her stay and then leave. It wasn\u2019t that she found that to be disrespectful or anything. In fact, she preferred it that way. If she wanted special treatment, she would have revealed her full name and her identity immediately.She did not want to be treated that way however. In addition, she was thankful to Cale for telling them about Lock\u2019s condition.\u201cReally? I just acted that way since princess-nim seemed to prefer it this way.\u201d\u2018Liar.\u2019Rosalyn treated Cale\u2019s words as just a good excuse.A human who travels with a dragon. He was known to be trash by society, but was not actually like that in reality. He could have easily revealed her existence if he really wanted to do so.She thanked Cale, who was smiling as if he knew nothing.\u201cIt seems like you have not informed the Roan royalty. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cNo problem. Something like that should be based on the involved individual\u2019s own wishes.\u201dCale thought that the crown prince would barge into this residence if Cale had reported it to the palace.\u201cYou are correct, young master Cale. I do not wish to reveal myself. If this lands you into trouble in the future, please let them know that I asked you not to do so. I will send a messenger to back up your story.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cThank you for letting me stay here. I will take care of my business and not cause you any trouble.\u201d\u2018Not cause me any trouble.\u2019Cale thanked Rosalyn, who was giving him the answer he wanted to hear the most.\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cNo worries, it is how it should be.\u201dRosalyn brushed Cale\u2019s thanks off before continuing to eat. Cale and Rosalyn, the two of them did not need to speak anymore. Rosalyn just peeked at the dragon every so often.She couldn\u2019t help it. As a mage, her gaze continued to head to the dragon. The dragon stopped eating the sausage that originally was for Cale before turning to look at Rosalyn. After ignoring Rosalyn\u2019s continued peeking for a while, he finally spoke up.\u201cEat your own food. This is mine.\u201dThe Black Dragon pulled the plate with the sausage closer to him. Cale was casually piling more food onto that plate for the dragon. The Black Dragon was getting addicted to the taste of steak, which was different from eating raw meat, as well as the other types of various foods that were on the table.Rosalyn peeked toward Cale, and Cale stealthily put up four fingers without the dragon noticing. Four years old. Rosalyn smiled at the meaning of Cale\u2019s message, and responded to the dragon.\u201cYes, dragon-nim. I would not dare eye your food.\u201dThe Black Dragon started to eat again and Rosalyn and Cale continued their meals as well.It was a relaxing and peaceful meal.After it was over, Cale got on the carriage to go meet the Northeastern nobles. The Northeastern nobles consisted of just 10 noble families. There were more if you considered the barons and below, but the pillar of the Northeast was based on these 10 families. Of those 10 families, the three people Cale was meeting today came from three families that had been friendly with the Henituse family for a long time.\u201cWhat a dilemma.\u201dThat was why Cale was worried. Choi Han, who had been following him as a guard, cautiously asked.\u201cWhat is? If I can do anything to help, please let me know.\u201d\u201cNothing. You don\u2019t need to know.\u201dCale just curtly answered before starting to think again. Choi Han observed Cale and started to worry as well. It was the first time Choi Han had seen Cale worrying like this.Cale did not know what to do.Just what kind of chaos would he need to cause to really look like trash?Cale had come to a realization after being stuck with large baggage like Choi Han and the Black Dragon. He was having a dilemma about how to live a trash life.The Northeastern nobles would have seen Cale\u2019s trash behavior in the past. They would have also received news about all of Cale\u2019s trashy actions in the Henituse territory. That was why he had to be even more careful, no, he had to be even more chaotic.\u201cHmm.\u201dCale looked down at his two hands. Act like a total bastard? That would be a way to seem like the trash of all trash. While Cale was thinking about what he could do to act terribly, the carriage stopped in front of a residence. Since the Northeastern nobles all had residences in the same area of the capital, it was not very far.\u201cWelcome, young master Cale-nim.\u201dCale noticed the old butler greeting him at the gate, and looked to the building behind the butler.This was Count Wheelsman\u2019s residence. Count Wheelsman\u2019s territory was located in the beginning parts of the Northeast, and he was neither very strong nor very wealthy. That was why he was able to build a close relationship with Count Henituse in the Northeast, where they did not have any dukes or marquis. Count Henituse liked this friendship because, for someone like him, whose territory was far in the corner of the Northeast, knowing someone who was the close to the capital was beneficial.Cale thought about Count Wheelsman\u2019s successor.\u2018Eric Wheelsman.\u2019Deputy butler Hans had cautiously advised Cale before he left for this meeting.\u2018Young master, it is great that you have a good relationship with young master Eric, but I bring this up to you to ask whether you think it would be smarter to not act so close to each other in front of the other nobles in the meeting.\u2019That let Cale know that Eric and the original owner of this body were very close. However, the information about Eric in the nobles information report described Eric as a good person who was a bit uptight.\u201cYoung master Cale, may I escort you inside?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dCale followed the old butler into the Wheelsman residence.Eric Wheelsman, Gilbert Chetter, and Amiru Ubarr. The three of them were inside the residence. Cale was still thinking about how he should act in front of them as he entered inside.In the end, he didn\u2019t need to worry about such a thing.\u201cCale. You at least still listened to this hyung. Right?\u201dCale had a confused look on his face. Eric Wheelsman pushed up his glasses after seeing Cale\u2019s expression. Right now, Cale was seated at the table with the three nobles surrounding him like he was in an interview.\u2018This is odd.\u2019But the atmosphere was more of them consoling him rather than interviewing him. Eric Wheelsman started to speak.\u201cWon\u2019t it be annoying for you as well?\u201dViscount Ubarr\u2019s daughter Amiru and Baron Chetter\u2019s son Gilbert chimed in.\u201cHe\u2019s right. Young master Cale, I heard you don\u2019t like annoying formalities.\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, it is not wrong to find something to be annoying.\u201dIt felt like they were trying to console a child. Cale first responded to their statements.\u201cYes, it is annoying.\u201d\u201cSee! That is why!\u201dTap.Eric lightly tapped the table. It did not seem like it was because he was angry, but more like a subconscious movement.He looked toward Cale, who used to be a cute little kid until he grew up to be trash, and quietly continued.\u201cThat is why you don\u2019t need to say anything or do anything. Just be still! Be still and we will take care of everything for you. You hate annoying things and formalities anyway.\u201dCale responded back with an intrigued expression.\u201cI am very good at staying still.\u201d\u201cHuh? You are? Ah, yes. You are like that. You are very good at that.\u201dEric was known for being uptight, but he was also the type to worry about everything. But that was only because he liked to think about everything before they actually happened.He started to speak to Cale, who became the biggest concern of his since yesterday, when he found out that Cale really was the one to come to the capital. The other two looked toward Eric as if they were cheering him on.\u201cSome of the other Northeastern nobles may try to annoy you. The ones who aligned themselves with Marquis Stan or some other duke will definitely try. But all you have to do is be still and we will take care of everything for you. What do you think?\u201dThis was what Eric was most worried about. Of the 10 pillar families, only these 4 families have not aligned themselves elsewhere. The other nobles who aligned with higher ranking nobles from outside the area would want to offer the entire Northeastern group of nobles to their upline.They needed to be cautious, cautious, and even more cautious. This group of four families had to be in the center. That was their way of being the strongest faction in the Northeast, and, in order to do that, the wealthy Henituse family could not cause an accident at the capital.Eric, as well as the other two, quietly waited for Cale\u2019s response.\u201cThat would be great.\u201dCale had a gentle smile on his face to go with his response. Eric was thinking that Cale still looked like the good kid from the past, as long as he was not drinking, and started to speak.\u201cI plan on showing our respect to the crown prince together as well. I\u2019m sure you find this to be annoying and want to get right to drinking, but that will be difficult. As long as you do that initial greeting, we will take care of EVERYTHING ELSE!\u201d\u2018Oh?\u2019Cale started to smirk. He found this atmosphere quite interesting. He picked up the wineglass in front of him. Cale could see Gilbert flinch as he did that.Cale thought this was odd as well. He may be a troublesome trash, but since they were on the same side, their only possible course of action was to protect him. He wet his mouth with the wine, before starting to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201dEric had a bright smile on his face as his glasses reflected the light from the chandelier.Cale decided to take the three nobles\u2019 offer of doing nothing and getting their protection. He liked this plan very much.\u201cAll you have to do is show up, sit there, and relax.\u201d\u201cGreat. It sounds perfect.\u201dIt was a very good offer, just the type Cale liked. He calmly ate the meal in front of him, as he started to think that it was a good idea to come here today. However, Eric, Gilbert, and Amiru did not let their guards down. Cale Henituse was someone who had even thrown a bottle at the Northeastern nobles meeting when everything seemed to be going great.They were especially cautious because they were here to convince the crown prince to invest in the Northeastern coastline, where Gilbert and Amiru\u2019s families were positioned.\u201cWine from the Henituse territory really is great.\u201dOf course, Cale knew about the two family\u2019s desire for the crown prince\u2019s investment from the information Hans had given to him. The four families shared information with each other without any secrets. However, Cale knew that the investment from the crown prince would not be possible.\u2018How would he be able to invest when a war will soon start from the south of the Western Continent? It might be different if it was a navy though.\u2019The four nobles chatted every so often as they continued their meal. The three nobles relaxed a bit after seeing Cale make it through the whole meal without causing an accident.They were all decently satisfied with this meeting.* * *Cale rested for a bit after returning to his residence, before hearing that Choi Han was back, causing Cale to call him to his room.\u201cCale-nim, you called for me?\u201d\u201cThe inn?\u201d\u201cFine. Thankfully, the children are energetic.\u201dCale turned pale after thinking about 10 energetic Wolf Tribe children. On the other hand, Choi Han seemed to be more relaxed and happier.\u201cThen there is nothing else to do?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dCale nodded his head before standing up. It was only then that Choi Han realized that Cale was not wearing his pajamas nor his usual outfit. He was wearing very casual clothes.Cale walked over to his bed as he started to speak.\u201cI will be laying in bed, so go tell Hans he can stop standing outside the door and can go sleep. He will go without even looking back.\u201dChoi Han looked out the open terrace window. It was a bright night. He then asked Cale.\u201cWill you be heading out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale smiled as he answered.\u201cI left the terrace open like before, so come to my room.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s gaze changed. He remembered what Cale had told him the other day. Cale mentioned that he would tell Choi Han how to find that blood drinking mage.\u201cWill it just be the two of us, without either On or Hong?\u201dChoi Han asked with a serious expression, but an answer came from somewhere else.\u201cI will be going as well.\u201dThe Black Dragon removed its invisibility magic and entered through the terrace window. Choi Han looked toward the Black Dragon before turning back to look at Cale. Cale answered even more relaxed than ever before.\u201cThe three of us will go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Oh, and wear a hat.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dChoi Han left only the night stand\u2019s light on and turned the rest of the lights off before heading out of the room and saying something to Hans. Cale kept his eyes closed and pretended to be asleep.The door soon closed and Hans did not enter. The Black Dragon, who had been invisible while the door was open, removed its invisibility and landed on the bed. One side of the bed started to sink while the dragon started to speak in a worried voice.\u201cYou cannot really fall asleep.\u201dCale started to think after hearing the dragon\u2019s words.\u2018Do I look like a four-year-old to this dragon?\u2019Cale let out a sigh and got up from the bed. A few moments later, Choi Han reentered the room through the window while wearing a robe.\u201cYou\u2019re here. I guess a robe is definitely better than a hat.\u201dChoi Han nodded and started to speak toward the dragon as Cale packed a hat.\u201cWill you be following us like that?\u201d\u201cI will be invisible.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I heard that dragons could polymorph. Can\u2019t you turn into a human? I think that would be easier.\u201dA dragon\u2019s magic was an expression of their will. That was why Choi Han thought that the dragon could easily polymorph if it had the will to do so.The Black Dragon snorted at Choi Han\u2019s words.\u201cI hate humans. I do not want to be like the humans. He said that dragons were cool and awesome.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201dThe Black Dragon peeked toward Cale at Choi Han\u2019s question, before quickly looking away. It then turned invisible and flew up into the sky. The sunken part of the bed returned back to normal.Cale leisurely started to speak to Choi Han, who was looking at him with an odd expression.\u201cDragons indeed are cool.\u201d\u201cThey really are.\u201dChoi Han nodded his head and followed behind Cale, who was heading toward the terrace. He then looked out the third-floor terrace window and stopped suddenly.\u201cUm, Cale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do I have to carry you again?\u201dCale snorted at Choi Han\u2019s hesitant question, and pointed to the ceiling with his index finger. At that moment, Cale\u2019s body slowly lifted off the floor and started to turn invisible.Cale watched his entire body turn invisible before looking up to the ceiling and starting to speak.\u201cDragons are great and mighty.\u201d\u201cYou are right. I am great and mighty.\u201dThe invisible Black Dragon responded to Cale. Choi Han could see Cale\u2019s evil smirk quickly appear before disappearing. Choi Han realized how Cale was controlling the dragon and he started to speak as well.\u201cWow, dragons are great and mighty.\u201dOnce Choi Han said that, he turned invisible as well, and they could leave the residence without any worries. Of course, there were magic detection tools around the residence fence, but they were for preventing intruders. They did not have any reaction to people leaving from the residence.Choi Han stood at a small alley a bit away from the residence, and started to speak.\u201cIt is fine from here.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the invisibility magic on Cale and Choi Han was removed. Cale, whose levitation magic was removed as well, landed gently from the 10 centimeters he was floating in the air. Cale was shocked at this chain of events.\u2018The Black Dragon\u2019s magic skills are much stronger than I thought. I wonder if it is related to its special characteristics.\u2019This level of magic was already a bit higher than the level of the highest tier mages. It was no wonder that they said that an adult dragon could easily destroy an entire kingdom if it was willing to do so.\u2018But I won\u2019t need his help like this once I get the Sound of the Wind. I can then move around without the Black Dragon or Choi Han coming with me.\u2019The Sound of the Wind was the third ancient power Cale was planning on taking. However, he needed to head to the Roan Kingdom\u2019s Northeastern shores to find that power.\u2018I\u2019ll need to go to young lady Amiru\u2019s territory.\u2019Cale was planning on heading there to get the Sound of the Wind on his way back from the capital. His excuse to others would be that he wanted to go sightseeing, since he was already out. The fact that it was an ancient power by the sea made him a bit concerned, but Cale decided to not think much about it because it was a power that he could quietly take.\u2018By then, Choi Han\u2019s crew won\u2019t be with me anyways.\u2019Cale was certain that the Whale Tribe and the mermaids appeared at the Northeastern shores around the end of volume 4. The war in the ocean between the Eastern and Western continents. All he had to do was avoid the shores at that time. More than the whales, he needed to avoid those crazy mermaids.Cale covered his red hair with his hat, before taking a map out of his pocket. He then took the lead.\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe still invisible Black Dragon and Choi Han walked on either side of Cale, following Cale out of the southern district of the nobles and into the center of Huiss.The night became as bright as the day as they got closer to the center of Huiss. There were many bright lights on the streets with shops selling stuff, and bars were the most lively at this time.\u201cThe nightlife at the capital is really different from other places.\u201d\u201cIt sure is.\u201dCale nodded his head at Choi Han\u2019s words before heading toward the Plaza of Glory at the center of Huiss. They could see a round plaza in front of them with fountains in all four directions. Each fountain had groups of citizens gathered around it.The three of them could see the citizens relaxing with their families or friends after a long day of work. Since it was 9 pm right now, they would continue to enjoy themselves at the plaza until the guards came to patrol at 11 pm.Cale looked to the left. Choi Han was blankly watching some families laughing together at the fountain to the east.Cale, who had been leisurely watching Choi Han and the scene in front of them, started to speak.\u201cMake it so nobody can hear us.\u201dOnce he said that, an invisible dome appeared around them. It was something that only Cale, Choi Han, and the Black Dragon, who were inside the dome, could see.Choi Han finally turned to look at Cale.\u201cThere is this thing called a magic bomb.\u201d\u201cA bomb?\u201d\u201cYes. A bomb. Magic bombs can come in many shapes and sizes. With this Western continent having a long history of war that was led by magic, it has developed quite a bit.\u201dChoi Han quietly listened to Cale\u2019s story.\u201cHowever, there are a lot of restrictions. The location of the magic bomb, controlling the mana flowing through it, and many other factors cause these bombs to be really complicated to use.\u201dThat was why they preferred to have a mage use their magic during war rather than using magic bombs. But the magic bombs this time are different from those used previously.\u201d\u201cOf those bombs, newly developed magic bombs will go off here, as well as multiple places around here, in six days.\u201dCale did not think that the five bombs Choi Han and Rosalyn had found in the novel would still be the same. The story had already changed. That meant that this situation could easily change as well. That was why Cale came up with a new plan.However, he was still certain that the magic bomb terror incident would still proceed as described.\u2018Since I was able to confirm that the crazy mage was in this kingdom.\u2019The crazy mage was the one who created this new magic bomb. The secret organization would eventually distribute this bomb to different territories in the Roan Kingdom after the incident at the capital. Of course, they will be hiding their identity as the secret organization.\u201cAre you saying a bomb will go off here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChoi Han looked around at the fountains and the people in the plaza. A cold voice filled his ear at that time.\u201cIt could be buried somewhere or even installed on a person. Of course, that person will not know it is a bomb and think it is something else, like a bracelet or a purse and have it on them.\u201dOn a person. That phrase made Choi Han turn his head to look at Cale. Cale responded coldly to Choi Han.\u201cThat is why we need to prevent it.\u201dOf course, Cale would not do it. Choi Han, Rosalyn, and the Black Dragon will be the ones to take care of it. Cale planned to be still. Cale planned to be very still at the capital.\u201cHow can we prevent it?\u201d\u201cSimple.\u201dCale crossed his arms as he leaned on a tree in the plaza and continued to speak.\u201cMagic bombs, are in essence, chunks of mana. That is why all you need to do is have someone with high mana sensitivity inspect the area and search any locations that seem to have an abundance of mana.\u201dChoi Han flinched at Cale\u2019s calm demeanor before cautiously asking.\u201cIs it so much higher that it will be that easily detected?\u201d\u201cNo. It is just slightly higher, making it difficult for any average mage to notice it. But that small chunk of mana can instantly pull in the mana in the surrounding area to create a large explosion.\u201dChoi Han looked concerned. As a sword user and an aura user, he was slightly sensitive to mana as well. However, he was not as sensitive to it as mages, and could not be of help.\u201cCale-nim, I do not think it will be easy.\u201d\u201cIt is very easy.\u201dCale answered that way as he asked.\u201cRight?\u201dAt that moment, an answer came from above.\u201cIt is doable. Just annoying.\u201dNext to Cale was the Black Dragon, an existence that was said to be the most sensitive to mana. Choi Han quickly understood and nodded his head. He had forgotten that this dragon was a great and mighty existence.Cale handed the map in his hand to Choi Han.\u201cI don\u2019t know about the people, but the bombs installed in locations will be installed at least two days before the incident.\u201dThe day of the incident would be when the king arrives. That meant that the security would be multiple times the normal level starting from the day before. That's why they needed to install the bombs at least two days before.\u201cI don\u2019t know about the other locations, but I am certain that at least one bomb will be near this plaza. This is the place with the most people.\u201d\u201cRight. I agree.\u201d\u201cThat is why, with this plaza as the center point.\u201dCale pointed toward Choi Han and then up to the sky.\u201cChoi Han, you and the dragon will roam around the capital every night to look for the magic bombs.\u201d\u201cThe two of us?\u201dCale patted Choi Han\u2019s shoulder and answered as Choi Han asked. The way to handle the Black Dragon and Choi Han was pretty similar.\u201cYes. Choi Han, if it is you, I know that you can stealthily move around without being noticed. You are very talented.\u201dChoi Han quietly nodded his head with a serious expression. He then asked.\u201cWhat should we do once we find it?\u201d\u201cLeave it there for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Not get rid of it?\u201d\u201cWe will get rid of it on the day of the incident.\u201d\u201cMay I ask why?\u201dCale started to smirk.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to find that mage?\u201dIt was not the answer to Choi Han\u2019s question, but Choi Han first nodded his head. Cale looked around the plaza. Everybody looked happy, but members of the secret organization may be mixed in with them. Cale did not know where that blood-drinking mage was located. The mage may be hiding somewhere or roaming around under a disguise.\u201cA mage needs to be present in order to make a magic bomb go off. The mage who made the bomb needs to remove the restriction to set it off.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then-\u201dChoi Han started to speak as a thought came to him before stopping himself and looking back toward Cale. Cale continued on in an uninterested voice.\u201cFirst, find the bombs. If you happen to get lucky and find the people installing the bombs, follow them without getting noticed.\u201dSince the Black Dragon will be with him, Choi Han would stop right before he would be detected by magic. But Cale thought it would be difficult for them to find those people in the process.It will take a lot of work to look for the locations with a slightly elevated mana fluctuation to find the bombs. It will be very difficult and tiring. That was why Cale left this task to the two of them. He would not be able to help, but, more importantly, he didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201cThen do we just have to roam around until two days before the event?\u201d\u201cNo. The two of you will need to come the day before as well.\u201d\u201cThe day before?\u201d\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be difficult because there will be a lot more guards?\u2019Choi Han did not ask his question. It would be difficult, but still manageable for him. He would just need to spend a little more effort and be a little more cautious.At that moment, Choi Han could see Cale with his villainous smirk once again.Cale took a black orb out of his pocket and showed it to Choi Han.\u201cAh.\u201dChoi Han let out a gasp. He was familiar with this black orb. It was the Mana Disturbance Tool. It had been used by Cale once before. It was strong enough to have a range of an entire mountain.Cale leisurely smiled as he started to speak. He knew when the bomb would go off.\u201cA lot of mages will be there that day, so it probably won\u2019t even last 10 minutes, but it will help. It will make everything related to magic not work for that duration.\u201d10 minutes was enough.They just needed to save the people with bombs on them in those 10 minutes. They will be very visible. And, by that point, there will be a lot of humans and beast people to put to work, in addition to Choi Han and the dragon as well.Choi Han looked back and forth between the black orb and Cale, before taking a gulp and starting to speak.\u201c\u2026Cale-nim, you were planning to do all of this on your own-\u201d\u201cThat is why.\u201dCale knew what Choi Han was going to say. That was why he cut him off and started to speak to Choi Han and the dragon.\u201cGo and work.\u201dChoi Han blankly stared at Cale. Cale pointed to the beer bar that was famous for its beer and continued on.\u201cI will be waiting for you here. Just look around until about 11 before coming back for today.\u201dChoi Han thought for a moment, before letting out a sigh-like laughter and nodding his head.\u201cGot it. Today, the dragon and I will just look around the interior of the plaza before returning.\u201dChoi Han had originally thought about asking why Cale was not going with them. However, he quickly realized it. Cale would only be baggage to Choi Han and the Black Dragon as they worked.Cale was weak. There was not even a trace of mana coming from Cale\u2019s body, nor did he look like he practiced any type of martial arts. He was plain, yet not plain at the same time.\u201cI will work hard, so please buy me a beer when I come back.\u201d\u201cSure. Dragon, thanks for your help too.\u201dThe Black Dragon got rid of the soundproof dome, as if to respond to Cale\u2019s words. Choi Han just slightly bowed his head before moving away from Cale.Two hours later, Cale returned to the residence with Choi Han and the Black Dragon, who did not manage to find anything.They did not manage to find anything the next night either.Cale, who could not sleep at night, finally woke up in the middle of the day. He was not tired though, because the Vitality of the Heart made it difficult for Cale to feel tired.\u201cYoung master, are you up?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ron.\u201dCale\u2019s honey-like slumber disappeared like a dream, as he came back to reality.\u201cI have returned.\u201dRon was back. He then handed a letter to Cale. Cale gave an order to Ron for the first time in a while after seeing the letter.\u201cRon, go wrap up a bottle of the best wine.\u201dIt was a letter with the crest of the Flynn Merchant Guild. Cale opened the letter to find a single sentence.[Young master Cale, will you be treating me to alcohol soon?]The bastard son of the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s leader, Billos, would soon arrive at the capital.The letter helped Cale realize that it would not be long before he met the crown prince inside the palace. Since there were a lot of villains in there, it was time for him to be very, very still.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By the way, young master, you do remember that you have to visit the palace the day after tomorrow, right?\u201dBefore the king announces the start of the festival in the plaza, the nobles were scheduled to meet with the crown prince. It was neither a serious meeting nor a feast, but something in between. It was set to take place in a wing of the palace where important meetings usually took place.Cale thought about the crown prince and the palace before his mind drifted elsewhere.\u2018I wonder if Taylor and Cage are well.\u2019The fallen eldest son and the crazy priestess. Cale thought that the two of them were probably doing very well.\u201cMm.\u201dBut suddenly, his back felt chilly and he caressed the back of his head. That coldness made Cale make up his mind.\u2018Let\u2019s not think about the two of them.\u2019Cale will be very still at the palace. Even if someone curses him from the side, he will just sit there silently before returning here. Cale peeked at the table in front of them. There was a letter from Eric sitting there.[Cale. You don\u2019t have to do anything, anything at all. This hyung-nim will take care of it all for you. Got it? \u2026]Eric Wheelsman, one of the Northeastern nobles, sent him a letter a day. It was very clear that Eric was worried about what might happen. Cale grabbed the letter on the table and chucked it to a corner.\u201cThen I will make sure to have them wrap up a bottle of our best alcohol.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dCale was watching Ron leave, when he saw some faces he had not seen for a while enter through the open door. Ron peeked at the two of them before closing the door. The two that entered approached Cale and started to speak.\u201cI think I can kill them if they let their guard down!\u201d\u201cI see a way we can kill them!\u201dIt was the kittens On and Hong. These two kittens, who Cale had not seen for a while, were excited, as they seemed to have found a way to kill the Beast people who were as strong as the Wolf Tribe.\u201cGood job.\u201dThe two kittens came and rubbed their faces on Cale\u2019s leg after hearing his compliment toward them. Cale pushed the two of them away because he found it annoying. Ron soon entered the room once again.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRon looked at Cale, who answered like he didn\u2019t care, before asking his question.\u201cMay I go as your personal servant to the palace?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking such an obvious question? Who would go if it wasn\u2019t you?\u201dThat answer made Ron make up his mind to leave.The people who called themselves, \u2018Arm,\u2019 and ruled the Eastern continent\u2019s underworld had started to expand their reach to the Western continent. \u2018Arm,\u2019 was just one limb of the organization, and nobody knew their true identity.The Molan family was a fifth generation assassin household that sought to rule the night in the Eastern Continent, and Ron Molan, the successor to the Molan family, hated and feared this, \u2018Arm.\u2019\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou will be very cool in the palace.\u201d\u201cRon.\u201dCale looked toward Ron, who, after returning from his time off, was flattering him unlike his usual self, and casually asked.\u201cI do have a handsome face and figure don\u2019t I?\u201dMeeeeeow.The kittens snorted at Cale, but they couldn\u2019t disagree. Cale was a handsome man with a slick figure.Kim Rok Soo\u2019s favorite thing about Cale was his money, but right after that was Cale\u2019s body and face. Cale\u2019s lips looked like they wanted to form a smile.\u201cOf course. Our young master is the full package.\u201dBut that smile quickly disappeared.\u2018What did I just hear right now?\u2019It was a very gentle, warm, and caring voice. It even sounded like Ron was playing along with him. Cale felt chills all over his body, and turned his head around to see Ron standing there with a satisfied smile on his face. It looked different from when he was pretending to be satisfied.Cale really felt chills all over his body now. But Ron did not care and continued to go on with his duties.\u201cThen I will head out for now. I need to go report to deputy butler Hans.\u201d\u201cOh? Oh. Go ahead, quickly.\u201dRon soon left, and Cale started to ponder while looking at the closed door.\u2018Why is he acting like this?\u2019But Cale did not want to find out the reason. What good would come from being interested in Ron\u2019s life? Cale stared at that closed door for a long time, before a confused expression filled his face.Knock knock knock.Someone was knocking on the door. The red kitten Hong started to speak.\u201cSmells like a wolf.\u201dCale looked toward the door and started to speak.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door clicked and slowly started to open. Cale could see the wolf boy, Lock, awkwardly standing there. Lock hesitated for a bit, before starting to speak.\u201cHello, I, I came to thank you. I didn\u2019t know when would be a good time to stop by, so, if it is okay with you, may I come in for a bit?\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dCale didn\u2019t want to hear this awkward voice any longer, so he waved Lock inside. Lock carefully closed the door with a nervous expression, and approached Cale. Cale pointed to the couch across from him.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLock sat down on the couch and peeked at Cale. Unlike his earlier words that made Lock think of his uncle, this person, named Cale Henituse, had an aura about him that made it difficult to approach him.Rather than it being difficult because he was strong like his uncle, it just felt like it would be difficult to talk to Cale.\u201cSay what is on your mind.\u201d\u201cYou see.\u201dLock seemed to be thinking about what to say, before jumping up from the seat and bowing toward Cale.\u201cThank you very much!\u201dLock seemed very naive, scared, and, in some aspects, stupid. He definitely fit the profile described in the novel.\u2018His personality changed in the novel after going berserk for the first time, but it looks like it is still the same now.\u2019Cale responded to Lock\u2019s thank you.\u201cSure. It is definitely something to be thankful for.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Ah, yes.\u201dLock had an odd expression on his face as he sat back down. Cale watched Lock sit and started to speak.\u201cNo need to thank me anymore, you can go.\u201d\u201cAh, well, actually.\u201dLock could not stand back up, and just moved his lips without saying anything. He had heard stories from Rosalyn, the two Cat tribe kittens, Choi Han, and even Hans, which made him think things through over and over. He was still not done thinking things through.Cale just quietly watched Lock. It was because he knew how Lock would act that he was trying to quickly kick Lock out of here.\u201cWell, young master, you see.\u201dLock didn\u2019t know how to start. He continued to peek at Cale every so often while staring at his feet. Lock lightly bit down on his lips a couple of times. He didn\u2019t like this personality of his very much. At that moment, Lock heard a cold voice.\u201cSpit it out.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dLock lifted his head up to see Cale. This was the first time Lock made eye contact with Cale since coming into the room. Cale kept eye contact with Lock, as he continued to speak.\u201cGood. When you are talking to someone, you should make eye contact like this.\u201dHe continued on.\u201cSpit out everything you want to say.\u201dCale looked at the clock before looking back at Lock, who was looking at him with a blank expression on his face.\u201cI will at least listen to what you have to say.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dLock let out a gasp. He clenched his fidgeting hands and finally started to speak.\u201cI, I am the older brother.\u201dHis voice was weak. His body was large, but he was still a young boy.\u201cI need to take care of my younger siblings.\u201dLock knew that he was still lacking a lot to be called a member of the Wolf Tribe. However, he had 10 younger siblings that he needed to protect and care for right now.In addition.\u201cI was also a nephew and a younger brother.\u201dThe Blue Wolf Tribe loved and cherished the cowardly and stupid Lock. He could not forget about his family, friends, and neighbors who cared for him so much.\u201cThat is why I need to get my revenge.\u201dThat was why he needed to pay them back for everything they took from him.Lock pressed down on his shaking hands and said whatever came to mind. Once he did that, he felt his head clearing up a bit. He then bowed his head and could see his feet and the carpet. He then heard a voice.\u201cYoung wolf boy.\u201dLock lifted his head up. Cale Henituse. This owner of a large residence that Lock couldn\u2019t even dream of when he lived in his village, was someone that Choi Han hyung had said was worth betting at least \u2154 of his life on. Such a man was bluntly speaking to him.\u201cYou are a wolf.\u201dLock started to recall many past memories. He could see his life in the Blue Wolf Tribe.\u201cWolves protect their families and put them first, before even themselves. I consider them to be a tribe to be proud of.\u201dLock could see a smiling face in front of him.\u201cI have heard what you wanted to say.\u201dAt that moment, Lock could clearly see this man and everything in this room. On either side of Cale were the cute Cat Tribe kittens, and the sunlight coming into the room made it seem very peaceful.Lock finally remembered the words that he needed to say, and the words he wanted to say.\u201cThank you very much for your help. And\u2026please help me.\u201dThe owner of this peaceful atmosphere started to speak.\u201cOnce was enough for the thanks.\u201dThe reason Cale was thinking so much about how to act like a trash these days was because of Choi Han and the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon itself was a concern, while Choi Han was a concern because of the things he brought back with him.\u201cI do not wish to help you.\u201dCale did not want to help Lock. However, he knew the pain the 10 wolf children were feeling after losing their parents and their support. He had experienced it himself. Furthermore, he already had a foot inside this situation. He did not want to be responsible for everything.He planned to do just the bare minimum, so that he would break even.Cale continued to speak toward Lock, who was lowering his head after hearing Cale say that he did not want to help him\u201cHowever, I do have plans to make a deal with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 A deal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale continued to speak.\u201cWhat do you need help with? And what can you do for me in return?\u201dCale had no desire to teach this wolf boy, who was not experienced with anything. That was for Choi Han or Rosalyn to deal with. Cale stood up, as he still had a couple things to take care of before heading to the palace, before speaking once more to the wolf boy.\u201cCome back when you have the answers.\u201dLock thought for a moment, before getting up from the seat and bowing his head.\u201cI understand. I will come back to see you when I have figured things out.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dCale lightly patted Lock\u2019s head once. The gaze in Lock\u2019s eyes as he looked up was quite satisfactory.* * *Cale grabbed the crown prince\u2019s invitation and got off the carriage. The gathering was to start at 5 pm. Cale looked at the palace, that was incomparable to both the Henituse estate and their residence in the capital combined.The Palace of Joy. The name of the location of the gathering was called the Palace of Joy, and it was built by the king to share his joy of the birth of the crown prince. Of course, the king now favored the third prince.Cale was planning to meet up with Eric, Gilbert, and Amiru outside the palace and enter together. He looked toward the palace and started to think.\u2018Is this a cliche too?\u2019It just so happened that someone else arrived at the palace right when Cale arrived.\u201cWow, who is this? Isn\u2019t this our famous young master Cale?\u201d\u2018Sigh.\u2019Cale held back his sigh. He could feel the distaste from the person before him just from their tone. The person approaching him was Neo, the successor to Viscount Tolz.\u2018Why do I have to run into one of Venion\u2019s minions now?\u2019Neo Tolz was one of the stereotypical villains. He went around doing Venion\u2019s biddings.The village that the Black Dragon was tortured in belonged to Viscount Tolz.And Viscount Tolz\u2019s people never liked the Henituse family. It was because, although they were separated only by a single mountain, the difference in wealth was drastic. However, in the past, they were once friendly with the Henituse family.That all changed once they went under Marquis Stan\u2019s faction 5 years ago. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t say it out loud, but they would stealthily try to take control of the Northeastern nobles meeting.Neo Tolz smiled brightly as he stood in front of Cale.\u201cYou are alone?\u201dThey were still a bit away from the palace entrance, and the Vice Captain and Ron were speaking with the guard to get permission to enter. Cale, who brought only the minimal amount of people with him, looked down to Neo.Neo saw that Cale was alone, and thus pushed his subordinates back.\u201cI am going to chat with young master Cale for a bit. Go get permission for us to enter.\u201dNeo sent his subordinates to the guard, and took one step closer to Cale. Once the two of them were standing very close, Neo started to speak.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dNeo had a warm and friendly smile on his face, as he spoke in a quiet voice that only Cale could hear.\u201cWhat is a terrible trash like you doing coming to the palace?\u201d\u2018Sigh, so childish. Is it like this because it is a world inside a book? Or is it because it is a fantasy world? Is it possible that punks like this exist in the real world too? They must exist since he\u2019s provoking me like this.\u2019The son of a viscount dares to speak like this to the son of a count? Cale thought it was only happening because it was a novel, but actually dealing with this made Cale extremely frustrated.\u2018I\u2019m not even the MC. Can I not deal with cliches like this?\u2019Cale wanted to just tell Ron to kill these stupid villains who didn\u2019t know their place.Cale just continued to look down at Neo. Neo\u2019s expression brightened even more. To Neo, Cale was a trash who just looked fine on the outside. For someone like Neo, who had to suck up to Venion the entire time he was at the capital, Cale was a good prey to bother.\u201cWhat? Do you want to throw a bottle at me? Or do you want to hit me? Go ahead and try.\u201d\u2018He\u2019s just provoking me. He\u2019s doing it on purpose. He can\u2019t take any magic items into the palace, so he won\u2019t be able to take a magic recording device inside. That is why he\u2019s trying to rile me up out here.\u2019If Cale caused a ruckus here, it would be seen as a fight between a trash and a dignified noble. It would only be to Neo\u2019s advantage, that was why he was trying to provoke Cale to bring down the Henituse family name.Cale just sat there. He then heard a voice inside his head.It was the dragon speaking through magic.What a bastard. It reminds me of that bastard Venion.\u2018He is Venion\u2019s minion.\u2019Although Cale could not say that out loud, the dragon continued to speak in Cale\u2019s mind.Should I kill him?\u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to do that.\u2019Cale shook his head to the dragon who was following him while remaining invisible.Seeing Cale shake his head made Neo provoke Cale once again, as it did not look like Cale was going to bite.At that moment, Cale\u2019s gaze turned to a new carriage that just arrived.Bang! The carriage door burst open as soon as the carriage stopped, and Eric Wheelsman got out of the carriage. Gilbert and Amiru were inside the carriage as well.Cale signaled Eric, who was rushing over with his eyes wide open, with his eyes while pointing to Neo with his index finger.\u201cHyung-nim.\u201dCale\u2019s sincere voice that called out to him, as well as the cold gaze in Cale\u2019s eyes, told Eric everything he needed to know.\u2018Get rid of him.\u2019The eyes of the calmly standing Cale were giving that message to Eric.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mm! Young master Neo, it has been a while.\u201dEric immediately moved in between Cale and Neo. Neo\u2019s eyes seemed to be defeated.He thought he had found a good prey, but it was now difficult to hunt this prey with Eric Wheelsman present.\u201cYes, young master Eric. I hope you have been well.\u201dNeo greeted Eric that way before also greeting young lady Amiru and young master Gilbert. He then saw them all standing in front of Cale, and clicked his tongue.\u2018I guess they are protecting him. Even if he is trash, he is still on their side after all.\u2019Neo decided not to do anything after seeing the three of them protecting Cale. Eric noticed Neo\u2019s intent, and slowly turned around to look at Cale.Neo\u2019s gaze turned to Cale as well.\u201cMm.\u201dNeo then subconsciously let out a groan.Cale was quietly looking down at Neo with his arms crossed. Cale\u2019s eyes were extremely scornful. He had not said anything to Neo since earlier on, but his gaze and his body language said everything that needed to be said.\u2018Classless fool.\u2019It made Neo think about the gaze Venion used to look at him. Even though Neo was angry when Venion looked at him with such a gaze, he consoled himself by saying it was the look of a higher ranking noble and let it go.Cale turned away after watching Neo\u2019s shaking pupils for a while, and looked behind him. He heard the Black Dragon\u2019s report in his ear.There was a reason he brought the Black Dragon with him today.The voice recording magic is ready.Cale had asked the Black Dragon to record everything that happened today. Video recording required a lot of mana usage and was difficult to maintain for a long period of time, so Cale had to be satisfied with just voice recording.Cale was originally not going to do this because the palace would have a lot of mages who were sensitive to mana, but the Black Dragon assured him that it would be undetected as long as the range of the voice recording was small.Cale made up his mind to use this in the future to make Neo cry tears of blood, before heading toward the palace entrance. Cale was the type of person to always pay back his debts.\u00a0[1]Eric Wheelsman watched Cale walk away like a proud brother. He was thinking that the letters he sent every day must have worked.On the other hand, Gilbert and Amiru watched Cale with curious expressions. Cale Henituse, the man who used to only wear flashy clothes, chose to wear a simple black outfit without any accessories. Even his red hair was clean and shining from the sun.They wondered if it was because Cale was not drunk.Each of Cale\u2019s steps looked relaxed and calm.Amiru and Gilbert watched Cale turn around once he got to the palace entrance.Cale\u2019s gaze, that seemed to be beckoning them over, was the most curious thing for them.\u201cYoung master Neo, I will see you inside. Young lady Amiru and young master Gilbert, let us go.\u201dEric was watching Cale proudly, but Amiru and Gilbert had an even stranger sensation when the three of them stood in front of Cale.Cale looked at the two confused people, as well as the proud Eric, and started to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe three of them followed Cale into the palace. Gilbert and Amiru\u2019s odd sensation continued to grow the farther they followed Cale. Cale did not care however, and decided he would use these three people as much as he could today.\u201cYoung master Cale-nim of Count Henituse\u2019s household is entering the hall!\u201dCale could hear the servant shout out Eric, Gilbert, and Amiru\u2019s names as well as he walked into the hall.\u201cNot bad.\u201dHe looked around the large hall before walking behind Eric. Young lady Amiru peeked toward Cale, before walking next to him and starting to speak.\u201cYoung master Cale. At the front of the banquet hall is the crown prince\u2019s seat, and the tables are split based by region. The reason for that-.\u201dAmiru, who was about to explain the reason for why the tables are split based on region, looked at Cale\u2019s expression, before changing what she was going to say.\u201cI probably don\u2019t need to explain the reason, right?\u201d\u201cThank you very much, young lady Amiru, but I know the reason.\u201dCale watched Amiru nod her head with a curious expression on her face, and then headed toward the tables to the Northeast section of the room.There were five tables inside the hall. Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and the center. They were all divided based on each of the noble factions.\u2018The crown prince is good at things like this.\u2019He controlled things in the background to make the factions compete with each other while also forcing them to come together every so often. It was the crown prince\u2019s specialty. But the crown prince was very thorough about his own treatment as well.The crown prince\u2019s table was located to the front of all five of these tables, at a location that was about two steps higher than the rest.\u2018The second and third prince\u2019s seats are one step lower than his.\u2019One step lower than the crown prince\u2019s table was the table for the second and third princes. Even if this event was being hosted by the crown prince, it would be weird for the second and third princes to not attend a gathering of nobles. Since the crown prince was the one to host it, he made sure to show a gap between their status.\u2018He really pays attention to these tiny, useless details.\u2019The crown prince, actually, all of the people in those positions of power, were really not Cale\u2019s type of people.\u201cOur table is closest to the entrance, as expected.\u201dCale did not respond to Eric\u2019s bitter voice. The Palace of Joy had opened the eastern entrance as the designated entrance, and the Northeastern region nobles\u2019 table was the closest to the door.Although the Northeastern region had a voice, they did not have a household that was strong enough to have a loud voice. Cale raised his hand to pat Eric\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s great that our seat is close to the door. In addition, it is great that we don\u2019t have anyone we have to lower our head to at our seat.\u201dOther regions had strong people in charge, like Marquis Stan, whom the rest had to be respectful to and subservient.The other three people walking with Cale stopped walking. Cale also stopped walking after seeing them halt. Eric turned around to look at Cale for a while, before finally starting to speak.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dSince they were in the company of others, Eric did not call Cale casually by name.\u201cI\u2019m glad that my efforts seem to have paid off.\u201d\u2018Efforts? What efforts?\u2019Cale looked toward Eric with shock and confusion, but Eric turned back around and proudly walked to the table that was closest to the entrance.Eric did not know that Cale never read his letters and just shoved them to a corner of the room.\u201cWhy is he like this?\u201dYoung lady Amiru shook her head at Cale\u2019s question. Gilbert showed a similar reaction. Cale then shrugged his shoulders and headed toward the table.But an announcement made him stop moving.\u201cYoung master Venion Stan of Marquis Stan\u2019s household has arrived!\u201dCale understood why Neo Tolz did not follow them inside the Palace of Joy. Venion. Neo Tolz was standing right behind Marquis Stan\u2019s successor, Venion.But Cale did not care for chumps like Neo or Venion.\u201cCale!\u201dEric called out to Cale, who suddenly started quickly walking to his seat, but Cale just waved him off and sat down.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cAh, welcome young master Cale.\u201d\u201cHello, young master Cale.\u201dCale gave a short response to all of those respectful greetings.\u201cHello. Good to see all of you.\u201dSilence suddenly filled the table, and Cale put his hand underneath the tablecloth without others noticing.\u2018I knew it.\u2019He could feel the invisible Black Dragon\u2019s body shaking.\u201cI\u2019m okay. I told you that I am okay.\u201dCale listened to the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head, and patted its shaking body. Anger and fear. The Black Dragon\u2019s mind was full of both right now. That was why trauma when you are young is so scary.The Black Dragon did not know how to respond because the physical trauma that its body remembered was not aligned with the rationality in its head.\u201cI am okay. I am a great and mighty dragon.\u201dCale had told the Black Dragon when it said it wanted to follow him that Venion Stan would be here as well. He also got the Black Dragon to promise that it would not kill Venion Stan today. He also promised something else to the dragon.\u201cLater. I will definitely kill that bastard and the rest later.\u201dThe Black Dragon was planning on ripping them into shreds so that they turned into fine particles of dust. Cale calmed the Black Dragon down while listening to its extremely angry voice. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t seem to be causing its mana to go wild because of this anger.Cale thought that dragons really were very rational creatures. Cale thought about the hell that awaited Venion and the idiots who were aligned with Marquis Stan in the future, and stopped patting the dragon.Thankfully, it did not seem like the dragon was going to run wild. If it did, this palace would easily be destroyed, and Cale would probably be dead as well. Cale let out a sigh of relief, before looking around.He could see Eric\u2019s group and Venion\u2019s group both heading this way. It made sense, since Venion\u2019s table was the Northwest table next to them.Tap. Tap.The Black Dragon rubbed his head on Cale\u2019s leg.\u201cMm.\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s action made Cale worry for a moment. He made eye contact with Eric at that time, who was fervently signaling Cale with his eyes.\u2018Stay quiet! Be still!\u2019Cale just ignored the signals. He then debated how he could pretend not to know Venion. However, all of his contemplations were for naught, as Venion greeted him first.\u201cLong time no see, young master Cale.\u201dVenion Stan. He seemed to have gotten many more wrinkles since the last time they met, but he was still showing a gentle smile, fitting for a noble. However, Neo Tolz was behind him looking extremely anxious.Cale smiled brightly and started to speak.\u201cHello, young master Venion. This is our first meeting since we met in Viscount Tolz\u2019s territory last time.\u201dVenion\u2019s gentle smile became thicker, while Neo\u2019s face became completely pale.Marquis Stan was one of the four leaders in the kingdom\u2019s politics. The successor of such a person visited the Northeast region. Not only that, it was to a low ranking noble territory like Viscount Tolz\u2019s territory. It was obviously showing that Viscount Tolz was under the Marquis\u2019s faction.Naturally, the Northeastern nobles all started to frown, and the other nobles in the hall started to pay attention as well. The Northeast was a region without a leader right now.\u201cCorrect. I went to visit my friend, young master Neo, and was heading back home.\u201dVenion Stan did not care about the gazes that were heading his way. There was no problem for him to go to the Northeast region. Venion was looking at Cale, as if he was observing him, but his voice was still gentle.\u201cYes. We said we would share a drink at the capital.\u201d\u201cWe did indeed.\u201dBoth Cale and Venion seemed very calm while chatting with each other. However, the people watching them could not be as calm.Cale looked toward Neo Tolz, who was peeking at him and started to smile. Neo flinched while looking at Cale\u2019s smile.\u201cAh, right. The day after I met you, young master Venion, one of the Viscount Tolz\u2019s knights came to find me.\u201dCale started to speak to Neo with a very concerned expression.\u201cI heard the villa was ransacked completely clean. Is everything okay?\u201dNeo\u2019s shoulders flinched, and Cale could see the corner of Venion\u2019s lips starting to twitch.\u201cDid you hear about it young master Venion? I\u2019m sure you have since you said the two of you are good friends.\u201dVenion finally responded after a bit of time. He was speaking very naturally, but Cale could feel the anger inside Venion\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026Yes. It was very sad to hear.\u201d\u201cYes. You don\u2019t know how shocked I was to hear about it while I was having my hangover drink. How could they ransack the place clean and not leave anything behind! They said you lost something very important, young master Neo?\u201dThe most annoying people in the world were the ones with loose lips, the ones with no tact, and the righteous.Cale was acting like all three right now. He was having so much fun.\u00a0[2]Cale warmly spoke to Neo.\u201cYoung master Neo, cheer up. We\u2019re bound to face such unbelievable situations at least once in our lives.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I suppose so.\u201dNeo could not even look at Venion, as he just haphazardly responded to Cale.\u201cYou need to drink to forget about everything when something terrible like that happens. Young master Neo, let\u2019s get wasted tonight. Young master Venion, would you like to join us as well?\u201dVenion calmly observed Cale. He had lost the Marquis\u2019s trust since losing the Black Dragon. Venion was suspecting the organization that gave him the Black Dragon based on the knights\u2019 testimony and the evidence left behind, but he could not get rid of the suspicion he had for Cale\u2019s group, who happened to spend a night there at the same time.But he didn\u2019t have any good reasons to suspect Cale. That was why he had spoken to Cale to confirm one more time.\u201cIf you drink and then wake up to have a hangover drink, all your bad memories will disappear.\u201dBut seeing Cale Henituse continue to spew nonsense like before made Venion realize he did not need to confirm anything.\u201cThank you for the offer, young master Cale. Maybe next time.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s disappointing, but I guess next time it is.\u201dVenion walked past Cale. As he did, he could hear Cale speaking to Neo.\u201cYour knight was extremely pale young master Neo. You should have prepared in advance for such a situation. How could you lose all those valuable things at once? Cheer up. You may not recover what you lost, but what can you do about it? You have to just live on.\u201d\u2018Sigh. That trash.\u2019Venion smiled at the nobles who were observing him after hearing that he went to the Northeast, and held back his anger.\u2018That stupid dragon and that paralyzed son of a bitch. Where did all of them go?\u2019Venion only looked forward as he walked. After taking a peek at Venion walking away, Cale turned away from the extremely pale Neo without any hesitation. Of course, he gave Neo a final remark before doing so.\u201cCheer up.\u201dCale knew that Neo would be ripped a new one by Venion.\u201cYoung master Cale-\u201dCale watched Eric, who looked like he had a lot to say but could not figure out how to say it, before sitting back down.\u201cIt is my turn next.\u201dCale nodded his head after hearing the Black Dragon\u2019s voice, and looked around the table. The Northeastern nobles were all looking at him. This was probably the first time they\u2019ve ever seen such a normal version of Cale. That was why Cale picked up the bottle of alcohol in front of him to meet their expectations.They all looked away almost instantly.This was the strength of a trash.However, the people at other tables were still watching Cale with curiosity. Cale ignored those gazes, as he handed the bottle to Eric.\u201cI\u2019ll drink it later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sure.\u201dCale looked away from Eric, who was speaking informally for the first time since coming into the palace, and looked at the clock at the hall entrance. It would soon be time for the feast to start. That was why the nobles all took their seats.The reason was obvious.With Venion Stan\u2019s entrance, the remaining three powerful families entered as well.Young master Antonio Gyerre of Duke Gyerre\u2019s household has arrived!\u201dAntonio Gyerre of Duke Gyerre\u2019s family, young lady Karin Orsena of Duke Orsena\u2019s family, and Marquis Ailan, the other Marquis of the kingdom.They all entered into the hall with their subordinates behind them. The door closed after all of them entered, but there was nobody who got up to chat with them.Cale leaned comfortably in his chair and looked toward the banquet hall entrance. The clock was getting close to 5 pm.Click. Click.The clock reached exactly 5 pm.Screeeeech-The large door opened and the main characters for this gathering showed up with their entourage.The servant was ready to shout louder than he had shouted all night, but the person in front lifted his hand up to stop the servant.Roan Kingdom\u2019s crown prince, the eldest prince of the kingdom, Alberu Crossman.He seemed to enjoy the attention on him, as he headed to his elevated seat without any introduction. All of the nobles got up to greet him, and crown prince Alberu left the second and third princes behind as he headed to the highest spot in the hall.Bang.As soon as he stood in front of his seat, the door closed. It meant that everyone was present.Crown Prince Alberu looked down at the second and third princes, as well as everyone else and started to speak.\u201cWelcome. Thank you for responding to my invitation.\u201dThis was somewhere where he did not need an introduction. Alberu looked down from the top. Cale blankly looked up at him, before looking back at the clock.\u2018It\u2019s about time they got here.\u2019The person who would be the gossip of all of the nobles here for a while had not arrived just yet.Cale could hear the Crown prince starting to speak.\u201cPrecious individuals who will make this kingdom shine, the future leaders of our kingdom, this prince is very happy that all of you have come to this gathering.\u201dThe crown prince was slowly turning on the engines of his glib tongue. It was at that moment.\u201cHmm?\u201dThe crown prince turned his gaze to the entrance. The closed door was being pushed, as if it was being reopened. He could hear some chattering through the gap that was created.Cale started to secretly smile. At that moment, a servant urgently rushed to the crown prince from a different entrance.\u2018They\u2019re here.\u2019Cale was certain.At that moment, the crown prince seemed to be deep in thought for a moment, before he waved at the knight who peeked inside.Screeeech-The large door opened once again.Since it was after the crown prince, the servant did not dare call out the person\u2019s name. But there was no need to do so.\u2018Right on time.\u2019A wheelchair entered into the banquet hall.Taylor Stan, the paralyzed eldest son of Marquis Stan. He had arrived at the banquet hall with the crazy priestess Cage. At that moment, Taylor and Cage\u2019s gazes quickly moved past Cale without anybody noticing. But that was enough for the three of them.1. Cale sounds like a Lannister. (PR: Game of Thrones nerd.)2. (PR: I love this little bastard.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The banquet hall\u2019s room closed tightly once more. Taylor Stan was wearing a luxurious formal wear even though he was on a wheelchair, and there was a relaxed smile on his face. Priestess Cage was wearing the God of Death priestess robe.\u2018I guess they decided to flat out reveal their identities.\u2019Cale thought it was a wise decision. The Temple of the God of Death may get a headache over it, but why would Cage care about that?\u201cWhat is this \u2026!\u201dA shocked and angry voice came from the Northwest table. When Cale turned to look, Venion jumped out of his seat with anger as he glared at Taylor.This was a reaction you would normally never see out of Venion, and a reaction that went against the noble etiquette, but Venion was not in a state to care about etiquette right now.Cale looked up to the top of the platform. Crown prince Alberu opened his arms and started to speak.\u201cI did not expect to see Marquis Stan\u2019s eldest son, Taylor Stan, and a priestess of the God of Death here.\u201dThe crown prince seemed happy. Taylor showed his respects while still sitting on his wheelchair.\u201cI heard that there was an opportunity for the kingdom\u2019s nobles to meet with and discuss with your majesty. I do apologize for coming without an invitation.\u201dThe crown prince Alberu had a smirk on his face. Cale could tell from that smirk that Alberu properly understood what Taylor meant by being able to have a discussion with the crown prince.\u201cI did ask for each household\u2019s representative, but if the household does not have a representative, there is no issue with who shows up. I guess you were probably upset that I only sent one invitation to the Marquis\u2019s household, Mister Taylor?\u201d\u201cJust a bit, your majesty.\u201dCale peeked toward Venion. A household without a representative. Although it wasn\u2019t official, everybody knew that Venion was going to be the successor to the Marquis. The crown prince\u2019s words wre said to subtly take a dig at Venion. IT was probably because Marquis Stan was close to the third prince.\u2018That is the weird part.\u2019Cale found that fact to be weird. Although he didn\u2019t care about it and didn\u2019t look into it, even if the king cherished the third prince, it should not be easy to replace the crown prince.Even still, the crown prince was uncomfortable and wary of the second and third princes in the novel, and Marquis Stan was close to the third prince. The other factions all had a prince they supported as well.\u2018I guess there is something there.\u2019Naturally, that \u2018something\u2019 was not something Cale did not wnat to know about.\u201cI do feel bad for making you upset. But I am glad that you look very healthy, Mister Taylor. It has been a while since we last met.\u201dTaylor smiled and responded to the crown prince.\u201cYour majesty, my legs may not move, but my hands, head, eyes, ears, mouth, everything else is still very much alive. No, in fact, they have gotten even stronger.\u201d\u201cI see. Indeed, you are still alive. I have forgotten that the strongest is the one who manages to live until the end.\u201dCale could see that the crown prince was completely hooked. He then turned to see that Venion once again had a noble-like expression on his face, but he was still glaring at Taylor with a piercing glare.Cale found this situation to be quite entertaining.\u2018I\u2019ll be fun to watch.\u2019The crown prince, Taylor, Venion, and the nobles of the different factions. It was fun looking at the expressions on all of their faces. It made Cale long for some popcorn. This was a tense situation that could burst at any moment.Cale liked it very much that he was just going to be still.\u201cThen is the lady a priestess of the God of Death?\u201d\u201cThis servant of eternal rest named Cage greets your majesty.\u201dCage seemed like a saint as she said the traditional greeting of the priestesses of the God of Death. However, there was much knowledge about curses in her mind.The crown prince received Cage\u2019s greeting before speaking to Taylor.\u201cLet us talk later. It is time for this gathering to start. I am not sure where to sit the two of you.\u201dThe crown prince confirmed that he would make some time to chat with Taylor later. Cale peeked over to the Northwest table. All of them were full of concern and anxiety. Neo Tolz was extremely bad; he seemed to be extremely anxious and fidgety.Cale started to smile after seeing Neo Tolz acting that way. Neo frowned and turned his away, thinking about how there could be such a stupid idiot who could not tell what was going on right now.Cale watched Neo\u2019s actions with a smile before lifting his head up and turning to look in Taylor\u2019s direction. It was at that moment.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Cale made eye contact with the crown prince. It was a coincident. The crown prince Alberu was looking around to see where a good spot for Taylor and Cage may be and Cale was turning to look at Taylor. But in the process, the two of them made eye contact.Cale had a bad feeling right away.\u2018Right here.\u2019\u201cI guess there is a good spot for you.\u201dThe crown prince made up his mind and Cale quickly realized where it would be.\u2018I guess this is the only possible spot.\u2019This was the only table without a high-ranking noble. Although there were families who chose to become subservient to the different factions, there was still a balance of power on this table. Furthermore, there was a household on this table that was the strong and wealthy enough that even the high-ranking nobles did not dare to poke.\u201cMister Taylor can sit at the Northeast nobles\u2019 table. There just happens to be some extra seats there.\u201dGasp. Cale heard Neo\u2019s gasp and saw Eric\u2019s concerned expression as he turned his gaze to Taylor and Cage.\u201cThank you for providing seats for us, your majesty.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, your majesty.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing. We should work together with people who will make great contributions to the kingdom in the future.\u201dThe crown prince said that as he looked toward the Northeast nobles\u2019 table. Servants quickly rushed over to the table as Alberu started to speak.\u201cCan we fix up the seats a bit?\u201dWho could say no to the crown prince? Eric stood up and responded to Alberu.\u201cOf course, your majesty.\u201dEric was able to act this way because he needed to talk to Alberu about investing in the Northeastern shoreline, and because he has refused to become subservient to another high-ranking noble. His actions made the other nobles on the table stand up as well, and the servants quickly worked to set up the table to include Taylor and Cage.It progressed without a hitch. But Cale, who had been watching this on the side, started to notice something odd. Eric noticed Cale\u2019s expression and quickly came over with a concerned expression to whisper to Cale.\u201cCale, remember. Be still. Just be still.\u201dCale ignored Eric\u2019s words and looked at his seat. The new guests were going to be seated next to Cale. This was probably decided by the crown prince as well.\u2018It\u2019s not like he can put them next to someone else\u2019s dog. Our family is the strongest of the remaining four households.\u2019The servants bowed after finishing before departing.\u201cPlease sit.\u201dAlberu gestured to the group and Cale quickly walked over to sit back down. There was no chair to his side, however, a wheelchair soon came to fill that spot.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dTaylor greeted the Northeastern nobles as he joined them. Cage naturally sat down next to Taylor. The two of them, no, all three of them including Cale, pretended like this was their first meeting with each other.This is entertaining.Cale agreed with the Black Dragon\u2019s voice transmitted in his mind and looked toward the crown prince.\u201cThen, although it was slightly delayed, let us resume.\u201dThe crown prince announced the start of the gathering.\u201cI wanted to gather together the individuals who will bring forth the future of our kingdom and share a meal together. Thank you all for showing up and I hope we have a wonderful meal.\u201dAs soon as the crown prince finished speaking, the servants entered with plates of food for each table. An orchestra started to play background music from the back of the hall as well.This was the difference with a real feast. It was a mix of a feast and discussion, with moving between tables being natural.\u201cYoung master Cale, we plan to go greet the crown prince in a bit.\u201dCale nodded his head at Amiru\u2019s statement and focused on the food on his plate. But his mind became a bit complicated.\u2018What is his intention?\u2019There was no way the crown prince just called the nobles for no reason. He definitely had a reason. Cale had a few different ideas about what it may be.\u2018It might be because of the war in the Western COntinent\u2019s southern region or because he caught wind about the civil war that will happen in the Whipper Kingdom.\u2019The Whipper Kingdom was where princess Rosalyn was headed to, the kingdom with the Magic Tower. A civil war will soon break out in the Whipper Kingdom. A war will break out between the mages and the non-mages.There were a lot of thoughts in his head, but Cale decided to stop thinking about it.\u2018No need for me to care since I will just be very still.\u2019It was none of Cale\u2019s business. He just started to enjoy the food in front of him.Looks yummy. Looks so yummy. The weak humans are very good at cooking.Cale enjoyed the food while listening to the Black Dragon\u2019s envious ranting. The food in the palace really was delicious.His hand subconsciously headed for the wine glass that the servant left for him, but it quickly disappeared.\u201cCale, just five minutes.\u201dCale nodded his head at Eric\u2019s sincere plea and turned back to the food. The rest of the Northeastern nobles quietly watched him. The Northeast was already in an awkward situation with the 10 families broken apart into different factions, but now, this magic bomb-like character, Taylor Stan, was a part of the table as well.People watched Cale, who could eat in this tense situation, with curiosity.Cale could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head.By the way, there are magic video recording tools all around this hall.\u201cOh.\u201dCale let out a gasp and started to smile. Anybody watching would think he acted this way after eating something delicious.\u2018I know at least one thing.\u2019Cale then felt like he figured out one of the crown prince\u2019s goals.First of all, the crown prince was watching the nobles. The second and third prince naturally know about this as well. Which means, this was something the entire royal family wanted.The corner of Cale\u2019s lips moved up just a bit. Eric, who became uncomfortable looking at that smile, jumped up from his seat. Amiru and Gilbert followed him up as well. There were already many nobles who went up to greet the crown prince.Cale slowly got up after seeing the three of them get up, and lightly brushed his hair back as he started to speak.\u201cShall we go?\u201dCale stood behind the three nobles and headed up the platform to meet with the crown prince.\u201cOh, our Northeastern nobles!\u201dThe crown prince welcomed the four of them with a bright smile. The crown prince had been shaking hands with everybody who came up to greet him.Alberu Crossman. His blonde hair and blue eyes made him look like a live version of a fairytale prince. The beautiful blonde hair was something that was unique to the Crossman family, the royal family of the Roan Kingdom. They called it the symbol of receiving the Sun God\u2019s blessing.\u201cYour majesty, it is great to see you. Eric Wheelsman greets his majesty for the first time in a while.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, Mister Eric. Don\u2019t we have something to talk about?\u201dEric responded back to the crown prince who brought up the Northeastern shoreline investment issue with a bright expression.\u201cYes! I am waiting for a good moment to discuss it with you!\u201d\u201cI am also waiting for that moment. You are the intelligent young master of Count Wheelsman\u2019s family. The Wheelsman family is responsible for the entrance to the Northeast region and has been doing a very good job. How could I push that off?\u201d\u2018He\u2019s slowly getting into it.\u2019Cale quietly stood there while watching Eric who was smiling at the crown prince who was slowly activating his glib tongue. The crown prince was praising Gilbert and Amiru as well.\u2018Interesting.\u2019Cale quietly watched it all until it was his turn. The crown prince reached his hand out to Cale who slightly bowed his head.\u201cMr. Cale of the Henituse family that is responsible for the edge of our Northeastern region. It may be my first time meeting you, but thanks to Count Deruth\u2019s good work, we are no longer afraid of the FOrest of Darkness. You don\u2019t know how reassuring that is for me and everyone else.\u201dCale had one goal while coming here today.\u201cI heard that Mister Cale is a very free spirit. I\u2019m sure this is because the artistic souls of the sculptures in the Henituse territory has given you an epiphany? I feel like your free spirit makes your soul very pure.\u201dIt was probably difficult to praise someone who was famous as a trash like this. In that aspect, the crown prince was amazing.However, he had no choice but to talk good about Cale as long as Cale does no do anything trashy in this gathering. The royal family wanted the Northeast under their control as well. Furthermore, there were no royalty who would despise someone like Count Henituse who ruled over his territory very well.\u2018That is why this preference for certain people will not impact the families.\u2019Cale sincerely grabbed the crown prince\u2019s hand as he started to use his own glib tongue. It was his turn now.The crown prince had blonde hair and was wearing a formal outfit. Cale had his red hair and a formal outfit as well. Both of them looked relaxed. Cale\u2019s calm voice filled the air.\u201cI also felt something after meeting your majesty today. I realized that in addition to our current sun, his highness, we also have you, the one who will shine over the night to watch over the citizen\u2019s at night. It was a wonderful image for my eyes.\u201dCale\u2019s voice was very calm and relaxed, and he looked very confident.\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201dBut the crown prince seemed confused for a moment before his expression returned to normal. Cale did not miss this change.Cale continued on in a sincere voice.\u201cIndeed your majesty. I may not be able to sleep at night now that I have personally met you, the star in the mind of our citizens.\u201dEric\u2019s jaws dropped while Gilbert and Amiru could not help look at Cale in disbelief. Cale could see the crown prince starting to think. He felt like he took another step toward his goal of \u2018getting away from the crown prince.\u2019At that moment, the Black Dragon muttered something odd.Why did this weakling called the crown prince dye his hair with magic? It is at a level that only a great and mighty dragon like me would notice it. Did another dragon dye his hair? No, is it some other type of power?\u2018Shit.\u2019At this moment, Cale realize that he had learned another useless secret that he could not even reveal the tiniest bit to anyone else.\u2018Is it a secret of a birth this time?\u2019Cale did not care to know about such things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know.'The Black Dragon kept on dragging on about asking why a dragon would ever use its magic for such an useless man and how he would never do such a thing, but Cale tried his best to not listen.Hmm? His pupils are also dyed. This weakling is definitely plotting something. Weak human, be careful.\u2018If you stop talking, I think I'll be fine.\u2019Hmm? This person is not weak. Weak human, be extra careful. You will die.\u2018Shit.\u2019Cale was frightened of this Black Dragon, that was explaining useless things, for the first time. At the same time, Cale's mind began to think quickly.The prince's mother was not the queen. She was a concubine, and she originally was a servant, one of the citizens who worked in the royal family. The third prince's mother was the current queen. The crown prince\u2019s mother is said to have had a questionable death when the crown prince was young.Cale started to naturally think about the true identity of the crown prince\u2019s mother.The prince was known to be average, but the dragon was saying that he is not it weak. In the novel, even Choi Han judged the crown prince to be normal, so what was he hiding? And how did the dragon find out?'\u2026 No. Whether he hides it or not, it is not my business. 'Cale did not listen to the murmuring black dragon. Something must have been really interesting, as the Black Dragon continued to talk about the crown prince.\"\u2026 Mister Cale seems to be a bit like me.\"The crown prince was saying something, but Cale was too busy thinking about things, so he just casually responded.\u201cYour majesty, such statement is the biggest honor of my life.\u201dThe crown prince let go of Cale\u2019s hand, as if he was nervous. Cale did not notice the nervousness, and stepped back without a word, moving behind Eric. It was easy to use Eric as a shield when things got complicated.The crown prince observed Cale with curiosity, before turning his gaze over to Eric.Eric started to speak with the crown prince once again.Cale watched him and started to think.\u2018There is a reason.\u2019There was a reason the crown prince was wary of the second and third princes. There was also a reason as to why the king\u2019s favor suddenly went to the third prince. He was able to guess it all.\u2018Is he not really his son? Or is there a different secret to his birth?\u2019Cale\u2019s mind went to a drama that Kim Rok Soo saw while working at a restaurant after graduating high school.The crown prince, Alberu Crossman, was naturally the main character.Cale reaffirmed himself once more.\u2018Be still.\u2019He would be still from here on. He made the decision to not find out about anything else.Cale thoroughly kept that promise. He did not drink any alcohol today, and that led to the nobles from other regions, who had never met him previously, approaching him to talk. Cale looked to Eric every time, and Eric got to work.After this happened a couple of times, Cale quietly mumbled to himself.\u201cOh. This is pretty nice.\u201dGilbert and Amiru flinched after hearing that quiet murmuring, and started to talk to each other using their eyes.\u2018Isn\u2019t this weird?\u2019\u2018Right?\u2019The two of them slightly moved away from Eric and Cale. However, Cale looked toward young lady Amiru, and Amiru stopped moving backward after making eye contact with Cale.\u201cBy the way, young lady Amiru.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI heard the shoreline of your territory is extremely beautiful. Is it true?\u201d\u201cOf course. The cliffs overlooking the coast are very beautiful.\u201d\u2018Beautiful my ass.\u2019Cale thought about the cliff and about how it would be extremely difficult to earn the, \u2018Sound of the Wind.\u2019 In the novel, the, \u2018Sound of the Wind,\u2019 was an ancient power that a member of the non-mage faction in Whipper Kingdom ended up finding.Although it might be strange that a person from the Whipper Kingdom ended up with an ancient power in the Roan Kingdom, there was a long story behind that as well.Anyways, that power originally went to a mage slayer, an extremely brutal fool who appears near the second half of the civil war. He was already strong enough that he didn\u2019t really put it to much use.\u2018The magic tower will fall soon.\u2019After the civil war, a new magic tower would be built on the site of the fallen magic tower, and Rosalyn will end up being in charge of that new magic tower.\u2018Choi Han, the mage slayer, and the Empire\u2019s crown prince.\u2019These three people are the ones who appear as the heroes for all of the incidents in the middle of the Western continent. The novel also discussed how the Queen of the Western continent\u2019s Southern Jungle ended up getting involved with the matter of unifying the South as well.Putting the secret organization that Choi Han constantly runs into aside, this continent will break its 200-year long peace to start fighting for power.Cale looked toward Eric, who was dealing with everything for him, and looked at the clock. The feast would be over soon. Of course, the nobles were waiting for the conversation time that would happen after the meal.\u2018None of my business.\u2019It was none of Cale\u2019s business.\u201cYoung master Gilbert, I should be able to leave after the meal is over, right?\u201dGilbert looked toward Cale, who was leisurely eating fruit like he was out on a picnic, and nodded his head.\u201cYes. We plan to meet with the crown prince after the meal, but you probably don\u2019t plan to go with us, right?\u201d\u201cRight. What good will I do there? The three of you are more informed about the investment information.\u201dGilbert\u2019s expression changed at Cale\u2019s words. He seemed to be a bit surprised.\u201c\u2026You read the document.\u201d\u201cA bit.\u201dCale casually responded, before looking back at the crown prince, who stood up from his seat. He was about to announce the end of the meal. Cale did not find out the real reason behind today\u2019s gathering, but he was not disappointed about it. Not knowing meant there was no chance of him getting caught up in it.But Cale started to frown after hearing the crown prince\u2019s words.\u201cIt was a pleasure to share this dinner with all of you tonight. I have prepared a simple wine party for those who may be interested, so please enjoy yourselves. Ah, I have also prepared a spot for all of you at the birthday celebration that is coming up.\u201dThe crown prince Alberu said all of this with a rather pleasant expression.\u201cI hope that you will all be there to share in the joys of the day.\u201d\u2018Sigh.\u2019Cale held back his sigh. Although Alberu was saying he hoped they would all be there, it was pretty much forcing them to be there.\u2018\u2026I guess I\u2019ll be in the plaza when the bombs go off.\u2019Although it was to be expected, Cale did not like it very much.\u201cThen let us conclude this dinner.\u201dCale stood up from his seat. The majority wanted to go to the wine party with the crown prince and the second and third princes, but those who were not approved to meet with the crown prince could not go, even if they wanted to do so.Cale peeked toward the wheelchair that was moving past him. Taylor passed by him and Cage, who was pushing Taylor\u2019s wheelchair, followed directly afterward and whispered in a quiet voice that only Cale could hear.\u201cSee you later, our little brother.\u201d\u2018I said I didn\u2019t want to be their little brother.\u2019Cale\u2019s gaze clearly showed his feelings, but Cage just pretended to not understand and headed toward the crown prince, while pretending to be a good and pure priestess.\u201cYoung master Cale, let me walk you out.\u201d\u201cYoung lady Amiru.\u201dAmiru approached Cale and offered to walk with him. Cale looked toward Amiru\u2019s green hair and calm yet sophisticated expression, and casually asked.\u201cAre you worried I will cause trouble on my way out?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, young master Neo was heading back early as well.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dShe was saying she was going with him in case Neo tried to start something again. Cale headed toward the banquet hall door without any other questions, with Amiru next to him. The two of them arrived at Cale\u2019s carriage without saying much, and found Ron waiting by the carriage.\u201cYoung master Cale, good job today.\u201dCale nodded his head at Amiru\u2019s words.\u201cIt was hard. But you have to go back and work some more, young lady Amiru.\u201dAmiru smiled and started to speak.\u201cIt is because we need to get some good news.\u201dHowever, Cale could sense the despair in her voice. The Northeastern coast was really a useless piece of land. It was a place filled with cliffs, with nothing else being interesting.Furthermore, the whirlpools around the cliffs were also a problem. The experienced people living in the territory knew how to avoid them, but it was a dangerous place for others.\u2018The, \u2018Sound of the Wind,\u2019 is responsible for the whirlpools.\u2019Amiru and Gilbert would want to get some investment in this useless sea, no matter what. Cale looked toward Amiru, who spoke with a strange expression on her face.\u201cI believe we are capable of getting such results.\u201d\u201cYoung lady Amiru.\u201d\u201cYes, young master Cale.\u201dCale thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to give some help to Eric, Gilbert, and Amiru, whom he worked today like the beast people under his command. They still needed a balance of power in the Northeast nobles\u2019 meeting, and Amiru seemed like someone who would keep secrets pretty well.\u201cI believe his highness will be pretty interested in this investment.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201dAmiru agreed with Cale\u2019s statement. It was because the crown prince remembered the issue, even without Eric bringing it up first.\u201cYou discussed an investment for tourism right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dInvesting in tourism using the coastal cliffs. In Cale\u2019s opinion, it was completely useless. He approached Amiru and whispered in her ears.\u201cIf you are in desperate need of investment, I think it would be good for you to think about the value of the location of your shoreline in relation to the Whipper Kingdom and the other northern Kingdoms.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders at the confused Amiru and added on.\u201cOf course, it would be best if you kept what I just said to yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will remember your words for now.\u201dCale was satisfied with Amiru, who seemed confused, but kept her mouth shut. He got on the carriage and waved to Amiru. Amiru lightly moved her head to respond to his wave.Cale started to speak to Ron, who was closing the carriage door.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dThe carriage soon started to move. Cale looked out at Amiru, who was seriously contemplating what Cale had said without heading back in, and started to think about the Northeastern shoreline.The Northwestern shoreline was made up of sandy beaches. In comparison, Amiru and Gilbert\u2019s territory\u2019s shoreline was complicated, with many small islands. Furthermore, they were also surrounded by sharp cliffs.Finally, there were only a few places where ships could safely be anchored. Of course, the fishermen there were veterans who would be able to avoid the whirlpool to safely fish without any issues.\u2018They only thought about tours and sightseeing because the peace had lasted so long.\u2019But the crown prince will know that the end of the peace was quickly approaching.\u2018Anyways, all I have to do is go get the ancient power before that mage slayer takes it for himself.\u2019Cale decided not to think about it anymore. That night, two reports were delivered to Cale, as he headed back from the feast.\u201cWe found four of the magic bombs.\u201dIn the novel, there were five located in different places, and five located on people.\u201cAll of them were around the plaza.\u201d\u201cShow me the map.\u201dCale reached his hand out to Choi Han. Choi Han had left the Black Dragon at the site of the magic bombs and had returned by himself. He seemed to have rushed back, as there was sweat on his face.\u201cWe found one, and then I ran around with the dragon in my arms to thoroughly look everywhere. We ended up finding three more in the process, but nothing more. I\u2019m sure we need to look somewhere other than the plaza, but there were none in the places we\u2019ve looked so far.\u201d\u201cNo need to rush, since it will be safe until the day of the celebration in two days.\u201d\u201cBut it is better to get rid of dangerous things earlier!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s steal them in early morning of the celebration day.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Excuse me?\u201dThe magic bombs Cale knew about required the developer to send a signal to blow them up. However, for anyone at the Black Dragon or even Rosalyn\u2019s level of magic, it was pretty easy to cut the connection between the developer and the bombs even if it took some time to do so. That was how Rosalyn was able to destroy the bombs on the people in the novel.\u2018That needs to be done the day of the celebration.\u2019That was the only way to make that bloodthirsty mage think everything is fine.\u201cSteal them? We are not going to destroy them?\u201dCale handed the map back to the confused Choi Han, and started to speak.\u201cWhy would we destroy such useful things?\u201dEven if the bombs cannot be used, the densely packed mana inside was a pretty useful ingredient.\u201cI will use it for myself.\u201dChoi Han thought Cale\u2019s smile was pretty sneaky. Cale continued to speak to Choi Han, who accepted the map with a confused expression.\u201cKeep looking since there may be more. Check back multiple times to see if the location of the bomb changes as well.\u201dChoi Han and the Black Dragon will now need to stay hidden around the plaza and continue to investigate. It will be hard, boring, and extremely taxing on their minds, but it was not something Cale was going to do himself.\u00a0[1]Cale looked toward On and Hong, who just woke up from their nap and started to sleep.\u201cTime to pay up.\u201dCale also spoke to Choi Han.\u201cGo work.\u201dThe two kittens, who were rubbing their eyes tiredly, and Choi Han went to work as Cale had instructed. Cale leisurely watched them jump off the terrace window, before drinking the wine he did not get the chance to drink at the banquet, before falling asleep.A piece of information was delivered to Cale while he was sleeping. Cale was able to hear the news after waking up.Billos was going to arrive at the capital today, the day before the birthday celebration. Cale immediately headed to the inn where he was going to meet Billos.It was the place the 10 wolf children were staying. Of course, On, Hong, and Lock were with Cale as he headed to the inn. He thought about what Lock just said, and asked.\u201cYou want me to take care of your siblings?\u201d\u201cYes. That is the condition for my deal.\u201d\u201cAnd what can you do for me?\u201d\u201cIt is not just me that will do it.\u201dLock answered without any hesitation.\u201cIf it is not just you, who else?\u201dLock quickly answered.\u201cMy siblings will do it with me. We are stronger as a group.\u201dCale felt the back of his head turning chilly.\u2018No way.\u2019Lock ruthlessly hit Cale with another mental blow.\u201cThe Blue Wolf Tribe has a famed history of being strong knights. That history-\u201d\u201cIs not something I need to know about.\u201dCale turned away from Lock, who was sitting across from him in the carriage.1.

Cale shook his head to say, \u2018no.\u2019\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cBut.\u201dCale stared at Lock.\u2018You want me to take the ten Blue Wolf Tribe children and you to create a Knights Brigade?\u2019Lock was someone who was afraid of the Whale Tribe but was willing to attack the Chief of the Whale Tribe for his friends.\u2018You want me to take someone who is crazier than some religious fanatics and make him my subordinate?\u2019\u201cNo need to continue speaking about nonsense.\u201dCale\u2019s cold voice made Lock\u2019s shoulders sink. Cale did not care about Lock\u2019s reaction at all and started to speak.\u201cYou want young children to become knights? You asked me to protect the children, but your suggestion seems to go against your request.\u201dIf Cale trained them into knights from such a young age, they would become a group of warriors who would be even crazier than religious fanatics. That was a terrible thought.But most importantly.\u201cWhat about their opinions? Why are you deciding for them?\u201dCale asked the question to Lock, who had made the decision for all of his siblings. Lock had a blank expression for a moment, before lowering his head and apologizing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo need to be sorry.\u201dCale just casually responded to Lock who slightly raised his head.\u201cBut since I know what it is you want from me, I will think about what I want in return.\u201dOf course, he had already thought about what he wanted. He didn\u2019t need it now, but in about 3 months, an ancient power that could be used to make Cale money would appear in a dangerous mountain. It would exist for only 6 months, and someone like Lock in his berserk mode transformation would be best to climb that mountain.\u2018If I sell that ancient power to the Queen of the Jungle, even if our territory goes broke, I will have enough money to indulge for the rest of my life.\u2019He would naturally raise the price before selling it, but he didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with raising the price for someone who should have a lot of money.\u201cWill there be something you need from me?\u201dCale let out a sigh at the worried tone in Lock\u2019s voice. Cale asked once more, as Lock seemed even more concerned.\u201cDon\u2019t ask such obvious question. Of course, I will need your help.\u201dAh. Lock let out a gasp, and then nodded his head.\u201cYes. I will do whatever it is you ask of me. Please let me know once you come to a decision.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dCale said that before taking a small money pouch out of his pocket and throwing it to Lock. Lock caught the pouch as Cale explained the reason for the money.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing your siblings for the first time in a while, so go take them on a tour of the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026A tour?\u201d\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t this your first time in a city like the capital? Go treat them to some delicious food too.\u201d\u2018I can only have a relaxed discussion with Billos if none of you are there.\u2019\u201cOn and Hong will go with you, so you will not get lost.\u201dMeeeeeow.Meow.On and Hong, who were quietly sitting in the carriage, announced their presence after hearing Cale\u2019s statement and approached Lock. They then patted Lock\u2019s leg with their front paws.\u201cStop it, On, Hong. It tickles.\u201dLock caressed their heads like it was cute, but, in Cale\u2019s eyes, the kittens were seriously trying to attack Lock. Cale watched this and started to think.\u2018I should leave the wolf children to Hans later. Otherwise, I will need to find a babysitter for them.\u2019Cale thought it would be great if it was someone who could cook well and kept things clean. Cale was thinking about people who could babysit the wolf children other than Hans when he thought about Beacrox, Ron\u2019s son and the second chef. Thinking about Beacrox made Cale\u2019s expression stiffen.Beacrox was definitely someone who was good at cooking, kept things clean, and had a positive reputation within the Henituse family as someone who was respectful and normal. However, none of that mattered to Cale, since he knew that Beacrox was a lunatic who loved torture. He could not let such a person taint the pure wolf children\u2019s minds.\u00a0[1]\u2018I also need to send him off with Choi Han.\u2019He wasn\u2019t necessary, but, in the novel, Beacrox went with Choi Han and Rosalyn to Breck Kingdom to torture the Grand Admiral. Cale was debating about who would be good to take care of the wolf children, when the carriage arrived at the inn Billos and the wolf children were located.Cale got off the carriage before speaking to Lock.\u201cFollow me.\u201dCale patted the nervous Lock\u2019s shoulder, and Lock walked into the inn with On and Hong in his arms.\u201cWelcome to the Scent of Grapes! How may I help you?\u201dCale responded to the young attendant\u2019s greeting, and immediately headed for the back door. The people Choi Han brought with him were all residing in the villa at the back area of the inn.The attendant tried to follow him, but Cale stopped him and walked to the villa door before motioning to Lock.\u201cYou open the door since it is your younger siblings.\u201d\u201cHuh? Yes!\u201dLock put the kittens down and grabbed the handle. This was his first time seeing his younger siblings since he had his berserk transformation. Cale slowly moved back, because he had a bad feeling that he probably should not see what was beyond the door.Click.Lock turned the doorknob and opened the door. They could see the inside of the villa as soon as the door was opened. It was a comfortable looking space.\u201cSigh.\u201dHowever, Cale took two more steps backward immediately. It was an instinctive movement.\u201cHyung!\u201d\u201cHyung!\u201d\u201cOppa!\u201d\u201cLock oppa!\u201d10 children rushed toward Lock, and Lock ran toward them as well. An emotional reunion was happening in front of Cale\u2019s eyes, but Cale was overwhelmed at the sight of ten wolf children in front of him.At the same time, there was someone that Cale was happy to see.\u201c\u2026Young master.\u201d\u201cLong time no see, Billos.\u201dCale had told Billos to go to this villa. Cale could see that Billos was nervous underneath his smile and looked to the person approaching them from behind Billos.\u201cNice to meet you, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cAre you the merchant who came with Choi Han?\u201dA man in his sixties with a gentle expression and good physique. This person was the one who asked Choi Han to help with the Blue Wolf tribe issue.\u201cYes. I heard a lot of things about you from Mr. Choi Han. It is an honor to meet you, young master.\u201d\u201cAn honor? It is nothing much to see the face of a trash like me.\u201dCale reached his hand out to the man, and the man shook Cale\u2019s hand as he introduced himself.\u201cMy name is Odeus Flynn.\u201dCale started to smile.Odeus Flynn. He was someone who was a strong contender for the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s leader position but gave up on it to start his own small guild.He was Billos\u2019s uncle.He was the person who connected Billos and Choi Han to each other, as well as the person who brought out Billos\u2019s hidden greed.\u2018He is even more devious than Ron.\u2019He acted like he owned a small merchant guild, but, in reality, he was wearing a mask to rule the underworld. He was nice to some, but cruel and vicious to others. That was the type of person Odeus Flynn was.Right now, the only person to know about both sides of Odeus\u2019s character was Cale.Cale pretended not to know anything as he greeted Odeus.\u201cFlynn? You must be related to Billos. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI was shocked as well. I didn\u2019t know Billos was the person young master Cale knew. I have not seen Billos since he was a little boy, so I was very happy to see him again. I feel like I\u2019ve had a lot of good encounters lately.\u201dBillos could not hide his complicated feelings while looking at Odeus. Odeus was someone who threw aside the Flynn Merchant Guild and went to live a simpler life. Furthermore, Odeus was Billos\u2019s uncle, and the only person Billos had good memories about from his childhood.\u2018Well, he is a good person to Billos.\u2019Cale let go of Odeus\u2019s hand and started to speak to Billos.\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and drink.\u201dThe villa was two stories, with a small bar upstairs. Of course, Cale addressed Odeus as well.\u201cChoi Han and Rosalyn will soon arrive, so the three of you can catch up.\u201d\u201cI understand. I hope that I have an opportunity to drink with you in the future as well, young master Cale.\u201dCale smiled and responded back.\u201cLet\u2019s drink together sometime soon.\u201dCale patted Billos\u2019s shoulder as Billos stood there with a complicated expression and tried to head upstairs. However, there were 10 children blocking his way.\u201cThank you very much, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dCale looked toward the 10 children thanking him and started to think.\u2018What a headache.\u2019There were 10 children who all gave off an aura that made Cale believe they would be very strong in the future. Although they watched their parents, cousins, and other family members all be killed right in front of their eyes, their strong and firm pupils let Cale know that they still had their purity and a sense of gratitude.There were also none that were very young. All of them seemed to be between 10 - 13 years old.\u2018I guess they can have a training instructor rather than a babysitter.\u2019However, Cale decided he would not be the person providing them with a training instructor and waved at Lock to head out. He then turned back around and headed upstairs. Although he did not respond and ignored them, Cale could still hear the wolf children thanking him from behind. That made Cale have the chills once again.Billos came up to the second floor and immediately asked Cale a question.\u201cYoung master Cale, just what have you been doing?\u201dCale responded to that question without any hesitation.\u201cDoing what I can for a peaceful future?\u201dBillos had an expression of disbelief on his face, as he brought out some alcohol and glasses from the cabinet. He then sat across from Cale and filled his own cup.\u201c\u2026Do you not see me in front of you?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry young master. I have a lot on my mind.\u201dBillos drank about half the bottle, before looking toward Cale. No, he was observing Cale. This person, who said that he could not live as trash any longer. However, Billos had never expected in his wildest dreams that he would meet his uncle while coming to meet Cale.Cale stopped Billos as he tried to pour another drink and took the bottle from Billos before filling Billos\u2019s cup.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s bugging you, but you can\u2019t just keep drinking by yourself like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Young master Cale.\u201dCale filled Billos\u2019s cup, before responding.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOdeus-nim is my uncle by blood.\u201dOdeus-nim. For Billos, who was not allowed to use the Flynn last name, he could not even call his uncle his uncle. However, Odeus was the only adult who was warm to Billos during his childhood.In the novel, this was what Odeus had said to Billos.\u2018I consider you as my nephew and my family. You have the qualifications for that.\u2019That sentence became a starting point and a turning point for Billos. After being introduced to Choi Han in the novel through Odeus, Billos was in awe of Choi Han\u2019s strength, and decided to follow Choi Han. He also decided to put himself in contention for the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s leader position.\u201cYoung master Cale, aren\u2019t you curious as to why Odeus-nim runs a small merchant guild, even though he has the Flynn last name?\u201d\u2018Not curious? I already know about it.\u2019Odeus was someone who was in full control of the Northwest and Central underworlds. Cale filled his glass, and casually responded.\u201cAm I supposed to be curious about the Flynn name?\u201dHe then drank the alcohol in his cup and saw that Billos was smiling.\u201cI see. I guess the Flynn name is not that grand of a name.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Whether it is you or Odeus, it is the same. You are a Flynn as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I am just a bastard son.\u201d\u00a0[2]Cale snorted and responded to Billos.\u201cThe fact that you are a bastard does not mean that you are not a Flynn. Everybody else just considers you a Flynn.\u201dAlthough the family may not have given Billos the Flynn family name, everybody else considered Billos to be a Flynn. That was why there was nobody who ignored Billos, even though he was a bastard. The Flynn name, as one of the 3 greatest merchant guilds in this world, was a pretty big name. That was the truth.Billos observed Cale, before taking the bottle back from Cale and filling Cale\u2019s cup.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI feel like you are very good at saying the right things.\u201d\u201cI am a bit talented in that.\u201d\u201cThat is why.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cJust what did you steal with the things you borrowed from me?\u201dBillos could see the smile on Cale\u2019s face as he said that. Cale picked up the full glass and leisurely answered.\u201cI already stole one and will steal the rest soon.\u201dHe had already rescued the dragon, and the others would happen tomorrow.The corner of Billos\u2019s lips started to twitch. There were probably no nobles who would say that they were going to steal something, but such a person was in front of his eyes right now.\u201cCan\u2019t I help as well?\u201dCale shook his head at Billos\u2019s question.\u201cUnfortunately.\u201dClack.Cale put the glass down on the table and continued.\u201cAll the spots are full already.\u201dThe list of humans and beast people to use was already in Cale\u2019s head.\u201cHa, haha.\u201dBillos laughed for a bit, before picking up the full glass, drinking it the whole glass in one breath and putting the glass back down on the table.\u201cI guess I should steal something else then.\u201dBillos had already decided what he was going to steal. The position of the successor of the Flynn Merchant Guild. He was going to make that position his. It only made sense, since his greed was larger and deeper than anybody else. Cale started to speak as Billos was thinking.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dBillos laughed once more after hearing Cale\u2019s statement.Cale did not care whether Billos laughed or not. The fact that Billos met Odeus today meant that his goal for today has been accomplished, letting Cale drink in peace.Of course, Cale only enjoyed himself for a bit and returned to the residence on his own to prepare for tomorrow. He needed to start moving in the middle of the night, making him want to go to sleep early in the evening. Unfortunately, he was not able to do so.\u201cRon?\u201dRon bowed to Cale and greeted him.\u201cYoung master, this Ron would like to make a request if possible.\u201d\u201cA request?\u201dRon lifted his head up and started to speak.\u201cPlease take care of my son.\u201d\u201cSon? You mean Beacrox?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dCale could see the benign smile disappear from Ron\u2019s face. This was the first time Cale had ever seen Ron wear a rude expression on his face. Ron started to speak with the assassin\u2019s expression on his face.\u201cI need to go hunt some foxes.\u201dAlthough he was old, Ron was still an assassin. Ron fixed his expression once more and started to speak. His expression was stoic, with only the corners of his lips being slightly elevated.\u201cOur young master knows that I am someone who kills people, right?\u201dCale could feel the buzz from the alcohol instantly disappearing. He was getting the chills once again.1. Beacrox is the S to our PR\u2019s M.2. It is probably similar to GoT, where bastards cannot take the family name and are given names like Snow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a very faint smile, with just the corners of his lips raised a tiny bit. It was one that made the person looking at Ron think that it would be better if he did not smile at all. Ron replied quite pleased.\"That's right. I have to go kill a group of foxes.\"But his voice was cold.\"Rip them into pieces.\"It would either be Ron\u2019s body being ripped into pieces or his targets\u2019 bodies being ripped into pieces. It could only be one of those two scenarios.Cale got goosebumps at the phrase, \u2018rip them into pieces.\u2019 He then started to contemplate.Ron could see that Cale stood there without saying anything for a while. His puppy young master finally started to speak after sighing numerous times.\"\u2026 Go and come back.\"The smile disappeared from Ron\u2019s face. Cale, who was already in his pajamas, laid down on the bed and continued to speak.\"I'll tell Hans that you are taking a leave of absence. Report to me every so often. You can receive money from the Flynn Merchant Guild with your ID plaque. And why would you leave Beacrox to a trash like me? He is an adult. He will figure out what to do with his own life.\u201dCale decided to think easily. There was no need for Ron to be with Choi Han right now. Now that Lock was able to transform into a controlled berserk state, Choi Han would be fine without Ron or Beacrox\u2019s strength.But, for Choi Han, and more importantly, for a peaceful Northeastern region of the Roan Kingdom, Ron was needed one year later.\u201cHowever, the duration of your break is only 1 year.\u201dCale leaned against his pillow and continued.\u201cEnjoy your break.\u201d\u2018Since I have work for you to do in a year.\u2019\"Don\u2019t get hurt while you are out there.\"Cale stretched out his two legs, thinking he had reserved wonderful dreams for the next year. He then looked toward Ron and flinched.The old man, who had been quiet, was actually quietly laughing. That vicious sight made Cale cower underneath the blanket.\u2018What is going on?\u2019Cale's expression stiffened.Ron continued to silently laugh without watching Cale.\u2018I thought this little punk was a son of a bitch, but I, Ron Molan, is the one who is a son of a bitch.\u2019Like a dog that looks at his master. Ron thought that he was like a dog, and responded.\u00a0[1]\u201cYoung master, is reporting to you once a month enough?\u201d\u201cYes. Do as you please.\u201dLike an assassin, Ron opened the door and left the room without making a single noise. He then said one last thing before closing the door.\"I will see you in a year, young master.\u201dWithout waiting Cale's answer, Ron closed the door. Cale quickly fell asleep, relieved that he was free from Ron for a year.Dawn arrived, and six people were standing in front of Cale. There were some that he had personally called, and some that he gathered through Choi Han.Cale looked toward Rosalyn, and started to speak.\u201cMiss Rosalyn, the brown hair looks good on you.\u201dRosalyn was not aware of exactly what will happen today, but understood the severity after hearing the words, \u2018magic bomb,\u2019 and decided to help. Cale had also promised her something in return for her help.\u201cRight? I thought it will make it easier for me to run wild.\u201dRosalyn had dyed her hair and pupils brown with magic. On and Hong were standing next to her.\u201cLock, you should be able to use the physical strength of a wolf without transforming right?\u201d\u201cYes sir. It is possible.\u201dLock was standing there nervously as well. Next to him were the Black Dragon and Choi Han.Cale divided them into two teams. The Black Orb was already positioned by Choi Han yesterday, so the two teams each needed to locate and take care of the four bombs.\u201cMiss Rosalyn and Lock will be one team. Choi Han, Dragon, On, and Hong will be the other team.\u201dRosalyn had a confused expression on her face after hearing how Cale divided up the teams. Lock had the same expression on his face as well.\u201cWhat about you, young master Cale?\u201dChoi Han, the Black Dragon, On, and Hong all responded to the question.\u201cCale-nim is, a bit, uhm, his physical strength is\u2026\u201d\u201cWeak.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need him.\u201d\u201cHe is useless.\u201dAh.Rosalyn let out a gasp and looked toward Cale. Lock seemed to be quite surprised as well. However, Cale handed the items he borrowed from Billos to Choi Han, and confidently answered.\u201cI am weak and will only be baggage. I also need to prepare for the celebration as soon as the sun comes up, so it will be difficult for me to go with you.\u201dThey were going to use the short opening when the guards for the night shift switched with the day shift to enter the areas where the bombs were located and start to dismantle them. After that, while the Black Orb activates and causes a mana disturbance, they will all need to wait at their determined stations to observe the secret organizations members and the situation at the plaza.The birthday celebration was set to start at 9 am.Cale looked at his watch before speaking to the six of them again.\u201cAlright then, please head to work.\u201dHe then added on.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring back the dismantled magic bombs.\u201dRosalyn smiled and responded to Cale\u2019s statement.\u201cYou promised to give me one of them.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cShould be enough to pay for my services.\u201dIt was definitely enough. Cale looked toward the terrace, that was now being used more as a door than as a terrace, and opened the window. A cool night breeze filled the room as the six individuals quickly rushed out of Cale\u2019s room through the terrace.Some left with invisibility magic while others left with very fast speed. Cale watched them leave and thought to himself that they were all very strong.He was now left alone in the room.Ooooooooong-Cale slowly stroked the large shield and silver wings that appeared in front of him. Even if something unexpected happens, he would not die as long as he had this shield.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll use a tiny bit of its strength if I need to do so.\u201dCale patted the shield, that looked even more holy after having the heart crest engraved in it, and decided to use it without being noticed if there came the need to do so.Cale sat down on the couch and practiced using just a small amount of the shield\u2019s power, before noticing his reflection in the mirror.\u2018It should be fine.\u2019The blood-crazed mage. It was said that this person went into a frenzy by the color red. That was why, in the novel, the mage went crazy after seeing Rosalyn for the first time, saying that they needed to cut Rosalyn\u2019s head off to take her red hair and pupils.Cale brushed back his hair, that was an even brighter red than Rosalyn\u2019s hair, and started to think.\u2018What are the chances that I\u2019ll be in close proximity to that lunatic?\u2019Even if something like that happened, he just had to tell Choi Han to kill. Cale was not worried that his own head would get cut off. Cale relaxed and waited until Ron came to wake him up. Once Ron came at the usual time, Cale started to speak.\u201cToday will be your last day to serve me.\u201d\u201cI can do it again in a year.\u201dThat sounded terrible to Cale. He was planning on sending Ron to Choi Han immediately upon his return in a year. Cale was excited that he was getting rid of two baggages today, and started to speak with a light heart.\"Let's get ready.\"Cale made all the preparations and headed for the palace. All the participating nobles were scheduled to move together. The Black Dragon was going to come to the palace to report on the progress.After all of the preparations were completed, Cale got on a carriage in front of the residence\u2019s main gate. It was not the Henituse carriage, instead, he was going to be riding with someone else today.\u201cWhy did you want to go together?\u201dAmiru responded with a calm smile, as Cale asked the question while getting onto the carriage. Amiru had reached out and asked Cale to go with her today.She got right to the point, since Cale did the same without even greeting her first.\u201cYoung master Cale, what do you think about our territory building a naval base?\u201dCale started to smile.He had already received a letter from Eric letting him know that the tourism investment discussion did not go well. Eric said both Gilbert and Amiru were very disappointed. However, Amiru did not seem to be very disappointed. In fact, she seemed to have made up her mind about something else, something big.He looked toward her and started to speak.\u201cDidn\u2019t you already make up your mind, young lady Amiru?\u201dAmiru lightly nodded her head.\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t think it was a decision I could make on my own, so I contacted my mother. I plan to discuss it with young master Gilbert today as well.\u201dThe creation of a new military base. Something like that was not easy to accomplish. The money wasn\u2019t the issue, it was more about the relationship between powers within the territory that complicated things. Especially in times of peace, like right now.That was why the crown would have their eyes on the Northeast. The east was the only side with access to the ocean, but, most importantly, there was a balance of power in the East. It would also be difficult for the high-ranking nobles in the other regions to influence such a base as well.\u201cThen young lady Amiru\u2019s concern is that the crown\u2019s influence in your territory will get stronger because of this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAmiru gave a short answer, before continuing on.\u201cThat is why I asked for this time with you today.\u201dIt meant that she had something to discuss with him. Cale leaned on the back of the seat, and asked while in a comfortable position, as if he was in his own carriage.\u201cI am curious to know what your question is, but I think I need to tell you something first.\u201dHe knew why Amiru was here.\u201cAny decision regarding the funds of the Henituse family is made solely by my father. A trash like me has no decision-making powers.\u201dThe royal family would grant permission to build a naval base and invest huge sums of money. Naturally, the ownership of that naval base would then be passed on to the royal family.When building a military base in a territory that is outside the capital, there are a lot of different contracts between the crown and the nobility for ownership and other logistics involving the military base.There was a significant difference in manpower and funds between using the location as a military base than using the cliffs and the ocean for just tourism.Amiru and Gilbert\u2019s families were, honestly speaking, just average in wealth, lacking both the funds and the manpower to complete such a project.That was what Amiru wanted to prevent. That meant that there was only one method.Borrowing money from someone with a lot of money.\u201cIs that really the case?\u201dAmiru\u2019s smile seemed very intelligent. She had entered the crown prince\u2019s room during the wine party with Eric and Gilbert once Cale had left.It was then that she learned that the crown prince was interested in the shoreline, even though he was not interested in tourism. When she returned to her residence that night, she thought about Cale\u2019s words, and figured out his intentions.\u201cHis Highness the crown prince was wary of the Whipper Kingdom and the kingdoms to the north. I could tell based on our conversation with him, so I sought out some information from the information guild.\u201d\u2018I knew it.\u2019Cale could tell from Amiru\u2019s words that the crown prince and the royal family were aware of the fact that the Whipper Kingdom would soon face a civil war, and that the North was gathering their forces.\u2018But this was unexpected.\u2019Amiru\u2019s decision-making was on point. Amiru\u2019s family was not doing very well right now, relying a lot on Eric Wheelsman\u2019s family for help. It would have cost a lot to get information on foreign kingdoms through the information guild, but her willingness to spend that money to verify a single piece of information showed her personality.Amiru looked toward Cale, who was quietly listening, before continuing.\u201cI heard the Henituse territory is currently fortifying its walls. I believe the Henituse family will be interested in the military, since it is a territory that does not allow any kind of invasions.\u201dCale nodded his head at her statement and responded.\u201cI will speak to my father about it.\u201d\u201cWe will also send an official request as well.\u201dCale and Amiru looked at each other and smiled.If this naval base was to be created, the balance of power in the Northeast will shift to Cale, Eric, Amiru, and Gilbert\u2019s four families. If the Henituse family provided the funds to have a steady influence in the base, the Henituse family would receive multiple facets of support from the base.Amiru hesitated for a while, before continuing to speak.\u201cI am a bit worried because of the whirlpools, but there are paths that have been used for ages, and the whirlpool will actually serve as a defense to prevent foreign nations from invading. That is why I want to give it a go.\u201dWhirlpools. Cale prevented himself from smiling as soon as she mentioned the whirlpools.That whirlpools will soon be Cale\u2019s to utilize as he wishes.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to build a house on one of those cliffs and enjoy the sunset in the future?\u2019It would be difficult for him to stay in the Henituse estate once he hands control to Basen. Cale\u2019s plan was to hide in some remote corner during the war, and then head to Amiru or Gilbert\u2019s territory after the war was over to build a house on a cliff to relax while looking out at the sea.It would be a good location, since it was pretty close to the Henituse territory as well.\u201cThank you for your help, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cHahaha, to ask a trash for support. I have no power whatsoever, I am just delivering your message to my father.\u201dCale waved it off, and started to laugh. However, Amiru did not believe his words at all anymore.\u2018Amiru, you need to be cautious when you don\u2019t have power. However, you need to be bold if you want to earn power.\u2019That was what her mother, the head of the Ubarr territory, had said as she agreed on the naval base. Amiru was similar to her mother. That was why she worked to be bold, even while remaining cautious. This was her philosophy for dealing with people as well.\u201cIt is enough for you to deliver our message for us.\u201dAmiru reached her hand out to Cale, and Cale shook it. She then let go, before adding on.\u201cPlease come visit the Ubarr territory next time. There are actually a lot of interesting places to see.\u201d\u201cI will go if I have the chance to do so.\u201dThe Sound of the Wind.It will become Cale\u2019s fast feet, and, at the same time, give him control over a whirlwind that can be used for both offense and defense. Cale thought about the Ubarr coast, where that ancient power was located.\u201cI hope that the opportunity comes soon.\u201dThe carriage arrived at the palace as soon as he said that. Cale got off the carriage and looked around. The current time was 8 am.The staff would already be at the Plaza of Glory to prepare for the celebration. The Royal Knights will allow people to enter at 8:30 am, filling the plaza full of people.It will be a situation where it will be difficult for anyone to go in or out. The celebration will start thirty minutes after that, and Cale\u2019s group will start looking for the hidden picture starting at 8:30 am.Necklaces, bags, pendants.The magic bombs will be hiding in all sorts of shapes. Cale\u2019s group would find the people who have the bombs located on them. Well, it didn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t find them, since the answer will reveal itself.\u201cOh, you\u2019re here?\u201dCale received Eric and Gilbert\u2019s greeting, before standing next to them with Amiru.\"Everyone came early.\"\"Of course. We will start moving at 8:05 am.\u201dEric said that to Cale, while his eyes were sending Cale another message.Be still today as well.Cale nodded his head while looking into Eric\u2019s eyes, and reminded himself internally.\u2018I do not know anything.\u2019As soon as he thought that, the crown prince appeared in front of Cale. The nobles would follow behind the crown prince today.He then saw the person who arrived next to the crown prince, and covered his mouth with his hand. It was because he could not help but smirk.\u201cOh my lord.\u201d\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dEric\u2019s shocked gasp and the murmuring of the nobles filled the area. However, Cale did not care about any of that. Instead, he lowered his hand while looking forward. Cale made eye contact with the person next to the crown prince.The eldest son that had been pushed aside, Taylor Stan.He was standing on his own two legs next to the crown prince. Taylor stealthily motioned with his eyes once he made eye contact with Cale.At the same time, Cale could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head. The Black Dragon had entered the palace to give the current report of the situation.I am here.Cale slightly nodded his head, and the voice continued.We are dismantling all of the bombs that are currently stationed in the locations we found. We will dismantle them completely at 8:55 am, as planned.Everything seemed to be going as planned.I will be heading back now since we are busy, weak human. Use your shield if it seems like it\u2019ll hurt.Cale could not hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice after that. It seemed to have quickly returned to help the others. This Black Dragon surprisingly put all of his effort into his assignments whenever Cale gave him a task to complete. It made Cale want to keep ordering the Black Dragon around.\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be any reason for me to use the shield.\u2019Cale was thinking that he would not need to use the shield if things continued like this.\u201cAll preparations have been completed.\u201dOne of the knights shouted out loud, and the crown prince got on the Royal Parade Carriage and spoke to the nobles getting on the royal carriages behind him.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCale also got onto a royal carriage. The carriage soon started to move, and Cale sat there with his arms crossed while having a stiff expression on his face.\u201cNice to meet you all again.\u201dThe wheelchair-less Taylor greeted them.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Amiru Ubarr.\u201d\u201c\u2026Nice to meet you.\u201dTaylor Stan, Young lady Amiru, and Venion\u2019s lackey Neo Tolz ended up in the same carriage as them. Cale was wondering whether the crown prince purposely put them together in the same carriage.It was Cale\u2019s turn to introduce himself, but Cale just quietly sat there and looked out the carriage window. A trash was allowed to be this rude. He sat there with his arms crossed and looked toward the Plaza of Glory.The chaos was not far away.1.

Cale looked toward Neo, whose legs were shaking, and internally clicked his tongue. Neo seemed to be frantic and full of concern. The majority of the nobles looked chaotic.\u2018Venion\u2019s face was a mess too.\u2019Cale recalled Venion Stan\u2019s face that he peeked at before getting on the carriage. Venion was full of rage.Who would have ever expected this?Taylor Stan, the eldest son of the Stan family that was pushed aside, was walking on his own two feet without a wheelchair. Furthermore, a person from the Stan family was standing next to the crown prince, Alberu. Nobody could have expected such development.\u2018He managed to trade for the Healing Star.\u2019Cale was curious about what Taylor and Cage traded with the crown prince for the Healing Star, but he did not look toward Taylor.Neo Tolz was sitting there shaking his leg, without even looking at Taylor. At that moment, Amiru started to speak.\u201cYoung master Taylor, have your legs completely healed?\u201dThe cautiously stated question directly asked the question that everyone was thinking about. Taylor started to smile as he responded.\u201cIt was a blessing from heaven. It is completely healed.\u201d\u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dAhem, mm.Neo Tolz let out some fake coughs before looking back and forth between Taylor\u2019s face and Taylor\u2019s legs. He then cautiously started to speak.\u201cYoung master Taylor, will you be returning to the Marquis\u2019s estate now that your legs have healed?\u201dThe biggest reason Taylor was pushed aside was because his legs became paralyzed. Neo and the other nobles were probably curious as to whether or not Taylor would return to the estate to fight for the successor position once again.Especially since Neo was one of Venion\u2019s lackeys.Taylor looked toward Neo, and started to speak.\u201cReturn?\u201dIt was a gentle voice, but there was firmness and coldness toward Neo hidden within Taylor\u2019s voice.\u201cThat has always been my home. Isn\u2019t it obvious that I belong there?\u201dNeo shriveled up even more at the coldness in Taylor\u2019s voice. However, Cale chose not to even look at them. Cale could see Taylor\u2019s reflection through the window every so often.Of course, Taylor didn\u2019t make it obvious to the others, making it look like he was just looking out the window like Cale as well.Cale could read the message Taylor was trying to send him when their eyes met.\u2018Young master Cale! I want to tell you everything! It is a very interesting story.\u2019\u00a0[1]Cale was still stoic after seeing Taylor\u2019s sparkling gaze. Cale just hoped for Taylor to take over the Marquis position and prevent any harm from happening within his territory.That was why he did not want to talk to Taylor. However, an opportunity soon appeared for Taylor and Cale to chat.\u201cAhem, then I will step out now.\u201dAs soon as the carriage arrived outside the Plaza of Glory, Neo Tolz rushed out of the carriage to get away from them. Since he made it very obvious that he worked for Venion, this was a really awkward place for him to be. He probably also wanted to report Taylor\u2019s current situation to Venion right away.\u201cYoung master Cale, I will come back with young master Eric.\u201dAmiru was worried that Cale might start something if he ran into the other Northeastern nobles, who happened to be in a carriage with Eric and Gilbert, and left alone to bring Eric and Gilbert over.\u2018Nothing should happen since young master Taylor and Young master Cale don\u2019t have any relationship.\u2019\u2018Based on young master Cale\u2019s personality, he will not start a conversation with anyone.\u2019That was what Amiru was thinking as she quickly moved to find Eric and Gilbert.That resulted in Cale having to receive Taylor\u2019s bright smile.\u201cFinally, only the two of us are left.\u201dIt was something Cale did not like to hear. He made that feeling completely visible on his face, but Taylor seemed to find that to be funny. Taylor quietly laughed, before throwing a straight at Cale.\u201cI got my leg fixed by promising to become the head of the Marquis\u2019s estate.\u201d\u201cDid you promise your loyalty?\u201d\u201cNo. I made a deal.\u201dCale nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Congratulations on your healed legs.\u201dCale then turned away from Taylor, as if he had nothing else to say. Taylor found that reaction to be very fitting of Cale\u2019s personality, and took a small envelope out of his pocket and handed it to Cale.\u201cThis is the contents of our deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026There is no need to give this to me.\u201dCale had a stoic expression, and Taylor responded.\u201cIt\u2019ll be good for you to know, young master Cale.\u201dHe then threw another straight at Cale.\u201cCage will be excommunicated.\u201d\u201cIs it because she does whatever she wants?\u201d\u201cIt is. She is very happy about it.\u201dCage was finally starting on the path of the crazy priestess. She will now progress like the excommunicated priestess who is seen as a brave priestess by others, like in the novel.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dCale could see Taylor happily nodding his head at his words. Taylor then started to frown, like all of his emotions were crashing against him all at once like a whirlpool, and started to speak.\u201cThis is just the beginning. We will be victorious. Right, young master Cale?\u201d\u2018Why is he including me in their victory?\u2019Cale was curious about that, but decided to answer his question for now.\u201cYou will be victorious.\u201d\u201cThank you very much. Then I will get off first.\u201dTaylor got up and looked down at his legs, before saying goodbye to Cale and getting off.\u201cThe three of us should drink together after our victory.\u201d\u201cThe Henituse wine is delicious.\u201dTaylor finally opened the carriage door at Cale\u2019s words and left. Cale immediately opened the envelope once he was alone.He then ripped it up.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe lightly clicked his tongue and shoved the note deep inside his inner pocket. There really was a secret to the crown prince\u2019s birth. Cale shook his head and stepped out of the carriage.\u201cCale.\u201dCale turned his head at Eric\u2019s calling. He could see the full Plaza of Glory behind their shoulders.\u201cYoung master Cale, let us go. It is our turn to enter the plaza.\u201dIn the novel, Choi Han was curious about these people, who had a spot higher than the normal citizens of the kingdom. Today, Cale was going to that same spot. However, he was still at the bottom compared to the royal family and the holy priests.Cale looked toward the bell tower at the entrance of the plaza. The bell tower had a giant clock on it.The current time was 8:25 am. It was time for the nobles and priests to enter. The knights started to prevent any more citizens from entering to create room for the nobility.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCale pushed Eric and the others in front of him and started to walk. He could see all of the people in the plaza as he got closer. There were so many people that he couldn\u2019t even tell how many people were there. However, they were not completely stuffed like sardines. That was how large the Plaza of Glory was, and the fact that the crown was limiting the number of people helped out as well. In response, some people were in shops near the plaza and roofs of buildings nearby to try to get a glimpse of the king\u2019s celebration.\u201cYoung master Cale, is this your first time at the Plaza of Glory?\u201dCale leisurely nodded his head at Gilbert\u2019s question.\u201cYes. I briefly passed through on my carriage, but it is my first time seeing all of it.\u201dCale looked around the plaza as he said that.The tea shop to the South.The inn to the West.A flower shop to the East.The top of the Ceramist Association building to the North.These were the four places Cale focused on as he looked around.\u201cThe plaza is pretty large.\u201dCale verified the locations the magic bombs were positioned. At the same time, he looked toward the fountain to the south. A young boy was waving a flag, like he was trying to welcome the king. That young boy was Lock.\u2018Things are going as planned.\u2019Cale knew that Choi Han and the Black Dragon would be watching him right now, and looked toward the Bell Tower.The current time was 8:30 am.\u201cWe are opening up a path now.\u201dThe knights closed up all entrances to allow the nobles to enter. At the same time, Cale snapped his fingers.Snap.It was a simple gesture that nobody would question.Lock disappeared as soon as it happened. It was time to find the hidden items. Of course, it wasn\u2019t necessary at all.\u2018The answer will appear at 9:01 am.\u2019However, it was easier if they knew the answer in advance. Furthermore, since Cale didn\u2019t need to move, it was fine to look for these hidden items.\u201cEverybody please take a seat over here.\u201dThe seats were arranged with everyone\u2019s names posted in specific seats. The king and the royal family was not at the plaza just yet. Even the crown prince, who came with the nobles, was not out yet.Cale arrived at his seat, and started to frown.\u201cWe seem to run into each other a lot, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cThat does seem to be the case, young master Taylor.\u201dIt was the same as during the feast. Cale sat down next to Taylor, and looked down at the people below the platform. He then looked toward the Bell Tower.He recalled the story in the novel.The single location that Choi Han managed to find a bomb in the novel was not one of the locations this time. There were already many changes to the story.However, at least there should not be anyone who dies by the crumbling of the buildings, unlike in the novel.The Mana Disturbance Tool was buried underneath the Bell Tower.The current time was 8:40 am. Cale turned to his left after hearing Eric\u2019s voice.\u201cCale. Be still. Okay?\u201d\u201cHyung-nim.\u201dEric became nervous after hearing the tone Cale used to call out to him. Cale, who used to enjoy wearing fancy clothes and showing off until just two years ago, was suddenly only wearing dark clothes, and had a completely different demeanor about him.\u201cI will be very still today. I plan to do nothing at all.\u201dEric was captivated by Cale\u2019s voice, and subconsciously nodded his head. Cale seemed to be satisfied with this reaction, as he laughed and looked at the clock again.8:45 am. He could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice. The dragon was looking at him as Cale expected.15 minutes left.Dragons were really capable of everything. There was nothing their magic could not accomplish. Cale praised the Black Dragon internally as he got up from his seat.\u201cThe stars of the Crossman family, our royal family, are now entering!\u201dOnly one entrance to the plaza was open at this time. The crown prince was in the lead, the second and third prince flanked his sides, and the other princes and princesses walked in behind them.A group of individuals with beautiful blonde hair entered the plaza. This was the royal family that was blessed by the Sun God, the pride of the Roan Kingdom.Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-The cheering of the citizens filled the plaza. It was so loud that it felt like the ground was shaking. Cale remembered the words of the Black Dragon.\u2018The crown prince\u2019s hair and eyes are brown.\u2019Brown was known as the most average color hair and eyes. Cale looked toward the royal family, and lightly clapped. And then, it was finally 8:50 am.\u201cHis Highness, King Zed Crossman, the sun of the Roan Kingdom, is now entering!\u201dWooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-The healthy 50-year-old king appeared in the plaza in his parade carriage. Cale was watching the king, before moving his gaze away to another spot in the plaza. He could see a flower pot on top of the Ceramist Association building to the north. The current time was 8:55 am.\u2018They dismantled it.\u2019Cale started to smile.Rosalyn, The Black Dragon, On, and Hong will now hide within the crowd in the plaza.King Zed was slowly heading toward the plaza from far off in the distance. Zed Crossman had risen to the position of king at the age of 20 after the former king\u2019s sudden death. He utilized this time of peace to his advantage, killing off all of his siblings to solidify his position of power.Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-The fanfare for the king was still very loud. King Zed passed through the plaza entrance and headed to the highest platform. Cale just calmly watched this all happen.There was a special platform for the king in front of the Bell Tower.The king and the queen waved to the crowd, before walking up to the platform. The queen stood in front of her seat as King Zed went up to the magic vocal amplifier.Cale looked at the clock again.Current time was 8:58 am.The King lifted up his hand, and the cheers slowly died down. Finally, once the plaza was completely quiet, the king started to speak.\u201cIt has already been 30 years since this king has received the blessing of the sun to rule over this kingdom.\u201dThe king seemed very happy. Unfortunately, it was now 9 am.\u201cHuh?\u201dCale could hear Eric\u2019s confused voice.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dCale then heard Taylor\u2019s anxious voice. Cale leisurely raised his head to look at the top of the Bell Tower.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dThe mumblings of the crowd started to get louder. King Zed looked behind him, and then moved his gaze up the Bell Tower. Cale looked at the top of the Bell Tower and started to smile.King Zed started to shout.\u201cWho are you?!\u201dThe knights and mages headed to the Bell Tower. The citizens started to get nervous about what was going on. They had no choice. A person appeared on top of the Bell Tower, and then more people in black attires started to appear on top of the buildings nearby as well.\u201cGet down this instant!\u201d\u201cEverybody, head up to the top of the buildings now!\u201dCale heard the voices of the knights nearby, and looked toward the man standing on top of the Bell Tower with black attire and a mask. It was the blood-crazy mage, Redika.\u00a0[2]\u2018I was worried this would be different than the novel as well.\u2019If Redika did not show up, he would have needed the Black Dragon to reverse the flow of mana coming to the mana bombs in order to locate the hidden Redika, and allow Choi Han to kill him.Cale was relieved that he would not need to do that, and remembered the description in the novel.Redika\u2019s hand became covered in a red-colored mana. This punk was unique, in that people could see the color of his mana, even though he was a mage. He then swung his hand and announced as he had in the novel.<\u201dShould be fun.\u201d>\u201cShould be fun.\u201dA chilling voice that sounded like metal screeching against one another, filled the plaza. Then, the red mana shot out to different spots in the plaza.That moment was exactly 9:01 am.Oooooooooong-A vibration started from underneath the Bell Tower.Beeeeeeep-Beeeeeeeep-Magic devices started to go off in multiple locations. The red mana that was flying toward the detonation devices inside the magic bombs suddenly lost strength and started to spin aimlessly in position.It was the result of the mana disturbance.Then, it happened inside the plaza as well.Beeeeeeeep-Four spots started to ring in the plaza.\u201cFound it.\u201dCale\u2019s quiet voice was drowned out by the alarm of the magic devices.Someone within the area of those four alarms would have the magic bomb on them.As Cale expected, the magic bombs had an alarm to sound that there was an error.Cale could see Choi Han, Rosalyn, and Lock heading toward the four locations.10 minutes. Even if they could not manage to dismantle the bombs in 10 minutes, they had plenty of time to move the bombs to the mountain in the rear to make it go off without hurting anyone. It was possible because of Rosalyn and the Black Dragon.Found one human.Cale started to smile after hearing the invisible Black Dragon\u2019s report.The 10 minutes had just started.1. Quite a lot of content to get out of a single gaze\u20262. Apparently, it is a guy. Chapter 32 updated to show HE instead of SHEPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the person the Black Dragon determined to be in possession of the magic bomb.Cale could see the necklace on the person\u2019s neck.\u2018That must be it.\u2019Cale could see Choi Han ripping off the person\u2019s necklace. At the same time, Cale\u2019s body was jerked. Someone had pulled Cale\u2019s arm.\u201cCale!\u201dIt was Eric Wheelsman. Cale slowly looked around him, starting with the top of the Bell Tower.\u201cHahahaha-\u201cThe blood crazy mage Redika was laughing.Wiiiiiiiiing.A loud noise appeared alongside the noise of scratching metal, combining to create a terrifying screech.\u201cYour Highness! Please get to a safe spot!\u201dThe Royal Knights and some mages were next to the royal family and the king in order to help them escape. Cale first looked toward the crown prince. His hair was still blonde.\u2018Was it not magic using mana?\u2019((Did another dragon dye his hair? Or is it a different type of strength?)) [This originally had <<>> but that doesn't seem to make it show]Cale remembered what the Black Dragon had said in the past. Cale decided to stop thinking about it, and continued to look around.Half of the remaining Royal Knights and mages were working to calm the crowd and find the Mana Disturbance Tool, while the other half was rushing toward the secret organization. Redika, who had been laughing for a while now, started to speak.\u201cThis is annoying\u201dWith that, all of the secret organization members other than Redika started to launch long-range attacks. Spears, daggers, and throwing knives; all sorts of attacks started to pour down upon the knights.Boom!Wiiiiiiiiiiiing-Beeeeeeeep.Cale found it very loud. At the same time, the Black Dragon continued its report.One more human.And another.9:04 am. This was the third person so far.\u201cCale! We should go as well! We should go!\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, hurry up!\u201dCale looked toward Eric, Amiru, Gilbert, and Taylor. They had all quickly gathered around him. Eric was looking around with a chaotic expression on his face. Cale followed his lead and looked around as well.\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry up and let us go!\u201d\u201cLet us out right now!\u201dThe nobles were fighting to get out of the plaza as quickly as possible. Of course, there were a couple calm ones as well. However, It was different underneath the platform.\u201cWhy are you blocking the exit!\u201d\u201cOpen up a path!\u201dThe citizens were screaming for the knights to open the door and rushing toward the exit. The knights and soldiers shouted back at the citizens.\u201cPlease calm down!\u201d\u201cPlease wait just a moment!\u201d\u201cYou expect us to wait in a situation like this? Get out of our way!\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?! The nobles are trying to leave right now! Let us leave as well!\u201dCale looked for hands being raised in the air in the midst of that chaos.\u201cW, what are you doing?!\u201dChoi Han pulled a bag off of an old man\u2019s shoulder and thrust his arm into the air. This was the third person. Cale turned his head to look around at the people around him.The door for the nobles and priests was already open, with many nobles and priests quickly heading out as fast as they could. It looked more peaceful because there were fewer people than the gate for the citizens down below, but it was still chaotic with each person trying to get out faster than the other.That was why.\u201cWhat a mess.\u201dIt was a complete mess. Eric was frantically pacing around, so Cale put his hand on Eric\u2019s shoulder to calm him down. He then held onto Eric\u2019s shoulder tightly.\u201cHyung-nim.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCale continued to speak once the pain snapped Eric out of his chaotic state.\u00a0[1]\u201cCalm down.\u201dEric calmed down after seeing Cale\u2019s calm demeanor. He then looked around. The knights were fighting against these unknown assailants while the royal family was in the process of escaping. The citizens looked to be in a state of chaos. As Eric absorbed all of the events going on around him and turned back to look at Cale, Cale started to speak.\u201cThat is more like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you. I feel like my head has cleared.\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders and turned away. Gilbert and Amiru had come back to their senses after hearing what Cale had said to Eric, and were looking at Cale as well. Even if they tried to head for the noble\u2019s exit gate right now, they would just be swept up in the chaos. The head families of the other regions were busy gathering their people and calming them down while trying to figure out a path of escape.Gilbert watched some of the other nobles before looking around. The other nobles from the Northeast region were headed toward them. They were all looking at Eric, but Eric and Gilbert were looking at Cale.\u201c\u2026What the\u2026\u201dCale looked toward Taylor. Taylor was different from the others. Taylor\u2019s concern right now was that the citizens\u2019 gate was still not fully open. The gate was opening very slowly, most likely so that they could control the flow of people running out.Taylor was a very altruistic and good person. That was why he was more worried about the citizens than himself. Cale looked toward Eric and started to speak. Eric had the qualifications to be the leader of this group, after all.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter hearing Cale\u2019s words, Eric nodded his head and led the Northeast nobles to the gate. Cale looked at the clock.9:08 am. The mages were busy getting rid of the mana disturbance. The Mana Disturbance Tool was going to run out in a few minutes. It only lasted this long because there were a lot of people in the plaza adding to the chaos.One more removed.Now it was four. There were just two more remaining. Two minutes. Cale thought that they should have enough time.Redika\u2019s red mana balls were still spinning around in the air. The moment the Mana Disturbance Tool stops working, those mana balls will immediately head for the magic bombs and detonate them.Cale looked at the clock on the Bell Tower before starting to walk. The Black Dragon made another report at this time.That is all.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, what is wrong?\u201dTaylor, who had been walking next to Cale, looked at Cale with confusion, but Cale did not have time to focus on him.\u2018There are only four?\u2019Cale remembered that there were a total of 10 bombs in the novel. Had it changed? Cale stopped walking and looked around. The Mana Disturbance Tool had a range of a large mountain. If the magic bombs were buried elsewhere, the alarm would have gone off at that location.But the alarms for the high-grade devices only went off inside the plaza.Did the number of bombs change because the story has changed?9:09 am came and went, and only a few seconds were left until 9:10 am. One of the mage\u2019s amplified voice rang out in the plaza.\u201cActivate Mana Stability Magic!\u201dAs soon as he said that, mages from eight different directions chanted a spell at the same time. Eight magic balls of light shot up into the sky.Boom-They blew up in the air and started to spread like a thin tent. And then, finally.Wiiiiiiiiing-The noise started to quiet down. Mana was starting to become stable once again. 9:09 am and 55 seconds.Cale could see four items being shot up into the sky at that time. It was Rosalyn and the Black Dragon using their magic. Those four items followed the stabilized flow of mana and flew toward the mountains to the south of the capital.For these two, who were extremely sensitive to mana, something like this was a breeze.The citizens blankly watched as these four items flew like shooting stars toward the mountain with harsh terrain that prevented people from traversing through.\u201cMana Stability Complete!\u201d9:10 am and 5 seconds. The mage shouted out loud, and Redika\u2019s red mana balls started to chase behind the items flying toward the mountain. As the red mana balls finally came into contact with the four items\u2026Booooooom-!A large explosion occurred in the sky. It was so bright that it temporarily blinded everyone who was looking at it. A large pillar of black smoke soon followed and rushed up into the sky. Even though the mountain was far to the south of the plaza, a large gust of wind rushed toward the crowd in the plaza.The plaza instantly became silent. The mages\u2019 expressions turned completely pale. It was because they realized the identity and purpose of the red mana balls that started to fly as soon as they stabilized the mana.\u201c\u2026Those were magic bombs.\u201dTaylor Stan muttered those words in shock. Any noble who had the slightest knowledge of magic would know that only one item was capable of having such a destructive force.A magic bomb.Even the king and some of the princes, who were retreating, stopped moving. Everybody could not help but think about how those items had shot up from within the crowd before starting to fly toward the mountain.Cale brushed his hair that was a mess from the gust of wind.\u2018I guess there were only four bombs.\u2019Nobody had died.We saved them all.Cale could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head. Cale just quietly listened to the dragon. The once chaotic plaza was now very calm. No, it was almost depressing now.The people were probably thinking about the terrible scene that could have happened in the plaza. They were probably swept up in their emotions of both relief and fear.I saved them!The Black Dragon sounded very happy and excited. This was the first time that this young Black Dragon, who had been wishing for its own death after living a life of despair, had saved something with its own strength.Cale thought about the Black Dragon\u2019s emotions as he moved his gaze to the location the magic bombs had shot up into the air. The knights and mages were heading to that location.However, Cale\u2019s group had already left the scene. They then used the invisibility magic device Cale had borrowed from Billos to hide in the farthest corner of the plaza.\u2018Then Choi Han will chase after the mage to kill him.\u2019Cale looked toward the top of the Bell Tower. Eric and the rest had already stopped moving. They were able to figure out from what the mages were saying that the magic bombs were supposed to explode in the plaza, but ended up exploding in the mountain far away to the south.How could they not?Redika said it himself from the top of the Bell Tower.\u2018Unfortunately, nobody died. Why did they go off over there?\u2019Redika continued to speak in that metal screeching voice.\u201cGuess this one was a failure.\u201dThe King started to shout toward Redika.\u201cWhat are you doing? Who are you? Do you think you will be fine after attempting to commit such a deed?!\u201dKing Zed\u2019s response changed after realizing that it was not just an attack that was planned. The fact that they were trying to detonate magic bombs directly next to the royal family and nobles was no different than declaring war against this kingdom.But Cale had a different thought regarding Redika\u2019s statement.\u2018\u2026, \u2018This one,\u2019 was a failure?\u2019Cale\u2019s expression stiffened, worried that there was something else as well. His changed expression made Taylor, who was approaching Cale to speak thinking that things were now okay, stop moving. He then looked toward the top of the Bell Tower like Cale was doing.\u201cOh well then.\u201dThe metal screeching voice rang throughout the plaza. Redika shouted toward the king and the knights without caring about the fact that the mages used levitation magic to approach him.Snap.He snapped his fingers and two people appeared next to him.These two were just wearing black attires without the red star and white star symbol on their chest. They were each wearing a backpack.Cale started to frown.\u2018Those are the remaining bombs.\u2019Those two people were most likely members of the assassin team of the secret organization. They were people whose lives did not matter. Cale now understood the location of the remaining two bombs.The two of them each took out three scrolls and ripped them at the same time.Shield, acceleration, and combustion.\u201cGo.\u201dRedika gave the order and the two people, whose bodies were now burning, rushed toward the citizens below the Bell Tower. Redika shot out two balls of red mana toward the two people.\u201cS, stop them!\u201dMagic bombs were guaranteed to go off if they were not dismantled.Unfortunately, Redika was closer to these two people than anybody else. The red mana reached the backpacks of the two suicide bombers.The bombs were going to detonate soon.The two people, who had used acceleration magic, were rushing toward the plaza at a fast speed.One of the two rushed toward the royal family while the other\u2026\u2018He\u2019s coming this way.\u2019Rushed toward the nobles.All of this happened in less than 10 seconds.I\u2019m coming!Cale raised his hand as he heard the dragon\u2019s voice.\u201cAaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cR, run away!\u201d\u201cDodge!\u201dIt was too late to dodge. You were not going to get out of the bomb\u2019s range simply by running for a few seconds.\u201cC, Cale, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, hurry!\u201dEric, Taylor, Gilbert, and Amiru did not run away right away like the others. They were trying to save Cale as well. However, it was all too late.Cale was extremely annoyed. If he started to run and the bomb went off, he would probably lose an arm. However, the Vitality of the Heart would help him recover his arm.However, the people who were trying to protect him would lose at least a limb no matter how fast they ran. They would also not be able to recover from their injuries as he could.Rather than allowing something like that to happen\u2026\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u201dCale let out a deep sigh and opened his palm up into the air. It was time to change plans. At that moment, Rosalyn, who was teleported through the Black Dragon\u2019s magic, created a two-layer shield around herself and Cale.At the same time\u2026\u201cExplode!\u201dRedika shouted out with joy.\u201cHuh?\u201dRosalyn had a blank expression as she stared at what was going on in front of her.The suicide bomber who was headed their way was surrounded by large wings. A silver shield shot up to the sky as if it was protecting the people in the plaza, and the wings of the shield surrounded the bomber. It looked like the shield and the wings were completely swallowing up the bomber.And a strong shield that was not very visible because of the silver light surrounded the silver shield.I will block it as well.The Black Dragon announced in Cale\u2019s head.A holy looking person with a silver shield was standing underneath the sun. A strand of silver light connected the red-haired man with the shield in the sky. Cale started to curse as his hair fluttered from the gust of wind.\u201c\u2026Fuck!\u201dAnd then the bomb went off.1. (PR: OUR YOUNG MASTER CAUSED PAIN TO SOMEONE?!?!?! I\u2019m so proud.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everybody crouched down and covered their heads with their hands.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cUgh. My, my arm!\u201d\u201cUgggggh!\u201dThe screams of people getting injured or killed filled the plaza. And then\u2026Swiiiiiiish-A gust that sounded like rain brushed by over the heads of the people. The people at the center of the plaza got covered by the dust from the ground, while the people by the fountains got drenched by the fountain water before they all slowly raised their heads.The first thing they saw was something going toward the North. None of the royal family was hurt because a shield was created to protect them, but the people around them were hurt.These were the people who arrived at the plaza earlier than anybody else to wait for the king. In addition, there were the servants, the lower ranking officials, the lower tiered knights, and the mages who did not have enough time to launch their shields.Some of them were injured while others were dead. The black smoke made it impossible to see the royal family\u2019s blonde hair.The people still alive all raised their heads up. They then looked toward where the nobles and the citizens had been standing.Claaang-The silver shield started to slowly break like pieces of glass. The silver wings crumbled down as well. As they started to crumble, black smoke started to come out of the encirclement. There definitely was a person inside, however, nothing, not even a piece of flesh or even a drop of blood, could be seen.Everybody looking felt chills going down their body. This helped them understand the strength of the explosion.Their gazes naturally turned toward a single location. It was the end of that silver strand of light.\u201cYoung master Cale!\u201dRosalyn quickly started to support Cale back up, as one of Cale\u2019s knees gave out and he was starting to fall. Rosalyn looked back and forth between Cale and the silver shield that was slowly dissipating. She then looked toward the royal family. These were two very strong explosions.Of course, Rosalyn knew that the Black Dragon\u2019s shield had absorbed the majority of the explosion, but it was still true that Cale\u2019s silver shield had done something amazing.That meant that the recoil from it would be severe as well.Rosalyn grabbed onto Cale\u2019s arm to keep him up and called out to him. Cale was standing there with his head down.\u201cYoung master Cale, are you okay? Young master Cale!\u201dHe then started to think.\u2018Damn, it hurts.\u2019Cale had lowered the strength of the silver shield after seeing the Black Dragon launch a shield of its own right before the explosion. Thanks to that, the recoil was not as severe. However, his palm was still throbbing. Cale, well, Kim Rok Soo, tended to exaggerate when it came to pain.Even a small amount of pain was still painful. He tried to raise his head back up.\u201cCale-nim!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dCale could hear the voices calling out to him getting closer. He then raised his head.\u201cCale, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ok\u2026cough!\u201d\u201cB, blood\u2026\u2026!\u201dEric\u2019s face turned pale, and he almost fell backward.However, Cale started to feel better after coughing up that small amount of blood.\u2018The Vitality of the Heart really is good.\u2019The pain in his body disappeared, and his body started to settle back to normal at a very fast rate. In fact, Cale\u2019s body became healthier than ever as the, \u2018Vitality of the Heart,\u2019 started to go to work.A refreshing feeling that was similar to the feeling he had when he was able to sleep peacefully because Ron had gone on vacation surrounded Cale. He then slowly closed his eyes and started to feel his body.\u2018Arms and legs are still attached. My palm was throbbing a bit earlier, but even a paper cut hurt more than that. My body is healthier than ever after that single cough.\u2019Cale felt like he understood why the heroes never threw the ancient powers away, even if they were not very useful. There were benefits to using these ancient powers. Using it hurt less than he expected, and now he was feeling great.Cale started to smile in satisfaction.As he did that, the people surrounding him became a mess.\u201cYou think this is funny right now? Stop laughing!\u201dCale opened his eyes after hearing Taylor\u2019s shocked and sorrowful voice. He had opened his eyes after checking his body and realizing that everything felt great. However, the sun was shining too brightly that he had to squint.\u201cStop trying to open your eyes either!\u201d\u2018What\u2019s going on with him?\u2019Cale looked toward Taylor in confusion as he sat down with Rosalyn\u2019s support. A noble should not do something like this, but he felt like it would be okay given the situation. Cale pretty much just plopped down on the ground without caring about what people thought of him.The Black Dragon continued to yap away in his ear.Weak human, you cannot die! You are too weak! If you die, I will destroy everything! I will kill everyone, destroy everything, and once everything is gone, including your corpse, I will kill myself as well!The Black Dragon seemed to be concerned, but the words coming out of its mouth were pretty vicious. Cale started to frown from the content of the Black Dragon\u2019s words.\u201cYoung master Cale, we will call a priest over!\u201d\u201cI will go with you!\u201dAmiru and Gilbert said that before rushing toward the priest who was entering through the gate. They did not care about their messed up dress and suit. Seeing them rushing forward like that, Cale did not have the courage to say that nothing was hurting.\u2018Doesn\u2019t hurt to be checked out. I also need to pretend to be hurt.\u2019It was great for Cale if the priest showed up. Eric Wheelsman was standing next to Cale and glaring at the other Northeastern nobles nearby, as well, as the other nobles from other factions, to prevent them from approaching.Cale was not looking at this, as he was looking at a discussion that may create some more chaos.\u201c\u2026Please get out of my way.\u201d\u201cNo way. Civilians are not allowed inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026Civilian? Who came up with crap like that?\u201dChoi Han was talking to the knight in charge of the nobles with a cold gaze in his eyes. Cale had told Choi Han not to come forward, no matter what. Cale started to frown and waved away Choi Han, who had gone against his order.Choi Han saw Cale\u2019s reaction, so he bit down on his lips before bowing his head.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u2018I told him not to come forward, but it\u2019s not something to apologize about.\u2019Cale then saw Lock, as well as On and Hong on Lock\u2019s shoulders, behind Choi Han. Cale smiled to signal to them that he was fine, and turned away from them as they all seemed completely lost.\u201c\u2026Young master Cale, are you okay?\u201dCale nodded his head at Rosalyn\u2019s question and wiped away the blood at the corner of his lips.\u201cYes. I am absolutely fine.\u201dCale\u2019s movement seemed normal as he wiped away the blood that was as red as his hair. However, Rosalyn had just seen what Cale had done. Could a princess like her take the same action? She quietly started to mumble to herself.\u201c\u2026I really can\u2019t figure you out.\u201dHowever, she just silently stared at Cale once he turned to look back at her. Cale\u2019s expression became serious. It was because he realized that she was not looking at him, but past him. He then followed her gaze and turned around.\u201cAh.\u201dThe blood drinking mage. He was now floating in the air as he looked down on them.\u201cI never expected something like this to happen. But this is pretty fun as well.\u201dThe blood crazy mage Redika said that as he looked toward the royal family. The mages once again used levitation magic, and even the capital\u2019s guard rushed over to aim their arrows toward Redika.Redika then turned his gaze toward the nobles.He made eye contact with Cale, and then noticed Rosalyn next to Cale as well. Although her hair was dyed brown right now, Redika should recognize Rosalyn, whom he saw at the Blue Wolf Village. The metal screeching voice rang through the plaza once again.\u201cWow, so many different colors of blood that I like!\u201dMany of the mages launched attack magics toward Redika.\u201cAttack!\u201dIt was not visible because of the mask, but Redika\u2019s eyes curled up like a crescent moon underneath.\u201cI want to put them in my display case.\u201dCale\u2019s expression stiffened, and he accidentally let out his thoughts.\u201cIs he crazy?\u201dUsually, crazy characters like this end up dying quickly. Cale thought about that, and looked toward Choi Han.Choi Han nodded his head and disappeared.Naturally, Choi Han was moving to capture and kill that mage. However, Choi Han was not moving toward Redika.Redika looked toward the king as the magic attacks were about to hit him, and started to speak.\u201cThen see you next time!\u201dHe then disappeared. Not only that, he took everyone who came with him as well. This bastard\u2019s specialty was teleportation magic. There was no way for the people attacking him to know where they went. However, the novel mentioned where Redika teleported to after disappearing from the plaza.Choi Han, On, Hong, and Lock all headed there earlier.If that really is where Redika and the secret organization members teleported to, they will most likely die by Choi Han\u2019s hands.\u2018I\u2019m just worried that Choi Han will go berserk.\u2019That was why Cale had sent On, Hong, and Lock with Choi Han. The three of them would be able to help Choi Han remain rational. Choi Han was weak against young and weak existences.Cale stood up from the seat.The king was heading back up to the podium, and the people in the plaza started to chatter once again. The villains had disappeared, but they left behind a cruel sight. The king was heading to the podium to try to calm the crowd.\u201cI will do my best to get revenge for this cruel and terrible incident. That is why I want all of you to follow the orders of the crown and focus on calming yourselves and getting rest. We will push this celebration back.\u201dCale turned away from the king to look at Rosalyn. Originally, she was supposed to hide her presence today, but she had revealed herself for Cale.\u2018She probably stepped in because the Black Dragon cannot reveal himself.\u2019Rosalyn started to smile after making eye contact with Cale. She then mouthed a word to respond to Cale\u2019s gaze.\u2018Secret.\u2019Cale started to smile as well. She really was someone who was on the same wavelength as him.Cale had given the six people in his crew some instructions before the day began.First, the dragon and the beast tribe trio would not have their identities revealed, no matter what.That was the most important task.Second, even if Choi Han and Rosalyn end up being recognized, they will just say that they happened to be here by coincidence. This was only possible because the crown had no way to know about the magic bombs hidden in different locations in the plaza, and because there was no way to prove the identities of who got rid of the bombs that were shot up into the air.Third, they will not cause each other harm.Cale and Rosalyn knew what they both had to do from that single moment of eye contact. That was why Cale brushed the dirt off of his clothes and fixed it up.He then started to smile toward the person walking toward him.\u201cYoung master Cale, are you okay?\u201dThe priest was huffing, as if he was dragged over here by Amiru and Gilbert. Rosalyn stepped back, and Cale pushed his hand out to the priest and started to speak.\u201cIt hurts a lot. Please take a look.\u201dCale then noticed that the crown prince was heading toward him. The crown prince would definitely recognize Rosalyn and probably already saw her two-layered magic. He would then question the relationship between Cale and Rosalyn.In a situation like this, it was better to suck out everything he could from this situation. That was why he started to speak in a voice that was loud enough for the priest and the nobles around him to hear.\u201cIt really is hard to protect something.\u201d\u2018If I had to reveal my card and use my ancient power, I should take anything and everything I can from this situation.\u2019It was not Cale\u2019s style to sacrifice himself just for fame and no material gain. Cale found money to be better than fame, and believed it would be better to be rich than to be a hero.\u201cAh, yes, yes indeed. I saw your silver shield, Young master Cale. You did something marvelous.\u201dThe priest took a gulp and grabbed Cale\u2019s hand to inspect him. The priest\u2019s words made the nobles around Cale look at him with curiosity and doubt.Cale Henituse, the man who was known as trash, had revealed such strength. This fact was a very big shock to everyone. Then there were his actions just a few moment ago, where he protected people against the explosion before falling down while spitting out blood. But now, he was standing there as if nothing was wrong.The nobles were observing Cale, and, because the king had left, many of the citizens were looking toward Cale as well. They could not forget about that silver light.Cale briefly looked around at the faces of the curious nobles. Each time he made eye contact with one of them, they all showed different reactions. Some continued to show their curiosity, others avoided his gaze, and some just smiled at him.Cale looked back at the priest after looking around at all the nobles, and responded to his statement. Cale\u2019s voice was still nonchalant and calm.\u201cI guess this is your first time looking at an ancient power.\u201dAh.The priest let out a gasp.Ancient power, a relic of the past you could only gain from fortuitous encounters. Each of them were said to have unique skills and strength.\u201cI see.\u201dA familiar voice started to speak from behind Cale and put a hand on Cale\u2019s shoulder.Cale knew that he had arrived.\u201cYour highness.\u201dCale turned around and made eye contact with the crown prince, Alberu Crossman. He then realized that this moment was similar to what he had read in the novel.The hero of the plaza terror incident. In order to deal with the complaints from the citizens about their safety and the fact that the royal family and nobles were trying to run away, the crown prince had turned Choi Han into a beacon of hope. The person who created the hero Choi Han in the novel was crown prince Alberu, the man in front of Cale right now.Cale realized that the moment he was expecting was here as soon as he saw the look in prince Alberu\u2019s eyes. He had expected this to happen from the moment he used the ancient power, and had quickly formulated a plan in his mind. Cale was planning to use this situation to his benefit from this moment onward.The crown prince also realized that Cale was very similar to him.\u201c\u2026Mister Cale.\u201dPrince Alberu hugged Cale with half shock and half admiration on his face.\u201cThank you. We are so proud of what you did.\u201dAnybody could see that the crown prince was so full of admiration that he showed a reaction that he should not have shown as a prince.In that moment, Cale heard crown prince Alberu whisper in his ear in a voice that only Cale could hear.\u201cMister Cale, you and I share the same style right?\u201d\u2018Of course.\u2019Alberu\u2019s voice was a bit tense at finding someone like him.\u201cI will make sure there is nothing annoying and reward you handsomely. What do you think?\u201d\u2018In that case.\u2019Cale lifted up his hands and smiled as he hugged prince Alberu back. He then started to speak.\u201cYour highness, it was nothing. I only did what any citizen of the kingdom would do.\u201dThe young dragon\u2019s voice echoed in Cale\u2019s mind.\u2026Something is very odd here.The dragon who saw all of this happen was young, but pretty sharp.Cale finished his fraudulent hug of admiration, before heading to the palace. Although healing and investigation was the purpose of heading to the palace, since it was like this anyways, Cale was thinking about taking at least a pillar of the palace for himself as he walked with the crown prince.Naturally, the crown prince\u2019s face was stiff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The crown prince was asking Cale for a performance until the end. Naturally, the carriage Cale was on was the crown prince\u2019s carriage that was urgently brought over to the plaza.\u201cMister Cale, please get on first. For today, you deserve this honor.\u201dThe crown prince had a smile on his face that was completely different from his stiff expression from earlier. The crown prince knew that other people were now watching, and needed to keep up the act.\u201cHow could I do that? I cannot get on the carriage before you, your highness. You are the star that shines down on citizens like myself.\u201d\u2026Human, is your head okay?Cale just ignored the Black Dragon\u2019s question. The crown prince patted Cale\u2019s shoulder and started to speak.Pat. Pat.The crown prince was patting his shoulder quite hard.\u201cIt is an expression of my respect for you. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cIf that is the case, this lacking citizen will get on first.\u201dCrown prince Alberu was the only one from the royal family who was still at the site of the terror incident. He stayed at the plaza even after the rest of the royal family had gone back in order to command the knights to take care of everything and to show care for Cale. Next to him was Cale Henituse, the man of the hour and the one who will remain etched in the people\u2019s minds about this incident.The sight of the two of them standing together was like a beautiful painting, and it made people think highly of both of them.Cale got onto the crown prince\u2019s carriage and peeked to the side.The nobles were near the carriage, with the citizens being right behind them. Cale lightly gestured with his eyes to say goodbye to Eric, Gilbert, Amiru, and Taylor before smiling to Neo Tolz, who was blankly staring at him.Neo Tolz flinched after seeing Cale\u2019s smile while Venion, who was standing next to Neo, stiffened up. It was not just him. All of the high-ranking nobles were observing Cale.\u2018How could that trash gain such a power? No, how could that trash act in such a way?\u2019They were all sending him gazes that seemed to imply those statements, but Cale ignored them and continued to stare at Neo until Neo flinched and turned away.\u2018I guess I can get rid of one of his evil minions.\u2019That was what Cale was thinking as he got on the carriage. His smile then disappeared as soon as he was inside. Crown prince Alberu entered behind him and then ordered his servant.\u201cTreat the lady over there as a VIP.\u201dAlberu was, of course, talking about Rosalyn. The carriage door started to slowly close and Cale made eye contact with Rosalyn before the door closed completely. Rosalyn\u2019s smile seemed reliable.Click.The carriage door finished closing and Cale leaned back on the chair.\u2018The royal carriage really is a different quality. Where do they get such leather for their seats?\u2019Cale felt the comfort of the seat before turning to look at Alberu, who had also gotten rid of that fake smile from earlier and now had a stoic expression, just like Cale.\u201cDo you need any healing?\u201dCale bluntly responded back.\u201cMy body is healthy, but shouldn\u2019t I get the best doctors and priests to take a look? I want to just lay around for about three or four days.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s laugh sounded like a sigh. However, he then nodded his head.\u201cYou\u2019re right. That will be good. The noble who saved everyone is hurt, and the crown is giving him the best treatment possible to nurse him back to health. Very nice.\u201dThe crown prince did not keep up his act now that he knew he and Cale were of the same type of people. That was why he got right to the point.\u201cMr. Cale, are you involved with them?\u201dThem. Alberu was talking about the people who appeared at the plaza today. Cale made eye contact with Alberu as he thought about how the Black Dragon was probably following him right now in his invisible state.This was what the Black Dragon had said as Cale got into the carriage earlier.Why did the crown prince not do anything when the other humans were dying? He is strong.The crown prince was hiding his strength. He did not do anything, even when one of his servants died and a young knight lost his arms and legs. He just pretended to be weak and hid.\u2018I thought he was a good person, even if he had a tendency to use people.\u2019But that was not the case.That was why Cale comfortably responded. He had a bright smile on his face.\u201cYour highness, why would I do something so annoying?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dThe crown prince immediately agreed. There was no way someone who was hiding as a trash would do such a thing. Furthermore, Alberu could tell that Cale only stepped in because there really were no other alternatives.\u201cThe crown may try to uselessly investigate you.\u201d\u201cYou will protect me, right, your highness?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking such an obvious question?\u201dAlberu was going to protect him. Alberu opened the curtains in order to see the crowd of citizens outside. He put his smile back on and continued to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s finish our conversation when I visit you later to check on how you are doing.\u201dThe crown prince was going to go visit a healing noble and wanted to talk. There was quite a lot to talk about. Cale thought about Rosalyn, the ancient power, and his reward, as he started to speak.\u201cYour highness.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf it is for a conversation with the star of our nation, this Cale is always available.\u201dThe corner of Alberu\u2019s smile started to turn into a frown.\u201cI don\u2019t want my actions to be exaggerated when you package it up for the public.\u201d\u201cI will only package it up a bit. I just need enough for people to not complain about the crown.\u201dThe crown prince continued to speak while casually saying the next part. It sounded a bit glib, but it was the truth.\u201cAnyways, thank you. The number of people injured was lower thanks to your help.\u201dIt was difficult to tell whether crown prince Alberu was a good person or bad person. No, Cale didn\u2019t even know if he was human. However, Cale did not care about any of that, and just said what he needed to say.\u201cI look forward to my reward.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dThe crown prince shook his head, but did not say anything like, \u2018don\u2019t look forward to a reward.\u2019 It meant that he will make sure Cale was rewarded handsomely for his efforts.That was how Cale entered the palace once again while receiving a much different treatment than previously. The fanciest and most luxurious room in the palace, that was reserved for foreign royal visitors, was provided for Cale.\u2018Choi Han\u2019s group stayed here in the novel too.\u2019Cale laid down on the extremely luxurious bed that was worlds softer than his own bed, and started to eat grapes one by one.Another person who was staying in the palace came to visit at this time.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dIt was Rosalyn, and, as expected, she was not alone.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dChoi Han was with her. On, Hong, and Lock were standing behind Choi Han with pale expressions on their faces. However, Cale started to frown after looking at the last person behind all of them.\u201cY, young masteeeeeeeeer!\u201dIt was deputy butler Hans. Hans looked like he wanted to cry. Hans, Choi Han, and Lock were able to enter the palace as Cale\u2019s servant and guards. Cale put his hand up toward Hans, who looked like he was going to rush toward him.\u201cStop.\u201dThat made Hans stop moving, which gave Cale time to get up from the bed and start to speak to the others.\u201cCome on in.\u201dHe was very relaxed, as if he was the owner of this palace.Cale had a conversation with Hans first. Hans checked Cale\u2019s condition before reporting like normal, as if the teary face from moments before had never existed in the first place.\u201cI have contacted master-nim back home. I thought it would be better if we contacted them before the crown did, so I hired a mage to open a communication port. In doing so, I ended up spending a lot of money.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cAnd.\u201dHans peeked toward Rosalyn.\u2018Of course he knows.\u2019The corner of Cale\u2019s lips went up just slightly. Hans was a great butler candidate and knew more about the nobles than Cale did. There was no way such a person would not have other information as well.\u201cContinue.\u201dHans reported after getting Cale\u2019s permission.\u201cI told everyone in the residence to remain quiet about Rosalyn-nim for now.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cYou did well.\u201dRosalyn and Cale praised Hans. Since they have not had any time to discuss, it was better for Rosalyn and Cale that they remained quiet about her for now.\u201cExcuse me, young master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI did give a report, but I think you should contact home via a communication port in the near future. If you don\u2019t, I believe master-nim will personally travel up here.\u201dHis father, Count Deruth, would definitely do that. Cale was busy thinking about how he could take care of this situation without jeopardizing Basen\u2019s position as the successor, so he just nodded his head. Hans got up after seeing Cale nod.He was a sharp one.He knew that he needed to leave for Cale to speak with Rosalyn, Choi Han, and Lock.\u201cThen I will go look for the caretaker of this palace to discuss a few things.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dHans had left the room, so the Black Dragon finally revealed himself. He then headed to Cale\u2019s bed and started to eat the fruits located there as he started his report.\u201cThere are no video or audio recording devices in here.\u201dHe really did a good job with whatever Cale told him to do, even if he did not look like he would do so. That was what Cale was thinking as he looked around this room that he was staying in.It was a room for foreign royalty. Doing something like placing recording devices in such a room would easily be a cause for war. That was why the royalty in all of the different nations worked to hide video and audio recording devices in hidden locations around common areas, like the dining room.This meant that they could say anything they wanted to in this room. However, Rosalyn still cast a noise cancellation spell.\u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe.\u201d\u201cMiss Rosalyn, that side of you is wonderful.\u201dCale agreed with Rosalyn\u2019s decision and then looked toward Choi Han. Choi Han has had his head down since he entered the room. Cale had a pretty good idea about what happened after seeing Choi Han like this.He did not manage to kill Redika.\u201cTell me.\u201dChoi Han lifted his head up.That mage appeared in the location you told me. I tried to kill him, but his subordinates rushed toward me.\u201cI\u2019m sure they were ready to die.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe secret organization valued Redika quite a bit for some reason.\u201cSo they escaped?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dChoi Han lowered his head again as he continued to speak.\u201cI only managed to cut off his left arm.\u201d\u2018Hmm?\u2019\u201cI then burned the arm up in case he came back for his arm to put it back together. Ah, his left eye should be injured as well.\u201d\u2018Isn\u2019t that a death sentence for a mage? Mages needed to cast magic with both hands for their mana to be balanced. Losing an arm would end up affecting that quite a bit. Cale looked toward Choi Han with a stiff expression.Choi Han was standing there with his head down and fists clenched.\u201cI was supposed to kill him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo need to be sorry. You did well.\u201dCale looked toward Lock, On and Hong who were sitting next to Choi Han. On and Hong did not move toward the Black Dragon like usual. They were stiff in Lock\u2019s arms. Lock was looking at Cale with a desperate gaze.\u2018Did he go berserk?\u2019Cale looked toward Choi Han and asked.\u201cHis subordinates?\u201d\u201cI thought it was better to kill them so I took care of them.\u201dThat made the red kitten Hong rub his face on his sister On\u2019s body. Choi Han had used his black aura to completely get rid of them without any traces. This was the first time Hong realized that you could melt a person with aura.\u201cIt\u2019s best to be thorough to prevent any future issues. You didn\u2019t break any buildings or anything like that, right?\u201dCale was worried that Choi Han went berserk and destroyed some other things. Harris Village and the Blue Wolf Tribe incident were both traumas for Choi Han. Cale was worried that he would go crazy when seeing the people who caused those traumas standing right in front of his eyes.\u2018If he goes berserk, I may end up having to clean up the mess.\u2019Since Choi Han was staying with him, Cale would need to clean up the mess. However, Cale did not want to do such a thing.\u201cYes, of course. As Cale-nim mentioned, I made sure not to damage anything around the area.\u201dThe kittens remembered what Choi Han said to the subordinates as he killed them.\u2018All of the important people in my life were killed or almost killed by you. Including today!\u2019The buildings were not damaged, but the look on Choi Han\u2019s face as he melted the secret organization members alive was quite scary. He did not go berserk, however, that made it scarier. On and Hong finally moved toward the Black Dragon to get a sense of relief by the dragon\u2019s side. The strongest, cutest, and nicest individual in this room was this Black Dragon.Cale observed the kittens heading to the bed before speaking to Choi Han.\u201cI see, you worked hard.\u201dCale\u2019s words made Choi Han look up at him. Cale looked at Choi Han and everyone else as he continued to speak.\u201cAll of you did something amazing today. It is thanks to you that all those people lived. Miss Rosalyn, you worked hard as well.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s tightly clenched fists loosened up a bit. Rosalyn looked at Lock, Choi Han, and the kittens that were wagging their tails, before finally landing her gaze on Cale. An odd sense of cohesion surrounded her.The Black Dragon started to speak at that point.\u201cYou worked hard too.\u201dThis made Cale start to smile as he nodded his head.\u201cIndeed. I worked very hard. That is why I will be rewarded.\u201dAnd the time to have their first discussion about his reward soon arrived.\u201cYou can head out now.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dCrown prince Alberu sent out the priest who just sat there filling the time without doing any actual treatment on Cale before turning to make eye contact with Cale. Cale had an expression of awe that the crown prince came to visit, until the door closed and Alberu started to speak.\u201cThat expression of yours is giving me the chills.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dCale returned to his usual relaxed expression. Alberu seemed to find that more bearable as he sat on a chair next to the bed Cale was laying on looking like a patient.\u201cI have said that you are currently resting. I said that you got up at the plaza even though it was difficult so that you could help calm things down like a proper noble.\u201dAlberu started to smile before adding on.\u201cSince you revealed that you possess an ancient power at the plaza, I played along and said you have a defensive ancient power that is not very strong. That is what you wanted, right?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dCale pretended to contemplate as he responded back.\u201cA young noble who is weak but stepped forward for the kingdom. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dCale preferred it this way that people thought he was \u2018not very strong.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a lie, he really was weak.\u201cBy tomorrow, any information about rumors about you and the current situation will be delivered to you through your butler. Make sure to take a look.\u201dPrince Alberu was definitely treating Cale differently than he had treated Choi Han in the novel. He didn\u2019t have even an ounce of a warm smile and just had a stoic expression. It was as if he was dealing with someone he didn\u2019t want to deal with because he needed to do so.That was how Cale wanted it to be.Cale made eye contact with the crown prince who was staring at him. Prince Alberu started to frown after seeing Cale\u2019s relaxed demeanor and started to think for a bit before he finally said what was on his mind.\u201c\u2026By the way.\u201dThis extremely hesitant attitude made it seem like he was expecting something. Cale just waited patiently as this was rare to see from the crown prince.While Cale was waiting, the Black Dragon who had woken up from his nap underneath the bed started to talk to Cale in his mind.Now I am certain. He is not human.The crown prince asked his question at the same time.\u201c\u2026You are human, right?\u201dWhat was going on? A straight and a hook landed on him at the same time. Cale suddenly wished he really was hurt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Alberu subconsciously let out a sigh.\u201cSigh. Right, of course you are human.\u201dCale could see Alberu point at both of them before continuing to speak.\u201cYou and I are both human.\u201dThe Black Dragon spoke into Cale\u2019s mind at that moment.That is a lie. He is not completely human.\u2018Little Dragon, can you please stop?\u2019Cale was having a difficult time maintaining his composure. However, a critical weakness existed between Cale and the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon could talk to Cale whenever he wanted to do so, but Cale was unable to talk back to the dragon. It was a one-way communication.It was his fault for lacking any magic skills.This is my first time seeing a race with such an atmosphere around them in this great Dragon\u2019s four years of life.The dragon\u2019s four years of life. The Black Dragon had only seen himself, humans, and the Cat Tribe and Wolf Tribe members he recently met.The crown prince was not any of those species. Cale started to speak toward the crown prince who was looking at him.\u201cOf course. Is there much to being human? We\u2019re all human if we live amongst each other.\u201dCale made up his mind to forget about what the Black Dragon had said. Prince Alberu quietly looked toward Cale before starting to speak.\u201cYou are right. There really isn\u2019t much to being human. However.\u201dHowever. But. Cale was wondering if he could stop hearing these words. Prince Alberu started to speak to Cale as he was contemplating.\u201cI thought I was mistaken at the banquet hall, but there are some weird smells around you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Smell?\u201dCale responded with shock.\u201cI just showered.\u201dThe crown prince opened and closed his mouth a couple times without saying anything after hearing Cale\u2019s retort. Cale could see the wrinkles on Alberu\u2019s forehead from frowning. He looked like he was contemplating something. However, he erased any traces of it from his face and got to the point of the matter.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for two people who are similar like us to try to sugar coat things. So, what do you want as your reward?\u201dAlberu crossed his arms as he asked Cale. The reason Alberu had come here so late had to do with dealing with the aftermath of the incident, but it was also because he had to look at the files regarding Cale Henituse.However, there was nothing on Cale. Well, there was something, but it was useless.< Famous in the Northeast for being trash. >< Completely pushed out of the successor position two years ago but shows no complaints about the decision. >< No signs of trying to cause issues in the home. >It just said Cale Henituse was trash who liked to fool around and drink. That was worse than having no information. The Cale in front of Alberu was not trash.For example, take the way he responded to the prince\u2019s question.\u201cYour highness, can you please explain what I will need to do for you first?\u201dThere was no way a trash would ask something like this. Alberu answered honestly.\u201cI want you to not say anything to the nobles.\u201dThat was the hardest thing. That was why this was the crown\u2019s request to Cale and why they were willing to wager Cale\u2019s reward with it. Today\u2019s events were embarrassing for the crown and they could not let this affect their position of power.That was why he was asking Cale for this, and he was able to ask Cale this because Cael was part of the Henituse family that was not part of any faction.\u201cI also want you to praise the crown every so often if you are asked.\u201d\u201cIncluding speaking about your very understanding nature, your highness?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dOne corner of both Alberu and Cale\u2019s lips started to go up as they started to smile. Their smiles were pretty similar.\u201cSince it is an ancient power, isn\u2019t what you revealed today the extent of your power?\u201d\u201cOf course. It is useless for anything else.\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders at Alberu\u2019s inspecting gaze even though he was the one to answer. Based on what Cale read in the novel, Crown prince Alberu knew more about ancient powers than most people.\u2018Now that I think about it, the Healing Star was given to him by his mother.\u2019Cale recalled this memory that suddenly popped into his mind. The crown prince had asked what he wanted as a reward. The tone of Alberu\u2019s voice made it sound like he would probably agree to anything, yet Alberu seemed comfortable.\u201cWhat is it that you want? Something for your family? My agreement to invest in the Northeastern Shoreline? Or settling the battle for power in the Northeast?\u201dThat was why Cale responded back comfortably as well.\u201cNone of those belong to me, your highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t belong to you?\u201dCale pointed to himself as Alberu stared at him.\u201cPlease give it to me.\u201dWhat Cale wanted was something he needed for himself.Alberu, who was silent for a moment, let out a snort. He had figured out what this trash wanted from him. Although Cale had lived as trash, humans, no, all living existences, wished to aim for greater heights and take control of everything.In the end, Cale was the most important to himself, more than his family or the people around him.\u201cThen what is it you want? A higher title? A medal? Do you want to have your own faction in the capital?\u201dAlberu\u2019s expression turned odd as he asked. Contrary to Alberu\u2019s expectations, Cale shook his head no at Alberu\u2019s suggestions. It meant that none of them were correct. He then said a single word.\u201cMoney.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dCale accurately laid it out for Alberu. For someone like Cale whose greatest desire was to live a peaceful life, this was what mattered most to him.\u201cPlease give me money. I don\u2019t want a medal or a higher title.\u201dCold hard cash was always the best. What would a title or medal do for him when a war was about to break out? It was much smarter to take cash and use it to buy food, land, or other material things.The final ancient power Cale was aiming to get after the \u2018Sound of the Wind\u2019 was one that became stronger the more money he used.Cale could see Alberu put his hand to his forehead. He then lowered his hand as he asked Cale a question.\u201cTo buy alcohol?\u201dCale responded right back.\u201cHow did you know?\u201dAlberu smiled and accepted Cale\u2019s request. He then got up and informed Cale about the details.\u201cOnce you receive the report tomorrow, take a look and then let me know how much you want.\u201d\u201cWill you come visit me again?\u201d\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it?\u201dCale responded with an extremely fake expression on his face.\u201cIt would be the highest honor to see you again, your highness.\u201dAlberu felt chills on the back of his neck from Cale\u2019s response and told Cale to rest before immediately heading out of the room and disappearing. Cale just quietly observed the door the crown prince closed behind him.But what kind of power allows him to dye his hair other than mana? Human, answer me. I am curious.Cale ignored the Black Dragon\u2019s question and immediately went to bed. He was a patient from this moment on.However, he was not a patient who could rest peacefully. Hans handed Cale a letter from Ron first thing in the morning.\u201cMr. Ron has left as scheduled.\u201dCale nodded his head and opened the letter.< Young master. I will report to you once a month. I didn\u2019t know that you were hiding such a power, young master. Choi Han told me about how that mage looks like. I will remember it. I have also informed Beacrox about it as well. >Sounded like Redika would die if Ron saw him as well. That was what Cale was thinking as he looked toward the people who came to visit him after Hans.\u201c\u2026I heard you were seriously injured.\u201dEric Wheelsman. Cale had never seen Eric looking so worried. However, Cale did not say he was okay. He needed to be loyal and play his part.\u201cI have no strength in my body.\u201d\u201c\u2026Cale.\u201dBut Cale had no strength in his body because he had slept all day.\u201cMy stomach feels weird as well.\u201dThis was because Cale just laid around eating when he wasn\u2019t sleeping. He was so full that there was no room for anything else. Eric looked concerned, Gilbert had a stiff expression on his face, and Amiru looked like she had made up her mind about something. The kittens who had been looking back and forth at the three visitors and Cale started to shake their heads.\u201cLet me know if you need anything.\u201d\u201cYes, please do. We will get you whatever it is.\u201dCale just nodded his head and asked.\u201cSounds like you are not just here to check in on me?\u201dEric, Amiru and Gilbert exchanged glances after hearing Cale\u2019s question. After seeing Amiru and Gilbert nod their heads, Eric took a document out of his pocket and handed it to Cale.\u201cThis is the updated request for the Northeastern shoreline tourism investment. We brought it with us since we were heading to the palace to see you.\u201dCale turned the first page of the document. The first word on the next page was Navy. Gilbert also seemed to have made up his mind.Cale peeked toward Amiru who smiled at him Based on Eric\u2019s actions, it looked like Amiru kept it a secret like Cale had asked.\u201cThe news will soon reach the Henituse territory along with our proposal.\u201d\u201cI see. Then will you be meeting with the crown prince?\u201d\u201cYes. We are scheduled to meet him tonight. We can only start moving if he shows any interest in it.\u201dCale looked toward Amiru and Gilbert and casually started to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sure it will work out.\u201dHis voice was full of confidence. It was because he was sure. Eric and the others felt a sense of relief after hearing Cale\u2019s statement. Cale waved the document in front of the three of them and started to speak.\u201cYou can send such documents like this via a servant in the future. I know it is difficult for you to come visit, so you do not need to come.\u201d\u201cNo, we will continue to come. You need to know about it as well.\u201dCale just casually nodded his head at Eric, Gilbert and Amiru and then sent them out. It was difficult to greet people while leaning on his bed wearing a patient robe. That was why Cale kicked the blanket away and comfortably welcomed the next group.He started to speak to Choi Han who was standing there like a sinner.\u201cGo.\u201dRosalyn bit down on her lips. She had removed her magic and was standing there with her original red eyes and red hair. She also got rid of her robe and was in formal attire.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, young master Cale. But I need Choi Han and Lock.\u201dNow that Rosalyn revealed herself in the palace, she needed to return to the Breck Kingdom as fast as possible. Since it was revealed that she was still alive, the people who attempted to kill her may start to hide the evidence.But she could not go back on her own. This incident revealed that she was a very skilled mage, which meant that the enemy will make sure to have stronger forces when attacking her. That was why she needed strong allies.Lock was standing by the door just fidgeting without approaching Cale. Cale looked at Choi Han and Lock before speaking as if it was only natural.\u201cWhat are you sorry about? Miss Rosalyn, you helped us out with a very difficult situation. Then we should help you out as well.\u201dRosalyn could see that Cale was smiling.\u201cMiss Rosalyn is Lock\u2019s noona and Choi Han\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for putting it that way.\u201dRosalyn may have been close to death because of the assassination attempt, but she was certain that this was going to be her turning point.Cale took a step forward and looked at Choi Han.\u201cCale-nim, I have to protect you.\u201d\u201cChoi Han.\u201dChoi Han needed to go in order for Cale to rest in peace and prepare to hide during the war. Choi Han could see Cale\u2019s uniquely relaxed smile.\u201cI will not die.\u201d\u2018I plan on making a ton of money and getting just strong enough to run away as needed to live peacefully. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to live as long as possible.\u2019Cale was also thinking that with the Black Dragon by his side, there was no reason for Choi Han to protect him. In fact, in front of the Black Dragon, Choi Han himself was just baggage.\u201cI see. I worried for no reason.\u201dCale turned away from Choi Han who looked a bit better and looked toward Lock. He then flicked his finger to call Lock over to him. Lock flinched at Cale\u2019s motion before slowly approaching. Why was this coward so scared?However, Cale had no plan to give any thought to such reaction.\u201cLock, I will take care of your younger siblings. Go and come back to the Henituse territory in 3 months.\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d\u201cWhat is the excuse me for? Did you forget about our deal?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCale thought about how he was going to use Lock as Lock blankly stared at him. He then handed Lock a map. It was a map of the Northeast territory that he got from Hans.\u201cHenituse. Come to the one that\u2019s marked like that. I will be there with your younger siblings, so you must come back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Somewhere to return to-\u201dCale didn\u2019t care for the mumbling Lock and clenched Lock\u2019s shoulder as he started to speak. Lock needed to come back for Cale\u2019s life to be easier.\u201cYes, somewhere to return to. Remember. You must return within 3 months.\u201d\u201cYes- yes sir! I will definitely come back within 3 months.\u201dAfter taking care of Lock\u2019s issue to the point that Lock vigorously nodded his head, Cale felt a sense of relief. The story from the novel was twisted quite a bit already, but at least the major point was flowing as it was supposed to.This was good because he would know more about the future the more the story followed the novel. Cale was disappointed that he could not send Beacrox with the mas well, but he could always send Beacrox with Ron after Ron came back from his time off.Cale laid down on the bed with a more relaxed heart than ever before as he proceeded to look at the people around his room. He then turned to look at Hans who had opened the door and entered.Hans looked at Choi Han who was protecting the door like a knight, then at Lock who was playing with the kittens, then at Rosalyn who was leisurely reading a book about magic, and finally Cale who was relaxing on the bed. He then quietly approached Cale and whispered.\u201cThere is a rumor going around that his majesty wants to bestow a medal to you, young master.\u201dEverybody in the room stopped moving after hearing what Hans had to say.Hans then quietly handed Cale a document. It was a document that contained the rumors going on about the Plaza Terror Incident. Cale had just one reaction after reading the first line.< Cale Henituse, the noble who showed the pride of the Henituse family that protects the Kingdom from the Forest of Darkness >\u201cHaaaaaa.\u201dIt was a deep sigh.He had expected it, but it was still so very annoying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: Somehow (6)A week later, Cale got off the carriage. The carriage that he got off from had the Henituse Golden Turtle on it.- It has been a while.Cale agreed with what the Black Dragon said inside his head.Cale was currently at the Plaza of Glory. A large fence was around the northern part of the plaza that was destroyed from the explosion.Cale just walked forward, only looking toward his seat. The Henituse family\u2019s knight brigade, led by their Vice Captain, walked with Cale in the center of their formation in order to protect him.As Cale was walking, he heard someone say something that gave him the chills.\u201cOh, young master Silver Light!\u201dCale immediately started to frown.\u201cAhem, hem.\u201dCale could see the smirk on the Vice Captain\u2019s face as he let out some fake coughs and started to frown some more. The Vice Captain lowered his body a bit to whisper in Cale\u2019s ear.\u201cYoung master, I guess they call you, \u2018young master Silver Light,\u2019 now. Ahem, cool people like you are bound to get awesome nicknames.\u201d\u2018Shit.\u2019Cale held back the rough words in his mind.Young master Silver Light, young master Shield, he didn\u2019t want to hear such cheesy and embarrassing things. However, Cale knew that it would have been much worse if it wasn\u2019t for the crown prince subduing the rumors, and so he could not say anything about it.All he could do was stoically speak to the Vice Captain, who was shrugging his shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll stop if I drink and act like I usually do, right?\u201d\u201cAhem, hem!\u201dThe Vice Captain could not say anything and just turned away. That made Cale start to smile, but that smile immediately disappeared. It was because of what the Vice Captain said next.\u201cI think it would be best if you avoided alcohol, since you are still recovering.\u201dCale was still officially recovering and not 100 percent.The official story was that he was injured because he used his ancient power past its intended limits so that he could protect the crowd, causing a miracle to happen that prevented the explosion.That miraculous story naturally originated from the crown prince. That was why the staff at the Henituse residence was busy protecting the injured Cale.It was not just the staff at the capital. Cale thought about his father, Count Deruth, who was planning on coming up to the capital a few days ago. This was what Deruth had said through the video communication.- Cale, did you see the faces of those bastards? Your dad will kill them all for you. How dare they do such a thing to a person who cannot even swing a sword!Even though Deruth knew Cale had earned an ancient power, the fact that even Cale\u2019s younger sister was better than Cale at swinging a sword made Deruth consider Cale to be weak.- The reason the Henituse family does not take action is not because we are weak. Remember this Cale. We have not taken any actions until now because we are strong. Nobody\u00a0shall take any actions against you like this in the future.That was what Countess Violan had said while calming Count Deruth down. But that must have been the truth, as no nobles sent any messages or came to look for Cale once Cale left the palace and returned to his own residence. Even Eric and company did not show up.\u2018That made it easy.\u2019Cale had used that free time very efficiently. Cale, who had been looking forward as he walked, could see the knight and soldier guarding the entrance.\u201cAh, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cDo you need to verify my identity?\u201dThe knight shook his head at Cale\u2019s question and respectfully opened the entrance. Cale had to enter alone from here on. The people who were allowed to enter this time was significantly less than during the birthday celebration, but Cale was the exception.\u201cYoung master Cale-nim, please enter.\u201d\u201cGreat, thanks. Keep up the good work.\u201d\u201c...Yes sir!\u201dCale thought that the knight was probably overworked, so he patted the knight on the shoulder as the knight bowed and vigorously responded to him. He then walked in, not knowing that the knight was watching him walk in for a very long time.Cale continued to walk at a leisure pace.The Plaza of Glory.The king planned to respect the fallen and give medals to certain people for their actions during the plaza terror incident today. The recipients were given the qualifications to stand at the second highest platform, right underneath the king, in the plaza today.Cale was wearing a more luxurious black outfit than usual as he arrived at his spot.\u201cCale.\u201d\u201cHyung-nim, you got here early.\u201dCale smiled at Eric Wheelsman, who had called out to him, before standing at his spot. This was the spot for the nobles. Cale was standing here. But why?Eric Wheelsman, Amiru, Gilbert, and all of the other nobles could only watch Cale in silence. It was because they had all heard some news regarding Cale.Cale Henituse has declined to accept the medal of honor and has yielded the medal to someone else.In addition, he dragged his still injured body to participate in the ceremony.Amiru Ubarr looked toward Cale, who was looking up at the sky.\u201cIt is a beautiful day today. Probably because we are here to respect the fallen.\u201dCale\u2019s red hair fluttered in the wind and created a stark comparison to his black outfit. Amiru had a curious smile after seeing Cale as his usual confident self.\u201cIt is probably because of you, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dCale looked toward Amiru with confusion. Amiru responded back with a calm and warm smile. Cale found that reaction to be odd, but still said what he needed to say.\u201cYou are leaving today, young lady Amiru?\u201d\u201cYes. I believe you are heading out tomorrow? I will see you at our Ubarr territory.\u201dCale was going to visit the Ubarr territory after this ceremony.\u201cYes. I want to see the ocean.\u201d\u201cI heard. It is for your recovery?\u201d\u201cYes. It will be nice to get some fresh air.\u201d\u2018Recovery my ass. I am completely healthy and will be going there to get even stronger.\u2019However, Cale agreed with Amiru and nodded his head before adding on.\u201cOf course, that is not the only reason.\u201d\u201cAh, of course.\u201dAmiru, as well as Gilbert and Eric who were listening, all started to smile. It was a similar smile to Cale\u2019s. After today, the nobles will all hear about what is going on.The development and investment for a military base at the Northeastern coastline. That was why Amiru and Gilbert were hurrying out of the capital tonight. It was to prevent any false information from leaking out, as well as because the crown wanted things to progress as quickly as possible.Of course, this was only possible because the Henituse family agreed to loan a significant amount of money to Amiru and Gilbert\u2019s territories. That was the other reason why Cale needed to visit Amiru and Gilbert\u2019s territories.\u2018Cale, we are planning to send someone as well, but if you are going to go there anyways, take a look while you are there.\u2019\u2018Father, wouldn\u2019t it better for an expert to go?\u2019\u2018Having more pairs of eyes is always better.\u2019Cale agreed to do as Count Deruth asked.\u201cWe are in your care.\u201d\u201cWe are in your care, young master Cale.\u201dCale waved at Amiru and Gilbert to say not to worry about it, as he looked back to the front. King Zed had arrived.The memorial and medal ceremony then started.King Zed spoke in a loud voice that was stronger than ever. There still was a large number of people in the plaza, but the atmosphere was completely different. It was very quiet.\u201cWe are gathered back here today to show that we will not cower under fear.\u201dKing Zed called out to the crowd once again. It was a warning to the enemies, as well as something to rally the crowd. King Zed looked down to the plaza from the highest platform as he continued to speak.\u201cMany people showed heroic deeds during that incident. We were able to protect this land like the past thanks to their bravery.\u201dIt looked like King Zed had made eye contact with Cale at that time, but Cale hoped that it was not the case. Cale stealthily turned away in order to look past the King toward the sky behind him. He then thought about what the Black Dragon had said.\u2018Blessing of the Sun God? I do not feel the power of any god from those weak humans. The only special one is the crown prince.\u2019There was no truth to the belief that the Crossman family was blessed by the Sun God. Cale, who had learned another useless truth, decided to pretend that he did not know anything, as usual. The Black Dragon seemed to get excited at the fact that Cale told him to keep that a secret between the two of them, and happily agreed.\u201cIn that regard, we will now hand out the medals to those heroic individuals!\u201dKing Zed started the medal ceremony and everyone went up one by one to receive their medal.Waaaaaaaaaaa-Cheering filled the plaza, as if it had never been silent from the start. The Black Dragon\u2019s voice filled Cale\u2019s head once again.- Humans are interesting.Whaaaaaaa-Cale could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice, as well as the cheering of the crowd for a knight who had just received a medal. Cale felt like he could guess what the Black Dragon found to be interesting.However, because Cale was human, he understood the feelings of the people who were still alive better than the Black Dragon. There were times to be sad and times to be excited.Clap, clap, clap.That was why he clapped for the medal recipients as well. The atmosphere was much better now. People all enjoyed the medal ceremony as if it was a festival. This jovial environment made it possible for anybody to approach Cale right now.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dCale turned toward the quiet voice calling out to him. There were quite a lot of nobles who headed back home, thinking that the capital was a dangerous place because of the terror incident. That was why the number of nobles here was less than before, but one of those nobles approached Cale and called out to him.\u201cWhat is it, young master Venion?\u201dVenion Stan was still here. In addition, the heads of each region were still here as well.\u201cI heard that you declined a medal. Will you not regret it?\u201dThe gazes of the nobles who had been looking up at the platform all turned toward Venion and Cale. Cale did not know why Venion was smiling so gently and asking him that question.- I want to kill him.Cale was just worried that Venion\u2019s body would blow up right here. Cale hoped that the Black Dragon would calm down as he thought about the medal.Cale had rejected a medal. The reason for it was simple. He did not want to get, \u2018recorded.\u2019There is a record of all of the past kings of the kingdom in the highest floor of the royal library. The floor underneath that holds the record of all of the, \u2018heroes,\u2019 who have received different medals of honor throughout the history of the kingdom.The crown used the fact that they needed to continue to provide these heroes with their reward money to locate and keep track of these heroes.\u2018That might sound like fame and honor to others, but it just sounds like chains to me.\u2019Cale did not want to be recorded anywhere. It was easier to forget someone who was not recorded. Who would remember the incidents at this plaza in the future when war was going to break out soon? Even if they recalled this incident, they would remember other things first.The fact that he knew this was part of the reason Cale had decided to step forward during the terror incident, as well as the reason he wanted to avoid getting recorded.Cale started to smile as he looked toward Venion and started to speak.\u201cWhat would I regret?\u201dCale had nothing to regret. He had received a handsome reward, and most importantly.\u201cIt is enough that we managed to survive.\u201dHe was able to live without getting seriously injured. That was the absolutely most important truth for Cale, no, for Kim Rok Soo. The area around Cale became silent. Venion spoke after a while so as to break that silence.\u201c... I see.\u201d\u201cYes. I am also very shy. I\u2019m too shy to go up there to receive a medal.\u201dVenion\u2019s expression turned odd. However, Cale just shrugged his shoulder and turned around to clap for another person who was receiving a medal.The Black Dragon was debating how to kill Venion quickly and simply, before he looking at Cale and the people around Cale and shook his head.There were too many people looking at Cale right now. Both the nobles and the people down below were looking at Cale. The Black Dragon thought things would get very complicated and annoying for Cale if he killed Venion right now, so he decided to act like Cale and be still, very still, as he watched the ceremony.\u201cThis concludes today\u2019s ceremony. However, this king will not forget this moment. I will remember it day after day in order to not forget the valiant heroes!\u201dThe ceremony ended with the king\u2019s final remarks.Swiiiiiish-A rough wind that sounded like rain brushed through the plaza. Cale brushed back his messed up hair.The crown prince had said that Cale did not need to come to the memorial today. However, Cale still showed up.It was because he knew the weight of someone\u2019s death.He finished his own memorial of sort and put his right hand to his heart. This alerted Eric, who started to speak.\u201cCale! Did you over do it? Does your heart hurt?\u201dCale looked toward Eric in disbelief and Cale\u2019s confident gaze made Eric awkwardly smile as he slowly backed away. Eric seemed to be very embarrassed.Cale smiled at Eric\u2019s reaction and patted his chest two times. He could feel the golden plaque in his inner pocket as he did that. It was the reward he had received from the crown prince.\u2018The crown prince is more generous than I expected.\u2019The golden plaque gave Cale two opportunities to purchase anything, regardless of the cost.It didn\u2019t matter whether he bought two slices of bread or two mountains. All that mattered was that he could only use it twice. Cale was going to use these two opportunities very effectively in the future.\u2018I\u2019m sure that the crown prince was thinking, \u2018how much can you really spend,\u2019 as he gave this to me.\u2019Either that, or he gave it to Cale to see just what Cale could manage to buy with it.\u2018Too bad he was wrong.\u2019Cale started to smile. There were a lot of unique things you could buy in the world, as long as you knew how to buy them.- What are you planning now, weak human? Just be careful.Cale ignored the concerned comment of the Black Dragon, who had seen the smirk on Cale\u2019s face. Cale looked around where he was standing and made eye contact with a lot of people.However, he trusted that these gazes would disappear once he left the capital.That was why Cale, who had finished preparing to leave early the next morning after returning to his residence, handed the Black Dragon a piece of steak along with three other items. The Black Dragon clutched the plate with the steak on it, as he asked.\u201cWhat is this for?\u201dThe three items were all the magic bombs with the detonation devices removed. The compressed mana still existed in these bombs. For now, Cale was planning on using just one of these three bombs. A mischievous smirk appeared on Cale\u2019s face.\u201cDestroy a whirlpool.\u201dCale was planning on overturning Roan Kingdom\u2019s Northeastern sea without anybody knowing about it. It was possible because neither the mermaids nor the Whale Tribe should be at the Northeastern sea right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was planning on taking care of it using the Indestructible Shield and the Vitality of the Heart.\u2018But that was when I didn\u2019t have the Black Dragon.\u2019There was no reason for him to work hard when he had the Black Dragon.Cale stuffed the Black Dragon, On, and Hong with a ton of food before sending out these Beasts that averaged 7 years of age and greeting his first guest.\u201cI do not know what you stole, but you did something big.\u201dIt was Billos.\u201cI guess I am a bit famous these days.\u201dBillos shook his head at Cale, who did not seem to be injured at all. He could see Cale starting to drink while claiming to still be injured.\u201cYou indeed are famous, young master Cale. But is it okay for you to drink?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to lie in front of you.\u201dBillos smiled as he filled Cale\u2019s empty cup. He then handed a magic box over to Cale.\u201cHere are your requested items. Thank you for returning the items from last time.\u201dCale had returned the other items to Billos through Choi Han. Cale caressed this new box of items as he looked toward Billos.Cale had already decided how to use the first of the two opportunities to use the golden plaque.He decided to buy some time.Cale decided to buy some time for the moment when the Northern Knights, a dangerous existence for not just Roan Kingdom but also the Breck Kingdom and the other mid-northern kingdoms, started to head south.To be more specific, other than the Northern Knights, there were also the Empire at the center of the Western Continent, the mage slayer, and the Queen of the Southern Jungle. Cale decided to buy some time to get away from all of them. It would be one thing if he was on his own, but now there were others he needed to care for.\u201cBillos.\u201d\u201cDo you deal properties too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, but I do know about what is going on lately.\u201dBillos really was a merchant. He received information very quickly.\u201cThe Western continent is on the verge of blowing up, and that is a great time for merchants like myself to make money.\u201d\u201cMerchants will run toward anything that will give them a profit.\u201dBillos liked Cale, who understood merchants a lot. He also liked that Cale didn't beat around the bush and got right to the point.\u201cThe Whipper Kingdom will become a mess soon. I\u2019m sure you are already expecting it?\u201dBillos nodded his head. The non-mages and mages could no longer coexist in the Whipper Kingdom.\u201cThat is why I am trying to figure out what I can use to make money in that chaos. Young master Cale, what do you think will be the most profitable investment there?\u201dCale easily answered Billos\u2019s question.\u201cPeople.\u201dThe mages will lose the civil war and the Magic Tower will be destroyed. Then what would happen to the remaining mages? All of the mages were not going to die at the end of the civil war.The Whipper Kingdom was the Western continent\u2019s greatest supply of magic devices. There were many mages who stayed far away from power and politics, but there will be nowhere for those types of mages in the Whipper Kingdom after the civil war.In the novel, Crown prince Alberu Crossman was going to target this issue. As for the destroyed Magic Tower, Rosalyn was the highest-tier mage who decides to create a new Magic Tower in a different location.Billos was a very sharp person.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking that the mages will look for a new home.\u201dCale did not give Billos a direct answer.The mages needed to lose in the Whipper Kingdom. That was the only way for the Whipper Kingdom to move to a better future.However, Cale did not put muchweight onto those things.What he wanted was something else.The Western Continent\u2019s greatest supplier of the highest-grade magic devices. Cale needed the things that will remain after the civil war.\u201cImmediately let me know once the Magic Tower is destroyed.\u201d\u201c...May I ask why?\u201dCale shrugged his shoulders and lightly responded.\u201cYou\u2019ll find out when it happens.\u201dThe Magic Tower.Cale was planning on purchasing it.The Magic Tower will be filled with irreparable broken magic devices after the civil war. Cale also knew the method to purchase this Magic Tower. Alberu also will not be able to do anything about Cale\u2019s actions.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dClae nodded his head in agreement. He was looking forward to it as well.Buying the Magic Tower will buy him some time. It will give him time to protect himself from danger. It will be very expensive, but \u2026\u2018Not like it is my money.\u2019Billos saw the evil smirk on Cale\u2019s face and his expectations went up.\u201cThen I will contact you when it happens.\u201d\u201cOkay. I look forward to it.\u201dCale said goodbye to Billos, his first guest. He then greeted his second and last guest. Well, the second guest more so rushed into the room.Cale looked toward the terrace window that was open, before flinching at the existence that rushed in through the window.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dA clay doll the size of his palm climbed in through the window. On and Hong jumped into Cale\u2019s arms in fear.It was because the expression on the clay doll was terrifying. It looked more like a zombie than a doll. The Black Dragon spoke into Cale\u2019s head with magic as usual at that time.- I feel the power of a God.\u201cAh.\u201dCale blurted out someone\u2019s name.The crazy priestess.\u201cCage.\u201dOnce he did that, the clay doll that did not have any eyes or ears but only a mouth started to speak.\u201cI knew you would recognize me, young master Cale. This doll is connected to me. It is a single-use item that can only listen and talk.\u201dShe really was skilled enough to be called a necromancer.Cale looked toward the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon was talking into Cale\u2019s mind, but did not turn invisible. It seemed to have figured out right away that it could listen and speak, but could not see.\u2018Just how strong is this dragon?\u2019Cale suddenly questioned the Black Dragon\u2019s strength.However, the clay doll started to speak and prevented him from thinking about it for a long time.\u201cWe are leaving the capital today. I\u2019m sure Young master Cale does not like us contacting you like this.\u201d\u2018Correct. Absolutely correct.\u2019\u201cHowever, Taylor said he had something he wanted to tell you.\u201d\u201c\u2018Young master Cale when I go take back my position, no, when I am one level higher than my original position, I will return to pay you back for your help.\u2019 is what he wanted me to tell you.\u201d\u201cThere was no need to tell me.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dCale looked into the empty eye sockets of the ugly clay doll.\u201cEven still, Taylor and I both need somewhere to share the news when we get what we desire.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dThe clay doll started to smile at Cale\u2019s words before it started to melt. On and Hong dug even further into Cale\u2019s clothes in order to hide after seeing the doll melt away.\u201cThen please be healthy, young master Cale.\u201dThe clay doll disappeared without leaving any traces behind. The Black Dragon stared at the empty spot where the clay doll stood for a bit before looking toward Cale.\u201cThen is that when I can get my revenge?\u201d [1]Once Taylor Stan returned to power and became the master of Marquis Stan\u2019s estate, the current Marquis and Venion will both need to face the wrath of this Black Dragon.\u201cYes. You can do as you want at that time.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dThe Black Dragon made up his mind about when to get his revenge after hearing about Marquis Stan\u2019s estate\u2019s current situation from Cale.The Black Dragon was going to strike Venion and the Marquis when they were at their lowest point. He was going to show them despair and make them suffer.The Black Dragon flapped its wings happily. It really was a vicious creature.Cale heard the Black Dragon mutter its revenge plan in his head and treated it as a creepy lullaby as he went to bed. Naturally, those vicious comments did not make it easy to sleep. The next morning, Cale was standing in front of the carriage early in the morning.Rosalyn, Choi Han, and Lock saw them off. Cale looked at the three of them with a stoic expression.\u201cCale-nim, if you think you see that mage bastard, please tell the dragon to kill him right away. All you have to tell him is to blow his head up so that he is not useless like me, who was only able to cut off an arm.\u201dChoi Han was spewing vicious things from early in the morning.\u201cI will definitely get stronger and come back! So make sure you listen to the young master while I am gone. Think seriously about the thing I told all of you last time. It is for your future. We all need to get stronger now.\u201dLock was surrounded by his 10 younger siblings and telling them what was on his mind. Rosalyn was whispering with the Black Dragon inside of the carriage, and it was so quiet that even Cale could not hear.\u201cDragon-nim, this is the textbook on Roan Kingdom\u2019s alphabet, and this is the one for the continent\u2019s common language.\u201d\u201cThank you, human. I am great and mighty, so I will learn it quickly.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. Dragon-nim is great and mighty. I pray that you come up with a cool name for yourself.\u201d\u201cI will ask for him to come up with a name for me.\u201d\u201c...I\u2019m sure Cale-nim will know what you mean by asking him.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dCale didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but he stared at Rosalyn, who was watching the Black Dragon with a satisfied smile on her face, and started to frown. He then turned toward Choi Han and started to speak. Choi Han was still going on about what Cale should do in order to stay alive without him.\u201cCale-nim, your rate of survival goes up if you blast anything away in one hit and then run away. Also-.\u201d\u201cEnough with the nonsense.\u201dCale stoically continued speaking to Choi Han, who immediately shut up.\u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201c...Yes. I will make sure to do that.\u201dCale didn\u2019t want to see Choi Han\u2019s innocent smile anymore, so he got onto the carriage. Rosalyn got off as soon as Cale got on.Cale felt the weight of the invisible Black Dragon, as well as On and Hong, on his lap as he looked out the window toward Hans.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe staff, who were all outside the residence to see them off, bade Cale goodbye. Cale did not understand why these staff members would delay their work and come out to see him off. He told them it was fine, but they all still wanted to come and see him off.\u201cYoung master-nim, please return home safely!\u201d\u201cIt was our joy to serve you, young master-nim!\u201d\u201cWe look forward to seeing you again in the future!\u201d\u2018What terrible nonsense.\u2019Cale had no plans to ever come back to the capital. He just casually waved at them and then closed the carriage curtains.That action was the signal to go. Cale\u2019s group had two more carriages than when they arrived, as they left the capital and headed to the Northeast.Ubarr. Cale was headed to the sea that was filled with whirlpools for hundreds of years.***\u201cSniff! It smells salty! Is this the sea?\u201dThe red kitten Hong looked out the open carriage window and sniffed the air. Cale nodded his head as he received a small round item that the Black Dragon handed to him.\u201cThis is the condensed mana from the bomb?\u201dThe Black Dragon nodded his head at Cale\u2019s question and responded.\u201cYes. We can make a new magic bomb now.\u201dCale became jovial at this confirmation and opened the carriage window wide. The cool sea breeze entered the carriage as he looked out toward the Northeastern sea. There were many islands visible in the ocean. The Northeastern sea had quite a number of these small islands.The silver kitten On was also quite excited.\u201cOh! Look at that sharp cliff!\u201dThe sharp cliff brought forth both awe and fear as they were riding across a path created on top of that cliff.Cale looked toward the, \u2018Cliff of Winds,\u2019 the most beautiful sight in the Ubarr territory. There were many small islands next to that cliff.Between the cliff and the islands were multiple raging whirlpools. Those whirlpools were the culprit behind why the seas of the Ubarr territory were so dangerous.\u2018The mage slayer ends up landing on one of those islands after being shipwrecked by the whirlpools, and ends up finding the, \u2018Sound of the Wind.\u2019The mage slayer was known for being an intelligent barbarian. He was even stronger than Lock, the Blue Wolf Tribe member and the future Wolf King, and held the title of the strongest individual in the Western Continent. The mage slayer\u2019s name was Toonka, known as Toonka the Tyrant.\u2018I just need to get it before he does.\u2019If things went as it did in the novel, it was still too early for Toonka to come here. Cale was thinking that there was no chance he would run into Toonka as he looked out to the sea with satisfaction. This journey would be smooth, as long as he avoided Toonka.Cale, who had been looking out the window with satisfaction, could see something far in the horizon.\u201cHmm?\u201dCale rubbed his eyes a bit, but it was still the same.\u201c...Isn\u2019t that a whale?\u201dA pod of large whales were shooting water into the air as they crossed through the Northeastern Sea to head north. Cale suddenly had an ominous feeling, and clenched the magic bomb ingredients in his hand.The whales tended to live in the Northern sea. This was true for the Whale Tribe as well. It was only during the war with the mermaids that the Whale Tribe came down south.\u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s just a group of whales passing by. Tons of whales head north. Absolutely no way, right?\u2019The Black Dragon\u2019s voice echoed inside Cale\u2019s ear.\u201cI feel a strong presence.\u201dThat echo stabbed right into Cale\u2019s brain.That was why Cale was frowning when they arrived at a small village just outside the Cliff of Winds.\u201cYoung master, did you get sick on the way?\u201dCale shook his head at Hans\u2019s question.\u201cNo, I just have a bad feeling.\u201d\u201cAh, it is scary because of the cliffs. However, our driver is a veteran, so you have nothing to worry about.\u201dCale ignored the useless comments from Hans and reached his hand out to the person approaching him.\u201cLong time no see, young lady Amiru.\u201d\u201cHello, young master Cale.\u201dAmiru had her uniquely calm smile on her face as she welcomed Cale and crew.This was a small seaside village in the Ubarr territory. This small village, that had nothing special and allowed the residents to live in peace and quiet until now, was suddenly busy with visitors.The village was quickly changing every day. However, they would soon face an opportunity that will allow their village to change incomparably in the near future. Tomorrow night would be that moment. Tomorrow night, Cale was planning on blowing up a magic bomb deep inside the ocean.However, something that, in Cale\u2019s point of view, should have never happened had happened. This terrible situation began when one of Amiru\u2019s knights came to report to Amiru. The knight urgently approached Amiru and quietly reported.\u201cMy lady, the person we rescued has regained consciousness.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u2018Rescue?\u2019That word made Cale think of a single person.As Cale started to frown with doubt on his mind, Amiru noticed Cale\u2019s expression and started to explain.\u201cWe were inspecting the shoreline and nearby islands for the new naval base when we rescued a shipwrecked person. It seems that he has regained consciousness.\u201d\u2018I have a bad feeling about this.\u2019\u201cWe were debating what to do when we saw him unconscious and being dragged into the whirlpool, but I remembered what you did at the plaza and decided we needed to save him.\u201dAmiru continued to speak to Cale.\u201cBecause a person\u2019s life is precious, right, young master Cale?\u201dCale answered that question after a long moment of silence.\u201c...Of course.\u201d\u201cI knew young master Cale would answer like that.\u201dCale could not even think about Amiru\u2019s smiling face right now. All that was on his mind right now were the details regarding how the novel described Toonka\u2019s situation.1. Quotation for the Black Dragon when he is talking out loud, bullet/hyphen for when he is talking into Cale\u2019s mind.

She then continued to speak.\u201cBased on his outfit and physique, he seemed to be someone from the Whipper Kingdom.\u201dIt was definitely Toonka.Cale\u2019s face turned paler as Amiru continued to speak.The non-mage faction that was fighting against the mages in the Whipper Kingdom were ignored as barbarians by the mages.However, there were no barbarians in this world.All humans had the same brain. It was just that, as time went on and history was created, they all grew and developed in the way that was most suitable for them.The non-mages of the Whipper Kingdom were all strong individuals who managed to take control of the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s harsh mountains and shores without using any magic. They were people who focused on strengthening the human body rather than relying on other factors, such as magic.They were rebelling because they wanted to destroy the current Whipper Kingdom that was made only for mages to have easy lives and return it to its original form.The citizens of the Whipper Kingdom were on the side of these non-mages. Foreigners may think that the barbarians were trying to take over the kingdom, but they were not barbarians to the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s citizens. They were just free people.They used instinct to take down this kingdom of logic.\u2018The problem is that Toonka is extremely stupid.\u2019An intelligent barbarian? There were some who said that, but, in Cale\u2019s opinion, Toonka was just a simple and stupid person who just happened to be very strong.And stupid people were the scariest type of people.This was because you could not talk to them.\u201cYoung master Cale, you do not have to worry about that person. He seemed to recover very quickly.\u201dCale laughed it off after hearing Amiru\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m not worried at all. In fact, I\u2019d prefer it if he continued to get treatment for a long time.\u201dCale\u2019s hope was that Toonka would remain in recovery until he left. Amiru, as well as the knights who were with her in the capital, all looked toward Cale with warm gazes.Cale did not have time to pay attention to such gazes. He had enough of a headache trying to figure out why Toonka arrived here so early.\u201cYoung lady Amiru, could you please show us to our rooms?\u201d\u201cOf course. You are still not at full strength yet, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I am still hurt.\u201d\u201c...Oh no, let\u2019s hurry then.\u201dCale only had a single thought in his head as Amiru started to walk quickly with a serious expression on her face before slowing back down to Cale\u2019s speed.\u2018Billos may be a Flynn and is extremely talented, but how was he so sure about the Civil War? How did he find out so early?\u2019It was because Cale had read the novel that he knew about Billos\u2019s abilities. However, Billos was still ostracized as a bastard son right now. There had to be a limit to his information gathering.That meant that the fact that Billos knew about it meant that the story was changing.\u2018The Civil War must be happening earlier than in the novel.\u2019If Cale thought about it that way, everything made sense. But what would have brought forth the Civil War? However, Cale did not think long about this question.The fact that Toonka was shipwrecked meant that his ship was destroyed by the mages\u2019 attacks and that he had returned from the north after gaining strength.That meant that, even if it was moved up, the story itself did not change.The strength that instilled fear in the mages. The peak of human potential when it came to physical strength. Toonka survived through the sea, mountain, desert, jungle, volcano, and glaciers with just his physical strength alone. [1]Toonka had survived through nature and its harshest elements. There was no way that mages, who use mana, a power that is drawn from nature, could defeat such a person.\u2018Maybe a dragon can kill him.\u2019A dragon could probably still kill Toonka with a single hit.Cale said that he needed to rest as soon as he arrived at the residence and sent everybody out of his room before looking up at the ceiling and starting to speak.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, human.\u201dThe Black Dragon revealed itself. Cale started to seriously speak to the dragon.\u201cStay by my side without going anywhere for awhile.\u201dCale had realized something through the situation with Choi Han and the Black Dragon. If he tried to avoid Toonka, he could instead end up with even more baggage. He needed to prepare for that moment.\u201cI will do whatever I want.\u201dThe Black Dragon snorted and turned away from Cale. However, the way the dragon\u2019s wings were flapping let Cale know that the Black Dragon would listen to him. He was saying one thing, but his body was saying another.Cale felt much better after telling that to the Black Dragon. Cale then looked around his room. It was a residence that the head of the Ubarr family had built a while ago in this small village.\u2018It doesn\u2019t really fit with the rest of the village.\u2019This luxurious room did not fit with the village they were in. That meant that Amiru\u2019s mother, the head of the Ubarr territory, already had plans to develop this area when she originally started the construction of this residence.That vision was finally becoming a reality 10 years later.\u2018It probably took a while to draw in Gilbert\u2019s family and get the protection of the Wheelsman family.\u2019Cale was scheduled to meet with Amiru\u2019s mother before leaving the Ubarr territory. She was going to come from the city with the Ubarr family\u2019s main estate around that time.Cale thought about that meeting for a bit before moving to stand in front of the window. He could see the entire village through the large window, as well as the Cliff of Winds.The Cliff of Winds.For hundreds of years, the water in front of the cliff was ravaged by a whirlpool, causing headaches for the Ubarr citizens trying to head out into the sea.But there was a reason Amiru\u2019s family still considered this area to be important.There were two other villages that were by the sea, but this village was at the center of the three. The shoreline that was in the shape of a crescent moon had this village in the center with two cliffs on either side, making this the only village that made it easy for boats to set out.Furthermore, islands of different sizes were visible from the village, making it a pretty sight as well. It would be a great location for a military base.Cale was scheduled to go to the smallest island tomorrow morning. The, \u2018Sound of the Wind,\u2019 that was the source of all of these whirlpools was located right next to that island.Toonka had said the following about the Sound of the Wind in the novel.< \u201cIt is a quiet but chaotic power.\u201d >It was exactly what Cale was looking for.A power that would allow him to quickly and quietly run away while causing chaos for the strong. Cale started to slightly smile in anticipation of tomorrow morning.That smirk soon changed to a full-on smile that was full of satisfaction.\u201cYoung master-nim! Uncle Beacrox made this seafood just for you!\u201d\u201cUncle is very excited about the sea!\u201d\u201cRight! Cale-nim, please eat a lot!\u201dCale looked at the ten wolf children bringing food to his room with satisfaction.He had told the others that they were Lock\u2019s cousins and that they all lived in the same village when their families were killed by bandits.Cale\u2019s smile became even thicker. It was not because he liked the ten of them. Cale\u2019s eyes were focused on Beacrox, who was bringing trays of food behind the children.Ron\u2019s son, a chef, and a torture expert. \u00a0That was Beacrox. He usually wore clothes without any wrinkles nor even a speck of dust.It was the same right now. However, he had serious bags under his eyes.\u201cPlease eat, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cGreat, thanks. It was a good decision to have you all help Beacrox in the kitchen.\u201dCale thanked Maes, the twelve-year-old who was the eldest of the 10 wolf children, before picking up his fork.\u2018Young master-nim, we want to work. Lock hyung told us we cannot leech off of you.\u201dThe wolf children, with Maes in the lead,had rushed into his carriage during their journey and asked him to put them to work. That was when Cale had them start assisting Beacrox.\u2018Mm, we think it will be better if we train with the knights, but we will still do our best.\u2019The 12-year-old Maes was confident and calm, unlike Lock. He was also very aware of the strengths of the Wolf Tribe. That was why Cale was even more adamant about their helping Beacrox in the kitchen\u2018You are still children. It is still too early to do something dangerous like training with the knights. Help Beacrox with the kitchen stuff.\u2019\u2018You really are like Lock hyung mentioned. Yes, we will do our best.\u2019The children who said that they will work hard really did work hard. Maybe that was why, but Cale couldn\u2019t help but smirk at Beacrox, who seemed to get more tired each and every day. Beacrox just stood there while the wolf children set up the table and then headed out.\u201cUncle, are you not coming?\u201dThe wolf children were bright and pure. They called Beacrox uncle and treated him like family.\u201c...I\u2019m coming.\u201dThe children headed out first after hearing his comment. All of them were dressed cleanly and had their hair well kept, as if they never lived in a remote village before.It was inevitable with Beacrox\u2019s style.\u2018Now that I think about it, he would be a really good babysitter.\u2019Cale avoided Beacrox\u2019s gaze, thinking that Beacrox would come at him with his cooking knife if he knew what Cale was thinking about. Beacrox was living as a clean and respectful chef right now. He could not be cold to the wolf children.All he could do was glare at Cale every so often.Cale watched Beacrox pick up a fork and knife and start to leave the room as he started to speak.\u201cThanks for always giving me a delicious meal.\u201d\u201c...Yes sir.\u201dClick.Beacrox left the room and closed the door behind him. Cale looked at the door and started to speak.\u201cI don\u2019t know why he is trying to do his dad\u2019s job while his dad is gone.\u201dThere was no reason for Beacrox to bring the food to him. However, Beacrox was slowly doing Ron\u2019s work at any chance he got. Sadly, this prevented Cale from being able to enjoy the gap left from Ron\u2019s departure.The wolf children or Beacrox always showed up to take Ron\u2019s spot.Cale looked toward the corner of the room next and continued speaking.\u201cCome eat.\u201d\u201cCale\u2019s meal buddies, On, Hong, and the Black Dragon, rushed to the table and started to eat. Cale looked out at the sunset over the ocean as he leisurely ate his dinner.The next day.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, young master-nim.\u201dCale exchanged greetings with an old man.This was a fisherman who had roamed across this Ubarr sea and battled against the whirlpool for tens of years. This old man, who was known as the greatest veteran of the Ubarr sea in this small seaside village, had a very tan skin that represented just how much time he spent out at sea.\u201cJust trust me. I will safely take you to the central island.\u201dAmiru, who was next to Cale, nodded her head and added on.\u201cRight. He is an amazing individual, so you will be able to get to anywhere in the Ubarr sea as long as he is with you. I\u2019m sorry I cannot go with you even though I\u2019m supposed to show you around. I have some work to do.\u201d\u201cThat is okay. It is enough that you have introduced me to an expert fisherman.\u201dIt would be complicated if Amiru went with him. Cale had already determined the people who would go with him today. The fisherman asked.\u201cIs it just the three of you?\u201d\u201cYes. Let us go.\u201d\u201cYes sir. Please get on.\u201dCale got on the small but sturdy boat. The Vice Captain got on behind him. Since the Vice Captain will be with him, Cale did not need to take any other knights with him. It really shouldn\u2019t be a problem though, since the islands were uninhabited.\u201cPlease be safe, young master.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dDeputy butler Hans had On and Hong in his arms as he watched Cale off. The kittens On and Hong were flailing around, trying to get away from Hans, who was getting closer to the water. Although they liked the smell of the sea, On and Hong did not like water.- I will be flying.Naturally, the Black Dragon was planning on following them while remaining invisible. Cale joked with the last person getting on the boat.\u201cBeacrox, apparently the nets near the island tend to catch a lot of rare seafood. It will be great to broaden your palate.\u201d\u201c...Thank you very much, young master Cale.\u201dBeacrox, who ended up going with them at Cale\u2019s order, got onto the boat with a stiff expression. Cale ordered the fisherman once everybody was on board.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dThe fisherman, the captain of this small boat, started to row with his son. In this whirlpool filled sea, neither a large ship nor acceleration magic was important.It was safer to be with an experienced fisherman and rely on their years of rowing experience.\u201cThe boat may rock quite a bit, so please hold on tightly.\u201dThe old man casually announced as the boat departed. Cale started to curse soon after they left.\u201cShit.\u201dThe boat was rocking. The boat was just barely avoiding the whirlpool that seemed like it would suck everything in. The force of the whirlwind was rocking the boat a lot.Splash, rash.All sorts of water smashing sounds rang in Cale\u2019s ears as the old fisherman shouted.\u201cHahaha. Young master-nim, isn\u2019t the whirlpool grand?\u201dThe fisherman was a very courageous man. Cale pushed away the hand of the Vice Captain who was grabbing onto his clothes with a pale expression.He was feeling seasick.1. TL: Yet he got shipwrecked...clearly didn\u2019t survive the sea\u2026(PR: Perservering = Survival)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51: Into the Whirlpool (2)Cale looked out through the small window on the boat. [1]\u00a0The color of the violent water was not transparent at all. It was white and blue as it reflected the bottom of the sea, and became a darker and darker shade of blue as it got closer to the center of the whirlpool.\u2018You\u2019d probably die if you get caught in it.\u2019Cale thought about the new magic bombs in the magic box back in his residence. He then turned his gaze toward the front and looked toward the smallest island of the cluster of islands in front of him.\u201cYoung master-nim, it is that island over there! The whirlpool in front of that island is the worst! You\u2019ll need to say goodbye to this world immediately if you get caught in that one! Hahaha!\u201dThe fisherman was really gutsy. He didn\u2019t even see the Vice Captain\u2019s face turn paler as he continued to speak.Cale held back the feeling of needing to vomit and paid attention to the fisherman\u2019s words.\u201cThere is a legend that says that the whirlpool appeared because of a thief who stole something from a god, but, aiya!\u201dThe boat leaned to one side. Cale gulped after seeing the water crash against the boat\u2019s window.\u201cAigoo, the boat almost tipped over. Hey punk, row properly!\u201d\u201cSorry dad!\u201dThe fishing dad and son duo really were gutsy.\u201cThat is why, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dIn the end, Cale raised his hand to stop the old man and sternly started to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s talk after making it to that island first.\u201d\u201cThat is what lady Amiru said as well! We are almost there.\u201dThe old man skillfully started to row. The boat that was moving as he continued to row somehow twisted and turned to avoid all of the whirlpools. Cale observed each and every one of the whirlpools they passed.\u2018The marks of the wind vomited out by the Sound of the Wind.\u2019The ancient power called, \u2018The Sound of the Wind,\u2019 created wind, \u2018tops,\u2019 and spun them as strong as it could. And, as time went on, those tops created new tops, leading to the numerous whirlpools visible today.\u201cY, young master, I, I\u2019m supposed to be protecting you.. Ugh.\u201dCale ignored the Vice Captain\u2019s words as he clenched onto the boat\u2019s handles. He did not want to drown to death.Finally, the boat arrived at an island and Cale could once again feel the ground underneath his feet.\u201cWe have arrived. It was easier than usual.\u201dThe fisherman\u2019s son nodded at his father\u2019s words. Cale looked past the two of them to see the Vice Captain leaning over.\u201cBaaaarf.\u201dThe Vice Captain was suffering from such severe seasickness that Cale wondered if he may end up dying. Cale tapped Beacrox\u2019s arm as Beacrox walked by him and pointed to the Vice Captain. Beacrox frowned before taking out a pair of white gloves from his pocket and putting them on as he headed over to the Vice Captain.Cale flinched a bit once he saw the white gloves.\u2018Aren\u2019t those the gloves that he uses for torture to keep himself clean?\u2019Beacrox seemed to have an endless supply of those white gloves. After observing the existence of these white gloves for the first time, Cale stopped looking at Beacrox and the Vice Captain and looked around the island.There was no sand on this island, instead, it was surrounded by rocks. If you looked a bit farther in from the shoreline, you could see a small forest as well. Well, it is probably more accurate to call it a garden than a forest since they said you should be able to walk all around it in less than an hour.\u201cOld man.\u201d\u201cYes, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cContinue your story from earlier, the one about the thief.\u201dThe old man stopped watching his son anchor the boat and pointed to the path they took to get here. He was pointing at the large whirlpool in front of this island.\u201cA long time ago, there was a thief who was faster than anybody else. The thief\u2019s steps were so light and cautious that, supposedly, he could walk on water without causing the smallest of ripples.\u201dIt really was the Sound of the Wind. Of course, walking on water was a bit of an exaggeration.\u201cAnyways, the thief supposedly stole something that belonged to a god. The legend says that the thief jumped off the Cliff of Winds with the items. You know which cliff that is, right? That was how the god\u2019s item and the thief disappeared from this world, as well as how the whirlpools came to exist.\u201dThe old man smiled as gently as the tanned wrinkles on his arms.\u201cThat is why there used to be sacrifices in the past for the god\u2019s item.\u201d\u201cNot anymore?\u201d\u201cIf it really was a god\u2019s item, why would that god bother us humans instead of taking back his item?\u201dCale agreed with the old man.It was not a god\u2019s item. It was a human\u2019s power. That was why a god could not take it.\u201cThen I will look around the island now.\u201d\u201cYes sir. I will be waiting for you here.\u201dThe old man headed toward his son as the Vice Captain jumped up.\u201cYoung master-nim, me too, ugh.\u201dHe then curled back down. Cale clicked his tongue and motioned for Beacrox to come over. Once Beacrox arrived, Cale whispered in Beacrox\u2019s ear.\u201cSince you are Ron\u2019s son, I\u2019m sure you are also not normal.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dCale patted the not even slightly nervous Beacrox\u2019s shoulder and continued to speak.\u201cYou hold the Vice Captain here.\u201d\u201c...Will you be okay on your own?\u201d\u201cWhat could be dangerous over here? I also have my shield.\u201d\u201cPlease be safe.\u201dBeacrox agreed to follow Cale\u2019s order without much issue. This was why Cale had brought Beacrox with him. He needed someone around him for the time being, someone who was strong, but did not feel extremely determined to protect him. It also had to be someone he could boss around.That was why Beacrox was perfect.\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dCale headed to the forest at the center of the island.\u201cPlease shoot your shield up into the air if you are in danger.\u201d\u201cYoung master-nim, I will be right behind, ugh.\u201dCale just half listened to Beacrox and the Vice Captain as he walked into the forest. He then quietly spoke as soon as he was away from the others.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThe Black Dragon answered back.\u201cAs you mentioned, there is something underneath that whirlpool in front of this island. It was similar to the power from that cave from last time.\u201dThe Black Dragon was talking about when Cale earned the Vitality of the Heart. Cale leisurely entered into the forest. There was no reason to look inside. He really just came here to look at the whirlpool.\u2018I do need to know a bit about the terrain, since we will be flying back here at night.\u2019Cale asked one more thing.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here, right?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201dThere was nobody else other than Cale\u2019s group on the island. Cale could finally sigh in relief. He had been worried about the pod of whales from yesterday.\u201cBut there is a corpse.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCale instantly froze up. He started to frown and looked up into the sky. The Black Dragon removed his invisibility and appeared in front of Cale.\u201cWhen I looked down on this island earlier, there were three corpses on the other side of the island.\u201dCorpses were completely out of Cale\u2019s expectations. Cale took three steps back toward the boat. He had a bad feeling that something unlucky would happen if he continued to walk toward the other side of the island. However, the Black Dragon continued to speak.\u201cBut the corpses were not human corpses.\u201dCale lifted his hands up to cover his eyes. If it was not human, that meant that they had a distinct feature. However, they also did not resemble animals.\u2018So they are similar to humans, but not the same.\u2019Then there was only one answer left.\u201cWere their hands and feet weird?\u201dThe Black Dragon energetically nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right! The hand and feet were weird. They looked like fins!\u201dFins. That was the symbol of the mermaids.A pod of whales and mermaids. Cale was worried and full of doubt. The whales and mermaids were not supposed to show up just yet.\u2018No.\u2019Cale quickly fixed his train of thought. The battle between the Whale Tribe and the mermaids had a history that was even longer than the oldest human wars. However, the moment when this was revealed in the novel was when Choi Han became involved with the Whale Tribe.Cale called toward the Black Dragon.\u201cHey, you.\u201d\u201c...Do not call me you.\u201d\u201cThen what should I call you?\u201d\u201cYou will soon find out.\u201d\u2018What the hell is he talking about?\u2019Cale just thought that the Black Dragon who had been studying the human language lately would pick a name for himself, so he simply pointed toward the other side of the island with his chin.\u201cAre you sure there is nobody there?\u201d\u201cThere are no living presence. It is the same in the water.\u201d\u201cThen lead the way.\u201dHe had to go check out the mermaid corpses. Just to verify and keep himself out of danger.\u201cYou have to be in front of me.\u201dCale pushed the Black Dragon in front of him as they headed toward the other side of the island. He then started to frown as soon as he came out of the other side of the forest and saw the corpses.\u201c...I was right.\u201dAx expected, they were mermaid corpses. To be specific, there were three corpses, all with their necks broken. Furthermore, their legs and arms were twisted as well. Cale frowned even more after seeing the appearance of the mermaids with his own eyes instead of just as text in a novel.The corpses were completely dry, as if they were mummies. However, the mermaids really did look different from humans.There were fins on their hands and feet, while their skin seemed to be covered in scales. They also had gills instead of ears.\u201cWhy are you not getting closer?\u201dThe Black Dragon curiously asked Cale, who was observing from a distance. Cale easily answered back to the Black Dragon.\u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d\u201c...Right. I forgot that you are a weak human.\u201dThe Black Dragon nodded and headed toward the mermaid corpses. He then started to mumble to himself.\u201cIt seems like they were flattened to death. They also seem to have died not too long ago. Furthermore, I can see some red blood underneath their fins. I think they were in a battle.\u201d\u2018It was a whale. A whale definitely killed these mermaids.\u2019The Whale Tribe had a small population, similar to the dragons, but they were the strongest existence in the ocean. That was how they were able to protect the ocean world from the mermaids.The mermaids wanted to create a kingdom inside the ocean. However, the Whale Tribe did not accept sharing their territory with others. It was because they were a species that needed to migrate along with the weather. [2]\u2018The Whale Tribe is small in number, but they are too strong for the mermaids to do as they please. However, the mermaids suddenly started to get stronger.\u2019The mermaids started to get stronger, putting the Whale Tribe in a difficult situation. That was when Choi Han appeared and assisted the whales. At least, that was the contents of the novel by the end of volume 5.Cale told the Black Dragon that they should head back and turned away from the mermaid corpses.\u201cCan we just leave them like this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA mermaid corpse will not dissipate on land, instead, it will just dry out almost entirely. In order for it to dissipate, it needs to be under water. Once that happens, the smell is spread throughout the ocean, signaling other mermaids to come to get the corpses.That was why the Whale Tribe left them on land like this on purpose.\u2018I need to quickly take care of things and leave too.\u2019There was probably only one member of the Whale Tribe who fought these mermaids. If there were two of them, they wouldn\u2019t have left these corpses on land. They would have thrown them into the water in order to draw even more mermaids over and battle it out. They chose to act like this because they were alone.Cale headed back to the boat and talked to the others.\u201cLet\u2019s go back. There\u2019s not much to see.\u201dThe Vice Captain, who was finally starting to recover from his seasickness, turned pale again, but Beacrox seemed to have bought a lot of fish from the fisherman, as he happily responded.\u201cYoung master Cale, We will have roasted fish for dinner.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dAfter returning to the residence, Cale was waiting for the time to pass with a stomach full of roasted fish. Once darkness finally descended on the small village, he took out some scuba gear from the magic box he got from Billos.Cale stood on the window sill facing the Cliff of Winds and the Northeastern sea as he started to talk to On and Hong.\u201cKeep a good watch at home.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t let anybody in.\u201d\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201dCale just nodded his head to respond to the baby kittens before looking toward the Black Dragon.The Black Dragon looked toward Cale with confidence and casually called out a spell.\u201cFlight.\u201dAt that moment, Cale\u2019s body floated up into the air.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe Black Dragon took the lead and Cale followed behind him. Cale was carrying a magic bomb as they flew high in the air in order to avoid getting noticed.Cale\u2019s plan today was to hit the whirlpool accurately before running. By the time people came out in shock, Cale would have already disappeared like the soundless wind.This Black Dragon\u2019s version of the magic bomb was scheduled to go off ten minutes later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then started to think.\u2018Toonka really is a crazy bastard.\u2019How did Toonka end up getting the Sound of the Wind in the novel? He was shipwrecked and arrived on this island, and then starts to show interest in this whirlpool when his condition got a bit better.Volcanoes, glaciers, desert, this bastard who liked to crash against the elements with just his body could not help but be interested in this ocean whirlpool.Toonka enjoyed dangerous situations. No, he was obsessed with them. That was why Cale was calling him a crazy bastard.< \u201cIt\u2019s my first time in the ocean, but it looks fun.\u201d >Toonka said that before jumping into that whirlpool without any preparations. Naturally, Cale had no plans to act in the same manner.Cale had already packed everything he needed in the scuba gear\u2019s pockets.\u201cIs it here?\u201dCale nodded to answer the Black Dragon\u2019s question and looked around. Maybe it was because it was a country village, but the entire village was dark at night.The ocean was even darker. But it was much louder than the village from the sound of the whirlpool. The fact that it would get louder will not draw any attention. They will just think it is the whirlpool being weird and forget about it.Cale turned away from the ocean and looked toward the Cliff of Winds.< Toonka discovers a hidden cave underneath the Cliff of Winds and enters with curiosity. He finds something at the end of the Cave and lets out a laugh.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a good thing to be here.\u201dIt was a fateful encounter that Toonka had never even expected. >Cale put aside the information from the novel and spoke to the Black Dragon.\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d\u201cAlright, human.\u201dBlack mana started to come out of the Black Dragon\u2019s short front paw.Ooooong.The magic bomb reacted to the mana and started to vibrate.The magic bomb in Cale\u2019s arms was not the magic bomb used by the secret organization in volumes 1 and 2 of the novel.\u2018It is a much better magic bomb.\u2019Around the second half of volume 3, the mages of the Whipper Kingdom, who were pushed to the brink, start to develop new tools to fight against the non-mages.One of those tools was similar to the magic bomb in Cale\u2019s hand.The condensed mana, which is the main ingredient of the magic bomb, reacts to the developer\u2019s mana and divides into multiple smaller mana balls before exploding.It wasn\u2019t as strong, but the chain of explosions was useful to kill even more enemies.Cale complimented the Black Dragon.\u201cYou must be amazing to create such a thing.\u201d\u201cYes. I am a great and mighty dragon.\u201dEven more black mana flowed out of those short paws and disappeared into the bombs.Ooooooong.Cale could feel the magic bombs vibrating in his arms. Cale was aiming for the moment when the moon had set but the sun had not yet risen.\u201cBe careful, do not get hurt.\u201dThe Black Dragon headed higher into the air as he put a shield around Cale and said bye.Click.A small noise sounded from inside the magic bomb.Cale released the bomb from his hand and then put on the scuba mask. It was a magic tool that will allow him to breathe underwater for 5 minutes.A few moments later.Boom! Boom! Booooooom!The bomb went off and Cale summoned the silver shield before falling straight down. The night wind rushed fiercely past his face.Once the tens of smaller explosions went off, the whirlpool lost its strength and could no longer spin properly. Cale opened up the wings of the shield.Splaaaaaash!The shield clashed with the ocean as Cale dove underwater. He put on some goggles and headed to the bottom of the ocean. Thanks to the shield, Cale\u2019s body was quickly sinking like an arrow.Boom, boom! Even more explosions were going off and making the whirlpool lose even more strength. The shockwaves created from the explosions touched Cale\u2019s shield and silver wings, but Cale still managed to safely arrive at the bottom of the ocean.Boom!Cale used the shield once more to easily handle the last explosion, before starting to walk on the ocean floor.The small central island and the large whirlpool in front of it.That whirlpool was caused by a small top that was underneath a large boulder.This top had continued to spin for hundreds of years without stopping.Cale could see that large boulder in front of him. It was so large that Cale thought it could easily crush a person.< Toonka realized that the whirlpool started from underneath this large boulder and grabbed the boulder. It was because it was smaller than the boulder he had lifted up north. However, he was not able to lift this boulder up. >< \u2019Then I\u2019ll just break it. >< That was why Toonka destroyed the boulder. >Cale looked toward the boulder and started to think.\u2018Toonka, you crazy bastard. You destroyed this thing?\u2019Cale shook his head underneath the water and headed toward the top that resembled Sun Wukong underneath the boulder.\u00a0[1]At that moment, just like every other time when he had gained an ancient power, the former owner\u2019s voice appeared.You sons of bitches!Oh. This owner was quite the potty mouth.Why is it a sin to steal something that they sacrificed people to create? Especially when I was just going to return it to the people? You trash bastards! Why do bastards like you have such power?!The owner of the Sound of the Wind was that same thief that was said to have stolen something from a god. She had not truly stolen a god\u2019s item. In reality, she had just stolen something from a temple.She had suffocated after becoming trapped underneath this large boulder. The silent thief with the quickest feet met her demise like this.This superpower to control the wind was different than mana. She herself was the wind. After her death, she had become a top that continued to vomit out whirlpools.This stupid water! If my friend\u2019s light was here, it would burn it all!Cale\u2019s expression turned odd as he was taking out the items to free this top.\u2018Light? Is it perhaps?\u2019Do you know why lightning is so scary? It is because all it takes is a single streak, JUST ONE STREAK!Cale started to think about the last ancient power on his list, the, \u2018Fire of Destruction.\u2019 He had to pass through fire to get to it, and had to have a ton of money with him as well.A sudden thought crossed through Cale\u2019s mind.The Indestructible Shield, wood. Vitality of the Heart, Wind. Sound of the Wind, Water. Fire of Destruction, Fire.Cale was having a bad feeling about this. He even debated whether or not he really should take this power. However.Beep- beep- beep-The alarm inside the scuba gear was informing him that he only had three minutes left. Cale decided to think about this later.\u2018Let\u2019s hurry and take it out.\u2019He started to dig with a hoe. He was trying to get rid of this obstacle that was holding both the large boulder and the top. This hoe, that was reinforced with magic, was so sharp that the floor easily gave way.\u2018There\u2019s no reason to be an idiot like Toonka and destroy the boulder.\u2019He just had to dig. Cale started to smirk. He could finally see the entire top after digging a bit longer. Cale reached toward the top and grabbed it with his hand.Swiiiiiiiish.Cale moved a couple steps backward with the top spinning in his hand.Booooom.The boulder that had been in perfect balance with the top started to lean to one side.If it was a sin that I stole it, why do they claim to not be sinners when they lied to the humans? This world is rotten! It is a rotten world where those in power can do whatever the fuck they want!\u2018The world has always been rotten.\u2019Cale ignored the thief\u2019s rant and put the top down on the ground.There was only one thing the owner of the Sound of the Wind wanted.Freedom. The only way to provide that was to destroy the top.Crack.The top broke into pieces under Cale\u2019s foot.Shriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiek-A sharp noise like a screech echoed under the water as the top broke. The wind that poured out of the broken top started to surround Cale.You have the power of recovery. Don\u2019t get caught like I did. Got it?\u2018The power of recovery? Is she talking about the Vitality of the Heart?\u2019Cale started to frown as the thief said her final words.Be free.Swooooosh.A white wind surrounded Cale\u2019s body and moved up to his head before starting to move downward. It would do this until it reached his feet before stopping there.\u2018Hmm?\u2019But the wind instead roamed around his heart.Boom. Boom. Boom.Cale\u2019s heart suddenly started to beat wildly.\u2018Ugh.\u2019Cale\u2019s heart was beating so much that it hurt. Cale patted his heart with his right hand as air bubbles came out of his mouth that forcefully opened because of the pain.\u2018What is going on?\u2019\u2018Ugh.\u2019Cale held back another moan and curled up his body. At that moment, the wind flashed, before instantly moving down to his feet and drawing an image on his ankle. Cale could see the image of a whirlpool in the gap between the scuba suit and the scuba shoes.This whirlpool was also silver in color.Once the whirlpool image was completed, Cale could finally feel his heart calming down.\u2018Did the Vitality of the Heart strengthen the Sound of the Wind as well?\u2019He was curious, but did not have any time to think about it.Beep, beep-The alarm rang once again to let him know that not much time was left.However, he still had plenty of time.Cale activated the Sound of the Wind and a gust of wind started to swirl around his feet.Cale lightly moved one foot forward.Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish!Cale\u2019s body instantly cut through the water. Although the large whirlpool in front of the central island was gone, the other whirlpools were still existent. However, Cale easily moved past them without any issue.\u2018The other whirlpools will disappear within a week.\u2019However, Cale was planning on maintaining those whirlpools for about a year. The whirlpools recognized the Sound of the Wind, the symbol of their owner, and made way for Cale.His destination was the Cliff of Winds.Cale watched the cliff quickly get closer and kicked off the ground before he got too close. His body shot upward in reaction.Swiiiiiiiiiish-The ocean breeze welcomed Cale as he came back above water. Cale quickly took off the scuba mask and threw it aside.Beep-The alarm went off to sound that five minutes were up.Cale looked toward the village and saw that quite a lot of lights were starting to turn on.\u201cI need to hurry.\u201dHans probably wouldn\u2019t come to wake him up because he said to not bother him unless it was a matter of life or death, but it was still better to return quickly.Cale swam toward the Cliff of Winds and noticed large and small boulders underneath the cliff. These boulders were the reason that anybody who fell off the cliff to their death ended up with mauled up corpses.Cale looked to find the boulder that resembled the head of a lion. It was easy to find because it was the largest boulder in the area.Cale then started to smile after seeing the small cave behind the boulder.\u2018Found it.\u2019Toonka had a fateful encounter in this cave after earning the Sound of the Wind. It was something useless for Toonka, but it was an \u2018ingredient\u2019 that Cale would put to good use in the future.If this ingredient was combined with the ingredient that Lock will acquire for Cale in the future, the Queen of the Jungle will have no choice but to make a deal with Cale.\u2018The queen needs to save the jungle.\u2019Cale carefully swam past the boulders and entered the cave. The cave entrance was dark because the moon had already set, but it did not matter. Cale entered the cave and quickly jumped out of the water.He then looked up at the sky outside.\u2018It\u2019s about time he arrived.\u2019The Black Dragon immediately started to speak, as if he had read Cale\u2019s mind. However, the Black Dragon was speaking inside Cale\u2019s mind.Weak human, you are not hurt.There was only one reason for the Black Dragon to talk inside Cale\u2019s head. Cale started to get the chills. He slowly turned his head toward the inside of the cave.The Black Dragon only spoke into Cale\u2019s head when there was someone unfamiliar nearby.There is a lifeform inside this cave. Although it is almost dead, thankfully, it is not a corpse that you fear.Pssssssss. Pssssssss.Cale could hear something dragging inside the cave and started to contemplate his choices.\u2018Jump back into the water? Or ask the Dragon to take me home right now?\u2019Psssssssss. Pssssssss. Pssss.But that dragging noise became more urgent and the lifeform revealed itself before Cale could make up his mind. Cale put one foot back into the water.The lifeform that revealed itself started to speak in a shaking voice.\u201cP, please save me.\u201dAh. A gasp came out of Cale\u2019s mouth. The lifeform had a salty smell to it. It was the smell of the sea.\u2018No way.\u2019\u201cThere is something I must accomplish. I, cannot, d, die here!\u201dA human looking existence, with its horrendously scratched up leg dragging behind it, approached Cale.There was a green fluid on the scratches that made the existence continue to vomit up blood. That was clearly the work of a mermaid.\u201cP, please-.\u201dIt was a whale.This beautiful human with messy hair that was crawling toward Cale with his hands, was a whale.Weak human, did you catch a cold? Your face is pale.The Black Dragon was talking into Cale\u2019s mind, but Cale could not hear it. Cale felt like he was facing a scene straight out of a horror movie.An injured, almost dead, member of the Whale Tribe had revealed himself to Cale.Teaser1.\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_WukongPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He also seemed to be putting strength into his hands, as Cale could see the Whale\u2019s fingers digging into the ground. His strength was unbelievable even though he seemed to be close to death.He had a single question on his mind.\u2018A Whale tribe member being hurt by mermaid poison?\u2019An answer quickly floated across Cale\u2019s mind.Mixed blood.That was the only possible answer.Cale quickly thought through the contents of, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 There were no mixed-blood characters in the Whale Tribe that was almost as low in number as the dragons.\u2018But there was one that died.\u2019Cale started to frown and worry.\u201cUgh.\u201dThe Whale could not crawl anymore. His body started to shake without being able to do anything else. At that moment, Cale heard the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head.- Human, are you not going to help?The Black Dragon doubtingly asked. Cale did not answer the question and stood up. He hated useless feelings and reaching out a helping hand for no reason. However.\u201cHey.\u201dCale approached the mixed blood Whale and crouched in front of him. The Whale human who was shaking on the ground slowly lifted his head.This long-haired man really lived up to the stories about how the Whales were so beautiful that they made elves look like squids. Such a beautiful man was looking at Cale.\u201c...Save-\u201dCale answered without any sort of emotion in his voice.\u201cYes. I\u2019ll save you.\u201dA mixed-blood Whale human. Cale knew that it might be more painful for this Whale to be alive than to die in the next few moments. He was sure that the Whale knew this to be true as well. [1]Cale recalled the conversation the Whale King had with Lock in the novel.< \u201cYou are a pure-blooded Wolf.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cMy child is not of pure blood.\u201d\u201cHmm? Noona is not a pure blooded Whale?\u201d\u201cNot that child. I had a son who was mixed-blood. That was why \u2026 he had a lot of difficulties. He was too weak to live in the ocean.\u201d\u201cThen does he live on land?\u201d\u201cNo. That terrible son of mine left this world before me.\u201d >The Whale Tribe\u2019s king and mediator of the ocean was someone with blue hair and blue eyes. Although Cale could not tell for sure because it was dark, the face of the Whale looking at him right now was slightly similar to the face of the Whale King as described in the novel.Cale looked toward the sea-like blue eyes and started to speak.\u201cSleep for a bit. Everything will be fine when you wake back up.\u201dThe blue eyes blinked a couple of time before slowly closing. Cale watched the unconscious mixed-blood Whale for a bit, before approaching and inspecting his legs.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThe Black Dragon revealed itself once the mixed-blood Whale became unconscious and quickly approached the Whale. He then created a small light ball with magic so that they could take a better look at the leg.\u201cIt is a mess.\u201dThe Whale Tribe\u2019s skin is very thick and tough. Although their skin looked flawless and beautiful, it was also extremely tough. Sadly, this mixed-blood Whale did not have such a luxury. That was why it was impacted by a mermaid\u2019s attack and poisoned. The Black Dragon watched Cale with an odd expression on it\u2019s face as Cale inspected the Whale.\u201c...You are a very weird human. You are so weak and weird.\u201d\u201cEnough nonsense.\u201dCale pointed to the Whale and ordered the Black Dragon.\u201cDunk him in the water.\u201d\u201c...Did you lie to him?\u201dThe Black Dragon seemed completely shocked. The shocked expression of this reptile looked pretty serious.\u201cHuman, you said you were going to save him! You are weak, but you have kept all of your promises until now! So why are you telling me to dunk him in the water?! Are you trying to make him suffocate to death?!\u201dSigh.Cale let out a deep sigh. He then grabbed that light ball that was floating in the air. It was not hot.\u201cI\u2019m doing it to save him.\u201dHe then added on.\u201cAfter you put him in the water, you remember the corpses from earlier, right?\u201d\u201c...Just what are you trying to make me do?\u201d\u201cNothing much. Just go and bring me back one arm.\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s jaws dropped. Cale did not care about this and headed into the cave. It was because the Black Dragon didn\u2019t say no, even though it looked completely shocked.\u201c...I will do as you asked for now.\u201dThe Black Dragon really was obedient. Cale did not look back and continued to walk forward. He needed to take care of it and return back before the village became rowdy.The cave was not deep, and Cale reached the end quickly.\u2018Found it.\u2019The fateful encounter that Toonka had found was a \u2018Small Puddle.\u2019 Cale took out one of the items he brought with him. It was an alarm device. It would let Cale know if someone else got close to this location.\u2018I just need to take it with me before I leave.\u2019Cale scooped a bit of that puddle into a small glass bottle.\u2018Fire-Suppressing Water.\u2019Water is always strong against fire, but the strength of this water was a bit different. If Cale dunked the item Lock will procure for him into this water, it will give birth to a very precious item.It will become a treasure that will save the drying jungle.Cale returned back to the cave entrance. The Black Dragon seemed to have already returned with the arm, as he handed the arm to Cale with an iffy expression. Cale could also see the drenched mixed-blood Whale boy as well.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe Black Dragon sighed before levitating the mixed-blood Whale, the mermaid arm, and Cale before floating back home.Cale received an overwhelming welcome from On and Hong as soon as he returned.\u201cYou came at the right time!\u201d\u201cThe butler has been banging on the door for a while!\u201dCale could tell even without the kittens telling him. He could hear Hans\u2019s voice outside the door. Hans sounded like he was ready to cry.\u201cYoung master, I dare not enter because you said you\u2019ll kill me if you wake you up. That is why I can only continue to bang on the door. Can you please open the door young master?\u201dCale took off the scuba suit and threw it to a corner before taking a device out of the magic box and throwing it toward the Black Dragon. He then put on a bathrobe and opened the door.\u201cYoung master, young lady Amiru asked me to verify that you were safe. So please wake up and open-\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cOh! Young master! \u2026 Were you washing?\u201dCale swept back his wet hair and leisurely answered Hans\u2019s question.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I was sitting in the sea water bath.\u201d\u201cAh, you were in the bathroom. Then I shouldn\u2019t have to worry about my life, since you were not sleeping.\u201d\u201c...I wonder.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, young master-nim.\u201dAhem, hem. Hans let out some fake coughs before inspecting Cale and starting to speak.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere? It is quite a mess outside right now. There were a few loud explosions earlier. I believe something has happened out at sea.\u201dCale looked out the window he entered through. The village was completely lit now, even though it was the middle of the night. He could also see some lights heading out to sea.Amiru seemed to have made a brave decision to send people out at sea, even with the dangers of the whirlpools, because the development was right around the corner.\u201cThere was a loud noise, but they haven\u2019t determined what caused it?\u201d\u201cYoung lady Amiru said people will be heading out to sea. I believe it will be figured out soon enough.\u201dIn Cale\u2019s opinion, Amiru was going to be happy because the whirlpool by the central island had disappeared. That alone would increase the value of this shoreline exponentially.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cThen you can leave now.\u201dHans respectfully bowed to Cale before quickly heading out. At the same time, the Black Dragon turned off the invisibility device, revealing himself and the unconscious mixed-blood Whale, along with the mermaid arm on top of him.On and Hong did not move from the corner of the room after seeing the mermaid arm. These kittens were scared of a lot of stupid things.Cale headed to the bathroom and scooped up some of the sea water from the bath. The Black Dragon watched with curiosity as Cale dunked one side of the mermaid arm into the sea water.Sizzle-A burning noise could be heard, but, in reality, the dried up arm was quickly returning to normal. The corpse\u2019s swift change made On and Hong run and hide underneath the bed. The corpse arm returned completely back to normal in another moment. Cale looked toward the Whale human\u2019s leg. Unlike earlier, the green fluid was mixed with the sea water.Cale took out a knife.At that moment, the unconscious man\u2019s eyelids started to flutter and his body started to twitch.\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to wake up. Human, put the knife away!\u201dThe Black Dragon shouted and the man opened his eyes. The first thing the man saw was Cale lifting the knife up over his head. Cale smiled toward the Whale human in order to tell him to relax once they made eye contact. The Whale human\u2019s eyes started to shake as the knife moved.Stab.The knife stabbed into the mermaid arm and cut through the skin. A fluid started to pour out of the cut arm. It was the mermaid\u2019s blood. Once the arm returned to normal, the blood was restored as well.Cale started to speak to the still shaking man.\u201cGood.\u201dThe blood poured out and fell onto the man\u2019s leg.Sizzle.The green fluid on the man\u2019s leg started to sizzle once it came into contact with the mermaid blood.Cale handed the bleeding arm to the man.\u201cDrink it before the blood dries up. That is the best way.\u201dVolume 5. This was the healing method Rosalyn discovered to heal Lock, who was injured after getting in a fight with a mermaid. It was a method that was still not known in this world.The eyes of this man, who seemed to be in his early 20s, started to shake again. It was the same for On, Hong, and the Black Dragon as well.In the end, the man got better. He had chosen to drink the blood after seeing that the dripped blood from earlier was indeed slowly curing his leg.Cale continued to speak while looking at the confused expression on the mixed-blood Whale\u2019s face.\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you the one who killed this mermaid?\u201dThe man\u2019s expression stiffened up. Cale started to scoff after seeing that expression. It was weird to see the Whale being so anxious after being asked if he had killed a mermaid.Cale then poured the remaining blood back onto the Whale human\u2019s leg, before putting the arm back into the water. The arm started to dissipate inside the water as Cale watched.Cale continued to look at the arm dissipate as he started to speak to the Whale human.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Whale, you probably need to return to the ocean by morning in order to recover completely. Get some sleep and return on your own.\u201dThe man\u2019s face turned cold. It was a different type of viciousness than Choi Han. This was someone who was always looked down upon, someone who was always reminded he was not as good as the rest of his tribe members. This was a viciousness that could only come from such a person.\u201cHow did you know I was a whale?\u201d\u201cWho else could kill three mermaids?\u201d\u201c...I need to return home.\u201dCale felt like he would end up having to listen to a useless story, so he quickly waved his hand.\u201cI have no desire to hear your useless story.\u201dThat was why Cale did not ask for the Whale\u2019s name nor let Hans see the Whale.\u201cI only saved you because I said I would when you asked me to save you.\u201dCale laid down on the bed. He needed to take a shower, but he was too tired for that right now.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep. Be quiet on your way out.\u201dCale closed his eyes. There was nothing he needed to worry about since the dragon was there. He then remembered the last words the Whale King had said to Lock in the novel.< \u201cThat is why I do not want to lose any more family members.\u201d >This was why Kim Rok Soo chose to take action this time. He had experienced losing all of his family members himself. Of course, he had no plans on suffering a loss from this experience.< \u201cIf that child was still alive, I would pass the throne to my daughter and go live in the human world with him. I feel like that child would have been happy if we did that.\u201d\u201cMm, I do think noona would do well as Queen. But since noona is an affectionate person too, wouldn\u2019t she want to live with you too, Mister?\u201d\u201cOf course. She searched the entire ocean when my son disappeared.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the entire ocean would have been flipped over if noona was the one doing the searching. Hey mister, what was your son\u2019s name?\u201d\u201c...My son\u2019s name was Paseton.\u201d >The savior of the king\u2019s son. Whether it is the current Whale King or the future Whale Queen, wouldn\u2019t he be able to use this to his advantage?But, most importantly, the Whale Tribe had to win the war against the mermaids. Cale fell asleep with a calm mind. When he woke up the next morning, Paseton was already gone.The red kitten Hong reported to him.\u201cHe said he\u2019ll be back at night.\u201d\u201cThere really is no reason for him to do-.\u201dCale just shrugged his shoulders without finishing the sentence. However, a moment later, an even bigger feeling of, \u2018was this really necessary,\u2019 filled his mind.\u201cYoung master Cale! I\u2019m sorry for coming over so early, but I needed to share some amazing news with you!\u201dYoung lady Amiru was smiling brightly. It was rare to see the usually calm Amiru this way. She seemed to have come straight from the sea, as she still had a raincoat on and other people were with her.\u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201dCompared to the excited Amiru, Cale was calm. No, he was almost emotionless.\u201cThe whirlpool, the whirlpool in front of the central island has disappeared! It disappeared overnight without even a trace!\u201d\u2018I made that happen.\u2019Cale could not tell her he had done that, so he just looked away. Next to Amiru was the veteran fisherman and some knights, as well as Toonka.As described in the novel, Toonka had long brown hair like a lion\u2019s mane. This man with a dangerous appearance that seemed like he could and would easily send an orc flying with a single slap, clicked his tongue and started to mumble.\u201cHow disappointing. I wanted to try jumping into that whirlpool. Should I jump into a different one instead?\u201dHe definitely was a crazy bastard.At that moment, Amiru started to talk excitedly to Cale once again.\u201cYoung master Cale! In return for the Henituse family\u2019s investment, I want to show you the sight of a peaceful Ubarr sea. Will you go to the central island with me?\u201dCale needed to show some sincerity in this project until someone arrived from the Henituse territory. Cale smiled gently at Amiru and asked.\u201cIs everybody here going over?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe corner of Cale\u2019s lips shook at Amiru\u2019s short answer.Amiru, who did not see that and only saw the gentle smile, pointed to Toonka and continued to speak.\u201cAh, this is your first time seeing this person, right? This is the person who was almost caught up in the whirlpool. Mr. Bob, this is young master Cale Henituse.\u201d\u2018Bob?\u2019Cale had an odd expression on his face.Toonka put a smile on that scary looking mug of his. It was even scarier than seeing an ogre smile.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Bob.\u201dBob. Toonka really used a fitting name for an alias. It was as stupid as him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Amiru calmly started to explain.\u201cBob is from the Whipper Kingdom. He is from a small seaside village and went out to fish when somehow he ended up shipwrecked.\u201d\u201cThat is correct. I just live a simple life fishing by the village. Hahahaha. I do not know how I ended up like this.\u201d\u2018A simple life my ass.\u2019It was unbelievable. Amiru did not know about Cale\u2019s thoughts, as she continued to speak.\u201cThat was why he got on a boat and helped us investigate what happened last night.\u201dAmiru\u2019s eyes were clear as she looked at Toonka. However, when Cale looked around, there were many negative gazes toward Toonka as well.A villager from the Whipper Kingdom. Their gazes showed their true feelings about this barbarian. Cale took a quick glance around before making eye contact with Toonka. Toonka started to smile.\u201cI heard that young master-nim launched a large shield in the capital in order to save everyone. I asked the young lady-nim to bring me with her because I heard that you were a strong person.\u201dToonka\u2019s eyes sharpened at that moment. Cale suddenly had an ominous feeling.\u2018This is getting dangerous.\u2019That was why he immediately responded with the following.\u201cThat is why I am currently in recovery.\u201d\u201c...Recovery?\u201d\u201cYes. It is a not a strong power. It is very weak.\u201dAmiru added on.\u201cYes. Young master Cale overused his power to save everyone. That is why he is touring our territory while he recovers.\u201dAmiru was looking toward Cale with sympathy, admiration, and some other emotions, but Toonka was different.\u201cAh, is that the case?\u201dHe seemed to have lost all interest. He then looked at Cale from head to toe before looking away.\u2018Good. That is how Toonka should act.\u2019Sacrifice for others? A hero? Toonka was not interested in anything like that. All he cared about and obsessed over was strength. He was the type of person who ignored the people on his own side if they were weak, and even killed them if necessary.That was why he was called a tyrant.\u201cThen shall we go?\u201dCale nodded at Amiru\u2019s question. He could then hear Toonka\u2019s mumbling from the side.\u201cThis is weird. I smell a strong person nearby.\u201dHe really was crazy. Cale looked up at the empty ceiling.- I do not smell.Cale could hear the invisible Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head. Toonka\u2019s instincts were even stronger than those of the Beast people. Cale made up his mind that he had to act the weakest he had ever been while he was around Toonka today.***\u201cWe are currently investigating why the whirlpool may have suddenly disappeared. My father and our territory\u2019s mages will all soon arrive as well.\u201dCale looked out at the calm sea by the central island and played along with Amiru.\u201cIs that so? I\u2019m glad. I hope we can quickly figure out what happened.\u201d- You are such a good liar.Cale ignored the Black Dragon\u2019s remark as he looked out to the sea with a calm gaze. It was quite chaotic. All of the village\u2019s fishermen were out here, as well as the people who came out for the construction of the naval base. They were all looking around and discussing with each other. It was even louder because of the other whirlpools that were still going strong nearby. Cale looked out at all of this and added on.\u201cI hope all of the other whirlpools can quickly disappear as well.\u201d- Human, you are lying again. Didn\u2019t you say you will make the whirlpools stay for another year?Cale once again ignored the Black Dragon\u2019s remarks. Amiru nodded at Cale\u2019s words with a determined expression.\u201cYes. We will definitely figure out what happened and get rid of the other whirlpools as well. With such an opportunity in front of our eyes and many people helping us, we need to grasp this opportunity completely.The passionate Amiru made Cale feel a bit sorry for her and he started to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sure you and the Ubarr family will definitely accomplish it, young lady Amiru.\u201d\u201c...Thank you. I feel much better after your affirming words, young master Cale.\u201dAmiru\u2019s warm gaze headed toward Cale as she stood there with a calm smile on her face. Cale responded back to her with a serious expression.\u201cI\u2019m getting a bit dizzy from all this sunlight, may I go rest for a bit underneath the shade?\u201dCale could feel Toonka\u2019s gaze on him from one of the boats. Toonka kept on glancing over toward Cale every so often. He seemed to be still looking for the source of that strong person\u2019s scent. However, there was no way that Toonka would find the Black Dragon. That was the limit of someone who could not feel any aura or mana.\u201cAh, of course. Please rest well, since you are still in recovery. Do not overdo it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dCale leisurely headed to the central island\u2019s forest. Amiru just quietly watched him as he headed toward the shade. This Cale, who was still doing what he was supposed to even when he was in recovery, was definitely different from the Cale of the past. Although he claimed to be ill, he did not look ill at all. He just seemed to be tired.\u201cThat is what makes him amazing.\u201dAs someone who dreamt of presiding over this territory in the future, Amiru though that she needed to become more dependable like Cale. Passion filled her calm gaze as she quickly walked over to the investigators to help.On the other hand, Cale was heading to the other side of the island. Since nobody was over there, it would be a great place to waste time.- Aren\u2019t you afraid of the corpses over there? You are both weak and a coward.Cale ignored the Black Dragon once more as he arrived at the other side of the island. He then stopped moving after taking a look.\u201cWhat the?\u201d- It was not me! I didn't do it!The Black Dragon was passionately denying any blame. However, this time, Cale did not have the luxury of listening to the Black Dragon. He quickly rushed toward the boulder that the mermaid corpses were on the other day. He could not help but stop once he got around it.\u2018... Did Paseton do this?\u2019The boulder was destroyed into pieces.\u201cHow did the mermaid corpses end up like this\u2026\u2026\u201dThe mermaid corpses were turned into dust. Cale could tell these were the corpses only because he had seen them here the other day. Anybody else would just think that it was part of the boulder.This immense strength.This was definitely the work of a Whale.An extremely angry Whale.Splash. Splash.Suddenly, the water started to churn. The Black Dragon started to speak.- Something is shooting up from the bottom of the sea. It is moving very fast!Cale lifted his head and looked toward the sea. He then flinched and stepped backwards.Splaaaaash.Something large rose to the surface. It was a lifeform that was dark grey in color. It then looked straight toward Cale.It was a Whale.A Humpback Whale Beast person.Humpback Whale Beast people were known as the guardians of the ocean and protected the weaker lifeforms. For generations, the Whale Tribe\u2019s King has been a Humpback Whale beast person.Boom. Boom. Boom.Cale\u2019s heart was going while. The Whale\u2019s gaze was filled with both murderous intent and observation, a mix of instinct and rationality. This was the first time Cale had made such direct eye contact with a strong existence that was angry at him. This strong existence was looking down at Cale and inspecting each and every aspect of Cale.It was at that moment.- That stupid Whale must be crazy!The Black Dragon\u2019s angry voice rang inside Cale\u2019s mind. At the same time, a strong power started to cause vibrations in the air. The eyes of the Whale, that had been focused on Cale, turned toward the source of the vibration.- How dare you look at my weak human like that!The mana in the air started to fluctuate and the water started to go wild. However, the Humpback Whale did not move at all. Instead, this 15m long Whale raised its tail and slapped down onto the water.Spaaaaaaash!The water was churning rapidly.This action made Cale certain that this was a beast person.Boom. Boom.Cale calmed his heart, as the Vitality of the Heart had noticed danger and started to pour out its strength. The Indestructible Shield also shot out as well. The ancient powers always put their owner\u2019s lives first. They were ready to go at any point to protect their owners.Cale turned his head toward the empty void where the mana was gathering and was about to speak. However, another voice started to speak first.\u201cI am not trying to fight with you.\u201dIt was a voice that was as beautiful as the Sirens of the greek mythology. Cale turned his head and saw the Humpback Whale completely reveal its head above water.\u201cWow.\u201dA gasp came out of Cale\u2019s mouth. It was very large and scary. He felt like that Whale\u2019s head could easily kill him with a light tap.- Why are you lifting up your stupid head? You\u2019re telling me everything you did until now wasn\u2019t asking for a fight? Puny Whale!Cale let out a sigh at the Black Dragon\u2019s words before reaching out toward the mana. An angry four year old could be quite dangerous.The mana, that seemed ready to destroy anything and everything, gave way to Cale\u2019s hand. The Whale seemed to be shocked at this development.Cale\u2019s hand finally reached something round. It was the dragon\u2019s head. Cale just stoically patted it a few times.\u201cDon\u2019t get angry. You will get hurt.\u201dThe mana started to quickly disappear. Cale then heard a quiet voice.- I will not get hurt. I am strong.\u201cI know, I know. But you still have to be careful.\u201dIt was hard to calm down a four year old child. However, the Black Dragon seemed to have understood what Cale was trying to say.- You should be the one being careful, weak human.The mana disappeared completely. Cale turned away and looked toward the Whale once the mana was gone. The Whale slowly lowered its large head toward Cale. Cale flinched at the size of the head, but managed to stand still. It was because the murderous intent had disappeared from the Whale\u2019s gaze.Once the Humpback Whale lowered its head to right in front of Cale, it started to speak.\u201cI have something to ask-.\u201dAt that moment.A small Whale was swimming like crazy from the far horizon. It was heading toward them. It seemed to be very weak and small compared to this 15m Whale.That Whale quickly approached them and started to shout.\u201cNoona, you cannot bite him and kill him!\u201dThe Humpback Whale in front of Cale quickly turned around.Splaaaaaaash!The sea water splashed from the Whale\u2019s movement and drenched Cale.However, Cale did not have time to think about this. He closed his eyes.\u2018This really must be that Humpback Whale.\u2019The tiny Whale coming toward them was most likely Paseton. That meant that there was only one existence that he would call noona.The current Whale King\u2019s daughter and the future Queen of the Whales.The Whale that was at the vanguard alongside Choi Han and crew in the battle against the mermaids.Cale could see the X shaped scar on the Humpback Whale\u2019s back.Witira.It was definitely her.The large Whale\u2019s face started to turn into a frown. Cale slowly started to move backwards, as he did not want to get involved in this Humpback Whale sibling reunion.The small Whale shouted once more.\u201cHe is someone you must absolutely not kill!\u201dThe Black Dragon confusedly spoke into Cale\u2019s mind again.- What is that small Whale talking about? We are not fighting.Cale felt the same way. Cale was thankful that everybody was too focused on the situation on the other side of the island to hear this small Whale\u2019s voice. Otherwise, everyone would have come here after hearing the small Whale\u2019s shouts.It was not long before the the Whales would meet. However, the Black Dragon casually added on at that time.- By the way, just so you know, there is one more coming.\u2018What? One more?\u2019Cale stopped walking backwards and turned toward the forest.\u201cMuhahahahahah. I smell it, I can smell it!\u201dA crazy bastard whose brown hair looked like a wild lion\u2019s mane appeared.It was Toonka. His eyes looked crazy. He was rushing out of the forest while shouting.\u201cI smell someone strong!\u201dCale crouched down as soon as he saw Toonka. Thanks to that, Toonka and the Humpback Whale made direct eye contact with each other.Cale crawled out of the way before the shrimp could get hurt.\u00a0[1]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cale had no idea where he had gotten such a thing.\u201cIs it you?\u201dToonka licked his lips before approaching the Humpback Whale. Even the close to 2m tall Toonka looked tiny in front of the Whale.\u201cHehe, this is my first time fighting a whale.\u201dToonka didn\u2019t seem to know that this Whale was a Beast person. He just wanted to fight it because it seemed to be strong. All that filled his head was strength and fighting.That was why the Humpback Whale looked down at Toonka with disdain.Cale just continued to crouch in a corner as he watched them.- What are you doing?The Black Dragon\u2019s extremely curious question rang inside Cale\u2019s head, but Cale had moved back to a safe distance before crouching down.\u2018A shrimp gets hurt when whales fight.\u2019Cale, who was weaker than a shrimp, did not want to get hurt by their fight.\u201cCan you just beat a whale to death?\u201dToonka\u2019s eyes started to sparkle. He then lightly kicked the ground with his foot. Once he did that, his body instantly shot up into the air.\u201cWow.\u201dCale watched in admiration before stepping even further back.Toonka\u2019s bat started to swing toward the Humpback Whale. It was then that Cale could see how a Whale sneers. One corner of the Humpback Whale\u2019s lips went up as the Whale started to move.The 15m long large body instantly twisted before the large tail smacked down toward Toonka. However, Toonka managed to change direction in the air before safely landing back down.Boom!The boulder that Toonka jumped up from was destroyed by the Whale\u2019s tail.Splaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash-A large wave was created from the Whale\u2019s attack, and it drenched Cale, along with the rest of the shoreline.\u2018Damn it. I look like a rat that is drenched by rain.\u2019However, Cale kept his mouth shut. The impact of the destroyed boulder and the crazed Toonka were too great.\u201cMuhahahaha. Great, just great! Come on!\u201dToonka was jumping up and down for the Whale to attack again. Toonka rushed quickly toward the Whale\u2019s tail and swung his bat down once again. Instead of avoiding the attack, the Whale just raised its tail to attack Toonka.Boom!It was not a noise that would be made when a human made contact with a Whale.Boom.With a large noise, Toonka came back down to the ground. The bat in his hands had disintegrated into dust.\u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have used something like a bat. Fighting is best when you use your fists! Hahahha!\u201dCale started to think as he watched this lunatic continue to fight.\u2018Everybody is going to come here at this rate.\u2019Cale thought that people probably already knew something was going on. What could he do about it? What could he do to slip away quietly? Cale didn\u2019t care whether the two of them fought or not.It was at that moment.\u201cNoona! If you keep fighting, that generous man will get hurt!\u201dThe tiny Whale finally arrived at the island.Toonka instantly flinched.\u201c...That puny whale is talking?\u201dThat comment made the Humpback Whale start to frown and glare at Toonka. A beautiful voice then followed it.\u201cYou called my little brother puny?\u201dToonka became even more shocked as he shouted.\u201cThis one can talk as well?\u201dIt was a total mess. Cale could see Toonka\u2019s shoulders moving up and down in excitement.\u201cOho, you must be Beast people! Beast people! This is going to be fun!\u201dToonka was no longer laughing out loud. However, the smile on his face showed that he was at the maximum level of excitement.At that moment, Cale could see that the Humpback Whale glanced over in his direction. He then saw that the Whale\u2019s eyes started to shake.Cale, the human who was crouching on the ground covered in seawater and boulder dust while looking up at Witira, the Humpback Whale Beast person.Her heart started to shake as the guardian of the ocean who protects weak creatures.Paseton jumped in between the two of them and started to speak.\u201cNoona, I am still alive.\u201d\u201cPaseton.\u201dThe Humpback Whale started to scrunch her face. Her eyes started to tear up.Paseton looked toward Toonka before quickly moving his fin out of the water and pointing it toward Cale.Splash. Splash.The water splashed along with Paseton\u2019s movement, and the water droplets hit Cale\u2019s face.\u201cThis sir is the person who saved me when I was dying from the mermaid\u2019s poison.\u201dThe large Humpback Whale\u2019s pupils shook. The small Whale got as close to the island as possible and checked on Cale.\u201cOh no, you are completely drenched. I\u2019m also sorry about all these boulder dust. I was going to visit you tonight to thank you.\u201dCale brushed the boulder dust off and responded.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Are you better now?\u201d\u201cYes sir. I am almost fully recovered now thanks to you.\u201dThe anxious Humpback Whale\u2019s mouth dropped a bit. It was at that moment.\u201cYou can\u2019t get distracted when you are fighting against me! Do you want to die?!\u201dToonka jumped up toward the Humpback Whale Beast person, Witira, and swung his fist. However, his fist could not touch the Humpback Whale. It was because the Whale disappeared.Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.Water vapor filled the area where the Humpback Whale used to be. A woman stepped onto the island from inside the water vapor.Tap. Tap.The woman who stepped forward with her heels clicking was Witira in her human form.\u201cNoona!\u201dPaseton called out to Witira.Cale was a bit surprised at that moment.\u2018This is not just at the level of making elves look like squids!\u2019WItira was what you would call an explosive beauty. She was so extremely beautiful that she would make even elves look like cockroaches. It was to the point that Cale wondered how someone could be so beautiful.Blue hair and blue eyes. If there was a contest for the most beautiful existence in the ocean, it would probably be the person in front of Cale\u2019s eyes right now.The Black Dragon started to speak into Cale\u2019s head at that moment.- \u2026 Dragons are even cooler. When a dragon becomes a human, I\u2019m sure they are even more handsome and more beautiful. The human form of dragons is probably the best in the world.Cale completely ignored the Black Dragon and stepped backward. Forget beautiful and handsome, the humanized Whale Beast people were still just as strong and violent. Witira started to speak as Cale was starting to worry.\u201c...Please do not run away. I will not hurt you.\u201d\u201cMy sister is someone who keeps her word.\u201dPaseton soon transformed and approached Cale as well. Witira could see that Paseton\u2019s pants were ripped around his calves, and she could see the scars underneath. Anger filled her eyes once again.Toonka slowly walked over as well.\u201cStop paying attention to such a useless person. Hurry up and fight me. That\u2019s more fun!\u201dCale and Toonka made eye contact at that moment. Toonka started to scoff at Cale.\u201cLooks like this punk just goes around saving people.\u201dTsk. Cale clicked his tongue at the term, \u2018punk.\u2019 Toonka seems to have thrown away the stupid alias of, \u2018Bob,\u2019 at this point. This was the real Toonka. Regardless of whether the opponent was a noble or a strong person, he just acted as he pleased.Cale was more used to this version of Toonka. It was because it seemed like the character in the novel had come to life. Of course, Cale still had no intentions of letting this just pass by.\u2018He\u2019ll only learn after regretting the sale of the Magic Tower to me in the future.\u2019Cale was confident because he knew about what would soon happen, no, what Cale would personally make happen in the future.The alias of Bob. This was actually a great name for an alias. It was because he would be rice for Cale to take in the future. [1]However, the Black Dragon started to speak into Cale\u2019s mind in anger.- To rescue someone or to save someone is a glorious deed! It is something to be proud about. And talking bad about someone is mean. This punk is as bad as Venion!...How did the Black Dragon end up like this when dragons were supposed to be creatures that only care about themselves? Cale started to think about what could have made the Black Dragon change from the normal attitude of a dragon. He then slowly moved his body behind Witira. He was a bit afraid that Toonka might kill him for being an annoying and weak person.\u201c...Do not look down on such heroic action.\u201dHowever, Witira seemed to be angry. Cale also moved away from Witira after hearing what she had to say. Witira noticed Cale\u2019s actions and calmly started to speak.\u201cThank you very much. I will properly thank you in the future.\u201dHowever, anger was still burning in her eyes. This was the woman who was at the vanguard in the fight against the mermaids. She was not the type to avoid a battle nor even a small provocation.\u201cOh, I like the look in your eyes. Are you finally ready to fight?\u201dToonka started to twitch and lick his lips. He then relaxed his arms and moved his weight toward his front foot. This was Toonka\u2019s battle position.Witira started to smile.\u201cYou think I would battle with someone like you?\u201dThat was a mocking smile.She then created a ball of light that seemed to be quite powerful.Witira opened her right hand.Splaaaaaash.Pillars of water shot up into her palm and a long water whip appeared into her hands. She flicked her whip toward the ocean.This whip, that seemed to be at least a couple of meters in length, cut through the water and caused the water to riot. Witira stared at Toonka with a chilly gaze as she started to speak.\u201cFunny. This is not a battle.\u201dShe flicked her finger at Toonka as she continued.\u201cThis is a lesson.\u201d\u201cYou are going to teach me? Hahaha!\u201dToonka let out a loud laughter that seemed strong enough to cause an earthquake and looked toward WItira with an emotionless face.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll need to rip that mouth of yours off.\u201dHe then immediately rushed toward Witira. Once Toonka started to rush toward her, Witira waved her left hand toward Cale. A water shield surrounded Cale and Paseton in order to protect them.Flick!At the same time, the whip in her right hand viciously shot out toward Toonka.Boom!Toonka\u2019s fist made contact with the whip. Witira started to smile.\u201cAt least it\u2019ll be fun to teach you a lesson.\u201d\u201cUgh, this is nothing!\u201dWitira moved her whip to wrap around Toonka\u2019s body like a snake and lifted him up into the air. Toonka started to smile as he grabbed onto the water whip with his hands.\u201cMuahaha, a battle of strength is my specialty!\u201dToonka broke apart the snake-like whip with his hands. This caused Witira to raise an eyebrow. However, Toonka was still no match for this future Queen of the Whales.Witira lightly flicked her right hand and the whip quickly attacked Toonka\u2019s body.The impact made Toonka fly toward the forest.At that moment.\u201c...What is going on?\u201dAmiru Ubarr, the investigation squad, and the knights appeared in the forest. Toonka was flying toward them.Witira\u2019s eyes grew wide as she urgently shot out a strand of water with her left hand. However, Toonka was moving too fast.\u201cEverybody, open up your shields!\u201dAmiru determined that it would be impossible to dodge, and immediately ordered the knights to defend. The knights quickly opened up their shields. Toonka saw what they were doing and shouted toward them.\u201cDefend properly! My body is very strong, so you may get hurt! Muhahahaha!\u201dIt seemed probable that the knights would get hurt from this collision because they were wearing leather armor. The mixed-blood Whale Beast person Paseton was watching all of this when he heard a sigh coming from behind him.\u201cSigh, so annoying.\u201dThe voice seemed to be both annoyed and calm at the same time. Paseton\u2019s eyes opened wide as he turned toward the voice.Boom!Toonka crashed into the shields. However, Toonka did not crash into anybody and nobody got hurt. Toonka turned around to see that a holy-looking silver shield had made contact with his back. There were also song wings that gently surrounded him.\u201c...What the...\u201dThe shield slowly turned transparent before disappearing. Witira\u2019s strand of water that was coming to create a shield disappeared into the air. She turned around with shock.The disappearing silver shield was connected to that man who had his head down as he let out another sigh.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale looked calm as he brushed back his drenched hair. However, he was frowning with frustration.Instead of a shrimp getting hurt in a fight between whales, the shrimp had to use its powers during the fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thankfully, the knights did not get hurt, but he had just ended up unintentionally saving Toonka.Cale seemed calm as he stood up, but his legs were numb from crouching for too long.\u201cAh.\u201dCale frowned as he stood up. He stumbled because his left leg was numb.\u201cYoung master Cale!\u201dAmiru rushed over with a shocked expression. Paseton, who was also shocked, grabbed onto Cale\u2019s arm. However, Cale pushed Paseton away and stood up straight. Amiru had an urgent expression as she rushed over to Cale.\u201cYoung master Cale! You didn\u2019t need to use your strength! Why did you do it?\u201dWhy? It wasn\u2019t like Cale wanted to do it.But it would make things complicated if the investigation squad was injured. Thanks to Cale, it was just a small issue, but if Toonka had hurt the knights of the territory, things would get much bigger. Cale could not let that happen because Toonka had to return to the Whipper Kingdom at the right time.\u2018Otherwise, I would lose out.\u2019Amiru inspected Cale with concern and disappointment.\u201cAnd why are you completely drenched like this? Are you okay? You are in recovery right now, what will you do if you catch a cold?! Young master Cale! You really!\u201dAmiru\u2019s words made Paseton and Witira flinch. This was especially true for Witira, who bit down on her lips and inspected Cale as well. She recalled how her tail had drenched Cale earlier, and thought about the expression on his face when he had looked up while crouching earlier.At that moment, Cale started to speak to the three of them. His voice was slow and seemed to be very tired.\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine since nobody got hurt?\u201dHis voice lacked any warmth, as if he was frustrated. He definitely was frustrated. His drenched clothes did not feel comfortable, and he wanted to get away from these troublemakers and get some rest now.Paseton lowered his head while Witira looked around. She could see the shoreline that she had destroyed just a few moments ago, and bit down on her lips once again. Amiru hesitated for a moment before starting to speak.\u201c...Young master Cale, it is really difficult to understand you. Very difficult.\u201dCale just shut up after seeing that a similar situation to the plaza incident was about to happen again. Everything was annoying.Amiru turned away from Cale and looked toward the two Whale Tribe members. Her gaze toward them was calm, yet angry.\u201cAnd who are you?\u201dThis was part of the Roan Kingdom, but this was her family\u2019s territory. Amiru had no intentions of letting such an incident that happened in the Ubarr territory go.\u201cAnd Bob.\u201dAmiru glared sharply at Toonka, who was blankly standing off to the side.\u201cWho are you?\u201dNone of the three answered Amiru\u2019s question. Toonka seemed to be worried about something, while Paseton was thinking about what to say. As for Witira, she could only lower her head after seeing what she had done.At that moment, Amiru heard a noise.\u201cAchoo!\u201dCale\u2019s nose was itchy and made him sneeze. He pushed back the hair that fell on his face before looking up. He didn\u2019t care about anything in front of his eyes and ignored all of the gazes that were focused on him before speaking normally.\u201cLet\u2019s go back first.\u201dNobody could say no to him.***Cale explained the entire situation before coming out of Amiru\u2019s residence and looking at the three people behind him. Witira, Paseton, and Toonka. He then made eye contact with Amiru, who was coming out behind them.She took a look at Cale before sternly speaking to Toonka.\u201cYou must leave by tomorrow. You should be thankful that all you are getting for punishment is being banished from our territory.\u201dAmiru had demanded that Toonka leave her territory by tomorrow. It was because it became blatantly obvious that he was not a fisherman, as well as because he was the cause of the battle.\u201cThe two of you will receive similar punishment if you cause any more issues within my territory.\u201dThe Whale siblings bowed toward Amiru with calm expressions. Cale observed the two siblings who were hiding that they were related to the Whale King, before turning his head.\u201cYoung master Cale, you seem to be catching a cold, so please head on inside.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dAmiru\u2019s gaze became sharp as she turned back to look at Toonka.\u201cYou return our generosity with such actions.\u201dCale gently started to speak.\u201cThat is why you are banishing him.\u201dToonka\u2019s banishment. That was what Cale had told Amiru to do.\u201cYoung master Cale, you really\u2026\u201dAmiru had heard from Paseton about how Cale had saved his life, as well as how Cale had no fault, but ended up getting dragged into the mess.\u201cYoung lady Amiru, it was not much.\u201dCale had a gentle expression on his face.- Didn\u2019t you ask me if I could defeat Toonka?As usual, Cale just ignored the Black Dragon.After telling Amiru multiple times that he was okay, Cale turned his gaze toward Toonka. Toonka had been staring at Cale as well. Toonka had a blank expression for a while now, no, it was more of a complicated expression.Ancient power.It was the only type of power that the non-mages, who focused on physical strength, accepted as strength. It was because they considered it a blessing for someone\u2019s power to be passed down through generations.Cale was looking at Toonka with no specific emotion.He was a crazy bastard who ended up becoming a hero, but also showed signs of self-destruction in volume 5.The Whales approached Cale, and Witira cautiously asked.\u201cIs it really okay for us to go with you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you have somewhere to go. I can give you a place to stay for a night.\u201dCale got on the carriage and ordered the Whale siblings to follow. He then closed the carriage door and started to think.At least Toonka will be going back to the Whipper Kingdom.Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo\u2019s style was to not create a deep relationship with someone he could not communicate with. This was different than avoiding someone because things could get complicated.\u2018Do I need to contact the crown prince?\u2019How would the crown prince react if Cale said they should bring back the honey-filled hive left in the Whipper Kingdom? He could anticipate the crown prince\u2019s response because they were similar people.The crown prince would be very happy.Cale was dreaming of bringing that hive back and living a nice relaxing life in the future.Cale had to greet deputy butler Hans, Beacrox, the Vice Captain, the ten Wolf children, On, and Hong once he got back.Hans had originally approached Cale normally before dropping his jaws after seeing the Whale siblings. He then quickly caught himself and started to approach Cale again.\u201cYoung master-nim, are you okay? I heard about what happened.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. Oh, and show these two people to a room.\u201dCale pushed the two Whale siblings to Hans before turning to look at Beacrox. Beacrox, who was dressed flawlessly, as usual, started to frown once he took a look at Cale. Seeing Cale looking like a mess with the boulder dust and dried sea water, Beacrox turned toward Maes and started to speak.\u201cHeat up the water.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dMaes calmly responded before approaching Cale.\u201cYoung master-nim, I heard you were dragged into their battle and almost got hurt.\u201dCale looked toward Maes, as well as the other Wolf children who were watching him, and casually answered.\u201cNot at all. There was no chance that I would get hurt.\u201d\u201c... I understand.\u201dThe extremely bright and pure Wolf children were calm, unlike their usual selves. Cale just brushed it aside and continued to watch the children, who quickly rushed away to heat up the bath water, before looking back at Beacrox. Beacrox started to speak as soon as they made eye contact.\u201cYoung master-nim, please wash up first.\u201dCale could see that Beacrox could not stand Cale\u2019s dirtiness, and so he just nodded his head. He tried to head to the bath but a voice called out to him.\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dIt was Paseton and Witira. Paseton was the one who called for him, but Witira was the first to speak.\u201cMay we visit you after you have rested for a bit?\u201dThe Whale King. As they were his children, these two were pretty much of the same rank as the kingdom\u2019s royalty. However, the two of them were hiding the fact that they were related to the Whale King. Honestly speaking, there was no reason to hide it. It wasn\u2019t like the humans would know that they were royalty. It was rare to find a person who even knew about the existence of Whale people.\u201cCome tomorrow.\u201dCale answered curtly before turning around. He could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice in his head. The Black Dragon had a lot to say since earlier.- You sneezed! Will you be able to move tonight? Shouldn\u2019t you get some rest? Why are you so weak that I have to worry so much?! Human! It is so frustrating!\u2018I\u2019m the one who is frustrated.\u2019Cale decided to use the fact that nobody believed that he was completely healthy to his advantage. He told everyone not to come to him tonight because he needed rest, before speaking to the Black Dragon.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c...I\u2019ll listen for now.\u201dOn and Hong sent them off as Cale headed to the Ubarr islands with the Black Dragon.Today was the day he needed to extend these whirlpools\u2019 lifespans to last for another year.- I do not know why you are doing this when you are not well. This intelligent dragon brain of mine cannot understand.Cale casually responded to the grumblings of a 4-year-old.\u201cIt has to be done today.\u201dThe territory\u2019s mages would arrive tomorrow, making it more difficult to move. He had to take care of that puddle water and the whirlpool today.Cale could see that there were still lights on the central island and landed on an island farther away. This was the location of the second strongest whirlpool, well, now the strongest whirlpool.\u201cSigh.\u201dHe then let out a sigh.- Why is that punk swimming over here? Wait, why is that punk even here? I do not understand.Cale could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s anxious voice. There was nobody on the island that Cale and the Black Dragon landed on. However, there was someone in the whirlpool in front of the island.It was such a turbulent whirlpool that it was impossible to see the person inside while up in the air.\u201cHe must really be a lunatic.\u201dIt was a dark night, as the moon had just finished its cycle. Cale started to think after seeing Toonka, who had jumped into the whirlpool on such a night. Cale wanted to know just what that crazy bastard was thinking.At that moment, Toonka jumped out of the whirlpool and rushed over to the island.\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201dToonka kept his gaze on Cale as he approached closer.\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t just an average person. I knew I smelled a strong person nearby. Are you a mage? How did you fly across the sky?\u201dToonka\u2019s eyes started to shake after saying the word mage. His plan was to fight Cale if he said that he was a mage, and kill Cale if he was weak. Toonka was someone who thought that mages were a poison to the world. He continued to quickly walk toward Cale.\u201cAre you ignoring me because you are a fancy pants mage? Hmm?\u201dToonka could see Cale letting out a sigh. Cale looked toward him before casually answering.\u201cI am thinking.\u201dCale was thinking about how to deal with this stupid fool.\u2018Do I put him in place or put him to use?\u2019That was what Cale was thinking about. Cale observed Toonka, who seemed to want to rush over and attack him.\u201cWhat are you thinking about that you are ignoring me?\u201dCale finished thinking the moment Toonka said those final words. He then immediately acted.\u2018Let\u2019s do both.\u2019Boom!\u201cUgh!\u201dToonka, who was not prepared, got blown away and landed in the water. A whirlpool was surrounding Toonka\u2019s body.\u201cWhat is going on?!\u201dToonka, who had a high magic resistance, found it difficult to deal with this wind. The endlessly swirling wind and water from the sea sucked Toonka in like a swamp.Cale created whirlpools in both of his hands as he approached Toonka.Splash. Splash.The sound of Cale stepping into the water could be heard.He then looked down at Toonka, who was sucked into the sea by the sudden attack. No matter how tall someone was, there would always be a chance to look down at them.\u201cMages cannot have ancient powers.\u201dToonka could feel the wind around him disappear as he looked up at Cale.\u201cBob, a warrior like you should understand what I mean, right?\u201dA power that was passed down from a human who created that power.Toonka had heard about ancient powers, but this was his first time seeing one in action. He remained silent for a while before finally starting to speak.\u201c...Then you are not a mage?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dToonka asked another question after hearing Cale\u2019s stern, yet very clear response.\u201cThen how do you know about the non-mage faction?\u201dToonka found this noble in front of him to be weirder the more he ran into him.\u2018Yes. He\u2019s a weird one.\u2019This noble did not care that he was not using formal language with him. He was also someone who worked hard to save others when he was ill. This was also the weirdo who had a scent of a strong person around him, even though he himself was not strong.Someone who continued to reveal unique powers every time he saw him. He was also someone who tried to save him.This was Toonka\u2019s first time seeing such a person.However, Cale\u2019s continued words shocked Toonka once more.Cale did not answer Toonka\u2019s question. Instead, he asked a question of his own.\u201cDo you have any thoughts about destroying the Magic Tower?\u201d\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201dToonka\u2019s eyes opened widely in shock. His expression seemed to be asking how Cale knew about it.Destroying the Magic Tower. That was one of the goals of the non-mage faction from the beginning. Cale continued to speak.\u201cIf you plan to do so, please do not destroy it too much.\u201dToonka subconsciously let out his thoughts.\u201c...Crazy bastard, what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAh, but please kick out all of the mages.\u201dToonka could finally make a determination about Cale after hearing what Cale had to say. Cale started to smile while looking at Toonka.The non-mages who win the Civil War lead the Whipper Kingdom to grow before it quickly breaks down. Although natural instincts took down the rationality known as magic, an existence without rationality would be no better than an animal.Cale\u2019s plan was to take control of the benefits that those animals will end up missing.\u201cI plan to purchase that Magic Tower. What do you think?\u201dToonka started to smile as he looked up at Cale.\u201cWhat a crazy bastard.\u201dToonka had made up his mind about Cale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: Currently Thinking (5)Cale responded to Toonka\u2019s words by pointing at Toonka and starting to speak.\u201cAre you and your crew not also crazy for trying to flip everything over?\u201dToonka\u2019s smile ended up turning into laughter.\u201cHahahaha-\u201dIt was so loud that it echoed around the islands. Toonka finally stopped laughing after a while and started to shake his head as he responded to Cale.\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201dToonka\u2019s gaze was cold as he stopped laughing and glared at Cale.\u201cWe are not crazy at all.\u201dCale knew that Toonka would respond like that. Toonka was certain that the non-mages were the right choice for the future of the Whipper Kingdom. He was going to prove it with results.\u201cOf course. I am the same.\u201dToonka slowly observed Cale, who was saying that he was also not crazy. After observing Cale for a while, he finally started to speak.\u201cPersonally come to buy it.\u201dToonka did not say that he could not destroy the Magic Tower or that he had no plans on destroying it.\u201cThat was always the plan.\u201dCale did not think that Toonka\u2019s subordinates would say anything about Toonka making the decision on his own for Cale to come to purchase the Magic Tower.The Whipper Kingdom was the greatest source of magic devices in the Western Continent. That meant that it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that the kingdom\u2019s money came from the mages and the magic devices.Money would be the biggest issue once the non-mage faction won the civil war. Furthermore, they desired to get rid of any and all traces of magic in the Whipper Kingdom.Cale was aiming for that moment.\u2018The crown prince will like it for a different reason though.\u2019The Magic Tower that Toonka and crew would think had nothing left inside would actually hold the treasure that the non-mages were dying to obtain.\u201cBut how did you know that I was part of the non-mage faction?\u201dSigh.Cale let out another long sigh at Toonka\u2019s question. That made Toonka flinch, and Cale did not miss that moment to answer.\u201cYou are someone from the Whipper Kingdom that is currently on the brink of a civil war. You then looked like you would kill me if I said I was a mage. Who wouldn\u2019t think of the non-mage faction?\u201d\u201c...I guess?\u201dCale just turned away from Toonka after hearing his response. Cale was thinking about how Toonka could be so stupid in general yet so sharp and naturally intelligent in battle.However, Toonka seemed to have become even more interested, as he approached Cale.\u201cWhy are you coming here?\u201dToonka did not stop at Cale\u2019s blunt question.\u201cSeems like you\u2019re about to do something fun. I want to watch.\u201dHe really had stupidly great instincts. Cale waved his hand.\u201cJust go over there and play with the whirlpool. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cAre you really a noble?\u201dToonka continued to be amazed to Cale. Toonka thought that the noble named Amiru was quite relaxed for a noble, but it was nothing compared to this punk in front of him right now. Talking so informally to a noble would usually lead to a lot of trouble, but Toonka could not help but speak informally to the noble in front of him.\u201cI am indeed a noble. Just like you are a warrior.\u201dCale casually responded and looked around. There was a lot that he needed to do today. At the same time, he heard Toonka\u2019s voice coming from behind him.\u201cInteresting.\u201dCale just frowned and pretended to not hear Toonka. He then released his silver shield. The silver wings appeared alongside the shield and lightly fluttered. At that moment, the Black Dragon\u2019s voice rang in Cale\u2019s head.- I am very sharp.Cale\u2019s body started to float. The Black Dragon had used its magic right on cue. Cale decided to take care of the other whirlpools first.\u201cBob.\u201dCale called out Toonka\u2019s alias. Bob was still Toonka\u2019s official name for everyone right now.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou know all this is a secret, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. I prefer to keep all the fun things to myself.\u201dThe smirking Toonka really seemed to be crazy. His physique, hair, and smile all made him look even scarier because it was dark. Cale floated up into the air and started to speak.\u201cI will find a ship and crew for you. Don\u2019t you need to quickly return home?\u201d\u201cOh? Thanks.\u201dCale waved his hand toward the confused Toonka and headed up into the clouds.\u201cWin. You can do it.\u201dThat was the only way for Cale to benefit from it.Cale turned toward an island with another whirlpool. At that moment, he could hear Toonka\u2019s loud laughter. It was louder than ever before.\u201cHahahaha!\u201d\u2018Was that bastard always so full of laughter?\u2019Cale wondered as he headed to another island. Toonka watched Cale fly away for awhile before thinking that the whirlpools were no longer fun, and returning to his residence. However, Cale had no way to know about what Toonka didInstead, he started to speak to the Black Dragon.\u201cDo you know when I am the angriest?\u201d- When?The Black Dragon could see a relaxed smile on Cale\u2019s face.\u201cWhen I throw something away for cheap because I think it is trash, yet it ends up being gold. Especially when I really need that gold.\u201dThe corner of the Black Dragon\u2019s lips started to twitch.- I learned something good.\u201cNo. There\u2019s more.\u201d- More?\u201cYes.\u201dCale leisurely continued.\u201cIt is even worse when I need to pay even more than it's worth to buy that gold back.\u201d- ...That would suck.Cale responded with a villainous smile and started to take care of what he needed to do. He landed on the next island.\u201cThere is no one here.\u201dCale put both palms down on the ground once the Black Dragon confirmed that no one was here.Boom.Cale could feel his heart beating wildly.\u2018The Vitality of the Heart really did strengthen the Sound of the Wind.\u2019Cale could feel the strength of the wind rushing up from his feet to his palms.It took less than one second for that to happen.Swiiiiiiiish.The winds were roaring in both of Cale\u2019s palms. Cale then combined the two whirlwinds into one.Sizzle.The two whirlwinds combined with a sizzling noise and started to generate heat. However, because they shared the same master, they eventually became one and became a much bigger whirlwind orb. Cale then floated that orb up into the air.Boom!He then slammed down on the orb with the Indestructible Shield. The wind orb shot down into the whirlpool underneath the water.Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish-The wind orb and the wind top inside the whirlpool started to mix together.Cale looked away from the whirlpool as he floated back up with the Black Dragon\u2019s magic. The top would now last at least six months. Cale would be able to feel it if it disappeared in less than a year, and would determine what to do at that point.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the next island.\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s wings fluttered as he increased his speed. Cale continued to throw wind orbs into the whirlpools before moving to gather up the fateful encounter puddle water.The next day, Cale was at the port early in the morning.\u201cBob.\u201dHe introduced Toonka to the ship and the crew. Toonka stared at them for a while before starting to speak.\u201cCome after two months. The world will be different.\u201dCale started to think that he must absolutely not go to the Whipper Kingdom in the next two months. He could see the excitement in Toonka\u2019s eyes and knew that he was going to run wild.\u201c...Hurry back home.\u201dCale slowly moved away from Toonka and looked toward to crew to urge them to leave. Toonka watched Cale and hesitated for a bit before finally deciding to ask.\u201cAre you weak?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dToonka seemed extremely confused after hearing Cale\u2019s sharp and clear answer. However, he then stepped onto the ship.\u201cMake sure you come after two months.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dCale casually waved at Toonka and then turned away from the ship. At that moment, Toonka shouted loudly from behind Cale.\u201cMy name is Toonka! Don\u2019t forget it!\u201dCale turned back around. The mid-sized ship was leaving the port with the sun shining down on it brightly while Toonka was waving at him from the deck.It felt like a scene out of an anime when the main character was leaving. Cale thought he saw something he shouldn\u2019t have seen and turned back around without any regrets. Cale continued to hear Toonka shout for Cale to not forget his name, but Cale made sure not to turn back.But he was feeling full just thinking about what would happen two months later. He would be able to earn enough money to spend for a lifetime and get a way to build a strong castle as well.Cale returned to the residence to greet the others. He started to pet the kittens, On and Hong, who had been hiding inside the residence since they got here, as he started to speak.\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to come to see me.\u201d\u201cI needed to come to thank you as well as to apologize for scaring you.\u201dOn and Hong dropped their jaws as they blankly stared at Witira. These kittens, who did not even have much reaction when they saw Paseton, had a completely different reaction to Witira.Witira checked Cale\u2019s expression as she cautiously asked.\u201cAre you feeling okay, young master Cale?\u201d\u201cEh, same as usual.\u201dCale was always at 100 percent thanks to the Vitality of the Heart. It allowed him to feel perfectly fine, even after sleeping for only one or two hoursHe then started to speak to Witira, who had suddenly stopped talking, as well as her younger brother Paseton next to her.\u201cThat\u2019s enough thanks. If you thank me anymore, it will not feel genuine. Same thing with the apology.\u201d\u201cGot it. Thank you very much.\u201d [1]Cale blankly stared at Witira, who was speaking formally to him, but observed her at the same time. The bloodline of the Whale King. This was different from the chief of any other Beast tribe, because the Whale King was the person who ruled half of the ocean. That made the Whale King no less than the king of a kingdom.However, Witira was speaking formally and respectfully to Cale. She had not done so to Choi Han in the novel.\u2018Why is she hiding her identity, even though she revealed the fact that she is part of the Whale tribe?\u2019However, Cale did not reveal the question on his mind out loud. Cale was trying to hide the fact that he knew quite a bit about the Whale Tribe.\u201cYou just thanked me again. I said no more.\u201dCale continued to speak to the two siblings who seemed to be straight out of a piece of art.\u201cI\u2019m glad you siblings got to meet back up. You can go now.\u201dHe had sent Toonka back already and wanted to meet with the Ubarr territory\u2019s head before heading back to the Henituse territory. Of course, there was stuff for him to complete back home, but he would at least be able to rest until he went up to the Whipper Kingdom.It was at that moment.\u201cExcuse me, young master Cale-nim.\u201dWitira\u2019s voice, and the voice of the Whale tribe in general, was as beautiful as the legendary siren, the dangerous beings that lured people to jump into the sea with their beautiful voice.Cale started to get the chills thinking about that legendary existence. He slowly turned his head to look at Witira. He had an odd feeling in his mind as he did so.\u201cWe have a very old enemy. I\u2019m sure you already know because you healed Paseton. It is the mermaids.\u201d\u2018I know. I know very well.\u2019\u201cHowever, my brother Paseton was able to figure out how they were able to suddenly get stronger.\u201d\u2018What the hell is she talking about?\u2019Cale started to frown as Paseton added on.\u201cThe reason the mermaids were chasing after me was because I found the source of their sudden increase in strength.\u201dThe mixed-blood Whale Paseton who was killed while being chased by the mermaids. There was a reason he was being chased, and the information he had was very important for the war between the mermaids and the Whales.\u201cI heard that young master is from the Henituse family.\u201d\u201c...And?\u201dWitira and Paseton did not respond right away and exchanged glances with each other. That action made Cale even iffier. Witira finally turned toward Cale and started to speak.\u201cThe Forest of Darkness. I wish to go there. No, I must go there.\u201dCale subconsciously answered after hearing something he had never expected to hear.\u201cOur territory?\u201dThe Forest of Darkness. That was the place that Choi Han had lived for tens of years, as well as one of the Western Continent\u2019s five most dangerous and mysterious locations.It was also the place that the Henituse family had kept under control for the kingdom for a very long time.\u201cI beg you. We have prepared a large compensation for you as well. May we please go with you?\u201dThe large and small Whales both looked at him with sincerity. On and Hong tapped Cale\u2019s knee with their front paws. It was their way of asking Cale to take the Whales with them. At the same time, there was a knock on the door before it opened. It was the Wolf child, Maes.\u201cYoung master-nim, here is your tea and snack.\u201dTwo other Wolf children came in with a tray and teapot. Beacrox was outside the door guiding them.- I am much more handsome and beautiful.Cale heard the Black Dragon\u2019s mumbling before closing his eyes. He felt like he was standing in the middle of a chaotic whirlpool.\u201cUmm, young master-nim?\u201dCale raised his hand at Witira\u2019s cautious question, which made Witira stop talking. Once the Wolf children left and the room became quiet once again, Cale slowly opened his eyes back.He looked very calm with his back to the couch, as he sat there with his messy yet cool looking red hair. However, in comparison, Cale\u2019s dark brown pupils looked so deep that you could not see the end.Witira and Paseton were looking into Cale\u2019s eyes when they heard his calm voice.\u201cFirst, explain everything to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We control the north and the mermaids control the south.\u201dPaseton looked toward Cale. Cale, who was leaning on the couch, motioned to Paseton with his chin to continue with his story. On and Hong peeked at Cale\u2019s face before slowly moving away from Cale\u2019s knee and heading toward the corner of the room next to the Black Dragon.\u201cWe are fighting to prevent the mermaids from creating a kingdom throughout the entire ocean. However, something changed six months ago.\u201dPaseton\u2019s eyes started to fall.\u201cThe mermaids started acting weird.\u201d\u2018Weird?\u2019Cale started to think about the novel\u2019s information regarding the mermaids.\u201cThey crossed over the implicit border between our two tribes and started to provoke us.\u201dThis was something Cale knew about. The mermaids start to provoke the Whales so that they could take control of the ocean. Cale started to feel relieved after hearing information he already knew about. Paseton continued to speak.\u201cI was able to figure out the reason behind it.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m sure it is because they want to create their kingdom.\u2019The Whale tribe in volumes 4 and 5 knew about the mermaid\u2019s plan, and that was why Choi Han was helping them fight against the mermaids.\u201cThey are trying to take control of the sea route that connects the Eastern and Western continents.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCale sat up straight and looked toward Paseton before asking.\u201cIsn\u2019t the sea route something for the humans?\u201dThere were a couple different sea routes that connect the Western and Eastern continents. The humans had found these routes, but they were far and dangerous, preventing an official route from becoming created.According to the novel, there was an implicit agreement between the lifeforms living in the water and the lifeforms living above water. The sea lifeforms would not touch these sea routes and the land lifeforms would not meddle in the issues of the sea in exchange. That was why Choi Han was troubled on whether to involve himself in the battles between the Whales and the mermaids.But the mermaids were going to break this agreement?Witira started to speak.\u201cAt first, we thought that the new king of the mermaids was leading the charge to create their kingdom, but the information Paseton brought back was different.\u201dSigh.Cale let out a sigh and took a sip of his now lukewarm tea.\u2018I learned something I shouldn\u2019t have learned again.\u2019The problem was that it was an even bigger issue than all of the other information he had learned up until now. It was even bigger than the issue with the crown prince Alberu.\u201cAnd there was one more weird thing.\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201dCale prevented Witira from continuing by interrupting her.\u201cJust tell me why the Forest of Darkness is involved.\u201dCale felt like he would become involved in something big if he heard anything else. He was starting to feel uncomfortable. Cale could see Witira slightly smiling.Why did the smile of this beautiful Whale look so scary to Cale?\u201cYes. This is regarding that!\u201dWitira brightly answered while Cale\u2019s expression turned darker.\u201cAs we mentioned, the mermaids became stronger about one or two months ago. We were able to figure out the, \u2018ingredient,\u2019 that caused this to happen.\u201dCale closed his eyes. He slowly opened them back and asked the two Whales.\u201cThat ingredient is in the Forest of Darkness?\u201d\u201cCorrect! You realized it right away!\u201d\u2018What the hell was going on? How could something from land in the Forest of Darkness make a sea lifeform stronger?\u2019Cale was shocked.More importantly, how did the mermaids reach the Forest of Darkness? Cale had an iffy feeling about this.Paseton\u2019s eyes were sparkling as he decisively continued.\u201cI heard them talking about a swamp in the Forest of Darkness. That was why I was chased by them. We need to go to the swamp and figure out what the ingredient is.\u201dCale did not need to hear anything else.The Forest of Darkness.Choi Han\u2019s Harris Village.Cale thought about the ten Wolf children, who were probably outside the door right now, before turning to look at the corner of the room. On and Hong were there with an odd gap between the two of them. The invisible Black Dragon was probably between them.- Human, what are you looking at?\u2018I was thinking about building him a villa.\u2019- Is it because you think I am the coolest? Fine, I will give you permission to keep looking at me.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe Whale siblings\u2019 pupils grew larger. However, Cale did not look at them as he started to think.\u2018What would be the benefit?\u2019In order to figure out what the benefits would be, there was something he needed to understand first.\u201cHumans cannot interfere in the events of the sea.\u201dWitira immediately responded.\u201cWe know that is the case. However, we plan on making sure you are not at a disadvantage in any way from this. Everything will be done by us in secret.\u201dShe then added on to respond to Cale\u2019s statement.\u201cFurthermore, the mermaids broke the agreement first. They would have needed help from the land in order to reach the Forest of Darkness.\u201d\u201cBut there is still a huge chance of danger. You know that, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNext came the second thing he needed to know.\u201cSo what is in it for me?\u201dCale informed them about the danger first before asking about this. A thick smile formed on Witira\u2019s face as she slowly started to speak.Cale knew what was going to come out of her mouth.It would be the same condition the Whale King had offered Choi Han in the novel.\u201cA sea route.\u201dCale started to smile.\u201cThere is a sea route that the mermaids have prioritized in their takeover. It is one that the humans have not found yet. It is the safest sea route available.\u201dCale asked, even though he already knew.\u201cWhere is it?\u201dWitira, who did not know Cale knew about it, confidently answered.\u201cOur ocean.\u201dThe Western continent\u2019s Northern Sea.\u201cIt is in the Whale tribe\u2019s territory.\u201dCale started to laugh as he asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t the Whale territory the most dangerous? It is the location of the ocean\u2019s strongest lifeforms.\u201d\u201cBut it is a safe place for you now, young master Cale. You will be given the rights to use that route.\u201dCale casually asked the confident Witira.\u201cBut I don\u2019t need it?\u201d\u201c...Excuse me?\u201dCale had absolutely no need for a sea route like that. It wasn\u2019t like they were giving him the sea route. They were just giving him the rights to use it. Cale did not need that sea route in order to live peacefully.However.\u201cLet me add one more condition.\u201dThe sea route will make his family wealthier and stronger. Of course, Basen will have to work even harder as the head of the territory, but that didn\u2019t matter to Cale. Cale could see the confusion in Witira\u2019s face, and answered the future Whale Queen.\u201cLend me your strength when I need it.\u201d\u201cOur strength?\u201d\u201cYes, strength. Two times.\u201dNothing else mattered to Cale other than keeping this Northeastern territory safe when the Northern knights headed down toward this warm and plentiful part of the continent. The whirlpools in the Ubarr sea and the naval base, why else would Cale have involved himself in all of this?It was because Cale was preparing for the future based on his knowledge of the novel.\u201cWe can\u2019t interfere with the issues of the land.\u201dCale looked at Witira\u2019s pale expression before casually adding on.\u201cSo you want me to put myself in danger, but you won\u2019t do the same?\u201d\u201c...We are a peace-seeking tribe.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you can say that when you have been fighting with the mermaids for so long.\u201dThe Whale tribe was feeling danger from the stronger mermaids. They had never felt such danger before. They probably wanted to completely get rid of that source of danger in order to maintain their peace.Cale continued to speak to the silent Witira.\u201cThe Forest of Darkness is one of the most dangerous and mysterious areas in the world. It is not somewhere you will have safe travels just because you are strong. Especially for someone like you, who does not know much about the land.\u201dCale was planning on heading to Harris Village anyways.\u201cI will help you.\u201dThe Forest of Darkness that Choi Han had lived in for tens of years. Choi Han did not know everything about the Forest of Darkness, even after spending that long in there. He just knew bits and pieces of it.And the human who knew the most about the Forest of Darkness after Choi Han was, of course, Cale.\u201cI think I know which swamp it is.\u201dWitira could see Cale smile as he gently answered.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the Whale tribe want a peaceful life as the strongest lifeform in the ocean?\u201dCale could see Witira\u2019s point of view starting to change. She was slowly changing from a position of request to a position of making a deal.\u201cYou are right, young master Cale.\u201dThe Whales that wanted peace. That was only possible because they were strong. The Whale tribe in the novel did anything and everything to fight the mermaids.\u201cI, Witira, as the successor of the Whale chief, accept your conditions.\u201dWItira could see that Cale was still calm after she revealed her identity.\u201cYou were the successor? Great. We can finalize our deal without delay.\u201dHe just seemed happy that they could complete the deal right then and there. He reached his hand out as he asked.\u201cAm I supposed to speak formally to you now?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to do that, young master Cale. I need to hide my identity.\u201d\u201cOnly I should know about it?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dCale shook hands with Witira. That was enough. Cale plopped down on the couch once the Whale siblings left. He then looked up at the ceiling and started to speak.\u201cHey you.\u201dThe Black Dragon appeared and grudgingly responded.\u201cDo not call me, \u2018you.\u2019\u201d\u201cThen what should I call you?\u201dCale could see the Black Dragon land on the other side of the couch and scrunch his nose.\u201cYou figure it out, human.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you first start calling me Cale instead of, \u2018human\u2019?\u201dCale watched the Black Dragon with curiosity in his eyes as it snorted and avoided answering Cale\u2019s question. However, he still said what he was planning on telling the dragon.\u201cDon\u2019t you want a house of your own?\u201dCale had been thinking about this for a while. If he was going to live with this Black Dragon, wouldn\u2019t it be great to give this, \u2018greatest lifeform in the world,\u2019 a fitting house?\u201cA house?\u201dThe dragon\u2019s wings started to flutter. Normally, dragons had a strong desire for independence. Although this one seemed a bit different, that desire should still be there. Cale casually nodded his head at the dragon\u2019s question.However, the Black Dragon\u2019s response was weird.\u201cAre you kicking me out?\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s wings were shaking and the mana in the area was starting to go wild. He seemed to be very angry. Cale immediately started to speak.\u201cMm, it\u2019s more of a villa.\u201d\u201c...A villa?\u201d\u201cYes. Somewhere that you, me, On, Hong, and the Wolves will go visit and have fun.\u201dOf course, some of that, \u2018fun,\u2019 would involve clearing the monsters in the Forest of Darkness. The Black Dragon stopped shaking his wings and comfortably laid down on the couch as he responded.\u201c...I will pick the location of villa.\u201dThe Black Dragon\u2019s eyes, that were slowly blinking like he was sleepy, suddenly became sharp as he looked toward Cale.\u201cIn return, you will pick my name for me. You have one month to figure it out.\u201dThe Black Dragon did not care about the flabbergasted look on Cale\u2019s face, and closed his eyes to take a nap. The Black Dragon had a satisfied smile on his face. Cale turned his head after hearing some snickers to see On and Hong immediately stop snickering, acting like nothing was going on, and ask Cale a question.\u201cWhen are we going home?\u201d\u201cI like fish, but I don\u2019t like the sea.\u201dCale answered the kittens.\u201cSoon.\u201dTwo days later, Cale got on the carriage with Amiru and the others seeing him out. The carriage started to speed up, and Cale closed the carriage curtains as he started to speak.\u201cYou can turn it off now.\u201dThe Whale siblings appeared after they turned the invisibility magic device off. The Black Dragon also revealed himself.Seeing the Black Dragon made Paseton flinch and Witira\u2019s pupils dilate. The Black Dragon put his head on Cale\u2019s leg and blankly looked toward the Whale siblings.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201c...That fluctuation of mana back then. That was you.\u201dThe Black Dragon and Witira stared at each other. The two of them was recognizing each other\u2019s strength. They also wanted to see how strong the other really was.At that moment.Pat.Cale\u2019s hand landed on the Black Dragon\u2019s head.\u201cLet\u2019s go home quietly.\u201dCale calmly stated and the Black Dragon quietly closed his eyes and went to sleep. The carriage immediately turned quiet.A few days later, Cale arrived back at Rain City in the Henituse territory, and immediately started to frown. [1]\u201cYoung master Cale-nim!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u2018How did the information from the capital reach here?\u2019Cale was looking at the people cheering at him and his group with a complicated expression.\u2018Did they forget about how he was trash?\u2019Of course, there were still people who immediately froze or ran away as soon as they saw his carriage.However, a new title was now associated with Cale.\u201cYoung master Silver Light!\u201d\u201cYoung master Shield-nim! Shield!\u201dCale started to frown again. He wanted to know if there was a way for him to avoid those cheesy nicknames.The Vice Captain then appeared within his line of sight. The Vice Captain, who was on a horse protecting the carriage, was proudly puffing up his chest with pride and started to speak as soon as he made eye contact with Cale.\u201cYoung master, your heroic deeds have spread! Haha.\u201dHe slowly guided the horse close to the carriage and continued to speak.\u201cI think the name of Young master Silver Light is very cool. I am jealous, young master.\u201dSlam.Cale slammed the carriage window closed in the Vice Captain\u2019s face.Cale did not care that the Whale siblings were looking at him with curiosity as he closed his eyes and crossed his arms.At that moment, The Black Dragon lightly tapped on Cale\u2019s knee with his paw. Cale slightly opened his eyes and looked down. The Black Dragon saw the expression on Cale\u2019s face and cautiously asked.\u201cAre we home?\u201dCale answered with disinterest.\u201cYes. We are home.\u201dOn and Hong started to stretch and the Black Dragon fluttered his wings. At that moment, Cale could hear the Vice Captain\u2019s voice through the closed window.\u201cYoung master. No need to be embarrassed!\u201d\u201cOo, Young master Silver Light!\u201dCale could hear the Vice Captain as well as someone cheering for him.\u2018That damn punk.\u2019Cale did not open his eyes again until they arrived at the Henituse estate. The trash who had left for the capital had returned home for a moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Swoosh.Cale\u2019s body was turned to the left and right against his will.Tap. Tap. Tap.Cale\u2019s shoulders, arms, face, and both hands were thoroughly inspected. Cale just had a blank expression during the entire process.\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t have any serious injuries.\u201dCount Deruth inspected Cale for a long time before finally smiling in relief. Cale put on a soulless smile and fixed up his messed up sleeves.Count Deruth was still strong because he still practiced with his sword every morning.\u201cHow is your condition? Are you tired?\u201d\u201cI am fine.\u201dOnce Count Deruth was finished, Countess Violan approached Cale.\u201cI heard you have more people with you now.\u201dShe was talking about the Wolf children and the Whale siblings. The Whale siblings currently looked completely different thanks to the Black Dragon\u2019s magic.\u201cYes, it somehow ended up that way.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCale could see the still flawless Violan\u2019s eyes turning chilly.\u00a0[1]\u201c...I heard they still have not caught the terrorists.\u201d\u201cThat is what I have heard as well.\u201d\u201cAlright. That\u2019ll do for now.\u201dViolan\u2019s gaze turned to Count Deruth, who also looked back at her as they exchanged messages through their eyes. Cale wondered what they might be conveying, but pretended not to know of their silent conversation. Their gazes looked like they were going to do something big. Count Deruth started to smile gently as he started to speak to Cale.\u201cWe can hear about the incident at the capital and your ancient power later, so go rest for now.\u201d\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d\u00a0[2]Cale could finally head to his room at the Count\u2019s suggestion. However, there were more people holding him back. They were his younger siblings, Basen and Lily.\u201cHyung-nim, how are you feel-.\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201dCale turned away from his siblings and motioned to deputy butler Hans. Hans immediately approached them.\u201cHere you go.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dCale handed the items he took from Hans to Basen and Lily.\u201cFountain pen for you, and a sword for you.\u201dCale had not forgotten about the items his siblings had asked him to get. He handed them their presents and looked at them before asking.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dBasen\u2019s face was stiff.\u201cI\u2019m sure it was chaotic.\u201d\u201cI still had to keep my promise.\u201dBasen listened to Cale\u2019s emotionless response and stared at him before clenching onto the box with the fountain pen and starting to speak.\u201cI will study very hard. I will work for this territory\u2019s administration and development.\u201d\u201cGood, good.\u201d\u2018You have to be the next Count, so it will be great for you to study administration.\u2019It was a great mindset in Cale\u2019s opinion. Cale started to smile while Basen hesitated for a moment before adding on.\u201cI will not do anything that will trouble you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cNothing, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dBasen did not say anything else after that. Cale looked toward Basen with curiosity before eventually turning away to look at his youngest sister, Lily Henituse.The expression on this little 7-year-old\u2019s face was oddly determined.\u2018Now what?\u2019\u201cEldest brother.\u201d\u201cLily.\u201d\u201cI will become strong enough to lead our knight\u2019s brigade and protect our territory. I will protect everyone.\u201d\u201cOh, I will be cheering you on.\u201dBasen with administration and Lily with the knights. The two of them will make the territory run properly. How great would this be for Cale? Cale caressed Lily\u2019s head with a satisfied expression.\u201cYou will make an awesome knight.\u201d\u201cThank you. I will make it so nobody has to get hurt.\u201d\u201cGood, good.\u201dCale stopped caressing her head and started to walk.\u201cI need to go get some rest now.\u201d\u201cHyung-nim, please rest well.\u201d\u201cYou must rest well in order to get better!\u201dCale waved at the two children and headed toward his room. The two siblings watched Cale walk away for a long time.Cale had returned to his room for the first time in a long time, but his room did not feel like it had been empty for a while.Meeeeow.Meeow.The two kittens rolling around on the bed seemed to be very excited, but Cale could not even put those kittens in his eyes, as he saw who was waiting for him outside his bedroom and started to frown.\u201c...You\u2019re going to be the one serving me?\u201dIt was Chef Beacrox. Was he trying to stop his duty as the Second Chef and do Ron\u2019s job? Beacrox ignored Cale\u2019s questioning gaze and handed him a letter.\u201cIt is a letter from my father.\u201d\u201cAh, Ron.\u201d\u201cHe told me it was a report.\u201dCale could see that the letter was not open. Although Ron had sent a letter through Hans when he had left, it seemed like he was now going to make his reports through his son.\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cI set it up so Maes and the rest of the Wolf children will help out with the kitchen and serving.\u201dBeacrox\u2019s shoulders flinched, but he managed to answer after a few seconds of silence.\u201c...I understand.\u201dHe seemed to be very weak while walking away, but Beacrox was doing a good job with the Wolf children so far.Click.Cale closed the bedroom door and the Black Dragon immediately appeared.\u201cOur house is great. Our house is very very great.\u201dThe Black Dragon jumped onto the bed with On and Hong in excitement. Cale snickered at the actions of the three children, whose average age was only 7-years-old, and leisurely opened up the letter. He then almost dropped the letter.< I am still alive. You are still alive too, right, young master? >The report had only a single line.How could there be such a scary report? However, it let Cale know that it was actually sent from Ron. Well, the writing and the seal they agreed upon before Ron had left also supported that it was from Ron.Knock knock knock.\u201cYoung master, may I enter?\u201dCale heard Hans\u2019s voice along with the knock. The kittens calmed down while the Black Dragon immediately turned invisible.\u201cEnter.\u201dHans entered with his arm full of snacks for the kittens as he started to speak.\u201cThe mage said it is fine to visit at any time.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now. You don\u2019t need to follow.\u201dCale left Hans in the room as he left to head to the administrative building.- Where are you going? To meet with a mage?Cale slightly nodded his head for the Black Dragon who followed him instead of staying back to play with On and Hong.Cale was certain that the dragon got interested in the word, \u2018mage.\u2019\u201cYoung master-nim, welcome back.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dThere were many people greeting Cale once he entered.\u201cHello, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cOh, long time no see.\u201d\u201cI heard you did something big. You are so amazing.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dCale found it to be annoying and sped up. The invisible Black Dragon observed everyone before starting to flap his wings a little stronger and following after Cale.The Black Dragon\u2019s ears flickered more and his smile became bigger as more and more people appeared to greet Cale.Cale did not know any of this as he opened the door to his destination. Of course, he knocked.\u201cYoung master-nim?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you before. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cIt is my honor.\u201dThis was the mage responsible for the territory\u2019s magic video communication. The video communication was usually handled by someone between the beginner and intermediate level.\u201cCan we connect right now?\u201d\u201cOf course. Where shall I connect you to?\u201dThe mage continued to peek at Cale as he prepared the video communication device. The territory was currently filled with stories about Cale Henituse. Maybe that was why, but the mage couldn\u2019t help but be curious about who Cale wanted to contact as soon as he got home.Cale did not know about the mage\u2019s curiosity, as he casually answered.\u201cThe palace.\u201d\u201cAh, the palac- the palace?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale added on to specify a bit more.\u201cConnect me to his highness, the crown prince.\u201dCale saw the hesitating mage, and lightly started to frown.\u201cWhy? Is it not possible? Then can I just leave a voice message?\u201d\u201cAh, no. It is possible. Of course it is possible.\u201dSince the palace received so many video communications, it was possible to leave behind a video or voice message, since it might not be possible for the palace to accept all requests due to the sheer number of requests.\u2018This world is quite comfortable, other than the fact that you need mages for things every so often.\u2019The mage seemed to be flustered as he set the device to the palace and reported to Cale.\u201cIt looks like it will be difficult to connect right now, but you should be able to leave a voice message for his highness.\u201dCale preferred to talk face to face, but it wasn\u2019t really necessary. Cale nodded his head and the mage started the device before heading out of the room. Once Cale was certain that the mage was out of the room, he started to speak toward the device.\u201cYour highness, it is Cale Henituse.\u201dHe got straight to the point as usual.\u201cI plan on buying the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s Magic Tower.\u201dThe first use of the golden plaque. Cale imagined the look on the crown prince\u2019s face once he heard this message. Cale also knew that Alberu had no choice but to approve. Alberu might act flustered and annoyed, but he would actually like what Cale was doing. He would also be curious.That was why Cale added on another sentence.\u201cFor your information, I will not be able to communicate via video or voice communication for a week. I need to head somewhere for a bit. I just wanted to let you know in advance.\u201dCale then pressed the button the mage told him to press once he was done. A blue light appeared on the device to signal that the voice message was left.He then called the mage back in and the mage looked at the light before starting to speak.\u201cIt looks like the message was left properly.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThe mage saw the smile on Cale\u2019s face and decided to speak.\u201cIt looks like you left a pretty happy message?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess so.\u201dThe crown prince would probably hear the message tomorrow. Cale was smiling about how the crown prince would be waiting a week for his return.- ...I feel bad for the crown prince.The Black Dragon suddenly started to feel bad for the crown prince. Cale ignored the comment and headed out of the communication room before heading toward the estate to look for Count Deruth. He wanted to take care of everything at once while he was here.***\u201cYou want to go to Harris Village?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale nodded his head at Count Deruth\u2019s question. He had told his father about both the ancient power and Harris Village. However, Count Deruth was focused on Harris Village.Deruth looked down at the, \u2018Harris Village Incident Report,\u2019 in Cale\u2019s hands before looking up at his son. Cale\u2019s gaze looked serious. He really meant it.Harris Village.Count Deruth had headed over after hearing the report from the investigation squad. He felt anger and sorrow once he saw what had happened.The village really was completely destroyed, and there were no signs of the perpetrators.That was why he had asked for cooperation from the nearby territories, as well as reaching out to the Information Guild to keep their ears open for any information.\u201c...Is it because you are concerned about that young man named Choi Han?\u201dCount Deruth had found signs of a battle at Harris Village. That allowed him to estimate the level of Choi Han\u2019s strength. There was no way that his son, who had spent a longer time with Choi Han, would not know about his strength.\u201cI guess you could call it that.\u201dCale nodded at Deruth\u2019s words. That was the only excuse he could give anyways.He could not say that he wanted to go there for the Wolf children\u2019s berserk transformation and wild instinct training. He could not say it was for the Black Dragon\u2019s growth. He definitely could not say that he was going to the Forest of Darkness to find a solution to the Whale tribe\u2019s war against the mermaids.Cale continued on, as he could see that Count Deruth was contemplating.\u201cThe investigation squad has already completed their investigation, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Plus, I don\u2019t even need to worry about the monsters. It is not winter.\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201dThe monsters of the Forest of Darkness. There was a large man-made stone wall between Harris Village and the Forest of Darkness. It was to protect against these monsters.\u00a0[3]There have been no monster attacks in the last 150 years. maybe people were scared because there are so many stories about how you\u2019ll die if you go into the Forest of Darkness, but it was very rare for an actual monster to appear.The problem was that any monsters that actually came out were extremely strong mutant \u00a0monsters.The Count found the fact that no monsters have appeared in 150 years to be odd, and so he had sent multiple investigation squads, but they could only roam around the Forest of Darkness without actually going in.Finally, Count Deruth started to speak.\u201cThere are still soldiers in Harris Village, so it should be safe.\u201dHe seemed to have made up his mind and continued to speak.\u201cYou have to take care of the people you have taken in.\u201dCale slowly shook his head. It was an unbelievable misunderstanding.\u201cChoi Han is not my subordinate.\u201dHave Choi Han as his subordinate? Cale would never do such a thing. Deruth smiled at his son before nodding his head.\u201cSure. Whatever you say. You are all grown up now.\u201d\u201cOf course. I am 18 years old.\u201d\u201cYou grew up so fast. Alright. You can go now.\u201dCale bowed to his father before turning around to head to the door. He could hear count Deruth\u2019s voice behind him.\u201cCale.\u201dDeruth continued to speak as Cale turned back around.\u201cThe golden turtle has not always been our family crest. We are a family of warriors who are sworn to protect our family and anything else.\u201dThe two of them made eye contact.\u201cWe protect everything with our strong shell. However, you must remember that the most important thing is to protect yourself. That is why we are a turtle.\u201dA turtle that protects itself with its strong shell. Count Deruth, who was known for being mediocre in all aspects by others, reminded his son once more.\u201cThat is why you should always remember to put yourself first.\u201dHe then smiled gently and added on.\u201cThe ancient power you have earned is very cool.\u201dCale smiled similarly to Count Deruth, as he jokingly answered.\u201cIsn't it? It is a very cool power. Oh, and I always put my own safety first.\u201d\u201cGood. Then I'm glad.\u201dCale observed Deruth nod his head and look back down at the report on the desk before heading out of the office. The Black Dragon had a question for him as soon as they left.-The two of you are family, right?Cale nodded his head at the question.The next day, Cale got onto the carriage as he started to speak to the Whale siblings.\u201cNot bad for my new guards.\u201dWitira with her whip in her hand and Paseton with a sword in his hand, both smiled toward Cale. They were still under the Black Dragon\u2019s appearance magic. Cale started to head toward Harris Village, well, the Forest of Darkness, to be more accurate.1. :O If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say this is Beacrox\u2019s mom!2. I\u2019m sorry, I just had to. It was the perfect opportunity.3. \u2026 The Henituse family is the Night\u2019s Watch \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His thoughtss once he got there were simple.\u201cIt\u2019s black.\u201dIt had been a little longer than two months, but Harris Village was still dark. Cale looked down toward his feet to see that there were still black ashes on the ground.He then looked back forward and heard the Vice Captain\u2019s bitter voice.\u201cEverything burned down.\u201dCale turned around to look at Vice Captain Hilsman.\u201cWhere did they say the graves were?\u201d\u201cI will go find out.\u201dIt had been a while since Cale had seen Vice Captain Hilsman being so calm, but it wasn't Hilsman\u2019s fault.A large stone wall. Harris Village, The village located outside of that wall heading into the Forest of Darkness, was no more. All that was left was the crumbling ruins of houses and dark ashes that served as signs that something once existed in this location.\u201cI feel a strong sensation of fire here.\u201d\u201cYou can feel something like that?\u201d\u201cI am from a tribe of the sea after all.\u201dWitira lightly smiled and responded, but then she seemed to get emotional. However, Cale did not have time to pay attention to her. He headed over to the Wolf children who did not seem to be able to get off the carriage.\u201cMaes.\u201d\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201dThe eldest Wolf, Maes, was stiff after seeing the remains of the village in front of him. Cale was pretty sure that they were currently thinking of their hometown.\u201cDo you know why I brought all of you here?\u201dMaes could not answer Cale's question. Cale had not told him why he brought all of them here. It was a small group such that even deputy butler Hans and Beacrox were not here, but they were included.Maes looked toward Cale with uncertainty. The young master that Lock told them to serve leisurely started to speak with his arms crossed.\u201cA lot of money is about to fall into my hands.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe sudden talk about money confused Maes and the Wolf children. Cale just continued to speak without care. The Magic Tower and the Queen of the Jungle. He would have a ton of money after these two interactions. He was also going to bring the rights to a peaceful sea route to his territory.\u201cAnd I plan on using some of that money to rebuild this village.\u201dThe term, \u2018village,\u2019 caught the children\u2019s attention.\u201cI also plan on building a villa here for all of you, me, and the rest of the group to play together.\u201d\u201c...I heard the Forest of Darkness is dangerous.\u201d\u201cAre you being serious?\u201dCale questioned Maes and looked around. On and Hong were getting off the carriage and the Black Dragon was probably flying around somewhere. The Whale siblings were approaching a well that was covered in ashes.\u201cWill they be stronger than all of you when you grow up?\u201dThe blunt question reached the Wolf children's ears.\u201cI promised Lock that I would take good care of all of you. That means I also have to provide a place for you to live like the Wolves you are.\u201dThe moment a smile that seemed to say that it was not hard to accomplish at all appeared on Cale's face, a cold wind passed by them. Once some of the black ashes flew away with the wind, Cale's voice once again filled the void.\u201cI will create that place for you. I will help you grow and develop into great Wolves before Lock gets back.\u201dCale looked toward Maes and the Wolf children and started to frown.\u201cNo response?\u201d\u201c...Y, yes!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dCale was not satisfied with the children\u2019s answer and started to walk away. Maes looked toward Cale, who was walking toward the wall, before turning around. His younger siblings were all looking at him.Maes started to speak.\u201c...Let\u2019s all grow strong.\u201dMaes then looked around the village. He was thinking about how this black village would one day become a warm place like the hometown in his mind. Maes could feel that his siblings were feeling the same way, even though they did not say anything.They were all Wolves.Cale did not know about the Wolves\u2019 determinations as he tapped on the Stone Wall.\u201cIt\u2019s quite thick.\u201dCale turned his head to see the only gate on the wall. This Stone Gate was the only access point to the Forest of Darkness. Of course, Choi Han did not use this gate when he first arrived at Harris Village. He jumped over the approximately 10-meter tall wall to enter.\u201cIs the Forest of Darkness past this wall?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dCale peeked over to Witira, who had approached him. Her blue hair and pupils were both dyed brown with magic, and her face was also magically changed to an average face. However, her voice was still just as beautiful.\u201cI can\u2019t see past the wall, but it should be pretty unique seeing as how it is one of the Forbidden Regions, right? I wonder if the wall is strong.\u201dWitira smiled as she lightly pressed onto the wall with her index finger. However, that finger stabbed right into the wall.\u201c...Haha.\u201dWitira awkwardly started to laugh.\u2018Whales really are a scary race.\u2019Cale pretended not to see and turned away. These two long-haired siblings were still not used to controlling their strength on land. Cale quickly changed the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d\u201cHmm? What is?\u201d\u201cPast the wall. You said it probably looks unique.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dWitira let out a small gasp and Cale just shrugged his shoulders. He turned away from the wall as he continued to speak.\u201cThe Forest of Darkness is a regular forest, just like any other.\u201dCale saw that Witira had quickly approached him and was walking at the same pace as him and continued.\u201cBut the thing inside of it is different.\u201dNobody knew the reason why, but the Forest of Darkness often had mutated plants and monsters. It was easy to tell the mutated monsters apart because they looked different, but it was more difficult for the plants. Although they might look similar, a mutated version of an herb used for healing could end up being poisonous.\u2018And there are also monsters that are generally found in the Eastern Continent as well.\u2019That was why it was one of the Forbidden Regions. It was the one place on this continent that they could find traces of the Eastern Continent.\u201cYoung master-nim!\u201dCale nodded toward Vice Captain Hilsman, who had called out to him, before turning back to speak to Witira.\u201cPlease take care of the children.\u201d\u201cOf course. There are quite a lot of young Beast people.\u201dWitira quietly watched Cale who sighed with an annoyed expression at her statement. Cale then turned around and headed toward Hilsman.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dCale only had Hilsman with him as they headed to a certain location.\u201cHere it is.\u201dMany graves were located here. This was where Choi Han had buried all of the villagers of the Harris Village.Hilsman moved away from Cale and went to stand with the soldiers before looking toward Cale. The fact that Cale Henituse came to this village was surprising, but the fact that he looked for the graves as soon as he got off the carriage was even more surprising.The Vice Captain had moved away to give Cale some alone time. Of course, Cale didn\u2019t even realize or care about the Vice Captain\u2019s action and just started to talk to himself.\u201c...The fact that he didn\u2019t go crazy is amazing.\u201dThe fact that Choi Han remained sane after this incident was amazing.Choi Han seemed to have put a lot of effort into these graves, but they were mostly just made with dirt. In addition, they did not have any gravestones, instead they just had their names written on flat pieces of rock. Cale counted the number of graves.Choi Han had personally buried all of the bodies underneath the graves.Cale had an interesting thought every so often. The reason behind the death of the Harris Village villagers that had remained a mystery in the novel. The novel made it sound like it was done for the main character to develop. But was that really it?\u2018I feel like there is more to it.\u2019He kept having this feeling that there was more to the story these days. The reason was simple.The Forest of Darkness, mermaids, and the destruction of Harris Village.These three things gave Cale a scenario. However, this was a problem he would tell Lock to share with Choi Han or, if Choi Han ended up coming back with Lock, he would pass it off to Choi Han himself.Harris Village was not Cale\u2019s problem but Choi Han\u2019s problem.\u201cHilsman.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dSo all Cale did was what he needed to do as a member of the Henituse family.\u201cTell them to give them proper graves in the future. This is too shabby.\u201d\u201c...Yes sir!\u201dCale patted Hilsman, who responded more energetically than usual, on the shoulder before looking toward the soldiers. The soldiers slowly moved back and Cale kept his hand on Hilsman's shoulder and whispered.\u201cYou know what to do?\u201dAll sorts of emotions appeared on Hilsman's face as he recalled what had happened two nights ago. They were camping out in the when Cale called him over to his tent.\u2018I will be going into the Forest of Darkness.\u2019\u2018What? Why would someone in recovery go somewhere so dangerous? \u00a0The perpetrators will not be in there. Do you have to do so much for Choi Han-.\u2019The small Black Dragon appeared while Hilsman was talking. He was extremely surprised when it had happened. But that was not the end.Meeeeeow.The kittens meowed before turning into people. They were Beast people. Furthermore, the Vice Captain felt chills for the first time in his life after seeing the woman pull out a long water whip and the man holding a sword with a whirlpool at its end.\u2018Don't worry.\u2019At the center of all of these strong monsters was Cale, who had a relaxed smile on his face. The fact that Cale seemed so normal around them made Hilsman even more shocked.Hilsman had made up his mind in the last two days. Although he was someone whose only goal was to become captain, he still wasn't an idiot.\u201cYes, I got it, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dCale turned away without any other issues from Hilsman. Hilsman followed right behind Cale, who continued to speak.\u201cI trust you.\u201dThat made Hilsman clench his fists. He had thought that it would be enough if he could make it to the Captain position in the Henituse Knights\u2019 brigade. However, his mentality had changes in the last two days. He shared his thoughts with Cale.\u201cYoung master-nim, I will get stronger.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dCale answered disinterestedly, only feeling relieved that it sounded like Hilsman would take care of the headaches.That was why there were no guards by where Cale was standing in the middle of the night. The Vice-Captain had changed the patrol areas. Cale touched his magic bag while standing in front of the Stone Wall and started to speak.\u201cThere are two swamps in the Forest of Darkness.\u201dThis large forest only had two swamps. Cale leisurely continued to speak after making eye contact with Paseton.\u201cOne is where monsters live and the other is where nothing can live.\u201dHe then asked Paseton.\u201cPaseton, you said it looked like the mermaids\u2019 poison got stronger. So then which one do you think it will be?\u201dPaseton nervously answered.\u201cI think it is the one where nothing can live.\u201d\u201cCorrect. There is a high chance it will be that one. That is why we will be heading there first.\u201dThey could head for the one with the monsters if the first one was not correct. That was actually easier location-wise as well.At that moment, Witira, who had been quietly standing there, looked to Cale\u2019s sides with concern. She then hesitated for a bit before finally asking the question.\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous for the children?\u201dOn and Hong were dangling on Cale\u2019s sides.\u201cYoung master Cale, you said that the Forest of Darkness is dangerous. And if it is a swamp where nothing can live, it is definitely either that there is poison everywhere or that the swamp itself is dangerous.\u201dWitira felt something was odd as she continued to speak. The Cat Tribe\u2019s silver kitten On\u2019s tail was happily wagging.\u201cA dangerous place like that is our specialty. But more importantly, he said we will not get hurt.\u201dThe Cat Tribe was cautious and talented in searches. Witira looked up at Cale because On\u2019s response was not what she had expected. Her eyes then turned wide.It was because Cale was smirking and the other Cat Tribe child, the red kitten, was also smiling. Both of their smiles seemed villainous. Hong seemed to be very excited as he started to speak.\u201cI\u2019m going to get stronger today. It\u2019ll be fine!\u201dIt was time to improve the poisonous fog.A safe encounter for the children, who wanted to get stronger, and Cale, who wanted safety and peace, had arrived. Cale started to speak to Witira.\u201cIt is a great opportunity.\u201dA poison fog strong enough to impact even the Whale tribe might be completed here if they were lucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They would soon find out about On and Hong\u2019s skills.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe Black Dragon started to fly up toward the top of the Stone Wall and Cale\u2019s body started to float while following behind it. Naturally, On and Hong were in Cale\u2019s arms as he headed up.\u201cPaseton.\u201dPaseton nodded his head at Witira\u2019s after she called out his name, and the Whale siblings started to run up the Stone Wall at a quick pace. Water surrounded their feet and shot them up with every step.Swiiiiiiish.Cale cut through the wind and reached the top of the wall.\u201cWow.\u201dHong\u2019s voice was full of admiration.The Forest of Darkness and its vast natural setting appeared in front of the group.This was the second largest of the five Forbidden Regions, starting from the tip of the northeast part of the Roan Kingdom and creating an oval shape until the eastern shoreline.It was as large as two or three average sized territories. That was why the Roan Kingdom wanted to take control of this land, but nobody was able to do so until now.\u2018The Black Dragon or Choi Han might be able to do it.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s big.\u201dCale casually commented before verifying the Stone Mountain at the center of the forest.Unlike its name, the Forest of Darkness was not actually dark at all times. In fact, the forest, that was starting to light up from the rising sun, was actually beautiful to look at.\u201cGoing down.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dThe Black Dragon slowly lowered Cale and the kittens to the ground. The Whale siblings were already down there waiting for them.Crunch.Cale lightly landed on the ground and stepped on some leaves underneath his feet.\u201cYou said that the Forest of Darkness is divided into regions?\u201dCale nodded at Witira\u2019s question and lowered On and Hong onto the ground. He then opened up his magic bag as he started to answer Witira\u2019s question.\u201cIt is divided into the outer and inner regions.\u201dThis large forest was divided into two stages. The first stage was the outer region, which was not that dangerous. There were only a few mutant monsters, and the majority were small monsters. On the other hand, the second stage, the inner region with the Stone Mountain at its center, was extremely dangerous.\u2018Even Choi Han needed tens of years to freely move around the second stage.\u2019Freely moving around meant that there was no danger. Choi Han became stronger than all of the monsters. Of course, such an issue was not a concern for Cale\u2019s group.\u201cThe swamp we are heading to is at the border of the inner and outer regions. It should not be too dangerous.\u201dThe outer region was large, but that was based on its width. It would not be very far if they walked in a straight line. The inner region was much larger, as it was in the shape of an oval.\u201cI plan on avoiding as many monsters as possible, but I don\u2019t see a reason to delay our travel by taking roundabout ways.\u201dThe fact that Cale did not plan to go out of his way to avoid monsters made the Whale siblings start to smile. As long as they were not going up against a dragon, there was nothing that the Humpback Whale beast people, the rulers of the ocean, had to fear.\u201cI am removing my magic.\u201dOnce the Black Dragon said that, the Whale siblings\u2019 appearances returned to normal. Witira started to smile with a refreshed expression.\u201cAh. So refreshing. It was a bit stuffy under that magic. Thank you very much, dragon-nim.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Dragon-nim.\u201dThe Black Dragon flapped its wings at Witira and Paseton\u2019s thanks before approaching Cale. The Black Dragon had an odd expression on its face.\u201cThe mana is dark here.\u201d\u201cDark?\u201dThe Black Dragon nodded at Cale\u2019s question and looked around the forest.\u201cThere is also a smell.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of smell?\u201d\u201cSomething I am familiar with. But I cannot tell what it is.\u201d\u2018Familiar but can\u2019t tell?\u2019Cale looked toward the Black Dragon with a confused expression, but the Black Dragon quickly looked away. He then continued to speak.\u201cIt is not a dangerous smell. Just a very old one.\u201d\u2018Do dragons have a really good sense of smell?\u2019Cale was curious, but was not able to remain curious for a long period of time.\u201cWhat do we do from here? How do we get to the swamp?\u201dWitira could see Cale taking a piece of paper out of the magic bag. She then saw him open it up.\u201c... A map?\u201dIt definitely was a map, but it was a pretty terrible one. However, it did have the Stone Mountain in the center with multiple other areas designated on it.\u201cYes, it is a map.\u201dCale had used the information he read in, \u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 to create a map.< Choi Han decided to expand outward, starting from the Stone Mountain. He was going to start with the north and eventually make his way through the entire Forest of Darkness. >< ...Choi Han finally figured out the entire inner region and then started to explore the outer region. >< ...Choi Han started to cry once he saw the large Stone Wall. The southern part of the outer region, the last section he had left to check, that was where he had found people. It had taken too long to get here. >\u201cBut it is not very accurate. We need to experience it ourselves to explore and understand the Forest of Darkness.\u201dCale then looked at Witira and Paseton, who were looking at him silently, and continued.\u201cSo, take the lead.\u201dThe Black Dragon was already flapping its wings and looking at the Whale siblings from behind Cale. Witira smiled and reached her hand out to Cale, who took a water bottle out of the magic bag and handed it to her.Witira drank the water before reaching her hand back out.Swooooooooosh.A three meter long whip appeared in her hand. She flicked it once before wrapping it around her arm and then joked with the group.\u201cI will safely get you to your destination.\u201dCale found her to be reliable. A Humpback Whale. The royal family of the ocean was said to be able to easily handle the Killer Whale beast people, the troublemakers of the sea.However, he did not plan to do as she said. But there was no need to tell her that right now. He then pointed to the entrance of the Forest of Darkness.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCale stepped into the Forest of Darkness.The forest was not loud, but there were many different noises echoing inside. The sounds of insects, the roars of monsters in the distance, birds chirping, and even some other strange monster noises.\u201cAren\u2019t dangerous places usually quiet?\u201dPaseton cut through the bushes with his sword as he asked Cale.\u201cThat is only when there is a single ruler in the area.\u201dThe Forest of Darkness did not have a ruler. There was just a relationship of eat or get eaten.\u201cBe careful with your shoes. Make sure your skin does not get revealed.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dPaseton looked down at the extra cloth between his pants and shoes and then looked back up at Cale. Cale\u2019s magic bag really was a magical bag. It had all sorts of items inside, and they were all necessary items for their travels.\u2018You need to be careful of your ankles here. The insects are dangerous too. You can get poisoned if you are bitten.\u2019Paseton recalled what Cale had told them and wondered how Cale knew about all of this. However, he could not easily ask because Cale was still very busy.\u201cLook forward.\u201d\u201cAh, yes sir!\u201dCale\u2019s blunt voice made Paseton quickly turn back forward and follow behind his sister Witira to clear their path. They were currently passing through short bushes that reached their waists.Cale was furiously recording new information onto his map.\u2018It might be useless.\u2019Cale wondered if there really was a reason for him to make a map of the Forest of Darkness. It wasn\u2019t like he was planning on conquering the Forest of Darkness. However, he had a gut feeling that there would be a way for him to sell this in the future.Cale\u2019s style was to do things right so that it could be used in the future to make money in the future if possible.\u201cWe are almost through this bushy area.\u201d\u201cNext is the small monsters area.\u201dWitira nodded at Cale\u2019s statement and leisurely flicked her whip. Honestly speaking, this group was so strong Cale did not need to be nervous. Maybe that was why, but Witira was calm once they got past the bushy area and arrived at the small monsters area.Crack.A branch broke under her foot. At that moment.\u201cLet\u2019s proceed quietly.\u201dCale commented while two sounds of something moving in the air suddenly appeared.Paaat!Paat!Witira lightly waved her hand and there were some poisonous darts between her fingers.Cale could see Witira turning around and smiling at him.\u201cI will take care of them quietly.\u201dSome monsters started to reveal themselves from behind the trees. Witira looked toward them with a blank expression.\u201cAre they mutated goblins?\u201d\u201cKeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\u201d\u201cKirik, Kirik!\u201dThey seemed to be larger than the average goblins and their faces looked a bit different as well. Furthermore, their skin was purple and red.\u201cNo, they are not goblins.\u201dWItira turned toward the hand that was placed upon her shoulder. Cale stood next to Witira and looked out toward the monsters approaching them.\u201cYoung master, it is dangerous in the front.\u201d\u201cThey are Honta, a type of monster from the Eastern continent.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThe Forest of Darkness had monsters from the Eastern Continent. Cale had encountered the first of the bunch.\u201cThey are similar to goblins, but dumber and have a tendency to be more cruel and violent.\u201d\u201cNo wonder they seemed so foreign.\u201dWitira nodded her head and calmly answered.\u201cI will take care of them.\u201d\u201cNo, I will do it.\u201d\u201c...Excuse me?\u201dWitira was blankly staring at Cale until she saw On and Hong jump over Cale and land on the ground. The two of them brushed their bodies off and prepared for battle.\u201cEven we can do this much.\u201dWitira could see that over 10 of these small monsters were heading toward them. She then looked back at Cale and saw that his body was becoming surrounded by fog. At the same time, On started to slowly disappear.\u201cI have something to test.\u201dCale needed to know approximately how strong he was. This was the perfect time to test it out.He had the Black Dragon to the right, Witira to the left, and Paseton behind him. Wasn\u2019t this the perfect setting for him to run wild without worrying about being harmed?\u201cStep back.\u201d\u201c...Young master Cale.\u201d\u201cSave me if it looks dangerous. How can I get hurt when I have all of you here?\u201dWitira took a step back after seeing the completely confident gaze in Cale\u2019s eyes that seemed to show full trust in the three of them. She went and stood with Paseton in the rear, ready to step in at any moment.At that moment, a shield was created around Witira and Paseton. The Black Dragon moved in front of the Whale siblings and started to speak.\u201cThe poison is stronger than it looks.\u201d\u2018Poison?\u2019That made Paseton look at his sister with confusion. Witira didn\u2019t have any idea as well, so she just shook her head and looked forward before letting out a gasp of admiration.\u201c... Not bad.\u201dOn, Hong, and Cale were all surrounded by fog. Furthermore, the color of the fog was weird. It was closer to red than the usual white.Poison. She seemed to understand the meaning of that word.\u201cKirik, kirik!\u201d\u201cKiriiiiiiiiiirik!\u201d\u201cSo loud.\u201dCale created gusts of wind in one hand and both feet while being surrounded by the fog. Cale could feel the Vitality of the Heart starting to run wild in his chest and gave the order.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCale\u2019s body instantly shot forward, and, at the same time, a thick fog surrounded the area.\u201cKirik? Kirik, kirik!\u201d\u201cKiiii!\u201dThe fog was so thick that you could not even see a few inches in front of your eyes.Two strands of red fog started to move inside that thick fog.Bang!A whirlwind shot up to the sky and cut off one of the monster\u2019s arms in the process.\u201cGek, kirik, kek!\u201dThe red fog swallowed up that monster. Cale then shot up from right next to the spot and called forth his shield. The shield that was almost twice the size as Cale was roaming around the red fog.Then suddenly, the shield dropped straight toward the ground.Boom!The sound of something being squashed came along with the loud noise.As soon as the shield landed, a whirlwind filled with red fog was created right next to it. Two monsters who were caught up in the whirlwind were vomiting blood as they got blasted into the air.\u201cKek.\u201d\u201cUgh, kek!\u201dThe monsters\u2019 poisoned bodies started to bleed out of every orifice.Paseton blankly watched that scene before blurting out.\u201cI thought you said he was weak?\u201d\u201cHe is weak.\u201dPaseton started to think after hearing the Black Dragon\u2019s confident answer.\u2018They may be small, but there are over ten of them. And they are monsters that are stronger than goblins.\u2019He looked toward his sister, who casually answered while smiling brightly.\u201cLooks like it will end soon.\u201dBoom!Another loud noise was heard as the fog slowly started to dissipate. It had finished like she had said.Paseton could now see Cale.\u201cThey must be weak because we are still only near the entrance.\u201dCale was speaking confidently while standing on top of his symbol, the silver shield. Underneath the shield were two monsters that were no longer recognizable.Meeeeow.The fog disappeared and the silver kitten On reappeared.\u201cThe poison seems to be weak.\u201dThe red kitten Hong reappeared while shaking his tail. The ground where Hong had been was completely black. Hong used his back paws to cover up the black dirt with some other dirt.It was a peaceful scene, but Paseton couldn\u2019t help but ask after seeing the corpse of a monster that died from poison, a monster that was still dying from poison, and the monsters that died from being crushed by Cale\u2019s shield or Cale\u2019s whirlwinds.\u201cYoung master-nim, you didn\u2019t get hurt, right?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dPaseton urgently asked in shock.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt?\u201dCale pointed to the back of his hand.\u201cI got scratched.\u201dPaseton immediately shut up. Witira patted her brother\u2019s shoulder before approaching Cale. Cale lifted his shield up and put it away. Since it was an ancient power, he didn\u2019t need to even wipe the blood off of it. It would be completely clean when he summoned it again.\u201cYoung master Cale, will you continue to take on the small monsters?\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201dCale washed the blood off of his hand after recalling his shield and whirlwinds.\u201cI can\u2019t push myself too hard because I am still in recovery.\u201dWItira couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the confident Cale, as well as On and Hong, who were getting feedback from the Black Dragon about their battle. Cale then urged her, as well as the rest of them, on.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201dThey still had a lot of ground to cover.Two days later, Cale lowered the map in his hand and looked out in front of him as he spoke to the rest of the group.\u201cWe are close now.\u201dThe boundary between the inner and outer regions. It would not be much longer until they reached that point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Black Dragon came over to report.\u201cAll done.\u201dClose to twenty of these fox-like animals were dead.\u2018They really are getting stronger with experience.\u2019On and Hong could not learn properly because they had to live in hiding as they had run away from their tribe. The Black Dragon naturally lacked experience after living in confinement his entire life. Cale was using the Forest of Darkness\u2019s monsters to quickly fill those gaps in their training.\u201cShould I have fought as well?\u201dWhere else would he get an opportunity to safely build experience? The Black Dragon and the kittens all abruptly turned their heads as Cale mumbled to himself.\u201cSeems like a useless idea!\u201d\u201cWeak human, it is too much for you at this point. One day is enough.\u201d\u201cOur youngest is right. You spit out blood from using the shield too much last time!\u201dPaseton let out a gasp.\u201c...Ho.\u201dHowever, Cale could see that Witira was just smiling brightly. He then saw her caress her whip with a determined gaze.That was the look of someone who wanted to fight. She really was a scary person.Cale quickly opened up his magic bag and gathered everyone around him.\u201cEverybody put this on before you go any farther.\u201d\u201cIs it because of poison?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale answered Paseton\u2019s question before putting the mask on the Black Dragon, who stuck his head toward him.\u201cHuman. There is a weird scent.\u201dThe Black Dragon frequently said this to Cale since a few days ago.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It is stronger here. It is something I am familiar with.\u201d\u201cIt is probably poison or the rotting smell from the nearby plants.\u201dCale brushed it off and approached On. The Black Dragon that was ignored tilted his head while wearing the mask.The Black Dragon started to mumble, but the mask prevented Cale from being able to hear what he was saying.\u201c...No. It is not such a trivial scent.\u201dHowever, the Black Dragon remained quiet because it was not a dangerous scent.Cale then put the mask on On\u2019s face.\u2018Even Choi Han avoided this swamp.\u2019Choi Han had a pretty high resistance to poison. However, there was no reason to go through the swamp when there were many other paths in the Forest of Darkness while this path was messy and annoying.Paseton approached Cale.\u201cIt is really interesting that there are only two swamps in a forest this large.\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dPaseton could see Cale\u2019s starting to smirk from underneath the mask. It was a pretty sly smirk.\u201cYou\u2019ll understand once you see it.\u201dTwo swamps were enough. Cale verified that everyone had their masks on and checked their expressions. They had only been sleeping between 1 - 3 hours a night ever since they entered the Forest of Darkness.\u201cYou all look so healthy.\u201dNobody looked tired.\u201cAll of you really are amazing.\u201dPaseton\u2019s face scrunched up at Cale\u2019s comment. He looked over to his sister and asked with his gaze.\u2018Should he really be saying that?\u2019Witira shrugged her shoulders and avoided answering the question. Paseton turned back to look at Cale, who looked to be the healthiest of the group right now.Paseton then looked toward the Black Dragon and the kittens. They rushed over to look after Cale whenever they thought Cale was tired. Of course, Cale was full of energy thanks to the Vitality of the Heart, but nobody else knew about that.Witira continued to caress the whip on her arm as she asked Cale.\u201cYoung master Cale, is it our turn now?\u201dCale pointed with his foot instead of responding.Right there was the boundary between the outer and inner regions.\u201cGrrrrrrrr.\u201d\u201cCaaaaaaw!\u201d\u201cSqueeeeeak-\u201dA plethora of noises poured out toward Cale as soon as he stepped past the boundary. He then proceeded to speak to Witira, who took a step past the boundary as well.\u201cGo.\u201dA humanized Humpback Whale. This ruler of the sea was not the type to be careful.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201dFlick.Witira flicked her whip as soon as Cale finished speaking.Boom!A large crater was created on the ground from the flick of the whip.\u201cGrrrrr.\u201d\u201cKeeeeeeeeee.\u201d\u201cSqueeeeeeak.\u201dThe noises disappeared.Witira, someone whose strength fell between Choi Han and the Black Dragon, was itching for a fight. Her heart had been beating wildly while looking at the better-than-expected skills of the group.\u201cShall we hurry on?\u201dShe smiled and asked Cale as this mysterious young master responded back with a completely relaxed smile.\u201cYes, as fast as possible. I want to go home and rest.\u201dPaseton let out a sigh after hearing what Cale had to say, before taking out his whirlpool sword.The enemies slowly started to reveal themselves in the now quiet forest.The boundary between the outer and inner regions was a location for monsters that were weaker than the monsters in the inner region, but the monsters in front of them were still much stronger than the so-called weak monsters outside.Mutant ogres, mutant trolls, spider-like monsters from the Eastern Continent, and even high-level monsters appeared.\u201cThe monsters here really are different. They still want to fight, even after seeing Dragon-nim.\u201dPaseton stepped forward and peeked back and forth between the Black Dragon and Cale. Cale nodded his head and gave an order.\u201cHurry up and fight.\u201d\u201c...Yes sir.\u201dPaseton jumped forward and the battle between the strong monsters and the Whale siblings began.The monsters in the Forest of Darkness did not get scared, even in front of strong creatures like a dragon or members of the Whale tribe. In fact, it made them charge at them even harder. It was like they were fighting for their survival, thinking that they could not allow a strong person who could rule over them to appear within their Forest of Darkness.Cale leisurely watched for a bit until he saw a shield being cast, whereupon he asked the Black Dragon.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cToo annoying to deal with those weaklings.\u201d\u201cSure. Let\u2019s go.\u201dCale started to slowly walk forward with the shield.Boom!An ogre\u2019s body was split into two even pieces. Some of the blood spurted onto the shield.Flick. Boom!The sound of the whip was followed by the explosion of a giant spider, and one of the legs flew over and hit the shield before falling to the ground.\u201cWatch and learn.\u201dCale walked through the battlefield in a straight line as he leisurely spoke, while On, Hong, and the Black Dragon all pretended not to care but were seriously watching the battle.The monsters that appeared in front of Cale who seemed to be on a stroll through the forest all disappeared thanks to Witira. Cale stopped once he could see the swamp in the distance before starting to speak.\u201cThis is now the start of the swamp region.\u201dBoom. Boom.The mutant troll\u2019s head fell to the ground before it was followed by its body. Witira flicked off the fluids on the whip as she responded.\u201cLet us keep moving.\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dPaseton let out a sigh as he followed his sister to Cale\u2019s side. The Whale siblings suddenly stopped walking and tightly pressed their masks. It was because poison and a rotting smell entered their nose.At the same time, their eyes opened wide after seeing the swamp that was covered by large trees until now.\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it fitting for the Forest of Darkness?\u201dCale turned away from the shocked Paseton and looked toward the swamp.The swamp was as wide as a lake and pitch black.He spoke to the rest.\u201cIt is a pretty large lake. It is large enough for multiple huge ships to fit. It is also unique compared to other swamps because this swamp is black.\u201dIt was the most fitting spot to explain the reason for the name of the Forest of Darkness.This swamp was the only actual black spot in the forest.\u201c...I didn\u2019t expect it to be so big.\u201dWitira let out her admiration. She then took a gulp after looking at the swamp area. Cale understood why she would have such a reaction.All of the plants were either black or brown, yet they were not dying, and instead they were extremely vibrant.\u201cIt must be poison.\u201dCale nodded in response and tightened the mask on his face. He also tightened the laces on his shoes and put on some gloves.The rest of the party followed suit.They could hear Cale\u2019s voice coming through the mask.\u201cThe plants here have grown up with in the poison and have mutated to survive in the environment. Although it might not be a deadly poison, they all have some type of poison within them. Be careful and make sure the plants do not touch your skin.\u201dThat made Paseton think about the mermaids\u2019 poison and quickly, make sure he was completely covered. He then felt that something was odd.\u201c...Hong?\u201dThe red kitten strolled past him. Hong looked toward Cale and dashed into the swamp region after seeing Cale nod. Witira tried to reach out and grab him, but it was too late.\u201cHong!\u201dHong did not have a mask nor anything on him. Witira looked toward Cale with shock, but Cale did not seem to be fazed. Witira then heard Hong\u2019s voice.\u201cDelicious!\u201dHong was wagging his tail and chewing on a black plant. Cale stepped into the swamp region as well and approached Hong.\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a paralyzing poison, but it is tangy!\u201dCale sternly commented to the excited Hong.\u201cSlow down, you might choke. Eat slowly, but eat a lot.\u201d\u201cOkay. I feel like I am getting stronger.\u201dCale snarkily commented to the Whale siblings, who were still blankly standing outside the swamp region.\u201cAre you not coming?\u201dThe Whale siblings slowly entered the swamp with chaotic expressions on their faces. Cale slowly led them closer to the swamp. Thankfully, the brown ground and black swamp were easy to differentiate from each other, so there was basically no danger of falling into the swamp lake.That was why Cale was able to quickly inspect his surroundings.\u201cPaseton.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPaseton was standing there with a stiff expression on his face, acting as if that blank expression from earlier had never existed. Cale pointed to a location nearby.\u201cLooks like someone was here recently, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dThere were some marks on the ground and lots of footprints. Since the monsters did not come to this area, there was only one explanation.\u201cI will investigate it.\u201dPaseton immediately went to investigate and Cale turned away from him.The ingredient from the swamp that made the mermaids stronger. The evidence they left behind gave Cale a good idea of what it might be.\u201c...Looks like there is a good chance it was the swamp itself.\u201dThere were many marks on the ground next to the swamp. They probably didn\u2019t care about hiding their tracks, since they believed that nobody would come here.Tap tap.Cale stopped looking at the swamp and looked down after feeling a tap on his leg.Hong seemed to be really excited, as his mouth was covered in black and he was rubbing on Cale like he was trying to be cute.\u201cI want to try drinking the swamp too.\u201dWitira, who was next to them, flinched, but Cale did not care as he responded to Hong.\u201cWait for now.\u201dHong\u2019s ears fell.\u201c...But I want to get even stronger.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHong peeked toward the Black Dragon and his sister, On. A large hand patted Hong\u2019s head at that moment.\u201cDon\u2019t think about useless things and take it slow. You\u2019re already stronger than I am.\u201d\u201cBut everyone is stronger than you are.\u201dCale lightly patted Hong\u2019s head and told Hong to go over there and eat some other poisons.Cale thought about how he would make On and Hong stronger in the future before turning away. However, that made him immediately start to frown.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019The Black Dragon seemed to be acting odd, as he continuously tilted his head to the left and right.At that moment, Paseton approached.\u201cThere are no signs of digging up any of the nearby plants recently. However, there are many signs that they are doing something to the swamp itself. Based on the marks, I would say they were here between two weeks to a month ago.\u201dCale looked toward the wide swamp and responded.\u201cIt looks like they gathered up some of the swamp.\u201d\u201cThat does seem to be the case.\u201dCale was about to speak after seeing Paseton and Witira looking serious. However, the Black Dragon approached at that time and Cale started to frown.\u201cWhy did you take the mask off?\u201d\u201cIt was not a familiar scent, but a familiar scent of mana.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019Cale started to get the chills. The Black Dragon pointed to the swamp with his short front paw.\u201cThere is a familiar scent of mana here.\u201dCale started to frown even more. The Black Dragon confidently added on.\u201cThere is the scent of dragon mana in the swamp.\u201dCale urgently looked toward the black swamp. This extremely vast swamp was massive, but Cale was thinking about the size of an adult or ancient dragon.\u201cOf course, there is no sign of life in the mana. It is just a very weak trace.\u201dThese words were the final blow. The unbelievable thought in Cale\u2019s head quickly became the reality. He then also felt like he knew how the mermaids got stronger.There was a dragon corpse inside the swamp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That symbolized a power that existed in nature.In some senses, it was similar to an ancient power that was created in a specific location. However, the two were very different.The difference was between whether or not it could be left behind.Mana disappeared as soon as the person who controlled that mana died, while ancient powers could be left behind.The Black Dragon easily answered.\u201cI think it is because of the swamp. The swamp is dominating the mana and preventing it from dissipating.\u201d\u2018Dominating?\u2019Cale\u2019s expression turned odd but the Black Dragon kept silent. The Whale siblings, as well as On and Hong, approached Cale and the Black Dragon.The Black Dragon started to speak into Cale\u2019s mind.- I am very perceptive.Cale made eye contact with the Black Dragon.- I feel a power similar to your shield and wind inside the swamp.\u201cHa!\u201dCale inadvertently let out a gasp-like laughter. The mask-less Black Dragon started to smile. Cale also started to lightly smile as well.Ancient power.There was an ancient power inside the swamp and it had a good chance of being related to the keyword, \u2018dominate.\u2019\u2018This is a first.\u2019This was Cale\u2019s first time finding an ancient power that was not discussed in the novel. Of course, he had no idea whether this was an ancient power left behind by someone or one that was naturally developed in this location.\u201cYou are very smart.\u201d\u201cCorrect. I am smart.\u201dThe rest of the group became even more curious after seeing the Black Dragon and Cale smirking mischievously.\u201cYoung master Cale, can you tell me what is going on? What do you mean by the scent of a dragon\u2019s mana?\u201dCale turned around to look at Witira. She was asking Cale, but seemed to have at least a decent idea of what was going on.\u201cI\u2019m sure you already have an idea, but there is a good chance that there is a dragon corpse inside the swamp.\u201d\u201c...A corpse?\u201d\u201cYes. But it is most likely very old and probably mummified.\u201dCale only knew about the Forest of Darkness based on Choi Han\u2019s experience as described in the novel. However, there was a number of very important information told by the novel.< The lifeforms in the Forest of Darkness have had to always fight for survival because there has never been any single dominant ruler. >No ruler.It was probably correct to say that there were no dragons in the Forest of Darkness while Choi Han was there. Furthermore, people in the novel never mentioned a Dragon\u2019s Lair or a dragon in the Forest of Darkness.\u2018It must mean that it is a very old corpse.\u2019Tap. Tap.Cale lowered his head to see Hong point to the swamp with a bitter expression.\u201cI guess I can\u2019t eat the swamp water?\u201dHong seemed to have lost his appetite after hearing dragon corpse. Cale could see that Hong was heading over to the Black Dragon to apologize without waiting to hear his answer.\u201cSorry. I thought it would be delicious.\u201d\u201cI do not care.\u201dThe Black Dragon responded back with a curious expression.\u201cThe thing inside the swamp and I are different. We are not related.\u201dDragons really didn\u2019t seem to care about their, \u2018tribe.\u2019 They all just considered themselves to be individuals unique from anything and everything else in the world. Cale looked at the completely unperturbed Black Dragon before he started to speak.\u201cI thought that the mermaids would have gotten stronger from the poison in the swamp. Their specialties are poison after all.\u201dThe Whale siblings Paseton and Witira looked toward him.\u201cHowever, now I am thinking that it is probably the dead mana in the swamp and not the poison increasing their power. Either that, or it is from both the poison and the dead mana.\u201dCale looked at the siblings.\u2018If it is poison, they would just need to take a sample to find an antidote. However, this is a whole different ball game if it is from the dragon\u2019s dead mana.\u2019Cale could see Witira frowning while Paseton was looking at the black swamp and the nearby area. A depressed comment came out of his mouth.\u201c...It\u2019s too wide.\u201dWitira spoke up as well.\u201cI am not sure about what we should do.\u201dThey were able to narrow down the cause of the mermaids\u2019 source of strength, but they could not figure out a way to deal with it. It would be one thing if it was poison, but the other issue was too complicated to solve quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we could prevent anyone from coming into the Forest of Darkness or stay here protecting this black swamp at all times.\u201dWitira looked out toward the swamp once more. A dragon\u2019s corpse? That was an unexpected problem. The fact that this swamp was large enough to completely submerge an adult dragon made things even more difficult.A normal dragon grows in size a total of three times. An adult dragon that completed all three stages of growth was humongous. They were at least 5 meters larger than a Humpback Whale like herself.At that moment, he could hear Cale\u2019s voice once again.\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201dHis voice was peaceful. Witira turned her head. Cale had walked up to the edge of the swamp while smiling.\u201cFirst, take as much of the swamp water as you need.\u201dCale turned away from the swamp and looked toward Witira.\u201cAnd then we make another deal.\u201d\u201c...Deal?\u201dCale\u2019s smile became bigger after watching the confusion spread on Witira\u2019s face.\u2018I didn\u2019t plan on doing this, but\u2026\u2019Originally, he was just going to figure out what caused the mermaids to get stronger before getting out of here. However, the situation was different now.\u2018A pool of dead mana is dangerous.\u2019The mermaids were probably able to absorb the dead mana because they were dark creatures. However, it was just a dangerous poison to natural creatures like the Whales or humans.There was no reason to keep something around that was helpful to the enemy while dangerous to himself.There was also a new benefit in front of his eyes.Even if it was a mummified corpse, the dragon\u2019s bones were still present. [1]Furthermore, there was also the ancient power.\u201cYes. We will make another deal.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with dealing with this situation?\u201dWitira subconsciously caressed her whip again. An unexpected sense of anticipation filled her heart, and Cale fulfilled that anticipation completely.\u201cI will take care of it for you.\u201dWitira could see the excitement in Cale\u2019s eyes. She had never seen such a look in Cale\u2019s eyes before.Cale pointed to the swamp and gave a short answer.\u201cI\u2019ll just destroy it.\u201d\u201c...What?\u201dWitira looked at the black swamp. The very large black swamp. What did he say he was going to do to this? She was staring blankly at the swamp when Cale started to speak again.\u201cNo need to overthink it.\u201dShe looked back at Cale. He still had a smile on his face and seemed to be very excited.\u201cI will get rid of it for you, so make a deal with me.\u201dCale was thinking about what he was about to do.This was the Forest of Darkness, somewhere where nothing would seem weird. It was a place where he could claim anything that happened to be an accident and feign ignorance.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dIt was a deal that Witira could not reject.\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201dCale and Witira decided to make a second deal.\u201cBut there isn\u2019t anything I need right now.\u201d\u201cPlease let me know whenever a condition you like shows up. I will accept it as long as it is something reasonable for both parties. This is a promise I, WItira, makes with my name on the line, so you do not need to worry.\u201dCale casually nodded his head at her words. It was fine if she did not do anything for him. The Dragon\u2019s bones and ancient powers were enough of a reason to give it a try.\u201cBy the way, anything coming out of the swamp belongs to me.\u201d\u201c...Sure.\u201dWitira was disappointed about the dragon\u2019s bones, but decided not to be greedy. The Whale tribe was able to rule because they were strong on both land and sea.However, water was also their weakness. Underwater, inside of the swamp. If the swamp water and mud was poisonous, it would be a difficult environment for the Whales to survive.Cale decided to proceed right away after hearing Witira\u2019s response. He stood at the border of the swamp and waved toward the rest of the group.\u201cStep back.\u201dThe rest of the group became confused. However, Cale just sternly said it once more for these chumps that won\u2019t listen to him when he wanted to get to work right away.\u201cGo back into the forest and stay there. Don\u2019t come out until I tell you to come out.\u201dCale opened up the magic bag and continued to speak.\u201cYou could get poisoned or hurt if you don\u2019t listen.\u201dPaseton, who had been listening quietly, started to speak.\u201cYoung master-nim, will you do it on your own?\u201d\u201cHe is not alone.\u201dThe Black Dragon responded for Cale. Paseton turned toward the sound of the voice and then flinched. He could see the clear vibrations of mana around the Black Dragon. They were like waves floating around the Black Dragon, who had found the perfect opportunity to show off his strength.\u201cThe two of us will take care of it, so go wait over there.\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, I really can\u2019t tell what your limits are.\u201dCale just let Witira\u2019s comment go in one ear and out the other ear, as he patted On and Hong on the head. Hong\u2019s ears and tails were down.\u201cYou two stay there as well. On, take good care of Hong. Hong, I\u2019ll bring you some of the swamp poison, so just wait for me.\u201dHong nodded his head at Cale before approaching the Black Dragon.\u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe Black Dragon nodded his head at Hong and stood still while Hong patted him with his front paws. Cale thought that the kids were playing well with each other and took an empty bottle out of the magic bag and threw it toward Paseton.\u201cPut the swamp water into the bottle. It is a magic bottle, so it won\u2019t break.\u201d\u201c...How did you even prepare for this?\u201dPaseton looked toward Cale with admiration, but Cale did not care. Instead, he continued to ruffle through the magic bag that looked small on the outside but was very spacious on the inside.\u201cYoung master-nim, I filled the bottle.\u201d\u201cThen go wait over there.\u201dCale told Paseton, who had filled the large bottle with mud and water from the swamp, and the rest of the group to move along. Witira hesitated for a moment, but moved back toward the forest at the kittens\u2019 urgings.The Black Dragon verified that everyone was safely far away before approaching Cale.\u201cWhat do you plan to -.\u201dThe Black Dragon stopped talking after seeing what Cale took out of the magic bag. He then continued speaking after seeing Cale gently smiling at him.\u201cHuman, you look a bit smart right now.\u201d\u201cNah.\u201dThere were two magic bombs in Cale\u2019s hands.These were different from the bombs with the multiple explosions he used in the Ubarr coast. These were the stronger and more destructive bombs used in the novel when the Ubarr mages launched their final attack.Two of those bombs were in Cale\u2019s hands right now.\u201cI was debating where to use these, but I guess an opportunity has shown up.\u201dCale handed the two magic bombs to the Black Dragon.\u201cRun wild.\u201d\u201cCan I really do that?\u201dCale shortly answered the Black Dragon, who had caused a very visible fluctuation of mana to show how much he wanted to use his full strength.\u201cDon\u2019t ask something so obvious. Naturally, make sure I don\u2019t get hurt.\u201dThe Black Dragon started to smile.Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish.A gust of wind started to run amuk with the Black Dragon at the center. Natural power. The mana was triggering the air in the vicinity.Cale quickly summoned the Indestructible Shield after feeling like he was going to be pushed back.At the same time, he could see layers of shields being created around him.One layer, two layers, three layers.It was a total of three layers.\u201cI need at least this much to make sure you don\u2019t get hurt.\u201dThe confidently speaking Black Dragon\u2019s eyes were sparkling. Dragons really had completely different personalities compared to Whales. Rather than loving peace, dragons prefered to rule with fear and destruction. They were selfish and violent beings.Cale pointed toward the black swamp once the Black Dragon had finished preparations for the bombs and looked toward him.\u201cDestroy it.\"1.

Cale turned around to look at the boundary of the Black Swamp and the forest region. Since that violent and ominous aura was controlling the boundary, the forest was not shaking.However, the group waiting for them there all had pale expression.Cale recalled the information about the dragon\u2019s strength in \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019< The reason the Whale Tribe was said to be able to survive against a dragon was literally because they would manage to survive without dying. There was nothing the dragon could not kill if it really wanted to do so. You just needed to look at a Dragon\u2019s strength to see why they called themselves above all else. >Booom! Boom! Booooom!Cale turned his gaze back up to the sky. Multiple strands of mana were crashing against each other as they gathered around the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon looked down at the swamp with calm.A 4-year-old dragon that used to get tortured.That same dragon could no longer be found.< A dragon does not need to dominate things because its existence itself is a symbol of dominance. >Cale started to feel chills down his back.Ooooooooo-Psssssssssh-Caaawwwwwww-!Squeeeeeeeeak-!The Forest of darkness started to cry. Cale looked around and did not see any other existence. However, there were many different sounds of screaming coming from the forest.The monsters that had not feared the Black Dragon earlier were all so scared that they were screeching at the top of their lungs.So loud.Cale looked toward the Black Dragon after hearing it speak in his mind. The Black Dragon was looking down at Cale as well. The two magic bombs were already floating in the air.There was just emptiness in the Black Dragon\u2019s eyes. All of this was just trivial to him.\u201cHa!\u201dThe corners of Cale\u2019s lips slowly went farther and farther up. The Whale Tribe\u2019s Witira? An overwhelming dominance that was worlds apart from the large humpback whale was coming from the Black Dragon\u2019s tiny body right ow.Cale answered in a loud voice.\u201cDO it fast because it's loud for me too!\u201dI knew you would say that.The Black Dragon finally started to smile as his unique black mana started to surround him.Oooooong.Now the ground was fluctuating. Cale could feel the vibration underneath his feet.\u2018Amazing.\u2019However, he didn\u2019t have time to keep looking at the vibrating ground.The black mana had disappeared. In its place was a large bright orb above the black swamp.Crackle, crackle.The orb was like the sun, gathering all different sources of light as they crashed against each other like serpents.Cale gulped. It was at that moment.Swiiiiiiiiiiish-The wind started to roar as the Black Dragon\u2019s black mana entered the two magic bombsClick. Click.The two bombs started their countdowns.Two bombs that were made to be as explosive as possible along with an orb that looked like a giant meteor.\u2018Rather than destroying it, it is going to obliterate it.\u2019Cale wondered whether the dragon corpse would be okay but could not actually ask about it.I\u2019m doing it now.Cale could not see anything else after the Black Dragon said that.Baaaaaaaaang!Cale covered his ears as the Forest of Darkness echoed.\u201cUgh.\u201dCale stumbled from the ground\u2019s vibration but did not close his eyes.The world turned black.A black fluid shot up to the sky as an extremely bright light shine in Cale\u2019s eyes.Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeech-A chilling noise rang in Cale\u2019s ear.The light started to crack as it made contact with the black fluid. Cale raised his head.A black pillar shot up into the sky making it look like night and day coexisted together. However, all of that quickly disappeared. The black pillar turned into dust and blew away with the wind.Crackle.The final shield broke down. The other two had already broken down earlier without any noise. Cale was not hurt.The black swamp disappeared but everything else remained normal.Cale turned his head to see that Paseton had fallen on his butt with the kittens in his arms. He could also see Witira getting back up while holding onto a tree trunk.There was deep fear in both of their eyes.But the forest was not harmed. Only the swamp had disappeared. It was an amazing degree of control. That was why the Whale tribes could not get rid of the fear in their eyes.Cale turned back around to see that the black pillar had disappeared, and the Black Dragon was standing alone. The Black Dragon was already looking at Cale as well.Cale spoke to the tiny dragon.\u201cGood work.\u201dAl five of the dragon\u2019s senses were very alert right now. He could see that Cale, who was smiling at him, had goosebumps on his arm. He could also see Cale\u2019s gaze as well.\u201cYou did really well.\u201dCale\u2019s calm gaze made the Black Dragon start to smile. He then honestly shared his feelings.\u201cSo refreshing.\u201dThat made Cale go stoic. Seeing the dragon really looking refreshed made Cale make up his mind to never make the dragon angry.Ron, Choi Han, and Beacrox were also the concern. There were too many strong beings to be happy that he was able to defeat a couple small monsters.Cale reaffirmed his desire to live a peaceful life after feeling the existence that is a dragon. He then looked at the bottom of the swamp that was now visible.The black swamp was there but there was still a bit of black liquid remaining.\u201cIt is in the shape of a dragon.\u201dThere was a block of black mud, looking like a clay dragon, remaining in the size of an adult dragon. He also found a white crown by where it seemed like the dragon\u2019s head would have been.It was the ancient power\u201cCan I do as I please?\u201dThe Black Dragon responded to him.\u201cDon\u2019t ask such obvious questions.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dCale did not notice the Black Dragon flinching as he headed to the dragon shaped black mud. He would probably find the dragon\u2019s bones if he got rid of this mud.\u2018If I get this and the magic tower\u2026\u2019What a jackpot.Cale started to smile and his palm started to itch with excitement.Paaat!The shield appeared in front of Cale and a whirlwind started to roar in each of his hands. The whirlwinds were as large as possible and wind started to form underneath Cale\u2019s feet as well.Swooooooooooooosh.It was the moment the Sound of the Wind gathered together.Spuuuuurt!The black mud shot quickly toward Cale like it wanted to swallow him.It was at that moment that Cale heard the voice of the ancient power\u2019s owner. This was also not a location-based ancient power but one left behind by someone.Do you know what it means to dominate?Boom. Boom. Boom.The cold voice that seemed to pierce through his skin made Cale\u2019s heart run wild.And then Cale\u2019s body suddenly shot forward.Bang! Bang!The whirlwinds in his hands shot out like arrows. The whirlwinds cut through the black mud to create a path.Cale quickly walked through that path.The shield and the wings prevented the black mud from landing on Cale.Dominating is to take away everything, even the enemy\u2019s breathingBoom. Boom. His heart beat madly every time he heard the voice.It was like fear\u201cUgh.\u201dCale bit down on his lips at his heart\u2019s wild beating.Swooooooosh-The whirlwind arrows cut through the black mud again. Cale continued to hear the owner of the ancient power\u2019s dominating voice in his mind.Do you know what the easiest way to take away your enemy\u2019s breath is?Swiiiiiiish, swiiiiiish.Whirlwinds continued to pour out of Cale\u2019s hands to clear the way for him. Cale was surrounded by the black mud, making him covered in darkness.However, Cale had to continue to walk down the path created by the whirlwinds.He then heard the voice again.Fear is the answer.Cale started to smile. Fear?Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo, had overcome all sorts of fears.He needed to do so because he wanted to live. He wanted to live a happier and more peaceful life than anyone else.Humans already lived a life full of dread and fear about the mysterious future.A combined whirlwind that was bigger than the others shot out of Cale\u2019s hand to continue to create a path.Roooooooooar!It was much stronger than before.\u201cBullshit.\u201dDomination? Fear? Cale didn\u2019t care about that. All he cared about was how it would benefit him.Cale quickly walked through the path he created. He then heard the voice again.Muhahaha. You are right. It is bullshit. You already know.\u2018Found it.\u2019Cale could see the White Dragon\u2019s skull as well as the white crown on its head.Cale reached out toward the crown and his fingertips touched the tip of jewel on the crown.Use it well!A bright light shot out of the crown and made the black mud disappear. At the same time, the crown flew toward Cale. He closed his eyes to hear a different and refreshing voice.Sometimes, even bluffing can save your life. Muhahaahhahaha!Cale could feel another power wrapping around his heart.Boom, boom.His heart was beating wildly. He could immediately tell what this power was.Cale\u2019s expression turned iffy\u201c\u2026What the hell is this?\u201dCale opened his eyes. He saw that all of the black mud disappeared and the large dragon\u2019s corpse revealed itself.\u201cHuman, why do you seem as strong as the tip of my claw? No, you are still weak, so what is going on?\u201dThe Black Dragon rushed over to Cale. He seemed to be quite confused. Cale started to smile.\u201cMy charisma has increased.\u201d\u201cWhat useless crap are you saying now, human?\u201dThe Black Dragon looked anxious, but it was the truth.Cale was able to learn the name of this ancient power.\u2018Dominating aura\u2019It was a really cheesy name but that was exactly what it was.\u2018ONLY\u2019 your aura becomes stronger.It was a pretty useless power compared to the decorated crown shape it came in.\u201cIt is a perfect power for scamming.\u201d\u201cScamming is bad.\u201dCale ignored the Black Dragon that started to frown and nag at him and looked toward the rest of their group.He could see that they were hesitating and could not approach him. Cale put away the dominating aura and motioned to the group standing far away.Currently, the entire forest was quiet as if they never screeched in the first place. Cale was the one to break that silence.\u201cCome over here.\u201dThe deep voice made the kittens who were covering their ears and face abruptly turn their heads. They were then able to approach Cale and the Black Dragon very quickly. However, they rushed past Cale.They were heading to the Black Dragon. However, they slowed down once they got near the dragon.\u201cH, he doesn\u2019t look hurt!\u201d\u201cWe were so scared! Our youngest cannot get hurt!\u201dThe kittens roamed around the dragon and made sure he wasn\u2019t hurt. They then approached him and patted the dragon\u2019s back.\u201cOur youngest is the best!\u201d\u201cSo cool! You are so strong!\u201dCale made sure the dragon calmly stayed with the kittens before looking toward the Whale siblings who still had not moved. Cale had a smile on his face as he patted the dragon who approached him and asked the Whale siblings.\u201cYou can\u2019t come?\u201dThe deep voice echoed in the Whale siblings\u2019 ears. Witira opened up the fists she had been clenching. It wasn\u2019t like that right now, but the moment the black mud disappeared, Cale looked very different. He definitely was still a weak human who would die with a single flick of her whip.\u2018It was different than a strong power.\u2019It was only for a moment, but Cale reminded her of her father, the Whale King. It was not based on his strength.But it was an atmosphere that only those in power could have. That was what she felt.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dCale asked the Whale siblings who finally approached him.\u201cI\u2019m guessing the two of you aren\u2019t hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026We are not.\u201dWitira did not say anything after seeing that Cale was back to his usual self. Cale looked away from the Whale siblings and back to the Black Dragon.\u201cAny stagnant mana left?\u201d\u201cNot anymore.\u201dSince the black liquids and mud disappeared, the stagnant mana no longer remained. All that was left was the sturdy dragon bones that had a high magic resistance and magic capabilities.\u201cThen you can store these bones.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dCale looked down toward the kittens who were rubbing their faces on his calf. Once they made eye contact with Cale, both kittens started to tap Cale\u2019s feet with their paws.\u201cWe thought something bad would happen. Why do you always step forward when you are the weakest?\u201d\u201cYou just have to leave it to our youngest sibling. But he can\u2019t get hurt either.\u201dCale ignored the kittens who were scolding him. He then continued to speak to the group.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dThey had to return to the Henituse estate now.And a few days later, Cale was able to return home two days later than expected. Hans had a message for him as soon as he returned.\u201cYoung master-nim! His highness, the crown prince, contacted you. What is going on?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dCale vaguely answered Hans. However, he couldn't hide the smirk on his face.\u201cSomething that is mutually beneficial.\u201dIt was a great chance to steal the biggest treasure created by the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s Civil War. Hans also delivered another piece of information to Cale.\u201cAh, and Choi Han-nim sent a message that he will be heading back from the Breck Kingdom.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019\u201cLittle Lock is coming back with him as well. Oh, and even Miss Rosalyn.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2018This soon? Did they just destroy the Breck Kingdom?\u2019Cale started to frown as soon as he returned home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard that the Vice Captain and the children will remain in Harris Village to work.\u201dCale started to frown at Hans\u2019s endless barrage of questions. Hans did not care, as he continued on while picking On and Hong up into his arms.\u201cYou said the Vice Captain was staying back to investigate the Forest of Darkness?\u201dThe explosion in the Forest of Darkness. The Vice Captain knew of the cause of the explosion because Cale explained it to him, but the \u201cofficial\u201d story was that he was staying back to investigate because they were keeping Cale\u2019s involvement a secret.\u2018Young master-nim, I will take care of these tiny roles for now, but I will not remain in this spot forever.\u2019Cale quickly got rid of Hilsman\u2019s comment to him from his mind. It was useless chatter anyways.\u201cI didn\u2019t need them anymore, so I let them go at the entrance.\u201dThe Whale siblings had left at the entrance. They naturally had the bottle of swamp water with them. However, half of its contents were with Cale.Hong\u2019s tail was shaking because he was going to get stronger soon. On as well.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cDid the crown prince say when I should contact him?\u201dCale leisurely asked. However, Hans answered back sternly.\u201cImmediately. That was what he said.\u201dCale started to smile. The crown prince must have been really anxious. Cale calmly started to speak.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d***Cale sat down on the couch and crossed his legs. The territory\u2019s video communication mage peeked toward Cale.\u201cIs it ready?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes!\u201dThe mage gulped before continuing on.\u201cIt is possible to speak with his highness right now.\u201dThe mage was looking at Cale, the person the crown prince was currently looking for. Compared to how nervous he was, Cale seemed to be very calm.\u201cThen you can head out now.\u201dThe mage quickly bowed and left, although he turned around a few times on his way out due to curiosity. Cale commenced the video communication as soon as the mage left, and a face soon appeared on top of the half transparent orb.Cale immediately started to speak.\u201cIt is my great honor to speak with the star of the nation, the wonderf-\u201c- Enough.The crown prince immediately cut him off, as if Cale\u2019s words gave him the chills. Cale had a sly smirk as he quickly stopped talking.Alberu calmly observed Cale, who was sitting down leisurely, yet in a way that was still respectful, and then got straight to the point.- What a mess they made in the Breck Kingdom.Cale\u2019s smile became wider. It was what he had been waiting for. Why else would he have hurried over like this? It\u2019s not like he enjoying seeing the crown prince\u2019s face.\u2018The crown prince\u2019s information network is the most accurate.\u2019Cale quietly sat there and smiled as if nothing was wrong. Things would all take care of themself.- Seeing as how you are not saying anything, I guess you\u2019re already aware of what happened.See? All resolved without having to say anything.- Princess Rosalyn seems to have made her resolve. How else could she obliterate a Grand Duke\u2019s entire family in a single day?Cale felt his heart jump at the word, \u2018obliterate,\u2019 but he did not let it show on his face. It was because he could see that Alberu was observing him. Right now, Alberu was poking at Cale to see what he could find out.- She also gave up her claim to the throne.Rosalyn really did give up her claim to the throne. Now it was time for her to show her true nature as a mage.- But based on what I heard, there were two very strong individuals with her. Everybody else might not know but I do.The crown prince really was good at explaining things.Alberu\u2019s sharp gaze pointed toward Cale.- Aren\u2019t they your subordinates?Choi Han and Lock. Cale answered back with the truth to Alberu\u2019s question.\u201cMy subordinates?\u201dThey were not Cale\u2019s subordinates. Choi Han had nothing to do with him and Lock was just someone he was making a deal with. Cale could see the corner of the crown prince\u2019s lips slowly starting to move up. He also leaned back on the couch like Cale and casually spit it out.- You sly fox.Cae could not disagree with that. Alberu saw Cale\u2019s lack of reaction and shook his head before adding on.- Why do you want the Magic Tower?The crown prince no longer tried to beat around the bush or be glib around Cale. Cale looked toward the crown prince with a serious expression.\u201cYour highness.\u201dCale sat up from his seat, which made the crown prince also sit up with curiosity. Cale then continued.\u201cEvery so often, I have this thought that you and I are very similar.\u201dThe crown prince started to frown.- Such a terrible thought.\u201cI agree.\u201dCale just pushed aside the fact that the crown prince showed such disdain for the fact that the two of them may be similar and continued on.\u201cThe Roan Kingdom is a kingdom without anything.\u201dSilence suddenly filled the room. If the mage outside the room heard what Cale just said, he may have fainted. However, the crown prince Alberu was smiling as Cale had expected.The crown prince seemed to have latched onto the bait.- Not going to watch what you say now?\u201cYour highness, you are currently smiling, aren\u2019t you?\u201d- Well, it is the truth.The crown prince did not disagree.The Roan Kingdom was a kingdom where neither the knights nor the mages were very strong. Although it had a long history, it was just average in every aspect.However, crown prince Alberu knew that, although this would be fine during times of peace, it was not okay to be mediocre in every aspect during times of chaos. He knew that they needed at least one specialty area.However, that was not something that could easily be created in a short period of time.Such a large scale issue would take tens of years if they were lucky, but at least an average of hundreds of years if they were not. That was why he had made up his mind.Take it from someone else.Take another kingdom\u2019s specialty away and make it theirs.And a good prey appeared in front of his eyes.The Whipper Kingdom that used to be the kingdom of mages.Cale and Alberu made eye contact as Alberu commented.- You sharp bastard.The two of them had similar smirks on their faces. This time, it was Cale\u2019s turn to speak.\u201cThe Magic Tower for me. And for you, your highness-\u201cCale and Alberu answered at the same time.\u201cMages.\u201d- Mages.A short silence filled the room before Alberu covered his eyes with his hand and started to laugh.- Haha. Interesting. At first, I thought it was terrible that there was someone else like me.The crown prince laughed for a while before removing his hand and answering.- I will give you whatever you need.Alberu then waited for Cale\u2019s response.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dJust that sentence and nothing else. However, that sentence struck Alberu properly. Alberu was curious about this confident attitude of Cale\u2019s and asked.- But why is it that you want the Magic Tower?Cale noticed that the crown prince seemed to be observing him again. He really was a difficult person to handle, but there was no reason to be so worried.I\u2019m sure he wants to know if I know about the North\u201dThere was an existence that was a source of concern for the Roan Kingdom in the novel, the Northern Kingdom of Knights. Crown prince Alberu was wary of that kingdom while preparing for their invasion.War is a time of chaos, and chaos will provide opportunities for the prepared. One of those opportunities was the mages running away from the Whipper Kingdom.The crown prince, who didn\u2019t have much influence in the kingdom, would use them to strengthen his power and increase his influence inside the kingdom.If Kim Rok Soo had read past the fifth volume of, \u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 he would probably know the two powers that develop as new heroes. One would be a knight from the North.\u2018And the other would probably be the crown prince in front of him right now.\u2019Especially because the Black Dragon told him that the crown prince was not human. Cale started to smile. The crown prince was trying to figure out whether Cale knew about the North\u2019s movement and wanted the Magic Tower for that reason.\u201cI just want to own a Magic Tower.\u201d- .. I shouldn\u2019t have asked.Alberu could see the sly smirk on Cale\u2019s face as he shook his head.\u201cThen why is it that your highness needs the mages?\u201dAlberu started to smirk in a similar manner.- I just want to give them a home.Both answers were terrible excuses, but neither of them called each other out. The two people who were both sitting back casually like they were part of a painting just continued to chat with each other.- When do you plan to head out?\u201cI plan to go in about a month.\u201dOne month later. Cale would be finished with his preparations and head to the Whipper Kingdom at that moment. The Civil War would be close to ending by the time he arrived at the Whipper Kingdom. Toonka\u2019s stupid face seemed to be shining gold in Cale\u2019s mind.- How will you get there?\u201cBy ship.\u201d- And your guards?Guards. That word made Cale start to smile and Alberu realized his mistake.- I guess that was a useless question. Cale, make sure you are careful since your body is still weak. You know what to do, right?\u201cI will bring back any and all good things.\u201d- Sometimes we really are on the same page for no reason.Cale and Alberu, although the two of them were very different people, the smirks on their faces looked so similar right now.Three weeks later.Cale slowly opened his eyes and started to roll around. He rolled around his large bed and started to yawn.It was 3pm. He had just gotten up. He started to rub his eyes and looked up at the ceiling.\u201cI win! He woke up one hour later today!\u201d\u201cOur youngest wins again. \u00a0I really don\u2019t know why he keeps waking up later and later.\u201dThe Black Dragon and Hong looked back and forth between Cale and the clock while chatting with each other. Cale rubbed his belly with his right hand. He had only gotten up because he was hungry.\u201c...Ah, the life of a rich person who doesn\u2019t have to work.\u201dThis was the definition of happiness.Cale had not done anything for the past three weeks.He had come up with a name for the dragon, but asked for another month to think about it, and ordered other people to take care of all of the things he needed to prepare for the trip. He slept early and woke up late every day, just fooling and rolling around doing nothing inside the house. It was great that his family kept telling him to rest to recover. So he listened to them and did absolutely nothing.But Cale\u2019s happiness finally shattered.\u201cHuman, it looks like Choi Han is back.\u201dThe Black Dragon whispered in Cale\u2019s ear as he smiled.\u201cThis is great. I have been so bored lately.\u201dCale sat up on the bed with a stoic expression.Choi Han\u2019s group was supposed to arrive today. Since it was 3pm, they were probably already here and waiting for him.Cale stretched before getting up from the bed. These past three weeks of doing nothing resolved his mind even more.\u2018Make money so I can do nothing forever.\u2019Cale\u2019s eyes looked very determined. He decided that he would take care of the Whipper Kingdom and the Queen of the Jungle at once so that he could sit around doing nothing again. Cale headed into the bathroom while the Black Dragon approached Hong once he saw the door close.\u201cThe weak human\u2019s eyes only seem full of spirit whenever he is going somewhere.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. But I\u2019m glad that I am stronger now. I can make sure he does not get hurt.\u201dThe silver kitten On who had been listening to the Black Dragon\u2019s conversation with Hong had an odd expression on her face. She thought about the smile on Cale\u2019s face as he rolled around the bed and mumbled to herself.\u201cAre you sure it is full of spirit?\u201d\u201cYes. I am right.\u201d\u201cNoona, it definitely is.\u201d\u201cMm, I guess so.\u201dOn finally agreed and brushed her fur. On and Hong\u2019s furs were much brighter now. The three of them sat around waiting for Cale to come out. They were looking forward to heading out of the house again after such a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pushed back his still slightly damp red hair as he sat down and faced the three guests.He took a sip of the tea that deputy butler Hans had given him before he started to speak.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dCale looked toward Choi Han, whose expression did not change at all, and the just as shy Lock, and greeted them before looking toward Rosalyn.\u201cYour Highness, Princess Rosalyn, it has been quite a long time.\u201dRosalyn started to smile and answered in a refreshing manner.\u201cYou cannot call me princess anymore. I have been banished from the royal family.\u201d\u201c...Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I have been removed from the family records. I no longer have a family name.\u201dCale just turned away from Rosalyn, who answered in such a happy manner. He then casually added on.\u201cI guess I can just continue to call you Miss Rosalyn then.\u201dRosalyn\u2019s red pupils focused on Cale. Although she was the one who chose to give up her claims to the throne instead of getting written off, people still had looks of pity toward her these days. Seeing Cale acting so normally around her made her able to respond with a relaxed heart.\u201cYes. Just like before. You can keep treating me like that in the future too.\u201dShe could see Cale nodding without even looking at her and thought that she really did the right thing by choosing to come back with Choi Han.Cale did not see Rosalyn\u2019s smile, as he had turned to look at Choi Han and Lock. Choi Han was sitting straight up, but seemed to be quite happy.\u2018It feels like he became even more of a good guy.\u2019Choi Han\u2019s pupils were so clear that he seemed like a very good person. In fact, he seemed to have taken another step toward becoming a hero of justice. Cale turned away from that good guy vibe that did not mesh well with him and instead looked toward Lock.Lock was different from Choi Han. He seemed to have something to say, but was too shy to say it and thus could only sit there fidgeting his fingers.\u201cCale-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThere was no need for him to turn around. Choi Han was the only person who called him, \u2018Cale-nim.\u2019\u201cShould I report about what happened at Breck Kingdom?\u201dRosalyn suddenly looked toward Choi Han in shock. However, Choi Han did not look at her and only looked toward Cale.However, Cale, who was looking at Lock, shook his head.\u201cNo need. I don\u2019t think I need to know what you did for a friend.\u201dRosalyn could see Choi Han smiling peacefully after hearing Cale\u2019s words. He then started to speak.\u201cYes, that is true, but please let me know if there is anything you are curious about. I will report it to you right away.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dCale felt like he would just get a headache if he knew about it. He did not want to know how they were able to cause such a ruckus in the Breck Kingdom in such a short amount of time, as well as how Rosalyn gave up her claim to the throne.\u201cLock.\u201dHe called out to Lock instead.\u201cErr, yes?\u201dLock, who was now taller than Choi Han, was still a bit awkward. Cale knew why Lock was so fidgety right now.Hans had said that Choi Han\u2019s group had arrived an hour ago. While Choi Han and Rosalyn probably had a lot to do once they got here, it was obvious what Lock was thinking about in this foreign place.Cale looked toward Lock\u2019s confused face and started to speak.\u201cYour siblings are somewhere else right now.\u201dLock\u2019s expression changed.\u201cWhere? Are they all there?\u201dCale answered without any hesitation.\u201cHarris Village.\u201dChoi Han, who had been looking at Cale, stiffened after hearing those words. However, Cale did not even look his way before taking a break to take a sip of warm tea.Someone else interjected as he did that. It was deputy butler Hans.\u201cWe are currently reconstructing Harris Village. It used to be a small but beautiful village next to the mountain. Something bad happened not too long ago causing it to burn down.\u201dMountain, small but beautiful village, and reconstruction due to a large fire. A single image filled Lock\u2019s mind as he heard those words. It was an image of his hometown that was burned to the ground.\u201cWe are also constructing a proper cemetery as well.\u201dChoi Han looked toward Hans as Hans peeked toward Cale and continued to speak.\u201cThe young master was adamant about that part.\u201dClick.The teacup made a noise as Cale put it back down on the table. He then started to frown and retort back.\u201cI was not adamant about it.\u201d\u201cBut wasn\u2019t this the first thing you ever asked the Count-nim for in regards to something related to our Henituse territory? This was the first time I ever saw you interested in the administration of our territory, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing big.\u201dCale waved toward Hans to say nothing else and Hans quickly shut up. However, he seemed to be fidgety like he still had a lot to say. Cale just ignored this and looked toward Lock, who seemed to be deep in thought.\u201cLock.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cGo see your siblings and the land that they are living on right now.\u201dCale then turned around. Lock was staring at him, but he knew Lock would understand since he was a sharp kid. He then called out to the still stiff Choi Han.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dChoi Han was quietly observing Cale as usual. A lot of things had happened in the Breck Kingdom. He had taken care of all of it quickly in order to return home. He could hear Cale\u2019s voice echo in his ear.\u201cGo give your regards as well. Your younger brother Lock doesn\u2019t know the way, so you can guide him there.\u201dRegards. He didn\u2019t need to ask who that should be directed to. Choi Han lightly clenched his fists before opening them back up. He had to calm the overflowing emotions inside of him. Harris Village, that had burnt down to a crisp. That village would now be different.Cale said one final thing to the three of them.\u201cYou can go now. Miss Rosalyn, it is fine for you to leave now.\u201dCale was tired after dealing with these three for the first time in a while. It felt like his honey-like break for the last three weeks had just disappeared into thin air. Lock and Rosalyn slowly followed Hans out of Cale\u2019s study.Choi Han waited until they all had left before finally getting up.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dHe then bowed.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dChoi Han chuckled after raising his head back up because he could see Cale had a stoic expression that also seemed to show that he was annoyed.\u201cI don\u2019t need such thanks. Just get out.\u201dChoi Han did as he was told and headed for the door. Cale, who had picked his teacup back up while observing Choi Han, could hear Choi Han stop with the doorknob in his hand and start to speak.\u201cI heard from Mr. Hans that you will be heading to the Whipper Kingdom?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale just gave a curt response.\u201cWe will be going right away once you get back from the village, so pack your bags.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dChoi Han had a refreshing smile on his face. However, that smile quickly disappeared as he turned the doorknob.Click.Choi Han continued to speak as the door opened.\u201cHis name was Bob?\u201d\u201cHow do you know about Bob?\u201dIt had been a while since he heard of Toonka\u2019s alias, Bob.\u2018Did Hans tell him about Toonka?\u2019Cale looked toward Choi Han with curiosity, but he could only see Choi Han\u2019s back as he stood at the door. Choi Han\u2019s unique calm and sincere voice continued to flow.\u201cMr. Beacrox told me that he almost made you get hurt.\u201d\u2018Why would Beacrox say something like that?\u2019Cale recalled the incident and responded back.\u201cHurt? I didn\u2019t get hurt. I just got poured on by water and boulder dust.\u201d\u201c... I understand.\u201dChoi Han did not say anything else as he walked out of the study. Cale could see Hans crossing paths with Choi Han and coming back in. Hans stopped for a moment after making eye contact with Choi Han and blankly stood there.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing at all.\u201dHans waved his hands frantically at Cale\u2019s question and looked back toward the leaving Choi Han before coming into the study.\u201c... Young master-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCale observed Hans\u2019s completely pale expression.\u201cDid you have a fight with Choi Han-nim?\u201d\u201cMe? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t! Haha, it is nothing.\u201dCale stared at the weirdly acting Hans, but still said what he needed to say. He still had to give the order.\u201cWe will leave in about 10 days, so prepare everything.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. I will work hard!\u201dCale continued to blankly stare at the suddenly energetic Hans, but Hans quickly left the study. Cale, who was now left alone in the study, looked toward the calendar.The last guardian of the Magic Tower, who cast away his position and ran away.\u201c...This will be my first time seeing a dwarf.\u201dIn order to buy a fully intact Magic Tower, he needed to meet the dwarf whose family had protected the Magic Tower for generations. Cale started to smile.That dwarf was not just any dwarf.\u2018A mix-blood dwarf that is half Rat beast person.\u2019Muller. The tiny person that had the shabbiest and worst death in, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 He was as short as a dwarf and looked weak without any muscles due to the unique nature of the Rat people. He really was a tiny person.Cae headed out of the study and into the bedroom. He was thinking about how to catch that runaway Rat while he was heading toward the Black Dragon, On, and Hong, who were probably playing in the bedroom right now.10 days. This will pass by very quickly.***And just as Cale expected, a week quickly went by. He was sitting in his couch like he had been a week ago, leaning deep into the back of the couch.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale did not hide his sigh as he sat there with a frown.Choi Han and Lock, who had left exactly a week ago, leaving Rosalyn here, were back.However, they did not come back alone.\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201dVice Captain Hilsman came back with them. But his appearance was weird. The Vice Captain, who usually dressed in a way that fit his position, was wearing shabby leather armor and had lots of injuries on his face.\u2018I told him to focus on the restoration of Harris Village.\u2019It felt like the Vice Captain had done some things in addition to what Cale had ordered.\u201cI have returned, young master.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know the reason, but Cale still avoided Hilsman, who was speaking with admiration. However, he was not the only one who came back with Choi Han and Lock.\u201cYoung master-nim! We wanted to see you!\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale-nim! We\u2019re here too!\u201d\u201cHello young master Cale! Have you been well?\u201dCale could hear ten children speaking at once. Maes, as well as the other Wolf children, were innocently looking at Cale and smiling.However, the atmosphere around them felt very different. The children had bandages wrapped around multiple spots on their bodies. Something outside of Cale\u2019s expectations seemed to have happened in Harris Village.\u201cWe came with Lock hyung because you never mentioned when we should come back.\u201dMaes answered for all of them. Cale held back his sigh.\u2018Not telling you when to come was my way of saying don\u2019t come back.\u2019Cale could not tell the children who were already here to head back, so he just nodded his head and turned around to look at Choi Han and Lock. He gave an order to the two of them.\u201cPack your bags. We will leave in two days.\u201dHowever, a response came from somewhere else.\u201cYes sir!\u201dA total of 11 people. The Vice Captain and the Wolf children all energetically responded. It was like Cale was looking at a knights brigade that had been training for a long time. Choi Han and Lock looked toward them with satisfaction. This was especially true for Choi Han, who was looking at them like he was looking at his students.Cale\u2019s expression became odd.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All he said was one sentence.\u201cI will be visiting the Whipper Kingdom for a bit.\u201dClang.The spoon in the hand of his youngest sister, the 7-year-old Lily, fell to the ground. Cale turned to look at Lily after hearing the noise only to see Lily with a pale face and the corners of her lips shaking.\u201cMy teacher said.\u201dLily didn\u2019t even think about picking up the spoon as she continued to mumble.\u201cThe Whipper Kingdom is very scary right now and people die every day. The nobles have to hide and it is even hard to eat yummy food! You can\u2019t even sleep in peace! That is what my teacher said!\u201dHer emotions seemed to be getting stronger as she continued to speak. She then started to frown after looking toward Cale.\u201cYou are not allowed to do that.\u201dCount Deruth cut Lily off and sternly answered. Cale looked toward Deruth with confusion. The crown prince had promised assistance during his travel to the Whipper Kingdom so that he could safely and stealthily get there.\u2018We will tell your family that you are doing my bidding. There\u2019s no need to tell them about the mages or Magic Tower or anything of the sort, right?\u2019\u2018Of course. Secrets are the best. I also only want my family and the Ubarr territory liege to know of my travels.\u2019\u2018Naturally. I will have it all prepared.\u2019Crown prince Alberu then immediately informed Count Deruth that it was a secret mission that he had tasked for Cale.\u201cFather, it is an order from his highness, the crown prince.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThe good-natured and average looking Count Deruth\u2019s face was extremely scrunched up in a frown. Cale looked around to Basen, who was stiff like time had frozen, and then to the only person who looked calm, Violan.She casually asked once they made eye contact.\u201cIs this your own decision?\u201d\u201cYes. I wish to go.\u201d\u201cCale.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dViolan put her spoon down and continued to speak.\u201cYou know it is dangerous over there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale lightly agreed. However, it would be fine with Choi Han, the Black Dragon, Rosalyn, and Lock. Even Hilsman and the 10 Wolf Children were passionately asking him to take them with him, so he didn\u2019t think he would be in danger at all.\u201cCale, just remember one thing. I am always worried about you, my son. We all worry about you. However.\u201dViolan\u2019s gaze suddenly turned sharp.\u201cWe don\u2019t care about this kingdom at all.\u201d\u201cAhem, wife, we need the kingdom to be safe for our family to be safe as well.\u201dDeruth stopped frowning and let out a fake cough. However, Violan ignored it and continued to ask Cale.\u201cIs this your decision?\u201dViolan asked the same question once more and Cale immediately responded back.\u201cI am a Golden Turtle.\u201dCount Deruth recalled what he had said to his son not too long ago.\u2018We protect anything and everything with our very sturdy shell. However, the most important thing is to protect ourselves.\u2019He looked toward his son, who seemed calm and relaxed.\u201cIt is most important for me to use my sturdy shell to protect myself.\u201dThat was Cale\u2019s answer.\u201cI am a Henituse after all.\u201dOf course, Cale put his own safety first. He would only step into a battlefield if it looked like they would definitely win, and he had the strongest person on the battlefield next to him.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dHis voice was full of certainty and his gaze was confident. Countess Violan started to smile.\u201cAlright, I understand. But I do not think I can stop worrying. That is what it means to be a parent.\u201dThere really wasn\u2019t a reason to worry, but Cale nodded at Violan anyways. Count Deruth kept his mouth shut as they restarted their meal. Based on how he was not telling Cale that he could not go, it seemed like he had accepted it as well.\u201cThey think we\u2019ll do anything they order us to do because we have been staying low for a while.\u201dCount Deruth just mumbled to himself as he roughly chewed on a piece of a meat every so often. However, seeing as how there was no more opposition, Cale peacefully focused on his meal again.He was focusing on his meal intensely, such that he did not notice what happened next.He didn\u2019t see that the gaze shared between Count Deruth and Countess Violan was not normal. He also didn\u2019t know that after dinner, Count Deruth ordered the butler to secretly gather any and all information related to the crown prince and the Whipper Kingdom, regardless of the cost.Cale just finished the great meal and left the dining room. He could hear someone rushing toward him, although this was against the nobles\u2019 etiquette.\u201cBasen?\u201dIt was Basen and Lily who chased after Cale.\u201c\u2026Hyung-nim, must you go?\u201d\u201cPretty much.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to go, but he just preferred 10 years of peaceful days rather than just one day. Cale continued to speak to his two quiet siblings.\u201cBoth of you need to focus on your studies and training. I can only go around like this because the two of you are here holding things down.\u201dCale was always at peace knowing Basen would become the next liege of the territory and Lily the commanding officer for the military. At least they wouldn\u2019t have the typical drama plotlines of the eldest son and the more talented younger son fighting for the successor position nor something of the sort.Cale turned away from the siblings who were still just quietly watching him. He still had a lot to prepare. Cale started to walk away as he spoke to his siblings again.\u201cI will bring you both some souvenirs from the Whipper Kingdom.\u201dCale could not see that Basen and Lily\u2019s gazes were focused on Cale before exchanging glances with each other and nodding their heads. He had absolutely no idea that his younger siblings had already decided their future occupations.A few days later, Cale was happy that he was able to get on the ship at exactly the time he planned to do so.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dCale looked toward the source of the voice as soon as he got on the ship.\u201cYoung lady Amiru.\u201dAmiru quietly observed Cale, who was still just as relaxed as before. The Ubarr liege had already gotten on the same boat as the crown prince, so Amiru had ordered for them to prepare the largest and strongest ship as soon as she received the crown prince\u2019s order.\u00a0[1]\u201cYoung master Cale, I hope that you return safely without hurting yourself this time.\u201d\u201cI hope for the same as well.\u201dHe had absolutely no plans to get hurt. Cale could see that Amiru started to frown like she didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cI do not understand why his highness would send you to that dangerous place when you just finished your recovery. However, his highness is probably sending you because it is you, and he can trust you.\u201dTrust? The crown prince was not the type to trust anyone. Cale had no problem honestly saying that with a stiff expression.\u201cReally? I\u2019m not so sure. He didn\u2019t seem to trust me much at all.\u201dAmiru raised her voice at Cale\u2019s bitter smile.\u201cOf course! Young master Cale, if it means anything, I trust you.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, well, thank you very much young lady Amiru.\u201dSeeing Amiru respond so fiercely, which was opposite her calm demeanor, Cale could not say anything else. He then started to walk again as they needed to leave on time. He had people he needed to meet.\u201cYoung master Ca-.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be on my way now, young lady Amiru.\u201dAmiru had some other things to say, but just closed her mouth. The image of Cale pushing back his red hair that was moving along with the ocean breeze was both refreshing and cool.Cale got on the ship with a relaxed heart after seeing that Amiru was no longer trying to hold him back. He got on the deck and could see that the village was very noisy with construction right now.Furthermore, some of the other whirlpools had disappeared, creating a safe path that was wide enough for a large ship.\u2018But the rest of the whirlpools are still the same.\u2019Cale turned his gaze back to the ship and started to sigh.\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u201dHow did he end up with so many people?Choi Han, Lock, and Rosalyn.The kittens, On and Hong, were shaking because they were on water yet were adamant that they would come with him.Hans, who was next to the kittens.Finally, Vice Captain Hilsman, who was completely pale because he was on a ship, Beacrox, who was observing Hilsman silently, and the ten Wolf children next to him.\u2018If I get hurt with all of these freaks around me, that would be very surprising.\u2019Someone might even think he was trying to go destroy a kingdom right now.I like the smell of the ocean.Why would he fear anything, especially with the Black Dragon coming along as well?Cale gave an order to the group, who were all looking at him.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBoooooooooooooo-The horn sounded their departure across the Ubarr sea. The ship was disguised as a trade ship. Well, that wasn\u2019t really a disguise.\u2018It is a trade I am making after all.\u2019But it will naturally not be a fair trade. It would be very beneficial for Cale, but unfair for the other party.Human, do not smile like that. You look like you are going to scam someone again.He could hear the Black Dragon\u2019s voice, but chose to ignore it and enjoy the refreshing ocean breeze. Just like that, the ship started to head for the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s smallest port.Later that night.Cale was not sleeping but standing on the deck. It was close to midnight, so nobody else was on the deck, but the deck was lit up and the full moon made it not dark at all.He was planning to meet some guests here tonight.Cale leaned on one of the railings as he calmly looked out to the ocean. It was at that moment.\u201cHuman.\u201dThe Black Dragon revealed himself and approached Cale. There was no need to be invisible because nobody else was here right now.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI was just wondering\u2026\u201dThe Black Dragon seemed to have a lot on his mind. No, he seemed very suspicious as he blankly looked Cale up and down.\u201c\u2026Is the name you are thinking of a random word?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201dThe Black Dragon seemed very concerned.\u201cI feel like you will pick something like Black or Dragon.\u201d\u201cAh, your name?\u201dThe Black Dragon was talking about his name. Cale made a very serious expression at the 4-year old\u2019s very concerned question.\u201c\u2026Is a name like that not very good?\u201dCale\u2019s expression was very serious. The Black Dragon had not seen Cale look so serious for a while now. The Black Dragon\u2019s eyes started to shake as he urgently responded.\u201cNot at all! I am fine with anything! It is fine as long as you give me a name, human! Do not worry!\u201dHis wings were fluttering rapidly, and his tail was shaking as he strongly appealed to Cale. Cale\u2019s expression instantly turned normal like he was never serious at all.\u201cThen I am glad.\u201dHe then casually continued on.\u201cRaon, On and Hong would have been sad if they heard what you said.\u201dSilence suddenly filled the area.\u201c\u2026Human, what did you just say?\u201dCale had actually thought a lot about the Black Dragon\u2019s name, contrary to the Black Dragon\u2019s expectation. A name was a special thing given to someone. For Kim Rok Soo who had to live on his own, the only thing that was given to him by his parents was his name.\u201cYour first name is Raon.\u201dRaon. It meant joyful in pure Korean.\u00a0[2]\u201cAnd your last name is Miru.\u201dMiru. Pure Korean for Dragon.Joyful Dragon. It was a funny name, but Cale had come up with it with full sincerity. He was worried that Choi Han might be suspicious of a pure Korean name, but he had come up with an excuse for that as well.A calm voice reached the Black Dragon\u2019s ears. However, The Black Dragon had never seen such an expression on Cale\u2019s face before. A calm smile was on Cale\u2019s face right now.\u201cI came up with this name in the hopes that you will be happy and live a joyful life.\u201d\u201c\u2026What does it mean?\u201dThe Black Dragon asked Cale for the meaning of the name. Cale pointed to the Black Dragon with his index finger.\u201cYou.\u201dRaon and Miru. Neither of these words existed in this world. There was only one thing these two words stood for in this world.\u201cIt is you. They are words just for you and only you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Only me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale started to smile as he patted the Dragon\u2019s head.\u201cSince you are a great and mighty dragon.\u201d\u201c\u2026Only me \u2026\u2026\u201dThe Black Dragon mumbled to himself for a while before patting away Cale\u2019s hand from his head and stretched out his wings. His wings were fluttering rapidly as he snorted.\u201cI guess it is useful. I will do you a special service and use this name.\u201d\u201cSure, Raon.\u201dThe Dragon started to scrunch his nose. The corners of his lips were twitching as he flew up into the air.\u201cI am the great and mighty Raon Miru.\u201d\u201cYes, Raon.\u201d\u201cRight. I am Raon.\u201dThe Black Dragon had received a first name and a last name after four years of life. He now had something other than his body that belonged to just him. The Dragon raised his head.He could see the darkness of the night sky that was different from the darkness inside the cave. It was a night like this when he had been rescued from the cave. The Black Dragon, Raon, would never forget that moment. He also felt like he would never forget this moment either.Cale raised his head like the Black Dragon. The night sky was the same no matter where he went. He could hear Raon\u2019s voice as he blankly continued to stare at the sky.\u201cThank you, Cale.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dCale looked toward Raon with surprise. However, The Black Dragon was already back to normal.\u201cHuman, how is it that you cannot understand the first time?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it once more?\u201dCale started to smile as he tried to pat Raon\u2019s head. Raon headbutted the palm and strongly objected.\u201cNo. I really, truly, absolutely will not! Weak human, go inside and sleep! You will catch a cold.\u201dHowever, contrary to his actions, Raon\u2019s wings were fluttering and his tail was wagging like On and Hong. Cale quietly laughed at Raon\u2019s appearance. The quietly laughing Cale was very visible, even though it was night time and they were out in the ocean.\u201cI think it will be difficult to go back in.\u201d\u201cWhy is it diff-.\u201dRaon suddenly stopped talking before looking out into the ocean. He was looking at a spot far from the ship.Splaaaaaaaash-The water parted as a large existence slowly showed itself.It was a Whale.It was at that moment.\u201cCale-nim!\u201dSomeone urgently shot out from inside the ship and was rushing toward Cale at a very fast pace. It was Choi Han. Choi Han had a worried expression as he inspected the existence that was slowly revealing themselves. He then turned to look at Cale and approached him.\u201cHmm?\u201dIt was then that Choi Han could see it.Cale was waving at him to go away with a very annoyed expression. The Dragon Raon then scoffed at Choi Han and started to speak.\u201cThey are not enemies.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dChoi Han turned to look back at the ocean. At the same time, Cale stopped leaning on the railing and bowed his head toward the ocean.It was not just one Whale. There were three Whales coming to them.The guests had arrived.One was Witira, the Humpback Whale. The other was a Killer Whale. And finally.\u201cI greet the Whale King.\u201dCale greeted the largest of the three, a Humpback Whale, the Whale King.1. Being on the same boat is a metaphor for being on the same side.2. Apparently there are some words that are, \u2018pure,\u2019 Korean and not referencing Chinese at all. There are only so many of these words, but the author is choosing to use it for the Dragon\u2019s name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cale was smiling.\u2018What a strong pressure.\u2019Shickler was the king of the ocean. He had a presence that could not be compared to the king of a kingdom that oversaw a small region of the Western continent. That was why Cale was starting to smile even more.Shickler\u2019s pupils started to cloud as he began to smile. Cale stepped back a bit and opened up his arms.\u201cHow about we have our discussion above the deck?\u201dPsssssssssssh.Water vapor filled the air as three individuals quietly approached the ship.Tap. Tap. Tap.The three people gently landed on the deck. Cale could hear Raon\u2019s voice in his head at that time.- Dragons are much more beautiful and glorious!Cale understood Raon\u2019s feelings and patted his head. These three pure-blooded Whales were extremely beautiful.\u2018This one is completely stiff.\u2019Choi Han had stiffened up after seeing the Whale Tribe people.Cale followed Choi Han\u2019s gaze and looked at each of the three people in front of him. The future Whale Queen, Witira. She was the same as usual.The Killer Whale with white hair. This man was probably Archie, the greatest warrior of the Whale Tribe. He had an important role in the Whale Tribe arc in the novel.He was the one who beat Lock up in the novel, and he was someone who was violent with a bad personality. However, his loyalty was quite strong.\u201cIt has been a while since I\u2019ve come down to the southern ocean.\u201dThis old, yet cool voice made Choi Han turn his head. Shickler, the Whale King, had a gentle smile on his face.He was the most handsome middle-aged man in the novel. The author seemed to have put his soul into this character, as the novel took four lines to describe Shickler\u2019s appearance.\u2018I can see why the author did that.\u2019But it wasn\u2019t like your appearance would feed you. Cale just needed to take in what he needed to take in.\u201cThe south is much warmer, isn\u2019t it?\u201dShickler\u2019s pupils started to cloud.\u2018He is just as Witira described.\u2019His daughter, Witira, had said that Cale was a weak yet strong person. As she mentioned, he was the weakest person on the deck but had no issue being confident.\u201cThe south is good as well. Thank you for saving my son. I came with my daughter because I wanted to personally thank you.\u201d\u201cNo need for such thanks. I just did what I needed to do.\u201dCale smiled gently as he reached his hand out respectfully. What would be the point of having a long discussion so late at night?\u201cSince we are both busy people, shall we get right to the point?\u201d\u201cSure. But you see..\u201dShickler let out a small sigh. Cale did the same before reaching his hand out.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dTap.Cale put his hand on Choi Han\u2019s shoulder.Shickler did a similar action.\u201cArchie.\u201dFor some reason, Archie and Choi Han were staring at each other. What beef would two people who had met for the first time have with each other? Cale put some strength into the hand on Choi Han\u2019s shoulder and Choi Han looked toward him.Choi Han was mesmerized by the Whale tribe\u2019s beauty a moment ago, so what would have made him so angry? This ship would sink with a single slash of his sword if Choi Han started to fight on the ship.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c...Cale-nim.\u201dChoi Han bit down on his lips. At that moment, someone gave Cale the answer. As usual, it was the Black Dragon, Raon.- That Whale checked you out from head to toe! How dare he!Cale could hear Raon huffing as he turned away from Choi Han.Archie. Archie was even worse than Toonka. You know, the ones who are on the good side but always cause trouble? Archie was that type of character.He was someone who only pledged his allegiance to Shickler and did not even care about anybody else, including other members of the Whale tribe. He was the troublemaker of the Whales. Cale finally made eye contact with Archie.\u2018Mm.\u2019Cale held back his groan. Archie really was looking at him with vicious eyes. Why was this punk acting like this? However, the answer was pretty obvious.\u2018Probably because I made Shickler personally come to meet me.\u2019Archie didn\u2019t care about the fact that Cale had saved Shickler\u2019s son nor the fact that he helped out the Whales with the mermaids. Cale stiffened up a bit after looking into the vicious eyes of someone who was even stronger than Witira.Shickler could see Cale stiffen up and urgently started to glare at Archie. He had told Archie not to do this multiple times, but Archie never seemed to listen.\u201cArchie, enou-.\u201dShickler stopped talking and turned his head.\u2018Father, young master Cale is very odd. It was only for a moment, but he felt really big.\u2019He recalled what Witira had said as he looked at Cale. He could see that Cale was once again standing leisurely, as if he had never stiffened up in the first place. However, the atmosphere around Cale was different. He finally understood why his daughter had said that Cale was strong.A gaze that seemed so deep that they could not fathom the deepness was aimed toward Archie. Choi Han, who had been watching from the side, subconsciously stopped frowning.\u201c...Cale-nim.\u201dHe then subconsciously called out to Cale as well, but Cale did not look at him. Choi Han oddly felt like that was only natural. Cale\u2019s gaze was dominating and only looked forward. The atmosphere around Cale also captured everyone\u2019s attention.It was different from a strong pressure. It was gentle yet firm, making it difficult to approach. It was because Cale was frowning.\u2018My body is responding on its own.\u2019The Vitality of the Heart responded to the pressure from Archie, making a bit of the Dominating Aura come out as well.The two powers working together made it possible for him to escape the strong pressure from Archie.Cale slowly started to speak.\u201cWho are you?\u201dSince it was like this anyway, he might as well squash him right now.Cale did not like Archie\u2019s gaze and slowly moved forward.Creak. Creak.The wooden planks on the deck creaked with his every step.\u201cJust who do you think you are.\u201dThe Dominating Aura revealed about half of its strength. Exactly half a step. Cale stopped in front of Archie and asked in a blunt manner.\u201cThat you dare to stare at me like this?\u201dArchie could not speak. He was definitely a bit taller than Cale, but it felt like Cale was looking down at him.Cale had definitely looked weak and he still felt like he would be able to kill Cale with a single hand, but he could not move.Archie could see the corner of Cale\u2019s lips starting to gently go up. Cale could also see that Archie\u2019s gaze had softened up, and so he coldly answered.\u201cIf you can\u2019t even answer that question.\u201dArchie could tell that the man in front of him, Cale, was looking down at him.\u201cThen don\u2019t get caught staring like that.\u201dCale and Archie stared at each other in silence for a few seconds until Archie\u2019s foot took a step backward. At that moment, Cale put away the Dominating Aura and started to smile as he looked toward Shickler.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, your majesty?\u201dCale did not want to fight with them since they would see each other a few more times in the future and they still needed to make some deals with each other. That was why he had only used half of the Domnating Aura and was now looking toward Shickler with the brightest smile he could muster.\u201c...Indeed.\u201dShickler answered after a few moments and grabbed onto Archie\u2019s shoulder with a very strong grip.\u201cApologize and introduce yourself.\u201dCale knew how Shickler had domesticated the troublemaker Archie. He beat him up. He beat up him so much that the entire ocean seemed to be filled with dust. He really beat him to a pulp while saying that a beating was the best medicine for a troublemaker. [1]Archie then came back to his senses and became Shickler loyal subordinate. That was why Cale knew that Archie would not hurt him even though he was glaring at him.Cale could see Archie bowing his head without looking at him.\u201c...I apologize.\u201dIt was a very quiet voice. He really didn\u2019t want to apologize. At least, that was what Cale thought as he glared at Archie. Archie quickly avoided his gaze when their eyes met.\u201cMy name is Archie.\u201d\u201cAlright. I am Cale Henituse.\u201dHe then heard Raon\u2019s voice in his head.- Human, you seemed almost as strong as the tip of my toenail just now. Good job! Very good job!Cale held back his sigh at this charisma that was complimented by a 4-year-old before gently reaching his hand out to Shickler, who was blankly staring at him.\u201cPlease give me the package.\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201dThe oddly frazzled Shickler seemed to have lost the regalness of a king and turned into a neighborhood uncle. That was how he was once you became close to him. Shickler looked toward Witira.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201d\u201cLong time no see. The package?\u201dWitira was relieved that Cale was still the same.\u2018Relieved? Me?\u2019She was shocked for a moment, but calmed herself before handing the package over. There were a total of three items that were now in Cale\u2019s hands. One of them was a small bottle with only the Dragon\u2019s dead mana contained inside, with the poison having been removed.Dead mana. This was very dangerous for a living person who did not have the darkness affinity. That was why Shickler was curious.\u201cBut why do you need this dead mana? There should be no humans who need it. Well, maybe the necromancers of old may find it useful, but there are none of them left. I don\u2019t know what you plan to do with this small amount.\u201dCale put on a mischievous smile.\u201cWho knows.\u201dWhat Cale needed was just this small amount. Cale put all the items into his magic bag and discussed a couple things with the Whale royalty before saying goodbye.\u201cSee you again next time. I apologize once again for Archie\u2019s actions today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNo, I insist. It\u2019s because that punk still has a lot to learn.\u201d\u201c...Father.\u201dWitira called out to calm her father before speaking to Cale.\u201cSee you again next time, young master Cale.\u201d\u201cSure thing.\u201dHe needed to see them multiple times since there were many ways he could still put them to use. Cale leisurely waved at the leaving Witira and Shickler, as well as the fidgeting Archie who said his goodbyes, before turning back toward his crew.\u201cChoi Han, what are you doing?\u201d\u201c...Ah, nothing.\u201dChoi Han was shocked when Cale called out to him and vigorously shook his head. Cale walked past Choi Han, who had been standing there with a blank expression on his face for a while, and headed into the ship.\u201cI\u2019m going to go sleep.\u201dThe Black Dragon Raon, who was following behind Cale, abruptly turned his head around and started to speak to Choi Han.\u201cI am Raon Miru, the handsome, beautiful, great and mighty existence! Remember that!\u201dChoi Han stared at the extremely excited dragon before observing Cale, who was his usual relaxed self.\u201c...I need to get stronger as well.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s voice disappeared into the ocean as he stood on the deck alone. Of course, if Cale had heard this, he would gasp in fear, thinking that an even stronger Choi Han would easily destroy this entire continent.***The next morning, Cale could see that Hong was grumbling next to the Black Dragon, who will now be called Raon.\u201cI like Raon, it is cool. But I think Ra-Hong would be nice too.\u201dOn the other hand, the usually quiet On seemed to be excited, as she was happily walking circles around Raon.\u201cRaon Miru! Our youngest\u2019s name is so good! It is the best!\u201dCale, who had been watching this while laying on his bed in the ship, turned away as Raon continued to shout.\u201cHey, Wolfie! I am Raon Miru! Hey, mage! I am Raon Miru! Choi Han!\u201d\u201cI know your name already.\u201dIt was so much that even the usually nice Choi Han was answering like this.Currently, Raon, the kittens, Choi Han, Lock, and Rosalyn were in Cale\u2019s room. Raon approached Choi Han.\u201cIf you know it, say it.\u201d\u201cSure, Raon.\u201dRaon started to smile. It was then that Choi Han turned toward Cale.\u201cMiru. How did you come up with that last name?\u201dChoi Han had an odd expression on his face. Cale understood the reaction. Choi Han did not seem to know the pure Korean, \u2018Raon,\u2019 but he seemed to know, \u2018Miru.\u2019\u201cSomething I made up?\u201d\u201cMade up?\u201d\u201cYes. I suddenly thought of that word when I looked at Raon. It just popped into my head. It was a very interesting experience.\u201dCale just casually answered as he continued to eat grapes while laying down. He then asked Choi Han as calmly as possible.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cNothing. It was just interesting.\u201dChoi Han\u2019s gaze was filled with nostalgia. It was because the name was pure Korean. He nodded his head and started to speak to Raon.\u201cRaon Miru. It is a cool name.\u201dRaon pretended not to hear what Choi Han had said, although his wings were fluttering with joy. Cale nonchalantly observed this before looking out the window toward the ocean. He hoped to arrive at the Whipper Kingdom soon.They arrived at the smallest port in the Whipper Kingdom in a few days, as Cale had wished. There was someone there to greet them, the most important player for this transaction.\u201cYoung master-nim!\u201dThe even chubbier Billos now further resembled a piggy bank. He jumped onboard to greet Cale on the deck. Billos seemed to be much lighter than his actual weight, as he agilely jumped on board as soon as the ship stopped.\u201cAigoo, young master-nim, I hope you didn\u2019t get seasick?\u201d- Seems like he is trying to suck up to you.But Cale actually really liked how Billos was acting. Cale patted Billos\u2019s shoulder and whispered in his ear.\u201cTime to catch a big fish?\u201dBillos started to smile so widely that his eyes almost disappeared.\u201cI will just trust you, young master-nim.\u201dThe Magic Tower will be destroyed and the liege of the Magic Tower will be ripped to shreds by Toonka. All of the mages inside the Magic Tower will be killed, however, the liege of the Magic Tower was a greedy person.Cale looked toward the messed up port that was very different from the ports of the Roan Kingdom and casually said aloud.\u201cTreasure hunts are so fun.\u201dAs long as you find the treasure, that is.1. (PR: I pity Witira and Paseton.) TL: You mean envy. You like the pain as a masochist\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

BIlos\u2019s eyes filled with anticipation as Cale started to speak.\u201cSo work hard if you need some treasure.\u201dIt was an indifferent command, but Billos still responded with excitement.\u201cAs hard as you need me to work, hehe.\u201dCale shook his head after seeing that Billos was clearly excited. He knew that there was a lot going on BIllos\u2019s mind, but that Billos was putting up this front.\u2018Since I didn\u2019t explain it thoroughly.\u2019All he had told Billos was two words.Magic Device. Billos had heard only those two words. Cale observed Billos leaving to work before turning to look at a certain person.He was looking at the person who needed to be the most cautious in the Whipper Kingdom.Rosalyn.The mage needed to be careful if she did not want to get hurt or even killed. Cale found her standing on the deck and approached her. It was so that he could warn her.\u201c...Miss Rosalyn.\u201dBut there was no need to do that. Cale stopped to think about what to say.\u201cWhat is it, young master Cale?\u201dCale had to ask after hearing the calm in her voice.\u201cIs that a club in your hand?\u201dThe club in Rosalyn\u2019s hand was causing strong gusts of wind as she swung it around. She looked like she was used to this. He could also see a light leather armor underneath her robe as she refreshingly answered Cale\u2019s question.\u201cIt is indeed a club. Whether it is a magic staff or a club, they\u2019re all the same when you use it to hit something.\u201d\u201cYou are very wise.\u201dCale was honestly in admiration as he gave her a thumbs up. There was no need for him to warn her about moving around the Whipper Kingdom as a mage.\u201cWise? I just wanted to make sure things didn\u2019t become difficult for everyone else because of me. I may not look like it, but I learned a variety of basic martial arts when I was young.\u201dTap. Tap.Rosalyn lightly tapped her other palm with the club. As part of the royal family, especially as the eldest child in line for the throne, she had learned self-defense, as well as some other basic martial arts.Her gaze suddenly became chilly.\u201cI also wanted to take a look at this place with my own eyes.\u201dCale started to smile. Rosalyn, the liege in charge of the new Magic Tower in the future, was a very just person like Choi Han. That was why she was able to grow together with her party members. However, she also had a definite goal as well as a cold rationality. The Whipper Kingdom would give her some complicated feelings, as well as an opportunity to learn.Cale followed Rosalyn\u2019s gaze to look toward the port.This was the least destroyed port in the Whipper Kingdom because it was the smallest one and because the regular citizens used it quite frequently. However, there were not many ships going in and out of the port, and the faces of the people getting off of the few ships arriving were very gloomy. However, the faces of the people living here were bright.\u2018Many of the citizens who were treated like slaves at the Magic Tower live here.\u2019Cale could see pillars of black smoke in the distance. Civil Wars always left behind destruction in their paths.\u201cYoung master-nim, we can move now. The carriage is prepared.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dCale nodded at Billos\u2019s statement and got off the ship. He started to speak after taking his first step into the Whipper Kingdom.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell that good.\u201dCale sniffed the musky smell of the burnt and destroyed buildings as he headed to the residence Billos had prepared for him. He started to speak to Billos once he got to his room.\u201cYou prepared quite well.\u201dCale complimented Billos, who had prepared the quietest residence by the port, a carriage with the Flynn Merchant Guild crest, as well as all of the other tiny details.Billos shrugged his shoulders as Cale asked one more thing.\u201cDid you make sure to do it quietly without others knowing about it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that only natural?\u201dCale smiled and responded back after seeing the greedy gaze in Billos\u2019s eyes.\u201cI knew I liked you.\u201d\u201cYou as well, young master-nim.\u201dCale leaned on the couch as he casually asked.\u201cVictory?\u201dBillos slowly nodded his head with a sincere expression.\u201cYes. It was as you explained, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIn the end, no, as expected, the non-mage faction had been victorious. Cale had arrived right on time for the end of the Civil War.There was only one thing that signaled the end of the Civil War.The destroyed Magic Tower.The fall of the mages\u2019 final fortress signaled the end of the Civil War. Of course, there were still things to take care of afterward the war.\u201cThat non-mage faction was wilder than I had expected.\u201dBillos started to frown as he described the Civil War.\u201cThey seem like they are not afraid of death and like they are only focused on killing mages.\u201dBillos\u2019s shoulders shook a bit as he tried to recall how it looked before the Civil War compared to the current situation. These two periods of time were the best time for him to make some money.However, he had seen much more than that.\u201cThey were especially scary whenever the citizens with magic resistance showed up in large numbers or took the vanguard.\u201dThe biggest influence in the battle between the mage faction and the non-mage faction was this, \u2018magic resistance.\u2019These citizens with magic resistance were slowly born through the generations, and the fact that there were only a few of them, as well as the fact that they could not learn any magic, made their lives difficult in the Whipper Kingdom.However, these citizens with magic resistance were born in large numbers during this generation, which ended up becoming an advantage for the non-mage faction.The citizens considered this as a sign from nature that they were to kill those arrogant mages who believed they could rule over nature with their mana.\u201cThis is especially true for the person named Toonka, the one in charge of the non-mage faction.\u201dCale was just silently listening.\u201cThat man and his direct subordinates really seemed to move based on instinct. I saw him just once from a distance and he was pulling a mage\u2019s neck off with his bare hands. You don\u2019t know how terrifying that was to witness.\u201dSigh.Billos let out a sigh as he shook his head.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even sleep properly that night. Just thinking about Toonka and his direct subordinates still makes me feel sick.\u201dBillos had made up his mind to absolutely avoid those people. It didn\u2019t feel like he could communicate with them. Thankfully, the staff around Toonka were smart and easy to talk to.\u201cIt must have been very cruel.\u201dBillos wildly nodded his head at Cale\u2019s short response.\u201cYes, it was very cruel. The corpses of those mages who were torn to shreds while they were still alive are hanging outside all of the castles.\u201dHowever, Billos did not say that that was bad.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure even that is not enough in the Whipper citizens\u2019 perspectives.\u201dBillos understood how they were feeling. Furthermore, as someone who was making money off of the Civil War, he was not in the position to say either side was good or bad.\u201cBut, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dBillos started to smile as he asked Cale a question. Cale\u2019s response felt cold, but Billos did not budge.\u201cWhere are we headed to now?\u201dBillos was very curious about their destination, as well as what the treasure was. He could see Cale, who had been quietly listening to everything he had to say, start to smile.This smile filled Billos with anticipation. Cale then started to speak.\u201cTo meet Toonka.\u201d\u201c...Excuse me? Who?\u201dBillos thought that he had heard wrong. The fact that he had not been able to sleep properly for a while may have affected his hearing.Cale continued to speak while looking at the confused expression that he had seen for the first time appear on Billos\u2019s face.\u201cWe are going to the Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThere were many reasons Cale had selected this very small port. It was the closest port to the Magic Tower, one out of the battle areas, and one where many of the citizens still lived.Cale leisurely continued to speak to Billos, who had a blank expression on his face but seemed to be thinking about a lot of things right now.\u201cJust trust me.\u201dBillos opened and closed his mouth a few times before jumping up and heading over to the cabinet in order to take out a bottle of alcohol. He then started to chug it and only stopped after emptying about half of the bottle into his mouth.\u201cI will trust my instincts.\u201d\u201cAnd what do your instincts say?\u201dBillos took out a new bottle and handed it to Cale.\u201cMy instincts are telling me to follow you, young master-nim.\u201dCale took a gulp straight from the bottle.\u201cYou have pretty good instincts. It is perfect for a merchant.\u201dCale seemed to be very relaxed. Bellos clenched onto the bottle in his hand as he looked past Cale\u2019s shoulders and out the window.Although the official Civil War was over, there were still screams throughout the Whipper Kingdom as all of the mages were not caught just yet. Madness, despair, sorrow, these were all still plentiful in the air.\u201cThis tastes great.\u201dBillos decided to follow his instincts even more after seeing Cale so calm.***A few days later, Cale stepped out of the carriage with the Flynn Merchant Guild crest. There were three more carriages behind him as well.\u201cYoung master-nim, this is as close as we can get to the Magic Tower in a carriage.\u201dCale could see the destroyed Magic Tower in the distance, but it was much less destroyed than he had expected.\u201cHe really kept his promise about not destroying it much.\u201dToonka had listened to what Cale had said.\u201cIt is a beautiful Magic Tower.\u201dBillos seemed to be in a daze next to Cale. At that moment, Cale took someone out of his pocket and showed a small corner of it to Billos.\u201cGasp!\u201dBillos let out a gasp.The golden plaque.He only saw a bit, but that was definitely a golden plaque. Billos\u2019s gaze instantly changed.\u201cYoung master-nim, I respect you very much.\u201dCale just ignored Billos as Hans approached him.\u201cYoung master-nim, what do you plan to do now?\u201dHans asked what Cale was going to do as he looked around. They were currently around the entrance of a base that was created in front of the Magic Tower.They could see lots of huts and houses. In fact, it seemed more like a village than a base based on the size. They could also see uniquely colored people as well. They were the citizens of the Whipper Kingdom.There were also other odd people as well. This made Hans\u2019s eyes start to quiver.\u201cMmph!\u201dHe then subconsciously covered his mouth with his hand. There were people who looked like warriors, but they were covered in blood and chopping up some corpses. They could tell that the corpses were wearing robes. These were all corpses of mages.Behind the corpses were the chopped off heads of the mages rolling on the ground.The scent of blood and rotting flesh overwhelmed Hans\u2019s nose as he started to hear the sound of corpses burning behind him.\u201cTake a break if it\u2019s too much.\u201dHans turned to look at the calm Cale and realized that everybody else around him was composed. Even Maes and the children, whom he recently learned were Wolves, were calmly observing the situation in front of them.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201c...Yes, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cThis is a battlefield.\u201dHans could feel the weight of those words. At the same time, he clearly looked into Cale's eyes that were coolly observing the entire battlefield.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It made him recall when he was Kim Rok Soo and working different jobs. He suddenly felt tired and had a desire to relax and read a book. However, his face was calm, as usual.Cale\u2019s gaze once again turned toward Hans as he asked Hans a question.\u201cWill you rest?\u201d\u201cI am okay, young master-nim!\u201dDeputy butler Hans could see Cale speaking to him in his usual self.\u201cThen let\u2019s work.\u201dThat made Hans feel better. Cale gathered everyone in front of him after verifying that Hans was calm.Since the Civil War was already over, Cale and crew were able to get to the base in front of the Magic Tower once they showed their identifications. The base was now just filled with people finally getting some rest after the long war.And the reason they were able to get so far was because Billos had traded materials with the warriors multiple times during the Civil War. They had come under the Flynn Merchant Guild\u2019s name.However, they were going to do something different starting now.\u201cWe came to meet someone named Toonka today. Make sure you do not respond to any provocations before that.\u201dChoi Han, who had been quietly listening, started to speak.\u201cWho is this person named Toonka?\u201d\u201cAh, that Bob guy from before is Toonka. Bob is an alias.\u201dCale just casually responded to Choi Han as he turned to look at Billos. However, he was able to hear Choi Han\u2019s quiet mumbling as he turned.\u201c\u2026So it is him.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dChoi Han responded with a calm expression, so Cale just let it go as he started to speak to Billos.\u201cBillos, you said you could get to the tent with the chiefs?\u201d\u201cYes. However, only about 6 people, including myself, can go.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you made quite a bit of money?\u201dThe fact that he was able to have conversations with the chiefs symbolized that Billos had made a lot of money through the Civil War. Billos just smiled and did not say anything else.At that moment, the invisible Raon started to speak in Cale\u2019s mind.Funny.\u2018Now what?\u2019Cale started to frown.I have a feeling that something entertaining will happen.\u2018Feeling?\u2019Cale got the chills and caressed his neck as he ignored Raon\u2019s words.He then quickly selected the four people who would go with him.\u201cChoi Han, Lock, Hilsman.\u201dCale made eye contact with Rosalyn. She had not said anything after looking around the residence once they arrived. Cale wondered whether she was angry about the death of her fellow mages.However, what Cale saw in Rosalyn\u2019s eyes was the gaze of a royal princess. Rather than getting angry because of the deaths of the mages, she was thinking about the stupidity of the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s royal family for keeping things as is until the citizens rebelled like this.\u201cMiss Rosalyn, you\u2019ll be coming, right?\u201dRosalyn fixed the large club over her leather armor as she answered.\u201cYes.\u201dThe people who would go with him had been decided. Cale decided to leave the rest to Hans.\u201cWe will go somewhere quiet and stay there! I will keep everyone safe!\u201dCale could see On and Hong snorting at deputy butler Hans\u2019s words. At the same time, they were asking Cale with their eyes.\u2018When will we go to the Magic Tower?\u2019Cale responded back with a gaze.\u2018Just wait a bit.\u2019They will soon be able to get to the location for the kittens to run wild.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dBillos put on a large necklace with the Flynn Merchant Guild crest on it and took the lead. Cale followed behind him.As soon as they entered into the base, they could feel multiple sharp gazes falling on them.\u201cJust look forward.\u201dEveryone looked forward like Cale said. The non-mage faction was made of citizens, knights, and the magic-resistant individuals. Cale\u2019s group stood out like a sore thumb amongst the faction members, who were all covered in blood.Cale could see the non-mage faction members in front of him as well.\u2018I guess they haven\u2019t had enough.\u2019They wanted war. He could feel the madness and chaos in the air around him. Cale recalled how Toonka had taken control of the Whipper Kingdom royalty and made them his puppets before rushing to fight with the Queen of the Jungle and the Empire.He took the time to look at the soldiers under the command of a tyrant like Toonka. They did not come up to provoke them or fight with them. They were just mesmerized by Toonka, who they instinctually feared. However, none of them backed away either. They just continued to viciously stare at Cale, who looked like a noble.\u201cWe are here.\u201dBillos stood in front of a tent. It was not very deep in the base, as Cale had expected. It was only a bit away from the entrance.\u201cHonestly speaking, the chiefs-.\u201d\u201cBillos.\u201dCale cut Billos off because he knew what Billos was going to say.The non-mage faction thinks that they destroyed their, \u2018rationality,\u2019 but in reality, a different kind of rationality had exploded in its place.Are only mages smart? Are they the only educated ones?No. There were many others who were educated as well. The scientists had come under Toonka because they were tired of being suppressed by the mages.\u2018They hate magic even more than Toonka does.\u2019You could just consider them to be crazy. It is even scarier when smart people go crazy.\u201cContact them.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dBillos approached the largest tents in the chiefs\u2019 section. A warrior approached him to guide him and watch him.The chiefs\u2019 tent. There were many more warriors here than the other areas. It was interesting that Toonka had no problem throwing away weak warriors but were protecting these chiefs.\u2018That is why he couldn\u2019t become a real hero.\u2019Cale ignored the sharp gazes of the guards and waited for Billos to come back with the chiefs. He just needed to ask them to meet with Toonka and they would probably welcome it with open arms.However.\u2018Why does my neck feel so cold?\u2019Cale looked around to see what might be causing this odd feeling. Billos was taking longer than he had expected. It should not take this long to come back with a single person.Human.Raon\u2019s low voice rang in Cale\u2019s mind as the entrance flap to the tent Billos entered started to move. It looked like a large person was trying to run out.\u2018No way?\u2019Suddenly, Choi Han, who had been standing behind Cale, stepped in front of Cale with a stiff expression.\u201cChoi Han?\u201d\u201cI have a bad feeling about this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRiiip! The tent entrance ripped open.\u201cI smell it! I smell the scent of a strong person! Muahahahaha! This is perfect! I was so bored!\u201dA large man covered in blood revealed himself. Behind him was a man and a woman who were slightly smaller than him, but still quite large.\u201cSigh.\u201dCale let out a sigh.The crazy person who was covered in blood as if he had showered in mage blood was naturally Toonka. As usual, Toonka was accurately looking at a specific location.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201dHe was looking at Choi Han, who was protecting Cale from him. Toonka did not seem to even see Cale behind Choi Han.\u201cThe other ones smell strong too, but you seem to be the strongest! I can\u2019t sleep while smelling such a scent!\u201dCale decided he needed to step forward. However, Choi Han asked in a very low voice.\u201cIs he Toonka?\u201d\u201cOh, you recognized him right away.\u201dCale just answered Choi Han\u2019s question without thinking, and Toonka pointed to Choi Han at the same time.\u201cFight me. Aren\u2019t your hands itching too?\u201dCale let out a sigh. Toonka really never seemed to change.Choi Han would naturally decline as his personality was not one who would fight for no reason. He would definitely not fight with someone he had just met.Cale tried to walk past Choi Han, who was in front of him. That was when he heard Choi Han\u2019s voice.\u201cSure.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019Raon\u2019s voice echoed in Cale\u2019s head.Just as I expected. I, the great and mighty Raon, is smart!Contrary to Raon\u2019s excited voice, Cale started to frown.On the other hand, Toonka licked his lips after seeing the way Choi Han was glaring at him. He only had Choi Han in his eyes and did not see anybody else. Choi Han had the strongest scent here. It was the same scent that made him think of the Whale people who were staring back at him in the Ubarr territory.\u201cKekeke, yes, I like that type of gaze.\u201dToonka was excited. He felt like he could have a physical fight, one that did not rely on crap like magic.Choi Han put his hand on the hilt of his blade after seeing the madness in Toonka\u2019s eyes. He was calm, but his gaze seemed like it wanted to chop Toonka in half.Screech.A part of the blade came out of the scabbard.It was at that moment.Squeeze.Choi Han felt a strong grip on his shoulder and suddenly got the chills. He had felt this once before.It was the same pressure that caught everyone\u2019s attention when they were with the Whales. A quiet yet emotionless voice reached Choi Han\u2019s ear.\u201cChoi Han.\u201dCale was looking at him. Cale wasn\u2019t blaming him or giving him a command, but his gaze seemed to be extremely deep. That gaze made Choi Han subconsciously let go of the blade.Click.The blade was pushed back into the scabbard.\u201cAre you trying to fight right now?\u201dThe Dominating Aura was surrounding Cale\u2019s entire body right now. He walked past Choi Han and faced Toonka.The stench of blood filled his nose.\u201cToonka.\u201dCale needed to stand above Toonka now. It became a little more complicated, but he decided that he might as well use this opportunity. Cale pushed back his red hair and greeted the blankly staring Toonka.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cYou, you ar-\u201cToonka did not recognize him right away. However, as soon as he saw the red hair, he thought of a single person. However, this person in front of him was too different from the last time they had met. He clenched his fist. An unexplainable feeling was coming out of this bastard in front of him.The bastard that shoved him in the ocean and looked down on him, Cale Henituse. His gaze was the same as two months ago. The man he saw two months ago asked him a question.\u201cDo you want to fight?\u201dCale had a calm smile as he asked. However, he did not wait for Toonka\u2019s response.\u201cChoi Han.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes sir.\u201dChoi Han could not help but nod his head at Cale\u2019s indifferent voice.\u201cFight him if you want.\u201dChoi Han could only answer in one way.\u201cI will definitely win.\u201dChoi Han put his hand back on the hilt of his blade. His tightly clenched fist let him feel a stronger desire than before. Cale then turned toward Toonka, who was slowly starting to smile. Toonka then let out a loud laugh.\u201cMuhahahahahahahha!\u201dIt was so loud it echoed through the base. However, Toonka was still nervous. The person in front of him was definitely weak, however!There was an aura that dominated this area. Toonka ignored that aura and shouted even louder. He was excited. His body was heating up. Blood, he needed to see blood.\u201cLet\u2019s fight! Great! Very good!\u201dIn that moment, Raon was scoffing at Toonka as he spoke to Cale.He\u2019s crazy for a beating. What an idiot. Our side is much stronger!It was only obvious. Toonka would probably get beaten to a pulp.Choi Han was not the type to go easy in a fight. Cale looked toward the even crazier looking Toonka, who was laughing like a maniac, and started to speak to Choi Han.\u201cNo need to hold back.\u201dThat made Choi Han start to smile. This smile did not look pure and innocent at all. That smile satisfied Cale and he called over to Toonka.\u201cBob.\u201dThe sudden return of his alias from two months ago made Toonka stop laughing. Cale then glanced at Toonka\u2019s subordinates, as well as the warriors who were slowly approaching the chiefs\u2019 tents and the people who were too scared to move. He looked back at Toonka afterward and started to speak.\u201cSet it up.\u201dThey might as well do it right if they were going to fight anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was nothing special about it. The citizens who went crazy for battle moved some of the tents near the training ground to create a larger area for the battle.Weak human, the chubby human is staring at you.Cale turned his gaze after hearing Raon\u2019s voice. Billos was staring at Cale from a distance. Cale casually made a shooing motion toward Billos.The chiefs were next to Billos, but now was not the time to worry about it. Cale turned his gaze to the front as a shadow appeared in front of him.\"I will guide you to the front.\"It was the large woman, Pelia, Toonka's left arm and a master of the spear. She pointed toward the front of the audience section of the arena. His expression immediately stiffened.\"There is no need to do that.\"Cale did not want to be at the closest place to the arena at all. He would the first to die if Toonka is sent flying or Choi Han accidentally launches his aura toward the wrong spot.\"We have to give you the best spot.\"As Pelia said that and looked forward, Cale could see the soldiers create a path to the center of the arena. It was a miracle for such wild people to be so coordinated.Pelia really deserved her position as Vice General.Cale sighed and followed the path to the front of the arena. He had already hidden his Dominating Aura, but Pelia and the soldiers could not take their eyes off of Cale.His slow pace made it seem like he was on a casual stroll, while the young man and woman walking behind him looked dangerous.Why are you going to a dangerous place? You can not do this because you are weak! It does not matter if you have become as strong as the tip of my claw!But Cale was just walking slowly because he did not want to go. He couldn\u2019t do anything about Raon's nagging. Rosalyn and Lock did not look good following behind Cale as well.\"Young master Cale.\"\"What is it?\"Rosalyn cautiously looked toward the arena where Choi Han and Toonka would fight against each other.\"What if this makes them hate us?\"\u2018Hate?\u2019Cale's eyes were full of confusion.Lock then approached Cale and started to whisper.\"As Noona mentioned, wouldn\u2019t it be bad if Choi Han hyung ends up winning? What if they get angry? Don\u2019t you think Toonka would be angry and decide not to trade with us? \"Neither Rosalyn nor Lock had any doubts about Choi Han winning. This was the same for Cale. However, Cale was thinking a little differently than the two of them.Cale slowly sat down on the chairs that were provided for the high ranking officials. He then pointed to the seats on either side of him for the two people still standing.\"Are you going to stand the whole time?\"Rosalyn and Lock sat in the chairs with concern still on their faces. Then Cale\u2019s voice reached their ears.\"There is no need to worry.\"Toonka was not that strong. Of course, he was strong compared to the average person, but he was outrageously weak compared to Whales and Dragons.However, Toonka would never have come to this position if he had suffered after meeting a stronger being and vowed revenge on all of them.He was not the only one who was like that.\"Just look around.\"Rosalyn turned her gaze as Cale pointed to the open space. It was at that moment.\"Woo! Woo! Woo!\"Voices echoed in the wide open space. The shouts of the soldiers around the arena rang in Rosalyn\u2019s ears. There was more.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of the citizens stomping their feet filled the area. Lock, who had been watching, could feel the vibrations underneath his feet. Once the citizens started to stomp, the soldiers and knights all started to stomp as well.\"Woo! Woo! Woo!\"Boom! Boom! Boom!And that noise gradually grew louder. It seemed like the earth itself was shouting.\"Young master! What, what is going on?\"The timid Lock looked at Cale with a pale expression. He could see Cale smiling.He answered for both Lock and Rosalyn.\"Winning or losing does not matter to them.\"At that time, Pelia came near Cale to sit behind him. She also heard what Cale had to say.\"The Warriors\u2019 Ritual.\"She stopped sitting down and looked at Cale, who continued to look forward without noticing Pelia\u2019s reaction. The two warriors slowly made their way into the arena.Choi Han and Toonka. Cale continued to speak while looking at the two of them.\"To fight.\"For Toonka's people, victory or defeat was not important. Fighting was the only thing that mattered. In particular, if the opponent was not an enemy, the fighting between warriors was rather sacred.\"Only that is important.\"Cale finished speaking and leaned over the back of the chair as much as possible. He was afraid of getting hurt after seeing Toonka and Choi Han entering the arena.At that time, he heard Raon's voice.Do not worry, weak human. I am stronger than the two of them! You will not get hurt.It was a voice filled with pity. Cale did not like the tone of Raon\u2019s voice, so he continued to lean back before turning around.\"What is it?\"\"It is nothing.\"Cale saw that Pelia was sitting down and turned his gaze forward. He then also sat up straight. He didn\u2019t want Pelia, who was loyal to Toonka, to get angry for his casual demeanor.Yes. Do not sit like a wimp and sit up proudly! Human, you are doing well!Cale ignored Raon\u2019s ramblings as he observed Hota, one of Toonka\u2019s other subordinates, stepping forward as referee.\u2018Not that they really need one.\u2019Until your opponent faints or gives up. That was the rule of these people. Fainting in such a battle was embarrassing for these people.\"Young master, I don\u2019t need to worry?\"\"Yes, you can just relax Miss Rosalyn.\"Cale responded to Rosalyn's question and watched Hota start to shout in order to get people\u2019s attention. He then blew a small flute.Beeeeeeeep-!The battle had begun.It would be nice if they ran toward each other right away, but Choi Han and Toonka both continued to stare at each other without moving. Cale watched this without thinking much about it.At that moment, he could hear Toonka\u2019s voice. The arena was large, but since they were in the front, it was not difficult to hear their voices. It also helped that Toonka had a very loud voice.\"Why do you care about what the weakling thinks?\"\u2018The weakling?\u2019Cale felt like it was referring to him.\u2018Choi Han is wary of me? Why?\u2019Cale had a question, but could not think of it any longer. It was because Rosalyn and Lock kept peeking his way. Toonka definitely was referring to him when he said weakling.Choi Han's voice could be heard at that time.\"\u2026What did you just say?\"His voice was very low. Cale could see the mocking smile on Toonka\u2019s face.\u201cI said why do you care what the weakling thinks! The weaklings are the first to die in any battlefield! I\u2019m sure you know that!\u201dRosalyn and Lock started to frown. At that moment, the two of them heard something in their ears.\"Sigh.\"Cale\u2019s sigh made Lock shut up. Lock\u2019s claws were becoming sharper and slowly getting longer. Rosalyn brushed her face with her fingers. However, the two of them soon stopped moving.\u201cPoor bastard.\u201d\u2026Poor bastard? The two of them both had confusion on their faces as they looked toward Cale. Cale had a blank expression as if he had never sighed in the first place as he looked toward the arena.The Choi Han that Cale knew had been transported to the hell known as the Forest of Darkness when he was just a sophomore in high school. He was the weakest existence in that forest for the longest time. Cale felt bad for Toonka, who was telling such a person that the weakest would be the first to die.\"Young master Cale, who are you calling a poor-\"\"\u2026Just take a look for yourself.\"Cale pointed to the arena instead of answering Rosalyn.At that moment, Choi Han took the sword strap off of his waist. The sword flew out of the corner of the arena once Choi Han threw it in the air.Plop.Cale could hear the sound of the sword falling to the ground, but he just nodded his head as he started to mumble.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely better to beat someone up with your bare hands.\u201dLock and Rosalyn both flinched and watched as Cale\u2019s words became reality.Wham!\u201cUgh!\u201dRosalyn could now tell who Cale was calling a poor bastard.Pow! Pow!Boom!Boooom!The arena was silent.Nobody could talk. However, Raon\u2019s voice was going off in Cale\u2019s head.He\u2019s being beaten to a pulp!Raon was correct. Choi Han was beating Toonka up without holding anything back.\u201cUgh, you bastard!\u201dToonka moved very quickly for someone his size as he rushed toward Choi Han and threw a punch.Pang.It made a cute noise as Choi Han blocked it with his palm. Choi Han then closed his fist around Toonka\u2019s hand as he darted toward Toonka. All of this happened in an instant.Cale could not see past that point. However, he could hear it.Booom!Toonka\u2019s body was flung to the ground. The arena was filled with dust from the impact.\u201cUgh!\u201dToonka was having a difficult time breathing. However, Cale could see that Toonka was still smiling.\u201cGreat! This strength! A battle of st- ugh!\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201dHowever, Choi Han did not allow Toonka to keep smiling.Cale could see Toonka raise his arms in an attempt to block Choi Han\u2019s attack, but Choi Han\u2019s kick still flung Toonka into the air.\u201cUgh! Hahaha!\u201dToonka was laughing even as he was sent flying. He then twisted his body and tried to attack again. However, the results were the same. He ended up getting beaten again and again.All Cale could see was Toonka\u2019s bloodied clothes, his face that was slowly getting swollen to the point that they couldn\u2019t even tell it was Toonka, and the dust that was consistently being kicked up into the air.\u201cHehe\u2026hehe, I will not fall!\u201dToonka got up while staggering to the side. At that moment, Cale could hear Raon\u2019s serious voice.\u2026Why is he laughing after getting hit? Does he enjoy getting hit?\u00a0[1]Cale looked up toward the sky. However, he could still hear what sounded like a punching bag being beaten up.There was no way that Choi Han, someone who could fight against the Whales, would not be able to beat Toonka up easily. Only Choi Han had the strength to fight against both Raon and the Whale King, Shickler. He really deserved his title of the main character.Pow! Pow!Cale continued to look up at the sky with curiosity.When will Choi Han finish beating Toonka up?Wasn\u2019t it about time for Toonka to run out of strength?However, Toonka was just too strong.\u201cYoung master Cale, shouldn\u2019t we stop Choi Han?\u201dCale gave a short response to Rosalyn\u2019s cautious question.\u201cWe cannot get involved in the Warriors\u2019 Ritual. It can only end with the will of one of the warriors. All we can do is watch this sacred ritual from the side.\u201dCale did not know that all of the high ranking warriors were looking at him as he said that. He just looked back down after hearing another punching noise followed by a bang.\u201cHehehe, you are a really strong bastard. Spit!\u201dToonka spit out some blood and continued to laugh. Choi Han looked toward him with disgust. It looked like Choi Han had realized how crazy Toonka was.He would continue to smile no matter how much he was beaten up. He will stand back up even after being beaten to a pulp repeatedly. He would never give up. He seemed like a character out of a children\u2019s cartoon.\u2018That is why he is such a crazy bastard.\u2019Cale could see Toonka\u2019s morale starting to go down. He could not even tell whether Toonka even had his eyes open anymore.Toonka looked terrible as he let out a shout and rushed forward once more.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dToonka then started to fly away.\u201c\u2026Looks like he is blasting off.\u201dToonka was flung high into the sky. Choi Han\u2019s half transparent black aura had sent Toonka soaring into the air.\u201cHuh, huh?\u201d\u201cD, dodge!\u201d\u201cEverybody move!\u201dThe soldiers rushed backward in order to dodge Toonka\u2019s body as Toonka came flying their way.Booom!A large ditch was formed as if a meteor had struck down and caused an explosion. Toonka had fainted inside this ditch. Fainting was what Toonka found to be the most embarrassing.Choi Han walked over to Cale like he didn\u2019t even need to check on Toonka. Cale quickly got up, as if this was the moment he had been waiting for the entire battle.Rosalyn and Lock, who also got up at that moment, started to flinch. This was the same for Toonka\u2019s subordinates who were heading toward Toonka.That feeling they had gotten earlier. That gentle yet anxiety provoking feeling. Cale reached his hand out to Choi Han who had approached him.\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cYes, Cale-nim.\u201dChoi Han grabbed Cale\u2019s hand and started to smile. Cale surrounded his body with the dominating aura before looking around. The gaze that Toonka\u2019s companions gave Choi Han and himself was worlds apart from the original gaze that Toonka\u2019s group had given them when they had arrived.Cale had a smile on his face.Now it was set up properly. It was set up exactly as Cale had wanted.Tap. Tap.Toonka woke up from someone tapping on his cheeks. Pelia was waking him up. However, Toonka was looking at Cale who was behind her.Cale looked down at the collapsed Toonka as he started to speak.\u201cTake me to the Magic Tower.\u201d1. Our PR\u2019s masochistic friend.

He blankly blinked a few times before slowly starting to frown as if he remembered what had happened.\u201cI lost.\u201dHowever, he was calm when he started to speak. Cale then proceeded to speak.\u201cIt was still a warriors\u2019 battle.\u201dToonka blankly stared at Cale before slowly starting to smile. He looked extremely ugly with that expression on his face. His face, that already looked like an orc\u2019s because of the beating he had just received, now looked like a mutant troll\u2019s face. It was full of blue bruises.Cale turned away to stop seeing that ugly face. He could hear Toonka starting to speak as he turned. Toonka was speaking to Pelia.\u201cA new warrior has appeared today!\u201dCale could see soldiers approaching them after hearing Toonka\u2019s loud voice. There was anticipation on the faces of the citizens. They did not seem to look down on their leader for fainting or have any animosity toward Choi Han for beating up their leader.Warrior.It was a cool title that was incomparable to those stupid mages. Someone who deserved such a title had appeared.\u201cWe will have a celebration tonight! Get it prepared!\u201dBoom. Boom. Boom.The citizens started to stomp their feet again. At the same time, they cheered for both Choi Han and Toonka. Although these citizens were called barbarians because of such actions, Cale did not care.Of course, there will definitely be some soldiers whose morale goes down because Toonka lost, as well as some high-ranking people who will have animosity toward Cale\u2019s crew.\u2018Not my concern.\u2019He just needed to take what he needed to take. Cale could hear Toonka speaking to Choi Han behind him.\u201cWarrior! I will definitely kill you next time! Muhahahahahaha!\u201dCale turned around to see Choi Han frowning deeply. Choi Han had deeply disliked Toonka in the novel. He then heard Toonka speaking to him.\u201cI destroyed it less, per our agreement!\u201dIt meant they were now going to go look at the Magic Tower.Cale climbed back up and patted the pale Billos\u2019s shoulder.\u201cBillos.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cGo get everybody from outside the base.\u201dBillos seemed confused, but accepted before pointing to someone else.\u201cOf course. But there is someone I need to introduce first.\u201dCale looked toward who Billos was pointing at. Brown hair and brown eyes along with an extremely average face. He seemed so common and average, but it was so much so that it made him look unique.\u201cYoung master-nim, this is Chief Harol-nim. He is currently the Supreme Chief in charge of the entire faction.\u201dHarol. He was a necessary member of the non-mage faction.\u201cNice to meet you, young master Cale-nim. My name is Harol.\u201dThe peasants of the Whipper Kingdom did not have last names. Cale reached his hand out to Harol.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Cale.\u201dHarol cautiously shook Cale\u2019s hand before quietly starting to whisper.\u201cI guess young master Cale-nim is who our leader Toonka-nim said he was going to sell the Magic Tower to.\u201dCale did not say anything and just smiled as he let go of Harol\u2019s hand.Harol. Harol was neither a very strategic person nor a strong individual. He also did not have any unique abilities. He was a great scientist, but he was lacking compared to the other chiefs.However, he was one of the founding members of the non-mage faction.The mages had considered themselves above the regular citizens because of their magic abilities. Harol had been the one who had brought up the idea of saving the people from such tyranny. To them, he was a hero.People followed him because of how average he was. Toonka and Harol, this combination was the hope for the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s citizens.\u201cIt is my honor to meet you. I guess we have a lot to discuss from here on.\u201dThe non-mage faction needed money. Harol probably wanted to take as much money as possible from Cale. At that moment, Cale could hear Raon\u2019s voice in his head.- What a liar.The dragon really was sharp. Cale gently responded to Harol.\u201cI suppose so.\u201dAn unfair trade. That trade started from Harol and not Toonka.***Cale stood in front of the Magic Tower and looked up.The 20 story Magic Tower was the second tallest building on the entire continent. The tallest building was the Empire\u2019s Alchemist Bell Tower.\u2018It\u2019s better than I expected.\u2019Toonka had destroyed the Magic Tower less than Cale had anticipated. There were only a few outer walls that were destroyed. In comparison, all the windows and the insides were a total mess.\u2018This isn\u2019t all there is to the Magic Tower.\u2019Cale turned away from the Magic Tower to look at Toonka.\u201cAre you going in as well?\u201dThe question made Toonka start to frown.\u201cYou think I am crazy? Why would I go into that dirty place?\u201dDirty place. Toonka was calling this famous building that was known throughout the Western Continent a, \u2018dirty place.\u2019 It was dirty to him because the citizens\u2019 blood, sweat, and tears were shed inside of this building.\u201cHarol will guide you.\u201dToonka said that before peeking toward Beacrox, Hilsman, the Wolf children, and Lock. It was because he smelled strong scents from them as well. He then also peeked toward the two baby kittens in Cale\u2019s arms.He then looked toward Choi Han, who was talking to Rosalyn, before casually starting to speak.\u201cYou are interesting because you are weak.\u201dCale naturally ignored Toonka, however, Toonka continued to speak.\u201cA weakling who oddly seems strong.\u201dHowever, Toonka could not say anything else. It was because Choi Han had started to stare at him. Toonka started to smile brightly at Choi Han\u2019s stare before he started to approach him.\u201cWhat? You want to fight again?\u201dChoi Han sighed before ignoring Toonka. Cale observed Toonka and Choi Han\u2019s interaction before taking a look at Billos and Harol discussing with one another. He then started petting the kittens in his arms while starting to quietly sing.\u201cLet\u2019s catch a rat, let\u2019s catch a rat. How many rats?\u201dOn\u2019s front paw moved in Cale\u2019s arms.Tap.She hit him once.Cale continued to speak.\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him though. Life is precious.\u201dHong snorted before moving his front paw.Tap. Tap.He tapped twice before his tail started to wag. On started to shake her head after seeing the smiles on Cale and Hong\u2019s faces. The two of their villainous smiles were becoming similar the longer they were together.However, On\u2019s tail was shaking as well.At that moment, a stealthy voice filled Cale\u2019s mind.- Should I come with you too, human?Raon really must want to go with them, as he even asked Cale for permission. Cale sternly shook his head. Cale quietly whispered as if he was gently speaking to the kittens.\u201cYou have to catch something else with me.\u201dThe baby kittens and Black Dragon all closed their mouths after seeing Cale\u2019s expression as he said, \u2018something else.\u2019 That sounded fun as well.Harol and Toonka soon approached Cale. Toonka pointed to Harol with friendliness.Our chief will guide you. Pelia will go with you as well.\u201dPelia was going to be Harol\u2019s guard. Cale nodded his head and asked.\u201cDid you clean up the corpses of the mages in the tower?\u201d\u201cI left a few there.\u201dCale knew this would be the case and kept a straight face. At that moment, Raon started to speak.- I guess you are only afraid of mermaid corpses. Don\u2019t worry, I will make sure the mermaids can\u2019t get to you in the future.\u2018...I\u2019m not really afraid of the mermaids either.\u2019However, Cale did not say that out loud since he should not run into any mermaids in the future.Toonka observed Cale\u2019s calm demeanor before continuing to speak.\u201cThose bastards do not need their souls consoled.\u201dThe consolation of the soul referred to cremation.The citizens burned mage corpses whenever possible. Of course, there were some corpses with their heads rolling around on the ground, but those corpses would soon be burnt as well.However, there must be a reason for the corpses they left behind not to be burnt.\u2018Probably the ones that killed the most citizens.\u2019What do you need the most of to advance magic devices?Experiments.What would they experiment on?People.There were many mages who performed experiments on humans in secret.\u201cI plan on getting rid of them when there are no more mages left in this kingdom. There will be no traces of them left.\u201dToonka quietly mumbled, contrary to his usual self. However, Cale did not pay much attention to his words.Although all of the mages in the tower were dead, not all of the mages in the Whipper Kingdom were dead.\u2018The Mage Tower mages were all part of the mage faction.\u2019They were hierarchical and greedy. A tower is naturally going to have a top and a bottom. The people on top enjoyed looking down on the people down below.However, there were some mages who stayed far away from power and greed. They preferred not to take part in politics or anything of power. Those mages were currently in hiding, trying to find a way out of the Whipper Kingdom, as well as trying to determine where to go.Crown prince Alberu Crossman would be their shield. Alberu will gather together the mages who are only interested in magic research under his wings.Cale then asked Toonka.\u201cCan I go in?\u201dCale put the two kittens in his arms down on the ground. They will stealthily investigate on their own as long as the entrance door remains open.Beacrox and Choi Han stood behind Cale. Seeing Beacrox there, Cale had a confused expression on his face. However, Beacrox was looking toward the still bruised and battered Toonka with disgust.\u201cHarol.\u201d\u201cYes, leader-nim. Young master Cale-nim, I will guide you.\u201dScreech.The Magic Tower\u2019s door opened and Cale started to frown. He casually started to speak to Harol and Toonka, who were both looking at him.\u201cThe rotten stench is strong.\u201dThe first floor of the Magic Tower. As soon as the door opened, Cale could see a corpse wearing the golden robe that symbolized the liege of the Magic Tower, as well as the destroyed remains of the devices inside. Cale started to speak with disgust at the crazy people who caused all this.\u201cLeave the door open to ventilate. I can\u2019t stand this type of smell.\u201dHe then started to speak to Toonka.\u201cAnd cover the corpse. I\u2019m a weakling so I can\u2019t stand looking at a corpse for long.\u201dToonka snorted, but still motioned to a soldier guarding the entrance. Cale verified the pale, yet calm Rosalyn, before leaving her and the others behind and entering the Magic Tower.Choi Han quickly stood in front of him with Beacrox behind him.\u201cShall I guide you floor by floor?\u201d\u201cChief Harol.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe top.\u201dThere was no reason to look anywhere else.\u201c... The top?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious about what it feels like to look down from the top. The liege\u2019s room. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThey got on the elevator, the only device that was still functioning in the Magic Tower. It would instantly take them up to the 20th floor.\u201cYou somehow managed to not break this.\u201d\u201cJust in case we needed it.\u201dHarol gently responded, but Cale had to hold back his snort.Oooooong.The only remaining magic device in the Magic Tower started to move with a gentle vibration. The platform that Cale and crew were standing on slowly started to move up. It finally stopped once they got to the top of the Magic Tower.Cale looked at the single door on the top floor and started to speak.\u201cIs that the liege\u2019s room?\u201d\u201cYes it is. Ah, young master-nim?\u201dCale did not respond to Harol\u2019s call and started to walk.The others quickly followed behind him. Cale walked to the door and turned the knob.Click.The door opened and the liege\u2019s room revealed itself.\u201cWhat a mess.\u201dCale\u2019s blunt assessment was heard by everyone else.An area as wide as an entire floor was in front of them. It definitely was a mess.Everything inside the liege\u2019s room was destroyed. There was also blood everywhere. It looked like they had splashed blood around the room on purpose.\u201cA total mess. Chief Harol, can I go to that window over there?\u201dThe only symbol of the liege\u2019s room. The only undestroyed thing remaining in this room was the view from that large window.\u201cOf course. Let me guide you there.\u201d\u201cI want to think in silence. Can I go alone?\u201d\u201c...That is a bit\u2026\u201dSeeing Harol looking uncomfortable, Choi Han moved away from the liege\u2019s room and stood in front of the elevator.\u201cI will be right here.\u201dBeacrox went and stood next to Choi Han as well. He looked thankful that he did not need to go into such a dirty and messy place. However, Pelia was still uncomfortable. Nevertheless, Harol had made up his mind and started to speak.\u201cPelia-nim, I will guide young master Cale-nim over there. Will five minutes alone with me be fine, young master-nim?\u201d\u201cOf course. Keep one door open. That way, she can feel at ease.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dCale returned Pelia\u2019s thanks with a smile.The liege\u2019s room had a double door entrance. They kept one of them open as Cale entered the room. The twentieth floor. The liege\u2019s room was very wide as the liege had occupied the entire floor for himself.That was why most people would not be able to hear Cale\u2019s voice once they got to the window at the edge of the room.\u2018Choi Han might be able to hear it, but it doesn\u2019t matter if he does.\u2019Cale crossed through the destroyed items in the room. Tables, chairs, books, carpets, everything was now trash.Cale stood in front of the window that was the furthest away from the door and started to speak.\u201cYou broke everything?\u201dHarol confidently responded to Cale\u2019s question.\u201cOf course. This was the room of the worst person in the Magic Tower. This was the room of a monster made from mana.\u201dA monster made from mana. This was what the warriors used when referring to mages.- What a liar.Raon was grumbling in disbelief, but Cale did not care. Instead, he started to whisper in Harol\u2019s ear. He was talking about Harol\u2019s secret that nobody else knew about.\u201cYou say that, but you are a mage as well.\u201dHe could feel mana, but his heart resisted mana. He was a mixed child of a mage and a magic resistant person. The unluckiest of all mana users.The secret of a person\u2019s birth was quite common in this world.\u201cChief Harol, no.\u201dCale put his hand on the completely pale Harol and called out to him.\u201cHarol Kodiang.\u201dThe phrase about how a smart person going crazy was scary definitely was referring to Harol Kodiang.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to erase all traces of your father?\u201dThe liege of the Magic Tower, Pister Kodiang, did not know about Harol. This was a child who was born without his knowledge. A true monster that the monster made from mana had created.\u201cHow did you know?\u201dCale gently responded to the monster who asked him that question with a bitter smile on his face.\u201cLet me hear your answer first.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to say something like how he was going to buy the Magic Tower. Instead, Cale spoke about what he knew to be Harol\u2019s desire.\u201cI will get rid of the Magic Tower for you. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was the phrase that was quite famous for being the Magic Tower\u2019s liege\u2019s favorite phrase.Harol Kodiang. He was born between a mage and a magic resistant citizen, and he had the unique traits of both sides. However, his appearance did not look anything like the citizens at all.\u201c...Are you planning on using my bloodline as blackmail?\u201dCale looked down from the 20th floor instead of responding to the question right away.There were a lot of memorable extra characters in, \u2018The Birth of a Hero.\u2019 Harol Kodiang was one of them.His mother passed away while giving birth to him alone, and his father did not even know of his existence.That was the start of Harol\u2019s anger.\u2018However, there was something Harol did not know.\u2019It was something only the author and the readers would know. That one line was enough to make Harol\u2019s anger worthless.< Harol Kodiang. He was a product of his parents\u2019 love, but unfortunately, he would never know the truth. >The novel did not go into detail about it. All it said was that the liege of the Magic Tower met her when he was out training as a young mage and fell in love.Cale continued to look out the window before speaking to the son of the Magic Tower\u2019s liege, who ended up destroying the Magic Tower.\u201cWhy would I use it to blackmail you? Being related to someone by blood is not a sin.\u201dHarol did not have a response. Cale turned his head to look at Harol.\u201cPlus, aren\u2019t you all the ones who are in a rush?\u201dThey were currently between spring and summer, with the fall harvest season right in front of them. All of them had rebelled against the Magic Tower because they could not handle the taxation of the Magic Tower any longer.Harol needed to fill the people\u2019s desire in order for them to rise up once again.In fact, Harol was someone who wanted war even more than Toonka did. He wanted to destroy the seeds of mages in the entire world.\u201c...There is a mage within your crew.\u201d\u201cYes there is.\u201dHarol could feel mana like his father, but could not use it. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t know that Rosalyn was a mage. Of course, the reason that he couldn't feel Raon\u2019s presence was because his skills were too weak.Harol could see how calm and confident Cale was and decided to ask.\u201cWhat is the Roan Kingdom planning to do with the Magic Tower?\u201dCale started to frown as he made it very clear to Harol.\u201cThe Magic Tower is mine.\u201dHarol observed the red-haired man who spoke confidently while looking out the window.\u201cI do not share my things with anyone else.\u201dHe would have to be crazy to give this to the kingdom. Cale thought about all of the time he spent to get here. There was no way he would give this up. The Magic Tower would become an ingredient for him to create the sturdiest castle for his territory.Cale could see that Harol\u2019s eyes were filled with complications and confusion.\u2018He probably is going through all sorts of scenarios in his head because he is so smart.\u2019The final goal of this crazy bastard was to destroy all mages in the world. Harol respected and hoped for a world where everyone just relied on their strength or things like ancient powers.It was funny, since the world Harol was trying to create would be even worse when it came to comparisons between the people who had abilities and the people who did not. That was why Cale called him a crazy bastard.\u201c...Young master Cale, is it not that you want the mages of the Whipper Kingdom?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dCale scoffed to show that he was being honest when he answered. He already had Raon Miru, the Black Dragon with him.\u201cI do not need any more mages around me. An even greater existence is by my side.\u201d- ...Human, I like the view from up here! The great Raon is right here human!Cale could hear Raon\u2019s voice, but he paid no attention to it. Harol had a complicated expression on his face. Cale was planning on sending the mages to the crown prince anyways. He didn\u2019t care about whether Harol figured this out or not. He wasn\u2019t lying, since he personally would not take those mages under his wing.\u2018Of course, I will give some help to the crown prince.\u2019By some, he meant a lot of help to make sure that the mages ended up with the crown prince.\u201cAlright, Chief Harol Kodiang.\u201dHarol could see that Cale seemed to have no worries at all. He pointed to the door. It was at that moment.\u201cCale-nim, it has been 5 minutes.\u201dTheir alone time was over.Choi Han looked through the open door and announced the end of the time before adding on.\u201cAnd other people have arrived as well.\u201dOther people? While Harol looked confused, Cale started to speak.\u201cYou can hear the details from my people.\u201dTwo people entered through the open door as soon as he said that. It was Billos and Deputy butler Hans. Hans had a large bag of files in his arms.Why had Cale called Billos and Hans to come with him? It was naturally in order to put them to use.Harol could feel Cale\u2019s hand on his shoulder.Tap. Tap.Cale lightly tapped Harol\u2019s shoulder before continuing to speak.\u201cHave a nice discussion.\u201dHarol started to laugh at Cale\u2019s calm voice before returning to his usual gentle expression.\u201cI definitely will.\u201dHarol gave that short response before quickly heading over to Billos and Hans. Billos walked over to Cale while Hans and Harol were discussing. He then cautiously started to whisper.\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShould I make the deal under my name for now?\u201dThe transfer of funds was completed with Billos as the middleman. Billos would take Cale\u2019s money and deliver it to the non-mage faction. It was because of the difference in currencies and such.Of course, Billos would be taking the crown\u2019s money and not Cale\u2019s, but the non-mage faction had no way of knowing about that.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen I will leave a deposit and deliver the rest of the money within a month.\u201d\u201cYou take care of it.\u201d\u201cBut I do have a question.\u201dCale could see Billos licking his lips. It looked so gross that Cale motioned with his chin for Billos to hurry up and speak.\u201cThat, you see, how much were you thinking of spending?\u201dThe great Magic Tower held a lot of history within its walls. Everyone else believed that all of the devices except the elevator were completely destroyed. The citizens of the Whipper Kingdom also hated this building.Cale put up one finger in front of Billos. Billos seemed confused after looking at the finger before cautiously asking.\u201c...100 million?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOne billion?\u201dCale did not respond.\u201c...Ten billion?\u201dCale nodded his head at the cautious question.\u201cTake care of it within that range.\u201dIt seemed small compared to the tens of billions of gallons that went into feeding the army per month, but the non-mage faction needed money urgently to settle the needs of the citizens. The same amount of money could have different values based on the needs of the people.Furthermore, it was the crown prince\u2019s money and not Cale\u2019s money anyway.Billos started to frown as he quietly, but quickly, started to whisper.\u201cBut it is all destroyed? Well, the original Magic Tower would take more than even a hundred billion gallons to purchase, but none of the magic devices even work right now.\u201d\u201cThat is why it is a maximum of ten billion gallons. Bring the cost down using the fact that it is just a skeleton of what it used to be. Oh, and you can use more money, so buy a good chunk of the nearby land as well.\u201d\u201c...Excuse me?\u201d\u201cThere is something that we can sell that is worth the cost of this Magic Tower.\u201dA short period of silence filled the area.\u201cSigh.\u201dBillos let out a deep sigh.\u201cI have no idea what you are planning, but I guess we should always aim to generate the most profit?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen I will do what I can.\u201dCale started to smile after hearing such a satisfactory answer. Billos seemed to be at a loss of words, but still barely managed to smile back.\u201cMy heart is shaking after hearing such large amounts of money, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it is beating with joy.\u201dBillos did not retort Cale\u2019s response. He respectfully bowed before leisurely walking back toward Harol.The non-mage faction had no use for the Magic Tower and instead needed to do something big like destroying the Magic Tower to satisfy the citizens. Since it was going to be worthless anyway, they might as well make some money off of it.\u201cCale-nim.\u201dChoi Han and Beacrox approached Cale. Beacrox looked around the room before asking.\u201cAre you going to clean it once you buy it?\u201dCale gently responded to Beacrox\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of everything.\u201dThe moment Beacrox let out a sigh of relief, Cale stopped leaning on the windowsill and started to walk away. There was no need to look at anything else right now.He would be back at night anyway.***There was a big frown on Cale\u2019s face. He could hear Toonka responding to him.\u201cYou don\u2019t feel well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dToonka started to frown at Cale\u2019s nonchalant answer. The surroundings were very loud. The citizens were enjoying the celebration to welcome a new warrior.Toonka knew of their current financial situation, but this was more important to him. He needed to use the warrior name to draw people to them. That was why the chiefs had agreed to this dinner celebration.\u201c...You weakling.\u201dToonka seemed to be disgusted, but it was hidden through his swollen face. Cale just pointed to Choi Han.\u201cThe main character for the celebration is still available, so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I need to rest because I am a weakling.\u201dAlthough Choi Han did not seem to like it, Cale lightly pushed him toward Toonka and crew. Naturally, Hilsman was with Choi Han as well.\u201cHahaha! I can feel the will of the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s warriors! A celebration! This is great!\u201dThe Vice Captain really was good at socializing.\u201cThen goodbye.\u201dCale left the celebration area without any regrets. Beacrox was with him as a guard. Beacrox asked a question because they were heading toward Cale\u2019s crew\u2019s tents that were quite far away from the celebration.\u201cI just need to stand guard outside of the tent?\u201d\u201cYes, I will be sleeping.\u201d\u201cThat will be the official story.\u201dIt really was easy to talk to Beacrox. He didn\u2019t need to do any unnecessary explanations.That was why Cale had gathered the three others into his room. Of course, he needed to crouch to look at the three of them.On, Hong, and Raon were all sitting on the ground.\u201cDid you find him?\u201dOn and Hong started to smile.\u201cWe have a good feeling about where he may be!\u201d\u201cWe know approximately where he is!\u201dThey were very excited.Cale had already changed into another outfit. He then looked toward Raon and started to speak.\u201cTo the liege\u2019s room please.\u201dRaon covered Cale, On, and Hong with invisibility and flight magic before avoiding the gazes of the other people and arriving at the 20th floor of the Magic Tower, the liege\u2019s room. Since all of the alarm magic devices were already broken and only a guard was left at the entrance of the Magic Tower, it was not very difficult. Toonka had been adamant that as many people as possible took part in the celebration. He was oddly useful in times like this.Whaaaaaaa~Hahahahaha~Laughter and clapping, as well as even singing, could be heard echoing throughout the night. Cale could see the soldiers and citizens all gathered by a bonfire and dancing around. They seemed excited to be celebrating for the first time in a while.Cale put his magic bag on his waist before looking toward the kittens. The kittens slowly started to guide Cale through the Magic Tower. They moved stealthily, living up to their reputation as members of the stealthy Cat tribe, while Cale followed behind them down the stairs. He could not use any magic device since they would leave some evidence of being used.However, Cale then started to frown.He stopped exactly on the 15th floor stairs and asked.\u201c...Where is he?\u201dThis was how the novel had described Mueller.< Mueller used his small body to hide in a secret wall along the Magic Tower Staircase. It was a spot that only his family and the liege of the Magic Tower knew about. The coward hid in that location. He ended up being stuck there, too afraid of the guards to step out. >Which wall would it be? Where would Mueller be?Hong wagged his red tail as he answered.\u201cThe first underground level!\u201dDamn it. Cale had selected the wrong spot to enter. Cale held back his sigh before quietly using the Sound of the Wind and picking the kittens up in his arms. He then spoke to Raon.\u201cFollow me.\u201dCale\u2019s body moved very quickly down the stairs.Tap. Tap.It was very quiet, such that the guards outside would not be able to hear it.The Magic Tower\u2019s layout was 20 stories above ground and three stories underground.\u201cA, amazing!\u201d\u201cWe got down here in an instant!\u201d- You are weak, but as fast as my claw, human!\u201dCale listened to the compliments of the three, who averaged only 7 years of age, while he stood outside the stairs to the underground levels.\u201cAround here?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe kittens were saying that they could smell a Rat. However, even they could not know the exact location. Cale had read the novel, so he could open the secret door as long as he knew the location.\u2018It really described a lot of useless things.\u2019\u2018The Birth of a Hero,\u2019 took time to describe all extras and passing characters with at least one line of description. Cale only knew the location because of this.Cale took out a small steel rod from his magic bag. On and Hong flinched and looked toward him, but he did not care as he started to tap the wall and walk down one step at a time.Ding.Ding.\u201cWhere could it be?\u201dDing.Ding.The red-haired man started to mumble as he walked down the staircase that was lit up by glowing rocks one by one.Cale was feeling good that he would be able to save Mueller who, in the novel, was caught before almost starving to death and had to watch as the non-mage faction destroyed his family's bodies before they killed him.Ding.Ding.However, the kittens and dragon following behind him did not look so good.At that moment, Cale took another step down and hit the wall.Dong.\u201cFound it.\u201dIt looked just like the rest of the walls in appearance, but the inside of this wall would be different than the rest. Cale started to smile. He took out a magic stone from his bag and touched the wall.Cale was quite focused, as it required paying attention to a lot of details.\u2018There is a spot on the wall with five holes in the shape of a star.\u2019Cale managed to find the five holes in the shape of a star. He then put the magic stone at the center of those five holes. It was at that moment.Creeeak.A small noise could be heard as the wall moved and absorbed the magic stone. Cale took a step back.Creeeeeeeeeeeak.An odd noise was made as the wall slowly started to open. A very small person could be seen inside. Cale tried to give a friendly greeting as Mueller became visible.\u201c...Hmm?\u201dBut something was off.\u201cWaaaaaaaaa.\u201dThe very small coward was shaking intensely while having a pale face. It was as if he had seen a ghost, no, a homicidal maniac.It was different than what Cale had expected when he decided to be the hero who saved Mueller.\u201cWaaa, hiccup!\u201dMueller was even hiccuping. Cale tried to smile as gently as possible and greeted him.\u201cHi?\u201dHowever, this only made Mueller shake even more. On, Hong, and Raon all looked toward Mueller with pity.Cale was confused.\u2018Why is this punk like this?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why was he crying so much? Cale turned back toward Mueller.Both the dwarves and the Rat people were very short. Having received both sets of genetics, Mueller was smaller than both dwarves and Rats.He resembled the dwarves in fairy tales, having very cute features that would make almost any adult have the desire to protect this small person.However, this did not apply to Cale.\u201cI feel so bad for him.\u201dOn and Hong wagged their tails before approaching Mueller with pity in their eyes. Mueller started to shake even worse as they got closer. He was crying even louder now.\u201c...I feel so bad for him.\u201dCale internally snorted at On\u2019s words.There was no need to feel bad for him. Mueller was 30 years old and lorded over the others as part of the family that helped develop the Magic Tower. He knew about the Magic Tower\u2019s last line of defense, but did not use it because that would have meant revealing himself to Toonka and his crew. He was so scared that he just ignored his father\u2019s last wishes. [1]If it wasn\u2019t for that, there was no way that the Mage faction would have lost so badly.Of course, this was actually beneficial to Cale.Although he looked like a young and cute boy based on his appearance, inside of that body was a thirty-year-old man who knew the ways of the world. He knew that his own life was what mattered the most.Naturally, Cale preferred such a person.\u201cSooooob.\u201dCale was tired of seeing a grown ass man continuing to cry. He decided to stop the good guy act.\u201cHey.\u201dMueller flinched at Cale\u2019s voice. He started to shake again after seeing the steel rod in Cale\u2019s hand. He felt like this was the end of his life.Plop, plop.Cale placed some things on Mueller\u2019s arms while he was still crouching inside the wall. It was a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk. He had taken it out of his magic bag.Mueller\u2019s eyes started to shake. He cautiously looked up at Cale only to see a slightly annoyed expression.Eat it.\u201dMueller quickly took a bite after hearing what sounded like a command. Cale had an odd feeling while watching Mueller eat the bread that got drenched in his tears.\u2018...He seems to be useless.\u2019He had a bad feeling about this. Mueller looked like a totally useless fool.He was supposed to have the dwarves\u2019 technical skills and the Rat\u2019s stealth and meticulousness. This combination was said to have given him the potential to become the greatest developer and constructor. But why-\u201cT, thank you very much.\u201dWhy does he feel like such a doof?Cale had a bitter taste in his mouth. However, On, Hong, and Raon all looked toward Mueller with pity and approached him. They were trying to be his shield, as it looked like he was afraid of Cale.However, contrary to their intentions, Mueller was unable to even taste the bread he was chewing. Two purebred Cat tribe kittens and a dragon. At that moment, he heard a noise that brought chills down his spine.Ding. Ding.Cale tapped the wall with the steel rod. There was no reason behind it, he was just randomly tapping. He had a bad feeling about Mueller, but decided to take him anyway.The Henituse territory had a lot of sculptors, as well as skilled artisans of all styles. There were especially many artisans involved in construction. It was because they had a lot of quarries. That was why Mueller would be useful.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dCale\u2019s low voice echoed throughout the staircase. He started to get annoyed with Mueller, who looked like he was ready to cry again.Ding. Ding.Cale calmed himself by tapping on the wall with the steel rod. He thought about how he probably needed to be gentle with Mueller since he was such a coward. Cale put on a gentle smile as he asked Mueller.\u201cShould I save you?\u201dMueller vigorously nodded his head. It was so energetic that the breadcrumbs started to fling off of him. Cale was satisfied with his energetic response and started to speak in a relaxed manner.\u201cThen you have to listen to me. Got it?\u201d\u201cY, yes sir!\u201d\u201cEat your bread first.\u201dMueller quickly started to eat the bread. Cale was satisfied with the speed and casually asked.\u201cYou know where the Magic Tower liege\u2019s treasure room is, right?\u201dPlop.The bread in Mueller\u2019s hand dropped to the ground. Cale gently added on.\u201cYou dropped your bread. You should pick it up.\u201dMueller quickly picked the bread back up. He was still crouching inside the wall with Cale, On, Hong, and Raon surrounding the entrance to the inside of the wall.\u201cI know that you know about the secret room. The real room for the liege of the Magic Tower.\u201dThe room on the 20th floor was not the real liege\u2019s room. The Magic Tower had more to it than meets the eye.Mueller\u2019s eyes turned chaotic. How did he know about the room? It was something that only the liege of the tower and the members of the developer\u2019s family knew about.At that moment, Mueller heard Cale\u2019s voice once again.\u201cYou also know how to get into the fourth floor of the basement, right?\u201dCale could see the shock in Mueller\u2019s face. The Magic Tower was known as having 20 floors above ground and three floors underground. Cale started to get an odd feeling after seeing that Mueller was looking toward him with fear, wondering how Cale knew about all those secret places. Cale felt like he had become a criminal, taking a hostage and threatening them for information. He had no plans to do that. In fact, his goal was to save Mueller and give him a safe place to stay.Cale started to smile and console the shaking Rat person.\u201cFirst of all, I will at least let you live if you do as I say.\u201dHe naturally had no plans to free Mueller. He needed to take him back home and put him to work. Cale could see that Mueller quickly responding.\u201cAnything, I will do anything you tell me to do.\u201dThe Rat and Dwarf mix halfling sounded like he was desperate.\u201cGood.\u201dCale responded to Mueller\u2019s desperation.Mueller\u2019s eyes were still shaking as he looked at the man who brought the scary Cats, Cats that were even scarier because they were pure-blooded Cats, as well as the Black Dragon with him.\u201cThen eat the bread and guide me to the fourth underground floor.\u201d\u201cBut you need a magic stone to go-.\u201dCale took a bag out and threw it toward Mueller before he even finished his sentence. It was a bag filled with many magic stones. Mueller quickly finished eating the bread that was still drenched in his tears.He then had to go down to the third underground floor with Cale\u2019s group surrounding him.The stairway to the third underground floor. In front of it was only the door to the 3rd floor and no other stairs heading downward. However, Mueller took a magic stone out and approached the wall, eventually revealing a mechanism on the wall.Creeeeeeeak-A cave was revealed accompanied by the noise. It was the pathway to the fourth underground floor.\u201cYou go in first.\u201dMueller mechanically stepped forward after Cale ordered him to do so. Cale was excited as he headed down the inclined pathway. The cave was dry without any humidity, and there were light stones keeping the path lit.The 4th floor of the basement.This was somewhere that only the liege of the tower, the mages who were secretly experimenting down below, and Mueller of the developer\u2019s family knew about. Cale walked down the path for a while to find a small door.\u201c...There is an alarm magic device.\u201dRaon stepped forward as Mueller stood there mumbling. Once Raon lightly waved his paw, the small door opened. Naturally, there was no alarm that went off. Mueller was shocked, but Cale did not care as he stepped in through the door.\u2018Found it.\u2019He had found the first treasure.What was hidden in the Magic Tower?The biggest secrets were the two research projects that the Magic Tower was conducting in secret.The names of the research projects were simple.\u2018A mana storage device that used the principles of ancient powers.\u2019\u2018The reason for developing magic resistance.\u2019A research that Harol would desperately want to acquire, as well as research that would take away the citizens\u2019 greatest advantage, were both held here.\u201cWonderful.\u201dCale could see the files under layers of security inside two large circular bins.The citizens who respected ancient power, and Haros who hated magic but also wanted to be able to use magic. How great would they have felt if they had found these research documents?\u2018But something like that will not happen now.\u2019These now belonged to Cale.Cale approached the large orb located in the middle of the two circular bins.He could see a seed resting within a fluid inside of this transparent orb that looked like a giant egg.\u201cHuman, that looks interesting!\u201dRaon approached the egg and squished his face onto the glass in order to observe the seed inside of the fluid.Cale approached Raon and patted his back as he asked.\u201cDo you want to try raising it?\u201d\u201cHuman, is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes. But it is mine once it is done growing.\u201d\u201cDeal!\u201dThe young four-year-old happily accepted a deal where he would do all of the work only for someone else to benefit from it. Cale had a satisfied smile on his face as he continued to speak to Raon.\u201cLet\u2019s pack up everything in here.\u201d\u201cOf course! I am curious about everything!\u201dIt looked like Cale should create a lab for Raon in the future. Cale started to smile, knowing how much this seed and the research material were worth.\u201cMueller.\u201d\u201cGasp, you even know, m, my name.\u201dCale approached Mueller, who was hiding at the entrance without coming in. Mueller looked back and forth between the dragon that made the documents and the large egg disappear into another dimension, and Cale, who was approaching him. He could not help but shake.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the liege\u2019s room now.\u201d\u201cY, yes sir!\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, human?\u201d\u201cSet an alarm device here and a few magic traps.\u201dThe fourth floor of the basement would be revealed once the Magic Tower was destroyed. Toonka and the non-mage faction would become even stronger if they found the items that were down here. Of course, Cale did not really want them to get stronger.\u2018Although they will perish faster this way.\u2019But that was not Cale\u2019s problem.Cale just blankly watched as Raon happily created some magic traps.\u201cOther humans cannot take all of the interesting things in here. I need to make it so they die the moment they step in here!\u201dCale watched the excited four-year-old with satisfaction, but Mueller\u2019s face continued to turn paler. Cale didn\u2019t care about Mueller\u2019s current mental state, instead, he waited until Mueller resealed the room that was now filled with Raon\u2019s magic traps before he grabbed the back of Mueller\u2019s neck.\u201cThe liege\u2019s room.\u201dThat sentence made Mueller respond while still remaining curled up.\u201cWe need to first go to the 20th floor.\u201dOn and Hong jumped into Cale\u2019s arms. Mueller, On, and Hong all shared the space in Cale\u2019s arms. Mueller could feel Hong\u2019s front paw on his back and felt like he was going to die. That made him develop the courage to say the following.\u201cI, I can walk- aah!\u201dBut before he could finish speaking, he needed to close his mouth because they were moving very quickly. Cale had used the Sound of the Wind to quickly rush up to the 20th floor.Mueller staggered before trying to stand once they got back up to the 20th floor. He needed some support as he seemed to be dizzy, leading On to give him some support.\u201cT, thank you very much.\u201dMeeeow.On gave him a smile, but Mueller started to shake as he avoided eye contact with On. He then started to speak after seeing Cale\u2019s gaze that seemed to be telling him to explain how to get to the secret room.\u201cThere is actually another floor in the Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cIs the 21st floor the real liege\u2019s room?\u201d\u201cNo, we do not call it the 21st floor.\u201d\u201cThen what do you call it?\u201dThe Magic Tower\u2019s liege\u2019s room. That was a room that the non-mage faction did not ever manage to find. Cale only knew about it because of something that was written in the novel.< Although the non-mage faction ended up finding the 4th floor of the basement, they would never learn about the real liege\u2019s room. If they had discovered it, the strength of the Whipper Kingdom would have increased by another step. >Cale heard Mueller\u2019s voice in his ear.\u201cThe 0th floor. We call it the 0th floor.\u201d\u201cGet it ready.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dCale watched the now quick and no longer crying Mueller with satisfaction. The moment a smile ended up on his face, Mueller\u2019s movements became even faster. Although he looked like he was shaking a bit, he was fast after receiving the unique traits of both dwarves and Rats.\u201cOh.\u201dCale let out a small gasp of admiration.Ooooong-\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be here.\u201dMueller moved some things on the floor of the liege\u2019s room. All sorts of devices popped up and Cale could hear the sounds of gears turning.Finally, once Mueller used a magic stone, a pretty loud noise echoed in the liege\u2019s room.Boom.However, the loud noise of the celebration allowed Cale to not have to worries. Nonetheless, he was soon full of confusion.\u201c...Mueller, explain.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dThere was no change at all. Mueller started to point, not at the room that still looked the same, but somewhere else.\u201cIt is over there.\u201d\u201c...Over there?\u201dCale looked toward where Mueller was pointing.It was the window.It was the large window that Cale had looked out of earlier in the day.\u201cYou just have to jump out.\u201d\u201cOut the window?\u201d\u201cYes sir. Then you will be at the 0th floor.\u201dMueller raised his head to look at the owner of the shadow that covered him. He could see into Cale\u2019s eyes.\u201c...You know what happens if you\u2019ve lied, right?\u201dThe steel rod shined in the light. Cale looked toward the shaking Mueller, who nodded his head and started to smile. He then picked Mueller up.\u201cAigo, what are you doing sir? You told me you would let, let me live!\u201dCale ignored Mueller\u2019s cries, instead, he looked toward Raon and the kittens before looking out the window. Cale sighed while looking at the three pairs of eyes that were staring at him.\u201cYou first.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dMueller was thrown out of the window. However, they did not see Mueller fall to the ground. Cale quickly followed behind Mueller.Cale did not need to experience falling down twenty stories.Tap.There was a platform right underneath his feet.\u201cI guess it is magic.\u201dThe real liege\u2019s room appeared as Cale made his observation. At the same time, he could hear the children\u2019s voices from behind him.\u201cNoona, I can\u2019t tell what I am looking at right now.\u201d\u201cHong, my eyes are fine, but this is weird.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dRaon just had a single word of admiration.Cale started to smile.< The liege of the Magic Tower was a greedy person. Because of something that had happened in his past, he was full of greed. >Gold. Jewels. Magic Devices. Money filled the very wide 0th floor.The entire room was shining and filled with things that would be worth a lot of money.< His greed was almost at the level of an average adult dragon. >\u201cIt really makes you think about a Dragon\u2019s Lair.\u201dCale headed toward a pile of magic devices. None of the items in this room were cheap. All of the magic devices were decorated with jewels, making it obvious that they were made for nobles or royalty.The entire room was filled with items like this.The liege of the tower did not use these devices, even as they faced death. That was because using it like that would not be for himself, but for everyone in the Magic Tower.Cale covered his face with both of his hands. He could see the slacker\u2019s life through his fingers.\u201cHahahaha!\u201dCale did not hold back his laughter. He let it all out. Mueller watched Cale for a bit before looking around the liege\u2019s room that he had known about for a while, but was seeing for the first time. He then stealthily reached out and grabbed the golden brooch that was closest to him.Meeeow.But he heard a chilling sound as soon as he grabbed it.On and Hong were wagging their tails while watching him. The Black Dragon also took a step toward him. Mueller quickly let go of the golden brooch in his hand.The thirty-year-old Rat could not do anything.On the other hand, Cale had a wide smile on his face as he looked toward the children.\u201cWe are rich.\u201dListening to Cale\u2019s calm voice that was very different than Cale\u2019s current expression, On, Hong, and Raon all started to smile. A jovial feeling, similar to the one down below in the celebration, filled the room.The Rat watched all this with fear in his eyes.1.

Beacrox pretended like Cale did not exist, and Cale also did not say anything as he entered the tent.Mueller was, naturally, with him.Cale let go of Mueller and sat down on the couch. Even without Cale saying anything, Mueller kneeled in front of Cale. Although there was no need to do that, Cale didn\u2019t care and just got straight to the point.\u201cI will give you a warm bed and a safe place where you will definitely not die. And, eventually, I will also give you your freedom.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale crouched toward Mueller, who was still kneeling.\u201cFirst, I will let you leave the Whipper Kingdom.\u201dMueller\u2019s pupils turned cloudy. He was afraid of both the citizens and other mages. Just leaving this place would make him happy. Cale casually put a brooch on Mueller\u2019s collar.It was the golden brooch that Mueller tried to take earlier. There was no way Cale did not see it happen. Mueller\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cI will also give you treasures like this. So, you\u2019ll be able to do a good job with whatever I ask, right?\u201d\u201cYes, yes sir! I will definitely do a good job!\u201d\u201cThen create a blueprint for a castle and a ship.\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201dMueller was said to have the potential to become the greatest developer. What Cale wanted was for him to develop things.\u201cSomething along the lines of the Magic Tower is fine.\u201dHe needed a safe sweet home and a strong method of transportation.\u201cHow should I make it?\u201dMueller\u2019s question made Cale think of his family crest.The Golden Turtle.There was something that came to mind when he thought of a ship and a turtle. Kim Rok Soo recalled the great Turtle Ship of Korea, but chose not to say anything about it. All he wanted was a ship for transporting and safety. The Turtle Ship of Korea with all of its exciting history was not necessary for him.\u201c\u2026Our family crest is the Golden Turtle. You figure it out from there.\u201dMueller will take care of it. Although he didn\u2019t know what the end result would be, Cale made sure to be stern with Mueller.\u201cWork hard, as if your life depends on it. On, Hong, keep an eye on him.\u201dMeeeow!\u201cSurveillance is fun!\u201dMueller was weak against children. In fact, he was very weak against children.\u201cI, I will work hard!\u201dCale listened to his voice as he thought about how he was satisfied with today\u2019s operation.He could hear the citizens singing by the bonfire. The celebration was still going on even though it was close to midnight.It was going to be a loud night.***The celebration continued until early in the morning, but it was calm after that. However, time still continued to flow during the calm.\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201dCale just waved his hand at Chief Harol\u2019s question.\u201cSo-so.\u201dCale was always at the best condition possible thanks to the Vitality of the Heart.\u201cIsn't it all of you who need to worry about your health?\u201dHarol and the rest of the Chiefs looked tired. Billos was the same way.\u201cI am not weak!\u201dToonka, who was drunk in the corner, was the same as well. Cale ignored Toonka and continued to speak to Harol.\u201cThings progressed faster than expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026There was no point to draw it out.\u201dJust one day was all it took to make the deal for the Magic Tower. Although it could have taken a long time, trades always progress faster when one side is in a state of urgency.\u201cMakes sense since you are all in a rush, right?\u201dNo matter what they did, the non-mage faction, which was a collection of the poor, was always going to be lacking money. The royal family would have given all of their money to the mage faction, and there was nothing inside the Magic Tower that was worth anything. But it wasn\u2019t like they could sell the magic devices in the kingdom, since that would only bring down their reputation.But most importantly, Harol probably wanted to get rid of Cale as fast as possible.\u201cDid you get a chance to read through the contract, young master-nim?\u201d\u201cI read it as soon as I got it.\u201dThe total amount was slightly more than ten billion gallons because it included some of the nearby land.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will destroy it within a year.\u201dThe contract stated that, although Cale purchased the Magic Tower, he will also destroy it within a year.He would also not move the Magic Tower building to another location.He would also not gather any mages under the Cale Henituse name.\u201c\u2026I really can\u2019t understand you.\u201dToonka glared at Cale like he was someone who came to show off his wealth, but Cale just shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI just wanted to own the highest view after the Empire\u2019s Bell Tower.\u201dToonka looked toward him with disbelief, but just pushed the contract to Cale as if he did not want to think about any more complicated things.\u201cJust sign it. I promised to spar with your subordinate Hilsman today. Muhahaha!\u201dCale\u2019s expression turned stiff as soon as Vice Captain Hilsman\u2019s name was brought up. The Vice Captain was very good at socializing. He had started to talk to the citizens about cooperation. Choi Han had reported how surprising all of it was to witness.\u201cYou just have to stamp here.\u201dHarol handed an ink pad to Cale. At that moment, Cale and Harol made eye contact. Harol gazed into Cale\u2019s eyes like he was trying to read Cale\u2019s intentions, but Cale just smiled back.Harol probably did not want to sell the Magic Tower because he was suspicious. However, he had no choice since they had a lot more to gain from selling it. It was difficult to ignore such gains.\u201cHere, I stamped it so you do it too!\u201dToonka refreshingly, and, if we want to be mean, stupidly, stamped his thumb on the contract without any hesitation. Cale also stamped his thumb on two copies of the contract. He then put his copy inside of his pocket. It was now Billos\u2019s turn.\u201cI, Billos Flynn, as a member of the Flynn Merchant Guild, will serve as a witness and the intermediary for the transfer of funds.\u201dToonka nodded his head and reached his hand out and Cale responded to shake his hand.\u201cLet me know if you need my help to destroy the Magic Tower. I can always help destroy that dirty building.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cYou can feel proud that you made a deal with us, who will go on to do great things.\u201dCale made eye contact with Toonka, who put some more strength into their handshake.\u201cWe will leave a mark in the history of this continent! You can go around saying you know of me! Hahaha!\u201dHistory my ass. Well, being defeated does go down in history as well. The contents of volume 5 will soon end. Cale didn\u2019t know what came after that.\u201cI look forward to it.\u201dCale just responded respectfully to Toonka\u2019s words.The contract was finished.Cale left the chiefs\u2019 tent and headed back to his own. Billos naturally followed behind him. As soon as Cale entered the tent, he knew why Billos had such a perverted smile on his face.Cale took the golden plaque out of his pocket and slightly turned it around. With a click, the top of the golden plaque opened like a lid.\u201cOh~!\u201dBillos couldn\u2019t help but admire it as a stamp of the royal crest appeared.\u201cWhat are you looking at so amazed?\u201dCale laughed at Billos before using the stamp on a note. This stamp with the royal crest would disappear after he used it twice. Cale passed a magic bag over to Billos, who was looking toward the golden plaque with greed.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the bag I gave-?\u201d\u201cOpen it.\u201dBillos opened the magic bag that he had sold to Cale.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dHe could see many magic devices that have been shrunk inside of the bag. All of them were magic devices for the nobles and royals. Billos then heard Cale\u2019s voice once again.\u201cYou will receive at least a few more of those bags in the future. Slowly start to sell them after about a month.\u201dBillos clenched onto the bag and cautiously asked.\u201cHow much do I get?\u201d\u201c30%.\u201d\u201cThat much?\u201dBillos could not hide his shock. It wasn\u2019t that 30 percent was large but the Cale that he knew was pretty thorough when it came to things like this. That was why he thought, at max, he would get 20 percent. Especially since these magic devices were no longer available for sale.\u201cLeader of the merchant guild.\u201dCale\u2019s voice accurately landed in Billos\u2019s ear.\u201cThe position that you wanted. You need to quickly take that position. The north and the sea routes will soon be flipped over.\u201d\u201c\u2026Another war.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d\u201cWhy would I share such precious information?\u201dBillos carefully put the magic bag into his pocket.\u201cPlease feel free to give me whatever you want in the future.\u201d\u201cSure. If possible, stay in contact with your uncle as well.\u201dHis uncle, Odeus Flynn. The man who was in control of the Roan Kingdom\u2019s Northwestern underworld.\u201cWhy my uncle?\u201dIt would not be long for the Black Dragon, Raon, to get his revenge.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason. No need for you to be curious.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dBillos did not ask anything else, instead, he handed Cale a magic video communication device. It was a precious item that Billos had worked hard to acquire, but Cale just took it and lightly tossed it onto the bed. Seeing Cale acting like his normal self, Billos started to exit the tent.\u201cNext time, I will contact you via video, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dCale ordered On and Hong as soon as Billos left.\u201cBring the children here.\u201dMeeeow.A few moments later, Cale looked toward the children that On and Hong had brought before he started to speak.\u201cThe duration is...\u201dHe stopped mid-sentence and let out a sigh. He was frowning as much as possible.\u201cHilsman.\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201dThe Vice Captain looked like a mess and smelled like alcohol after enjoying the celebration until the wee hours of the morning. However, his condition seemed to be fine.According to Beacrox\u2019s report, Hilsman was arm in arm with the citizens and enjoying himself as he got back to his tent.\u201cDid you enjoy the celebration?\u201d\u201cOf course! I have made a lot of friends!\u201dMaybe it was because Hilsman was the jealous type, but he was really a social butterfly.\u2018Will It be okay to send such a guy with Lock?\u2019Cale had some concerns, but there was nothing else he could do at this point. He looked toward Lock, the Wolf children, and Hilsman as he returned to what he was saying.\u201cThe duration is one month.\u201dCale was planning on starting his deal with Lock now. He opened up a map on top of the table and pointed to a mountain at the southern end of the Whipper Kingdom.\u201cMount Yellia. You just need to go find the item I tell you to find there.\u201dThe ancient power this time was one that was embedded in an item.\u201c\u2026Umm young master-nim?\u201d\u201cYes, Vice Captain.\u201d\u201cI heard about that mountain before. It has a very high summit, and the peak is said to be covered in snow all year long. I also heard that it is one of the top three most dangerous mountains on the continent.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dCale looked toward Lock instead of Hilsman, who could not answer.\u201cCan you do it? Yes or no?\u201d\u201cI can do it.\u201dLock answered without any hesitation. He was still timid and naive, but he was much different compared to when he had first met Cale.\u201cMaes.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cAll of you do not need to go up to the peak. Just support Lock from around the base.\u201dMaes and the children exchanged glances before responding vigorously.\u201cYes sir! We will definitely show you a successful completion of the mission!\u201d\u201cUhh, no need to be so passionate about it.\u201dCale waved at them before speaking to Hilsman.\u201cYou are the guide. Guide the children well, feed them well, and make sure they get their rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, I don\u2019t have to climb the mountain?\u201dHilsman scratched his head as he started to mumble.\u201cI am a bit afraid of heights.\u201dWhat the hell was this kind of guy doing being a Vice Captain? Cale suddenly had a lot of questions about the Henituse family Knights Brigade.\u201cDo what you want.\u201d\u201cYes sir! I will be a great guide and guard for the children! Oh, young master-nim, where should we return to?\u201dCale pointed to a location at Hilsman\u2019s question.\u201c\u2026Over there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUmm, are you sure you did not point to a wrong spot?\u201dHilsman\u2019s eyes could not move away from where Cale was pointing.It was one of the Western Continent\u2019s 5 Forbidden Regions.The, \u2018Path of No Return.\u2019It was located in Oorim, a rainforest that rained throughout the year. This path in that forest was one where many travelers went in and never came back. Nobody knew what happened to the people who entered.It was located at the border between the Whipper Kingdom and the Western Continent. Cale was pointing to that rainforest.\u201cVice Captain, there is a small village called Hoik Village by the Path of No Return. It is a small village, as well as the only entrance into the Path of No Return.\u201dIt was a very small village located at the most southern part of the Whipper Kingdom. That village rested at the entrance of this rainforest with no exit.\u201cCome over there.\u201dThe Path of No Return.In about a month from now, the Queen of the Jungle will be running amok inside of Oorim with her subordinates. Cale was planning on being her guide at that time.Choi Han, who had been standing to the side, approached him and asked.\u201cThen is Hoik Village our next destination?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCale was thinking about the last stage of the first step toward the luxurious slacker life, the \u2018money\u2019 step and started to smile. Once he took care of this business with the Queen of the Jungle, he would return to the Roan Kingdom to take care of Raon\u2019s revenge and some trivial things before building a sturdy house.\u201cWe can head there right away once things here are done.\u201dCale was meticulously preparing for the future beyond volume 5 that would soon arrive.***Three weeks later, Cale arrived at Hoik Village. It was sprinkling.\u201c\u2026Why are there so many gravestones here?\u201dCale looked toward the gravestones that started from the entrance of the village before responding to Rosalyn\u2019s question.\u201cHoik Village is a village that was created by the families of the travelers who went in and never came back.\u201dTheir desperate pleas for their loved ones to return as well as the hope that they would someday return had led to them remaining here and building this village. Those people who entered the Path of No Return had entered for many different reasons. However, with them never coming back, their family ended up moving as close to them as possible.\u201cHowever, people will eventually give up. Once those hopes turned into despair, well, those gravestones are the results of that.\u201dThe gravestones were placed for their loved ones who they decided would never come back. Hoik Village was more of a village of sorrow rather than a village of hope.Cale looked toward the large forest beyond the village.\u201cWhat a sad place. What are we doing here?\u201dCale casually responded to Choi Han\u2019s question.\u201cHope.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cWe will be the hope of the jungle.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just walked forward and cut through Hoik Village.Other than the gravestones all around Hoik Village, there was not much of anything else. It was a very quiet village.\u201cYoung master-nim, your umbrella.\u201dHoik Village, the village that was next to Oorim, the forest where it rained more often than not, also rained quite frequently. Cale used the umbrella given to him by Hans and headed toward the end of the village.Hans and a couple others followed behind him.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019The Path of No Return. The only entrance into the path appeared in front of Cale\u2019s eyes. Maybe it was because of the sprinkling and the cloudy sky, but the path into the forest looked dark and creepy.\u2018The Path of No Return.\u2019There was a large slab with those words on it at the entrance.\u201cMm.\u201dChoi Han let out a moan.Cale was observing the scenery in front of the slab.Even on this rainy day, there were people waiting at the entrance of the Path of No Return while wearing raincoats or just letting the rain hit their skin. These were the people who still had hope for the return of their loved ones.Cale made eye contact with one of the old men standing there. The old man\u2019s eyes suddenly opened wide.\u201c...Do not go.\u201dThe old man said that to Cale before stopping to lean on the slab and looking toward the forest. Cale just quietly watched the old man.\u201cYoung master Cale.\u201dRosalyn approached and called his name. She looked at the old man, as well as the rest of the people who were waiting at the entrance, with a sad gaze. At that moment, Cale started to move.\u201cOld man, it is raining. Don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201dCale put his umbrella next to the old man who was just standing in the rain and motioned to Hans.\u201cYoung master-nim?\u201d\u201cUmbrella.\u201d\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u201cShare with Beacrox.\u201dBeacrox and Hans made eye contact and Beacrox started to frown. Hans kept his mouth shut and handed his umbrella over to Cale. However, Cale did not have a reason to take that umbrella from him.\u201cWe can share mine.\u201dRosalyn\u2019s umbrella started to cover Cale as well.\u201cThank you very much. Let\u2019s go.\u201dCale just briefly thanked Rosalyn before turning away from the entrance to the Path of No Return. The rest of Cale\u2019s group followed him while the villagers at the entrance observed Cale\u2019s group for a bit before looking back toward the forest.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes, young master-nim.\u201d\u201cGo find an inn. Although there are a lot of inns, I\u2019m sure there aren\u2019t any really good ones, so just find a decent one.\u201dHoik Village had a lot of inns compared to its size. However, all of these inns were very shabby since the people coming here to look for their loved ones didn\u2019t have much money.\u201cJust why is it that everybody enters that Oorim?\u201dCale sat down in the first floor restaurant of the inn they picked before he answered Choi Han\u2019s question.\u201cFor hope.\u201d\u201cHope?\u201d\u201cThere is a legend about the Path of No Return.\u201dEven though it was infamous for no one ever coming back, people still went into it every so often. It didn\u2019t matter if the old man tried to stop them like he did with Cale's group earlier.\u201cSupposedly, a dragon lives in the Path of No Return.\u201d- What the hell are you talking about, human? There are no dragons here. The only dragon around you is me!Raon, who had been quiet, suddenly shouted into Cale\u2019s mind.Cale knew that there were no dragons here. He was someone who had read the novel.\u201cThat Dragon will grant the wish of the human who find his lair. Whether that wish is to become rich, cure an incurable illness, or even make someone have a happy life. It will grant any wish.\u201d- A Dragon cannot do that. Dragons are great and mighty, but we are not gods! What nonsense!Raon\u2019s complaints were the truth. However, such legends had a tendency to shake the minds of the desperate.\u201cThat legend is what draws people in.\u201dCale could see a rare frown on Choi Han\u2019s face. Choi Han probably did not like it. With his personality, seeing the atmosphere of this village, as well as people like the old man from earlier, it probably made him sad.\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t it be fine if we just destroyed this forest?\u201dThat was why Choi Han had no issues saying such a vicious thing without giving it any thought. Cale just pretended to not hear him.Of course, a fire will start in this forest. That was why, by the end of volume 4, the 5 Forbidden Regions of the Western Continent ended up becoming the 4 Forbidden Regions.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fine to just light it on fire and burn it down?\u201dAs Choi Han\u2019s suggestions became even more dangerous, he could hear Cale\u2019s voice.\u201cWe just need to show that the legend is a lie. Then there will be no reason for them to go into the forest.\u201dAt that moment, Beacrox let out a sigh as he entered the inn.\u201cYoung master, I am back.\u201dMany people were behind Beacrox.\u201cYoung master-nim! I, Hilsman, am back!\u201d\u201cYoung master-nim, we\u2019re here!\u201dThe Wolf children and Hilsman all looked shabby as they entered the inn. Beacrox took out a pair of white gloves after looking at this dirty group.\u201cYoung master-nim.\u201dLock was the last to enter the inn. He approached Cale and handed him a magic bag. However, Cale blocked Lock from giving it to him, before turning to speak to all of them.\u201cYou all worked hard. Go get some rest.\u201dThe group all started to smile. After saying that, Cale reached his hand out to Lock. Lock cautiously handed the magic bag to Cale once again and Cale started to speak.\u201cAs part of our deal, the item inside is mine.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dThere was not an ounce of hesitation in Lock\u2019s voice. Even though Lock probably knew that it was an ancient power, he did not show any greed for it.Cale opened the magic bag to look at the contents before speaking to the group.\u201cI will be entering that forest.\u201d- What?Meeow?\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201c...What is it?\u201dCale looked around after getting such an unexpectedly strong response from everyone. Choi Han was frowning even deeper as he let out his disbelief.\u201cCale-nim, you really.\u201dRosalyn\u2019s eyes were extremely wide as she stared at him, and the kittens started to bang the table. Furthermore, Raon was going crazy.- I will be going as well. Weak human, you listen to me. Do not go without me. This is a warning. If I get angry, it will take less than five minutes for me to destroy this forest. [1]Listening to Raon\u2019s vicious warning, the last person Cale saw was Hilsman, whose eyes were shaking.\u201cUmm, young master-nim, are you talking about the \u2018Path of No Return?\u2019 I heard that nobody comes out of-.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201dCale continued in a very quiet voice so that the innkeeper at the counter could not hear.\u201cThat is not the case for me.\u201dHis hand reached to the side where On and Hong were oddly sitting apart from each other. Cale reached his hand between the two of them and touched the curled up and invisible Raon.Cale petted Raon and On before continuing to speak.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine as long as I have them.\u201dOn\u2019s eyes turned wide as she looked at him. Cale made eye contact with On before he started to whisper.\u201cOn, do you know why the Path of No Return is so dangerous?\u201d\u201cI dunno.\u201d\u201cFog.\u201dOn\u2019s pupils started to become cloudy.Cale was actually somewhat surprised after he first met On and Hong.Purebred Cats all had their own specialties. Of them, poison was very rare. However, fog was even rarer.If Cale was asked to pick the rarest existence in his group, he would pick On over Raon. Cale shared the secrets of Oorim with the little girl who could control the fog.\u201cThe inside of the Oorim is filled with fog.\u201dHe then started to speak to Raon.\u201cThere is something in the fog that makes both people and mana chaotic. That is why it is difficult to use magic in there. It is a power that is much stronger than Mana Disturbance Tools.\u201dThis forest was completely covered in this fog.\u201cThat is why a ground path is difficult.\u201dHowever, Cale would be fine as long as he had On and Raon. These extremely rare existences by his side allowed him to plan to make a deal with the Queen of the Jungle.\u201cI can do anything I want in there as long as I have the two of you.\u201dOn\u2019s tail was wagging and Raon\u2019s wings seemed to be fluttering, as there was a small gust of wind across the table.***Early the next morning, Cale was standing outside of Oorim. Naturally, the kitten On was in his arms. Following his order, nobody else was there to watch him enter.\u201cYou will die if you go in \u2026 you cannot come back.\u201dThe old man from last night seemed to have spent the night there, as he weakly warned Cale from next to the slab. Someone important to this old man had probably went into the forest, desperate to find the dragon of the legend as well.\u201cOld man, I will break the legend and come back, so you can wait for me if you want.\u201dCale smiled at the old man\u2019s shaking eyes before he entered Oorim without any hesitation. He walked quickly and soon found that he could not see very far.It was the fog. The fog had surrounded him.\u201cMm, it does look like I will need to use about my front paw\u2019s worth of strength jn order to use magic. Human, you need to be at least at my level to use magic in this fog.\u201d\u201cRaon, you really are amazing.\u201d\u201cYes, I am great and mighty. But what is the Queen\u2019s wish?\u201dRaon, who had heard a brief explanation last night, asked for more details from Cale, who responded without any delay.\u201cPutting out the fire in the jungle.\u201d\u201cFire?\u201dLitana, the Queen of the Jungle.She was the ruler of this wide southern territory that was larger than even the empire.\u2018She\u2019s someone who is pretty similar to Toonka.\u2019She never showed any weakness to the strong while she was very weak to the weak.The reason such a person was secretly in this forest was because she was desperate to find a solution.Instead of explaining to Raon and On, who were tilting their heads in confusion, he started to say something else. His expression was serious.\u201cStarting from today, I am a good person.\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly introducing yourself?\u201dRaon looked toward Cale with confusion. On also looked at him with a gaze that seemed to be asking why Cale was stating something so obvious. This made Cale at a loss of words for a moment, but soon Cale finally started to speak to On.\u201cOn, the path.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dOn\u2019s eyes sparkled before her front paw started to move. The fog moved away following the movement of her paw.\u201cThe fog in here is interesting. It doesn\u2019t seem like regular fog. It is similar to a poisonous fog.\u201dListening to the curious On\u2019s words, Cale walked deeper into the fog, even though he could not see anything in front of him. The fog did not disperse, even when it rained. Cale brushed some rain water off of his raincoat.\u201cCan you see the path through the fog?\u201d\u201cI can see it!\u201dCale followed On\u2019s directions into the forest. He seemed very much at peace, as if he had come for a stroll.\u201cIt would be great if we could meet her today.\u201dCale was hoping to meet Litana, the Queen of the Jungle, today. It soon became night time.***Litana, the woman who had earned the title of the Queen of the Jungle, was looking out the cave.It was dark. She could only hear the sound of the rain.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYour highness, there is no need for you to apologize!\u201d\u201cLeader, no need!\u201dHer five subordinates all urged her, saying that she didn\u2019t need to apologize, but Litana could not help but have a bitter smile after looking at their condition.They had already been stuck in this \u2018Path of No Return\u2019 for two weeks. Although there were no monsters or enemies, they could not see anything in this foggy forest and their supply of food was going down.They didn\u2019t dare to eat any of the unknown plants of the forest, so they had been surviving off of one meal a day for the last week.Litana knew what was scaring her subordinates.\u2018We might die here like this.\u2019For warriors like them, there was nothing worse than dying without doing anything like this.\u2018Why did I.\u2019Litana was angry with herself for the first time.That damn fire. She had to come here because a portion of the Jungle was burning from a fire that did not spread but instead just continued to burn in that specific section of the Jungle.She touched the glass bottle in her chest pocket. A portion of that fire was inside the bottle.\u2018If nothing else works, I will just have to burn my way out of here.\u2019Although she shouldn\u2019t damage the forest, that was not as precious as the lives of her subordinates and those waiting for her back home. She looked around the cave that they happened to find. They would need to spend the night in this cave tonight.LItana, calmed herself down as she decided that she would need to make her decision soon.It was at that moment.Rustle.\u201cHmm?\u201dLitana grabbed her spear.She sensed someone outside the cave.Rustle, rustle.Drip, drip.She could hear the sound of the rain and some footsteps.Someone was headed their way.The gazes on the faces of Litana\u2019s subordinates who were around the fire started to change.Rustle.The sound was getting closer.Soon, a shadow appeared by the fire.Swiiish-\u201cWho are you?\u201dOne of her subordinates spears pointed toward the person\u2019s throat.\u201cWell, you see.\u201dThey could hear the common language of the continent. The fire slowly started to light up the man\u2019s face.\u201cI saw some light and headed over with joy.\u201dA red haired man was looking at the speartip and putting on an awkward smile.The fancy yet gentle looking man gulped while looking at the speartip and cautiously asked.\u201cIf it is okay, may I sit by your fire tonight?\u201dMeeeow.There was a wet kitten in his arms and both of them were shaking.\u201cMy raincoat ripped and we are so cold after getting hit by the rain.\u201dThe shabby looking man and kitten with a ripped up raincoat.Litana was cautious, but soon she started to speak.\u201cGet him a blanket.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help her mentality of a Queen, who was taught that she needed to protect the weak.The red haired man, Cale, was shaking as he approached Litana\u2019s group.- Weak human, beware of catching a cold. But why is your expression different than usual? Are you very sick?Raon\u2019s voice, which required him to use a paw\u2019s worth of strength, reached Cale\u2019s mind. However, Cale was hiding his plot from Raon, as he simply received the blanket and responded with a gentle smile and a respectful attitude.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dHe didn\u2019t look like his trash self, but an upright noble.The kitten On looked toward Cale with disbelief.Cale was slowly setting the bait.Teaser1. (PR: Raon is a yandere\u2026)TCF Chapters UpdateCloseHello everyone,As you probably have heard already, Korean novels have returned for the time being.

Naturally, Cale was the one who said it.Litana shook her head at the average looking red-haired man.\u201cIt is only normal between travelers. You seem to be cold from the rain, so please rest by the fire.\u201dHowever, her subordinates remained wary of him. Even if he looked shabby from the rain, he was still a stranger.What rain! He wasn\u2019t hit by rain at all! I did it with warm water!Raon was complaining about what Litana said.Cale had ripped his raincoat nearby the cave while Raon used warm water and temperature maintaining magic on him before he moved toward the cave.Cale patted On\u2019s back for acting her part well.Meeeow.On seemed to be anxious as she looked up at Cale.Litana was looking at the two of them with a stealthily sharp gaze.\u2018He doesn\u2019t seem like a normal person.\u2019Litana didn\u2019t sense it when her subordinate had pointed his spear at Cale earlier, but taking another look at Cale, the person in front of her had a different feel than a traveler or adventurer.He seemed healthy, but his posture and walk made it clear that he had not practice any sort of martial arts. However, he did not seem like he was a mage nor any other type of strong individual either.Her intuition was spot on.You seem as strong as the tip of my claw again.Cale\u2019s body was surrounded by the Dominating Aura right now.While Litana was observing Cale, Cale was also observing Litana through the corner of his eye.The people of the Southern Jungle, otherwise known as the Southerners, were known for their bronze skin and firm physique. Having a natural location like the jungle as their home, they were very close to nature.Close to nature.That closeness to nature developed into a very different culture when comparing the Whipper Kingdom\u2019s citizens and the Southerners of the Jungle.While the Whipper Kingdom developed a sense of, \u2018survival of the fittest,\u2019 and, \u2018struggle,\u2019 the Southerners developed a sense of, \u2018win-win,\u2019 and, \u2018leader and followers.\u2019An awkward silence filled the cave. The voice that broke the silence was Cale\u2019s casual voice.\u201cThe rain seems to be getting stronger. We should leave the forest tomorrow, right, On?\u201dThe expression on the man\u2019s face as he gently spoke to the kitten was as warm as the fire. However, On was looking at him with disbelief.\u2026Why are you acting like this?Raon was confused as well.Litana and her subordinates all looked toward Cale with stiff expressions. Litana was able to make a guess based on what the man had just said.\u201cUmm, Mr.-.\u201d\u201cYou can just call me Cale.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Cale.\u201dLitana could see that the man had a magic bag on him, but did not have a sword or anything else, as if he had just come into the forest for a stroll. He also seemed to know his way around.He had an odd atmosphere around him.She suddenly thought of something.\u2018\u2026Is he a dragon?\u2019She recalled the legend about the dragon that would grant your wish. The legend did not say anything about the dragon\u2019s appearance nor how it showed up. Litana knew her thoughts were probably wrong, but she could not help but become full of anticipation.It was at that moment. Litana made eye contact with this man named Cale and could see him start to smile.\u201cI am not a dragon.\u201dAh.She flinched as she let out a gasp. She could see Cale brushing back his wet red hair that had fallen onto his face.\u201cHowever, I do know the way in here.\u201d\u201c\u2026How?\u201dLitana and her subordinates, who had no issues around the complicated and irrational Jungle, were lost in this forest. However, this man in front of them knew the way in here?Seeing Litana\u2019s confusion on her face, Cale started to smile and answered back.\u201cThis child is from the Cat tribe.\u201dCale petted On with a gentle gaze that seemed to fit the gaze of a saint.\u201cI happened to run into this child in the slums on a rainy day like this in the past.\u201dHe looked out the past. He seemed to be nostalgic about the day they had met. On recalled that day as well and knew that it was not such a nostalgic moment. However, she kept her mouth shut and her tail started to shake with uncertainty.\u201cThis child, On, can control the fog.\u201d\u201cWhat a rare power.\u201dLitana thought about the fog covering Oorim and let out her admiration.\u201cIt is. I learned about this place while traveling out from my territory. I read in an ancient text that this place was controlled by the fog.\u201dLitana turned her gaze from On to look back at Cale. She sensed elegance in his actions and tone the longer she spent with him. He was definitely at least a noble.\u201cThat was why I headed to this place with this child.\u201dCale\u2019s eyes started to sparkle by the fire. Litana and her subordinates could see it as well. Cale\u2019s calm yet passionate voice filled the cave.\u201cWe came here because we thought that we could use our power to give hope to the people who lost their way, as well as their family members who are desperately waiting for them.\u201d\u2026That wasn\u2019t it.Raon was mumbling to himself while On was just quietly wagging her tail.Cale had a tiny smile on his face after seeing Litana\u2019s gaze starting to change.\u201cThankfully, I was right. We were able to see the path once On controlled the fog.\u201dHe quickly explained the secret of the fog. He explained how it could make someone hallucinate and cause mana disturbance as well.\u201cI see.\u201dLitana couldn\u2019t hide the bitterness in her heart.\u201cThe legend\u2026 it probably does not exist.\u201dIf it was fog and mana disturbance, the legend about the dragon causing this was definitely a lie. Disappointment filled Litana and her subordinates\u2019 faces. However, at the same time, Litana thought it may be for the better.It was a much better situation now than when she was debating whether she had to set this forest on fire.\u201cThen is it possible for us to ask you to guide us to the exit when you are leaving tomorrow?\u201d\u201cOf course. We have to help each other in times of need.\u201dLitana\u2019s gaze became more gentle and warm toward Cale. He was as good of a person as he looked. She probably felt that odd aura around him because he was such a good person.Cale then had a disappointed look on his face as he looked toward him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure you had a desperate wish as well.\u201d\u201cThat is okay. There is nothing I can do about it. I am just glad that I do not need to set the forest on fire.\u201dFire. That word made Cale\u2019s eyes sparkle for a moment before it quickly disappeared.\u201cFire. It is a very scary word. I can feel how much struggle you must have faced since you are a Southerner who treasures nature.\u201d\u201cDo you know about the south?\u201d\u201cNot much, but I have read about it in books. I enjoy traveling and love beautiful sights.\u201dHoh, I see I see, weak human.Cale felt the chills after hearing Raon\u2019s response but continued to speak as brightly as possible.\u201cI read about how beautiful the Jungle\u2019s mountains, lake and everything else is. Now that we will be able to get out of this Oorim, I plan to visit there in the future.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLitana was full of disappointment, bitterness and sorriness. She could not lie or feign ignorance to this person who was looking forward to the beautiful scenery of the Jungle.Her subordinates\u2019 faces turned gloomy as well.\u201cUnfortunately, the Jungle you will see once you get out of this Oorim will not be beautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201dThe Jungle was about a day\u2019s worth of travel from Oorim. It was quite wide as it took up the majority of the south. However, why would Litana have come to this Oorim?It was because it was close to the location of fire.\u201cThere is a fire in the Jungle?\u201d\u201cWhat? Then shouldn\u2019t you put it out right away?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It is a fire that doesn\u2019t spread but also one we cannot put out.\u201dSeeing Cale\u2019s chaotic gaze, Litana started to explain about the fire in the jungle.\u201cOne day, Section 1 of the Jungle, oh, the section of the jungle by this Oorim is Section 1, a sudden fire started there. Water, magic, incantations, nothing seemed to work on it. We were very worried, but it just remained in Section 1 without spreading elsewhere.\u201dShe started to mumble with a bitter expression.\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether that is good or bad.\u201dIt was an odd fire.However, Cale knew the identity of this fire.A fire that could not be put out through magic or incantations.The answer was alchemy.Alchemy was more scientific than magic. There was an Empire that was very developed in Alchemy and nothing else.The Mogoru Empire.The Empire with the Alchemists\u2019 Bell Tower was the one who caused this fire.\u2018To be more accurate, it is the imperial prince of the Mogoru Empire.\u2019The imperial prince who was worried about Litana who managed to unify the fifteen sections of the Jungle had stealthily caused this fire.However, no secrets could remain secrets forever. By the end of volume 4, Litana, who caused a fire in Oorim to escape finds out that the imperial prince is responsible for the Jungle\u2019s fire and partners with Toonka, even though his philosophy of \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 was not a match with theirs, to take on the Mogoru Empire.The Queen who rides a Black Panther instead of a horse led her warriors to protect the Jungle.\u2018But that isn\u2019t my problem.\u2019Cale did not want to take part in that at all. He was just going to take care of the fire and get paid for it, before taking care of a few other things and returning to the Henituse territory.It was because he did not want to see the imperial prince of the Mogoru Empire.\u2018He\u2019s not a good person.\u2019Crown prince Alberu and the Empire\u2019s imperial prince were similar people. That was why Cale could consider him to be a peer, but it was a bit different.Crown prince Alberu cared about justice. That was why it was easy for Cale to talk to and put him to use.However, the Imperial Prince was not like that.He only cared for himself.He was also very sly and insidious.He was similar to Cale but different. Cale pushed away his thoughts about the Imperial Prince who wanted to take control of everything at the center of the Western Continent and quickly moved the muscles of his face.He made himself look concerned.\u201cIs it a big fire?\u201d\u201c\u2026I have never seen such a large fire in my life. It shoots high up into the sky whether it is day or night, making it feel like there is an explosion every day.\u201d\u201cThen it is probably difficult to approach as well.\u201d\u201cYes. Neither animals nor humans can get close. Just getting close makes it feel like we will get burnt.\u201d\u201cTerrible, sigh, it is very terrible.\u201dLitana looked toward Cale who seemed to truly feel disappointment about it and felt grateful. It was rare to find a citizen from the center of the continent who cared so much about the South or nature.\u201cHowever, we will do our best to put the fire out.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dShe could see Cale who was nodding his head suddenly fall into a state of deep contemplation. However, it did not last long.It was very short. However, his eyes seemed to be full of determination.\u201cI, sigh.\u201dHe brushed his face after suddenly stopping and sighing. However, he ended up looking at Litana with determination once again.\u201cPlease take me to the fire.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe Litana Cale knew about was someone who was weak against the weak and tried to give anything she could to the good. She also returned any wrong at ten times the pain while trying to return any grace at one thousand times what she received.Cale had a very genuine expression on his face as he started to speak with a purposefully slightly shaky voice.\u201cI believe I may be able to put out the fire.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRaon started to shout in Cale\u2019s head.Weak human, what are you doing? You are very weird today! You are weak! What are you trying to do?Cale did not care as he still had a determined expression on his face.\u201cI believe I will be able to put it out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trash of the Count\u2019s FamilyCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: A Good Person (4)Silence filled the cave once again. Litana turned away from Cale in order to look toward her subordinates.She was trying to see if she had heard correctly.Her subordinates had the same expression that she had.\u201cMr. Cale, may I ask you to explain?\u201dLitana, who had been leaning on the cave wall, sat up straight. The leather armor had dried with the fire, showing off her toned warrior body.\u201cI am a citizen of the Roan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cYou are from the Northeast. We are people who work in the jungle as warriors.\u201d\u201cI see. I am from a small territory in the corner of the Roan Kingdom. Mm.\u201dCale scratched his cheek as if he felt awkward listening to Litana call herself just a, \u2018warrior,\u2019 and cautiously continued.\u201cI am from a small noble family. Thanks to that, I do not lack the funds to travel. I also have a crew that travels with me.\u201d\u201cA crew?\u201d\u201cYes. I came into the forest alone with On, but there are people who trust and follow me.\u201dLitana and her subordinates who valued the, \u2018leader and followers,\u2019 philosophy looked toward Cale a bit more gentler now.\u201cAnyways, as I traveled around, I was able to come across a fateful encounter.\u201d\u201cA fateful encounter?\u201dCale had a bitter smile on his face and started to scrunch his eyes like he was recalling a difficult memory.\u201cYes. I was caught up in an ocean whirlpool and barely managed to get out. Once I got out, I found this fateful encounter inside a cave. At that moment, I was able to find an injured person and have them. I was relieved to know maybe that was the reason I ended up getting caught up in the whirlpool, ah.\u201dHe suddenly put on an embarrassed smile.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That wasn\u2019t the story I was trying to say.\u201d\u201cIt looks like Mr. Cale has saved a lot of people.\u201dLitana looked toward the calm Cat tribe child On before looking back at Cale. This respectful and courteous noble did not even act arrogant because he was a noble.\u201cNo, I just couldn't walk by without doing anything.\u201dHe seemed very modest and good.\u201cAnyways, there was a power I managed to gain at that time.\u201d\u201cWhat power?\u201dLitana realized Cale had gotten to the point and asked.\u201cFire Suppressing Water. It is able to suppress any and all fires.\u201dLitana and her subordinates\u2019 eyes all became cloudy. It definitely sounded different than your average water.And that would be accurate. This water was different than your regular water.No matter what kind of fire it was, if it had the word, \u2018fire,\u2019 in it, it could suppress it.Originally, Toonka would have found this fateful encounter and used it as a base to develop a body that cannot be burnt. However, Cale was not afraid of getting burnt because of his, \u2018Vitality of the Heart.\u2019 It would hurt a bit, but the Vitality of the Heart would let him recover right away. Why would he use something like this in addition to that?Instead, Cale had put that water into the, \u2018Absorbing Necklace,\u2019 that Lock had brought back.Cale cautiously added on.\u201cHowever, there is a limit to how much I can use, so I am not sure if it will be enough.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dLitana let out a gasp. She opened and closed her mouth a couple times before finally asking.\u201cIt sounds like a precious power. Is it okay to use it for us?\u201dCale worked hard to prevent the corners of his lips from moving upward.There definitely was a limit to how much he could use.\u2018It is limited to putting out a fire about the size of the entire Western continent?\u2019As long as Cale was not putting out a fire that burned across the entire Western Continent, he had enough to last him a lifetime. However, it wasn\u2019t like he had lied to her.\u201cThat, how should I address you?\u201d\u201c...You can call me Lina.\u201dOne of her subordinates flinched. Cale pretended not to see and called out Litana\u2019s fake name.\u201cMiss Lina.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere is no precious or not precious when it comes to powers. I believe the important thing is how you use that power.\u201dLitana and her subordinates could see that Cale\u2019s eyes were clearer than ever.\u201cIf I can use this power of mine to save the nature, the animals, the plants, as well as people and their livelihood, I believe I definitely need to use it.\u201dLitana subconsciously started to clench her fists. Her heart was also beating quickly.\u201cOf course, now that it has recognized me as its master, I need to personally go there to use it. It might take some time and be burdensome.\u201d\u201c...Do you need to go into the fire to use it?\u201d\u201cI think inside the fire might be difficult, but I probably have to at least get near it.\u201dCale could see Litana starting to frown. Both gratitude and sorriness filled her heart. It was the same for her subordinates as well. Of course, two of them were still wary of Cale, but even they were grateful to Cale.Cale then launched the final blow.\u201cI will be very happy if my power can be of assistance. I want to save and help everyone.\u201d- This isn\u2019t the weak human I know. No, you are a good person, but still, this isn\u2019t like you. Anyways, saving someone is a great deed!The four year old became chaotic before coming to a conclusion. On the other hand, On just yawned and looked away from Cale.\u201cThank you very very much.\u201dCale put a gentle smile on his face in response. However, his eyes were coldly observing Litana and her subordinates.Litana had come to the forest, leaving behind the jungle and people she needed to protect, with a single ray of hope. They had been here for two weeks with no results.To them, Cale was no different than the dragon of legend.\u201cHow could we repay you for your gratitude?\u201d\u201cGratitude? No. I have not done anything yet. I just have a feeling that I was drawn into the forest for this exact reason.\u201dLitana admired Cale, who did not show even an ounce of greed. He really seemed to be a good-natured person.Pay back revenge at ten fold, while paying back gratitude to the best of her abilities.\u201cMr. Cale, I still want to repay you for your gratitude somehow. You are going to guide us and go to the fire to use a limited power. We cannot accept it all without giving anything back.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m really okay.\u201dCale put on an awkward expression. He then seemed to contemplate something for a bit before clapping his hand like he had thought of something.\u201cAh!\u201dHe looked embarrassed as he started to speak to Litana and her subordinates.\u201cI read about Section 1 in a book about the Jungle. I read that the combination of the vibrant jungle and clear coastline makes it very beautiful. It said that the sunset there was amazing. I remember thinking that it would be great if I could have a villa in Section 1 as I read that.\u201dSection 1 was the section that was currently on fire.The eastern shores of Section 1 were filled with rare materials like gold.In the novel, a shaman from the Eastern continent will end up putting out the fire in about a month. The shaman goes over to the shore to gather some sea water when he happens to find a gold ore.That gold ore was just the tip of this, \u2018Magic Stone,\u2019 mound.It wasn\u2019t a full mine, but just a pile of buried Magic Stones of the highest quality. The shaman keeps it a secret before gathering it all and running away.\u201cMay I go over to Section 1 to look at the sunset once the fire is out?\u201dLitana was suddenly at a loss of words. The beautiful Section 1 shoreline. However, that place was on fire as well. The man in front of her should know that, even after the fire is put out, the sights there would be terrible. However, the fact that he didn't ask for land or money and just to go visit there was surprising to her.That was why she was the first to bring it up.\u201cI don\u2019t think seeing it is enough.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI will build a villa there for you. If you are not satisfied with Section 1, I will build it anywhere in the Jungle for you.\u201d\u201cN, no, there is no need for that. That\u2019s too much! I really am okay.\u201dCale had to work really hard to keep his lips from forming a smile.\u201cNo, I will build a villa for you.\u201d\u201cAh, well, if you insist.\u201dCale put on an expression of, \u2018there's nothing I can do,\u2019 as he answered.\u201cIf I am able to help you put out the fire, the villa is too much. May I just ask for a small plot of land where I can build a villa?\u201dLitana could tell that, although Cale said he was from a small noble family, that really may not be the case. Based on the material of his clothes, the size of his magic bag, as well as his elegance, he definitely was someone who could easily buy things like villas or land.\u201cYes, of course. I will give you as much land as you want. In fact, I insist. I will only be satisfied if you do so.\u201d\u2018Great.\u2019Cale held back his cheer and let out a sigh as he nodded.\u201cYes, I will make sure to do so.\u201dHe made it look like he had no interest in the land of the Jungle, but had agreed since Litana insisted. That made Litana decide that, if everything goes well, she would give more than what Cale wants to accept in order to repay this debt of gratitude.Cale knew very well about Litana\u2019s nature. Cale made eye contact with On as he continued to pet her.\u2018Your goal is the land, right?\u2019On\u2019s gaze seemed to be asking that question, but Cale pretended not to notice as he opened his magic bag.\u201cWould you like something to eat? All of you look a bit famished.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dCale took out the food he had Beacrox make for him from the bag. He knew the most basic way of turning someone to your side.\u2018Someone who feeds you is a good person.\u2019That was how he had earned Choi Han\u2019s trust as well. Cale touched the blanket that Litana\u2019s subordinate had handed him as he continued to speak.\u201cYou can treat it as the cost of this blanket. Let\u2019s share a meal together and move tomorrow.\u201dThe atmosphere went from casual to very friendly.\u201cFirst, we will return to the village where my crew is at and then cut through the forest to the Jungle. Please go on and eat.\u201dCale continued to lay it on thick for Litana and her subordiantes.\u201cYou can\u2019t use any strength to save the jungle if you don\u2019t eat.\u201dCale\u2019s words made Litana and her subordinates think about the people waiting for them. As for Cale, the Magic Stones were waiting for him.Litana looked toward the food that was still fresh and warm because it had been in the magic bag and grabbed the fork that Cale handed her. She then started to mumble.\u201cThe legend was not very far away.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCale had heard the whole thing, but pretended like he did not hear a word.\u201cNo, nothing. This is delicious, Mr. Cale.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dLitana and her subordinates were able to have a relaxing and full night for the first time in two weeks. On peeked at Cale, who watched them with satisfaction before letting out a sigh.***\u201cMr. Cale, this is amazing.\u201d\u201cRight? On is amazing.\u201dCale peeked at Litana and her subordinates, who were following behind him. Looking at the six of them under the sun made it very easy to see that they were strong warriors.There were two different types of warriors in the Southern continent.\u00a0[1]Someone like Toonka was the, \u2018fighter,\u2019 type while the Northern Knights were more the, \u2018warriors.\u2019 The people of the Jungle were a mix of the two. They were both good at fighting and at training their martial arts or weapon arts.\u201cMiss Lina, we are almost at Hoik Village.\u201dCale could see Litana and her subordinates tighten the raincoats around them after hearing his words. They had suddenly ended up crossing the border, so they were covering themselves up as much as possible with their dark blue raincoats.Litana was especially making sure to cover her black hair. The royal family had pitch black hair. Since she was on a smaller side for a Southerner and was working hard in order to hide her identity, it was difficult for anyone to tell that Litana was a strong warrior.However, Cale knew the truth.\u2018One level under Choi Han.\u2019She was much stronger than Toonka. One level under Choi Han meant that she was very strong. Once she got on her Black Panther and used her spears, nobody was able to catch her. She was like the reaper of death to her enemies, even in broad daylight, as she moved around in the jungle that was dark from the shadows of the forest. That was how she had become the Queen who unified the Jungle.The head of the Jungle needed to both be empathetic and strong. They needed to protect their tribe.\u201cWe are almost there.\u201dCale could feel Litana\u2019s group behind him as he started to walk forward once again. On was controlling the fog to open up a path for them.The fog started to move away.\u201cAh.\u201dLitana\u2019s subordinates let out a gasp. They could feel that they were finally getting out of this, \u2018Path of No Return.\u2019 Cale just continued to walk in silence.Litana and her subordinates trusted Cale even more as they watched him leisurely walk down the path.Drip. Drip.The rain fell on the new raincoat that Cale had received from Litana.- We are here.Finally, the fog lifted and they could see the entrance of Hoik Village. He had returned.\u201cHa.\u201dA gasp-like laughter escaped from Cale\u2019s mouth.Meeeow!On jumped out of Cale\u2019s arms and started to run.Meeow!Hong ran toward her as well. The siblings ran into each other and started to rub their cheeks against each other. Cale had his arms crossed as he watched the two kittens before starting to frown after seeing the people standing next to the slab.\u201cWhy are you all out here in the rain?\u201dHans, Choi Han and Rosalyn were all waiting for him. None of them responded, instead, they all just pretended as if they didn\u2019t hear him.\u201cYoung master-nim, as the deputy butler, I could not go to sleep.\u201d\u201cCale-nim, it is cold. Who are the people behind you?\u201d\u201cYoung master Cale, did you have a good trip?\u201dCale uncrossed his arms and headed to them. He stood in front of them and started to speak.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dCale didn\u2019t want to see the smiles on their faces, so he turned around. His gaze then fell on the people who were staring at him. It was the families of the people who had gone in and never came back.Cale headed toward the old man who was sitting next to the slab. It was the same one who had warned him about going into the forest. He then crouched down next to the old man. The old man\u2019s eyes were shaking in disbelief.Cale confidently spoke to the old man.\u201cOld man.\u201dCale, no, Kim Rok Soo, knew what it was like to wait for something that was never going to come back. He knew that his parents were dead, but, at one point, he had hoped that they would come back if he waited long enough. Cale looked directly into the old man\u2019s eyes.\u201cThere is no dragon.\u201dThe legend was no more.The old man\u2019s eyes slowly started to tear up. The old man quietly looked down at the ground before nodding his head over and over. Cale walked past the old man and the others before casually adding on.\u201cI saw some clothes and skeletons in the forest. I can bring them for you if you\u2019d like.\u201dThat was the only thing Cale could do for them.He returned to his crew and started to speak to Choi Han and the rest, who were looking back and forth between him and Litana\u2019s group, who were wearing a different style of clothing.\u201cPack our stuff.\u201dHe pointed to the forest.\u201cWe are heading to the Jungle.\u201dThe fire that enveloped the entire Section 1 of the Jungle. It was time for Cale to suppress that fire on his own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
